    "entanglement in continuous variables has been of great interest since the celebrated paper of einstein , podolsky and rosen ( epr ) @xcite who constructed a two - particle state which was strongly entangled both in position and momentum spaces .",
    "the epr state has been the subject of many discussions on the nonlocality of quantum mechanics .",
    "it turns out that the epr state can be physically realized in a high gain parametric amplifier .",
    "this opened up the possibility of a variety of new experiments @xcite using entanglement in continuous variables .",
    "the wigner function for such states is gaussian in position and momentum variables @xcite .",
    "the gaussian states are very special in the sense that the information on the higher order correlations can be extracted from second order correlations .",
    "the criteria for entanglement these states has been formulated in terms of second order correlations between position and momentum variables @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived an equivalent set of criteria .",
    "a great advantage of these inequalities is that the transpose criteria has been translated into something which is directly measurable . in this paper",
    "we focus our attention on the entangled character of a family of non - gaussian states , viz . ,",
    "the pair coherent states .",
    "these states are entangled since the expression for pair coherent states is already in schmidt form .",
    "we examine its entanglement character in terms of the peres - horodecki criteria .",
    "we calculate explicitly the eigenvalues of the partial transpose of the density matrix and show that some of these are negative .",
    "we also present results on the correlation entropy and linear entropy .    to setup an experiment to quantitatively measure entanglement",
    ", one can think of quasi - probability distribution functions , viz . the glauber - sudarshan p - function , q - function , and the wigner function .",
    "we study the relationship between the non - classicality the p - function of the state and entanglement .",
    "it is known that if p - function of the state is well - behaved , then the state is separable .",
    "we study the p - function for the pair coherent state to show the entangled nature of the state .",
    "we also check the entanglement in pair coherent state using the inequalities for second order moments .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the family of bipartite non - gaussian states of radiation field .",
    "we describe their properties briefly . in sec .",
    "iii , we investigate the inseparability of the pair coherent states in light of peres - horodecki criterion and von neumann entropies . later we discuss the relation between entanglement and non - classicality of p - function .",
    "finally we study the existing separability inequality to detect entanglement in the pair coherent state .",
    "the simplest examples of non - gaussian states of the field are , say , the single photon states . other examples could be states generated by excitations on a gaussian state @xcite .",
    "the state which has been extensively studied for its nonclassical properties and violation of bell inequalities @xcite is the pair coherent state @xcite .",
    "a pair coherent state @xmath0 is the state of a two - mode radiation field @xcite with the following properties : @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the annihilation operators associated with two modes , @xmath4 is a complex number , and @xmath5 is the degeneracy parameter .",
    "the pair coherent state for @xmath6 ( corresponding to equal photon number in both the modes ) is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the modified bessel function of order zero .",
    "the coordinate space wave function is given by @xmath10\\ ; , \\label{space_pcs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is a harmonic oscillator wave function given in terms of the hermite polynomial as @xmath12    it is clear from the expression ( [ space_pcs ] ) that the wave function of the pair coherent state is non - gaussian .",
    "we have shown the quadrature distribution @xmath13 of the state ( [ space_pcs ] ) in figure [ fig0 ] .",
    "the distribution reflects the entanglement present in the state .",
    "note that the pair coherent state can be obtained by projecting the two - mode coherent state @xmath14 onto a space with a fixed difference of the number photons in two modes .",
    "the well known squeezed vacuum state with gaussian wave function is given by @xmath15 note that the expansion coefficients are different in ( [ pcs ] ) where the coefficients decrease quickly with increase in @xmath16 .",
    "in this section we quantitatively study the entanglement in pair coherent state . note that the state ( [ pcs ] ) has an obvious form of schmidt decomposition .",
    "this reflects the fact that this state is an entangled state . in the next subsections , we examine the other criteria to give an estimate of its entanglement .",
    "the peres - horodecki inseparability criterion @xcite is known to be necessary and sufficient for the @xmath17 and @xmath18 dimensional states , but to be only sufficient for any higher dimensional states .",
    "this criterion states that if the partial transpose of a bipartite density matrix has at least one negative eigenvalue , then the state becomes inseparable .",
    "the density matrix @xmath19 corresponding to the state @xmath20 ( which is a infinite dimensional state ) can be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",
    "hence the partial transpose of @xmath19 is given by @xmath23 one can now calculate the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the matrix @xmath24 as follows : let us start with the following set of two hermitian conjugate terms for @xmath25 in the above equation @xmath26 diagonalizing the above block of the matrix @xmath27 we find the following eigenvalues : @xmath28 and the corresponding eigenfunctions @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the relative phase of the amplitudes @xmath32 and @xmath33 and is defined by @xmath34 .",
    "clearly the matrix @xmath24 has several negative eigenvalues . hence according to the peres - horodecki criterion",
    ", the pair coherent state is an inseparable state ) with @xmath16 and @xmath35 replaced by unity . ] .",
    "note that if the phase of the parameter @xmath4 is random , then the state becomes separable , as then terms corresponding to different values of @xmath36 and @xmath37 drop out of the double summation in ( [ rho_pt ] ) .",
    "correlation entropy of a bipartite system consisting of subsystems @xmath2 and @xmath3 is given by @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the von neumann entropy of the system @xmath40 .",
    "if @xmath2 and @xmath3 are uncorrelated ( separable ) , then @xmath41 vanishes .",
    "now for any bipartite pure state , @xmath42 is zero .",
    "we have calculated @xmath43 for the pair coherent state as @xmath44 we plot the correlation entropy ( [ icorr ] ) for the pair coherent state with @xmath45 in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the correlation entropy for the pair coherent state remains non - zero for all values of @xmath45 which signifies that the state is inseparable ( entangled ) for all @xmath45 . for smaller values of @xmath45 , the entropy increases slowly ; but at larger values of @xmath45 , it saturates . note",
    "that the squeezed vacuum state ( [ sqz_vac ] ) is a very special kind of gaussian non - classical state , entanglement properties of which have been much studied in literature @xcite . for a better understanding of the inseparability of the pair coherent state ,",
    "we have compared the correlation entropies of the pair coherent state and of the squeezed vacuum state in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "clearly the correlation entropy of the squeezed vacuum state grows much faster than that of the pair coherent state .",
    "this is because , as @xmath45 approaches to unity , the squeezed vacuum state becomes much more incoherent than the pair coherent state . at @xmath46",
    "the squeezed vacuum state becomes completely random , as all the possible states of the either mode then become equally probable .",
    "it is well - known that the correlation entropy of a system with all basis states equally probable is @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the number of possible basis states of the system . for squeezed vacuum state , as @xmath49 , the correlation entropy diverges for @xmath46 . on the other hand , in case of pair coherent state , the picture is different at @xmath46 . in this case",
    "the states with lower occupation number become more probable than the states with higher occupation number .",
    "thus the correlation entropy for the pair coherent state remains less than that of the squeezed vacuum state for @xmath45 approaching unity , suggesting that the pair coherent state remains much more coherent than the squeezed vacuum .",
    "we further calculate the linear entropy of the pair coherent state , which is given by @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the reduced density matrix of the subsystem @xmath40 . for a pure state density matrix @xmath19",
    ", @xmath52 vanishes as @xmath53 .",
    "but for an entangled state , @xmath51 does not have the form of a pure state density matrix .",
    "thus , any non - zero @xmath52 provides signature of entanglement present in the state . note further that the linear entropy is closely related to the entanglement measure in terms of schmidt number @xcite .",
    "for a pair coherent state , the linear entropy is given by @xmath54 we show the variation of the quantity @xmath52 with @xmath45 in figure [ fig1a ] . clearly for any non - zero @xmath45 , @xmath52 becomes non - zero and positive implying entanglement in the pair coherent state . for @xmath55 , @xmath56 , i.e.",
    ", @xmath57 is close to unity .",
    "this implies that the state represented by @xmath51 is more like a pure state than a mixed state . on the other hand , for @xmath58 , @xmath59 , which means that @xmath51 represents more like a mixed state than a pure state .",
    "thus the state ( [ pcs ] ) is more entangled .",
    "further we have plotted the linear entropy of the squeezed vacuum state ( [ sqz_vac ] ) in figure [ fig1a ] . clearly for small @xmath45 the linear entropy of both",
    "the states show similar behavior .",
    "but at larger values of @xmath45 , linear entropy of squeezed vacuum state is more than the pair coherent state , i.e. , the degree of mixedness of the pair coherent state remains lower than the squeezed vacuum state for larger values of @xmath45 .",
    "so far we have investigated the entanglement in pair coherent state in terms of peres - horodecki inseparability criterion and various entropies .",
    "however all these criteria are not possible to verify in experiments .",
    "we will now the study the non - classicality of p - function for the pair - coherent state as p - function of a density matrix can be measured in experiments . for bipartite systems",
    ", the two - mode density matrix can be written in terms of the diagonal coherent state representation as @xmath61 it is known that if the @xmath60-function has non - classical character , then the state is entangled .",
    "we examine the inseparability of the pair - coherent state from the point of view of the non - classicality of the @xmath60-function .",
    "the glauber - sudarshan p - distribution function gives a quasi - probability distribution in phase space , which can assume negative and singular values for non - classical fields .",
    "there is another distribution function called q - function which is related to the p - function by @xmath62 which is always positive .",
    "note that if the function @xmath63 were like classical probability distribution , then @xmath64 .",
    "however if @xmath65 is zero , then @xmath60 must become at least negative ( referring to nonclassicality of the state ) in some parts .",
    "hence the exact zeroes of the q - function are also a signature for the non - classicality of the field . in order to see the non - classicality of the pair coherent state",
    ", we examine the structure of the @xmath65 function .",
    "the @xmath65 function for the pair coherent state can be calculated as @xmath66 this function has zeroes only if @xmath67 and @xmath68 are out of phase for real positive @xmath4 , and if @xmath69 , where @xmath70 are the exact zeroes of the bessel function @xmath71 .",
    "the smallest few values of @xmath70 are 2.4048 , 5.52 , 8.6537 , 11.7915 , 14.9309 etc .",
    "existence of these zeroes proves that the pair - coherent state is a non - classical state .",
    "however it is worth mentioning that , the notion that , if the p - function of a state is not well - behaved , then the state in inseparable , is not always true .",
    "for example , for a two - mode separable fock state @xmath72 , the p - function is not at all well - behaved .",
    "this motivates us to investigate some alternative inseparability criteria , which can be verified in experiments .",
    "we will show that existing inseparability inequalities are quite useful in detecting entanglement in non - gaussian state like ( [ pcs ] ) in experiments , albeit under certain condition .",
    "duan _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and simon @xcite independently have derived the separability criterion of a bipartite continuous - variable system in terms of the second - order correlations .",
    "this criterion states that if a state is separable , then the uncertainties in a pair of epr - like operators @xmath73 and @xmath74 satisfy , @xmath75 where @xmath76 for any arbitrary nonzero real number @xmath37 . here",
    "@xmath77 and @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) are the position and momentum operators for the subsystem @xmath40 satisfying the commutation relation @xmath80=i\\delta_{kk'}$ ] .",
    "conversely , violation of this criterion provides a sufficient condition for inseparability of states , albeit with a lower bound @xmath81 which for @xmath82 , reads as @xmath83 for a bipartite gaussian state , the criterion ( [ duan_crit ] ) is also sufficient for separability .",
    "equivalent necessary and sufficient condition for separability of gaussian states have been derived by englert and wodkiewicz @xcite using density operator formalism .",
    "they have shown that the positivity of the partial transposition and p - representability of the separable gaussian states are closely related .",
    "these criteria have been experimentally verified via the interaction of linearly polarized field with cold atoms @xcite , in atomic ensembles @xcite , and with squeezed light fields @xcite .",
    "@xcite have shown that separability of a state leads to the following uncertainties in a pair of epr - like variables @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "violation of this inequality provides a sufficient criterion of inseparability in gaussian states .",
    "we will now discuss the validity of the criterion ( [ mancini ] ) in case of a pair coherent state which is a non - gaussian state .",
    "we calculate the uncertainties @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( for @xmath89 ) for the pair coherent state @xmath20 .",
    "we find the averages @xmath90 and @xmath91 here @xmath92 is the modified bessel function of order one and @xmath93 .",
    "thus @xmath94 . in a similar way",
    ", one can calculate the variance @xmath88 which is found to be equal to @xmath87 .",
    "in figure [ fig1 ] , we have shown the variation of product @xmath95 with @xmath45 .",
    "clearly , the inequality ( [ mancini ] ) is violated for all @xmath45 .",
    "we can thus infer that the pair coherent state is an inseparable state .",
    "now we will discuss whether the criterion [ equation ( [ duan1a ] ) ] is applicable for the pair coherent state .",
    "the total variance @xmath96 can be calculated as @xmath97 we show the variation of the above quantity with @xmath45 in figure [ fig3 ] for @xmath98 .",
    "the figure shows that total variance remains less than @xmath99 for all @xmath45 .",
    "thus the inequality ( [ duan1a ] ) is satisfied for the pair coherent state under the condition @xmath100 thus the criterion ( [ duan1a ] ) is sufficient for inseparability of the pair - coherent state only if the above condition is satisfied .",
    "we have also compared the degree of violation of ( [ mancini ] ) and ( [ duan1a ] ) of the pair - coherent state with that of the squeezed vacuum state ( [ sqz_vac ] ) in figure [ fig1 ] and figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "it shows that the criteria ( [ mancini ] ) and ( [ duan1a ] ) are violated more by the squeezed vacuum state for larger @xmath45 .",
    "thus the degree of inseparability is more for the squeezed vacuum state at larger @xmath45 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the expansion coefficients in the pair coherent state [ see equation ( [ pcs ] ) ] decrease quickly with the increase of @xmath16 .",
    "in conclusions , we have studied the inseparability of a special family of non - classical states , called the pair coherent states which are non - gaussian in nature .",
    "we confirmed the inseparability of pair coherent states in the light of peres - horodecki criteria and various entropies .",
    "we then demonstrated that the existing inseparability criterion ( [ duan1a ] ) based on second order correlation , is applicable to these kind of non - gaussian states only under certain constraints .",
