    "the determination of resonance poles , uniquely defined as poles of the @xmath6-matrix in the complex energy plane , is a long - standing problem and particularly difficult for broad resonances or if decay channels open up in the vicinity . in these cases , simple approaches like a standard breit - wigner parametrization",
    "fail and more involved theoretical tools like dispersive approaches are necessary , see e.g.  @xcite for reviews .",
    "however , these rigorous analytic methods require powerful mathematical techniques which makes them complicated to use in many cases .    in this letter",
    "we introduce a method that was originally developed for the calculation of auto - ionization resonances in quantum chemistry @xcite to the field of hadron physics .",
    "this method is based on the pad - approximant , model - independent , easy to use and has a broad range of applicability .",
    "in contrast to other methods , see e.g.  @xcite , it only requires a set of real data points as input from which information on the complex plane can be extracted by performing an analytic continuation .",
    "we wish to refer to this method as resonances via pad ( rvp ) method .    in order to demonstrate this method",
    "we will apply it here to an analytical model as well as to experimental data for different observables in order to extract the locations of resonance poles and decay thresholds .",
    "we believe that the method represents a viable tool to study the analytic properties of a function given only in numerical form and that it can be used together with existing methods in a large range of situations , including the determination of resonance poles .",
    "this letter is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : pade ] we review the rvp method which is based on the pad approximant and was recently developed for calculating auto - ionization resonance poles . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we apply it to an analytical model for the spectral density function of some hypothetical particle in order to extract the locations of the resonance pole and the decay thresholds . in sec .",
    "[ sec : rho ] the method is then applied to experimental data on the squared modulus of the vector pion form factor , @xmath7 , in order to extract the resonance pole location of the charged @xmath3 meson . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sigma ] the method is applied to the s0 partial wave amplitude for @xmath0 scattering and the location of the @xmath5-meson pole is extracted . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ee ] we use data on the cross section ratio @xmath1 for @xmath2 collisions and discuss the possibility to predict the charm quark production threshold . we summarize and conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "recently , among the computational chemistry community , there has been a growing interest in the calculations of complex poles of atomic and molecular scattering matrices by using _ real computational _ results @xcite . in these calculations ,",
    "one first constructs a function @xmath8 based on real data points @xmath9 and then performs an analytic continuation to the complex plane by allowing for complex arguments @xmath10 . in the following we will adapt the pad - approximant approach suggested by landau et al .  @xcite .",
    "this approach avoids the need to calculate higher - order derivatives as necessary for a taylor expansion series or other methods which use the pad - approximant @xcite .",
    "the aim is to find a function @xmath8 which represents the correct analytic continuation based on the real values of input points .",
    "this function is expressed as a ratio of two polynomials , @xmath11 when given a finite set of @xmath12 data points @xmath13 , it is in general not possible to find @xmath8 exactly .",
    "we will therefore construct an analytical approximation to @xmath8 by using the schlessinger point method @xcite .",
    "the schlessinger truncated continued fraction @xmath14 is then given by @xmath15 where the @xmath16 are real coefficients chosen such that @xmath17 once the @xmath16 are determined , an analytic continuation into the complex plane is performed by choosing @xmath10 to be complex , i.e. @xmath18 .",
    "for further details on this method and the numerical implementation we refer to @xcite .",
    "in order to demonstrate and test the capabilities of the rvp method described in the previous section , we will apply it first to an analytical model .",
    "we choose the model to be for the spectral density function , or spectral function , of some hypothetical particle but stress that the method can also be applied to various other quantities such as form factors or scattering amplitudes , as demonstrated in the following sections .",
    "the model for the spectral function is given by @xmath19 with the self energy @xmath20 and parameters @xmath21  mev , @xmath22  mev , @xmath23  mev , @xmath24  mev , @xmath25  mev . when evaluated for real energies ,",
    "@xmath26 is understood to represent the retarded limit , i.e. @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "the spectral function is antisymmetric , @xmath29 , and correctly normalized , @xmath30    the resulting spectral function is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] and describes a single resonance as well as two decay channels .",
    "the decay channels arise from the logarithmic branch cuts of the self energy @xmath31 and open at @xmath32 and @xmath33 . the complex pole associated to the resonance peak",
    "is located on the second riemann sheet ( 2rs ) and can be found numerically by solving @xmath34 for complex @xmath35 .",
    "the self energy on the second riemann sheet , @xmath36 , can be straightforwardly obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : model_pi ] ) by using that the discontinuity along the branch cut of the complex logarithm is given by @xmath37 , which gives @xmath38 the complex pole associated to the resonance peak is then found to be at @xmath39  mev .    ) is shown together with three different input regions for the rvp method and the corresponding extrapolations .",
    "it describes a single resonance peak in the vicinity of two decay thresholds at @xmath23  mev and @xmath25  mev .",
    "the input regions 1 and 2 can be used to identify the complex pole associated to the resonance peak as well as the decay thresholds @xmath32 and @xmath33 while input region 3 can be used to describe the spectral function for @xmath40 and to identify @xmath33 . ]",
    "we will now apply the rvp method to this model in order to extract the location of the complex pole as well as the locations of the decay thresholds using only real numerical data generated by eq .",
    "( [ eq : model_rho ] ) as input .",
    "we use data points from three different @xmath26-regimes as input which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] .",
    "the first two input regimes are chosen between the two decay thresholds , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and therefore lie in the same analytic regime of the spectral function .",
    "both can be used to reconstruct the spectral function in this regime as well as to determine the location of the thresholds and of the complex pole associated to the resonance .",
    "from the first input region we find the lower threshold at @xmath41  mev and the upper threshold at @xmath42  mev while we find @xmath43  mev and @xmath44  mev from the second input region .",
    "the fact that the upper threshold @xmath33 can be correctly identified by using input points below that threshold is remarkable . whether thresholds can also be ` predicted ' when using ( noisy ) experimental data as input will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : ee ] .",
    "when using the third input region beyond the second threshold , we are able to reconstruct the spectral function in this analytic regime and find @xmath45  mev for the location of the second threshold .",
    "we note that each input region can be used to identify the thresholds adjacent to it and well describe the spectral function in between these thresholds .",
    "furthermore , it is even possible to describe the structure of the spectral function beyond these thresholds , but with less accuracy @xcite .",
    "the functions generated from the first two input regions can also be used to locate the complex resonance pole by allowing for complex arguments . remarkably , both yield the same result , i.e. @xmath46  mev .",
    "the difference between this and the correct result is negligible and can be viewed as the theoretical error of the rvp method , which in the present case is smaller than @xmath47  mev .",
    "in this section we will use the rvp method to analyze the aleph data on the squared modulus of the @xmath48 vector form factor @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "these data were obtained from @xmath50-lepton decays , @xmath51 , and represent the cleanest determination of the @xmath3-meson mass and width .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] we show the experimental data on the pion form factor @xmath49 from @xcite together with the input range chosen for the rvp method and the resulting extrapolation function .",
    "the input range was chosen around the resonance peak at @xmath52  gev@xmath53 and @xmath54 input points were used . by studying the extrapolation function for complex arguments we find the complex pole of the charged @xmath3 meson to be at @xmath55 with @xmath56 the errors represent the total ( experimental and theoretical ) uncertainties .",
    "the experimental uncertainties were obtained by extracting the complex pole not only from the central values but also from the upper and lower values for @xmath49 , cf .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] . the theoretical error from the rvp method has been estimated by changing the number of input points , which corresponds to changing the order of the pad approximant , and is found to be of the order @xmath57  mev , i.e.  negligible compared to the experimental uncertainties .     from @xcite together with the input range chosen for the rvp method ( solid red ) and the corresponding extrapolation function ( dashed blue ) .",
    "]    the averaged values for the charged @xmath3 meson are listed as @xmath58  mev and @xmath59  mev in the 2015 review of particle physics ( rpp ) @xcite .",
    "however , these parameters are usually obtained from generalized breit - wigner formulas and are not to be confused with the coordinates of the complex pole in the @xmath6 or @xmath60 matrix .",
    "we therefore have to compare our result for the pole position to other predictions for the resonance pole from the literature and find very good agreement , see tab .",
    "[ tab : rho_poles ] .",
    "we stress again that the employed rvp method only requires real data as input , in this case for the pion form factor @xmath49 , without any need for information on the imaginary part of the form factor such as the @xmath61 phase shift , in contrast to other methods , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "we also note that , in general .",
    "one finds more than one pole when using the rvp method .",
    "these additional poles are unphysical and can easily be identified by changing the input regime or the number of input points . only the coordinates of the physical pole ( and its mirror pole with positive imaginary part ) remains unaffected by these modifications which allows for a unique determination .",

    "as a final application of the rvp method we will use it to analyze data from @xmath2 collisions and discuss its ability to predict decay ( or rather production ) thresholds based on experimental data .",
    "in particular , we will analyze data on the ratio @xmath1 between the total cross sections of @xmath2 into hadrons and into muons , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the experimental cross section corrected for initial state radiation and electron - positron vertex loops , and @xmath64 with the electromagnetic fine - structure constant @xmath65 .",
    "depending on the collision energy , different flavors of quarks can be produced .    a collection of data on the ratio @xmath1 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ee ] together with two input regions used for the rvp method and the obtained extrapolation functions .",
    "we note that @xmath1 exhibits a significant increase at @xmath66  gev which is related to the production threshold of charm quarks , in particular of @xmath67 mesons ( see e.g. @xcite for details ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ee ] , only one of the pad extrapolations correctly predicts a threshold at @xmath66  gev while the other shows a smooth behavior .",
    "the prediction of thresholds in this case has of course to be treated with care .",
    "first of all , the experimental data are noisy which gives rise to a strong dependence on the chosen input points",
    ". moreover , there are several smaller decay thresholds and resonance peaks present in the vicinity of the input regions chosen , which limits the radius of convergence of the obtained pad extrapolations .",
    "we therefore conclude that a robust prediction of decay thresholds is not possible in the present case .",
    "we note , however , that the rvp method discussed in this letter is in principle capable of predicting decay thresholds if the input is precise enough and if there is a sufficient number of input points available , as demonstrated for the analytical model in sec .",

    "in this letter we have introduced a method that was originally developed in @xcite for the calculation of auto - ionization atomic and molecular resonances in quantum chemistry to hadron physics with the aim to identify resonance poles and to predict decay thresholds .",
    "this method , based on the pad approximant , only requires real input in order to reconstruct the underlying function not only along the real axis but also in the complex plane within a certain radius of convergence .",
    "the method is universal being model independent , easy to use , and it has a broad range of applicability .",
    "we refer to this method as the resonances via pad ( rvp ) method .    in order to demonstrate the abilities of this method",
    "we have applied it to several different situations .",
    "first , an analytical model for the spectral density function was studied and the resonance pole in the complex plane as well as two decay thresholds were correctly identified .",
    "then , the method was applied to experimental data on the squared modulus of the pion form factor , @xmath69 , from which the resonance pole of the charged @xmath3 meson was extracted in very good agreement with other predictions from the literature .",
    "in addition , we applied the rvp method to the real part of the partial wave amplitude in the @xmath70 channel of @xmath0 scattering and extracted the resonance pole of the @xmath4- or @xmath5 meson , again in very good agreement with the most recent and precise determinations from the literature .",
    "finally , we analyzed experimental data on the cross section ratio @xmath1 from @xmath2 collisions an found that the extraction of decay thresholds is possible as long as the data are not too noisy or sparse .",
    "we believe that this method does not only represent a viable tool to improve or supplement current determinations of resonance poles but that it can also be applied to a variety of other situations . in future applications",
    "we will further explore its potential and intend to use it , for example , to determine the temperature dependence of resonance poles for hadrons in a hot and dense medium or to obtain real - time correlation functions from their imaginary - time counterparts .",
