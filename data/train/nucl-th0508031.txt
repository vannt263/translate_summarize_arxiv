    "is predicted .",
    "the @xmath11-nucleus potential strongly depends on the model used .",
    "the dd model gives the deepest inner @xmath11-nucleus potential which is in the range of @xmath12 mev @xcite .",
    "the chiral coupled channel model predicts the @xmath11-nucleus potential in the range of @xmath13 mev @xcite , close to that by rmf model ( the @xmath14-@xmath9 coupling constant determined by the @xmath10 scatering length ) .",
    "the chiral models give shallower @xmath11-nucleus potential @xmath15 mev @xcite .",
    "based on the strong attractive @xmath11-nucleus potential , there maybe exist `` deeply bound kaonic atoms '' or kaonic nuclei .",
    "the existence of the `` deeply bound kaonic atoms '' , or , kaonic nuclei was already well - known in later 1990s @xcite .",
    "it was suggested that the kaonic nuclei could be produced by the ( @xmath0 , @xmath16 ) and ( @xmath0 , @xmath17 ) reactions @xcite . since then",
    ", the issue on the @xmath0-nucleus deeply bound states ( kaonic nuclei ) has been a hot topic .",
    "theoretically , there have been many works on kaonic nuclei .",
    "the binding energies , the widths , the production methods , the nuclear densities around @xmath0-meson , and other aspects were discussed with different models @xcite .",
    "experimentally , some evidences for the candidate states in the ( @xmath18 and ( @xmath19 reactions on @xmath20he @xcite , and in the ( @xmath0 , @xmath17 ) in - flight reaction on @xmath21o @xcite are reported .",
    "recently , by using the finuda spectrometer installed at the e@xmath22e@xmath23 collider da@xmath24ne , the finuda collaboration succeeded in detecting a @xmath0 bound state @xmath25 through its two - body decay into a @xmath26  hyperon and a proton @xcite .",

    "the static properties of kaonic nuclei are obtained by solving , self - consistently , the equations of motion for nucleons and mesons , which are derived from the lagrangian for nucleons and ( anti)kaon mesons . to describe the widths of the @xmath0 in nuclei , the equation of motion for @xmath0",

    "the coupling of the ( anti)kaon to the isovector @xmath29 meson is here excluded due to @xmath50 nuclear cores .",
