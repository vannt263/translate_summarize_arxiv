    "in the last year we have seen how string / m theory can be exploited to understand nonperturbative dynamics of low energy supersymmetric gauge theories in various dimensions and different number of supersymmetries . d brane dynamics in string theory is very useful tool for the gauge theory which is realized on the worldvolume of d branes ( see @xcite for a review and references on the interrelation between d brane dynamics and the gauge theory ) .",
    "nahm s construction @xcite of the moduli space of magnetic monopoles @xcite was found in @xcite by considering parallel d3 branes with d1 branes stretched between them in type iib string theory . by t - duality along the transverse 2 space directions to both d1 and d3 branes",
    "this configuration leads to d5 and d3 branes which by s - duality will become ns5 and d3 brane configuration .",
    "the mirror symmetry of @xmath0 gauge theory in 3 dimensions @xcite was due to the nonperturbative s - duality of type iib string theory ( see , for example , @xcite ) . by t - duality along the 1 space direction , we have 2 parallel ns5 branes with d4 branes suspended between them . as one changes the relative orientation @xcite of the two ns5 branes while keeping their common four spacetime dimensions intact , the @xmath5 supersymmetry is broken to @xmath6 supersymmetry @xcite . by studying this brane configuration they @xcite described and checked a stringy derivation of seiberg s duality .",
    "this configuration was generalized to the cases with orientifolds which were used to study @xmath6 supersymmetric gauge theories with gauge group @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite ( see also @xcite for a relevant geometrical approach ) .",
    "on the other hand , in the field theory , magnetic monopoles have been the object of intense interest as solitons which after quantization are complementary to particles that arise as quanta of the elementary fields .",
    "this has been developed by montonen and olive @xcite that in certain theories there exists an exact electromagnetic duality which exchanges solitons and elementary quanta and weak and strong coupling .",
    "in fact , @xmath0 supersymmetric yang - mills theory is the candidate theory with this duality @xcite . in brane picture ,",
    "the montonen - olive duality can be regarded as s - duality of type iib string theory in the limit of vanishing of fundamental string scale . in general , it is very hard to solve the general bps monopole field configuration but the systematic construction for the solution has been done by nahm @xcite , so - called nahm s equation which is some nonlinear ordinary differential equation . up to a coulple of years ago , the origin of nahm s equation was unclear mathematical artifact .",
    "however , the string theory tells us that it naturally comes through the d1 brane configuration suspended between d3 branes .",
    "this was shown in @xcite for @xmath4 monopoles .    in this paper",
    ", we generalize the approach of @xcite to @xmath1 and @xmath2 magnetic monopoles .",
    "the @xmath7 monopoles can be understood by embedding the gauge group into @xmath4 .",
    "the corresponding nahm s data are obtained by imposing some extra constraints to those for @xmath4 case . all these can be naturally realized by putting o3 plane in the d1-d3 brane cofiguration .",
    "the o3 plane allows us to construct the @xmath7 gauge theories .",
    "furthermore , it provides the natural geometrical origin of those extra constraints . in @xmath1 or @xmath2 gauge theories",
    "in this section we briefly review the bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfield ( bps ) monopoles @xcite .",
    "we consider the model with the higgs fields @xmath8 in the adjoint representation of the arbitrary gauge group @xmath9 with rank @xmath10 in the bps limit in which the potential of the scalar fields are ignored .",
    "this is the case of the extended supersymmetric models .",
    "the bps monopole configurations can be described by the following first order equations @xmath11 where @xmath12 $ ] and @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "the asymptotic value @xmath14 of the higgs field @xmath8 along some fixed direction can be written as @xcite @xmath15 where the @xmath16 commuting matrices @xmath17 span the cartan subalgebra and are normalized by tr@xmath18 .",
    "the simple roots can be chosen to have non - negative inner products with the vector @xmath19 in the root space .    for the generic value of @xmath19 with no simple roots orthogonal to that , the gauge group @xmath9 is maximally broken to @xmath20 .",
    "if some simple roots @xmath21 @xmath22 are orthogonal to @xmath19 , then the unbroken gauge group becomes @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the semisimple group corresponding to the root sublattice of @xmath21 .",
    "much physics of this nonabelian unbroken gauge group can be understood by taking the limit of @xmath25 of the generic maximal symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "hence we will mainly consider maximal symmetry breaking to @xmath20 for simplicity .",
    "the asymptotic magnetic field can be written as @xmath26 the quantized magnetic charge @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the dual of the root @xmath30 and the @xmath31 are non - negative integer valued topological charges .",
    "since each root defines an @xmath32 subgroup , we can construct the corresponding @xmath32 monopole solution .",
    "for maximal symmetry breaking , the monopole corresponding to each of the @xmath16 simple roots @xmath33 is the fundamental monopole carrying the unit of @xmath34 magnetic charge and with the mass @xmath35 . if some simple roots @xmath36 become orthogonal to @xmath19 giving rise to the unbroken nonabelian gauge group , then the corresponding monopoles become massless .",
    "the general bps monopoles in eqs.([asymhiggsvalue ] ) and ( [ magcharge ] ) and the mass @xmath37 given by @xmath38 can be understood as the multimonopole configuration containing set of @xmath39 monopoles of each of the above @xmath16 different fundamental monopole types .",
    "this is consistent with the analysis that each fundamental monopole is associated with four moduli corresponding to the three positions and one @xmath34 rotation and that the total dimension of the moduli is preserved in the limit of some monopoles becoming massless .    for @xmath4",
    ", the asymptotic higgs field can be written as @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "maximal symmetry breaking corresponds to all different values of @xmath42 .",
    "if some of the @xmath42 have the same values , we have some nonabelian unbroken gauge group . for the maximal symmetry breaking , we choose such that @xmath43 .",
    "the mass @xmath44 becomes @xmath45 the magnetic charge of the monopoles , @xmath46 , becomes @xmath47 with @xmath48 @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "the matrix representation of the higgs field and the magnetic charges for other classical gauge groups of @xmath1 and @xmath2 can also be done in a straightforward way .",
    "related to the later analysis , it is helpful to realize these matrices by embedding to @xmath4 .",

    "<S> we study bps monopoles in 4 dimensional @xmath0 @xmath1 and @xmath2 super yang - mills theories realized as the low energy effective theory of @xmath3 ( physical and its mirror ) parallel d3 branes and an _ orientifold 3 plane _ with d1 branes stretched between them in type iib string theory . </S>",
    "<S> monopoles on d3 branes give the natural understanding by embedding in @xmath4 through the constraints on both the asymptotic higgs field ( corresponding to the horizontal positions of d3 branes ) and the magnetic charges ( corresponding to the number of d1 branes ) imposed by the o3 plane . </S>",
    "<S> the compatibility conditions of nahm data for monopoles for these groups can be interpreted very naturally through the d1 branes in the presence of o3 plane .    </S>"
