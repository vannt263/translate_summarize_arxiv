    "recent progress in experimentally controling becs @xcite has shown , that not only single atoms , but condensed atomic clouds , na in these cases , can be quantum reflected as a whole by atom - surface potentials when the kinetic energy of the incident cloud lies within the threshold region of the potential .",
    "armed with these results , we suggested to trap ultra - cold atoms solely by quantum reflection in @xcite .",
    "the advantages of quantum reflection over other trapping mechanisms are obvious : stability of the reflection behaviour in the threshold region , no need for external auxiliary fields to form the trapping potential , because atom - surface interaction is delivered by nature free house . in @xcite we have shown , that the surviving particle density inside the trap as a function of time gives reasonable good results to be promising for future investigation .",
    "we have shown , that due to atom - surface interaction , an enhancement of the surviving particle density up to 50% is achievable .",
    "the trapping times lie somewhat around 0.5 s , excluding mass factors of the atomic species used .",
    "the model we proposed in @xcite relies solely on the threshold properties of an atom - surface potential .",
    "the trapping mechanism , quantum reflection , exploits the fact that cold atoms are reflected by an attractive potential tail without reaching a classical turning point .",
    "the mechanism of quantum reflection has enjoyed a growing interest , experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "the equivalence between the true atom - surface potential and the step - potential at threshold comes from the fact , that both obey the same law of reflectivity , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "very recently , madronero and friedrich , @xcite , have shown that the dynamics of a wave - packet governed by a step - potential is indeed qualitatively similar to the dynamics of a wave - packet governed by a power - law atom - surface potential .",
    "quantitatively , the differences are negligibly small and , as a matter of fact , the step - potential model even underestimates the results of the power - law potential . for quantum reflection",
    ", the use of a step - potential as a model for the atom - surface power - law potential has thus been justified once more .    here",
    ", we will examine the properties of a spherical quantum reflection trap , which is the simplest choice of a trapping system when particle interaction is included .",
    "to model our potential in this case , we make the following assumptions on the behaviour of the atom - surface potential inside a sphere : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the radius of the sphere .",
    "the assumptions eq . ( [ limittruepotential ] ) are certainly true if the radius of the sphere is , by orders of magnitude , larger than the extension of the atomic wave - packet inside the sphere .",
    "if this condition is fullfilled , the inside wall of the sphere , for an atom close to it , must locally look like a plane , @xcite . in good agreement with these requirements ,",
    "the atom - surface potential inside a sphere can be modeled as a step - potential @xmath2,\\quad b\\,=\\,\\beta_{4}\\quad .",
    "\\label{potentialmodel}\\ ] ]",
    "the system of interest is given by the gross - pitaevskii equation @xmath3 where the particle density is normalized to unity .",
    "the scale of the system is naturally given by the spatial extension of the trap , the radius @xmath1 of the sphere .",
    "the scaling variables are thus given by @xcite , @xmath4 the last term in eq .",
    "( [ scalingvariables ] ) restores normalization to unity . the atom - surface potential eqs .",
    "( [ limittruepotential ] , [ potentialmodel ] ) shows only a dependence in the radial direction , so the angles can be separated off .",
    "assuming the system to be in an s - wave state , the scaled wave - function is @xmath5 with eq .",
    "( [ 3dimwavefunction ] ) , the angular parts can easily be integrated out which yields for the interaction energy @xmath6 the radial coupling - constant is then given by @xmath7    the radial gross - pitaevskii equation describing our quantum reflection trap in scaled form thus finally reads @xmath8\\,\\psi(x,\\tau)\\,+\\,\\gamma\\frac{\\left|\\psi(x,\\tau)\\right|^2}{x^{2}}\\,\\psi(x,\\tau)\\quad .",
    "\\label{gp}\\ ] ] to simplify our notation , we have dropped the subscript of the radial wave - function and the interaction - strength @xmath9 .",
    "the step function on the right hand side in eq .",
    "( [ gp ] ) is again the model of the atom - surface interaction .    in table",
    "( [ couplingconstants ] ) we have listed some values of the radial coupling constant for the alkali atoms typically used in bec experiments .",
    ".comparison of the scaled potential strength @xmath10 and the coupling - constant @xmath9 for some alkali atoms .",
    "the radial extension of the trap is allover @xmath11[a.u . ] .",
    "the potential data was taken from @xcite , the data for the scattering lengths were taken from @xcite for li , from @xcite for na , and form @xcite for rb . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the values of table ( [ valuessigma40 ] ) show that the surviving particle fractions @xmath12 can achieve a strong enhancement when the particle - interaction strength @xmath9 lies in the regime of @xmath13 .",
    "compared to the case of @xmath14 , the enhancement factor ranges from 1.6 to 2.0 , but compared to the freely decaying wave - packet , @xmath15 , @xcite , the trapping mechanism achieves enhancement factors from 42 for @xmath16 to 104 for @xmath17 .",
    "clearly , negative self - interaction , compared to the noninteracting case , significantly enhances the efficiency of the trap .",
    "figure ( [ energysigma40 ] ) illustrates the effect of trapping under self - interaction on the energies of the system as functions of time . at the beginning of the time - evolution ,",
    "the total energy of the system is negative , and the particle - interaction dominates the system .",
    "the process of stabilization of the wave - packet by the self - trapping effect establishes a state of dynamical equilibrium between the kinetic energy and the interaction energy .",
    "when the total energy of the system has become positive , the wave - packet is no more in danger to collapse and has entered the regime were the kinetic energy , together with the quantum reflection , govern the behaviour of the system .",
    "however , the kinetic energy of the wave - packet has been reduced by the stabilization process , rendering quantum reflection even more effective .",
    "together with figure ( [ dichtesigma40 ] ) the behaviour of the energy clearly explains the trapping in this regime .",
    "the dynamics of a wave - packet in the quantum reflection trap becomes unstable against collapse , when the interaction strength @xmath9 becomes smaller than the critical value @xmath18 .",
    "as the wave - packet evolves in time , the influence of the attractive particle - interaction grows strongly , leading to a strong localization of the wave - packet .",
    "strong localization goes along with high momenta , which lead to the destruction of the coherence of the wave - packet .",
    "when the wave - packet undergoes a complete disruption , it collapses .",
    "see the full curve in figure ( [ dichtesigma40gminus063 ] ) .",
    "the collapse goes along with a strong loss of particle density , that takes place during an extremely short interval of time . after the collapse of the wave - packet the attractive self - interaction",
    "is also destroyed and the effect of quantum reflection again dominates the behaviour of the system .",
    "the effect of quantum reflection manifests itself by stopping the evaporation and forcing the wave - packet to reshape .",
    "thus , the remaining but strongly reduced density in the trap decays regularly as the system continues to evolve in time .",
    "figure ( [ energysigma40gminus063 ] ) shows the behaviour of both energies . to help the readers eyes in separating the critical peaks of both energies , we have drawn two vertical lines .",
    "it can be clearly seen how the negative interaction energy grows to strong negative values during the time - evolution of the system .",
    "the kinetic energy , on the positive half of the ordinate also grows during collapse in the attempt to achieve a dynamical equilibrium that stabilizes the system .",
    "however , by this peak in the kinetic energy the mechanism of quantum reflection becomes meaningless and a large fraction of particle density simply evaporates .",
    "even after its peak the kinetic energy of the system is large enough to continuously drive a considerable fraction of particle density to the outside , such that the system experiences a self - cooling and the kinetic energy falls off again . when this has happened the effect of quantum reflection regains the control over the dynamics .",
    "note , that the particle - interaction , due to the strong loss of particle density , remains negligible .",
    "the stability of our quantum reflection trap can be accessed by variational techniques . a very elaborated and general variational approach to cold atom systems",
    "was given in @xcite , where the critical interaction - strength @xmath19 for an anisotropic harmonically trapped 3d bec - system in the absence of a longitudinal confinement was determined to @xmath20 .",
    "the same problem is considered in @xcite numerically , where @xmath18 was found . for our system",
    ", we have found the same critical value @xmath18 , despite a longitudinal ( radial ) confinement due to the atom - surface potential .",
    "the difference can be explained by the fact that the atom - surface potential is confining with respect to quantum reflection , whereas a harmonic oscillator potential is confining due to classical reflection at the potential surface . when a longitudinal confinement is present in a harmonic oscillator system , the critical value is reduced to @xmath21 , @xcite .",
    "the absence of a ( classical ) longitudinal confinement due to a potential surface , along with the presence of a quantum confinement provided by atom - surface potentials thus enables the storage of a higher number of atoms for attractive particle - interaction on macroscopic time - scales .    to analyze the stability of our system",
    ", we will refer to a much simpler variational technique than the one suggested in @xcite , see e.g. @xcite , where the authors restrict themselves to a simple gaussian trial - function .",
    "our choice for a radial trial - function defined on the whole space is @xmath22\\quad , \\label{gausstrial}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the normalization and @xmath24 is the width . with eq .",
    "( [ gausstrial ] ) we obtain a parametrized energy @xmath25\\,-\\,\\alpha\\,{\\rm{erfc}}\\left[\\alpha^{-1}\\right]\\right)\\,+\\,\\gamma\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi\\,\\alpha^{6}}}\\quad . \\label{paramenergy}\\ ] ] with eq .",
    "( [ paramenergy ] ) we can estabilish a relation between the particle - interaction @xmath9 and the width of the gaussian state @xmath24 by demanding that the variation of @xmath26 with respect to @xmath24 vanishes , @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ variationh ] ) we have kept @xmath10 as a parameter . solving eq .",
    "( [ variationh ] ) for @xmath28 leads to @xmath29\\,+\\ , \\alpha^{2}\\,\\sigma^{2}\\,\\left(1\\,-\\,{\\rm{erf}}\\left[\\alpha^{-1}\\right]\\right)\\,-\\,\\frac{3}{2}\\,\\sqrt{\\pi}\\right]\\quad .",
    "\\label{runningcoupling}\\ ] ] equation ( [ runningcoupling ] ) defines a running coupling constant as a function of the initial width @xmath24 of the wave - packet and the strength of the atom - surface potential @xmath10 .",
    "the coupling constant depends implicitly on the initial kinetic energy of the wave - packet , which , as we have seen above , is crucial for the efficiency of the trapping mechanism . with @xmath30 in eq.([initialwavepacket ] ) we obtain @xmath31 for eq .",
    "( [ gausstrial ] ) .    from eq .",
    "( [ runningcoupling ] ) , we obtain the phase - diagram of the quantum reflection trap . from the phase - diagram ,",
    "( [ runningcouplingplot ] ) , which we have drawn for all values of @xmath10 considered above , the regions of stability can be read off easily and the value @xmath18 emerges as universal property of the quantum reflection trap .",
    "the horizontal and vertical lines mark our numerically determined value @xmath18 and our initial data @xmath30 , respectively .    as can be read off from figure ( [ runningcouplingplot ] ) , the simple gaussian trial - function delivers a critical region close to the exact value , such that we expect only small corrections from the general method of @xcite .",
    "also , our initial choice for @xmath30 , which matches the experimental conditions due to @xcite is justified as optimal choice .",
    "the universal region of the system is located left from the vertical line denoting @xmath32 , where no diversification of @xmath9 due to the potential strength @xmath10 occurs . by increasing @xmath33 , which means reducing @xmath24 , the storage capacity of the system",
    "is reduced , because the critical value @xmath19 is not accessible anymore .",
    "vice versa the same occurs , because by decreasing @xmath33 , which means increasing @xmath24 , the region of universality is left and the stability of the system is only granted along the phase - lines described by the strength of the atom - surface potential @xmath10 , requiring a higher value for @xmath9 , which also reduces the storage capacity of the system for attractive particle - interaction .",
    "lastly , fig .",
    "( [ runningcouplingplot ] ) , together with our numerical results from above proves , that the system shows not much sensitivity to the shape of the initial state , which neccessarily includes some arbitrariness in theoretical considerartions .",
    "we have investigated the possibility of trapping cold atoms solely by the mechanism of quantum reflection .",
    "our investigations have been carried out with the simplest possible model of a quantum reflection trap , a sphere .",
    "typically the radius @xmath1 of such a trapping sphere is of the order @xmath34[a.u . ] .",
    "the quantum reflection is mainly controlled by the strength of the atom - surface potential @xmath35 .",
    "the larger @xmath10 , the better does quantum reflection work .",
    "the strength parameter @xmath10 can be controlled either by the spatial extension of the trap , @xmath1 , or by the atomic interaction parameter @xmath36 .",
    "small values of @xmath36 can be achieved , e.g. , by using dielectric instead of perfectly conducting surfaces , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "however , instead of controlling @xmath10 by surface - engineering , it may be much easier to control the value of @xmath9 by a feshbach - resonance .",
    "the inclusion of repulsive particle interaction , @xmath37 depletes the surviving particle density inside the trap in comparison to a system evolving without particle interaction .",
    "as long as the interaction strength @xmath9 is smaller than unity , the depletion of the surviving particle density due to the repulsive interaction can be compensated by increasing the atom - surface interaction strength @xmath10 , see table ( [ valuessigma20 ] ) .",
    "the best results for trapping atoms by quantum reflection are achieved , when the particle interaction is attractive .",
    "the system remains stable when @xmath9 lies in the range of @xmath38 .",
    "the critical value @xmath18 is a universal property of our quantum reflection trap .",
    "this value of @xmath19 makes clear that cold atom systems confined by an atom - surface potential belong to a wider class of systems with classical longitudinal freedom .",
    "classical means , that no confinement due to a potential surface is present .",
    "the mechanism of quantum reflection acting in the case of atom - surface potentials establishes a quantum confinement .",
    "the quantum confinement has the advantage that more particles can be stored as in the case of a classical confinement , where the critical value is @xmath21 .",
    "approaching the critical value @xmath19 from above , the typical plateau structure of @xmath39 is washed out into slowly varying density oscillations , see fig .",
    "( [ dichtesigma40 ] ) .",
    "close to the criticality , this behaviour is reminiscent of the well - known phenomenon of the critical slowing down near the point of a phase - transition .",
    "critical slowing down goes along with the existence of long - ranged fluctuations of the systems internal modes .",
    "it may be these long - ranged fluctuations that stabilize the wave - packet against the influence of the attractive self - interaction above @xmath19 .    for attractive particle - interactions",
    "@xmath40 , the internal motion of the wave - packet is not capable to stabilize the sytem . as the system evolves in time",
    "the wave - packet suffers a collapse .",
    "the collapse heats up the system because the interaction - energy is almost completely transformed into kinetic energy ; along with the heating up , the system experiences a sudden loss of large fractions of particle density .",
    "our results clearly show , that the mechanism of quantum reflection remains a promising tool to trap cold atoms when particle interaction is included and tuned .",
    "however , as our variational analysis has revealed , the parameters of the system can not be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "for best results , they must allow the system to evlove in the universal region close to @xmath19 .    for alkali atoms ,",
    "there are realistic surviving particle densities up to 50 % for times around half a second . from table ( [ couplingconstants ] ) , the most promising candidate for trapping should be lithium , where the particle - interaction strength is already attractive .",
