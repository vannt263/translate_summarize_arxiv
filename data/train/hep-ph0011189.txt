    "this triggers the theory , which follows with a variety of models , usually completely different ( if not contradictory ) but each claiming good agreement with these data .",
    "the models provide therefore apparently different views of the same physical reality ( data ) leading to confusion on what is actually going on .",
    "it happens this way because experimental data contain only _ limited amount of information _ to which theoretical models add their own specific assumptions born not in data but in our minds .",
    "to quantify this situation one must find the way to answer ( in a model independent way ) the following question : given physical assumptions of a model ( plus phase space and conservation laws ) , what are their _ most trivial _ consequences ?",
    "this can be done only be by resorting to information theory which defines _ triviality _ as the _ lack of information _ ( the less information the more trivial ) .",
    "the measure of information provided by shannon entropy ( or some other kind of entropy , in our talk this will be tsallis entropy @xcite ) allows us then to quantify the whole problem .",
    "let us elaborate this point a bit further .",
    "experiment gives us usually set of points to which one tries to fit some distribution function @xmath4 , which can be thought to be some probability distribution . in this case shannon entropy corresponding to it is @xmath5 .",
    "\\label{eq : shannon}\\ ] ] we are looking for the most trivial @xmath4 , i.e. , for one containing the least information , and it means for such , which informational entropy is maximal under given circumstances ( constraints ) ) assumes that @xmath4 is measured against some other distribution @xmath6 corresponding to equal _ a priori _ probability being assigned to equal volumes of phase space .",
    "this is sometimes called `` the first principle of statistical mechanics '' @xcite . the boltzmann constant , which normally appears in ( [ eq : shannon ] ) has been henceforth assumed unity , @xmath7 . ] .",
    "what are those constraints ?",
    "at first , being a probability distribution @xmath4 must be non - negative and normalized , i.e. , @xmath8 further , @xmath4 has to reproduce the experimental results given in the form of expectation values @xmath9 of measured set of observables",
    "@xmath10 , i.e. , @xmath11 using eqs.([eq : norm ] ) and ( [ eq : r ] ) as constraints one then maximalizes information entropy ( [ eq : shannon ] ) and as results one gets the seek for distribution @xmath4 , @xmath12 ,   \\label{eq : findis}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is calculated from the normalization condition .",
    "this distribution reproduces known information ( i.e. , it tells us _ the truth , the whole truth _ about experiment ) and contains the least information ( i.e. , it tells us _ nothing but the truth _ ) . in this sense",
    "it is the unique , most plausible ( least biased ) , model independent probability distribution describing the outcomes of our experiment .",
    "the lagrange multipliers @xmath14 are given as solutions of the constraint equations and @xmath15 .",
    "+ now we can understand why apparently completely disparate models can describe sucessfully the same experiment .",
    "it is because they share ( usually in an implicite than explicite way ) the same set of basic common assumptions ( i.e. , constraints @xmath16 ) and , at the same time , they differ completely in the rest of them , i.e. , in those @xmath16 , which contain assumptions particular for a given model ( and which are completely not relevant to its agreement with experiment ) cut - off ) and that not the whole initial energy @xmath17 of reaction is used for the particle production ( i.e. , the existence of the inelasticity @xmath1 or of the leading particle effect ) . ] .",
    "+ this example tells us that statistical approach is not necessarily connected with any thermodynamical model but has , in fact , much broader range of applications . in our example above the formula ( [ eq : findis ] ) is identical with formulas used in thermal models @xcite but parameters @xmath14 can take any values depending on the energy and multiplicity of the event under considerations @xcite .",
    "it is worth to remind at this point the very old observation @xcite that exponential form ( [ eq : findis ] ) of so many distributions observed experimentally can have its origin in the fact that the actual measurements extend only to subsystems of a total system .",
    "the summation over the unmeasured ( i.e. , essentially overaged over ) degrees of freedom introduces the randomnization , which can be most economically described as a kind of thermal bath leading to thermal - like exponential distributions with some effective `` temperature ' ' @xmath18 .",
    "+ in this approach dynamics lies in our ability to reproduce the known information ( i.e. , is hidden in @xmath14 ) .",
    "however , the big advantage of this method is that it prevents us from smuggling in anything additional , not being present in data .",
    "the outcome depends on the funtional form of the entropy .",
    "the shannon form ( [ eq : shannon ] ) is the most popular one because it coincides in thermodynamical limit with the boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) form allowing for contact with standard thermodynamics .",
    "however , as newtonian mechanics is not eternal and universal ( in the sense that in the limit of large velocities it must be replaced by special relativity , in the limit of vanishingly small masses quantum mechanical effects must be accounted for and in the limit of extremaly large masses ( stars , galaxies , ... ) it must be replaced by general relativity ) the same can be said about the classical bg statistical mechanics .",
    "it is fully satisfactory only if    * effective microscopic interactions are short - ranged ( i.e. , we have close spacial connections ) ; * effective microscopic memory is short - ranged ( i.e , we have close time connections ) ; * boundary conditions are non ( multi)fractal ( i.e. , the relevant space - time and/or phase space is non ( multi)fractal ) .    as a matter of fact despite the popularity of bg it seems that in majority of situations we are dealing with , at least one of these conditions is not satisfied .",
    "therefore it is justified to look for the possible generalization of bg which would provide a compactifications of all possible deviations from the ideal bg statistics into a minimal - possible only one - additional parameters . in this way",
    "we arrive at the notion of tsallis statistics based on tsallis entropy @xcite : @xmath19 we shall not dwell too much on it here as this is the subject of separate lecture by prof .",
    "tsallis himself @xcite .",
    "the only points we would like to stress here for our purposes are :    * for @xmath20 one recovers the usual shannon entropy form of ( [ eq : shannon ] ) ; * with the normalization condition imposed on @xmath4 as before and with the new definition of the mean values , @xmath21 , one replaces formula ( [ eq : findis ] ) with @xmath22^{\\frac{1}{1-q } } ; \\label{eq : findisq}\\ ] ] ( notice that , again , for @xmath23 ( [ eq : findisq ] ) goes to ( [ eq : findis ] ) . as before",

    "although the nonextensive statistics were used for a long time in many branches of physics @xcite , their possible imprints in multiparticle production are very fresh . in this talk",

    "* discussion * + question by k.werner : _ concerning your example @xmath46 : this seems to be quite under control , large @xmath57 is perturbative qcd ( power - like ) , small @xmath135 is soft , so you have a superposition of these two processes .",
    "there seems to be no need of these additional fluctuations . _",
    "+ answer : your proposition is just one of many around us .",
    "you are right that adding two known ( in their domain of applicability ) mechanisms will also fit data .",
    "but what we are saying here is that , perhaps , there is mechanism which would show itself in the intermediate region and which can be described by the nonextensive parameter @xmath24 .",
    "and it can be experimentally checked in event - by - event type of analysis , as was presented above .",
    "this would answer the question is there a need for something or not .",
    "besides , it should be stressed that using only one new parameter @xmath24 one can fit quite large ( in @xcite the whole ) region of @xmath57 .",
    "+ question by f.grassi : _ did you try to fit @xmath57 distributions for other type of particles than charged ? _ + answer : no , at least not yet .",
    "+ question by t.kodama : _ if @xmath24 represents the measure of fluctuations of ensemble , then it would also reflect in multiplicity distributions . however , value of @xmath24 is different for the @xmath57 distribution and multiplicity distribution .",
    "how do you interpret this ? _ + answer : it is difficult for me to comment because so far i have not seen such analysis of the multiplicity data .",
    "but if things are really as you say then , assuming that everything was done correctly , i would argue that multiplicity is global characteristic whereas @xmath57 is a local one .",
    "therefore they are sensitive to different aspects of the underlying dynamics and resulting parameters @xmath24 could _ a priori _ be different .",
    "one can also say that for @xmath57 distribution the situation is more clear as we are simple replacing here @xmath136 by @xmath137 .",
    "multiplicity distributions depend on @xmath24 in indirect way only ."
