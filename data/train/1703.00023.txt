    "a black hole ( bh ) forms when no other force can uphold gravity and everything collapses down to a point of roughly planck size @xmath4 .",
    "the prediction of einstein s general relativity is that the point mass must be enclosed inside an event horizon , through which matter , energy and light can enter from outside , but nothing can exit . for a non - spinning bh ,",
    "the size of the event horizon , or the schwarzschild radius , is proportional to the mass @xmath5 as @xmath6 over the past 30 years , bh candidates have been found and classified according to their masses , with stellar - mass candidates having a few up to tens of @xmath7 and supermassive candidates with masses @xmath8-@xmath9 .",
    "proving the existence of the defining characteristic of bhs  the event horizon  would provide crucial support for einstein s general relativity .",
    "however , bh event horizons are usually too small for our telescopes to resolve .",
    "nearly all galaxies have a central massive object ( cmo ) of mass @xmath8-@xmath9 .",
    "the nature of the cmos is important in many astrophysical fields , e.g. active galactic nuclei , galaxy evolution , gravitational wave , etc .",
    "cmos are widely _ believed _ to be bhs , due to the following reasons ( many of which have been discussed by * ? ? ?",
    "\\(1 ) if the mass of a compact object exceeds the maximum neutron star mass @xmath10 , there is no known force that can hold it up from collapsing .",
    "( 2 ) since active galactic nuclei are powered by accretion ( or gravitational potential energy ) , the central mass - gaining object or cluster is expected to undergo collapse and eventually turn into a bh , if there is no exotic force supporting gravity .",
    "( 3 ) in the absence of an event horizon , the kinetic energy of the infalling gas will be converted into radiation inside or on the surface of the cmo .",
    "for the two nearby cmos at the centers of the milky way and m87 ( sgr a * and m87 * ) , if they do not have event horizons and are in thermal dynamic equilibrium , this amount of radiation ( @xmath11 ) overproduces the observed infrared flux by a factor of 10100 @xcite .",
    "( 4 ) the event horizon telescope ( eht ) images of sgr a * and m87 * in the millimeter wavelength so far are consistent with a point source of radius @xmath12-@xmath13 @xcite , which roughly corresponds to the apparent size of the photon capture radius ( `` bh shadow '' ) , so a hard surface at radius significantly larger than @xmath14 has been ruled out @xcite .",
    "as the sensitivity and resolution of eht improve , future images will be compared to realistic accretion flow models and will directly test the spacetime metric .",
    "( 5 ) the ligo detections of gravitational wave bursts ( e.g. gw150914 ) are consistent with merging stellar - mass bhs @xcite .",
    "while the reasons above are certainly strong , one may argue : reason ( 1 ) may not apply to cmos because their compactness is unknown and there might be some mechanism / material that can support them from collapsing ; reason ( 2 ) does not rule out many classes of bh alternative models either ( e.g. boson stars and gravastars , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; reasons ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) apply to only a few nearby cmos ( due to our telescopes finite resolution ) .",
    "as for reason ( 5 ) , gravitational wave generation calculations for binary merger events for alternative models of bhs ( objects without event horizon ) have only been done in the ringdown phase where the differences only appear in the late - time secondary pulses in the high - compactness limit ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . future work on the gravitational wave emission during the plunge and merger phase , combined with higher signal - to - noise ratio ligo detections , will put better constraints on the alternative models .    in this paper , we propose a novel observation that places stringent constraints on the possible location of a hard surface around cmos and hence strongly argues for them being bhs with event horizons .",
    "stars can be driven into nearly radial orbits towards the cmo by different processes , e.g. two - body relaxation , resonant relaxation , massive perturbers , non - spherical potential @xcite .",
    "if the cmo is compact enough , stars could reach down to a critical radius where the tidal gravity exceeds the star s self - gravity , causing a tidal disruption event ( tde ) .",
    "the newtonian tidal disruption radius is given by ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath15 where the star s mass and radius are expressed in units of solar mass and solar radius , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "when @xmath18 , the newtonian tidal disruption radius is not applicable and a full general relativistic treatment is necessary ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "when the star crosses @xmath19 , the tidal gravity of the cmo causes a spread of specific orbital energy across the star , which leaves roughly half of the star in bound orbits and the other half unbound . then the fall - back gas forms a thick accretion disk which produces months - long optical / uv luminosity @xmath20-@xmath21 observable at cosmological distances . recently",
    ", a few dozen of such tde candidates have been observed from various surveys carried out in the optical , uv and soft x - ray wavelengths , giving a tde rate of @xmath22 , consistent with but somewhat lower than theoretical estimates ( see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "the star in a tde can be used as a test particle to probe the nature of the cmo , because it reaches very close to @xmath23 . in this paper , we consider the observational consequences of star - cmo close encounters if the cmo does not possess an event horizon .",
    "we assume the cmo s radius to be @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a free parameter .",
    "if the cmo has a hard surface , then @xmath26 is the surface radius ; if the cmo is a diffuse cluster of non - luminous particles or objects , then @xmath26 is defined as the half - mass radius and @xmath27 is the mass enclosed within radius @xmath26 .",
    "there are two possibilities in the hard - surface scenario ( and both are considered in this paper ) : if the cmo is made of ordinary matter , the buchdahl limit gives @xmath28 @xcite ; if exotic forces are allowed , @xmath29 can be extremely close to 1 .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) , we know that tdes with accretion disk formation are only possible if the radius of the cmo is smaller than @xmath19 , i.e. @xmath30 therefore , considering the fact that tdes from cmos of roughly @xmath31 have been observed , we obtain an upper limit @xmath32 . the nature of cmos should not depend on their masses , so we only consider the parameter space @xmath33 . the upper limit on @xmath29 can rule out cmos being clusters of brown dwarfs or stellar remnants ( white dwarfs , neutron stars and stellar - mass bhs ) , because the lifetime due to collisions or evaporation is much shorter than @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "other alternative models can not be ruled out yet , such as objects with a hard surface supported by exotic forces ( e.g. gravastars , * ? ? ? * ) or the configuration from collapse of self - interacting scalar fields ( boson stars , see the review by * ? ? ? * ) or clusters of very low mass bhs ( @xmath35 if we use the newtonian evaporation rate of * ? ? ?",
    "in the absence of an event horizon , when a tde occurs , the kinetic energy of the baryons accreted onto the cmo is converted to thermal energy which should be radiated away over a certain period of time .",
    "regardless of the nature of the cmo , the accreted gas will be shocked when colliding with itself or the possible hard surface .",
    "then the shocked gas will form a hot envelope surrounding the cmo . as far as we know from baryonic physics , the layer of stellar debris",
    "must be supported by radiation pressure .",
    "one could infer the ( non-)existence of this radiating stellar debris layer by multi - wavelength observations of tdes . disproving",
    "the existence of such emission supports the existence of an event horizon .",
    "however , there are three obstacles one is faced with : ( 1 ) the amount of mass that is accreted onto the cmo is uncertain , because a fraction of the fall - back material could be blown away from the disk by a radiation driven wind ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) ; ( 2 ) as we will show in section [ sec : envelope ] , for relatively low - mass cmos ( @xmath36 ) , the emission from the stellar debris is mostly in the far uv where either our telescopes are currently not sensitive enough or absorption along the line of sight is strong ( for photons with energy @xmath37 ) ; ( 3 ) it is non - trivial to distinguish the emission from the stellar debris from that of the accretion disk .",
    "however , if we consider cmos more massive than @xmath38 , main sequence stars have to get closer than the innermost stable circular orbit in order to get tidally disrupted .",
    "in such cases , the geodesics in the schwarzschild spacetime are plunging ( or bound ) , so we expect only a small fraction of the disrupted star to be blown away and the majority to fall onto the cmo . on the other hand , when the cmo s mass is so large that its radius is larger than @xmath19 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) , classical tdes do not happen and there is no disk formation ( though the star may be disrupted by relativistic tidal forces if it gets very close to @xmath23 ) .",
    "there are then two possibilities : ( 1 ) if the cmo has a hard surface , the stellar gas is shocked when colliding with the surface and the shocked gas forms a hot radiation - dominated envelope ; ( 2 ) if the cmo is a diffuse cluster of particles or very low mass bhs , after entering the cmo , the star ( if not tidally disrupted ) experiences a drag due to dynamical friction or collisions with the particles .",
    "unfortunately , the drag may be too small to affect the stellar orbit because the particles could be weakly interacting with a very small collisional cross section .",
    "for instance , very low mass bhs penetrate through the star at high speed without producing much friction .",
    "there may not be any observational consequence in the second scenario .",
    "therefore , we only consider the first scenario , namely , the cmo has a hard surface ; some of the observational constrains we discuss should also apply to the situation where the star is tidally disrupted inside the cmo if it is dense enough or consists of massive compact objects that are capable of causing disruption .    in this paper , we consider cmos heavier than @xmath38 with a hypothetical hard surface at radius @xmath39 ( eq .  [ eq:9 ] ) , with @xmath40 .",
    "we assume cmos to be non - rotating ( or spin parameter @xmath41 ) , so the spacetime outside the surface is approximately spherically symmetric . when the star s orbit has pericenter distance smaller than max(@xmath42 ) , it is destroyed due to either tidal disruption or collision with the surface , which we call _ stellar disruption events _ in general .",
    "note that a parabolic orbit with pericenter distance smaller than @xmath43 means specific angular momentum less than @xmath44 , so the geodesic in a schwarzschild metric is plunging . in a stellar disruption event , the stellar gas gets shocked and then forms a quasistatic envelope supported by radiation pressure above the surface . in section [ sec : envelope ] , we show that the radiation from the stellar debris is bright at optical / uv wavelengths and could be detected as unique and long - lasting transients . in section [ sec : rate ]",
    ", we show that , given the estimated rate of such stellar disruption events , non - detection of such transients by current optical surveys has already ruled out a hard surface with @xmath45 .",
    "in this subsection , we use geometrized units @xmath46 . consider a horizonless object of mass @xmath27 with a hard surface at @xmath26 larger than @xmath47 .",
    "the compactness of the object is characterized by @xmath48 in this subsection we assume @xmath49 , so we have @xmath50 when a star of mass @xmath51 falls onto this object from infinity , gas particles move radially inward with lorentz factor @xmath52 in the local frame before being shocked at the surface . therefore , the shocked gas is highly relativistic with equation of state ( eos ) @xmath53 ( @xmath54 is pressure and @xmath55 is energy density in the fluid rest frame ) . note that here both pressure and energy density are dominated by radiation .",
    "we assume the system to be spherically symmetric .",
    "when the system reaches hydrostatic equilibrium , as long as the matter - radiation mixture can be considered as a tightly coupled single fluid system with an isotropic pressure tensor ( see appendix a for more details ) , the pressure profile of the shocked gas on the object s surface is described by the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the total mass within radius @xmath58 . for @xmath59 and @xmath60",

    "however , the existing data does not rule out the possibility that a small fraction of cmo might have @xmath297 . in the future lsst era , with a much more accurate determination of the rate of stellar disruptions by cmos , one should be able to place a much stronger limit on @xmath281 without making the assumption that all cmos have the same @xmath29 .",
    "\\(2 ) we have ignored the spin of cmos , which will modify the shape of the hard surface and spacetime above the surface ( and hence the emergent radiation from the stellar debris ) .",
    "note that the scale height of the layer of stellar debris is a factor of a few smaller than @xmath129 in the non - spinning case . and",
    "as long as the spin is relatively slow ( spin parameter @xmath298 ) , most of the baryonic mass is within the light cylinder and the structure of the stellar debris layer is not strongly affected by rotation .",
    "the emission from the photosphere is still determined by the fraction of the diffusive flux escaping to infinity , so observations can rule out a similar range of @xmath29 as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : ndet ] ) and the conclusion will be similar for cmos with @xmath299 .",
    "\\(3 ) the situation close to the photosphere in the strong - gravity regime is complicated : ( i ) the radiation field is highly anisotropic ; ( ii ) baryons and radiation can not be treated as a single fluid ; ( iii ) the system is not adiabatic due to energy flowing in from below and out from above ; ( iv ) there might be large - scale convective motion or wind may be lost in a wind and the mass loss rate @xmath300 , where @xmath301 is the diffusion time of the entire baryonic layer measured at infinity ( eq . [ eq:30 ] ) . if the wind speed is on the order of the local escape velocity , it can be shown that the thomson scattering optical depth of the wind is @xmath302 , which is @xmath128 in the strong gravity regime . ] .",
    "one caveat of this paper is that the lightcurve of the transient emission is likely not flat .",
    "the hydrodynamics of the collision between the star and the hard surface can affect the initial lightcurve on a timescale of a few times @xmath303 or possibly as large as @xmath304 ( when @xmath305 ) . then , since the flux of photons escaping to infinity is smaller than the diffusive flux arriving at the photosphere from deeper layers , the radiation pressure at the photosphere rises with time causing a larger escaping flux and also pushing the photosphere to slightly larger radii . on a timescale longer than the photon diffusion time through the entire layer ( see eq .",
    "[ eq:30 ] ) , the photosphere slowly shrinks and the escaping flux decreases with time until the radiation energy content is depleted . solving the full radiation - hydrodynamical structure of the stellar debris layer from optically thick to thin regions is left for future work .",
    "we discuss in appendix a the validity and limitations of the tov equation for describing the structure of the stellar debris layer .",
    "\\(4 ) we were unable to provide a strong constraint on @xmath29 for cmos of mass @xmath306 , due to the following two reasons : ( i ) the emission from the layer of stellar debris on the possible hard surface may peak in the non - observable far uv ( if @xmath307 ) ; ( ii ) main - sequence stars are tidally disrupted before reaching close to @xmath23 .",
    "the radiation produced ( e.g. by shocks and the accretion disk ) before the gas falls onto the cmo makes it very hard for observations to constrain the emission we have calculated in this work .",
    "the actual accretion rate onto the cmo is also uncertain due to the complexities of accretion disk physics .",
    "\\(5 ) we have assumed that baryons and radiation associated with the stellar debris are incorporated into the cmo s pre - existing exotic material ( the material that forms the hard surface with which the star collides ) on a timescale @xmath308 much longer than the duration of the transient radiation from stellar disruption , @xmath193 , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq:43 ] ) .",

    "\\(6 ) cmos are growing in mass @xmath27 and size @xmath26 due to gas accretion over cosmic time . to avoid the formation of an event horizon , the mass of the baryonic layer on the hard surface must not exceed @xmath310 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : p0 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the transformation of radiation - baryon mixture to exotic matter must occur on a timescale @xmath311 ( @xmath312 being the accretion rate ) .",
    "this assumption was implicitly made by broderick et al .",
    "when they considered the consequences of accretion onto a possible hard surface in sgr a * and m87 * ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , they assumed , based on an erroneous reasoning from the short dynamical time ( @xmath199 ) , that the system can be described to be in equilibrium such that the rate of radiation energy escaping to infinity is equal to the rate of mass - energy falling onto the hard surface , i.e. @xmath313 . however , we point out that the dynamical time being short only means that the baryonic layer on the hard surface is in hydrostatic equilibrium , but it does not imply a balance between the rate of in - falling and escaping energy .",
    "the luminosity at infinity is equal to the accretion rate when the timescale for radiation to escape from the hard surface is shorter than the timescale over which the accretion rate is roughly constant . for sgr a * , the accretion rate likely varies on timescales of @xmath314 .",
    "if the radiation from the accreted gas is released at radius @xmath58 where @xmath315 , then only a small fraction @xmath201 of the radiation escapes and the rest follows a highly curved trajectory that brings it back to the hard surface .",
