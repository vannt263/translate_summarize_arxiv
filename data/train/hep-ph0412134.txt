    "it is well known that besides the main decay mode of a free neutron in vacuum @xmath10 there is also the neutron decay into a bound @xmath0 state ( hydrogen atom ) and an antineutrino @xmath11 several theoretical estimates for the rate of the latter process have been performed ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "regardless of the framework employed for the description of the hydrogen atom ( for example , such as the schrdinger equation  @xcite , dirac theory  @xcite or relativistic bethe - salpeter formalism  @xcite ) all the treatments yield the following estimate for the ratio of bound - state and continuum - state decay rates : @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , in general one might expect the effect of the neutron bound - state decay  ( [ beta_decay_bound ] ) to be subdominant if compared with the continuum - state decay  ( [ beta_decay_free ] ) .",
    "however , as shown below this conclusion does not hold true in the situation where a neutron decays in the presence of a strong magnetic field .    in this work",
    "we estimate the ratio @xmath8 in the presence of a magnetic field with strength @xmath1  g. our study is motivated by a widely accepted view that in diverse astrophysical and cosmological environments the physics of neutrinos in strong magnetic fields plays an important role .",
    "the existence of very strong magnetic fields in proto - neutron stars and pulsars is well established .",
    "the surface magnetic fields of many supernovae and neutron stars are of the order of @xmath13  g  @xcite .",
    "the surface magnetic fields of magnetars are perhaps as large as @xmath14  g  @xcite .",
    "very strong magnetic fields are also supposed to have existed in the early universe ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) .    the effect of a constant magnetic field on the process  ( [ beta_decay_free ] ) is well documented . in short ,",
    "the constant magnetic field affects the motion of a charged particle in such a way that the energy associated with the transverse motion ( with respect to the field direction ) is quantized into landau levels while the longitudinal motion remains free .",
    "the larger the field intensity @xmath9 , the larger the energy separating the landau levels .",
    "thus , the decay rate @xmath5 exhibits the following dependence on the field intensity @xmath9 . for @xmath15 , where @xmath16  g with @xmath17 being the nucleon mass defect ( hereafter we use the units @xmath18 ) , the effect of a magnetic field on both an electron and a proton is small and @xmath5 remains practically insensitive to @xmath9 . as the field intensity approaches the value @xmath19 ( note that @xmath20 , where @xmath21  g is the so - called schwinger field ) the effect of landau quantization on the transverse electron motion becomes considerable @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath23 , where @xmath24/2e=1.25\\times10^{17}$ ]  g , the electron ( due to the energy conservation law ) can occupy only the lowest landau level , and it was shown in  @xcite that the decay rate grows as @xmath25 . in the case of a superstrong magnetic field ( @xmath26 )",
    "the proton can occupy only the lowest landau level and one has again a monotonic dependence @xmath25",
    "@xcite . finally , as the field strength exceeds the value @xmath27  g the modification of the strong forces , which bind the quarks in nucleons , is such that it can close the mass gap between the neutron and proton making the neutron stable  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) . in what follows",
    "we concentrate on field strengths in the range @xmath28 , where @xmath29  g is the schwinger field for the proton .    to our knowledge ,",
    "no theoretical analysis has been published for the process  ( [ beta_decay_bound ] ) in a ( strong ) magnetic field .",
    "it should be noted that such study is hampered by the fact that in calculating the decay rate @xmath4 one must know the eigenenergies and eigenstates of the hydrogen atom in an external magnetic field . in the case of a strong field",
    "the latter problem has been studied in a number of papers , where numerical and semianalytical results have been derived within different approaches based on the schrdinger  @xcite , dirac  @xcite , and breit  @xcite equations .",
    "a common result of all the treatments is that , compared to the field - free case , the ground state of the hydrogen atom is ( 1 ) very tightly bound and ( 2 ) well separated in energy from excited states .",
    "the shape of the atom is also affected by the field .",
    "the transverse atomic size is approximately determined by the magnetic length @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the bohr radius , and the longitudinal atomic size @xmath32 depends on the binding atomic energy . in particular , in the case @xmath33",
    "one has for the ground state a cigar - like shape with @xmath34 , while for the excited states @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that these remarkable effects of a strong magnetic field on the hydrogen atom are obtained assuming the absence of transverse motion of the atom as a whole .",
    "however , even at a moderate transverse atomic velocity a rather strong electric field is induced in the rest frame of the atom pushing the electron and the proton apart . as a result , the binding energy decreases as the transverse velocity increases .",
    "thus , in contrast to the field - free case , the center - of - mass atomic motion does not decouple from the relative internal motion , and therefore a correct description of the hydrogen atom in a strong magnetic field should involve the two - body approach  @xcite .    by analogy with the field - free case  @xcite , the ratio @xmath8 can be roughly estimated using a phase - space argument that does not depend on a formal theory of weak interactions . the phase - space volume available for the final products in the process  ( [ beta_decay_free ] ) can be presented by the function @xmath36 that depends on the field strength and nucleon mass defect . for the bound - state decay  ( [ beta_decay_bound ] ) ,",
    "the available phase - space volume is given by @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the neutrino s energy and @xmath39 is the ground - state wave function of a hydrogen atom evaluated at zero distance between an electron and a proton .",
    "the ratio of the bound - state and continuum - state decay rates is approximately equal to the ratio of the corresponding phase - space volumes @xmath40 for example , using the phase - space argument in the field - free case ( @xmath41 ) we get the result @xmath42 which is of the same order of magnitude as the accurate calculations of refs .  @xcite . in the case of a strong field ( @xmath23 )",
    "we have @xmath43 using the estimates for @xmath32 reported in  ref.@xcite , we might expect [ in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ estimate_phspace ] ) ] that @xmath44 this result is almost five orders of magnitude larger than in the field - free case  ( [ estimate_phspace_free ] ) and thus it calls for a more detailed and rigorous theoretical analysis , such as carried out below .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ gen_form ] a general formulation of the problem is given in the context of the standard quantum field theory employing a bethe - salpeter formalism .",
    "then , in sec",
    ".  [ wf ] , we discuss in detail a structure of the wave function of a bound @xmath0 state in a strong magnetic field .",
    "further , specific approximations to the bethe - salpeter equation are developed in the cases @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "[ estimate ] is devoted to the derivation of an estimate for the bound - state decay rate .",

    "we utilize this fact below , when estimating the ratio @xmath8 in the general case @xmath202 .",
    "a smooth dependence of @xmath5 on the field strength @xmath9  @xcite combined with the identity of the expressions  ( [ decay_rate_free ] ) and  ( [ decay_rate_free_1 ] ) allows us to extrapolate the obtained results for the ratio @xmath8 in the whole range of considered field strengths .",
    "specifically , we assume the expression  ( [ decay_rate_free ] ) [ ( [ decay_rate_free_1 ] ) ] obtained in the case @xmath23 ( @xmath46 ) to be valid for estimating the ratio @xmath8 in the general case @xmath28 , which incorporates the above particular ranges of field strengths .",
    "let us note that in the field - free case ( @xmath41 ) the relative contribution of excited states to the ratio @xmath8 [ see eq .",
    "( [ field_free ] ) ] is about 20%  @xcite .",
    "taking into account that , in contrast to the field - free situation , in the presence of a strong magnetic field the excited states are very weakly bound in comparison with the ground state , we neglect their contribution to the ratio @xmath8 .",
    "the ground - state wave function @xmath203 can be approximated as follows  @xcite @xmath204 where @xmath205 is the ground - state energy .",
    "thus we get ( @xmath206 ) @xmath207 in the field - free case the corresponding result is given by ( accounting only for the ground - state contribution ) @xmath208 where @xmath209 is the ground - state energy of the hydrogen atom .",

    "@xcite ) @xmath210 and ( 2 ) the recent formula from ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath211,\\ ] ] where @xmath212 .",
    "it is seen that both asymptotic formulas give the same order of magnitude for the ratio @xmath8 . in both cases the results exhibit a linear dependence on @xmath213 . however , the results obtained on a basis of eq .",
    "( [ ll ] ) are approximately two times larger in magnitude than those obtained on a basis of eq .",
    "( [ kp ] ) . due to the fact that the asymptotic formula  ( [ kp ] ) yields more accurate values for the ground - state energy @xmath205",
    "than the formula  ( [ ll ] ) does ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) , we can conclude that the estimate for the ratio @xmath8 using eq .",
    "( [ kp ] ) is more realistic .",
    "in summary , we have considered and analyzed theoretically the neutron decay into a bound @xmath0 state and an antineutrino in the presence of a magnetic field with strength @xmath1",
    "g. the amplitude of the bound - state decay process has been formulated within the framework of the standard model of weak interactions . for the description of the bound @xmath0 system we have employed the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "the approximations to the bethe - salpeter wave function of the bound @xmath0 state have been specified depending on the field strength @xmath9 .",
    "we have derived the bound - state decay rate @xmath4 in two particular cases , namely , @xmath23 and @xmath46 . in both cases ,",
    "the identical expressions for the ratio of bound - state and continuum - state decay rates @xmath8 have been obtained .",
    "we have estimated the ratio @xmath8 in the general case @xmath202 using two asymptotic formulas  @xcite for the ground - state energy of the hydrogen atom in a strong magnetic field .",
    "for both asymptotic formulas a logarithmic - like behaviour @xmath214 , where @xmath215 and @xmath216 are positive constants , has been determined .    the numerical estimate for the ratio of bound - state and continuum - state decay rates has been performed .",
    "it has been found that in contrast to the field - free case , where the bound - state decay mode is suppressed by a factor of about @xmath217  @xcite as compared with the usual ( continuum - state ) decay mode , in the presence of a strong magnetic field @xmath218 the ratio @xmath8 is of the order @xmath219 .",
    "this remarkable finding can be important for the physics of supernovae and neutron stars , where magnetic fields with strength @xmath1 g may exist . in particular , the high value of the neutron bound - state decay rate @xmath4 can influence the nucleon balance in protoneutron stars and the hydrogen fraction in the atmosphere of neutron stars and magnetars .",
    "the high value of @xmath4 can affect the neutrino spectra from astrophysical objects with strong magnetic fields , because in the neutron bound - state beta - decay process the energy distribution of antineutrino is peaked about @xmath220 .",
    "however , for estimating these possible astrophysical effects one should consider a more involved problem , namely , the bound - state beta - decay of a neutron moving in the presence of a strong magnetic field and dense matter ( for instance , such as a neutron star ) .",
    "this implies modifications of the photon , electron , and proton propagators in the bethe - salpeter equation  ( [ bethe - salpeter ] ) due to many - particle effects  @xcite .",
    "in addition , an electric field induced in the rest frame of a neutron ( due to its transverse motion in the matter rest frame ) should be accounted for , because for the transverse neutron velocities @xmath221 the induced electric fields are as strong as to pull the hydrogen atom apart .",
    "note , however , that in dense matter an electric field can be strongly screened by the surrounding medium .",
    "the screening also modifies the electron - proton interaction . in the context of the present analysis",
    "the latter factor becomes appreciable if @xmath222 , where @xmath223 is a screening length for the medium . since @xmath224 , where @xmath225 is a density of charged particles ( electrons or protons ) in matter , we obtain the following criterion @xmath226 ( or @xmath227 ) which indicates the situation where the role of screening can not be neglected ( such situation can be encountered , for example , in the interiors of a protoneutron star ) .",
    "let us remark that the high value of the bound - state decay rate @xmath4 can be also important for cosmological applications .",
    "if the controversial hypothesis of strong magnetic fields influencing the usual beta - decay process in the early universe  @xcite is realistic , then one has a right to expect that the neutron beta - decay into a bound state of the @xmath0 system might have substantial consequences for big - bang nucleosynthesis and the production of light elements in the early universe .",
    "note that in the terrestrial laboratory environment the strongest magnetic field that can be produced is of the order of @xmath228  g ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) which is much lower than @xmath229 .",
    "however , the results of our present analysis can be used even in the case of such fields if the neutron beta - decay takes place in semiconducting or dielectric media , where a small effective mass for the electron and a large dielectric constant reduce the coulomb force relative to the magnetic force  @xcite .",
    "finally , it is straightforward to generalize the results obtained in this work to the bound - state beta - decay of a nucleus with charge @xmath230 in a strong magnetic field .",
    "this is realized by replacing the nucleon mass defect @xmath231 with the corresponding value for the nucleus under consideration and taking into account that the atomic energy and radius are given by @xmath232 and @xmath233 , respectively .",
    "after performing such a procedure , it can be deduced from eqs .",
    "( [ decay_rate_free_2 ] ) ,  ( [ ll ] ) and/or  ( [ kp ] ) that @xmath234 $ ] , where the positive constants @xmath215 and @xmath216 do not depend on @xmath235 .",
    "thus , the dependence of the ratio @xmath8 on the nuclear charge is different from that in the absence of a magnetic field , in which case @xmath236 .",
