    "problem of dynamics in the perturbed keplerian potential has been studied extensively throughout the history of celestial mechanics . due to high attainable accuracy of observational data , its primary field of application",
    "has always been the solar system , which naturally influenced the selection of included perturbations .",
    "ones of those widely considered are , due to their resemblance with the averaged motion of planets , axisymmetric gravitational potentials .",
    "the above problem has , however , also been investigated for systems with larger length scales , such as dense star clusters . in that case , the source of the keplerian potential is often represented by a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) which is widely assumed to reside in the centres of such clusters .",
    "axisymmetric perturbation is then either due to a secondary massive black hole ( e.g. ivanov , polnarev & saha 2005 ) or a gaseous disc or torus ( e.g. karas & ubr 2007 ) .",
    "it turns out that in these systems , the secular evolution of individual stellar orbits is , beside the axisymmetric perturbation , also affected by a possible additional spherical potential .",
    "such a potential may be generated by a stellar cusp or it can represent a post - newtonian correction to the gravity of the central black hole .    in this paper , we extend the analyses of previous authors by means of standard tools of celestial mechanics .",
    "our main aim is to incorporate mutual interaction of stars on nearly - circular orbits around the dominating central mass whose potential is perturbed by a distant axisymmetric source and an extended spherical potential .",
    "we apply our results to the observed system of young stars @xcite orbiting the smbh of mass @xmath1 @xcite in the centre of the milky way . as an axisymmetric perturbation to its gravity we consider a massive molecular torus ( the so - called circumnuclear disc ; cnd ) which",
    "is located at radius @xmath2 from the centre @xcite .",
    "finally , we consider gravity of a roughly spherical cusp of late - type stars @xcite which is believed to be present in this region , as well . within this context , we broaden the analysis of our previous paper ( haas , ubr & kroupa 2011 ) where we have studied the dynamical evolution of this kind of system purely by means of numerical @xmath0-body calculations . in particular , we now develop a simple semi - analytic model which naturally explains key features of our prior results .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the theoretical section  [ sec : theory ] ,",
    "we first discuss the influence of the spherical perturbative potential upon the stellar orbits ( section  [ eccom ] ) .",
    "this allows us to separate the evolution of eccentricity from the rest of the problem and , subsequently , to formulate equations for the evolution of inclinations and nodal longitudes ( section  [ incom ] ) . in section  [ sec : sgra ] , we present an example of the orbital evolution of a stellar disc motivated by the configuration that is observed in the galactic centre .",
    "we conclude our results in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "to set the stage , we first develop a secular theory of orbital evolution for two ( later in the section generalized to multiple ) stars orbiting a massive centre , the smbh , taking into account their mutual gravitational interaction and perturbations from the spherical stellar cusp and the axisymmetric cnd .",
    "the cnd is considered stationary and its model is further simplified and taken equivalent to a ring at a certain distance from the centre .",
    "it should be , however , pointed out that generalization to a more realistic structure , such as thin or thick disc , is straightforward in our setting but we believe at this stage it would just involve algebraic complexity without bringing any new quality to the model . in the same way , the stellar cusp is reduced to an equilibrium spherical model without involving generalizations beyond that level .",
    "for instance , an axisymmetric component of the stellar cusp may be effectively accounted for by the cnd effects in the first approximation .",
    "we are going to use standard tools of classical celestial mechanics , based on the first - order secular solution using the perturbation methods ( see , e.g. , morbidelli 2002 or bertotti , farinella & vokrouhlick 2003 for general discussion ) .",
    "in particular , the stellar orbits are described using a conventional set of kepler s elements which are assumed to change according to lagrange equations . since we are interrested in a long - term dynamical evolution of the stellar orbits we replace the perturbing potential ( or potential energy ) with its average value over one revolution of the stars about the centre , which is the proper sense of addressing our approach as secular .",
    "in doing so , we assume there is no orbital mean motion resonance between the two ( or multiple ) stars . as an implication of our approach , the orbital semi - major axes of the stellar orbits are constant and information about the position of the stars in orbit is irrelevant .",
    "the secular system thus consists of description how the remaining four orbital elements , eccentricity , inclination , longitude of node and argument of pericentre , evolve in time .",
    "this is still a very complicated problem in principle , and we shall adopt simplifying assumption that will allow us to treat the eccentricities and pericentres separately ( section  [ eccom ] ) and leave us finally with the problem of dynamical evolution of inclinations and nodes ( section  [ incom ] ) . note this is where our approach diverges from typical applications in planetary systems , in which this separation is often impossible .      in this section",
    "we discuss our assumptions about eccentricity and pericentre evolution . for this moment",
    ", we drop the mutual interaction of stars from our consideration .",
    "we assume that the initial stellar orbits have small eccentricity and we describe under which conditions we may assume they stay small to the point we could neglect them .",
    "note this is not an obvious conclusion because axially symmetric systems ( such as a perturbing massive ring ) have been extensively studied in planetary applications and it has been shown that non - conservation of the total orbital angular momentum may lead to a large , correlated variations of eccentricity and inclination even if the initial eccentricity is arbitrarily small . this is often called kozai secular resonance as a tribute to a pioneering work of kozai ( 1962 ) ( see also lidov 1962 ) . in what follows",
    "we describe conditions under which this process is inhibited in our model .",
    "we start with our assumption about the potential energy of a star of mass @xmath3 in the spherical cusp of the late - type stars surrounding the centre . considering a general power - law radial density profile of the cusp , @xmath4",
    ", we have the potential energy @xmath5 where @xmath6 , the cusp mass within a scale distance @xmath7 is denoted @xmath8 and @xmath9 stands for the gravitational constant . according to the averaging technique",
    ", we shall integrate the potential energy ( [ bw2 ] ) over one revolution about the centre with respect to the mean anomaly @xmath10 , @xmath11 which yields @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are semi - major axis and eccentricity of the stellar orbit , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "after an easy algebra , we obtain @xmath17 where @xmath18 with the coefficients obtained by recurrence @xmath19 \\left[1-    \\frac{2+\\beta}{2(n+1)}\\right]&&\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and an initial value @xmath20 . for the purpose of our study , we further set @xmath21 which corresponds to the equilibrium model worked out by @xcite .      in the case of perturbation of orbits well below the radius of the cnd ,",
    "we limit ourselves to account for the quadrupole - tide formulation ( e.g. kozai 1962 ; morbidelli 2002 ) .",
    "octupole or higher - multipole corrections are possible ( e.g. in fact kozai himself gives explicit terms up to degree 4 ; see also yokoyama et  al .",
    "2003 ) but they do not change the conclusions as long as the parameter @xmath22 is small enough .",
    "this is the regime that interests us most .",
    "given the axial symmetry of the mass distribution of the perturbing ring , the resulting averaged interaction potential energy of a particle in the tidal field of the cnd ( see kozai 1962 ) @xmath23 \\label{koz1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] does not depend on longitude of node @xmath24 but depends on other orbital elements of the stellar orbit ",
    "eccentricity @xmath14 , inclination @xmath25 and argument of pericentre @xmath26 .     from equation  ( [ bwkoz ] ) for two different values of the mass ratio @xmath27 : 0.01 at the top panel , 0.1 at the bottom panel .",
    "the kozai integral value is @xmath28 , corresponding to @xmath29 inclination circular orbit .",
    "the orbit has been given semi - major axis @xmath30 for sake of definiteness .",
    "the origin @xmath31 is a stationary point of the problem but in the first case it is unstable , while in the second case it becomes stable .",
    "the thick isoline in the top panel is a separatrix between two different regimes of eccentricity and pericentre evolution . ]",
    "( abscissa ) for different values of orbital semi - major axis @xmath13 ranging from @xmath32 ( left ) to @xmath33 ( right ) with the step of @xmath32 .",
    "when @xmath34 , the critical angle is @xmath35 ( ` the kozai limit ' ) independently from @xmath13 . ]    as a direct consequence , @xmath36 is the first ( ` kozai ' ) integral of motion , which conveniently allows to eliminate inclination dependence in @xmath37 , depending then on the eccentricity and argument of pericentre only .",
    "since @xmath37 is a conserved quantity in the secular ( orbit - averaged ) problem , the isolines @xmath38 provide insights in the fundamental features of the dynamical evolution of both @xmath14 and @xmath26 .",
    "this approach has been used by kozai to discover two modes of topology of these isolines : ( i ) when @xmath39 the @xmath40 isolines are simple ovals about origin which is the only fixed point of the problem but ( ii ) for @xmath41 they become more complicated with a separatrix curve emerging from the origin and two new fixed points exist at nonzero eccentricity and pericentre argument values @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the latter case occurs whenever the initial inclination is larger than @xmath44 , sometimes called the kozai limit .",
    "the important take - away message is that the circular orbit is no more a stable solution for high - inclination orbits in the model of exterior ring / disc perturbation .",
    "initially circular orbits would be driven over a kozai timescale @xmath45 to a very high eccentricity state .",
    "unavoidable stellar scattering processes would in a short time destabilize an initially coherent stream of objects near the centre .",
    "we now consider combined effect of the stellar cusp and the cnd potentials on the long - term orbital evolution of the stellar orbit .",
    "the total , orbit - averaged potential @xmath46 still obeys axial symmetry , being independent on the nodal longitude .",
    "the picture , however , may be modified with respect to the case of solely ring - like perturbation . considering the cusp of the late - type stars whose potential is approximated with ( [ bw3 ] ) , we find that the two types of topologies of the @xmath47 isolines persist ( see fig .  [ kozaimodes ] ) but",
    "the onset of the circular - orbit instability depends now on two parameters , namely @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "a nonzero mass of the stellar cusp stabilizes small eccentricity evolution and the critical angle is pushed to larger values .",
    "for large enough @xmath50 , the stability of the circular orbit is guaranteed for arbitrary value of @xmath48 and hence orbits of an arbitrary inclination with respect to the cnd symmetry plane .",
    "this is because the effects of the stellar cusp potential make the argument of pericentre circulate fast enough ( significantly faster than the kozai timescale ) , preventing thus secular increase of the eccentricity .",
    "an initially near - circular orbit maintains a very small value of @xmath14 showing only small - amplitude oscillations .",
    "[ ecc ] shows critical inclination values , for which the circular orbit becomes necessarily unstable as a function of @xmath50 and @xmath22 parameters ( note the later factorizes out from the analysis when @xmath34 ) .",
    "importantly , there is a correlation between @xmath50 and @xmath22 below which circular orbits of an arbitrary inclination are stable ; for instance , data in fig .",
    "[ ecc ] indicate that for @xmath51 any circular orbit with @xmath52 is stable .    in conclusion , we observe that having enough mass in the late - type stellar cusp may produce strong enough perturbation to maintain small eccentricity of an initially near - circular orbit . with that said ,",
    "we find it reasonable to make an important simplification within our analytic approach to the system of two ( multiple ) stars .",
    "namely , we will further consider the stellar orbits to be circular during the whole evolution of the system .",
    "this prevents ( together with the assumption of well separated orbits with constant semi - major axes ) close encounters of the stars . in this case only , and under the assumption that there are no orbital resonances among the individual stars , the mutual interaction of the stars may be reasonably considered as a perturbation to the dominating potential of the smbh .",
    "as we demonstrate in the next sections , this simple treatment provides useful insights into the evolution of the young - stream orbits even if they are generally non - circular .",
    "having discussed our assumptions about semi - major axes , eccentricity and pericentre of the stellar orbits , we may now turn to description of the evolution of the two remaining orbital elements  inclination and nodal longitude .",
    "we start with a model of two interacting stars and later generalize it to the case of an arbitrary number of stars .",
    "the major leap - forward in the model is that we now take into account also mutual gravitational effects of the two stars . on the contrary , note that the orbit - averaged potential energy ( [ bw3 ] ) of the late - type stellar cusp depends on the semi - major axis and eccentricity only , and thus does not influence evolution of inclination and node .",
    "for that reason it drops from our analysis in this section .",
    "the interaction potential energy @xmath53 for two point sources of masses @xmath3 and @xmath54 at relative positions @xmath55 and @xmath56 with respect to the centre reads ) provides the interaction energy as it appears in the equation of relative motion of stars with respect to the centre . henceforth , the perturbation series start with a quadrupole term ( @xmath57 ) . ]",
    "@xmath58 where @xmath59 are legendre polynomials , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the series in the right - hand side of equation  ( [ co1 ] ) converge for @xmath62 .",
    "since we are going to apply ( [ co1 ] ) to the simplified case of two circular orbits , we may replace distances @xmath63 and @xmath64 with the corresponding values of semi - major axis @xmath13 and @xmath65 , such that @xmath66 now ( note that the orbit whose parameters are denoted with a prime is thus assumed interior ) .",
    "the averaging of the interaction energy over the uniform orbital motion of the stars about the centre , implying periodic variation of @xmath67 , is readily performed by using the addition theorem for spherical harmonics .",
    "this allows us to decouple unit direction vectors in the argument of the legendre polynomial @xmath68 and easily obtain the required average of @xmath69 over the orbital periods of the two stars .",
    "after a simple algebra we obtain @xmath70 where @xmath71^{\\rm t}$ ] and @xmath72^{\\rm t}$ ] are unit vectors normal to the mean orbital planes of the two stars , and @xmath73 ^ 2 \\zeta^\\ell p_\\ell\\left(x\\right)\\ , .",
    "& & \\label{co3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as expected , the potential energy is only a function of : ( i ) the orbital semi - major axes through dependence on @xmath13 and @xmath74 , and ( ii ) the relative configuration of the two orbits in space given by the scalar product @xmath75 .",
    "note also that the series in ( [ co3 ] ) contain only even multipoles @xmath76 ( @xmath77 for @xmath76 odd ) and that they converge when @xmath78 .",
    "however , a special care is needed when @xmath79 is very close to unity , thus the two stellar orbits are close to each other , when hundreds to thousands terms are needed to achieve sufficient accuracy .",
    "still , we found it is very easy to set up an efficient computer algorithm , using recurrent relations between the legendre polynomials , which is able to evaluate ( [ co3 ] ) and its derivatives . in practice , we select a required accuracy and the code truncates the series by estimating the remained terms .",
    "in fact , since our approach neglects small eccentricity oscillations of the orbits we are anyway not allowed to set @xmath80 arbitrarily close to unity .",
    "theoretically , we should require @xmath81 by not letting the stars approach closer than the hill radius of their mutual interaction . in the numerical examples we present below",
    ", this sets an upper limit @xmath82 .",
    "the formulation given above immediately provides potential energy of the star - cnd interaction . in this case the stellar orbits are always interior to the cnd with symmetry axis suitably chosen as the unity vector @xmath83 in the direction of the @xmath84-axis of our reference system . unlike in section  [ cnd_kozai ] ,",
    "we restrict now to the case of circular orbit of the star but at the low computer - time expense we may include all multipole terms till specified accuracy is achieved . as a result the orbit - averaged interaction energy with the exterior stellar orbit is given by @xmath85 and similarly for the interior stellar orbit : @xmath86 the total orbit - averaged potential energy perturbing motion of the two stars is then given by superposition of the three terms : @xmath87 recalling that semi - major axis values are constant , eccentricity set to zero and thus argument of pericentre undefined , we are left to study dynamics of inclination @xmath25 and @xmath88 and longitude of node @xmath24 and @xmath89 values .",
    "lagrange equations provide ( see , e.g. , bertotti et  al .",
    "2003 ) @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 denote mean motion frequencies of the two stars .",
    "note the particularly simple , quasi - hamiltonian form of equations  ( [ co7a ] ) and ( [ co7b ] ) .",
    "they can also be rewritten in a more compact way using the normal vectors @xmath93 and @xmath94 to the respective orbit , namely @xmath95 inserting here @xmath96 from ( [ co6 ] ) , we finally obtain @xmath97 where @xmath98 note the frequencies in ( [ co10a ] ) to ( [ co10d ] ) depend on both @xmath93 and @xmath94 through their presence in the argument of @xmath99 which breaks the apparent simplicity of the system of equations  ( [ co9a ] ) and ( [ co9b ] ) .    the coupled set of equations  ( [ co9a ] ) and ( [ co9b ] ) acquires simple solutions in two limiting cases .",
    "first , when @xmath100 ( i.e. mutual interaction of stars is neglected ) the two equations decouple and describe simple precession of @xmath93 and @xmath94 about @xmath83 axis of the inertial frame with frequencies @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the sign minus of these frequencies recalls that the orbits precess in a retrograde sense when inclinations are less than @xmath42 and vice versa .",
    "both inclinations @xmath25 and @xmath88 are constant . in the second limit , when @xmath103 ( i.e. the circumnuclear torus is removed ) the equations  ( [ co9a ] ) and ( [ co9b ] ) obey a general integral of total angular momentum conservation @xmath104 both vectors @xmath93 and @xmath94 then precess about @xmath105 with the same frequency @xmath106 keeping the same mutual configuration . in particular , initially coplanar orbits ( i.e. @xmath93 and @xmath94 parallel ) would not evolve , which is in agreement with intuition .    unfortunately , we were not able to find analytical solution to the ( [ co9a ] ) and ( [ co9b ] ) system except for these two situations described above . obviously , it can be always solved using numerical methods as we shall discuss in section  [ ns ] .",
    "integral in the @xmath25 or @xmath88 vs. @xmath107 space . for sake of example",
    "we use orbits of two equal - mass stars ( @xmath108 ) with semi - major axes @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "the mass of the cnd is set to @xmath111 .",
    "the individual lines correspond to different values of stellar mass : @xmath112 ( curves  1 ) , @xmath113 ( curves  2 ) , @xmath114 ( curves  3 ) , and @xmath115 ( curves  4 ) .",

    "our assumptions about the circumnuclear torus mass distribution still provide a symmetry vector @xmath83 .",
    "thus , while the total angular momentum @xmath105 is no more conserved now , its projection onto @xmath83 is still an integral of motion @xmath117 because @xmath3 , @xmath118 and @xmath74 are constant , equation  ( [ co14 ] ) provides a direct constraint of how the two inclinations @xmath25 and @xmath88 evolve . in particular , one can be expressed as a function of the other .",
    "the quasi - hamiltonian form of equations  ( [ co7a ] ) and ( [ co7b ] ) readily results in a second integral of motion @xmath119 the list of arguments in @xmath96 , as explicitly provided above , reminds that it actually depends on : ( i ) the inclination values @xmath25 and @xmath88 , and ( ii ) the difference @xmath120 of the nodal longitudes of the two interacting orbits . using ( [ co14 ] )",
    ", the conservation of @xmath96 thus provides a constraint between the evolution of @xmath25 and @xmath121 ( say ) .",
    "while not giving a solution of the problem , the constraint due to combination of first integrals ( [ co14 ] ) and ( [ co15 ] ) can still provide useful insights .",
    "[ int ] illustrates how the first integrals help understanding several features of the orbital evolution for two interacting stars at distances @xmath109 and @xmath110 . for sake of simplicity",
    "we also assume their mass is equal , hence @xmath108 , and the cnd has been given mass @xmath111 .",
    "data in this figure show constrained evolution of orbital inclinations @xmath88 ( solid lines ) and @xmath25 ( dashed lines ) as a function of nodal difference @xmath121 .",
    "the two orbits were assumed to be initially coplanar ( @xmath116 ) with an inclination of @xmath122 .",
    "a set of curves correspond to different values of stellar masses , from small ( 1 ) to larger values ( 4 ) , which basically means increasing strength of their mutual gravitational interaction .",
    "first , conservation of the @xmath83-projected orbital angular momentum , as given by equation  ( [ co14 ] ) , requires that increase in @xmath88 is compensated by decrease of @xmath25 .",
    "this results in a near - mirror - imaged evolution of the two inclinations . using the first equation of ( [ co7a ] )",
    ", one finds @xmath123 which straightforwardly implies that the outer stellar orbit is initially torqued to decrease its inclination while the inner orbit increases its inclination .",
    "this is because initially @xmath124 , and @xmath125 is positive , and at the same time , precession of the nodes is dominated by interaction with the cnd which makes the outward orbit node to drift faster ( and hence @xmath126 is negative ) .",

    "their mutual gravitational interaction is weak letting the effects of the cnd dominate ( curve 1 ) .",
    "the orbits regularly precess with different frequency , given their different distance from the centre , and thus @xmath107 acquires all values between @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",

    "become only small loops about the origin .",
    "this means that @xmath107 is bound to oscillate in a small interval near origin and inclination perturbation becomes strongly damped .",

    "both solutions are nearly identical , which confirms validity of the secular perturbation theory used in this paper .        for sake of further discussion",
    "we find it useful to comment in a little more detail on the case of two , nearly independently precessing orbits ( bottom panels on fig .",

    "the previous formulation straightforwardly generalizes to the case of @xmath0 stars orbiting the centre on circular orbits with semi - major axes @xmath148 ( @xmath149 ) .",
    "this is because the potential energies of all pairwise interactions built the total @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the mass of the @xmath152-th star , @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 is the normal vector to the orbital plane of the @xmath152-th star .",
    "similarly , interaction with the cnd is simply given by @xmath156 the total potential energy of perturbing interactions is @xmath157 and the equations of orbital evolution now read @xmath158 for @xmath149 ( @xmath159 is the frequency of the unperturbed mean motion of the @xmath152-th star about the centre ) .",
    "their first integrals then can be written as @xmath160 and @xmath161    due to mutual interaction of multiple stars , solutions of equations  ( [ co20 ] ) represent , in general , an intricate orbital evolution , whose course is hardly predictable as it strongly depends upon the initial setup .",
    "our numerical experiments show , however , that it is still possible to identify several qualitative features which remain widely valid .",
    "for instance , a group of orbits with small separations may orbitaly couple together and effectively act as a single orbit in interaction with the rest of the stellar system .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ regular ] which shows two sample solutions of equations  ( [ co20 ] ) for a system of two such groups . for sake of clarity ,",

    "[ two_stars ] . for the same reason ,",
    "all the individual masses are considered equal , @xmath166 , and set to @xmath167 in the lower panels , while for the upper panels we assume @xmath168 .",
    "the other parameters remain identical to the case of the two - orbits models . as we can see ( cf . figs  [ regular ] and [ two_stars ] ) , the dynamical impact of each coupled pair of orbits upon the rest of the stellar system is equivalent to the effect of the corresponding single orbit if both the total mass and semi - major axis of the pair are appropriate .",
    "the individual orbits within each pair then naturally oscillate about the single - orbit solution according to their mutual interaction .",
    "this conclusion remains valid even in more complicated systems as we shall show in the next section .",
    "in order to illustrate the complexity of solutions of equations  ( [ co20 ] ) , let us now analyze the evolution of a system which contains an initially thin stellar disc with a distribution of semi - major axes of the orbits @xmath169 . as we can see in fig .",
    "[ chaos ] , the oscillations of the orbital inclinations no longer have the simple patterns which we observed for the models discussed in the previous paragraphs . on the other hand , we still can identify a well defined group of orbits which coherently change their orientation with respect to the cnd .",
    "these orbits thus form a rather thin disc during the whole monitored period of time .",
    "it turns out that they represent the innermost parts of the initial disc where the separations of the neighbouring orbits are small enough for their mutual interaction to couple them together .",
    "the configuration considered in fig .",
    "[ chaos ] roughly matches the main qualitative features of an astrophysical system which is observed in the centre of the milky way .",
    "it contains a group of early - type stars orbiting the smbh on nearly keplerian orbits .",
    "observations suggest that about one half of them form a coherently rotating disc - like structure with estimated surface density profile @xmath170 @xcite which implies the above considered distribution of semi - major axes .",
    "the rest of the early - type stars then appear to be on randomly oriented orbits .",
    "both the origin and observed configuration of these stars represent rather puzzling questions . due to strong tidal field of the smbh ,",
    "it is impossible for a star to be formed in this region by any standard star formation mechanism . on the other hand , as the observed stars are assumed to be young , no usual transport mechanism is efficient enough to bring them from farther regions , where their formation would be less intricate , within their estimated lifetime .",
    "one of the most promising scenarios of their origin thus considers formation in situ , via fragmentation of a self - gravitating gaseous disc @xcite .",
    "however , since this process naturally forms stars in a single disc - like structure , it does not explain the origin of the stars observed outside the disc .",
    "hence , in order to justify the in - disc scenario of the formation of the early - type stars in the galactic centre , some mechanism that may have dragged some of them out from the parent stellar disc plane is needed .    in our previous paper @xcite , we have discussed a possibility that all the early - type stars had been born in a single disc which has been , subsequently , partially disrupted by the gravity of the cnd .",
    "we have considered the same configuration of the sources of the gravitational field as in the current paper and followed the evolution of the disc by means of direct @xmath0-body integration . we have observed coherent evolution of the inner dense part of the disc which exhibited a tendency to increase its inclination with respect to the cnd . on the other hand ,",
    "most of the orbits of the outer parts of the initially coherently rotating disc precessed independently due to the influence of the cnd and , consequently , became detached from the parent structure .",
    "this behaviour is in accord with the analysis presented in the current paper .",
    "furthermore , we can now calculate the order of magnitude characteristic time - scale for the ` canonical ' model of @xcite whose system parameters read : @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 , @xmath174 , and @xmath175 . in order to determine the rough time estimate , we use formula ( [ char ] ) . as this formula has been derived for a system of two stars ,",
    "we replace the stellar disc with two characteristic particles at certain radii @xmath65 , @xmath13 in the sense of section  [ sec : nstars ] . for this purpose ,",
    "let us divide the stars in the disc into two groups according to their initial distance from the centre and define @xmath65 and @xmath13 as the radii of the orbits of the median stars in the inner and outer group , i.e. @xmath176 and @xmath177 . inserting these values into formula ( [ char ] ) , we obtain @xmath178 for the ` canonical ' model .",
    "this value is in order of magnitude agreement with the estimated age of the early - type stars , @xmath179 @xcite , since the core of the disc reaches its maximal inclination with respect to the cnd already after a fraction of period @xmath180 as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ regular ] and [ chaos ] .",
    "let us emphasize that the results reported in our previous paper @xcite have been acquired by means of full - fledged numerical integration of equations of motion . as a consequence",
    ", both the eccentricities and semi - major axes of the individual stellar orbits in the disc have been naturally undergoing a significant evolution due to two - body relaxation of the disc .",
    "moreover , our prior numerical computations have also confirmed that results similar to those obtained for the ` canonical ' model are valid for a wide set of models with different system parameters , including the case with zero mass , @xmath181 , of the spherical cusp of the late - type stars . in the later case ,",
    "the orbital eccentricities and inclinations within the stellar disc are subject to high - amplitude kozai oscillations . in conclusion",
    ", it appears that the inner part of the disc may evolve coherently for a certain period of time even when we can not assume neither zero nor small eccentricity of the stellar orbits .",
    "we , therefore , suggest that also some of the key qualitative predictions of the semi - analytic theory developed in the current paper under the simplifying assumption of circular orbits may be carefully applied to more general , non - circular systems .",
    "finally , let us mention that , in addition to the core of the disc , less significant groups of orbits with coherent secular evolution may exist even in the outer parts of the disc if their separations are small enough .",
    "our semi - analytic approach thus admits possible existence of secondary disc - like structures in the observed young stellar system which has indeed been discussed by several authors @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the secular orbital evolution of a system of @xmath0 mutually interacting stars on nearly - circular orbits around the dominating central mass , considering the perturbative gravitational influence of a distant axisymmetric source and an extended spherical potential . given",
    "the spherical potential is strong enough , we have shown that the secular evolution of initially circular orbits reduces to the evolution of inclinations and nodal longitudes .",
    "the spherical potential itself can then be factorized out from the outcoming momentum equations .",
    "since we have not been able , in a general case , to solve the derived equations analytically , we have set up an integrator for their efficient numerical solution .",
    "the acquired results have then been , in order to confirm their validity , compared with the corresponding full - fledged numerical integrations in the space of classical positions and momenta , showing a remarkable agreement .",
    "some fundamental features of the possible solutions of the new equations can be understood by an analysis of the integrals of motion . in the case of the simplest possible system of two stars interacting in the considered perturbed potential ,",
    "we have identified two qualitatively different modes of its secular evolution . if the interaction of the stars is weak ( yet still non - zero ) , the secular evolution of their orbits is dominated by an independent nodal precession .",
    "difference of the individual precession rates then determines the period of oscillations of the orbital inclinations . on the other hand ,",
    "when the gravitational interaction of the stars is sufficiently strong ( depending on their mass and the radii of their orbits ) , the secular evolution of the orbits becomes dynamically coupled and , consequently , they precess coherently around the symmetry axis of the gravitational potential . oscillations of the orbital inclinations are , in this case , considerably damped .",
    "we have further confirmed , by means of numerical integration of the derived momentum equations , that the coupling of strongly interacting orbits is a generic process that may occur even in more complex @xmath0-body systems . in particular , a subset of stars with strong mutual interaction evolves coherently and , as a result , its dynamical impact upon the rest of the @xmath0-body system is similar to the effect of a single particle of suitable mass and orbital radius .    as an example , we have investigated evolution of a disc - like structure that roughly models the young stellar system which is observed in the galactic centre . it has turned out that the semi - analytic work presented in this paper provides a physical background for understanding of the processes discovered , by means of full @xmath0-body integration , in @xcite .",
    "namely , coupling of the strongly interacting stars from the inner parts of the disc leads to their coherent orbital evolution , which allows us to observe a disc - like structure even after several million years of dynamical evolution in the tidal field of the cnd .",
    "orientation of this surviving disc then inevitably changes towards higher inclination with respect to the cnd , which is in accord with the observations . on the other hand , stellar orbits from the outer parts of the disc evolve",
    "individually , being gradually stripped out from the parent thin disc structure .",
    "hence , it appears possible for the puzzle of the origin of the young stars in the galactic centre to be solved by the hypothesis of their formation via fragmentation of a single gaseous disc , as already suggested in ubr , schovancov & kroupa ( 2009 ) and @xcite .",
    "note that , beside the physical explanation of the processes observed in our previous work , the current approach would be , due to its low numerical demands , useful for extensive scanning of the parameter space in order to confront our model with the observations more thoroughly .",
    "this is going to be a subject of our future work when more accurate observational data will be available .",
    "finally , let us mention that our semi - analytic model has been developed under several simplifying assumptions .",
    "most importantly , the torus cnd has been considered stationary and the cusp of the late - type stars spherically symmetric .",
    "if any of these assumptions were violated , the results might be more or less affected .",
    "for example , a possible anisotropy of the cusp of the late - type stars due to chance alignment of some of its stars would break its spherical symmetry . in that case",
    ", the resulting gravitational torques might have a considerable impact on the dynamical evolution of the stellar disc as shown by @xcite .",
    "however , since the current observational data do not show evidence for such violations , we may consider our model physically plausible .",
    "moreover , the currently available data do suggest roughly perpendicular mutual orientation of the cnd and the stellar disc , which is in accord with the predictions of both our numerical and semi - analytic model .",
    "we consider this as a supporting argument for our findigs .",
