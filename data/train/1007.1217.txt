    "the first main result of this paper is that such a loss _ does not occur_. specifically , we prove that @xmath5 solutions in the class remain bounded in the @xmath5-norm in the external region all the way up to the blow - up time , resolving an open problem posed in raphal - szeftel @xcite ( comment 1 on p. 976 ) .",

    "is a natural space in which to study the equation since the conservation laws are defined and lyapunov - hamiltonian type methods , such as those used by merle - raphal in their blow - up theory , naturally yield coercivity on @xmath5 quantities .",
    "the retention of regularity in the external region has applications to the construction of new blow - up solutions , with special geometry , for @xmath1 supercritical nls equations . using their partial regularity methods , raphal @xcite and raphal - szeftel @xcite constructed spherically symmetric finite - time blow - up solutions to the quintic nls @xmath56 in dimension @xmath57 that contract toward a sphere @xmath58 following the one - dimensional quintic blow - up dynamics in the radial variable near @xmath59 .",

    "the position of the singular sphere converges : @xmath78 as @xmath77 .",

    "the solution remains @xmath5-small away from the singular sphere : for each @xmath41 , @xmath80 .    the 3d quintic nls equation is energy - critical , and the global well - posedness and scattering problem is one of several critical regularity problems that has received a lot of attention in the last decade @xcite .",
    "the global well - posedness for small data in @xmath10 is classical and follows from the strichartz estimates .",
    "our theorem [ t : main-2 ] takes a large , but special `` prefabricated '' approximate blow - up solution , and installs it near radius @xmath81 on top of a small global @xmath5 background .",
    "the main difficulty , of course , is showing that the two different components  the blow - up portion on the one hand , and the evolution of the small @xmath10 background on the other , have limited interaction and can effectively evolve separately .",
    "thus , it is not surprising that the techniques to prove theorem [ t : main ] are relevant to this analysis .",
    "we now outline the method used to prove theorem [ t : main ] .",
    "we start with a given blow - up solution @xmath0 in the merle - raphal class , and by scaling and shifting this solution , it suffices to assume that the blow - up point is @xmath82 and the blow - up time is @xmath83 , and moreover , holds over times @xmath84 .",
    "since is @xmath1 critical , the size of the @xmath1 norm is highly relevant . by mass conservation , we know that @xmath85 for all @xmath86 and all @xmath87 , where @xmath88 denotes the littlewood - paley frequency projection .",
    "however , shows that for @xmath89 , we have @xmath90 , which is a better estimate for these large frequencies @xmath86 . in  3 , we show that this smallness of high frequencies reinforces itself and ultimately proves that for @xmath91 , the solution is @xmath5 bounded .",
    "this is achieved using dispersive estimates typically employed in local well - posedness arguments  the strichartz and bourgain s bilinear strichartz estimates  after the equation has been restricted to high frequencies .",
    "we note that this improvement of regularity at high frequencies is proved _ globally in space_.    for the schrdinger equation , frequencies of size @xmath86 propagate at speed @xmath86 , and thus , travel a distance @xmath92 over a time @xmath93 .",
    "therefore , at time @xmath94 , a component of the solution in the blow - up core at frequency @xmath86 will effectively only make it out of the blow - up core and into the external region before the blow - up time provided @xmath95 .",
    "thus , we expect that the blow - up action , which is taking place at frequency @xmath96 , will not be able to exit the blow - up core before blow - up time .",
    "this is the philosophy behind the analysis in ",
    "[ s : finite - speed ] . recall that in ",
    "[ s : high - frequency ] , we have controlled the solution at frequencies above @xmath97 . in  [ s : finite - speed ] , we apply a spatial localization to the external region , and then look to control the remaining low frequencies , i.e. , those frequencies below @xmath97 .",
    "we examine the equation solved by @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is a spatial restriction to the external region . in estimating the inhomogeneous terms",
    ", we can make use of the frequency restriction to exchange @xmath100-spatial derivatives for a time factor @xmath101 .",
    "this enables us to prove a low - frequency recurrence : the @xmath102 size of the solution in the external region is bounded by the @xmath103 size of the solution in a slightly larger external region .",
    "iteration gives the @xmath5 boundedness .",
