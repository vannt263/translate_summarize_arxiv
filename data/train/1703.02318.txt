    "array beamforming @xcite is a promising technique for audio surveillance and multi - conferencing .",
    "this technique enables the capture of a desired sound arriving from a certain spatial direction while suppressing undesired sounds coming from other directions .",
    "applications such as acoustic surveillance , i.e. the unobtrusive monitoring and acoustic tracking of people located at relatively far distances and in actual noisy environments , can benefit from sound beamforming systems as these microphone arrays do not have mechanical movable parts .",
    "certain compact array geometries make it possible for such microphone array systems to be implemented and used effectively in acoustic surveillance and multi - conferencing . + acoustic beamforming has been thoroughly studied @xcite,@xcite .",
    "a microphone array is composed of several microphones aligned in a specific pattern or geometry to operate as a single device .",
    "microphone arrays appeared nearly three decades ago , but this is still a field with active research @xcite .",
    "a microphone array has the capability of separating between various signals by utilizing some techniques of filtering , substantially boosting the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "the reading of all microphones are sampled and processed on a digital signal processing ( dsp ) computer to obtain the relevant signal and discarded the unwanted one .",
    "it can be utilized for various applications , for instance , finding the location of sound sources or distinguish between sounds according to direction without the need to physically move the array of microphones .",
    "+ the aim of this paper is to explore and understand the two main microphone array geometries , namely linear and circular , implement then in a software simulation environment , and carry out a quantitative and qualitative comparative performance analysis .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : firstly , an illustration of the principles of beamforming is presented based on two structures , linear array beamformer and circular array beamformer in order to compare between them .",
    "after that , results of simulation done based on linear array and circular array beam - pattern are provided to verify which configuration gives the best performance .",
    "finally the further work and conclusions close the paper .",

    "figure [ fig_linarray ] illustrates schematically the basic delay - and - sum ( das ) beamformer on a linear array .",
    "the sound source given by @xmath2 arrives at the direction given by @xmath1 , while the microphone array has been set up to point to the direction @xmath0 . in far - field conditions",
    "( the distance of the sound source is much larger than the array size ) , the signal captured by by @xmath3th microphone results in @xmath4 where @xmath5 represents the physical time delay at the @xmath3th microphone .",
    "it is simple to deduce that for such a geometric arrangement , the delay @xmath5 corresponds to @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the distance between adjacent microphones , @xmath8 is the speed of sound in air , @xmath9 is the number of microphones , and the microphone index @xmath3 runs as @xmath10 . note that the signal at the microphone is then sampled and sent to a digital signal processor .",
    "however , for the sake of simplicity in the exposition , we will use continuous time in the subsequent analysis .",
    "the @xmath3th channel is then digitally delayed as @xmath11 where @xmath12 corresponds to the digital delay applied to the @xmath3th channel .",
    "since the array is meant to be pointing to angle @xmath0 , the digital delay @xmath12 can be easily obtained from , that is , @xmath13 finally , all channels are averaged , this resulting in the final das signal as follows @xmath14 if the steering angle @xmath0 is set to the actual direction of the incoming sound @xmath1 , the physical and digital delays compensate ( @xmath15 ) , and the beamformer output is equal to the sound source signal , @xmath16 . in general , the averaging among the signals at the adder results in the frequency - selective attenuation of the signal , as the translation of the beamformer output to the frequency domain reveals @xmath17 here @xmath18 is frequency , @xmath19 and @xmath20 correspond to the fourier transform of @xmath21 and @xmath2 respectively , and @xmath22 is the transfer function of the beamformer with steering angle @xmath0 @xmath23 it is immediate to see that if the incoming sound arrives at the steering angle @xmath24 , then @xmath25 , hence @xmath26 , that is , the sound signal is captured without spectral distortion .",
    "the linear geometry presents unfortunately an additional situation at which @xmath25 , which is for @xmath27 .",
    "this  ambiguity \" lobe is as dominant as the main one . in any other case @xmath28",
    ", the beamformer output will undergo a certain frequency - selective attenuation according to .",
    "figure [ fig_circarray ] depicts the same das principle in a microphone array with circular geometry .",
    "this figure illustrates also the delay pattern at all the microphones : the delay pattern follows a trigonometric relation determined by the angle of each microphone @xmath29 with respect to the direction of arrival @xmath1 . the physical delay that the incoming sound experiences at each microphone depends on the difference between the previous angles , that is , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the radius of the circular geometry .",
    "it is important to relate the radius @xmath31 with the distance between adjacent microphones @xmath7 , a relation that follows @xmath32 the digital delays follow the same trigonometric rule depending on the steering angle @xmath0 @xmath33 unlike in the linear case , the circular geometry does not present any  ambiguity \" lobe : the equation @xmath15 , that is , @xmath34 has only one solution , namely , @xmath35 .",

    "the beamformer response @xmath22 of a microphone array is also called _",
    "beam pattern_. we establish here a comparison between the response of a uniform linear and circular @xmath36-microphone array .",
    "the beam pattern is frequency @xmath18 and doa @xmath1 dependent , a two - dimensions + the frequency response of the das beamformer is calculated over a significant frequency range of interest , namely , from @xmath38 hz to @xmath40 hz , hence the following figures are obtained for linear and circular arrays .",
    "figure [ fig_linearbp ] portrays the beam pattern for @xmath36-microphone linear array , whereas figure [ fig_circularbp ] describes the beam pattern for @xmath36-microphone circular array . for both geometries ,",
    "the distance between the microphones in the array is small ( @xmath41 cm ) .",
    "the simulation over @xmath42 in the linear array , generates two main lobes located at @xmath43 and @xmath44 . while the simulation in the circular array , produces one main lobe located at @xmath43 and seven other lobes with negligible magnitude",
    "therefore , the total number of lobes in the response of the circular array is eight . in both linear and circular arrays , for a fixed beam pattern length , the beam width is decreasing much more with increasing frequency . as shown in linear array ,",
    "the response at the direction of the two main lobes is unity gain in linear scale .",
    "therefore , the beamforming is enormously enhanced for medium and high frequencies .",
    "furthermore , there is no aliasing in the sampled acoustic signal .",
    "the beam pattern of the circular array demonstrates that the main lobe has a unity gain in linear scale at @xmath43 steering angle .",
    "however , the beamforming is poor at low frequencies .",
    "other lobes such as the one at @xmath44 have incomparable response and they reject the acoustic signals almost in the medium frequencies . + figure [ fig_polarplot ] brings a visual comparison between the beam pattern ( in polar coordinates ) for the linear and circular microphone array beamformer at the following single frequencies : @xmath38 hz , @xmath39 hz , and @xmath40 hz respectively .",
    "the linear array delivers a narrow beam with low - magnitude side lobes ; however , the presence of an  ambiguity \" lobe represents a severe handicap of this geometry . on the other hand ,",
    "the circular array presents one single main lobe , but several side lobes or  granting \" lobes are manifestable ; however those lobes are sporadic and not consistent along the desired bandwidth .",
    "the beamforming performance at low frequencies is poor in both geometries .",

    "the signal used in the experiments corresponds to a speech signal sampled at @xmath46 khz : the sampling frequency is @xmath47 times the bandwidth of interest ( @xmath47 khz ) , a value required to implement the digital delays with enough accuracy .",
    "the steering angle of the array is @xmath43 , @xmath48 , and the sound doa is @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "figure [ fig_speech ] shows on top the original speech signal , which simulates the sound source .",
    "the two lower pictures illustrate the spectral attenuation pattern for each array geometry .",
    "the linear geometry clearly has the upper hand , with attenuation levels of @xmath51@xmath52 db consistently along the bandwidth . on the other hand ,",
    "the circular geometry delivers good attenuation levels , reaching the @xmath51 db mark , although not throughout the whole bandwidth of interest .",
    "the beamforming effect in the lowest part of the spectrum is in both cases inefficient .",
    "nevertheless , our listening tests confirmed the efficacy of beamforming as technique for spatial discrimination of sound sources .",
    "the analysis and simulated results presented in this paper confirms the efficacy of microphone - array beamforming at attenuating sound sources coming from directions different than the predefined steering angle ; any sound source coming at this angle is captured with no distortion .",
    "this work corresponds to the analysis stage of a bsc thesis aiming at implementing in real hardware a circular microphone array .",
    "several milestones need to be achieved , such as , mounting electret microphones and their preamplifiers in a physical circular frame , implementing the digital beamforming algorithms in a @xmath36-channel dsp board , and improving the signal processing algorithms . in this respect",
