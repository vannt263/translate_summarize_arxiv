    "optical lattice ultracold atoms continue to be of interest for more and more researches of different branches of physics @xcite .",
    "big attention is given for the realization of different condensed matter models that provide a test system for achieving a deep understanding of fundamental physics and answering open questions in the subject @xcite , beside their applications for quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "in general , the main objective is to consider optical lattice ultracold atoms as artificial crystals with a wide range of controllable parameters .",
    "optical lattices form of counter propagating laser beams to get standing waves in which ground state ultracold atoms are loaded @xcite .",
    "the atoms experience optical lattice potential with lattice constant of half wave length of the laser .",
    "low dimensional lattices can be achieved with different geometric structures and symmetries @xcite . in conventional solid crystals",
    "the lattice constant and the symmetry of the lattice is fixed through the different chemical bonds that responsible for the formation of the crystal .",
    "the advantage of optical lattices is due to the controllability of the lattice constant and symmetry through controlling the external laser field @xcite .",
    "collective states of electronic excitations play a central rule in solid crystals and molecular clusters and they usually termed excitons @xcite .",
    "they induced by electrostatic interactions among the lattice atoms or molecules , where an electronic excitation can be delocalized in the crystal through energy transfer .",
    "collective states can dominate the electrical and optical properties of the material , and especially they strongly affect the excitation lifetimes and give rise to dark and superradiant states . in such material",
    "the lattice constant is few angstroms which is much smaller than the electronic transition wavelength , and hence one can use electrostatic interactions , e.g. resonance dipole - dipole interactions , and to neglect radiative corrections altogether .",
    "electronic excitations in optical lattice ultracold atoms are of big importance , e.g. , for optical lattice clocks @xcite , and for optical lattice rydberg atoms @xcite . in our previous work we introduced excitons for optical lattice ultracold atoms in one and two dimensional set - ups @xcite .",
    "we concentrated mainly in the mott insulator phase with one and two atoms per lattice site .",
    "we treated both large and finite atomic chains @xcite , and we calculated the damping rate of excitons into free space and their emission pattern @xcite . in all of our previous researches we exploited electrostatic interactions for the formation of collective states , mainly resonance dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "but for typical optical lattices the lattice constant is few thousands of angstroms , which can be of the order of the electronic transition wavelength , and hence radiative corrections can be significant .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate a one dimensional finite chain of atoms where the lattice constant can take any value relative to the atomic transition wavelength .",
    "finite atomic chains have been realized recently in a number of optical lattice experiments @xcite .",
    "we emphasize the influence of radiative corrections on the formation of collective sates and their damping rates , where we exploit general collective states with emphasize on the most symmetric one .",
    "we derive the condition for the validity of applying electrostatic interactions , which we used in our previous work .",
    "few studies treated the collective effect on the optical properties of finite atomic chain of several atoms @xcite , but extensive study done for two atoms in the radiative regime @xcite , and in which we compare our results .",
    "we extract how the damping rate depends on the chain size , namely on the number of atoms in the lattice .",
    "furthermore , we calculate the emission pattern off a finite atomic chain .    the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we present a finite one dimensional atomic chain and discuss the energy transfer parameter due to dipole - dipole interactions in the radiative regime .",
    "then in section 3 we calculate the damping rates for different collective states and several chain sizes .",

    "for example , chains of semiconductor quantum dots fit exactly in the regime of large lattice constant , where radiative corrections are unavoidable , and the life times of their collective states can be treated according to the present paper .",
    "other system that exploits the regime of the present paper is a lattice of large organic molecules sitting on a matrix with a given large lattice constant , the collective damping rate and emission pattern are expected to behave according to our present results ."
