    "x ray binaries exhibit quasi - periodic behaviors on time scales ranging from millisecond to days or more . systematic monitoring of these sources , and the use of instruments with high timing resolution such as the rossi x ray timing explorer ( rxte ) , it has become possible to distinguish several type of qpo s , based on their frequency , and to correlate their properties with the spectral state of the source . + in the case of 1915 at least three types of qpo s have so far been detected : a 67hz one during soft high states ( morgan , remillard & greiner , 1997 ) , a 67mhz one , also present during soft high states ( morgan , remillard & greiner , 1997 ) , and a @xmath0hz variable qpo which appears to be ubiquitous during the low hard state .",
    "we focus here only on this ubiquitous qpo , for which several studies have pointed out correlations between the spectral and the temporal parameters , such as the source flux and qpo frequency ( markwardt , 1999 ) , or the inner disk temperature and qpo frequency ( muno , 1999 ) .",
    "+ an intriguing result was recently reported by sobczak ( 1999 ) , who found that in 1655 the correlation between the qpo frequency and the disk inner radius was the opposite of that found in 1550 . in previous work",
    "we have confirmed this reversed correlation and compared 1655 with 1915 ( varnire , rodriguez & tagger , 2001 ; rodriguez , 2001 ) .",
    "we showed that it could be explained ( see fig [ fig : correl ] ) if the qpo is identified with the accretion - ejection instability ( aei ) of tagger & pellat ( 1999 ) .",
    "we show on figure [ fig:17 - 04qpo ] dynamical power spectra of the source in five pca energy bands .",
    "the source is in the @xmath2 state of belloni ( 1999 ) , characterized by a @xmath3 mn cycle between a high / soft and a low / hard state .",
    "each interval starts with the source in the high / soft state , showing episodically the qpo .",
    "after the `` dip '' ( at @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) marking the transition to the low / hard state , the qpo is stronger and shows a prominent harmonic , appearing as a second dark lane in the lower panels of figure 2 . a strong x - ray spike , at times @xmath6 and @xmath7 , marks a return to the high state , with again episodic occurence of the qpo ; incidentally the fundamental frequency of the qpo is close to that of the harmonic just before the spike . +",
    "comparing the lightcurves to the variations of the qpo frequency , we find that although the qpo power is stronger in the 5 - 13 kev band , its frequency variation is better correlated with the softer flux ; no qpo is observed above 40 kev ; we note that the large dips are smoothed while rising in energy , so that the soft spike corresponds to a sudden decrease of the hard emission ; this can be interpreted as the disappearance of a part of the corona , blown away by a sudden ejection coincident with the spike , as already seen during multiwavelength observations of similar states ( eikenberry , 1998 ; mirabel , 1998 ) .",
    "the source is in a low and steady state at these dates , and as we could expect from previous studies ( markwardt , 1999 ; muno , 1999 ; rodriguez , 2001 ) the qpo frequency is fairly constant ( figure [ fig:22 - 23_qpo ] ) , over the whole observations , with a value of @xmath10hz on the first two intervals of april 22 , @xmath11hz during the third one , and @xmath12hz on april 23 .",
    "+ we again extracted lightcurves and produced power spectra in 5 pca energy channels ( @xmath13kev,@xmath14kev , @xmath15kev,@xmath16kev , and above 40 kev ) .",
    "power vs. energy , for the qpo and its harmonic , are plotted in figure [ fig : qpovsenergy ] .",
    "only four ranges are plotted since the last one suffers from the lack of flux , which did not allow us to extract qpo parameters .",
    "nevertheless , we find that the qpo power increases with the energy , up to about 30 kev , whereas the harmonic decreases above 10 kev .",
    "these distinct spectral behaviour thus represent a new challenge for models of the qpo .",
    "our study confirms and expands the conclusion ( markwardt , 1999 ; muno , 1999 ) that the qpo frequency is better correlated with the softer flux , which tends to show that it has its origin in the disk , but that it affects more strongly the flux at higher energies usually considered to be emitted by the corona . in addition figure",
    "[ fig:17 - 04qpo ] shows that the presence of the harmonic is correlated to a strong coronal emission ; whenever the latter disapear , only the fundamental remains .",
    "+ tagger & pellat ( 1999 ) have shown that the inner region of the disk could exhibit what they called an accretion - ejection instability , extracting energy and angular momentum from the disk and transferring them to alfven waves emitted toward the corona .",
    "the instability forms a steady spiral pattern , rotating at a frequency compatible with that of the `` ubiquitous '' qpo ( see varnire and tagger , these proceedings ) . in this context , the harmonic can be seen as a diagnostic of the non - linear development of the instability , the formation of a hot point or a spiral shock in the disk ( rodriguez , 2001 ) .",
    "a useful analogy can be made with the gaseous shock marking the spiral arms of galaxies . in this context",
    "the diappearance of the harmonic during the high state could correspond to a weaker instability leading to less sharp non - linear features ; the decrease in the power of the harmonic at high energies , contrasting with the behavior of the fundamental , would indicate that the harmonic does not propagate to the corona .    1 belloni t. , , _ atronomy & astrophysics _",
