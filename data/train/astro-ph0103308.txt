    "theoretical models for radio - pulsar emission mechanisms include the bound states of a relativistic electron and positron in a superstrong magnetic field .",
    "the year 1985 was marked by a number of papers , where the authors tried to take into account the positronium contribution into the dispersion equation of a photon which propagates in a superstrong magnetic field ( leinson & oraevsky , @xcite , @xcite ) ; herold et al.,@xcite ; shabad & usov , @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , the correct solution of the completely relativistic problem for the bound states of an electron and positron in a superstrong magnetic field remains unknown .",
    "koller et al .",
    "@xcite have formulated the quadratic form of the completely relativistic dirac equation for bound states of an electron and positron in a magnetic field of arbitrary intensity .",
    "however , they only found a solution for the simplest case , when positronium does not move across the magnetic field .",
    "there was also the work of shabad and usov @xcite , where they tried to solve the bethe - salpeter equation for a positronium atom relativistically moving across the superstrong magnetic field .",
    "unfortunately , they did not take into account the retardation effect in the interaction between the electron and positron .",
    "for this reason , we return to the problem of positronium in a superstrong magnetic field .",
    "we suggest a solution of the bethe - salpeter equation for positronium relativistically propagating across the superstrong magnetic field .",
    "the results which contradict those given by shabad and usov are discussed .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we state the problem by considering the bethe - salpeter equation for a bound electron - positron pair interacting with an external magnetic field .",
    "the problem can be simplified when the adiabatic approximation ( discussed in section 3 ) holds , since in this case only one landau level for each particle has to be taken into account . in section 4 ,",
    "we concentrate on the particular case when the electron and positron occupy the same landau level . as a particularly important case , we devote sect .",
    "5 to the ground band of positronium levels , and analyze some particular cases . in appendix a we recall the explicit formulae of the electron ( or positron ) wave function in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "to find the bound states of electron and positron in a strong magnetic field , we start from the bethe - salpeter equation for the scattering amplitude , to the lowest order in the fine structure s constant @xmath0 @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the propagators of the electron and positron , respectively , in an external uniform magnetic field , which will be taken as directed along the @xmath4 axis . here and henceforth , a @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) subscript denotes the electron ( positron ) , and summation over repeated indices will be understood .",
    "@xmath7 , with @xmath8 is the photon propagator . in eq .",
    "( [ b_s ] ) @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the four - momenta of the interacting particles .",
    "it is convenient to study this equation in the mixed ( coordinates - energy ) representation . to this purpose , we define the new unknown function @xmath11 which depend on both individual space coordinates @xmath12 and energies of the electron and the positron .",
    "their energies can be written as : @xmath13 where the total energy @xmath14 of the bound pair is an integral of motion in the stationary state we are considering . by the use of fourier transformation of the green s functions @xmath15\\ ] ] @xmath16\\ ] ] we obtain the following equation : @xmath17 \\gamma _ { ls}^{\\mu } \\chi _ { st}\\left ( { \\bf r}_{-}^{\\prime } , { \\bf r}_{+}^{\\prime } ; \\frac{e}{2}% + \\varepsilon -\\omega , { \\bf -}\\frac{e}{2}+\\varepsilon -\\omega \\right ) \\gamma _ { tq}^{\\nu } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we choose the following gauge : @xmath18 so that @xmath19 , @xmath20 . in this way , the green s function of the electron takes the general form : @xmath21% \\frac{\\psi _ { n\\sigma } ^{\\left ( + \\right ) } ( x_{-}+\\frac{k_{2}^{-}}{eb}% , k_{3}^{-})\\overline{\\psi } _ { n\\sigma } ^{(+)}(x_{-}^{^{\\prime } } + \\frac{% k_{2}^{-}}{eb},k_{3}^{-})}{[\\varepsilon _ { -}-e_{n}(k_{3}^{-})+i0]},\\ ] ]    where @xmath22 and @xmath23 , with @xmath24 ( @xmath25 is the so - called _ critical magnetic field _ ) .",
    "the electron wave functions @xmath26 are bispinors of positive frequency which correspond to landau states of the electron in the magnetic field .",
    "each landau state of the electron is marked by the number @xmath27 which characterizes the quantized motion across the magnetic field ; @xmath28 is the electron momentum along the magnetic field ; @xmath29 corresponds to the spin projection of the electron @xmath30 . for many applications ,",
    "it is convenient to use wave functions of negative frequency for the states of positron ( see appendix a ) .",
    "then , the positron propagator has the following form : @xmath31\\frac{\\psi _ { n^{\\prime } \\sigma } ^{\\left ( -\\right ) } ( x_{+}^{^{\\prime } } -\\frac{k_{2}^{+}}{eb},-k_{3}^{+})\\overline{\\psi } % _ { n^{\\prime } \\sigma } ^{(-)}(x_{+}-\\frac{k_{2}^{+}}{eb},-k_{3}^{+})}{% [ \\varepsilon _ { + } + e_{n^{\\prime } } ( k_{3}^{+})-i0]}{},\\ ] ]    where @xmath32 .",
    "we assume that the center of mass of the positronium can move relativistically in any direction with respect to the magnetic field , i.e. , we make no assumption about the center of mass momentum @xmath33 along the magnetic field , but we assume that the longitudinal relative motion of the electron and positron is nonrelativistic . therefore , the relative momentum projection @xmath34 is much smaller than the electron mass .",
    "let us write the electron and positron momenta in the following form : @xmath35 @xmath36 thus , we may expand the landau levels energy as a series of @xmath37 : @xmath38 @xmath39    where @xmath40 .",
    "this yields @xmath41 with the reduced mass @xmath42",
    "in a sufficiently strong magnetic field @xmath43 the larmor radius @xmath44 is small with respect to the bohr s radius @xmath45 because : @xmath46 when inequality ( [ 11 ] ) holds , the coulomb s binding energy @xmath47 of the bound electron and positron vary in a small vicinity of the landau levels they occupy . in this case , the poles near these landau levels give the principal contribution to the green s functions of the electron and the positron .",
    "therefore , we can write : @xmath48% \\frac{\\psi _ { n\\sigma } ^{\\left ( + \\right ) } ( x_{-}+\\frac{k_{2}^{-}}{eb}% , k_{3}^{-})\\overline{\\psi } _ { n\\sigma } ^{(+)}(x_{-}^{^{\\prime } } + \\frac{% k_{2}^{-}}{eb},k_{3}^{-})}{[\\varepsilon _ { -}-e_{n}(k_{3}^{-})+i0]}\\ ] ] @xmath49\\frac{\\psi _ { n^{\\prime } \\sigma } ^{\\left ( -\\right ) } ( x_{+}^{^{\\prime } } -\\frac{k_{2}^{+}}{eb},-k_{3}^{+})\\overline{\\psi } % _ { n^{\\prime } \\sigma } ^{(-)}(x_{+}-\\frac{k_{2}^{+}}{eb},-k_{3}^{+})}{% [ \\varepsilon _ { + } + e_{n^{\\prime } } ( k_{3}^{+})-i0]}{}\\ ] ]    generally speaking , in the case of @xmath50 two terms corresponding to the same total energy @xmath51 give the major contribution to the product of green functions in the right - hand side of the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "the first of them corresponds to an electron occupying the landau level  @xmath52 , while the positron occupies the level @xmath53 .",
    "the second term is the state with the same energy , but with the electron occupying the level @xmath54 and the positron in the state @xmath52 . within this adiabatic approximation ,",
    "it is possible to characterize the positronium states in a strong magnetic field by the almost - good quantum numbers @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and by other additional constants , which characterize the motion of the center of mass and the relative motion of the electron and positron along the magnetic field .",
    "if both the electron and the positron occupy the same landau level , then virtual photons with small values of @xmath55 give the major contribution to the @xmath56 interaction .",
    "therefore , we can neglect @xmath57 in the photon propagator    @xmath58    this yields , for @xmath59 : @xmath60 g_{\\mu \\nu } \\gamma _ { ls}^{\\mu } \\int \\frac{% d\\omega } { 2\\pi } \\chi _ { st}\\left ( { \\bf r}_{-}^{\\prime } , { \\bf r}_{+}^{\\prime } ; % \\frac{e}{2}+\\omega , { \\bf -}\\frac{e}{2}+\\omega \\right ) \\gamma _ { tq}^{\\nu } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by performing integration over @xmath61 , we obtain the wave function of the bound pair @xmath62 which verifies the following equation : @xmath63 integration over @xmath64 in the right - hand side can be done with the help of the following formula :    @xmath65    thus , one has @xmath66}{e - e_{n}(k_{3}^{-})-e_{n^{% \\prime } } ( k_{3}^{+ } ) } { }   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\ \\",
