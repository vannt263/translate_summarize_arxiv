    "<S> we numerically study the superradiant instability of charged massless scalar field in the background of charged stringy black hole with mirror - like boundary condition . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the numerical result with the previous analytical result and show the dependencies of this instability upon various parameters of black hole charge @xmath0 , scalar field charge @xmath1 , and mirror radius @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> especially , we have observed that imaginary part of bqn frequencies grows with the scalar field charge @xmath1 rapidly .        </S>",
    "<S> black hole is one of the most fascinating predictions of general relativity . </S>",
    "<S> the classical black hole described by the solution of einstein field equations is a spacetime region from which gravity prevents anything , including light , from escaping . </S>",
    "<S> however , energy can be extracted from rotating black holes by impinging bosonic wave with certain frequency condition . </S>",
    "<S> this is the well - known classical effect , superradiance @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> superradiant effect may lead to instability of system combined by rotating black hole and bosonic field perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> the necessary condition of superradiant instability includes two aspects . </S>",
    "<S> one is that the black hole should be rotating . under this condition , </S>",
    "<S> bosonic wave impinging on such black hole will undergo classical superradiance process . </S>",
    "<S> the second is the existence of a potential well outside the horizon that can trap the metastable bound states . in some cases , </S>",
    "<S> the mass of bosonic field or ads boundary of black hole spacetime may provide such potential well . </S>",
    "<S> the superradiant instabilities for these cases have been extensively studied in literatures @xcite .    for a charged scalar field in the background of a charged black hole , </S>",
    "<S> if the frequency of scalar field satisfies the superradiant condition , the wave will also undergo superradiant process @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is proved by hod in @xcite that , reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) black holes are stable under the perturbations of massive charged scalar fields .    </S>",
    "<S> soon after , degollado et . </S>",
    "<S> al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite studied the system composed by rn black hole , reflecting mirror , and charged scalar field . </S>",
    "<S> this is the analogous black hole bomb firstly suggested by press and teukolsky @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism of black hole bomb seems very simple . </S>",
    "<S> if one places a reflecting mirror outside of the black hole , the wave will be bounced back and forth between the event horizon and the mirror amplifying itself each time due to superradiant effect . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , the energy of this wave can become sufficiently big in this black hole mirror system until the mirror is destroyed . in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , they found that the instability in the charged case has a shorter time scale than in the rotating case . </S>",
    "<S> this motivates us to investigate whether the other charged black holes have similar properties as rn black hole .    in @xcite , we shown that the charged stringy black hole is stable against the massive charged scalar perturbation . in @xcite , we have studied the superradiant instability of the scalar field in the background of charged stringy black hole due to a mirror - like boundary condition . </S>",
    "<S> the analytical expression of the unstable superradiant modes is derived by using the asymptotic matching method @xcite . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we will provide a numerical study of the superradiant instability for charged stringy black hole - mirror system , and compare the the numerical results with the analytical results .    </S>",
    "<S> this black hole is a the static spherical symmetric charged black holes in low energy effective theory of heterotic string theory in four dimensions , which is firstly found by gibbons and maeda in @xcite and independently found by garfinkle , horowitz , and strominger in @xcite a few years later . </S>",
    "<S> the metric is given by @xmath3 and the electric field and the dilaton field @xmath4 the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath0 are the mass and electric charge of the black hole respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the event horizon of black hole is located at @xmath6 .    in this paper , for simplicity , we only consider the charged massless scalar field perturbation in the background of charged stringy black hole </S>",
    "<S> . the dynamics of the scalar field is then governed by the klein - gordon equation @xmath7 where @xmath1 denotes the charge of the scalar field . by taking the ansatz of the scalar field @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the conserved energy of the mode , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath10 is the spherical harmonic index , and @xmath11 is the azimuthal harmonic index with @xmath12 , one can deduce the radial wave equation in the form of @xmath13 where we have introduced a new function @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and the potential function is given by @xmath17    the superradiant condition of the charged scalar field is given by @xcite @xmath18 with @xmath19 being the electric potential at the horizon . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , will impose the mirror s boundary condition that the scalar field vanishes at the mirror s location @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath20 the complex frequencies satisfying the purely ingoing boundary condition at the black hole horizon and the mirror - like boundary condition are called boxed quasinormal ( bqn ) frequencies @xcite . in the following , we will present an numerical study of bqn frequencies and compare the numerical results with the analytical results .    with the assume that the compton wavelength of scalar particle is much larger than the typical size of black hole , </S>",
    "<S> i.e. @xmath21 , we can analytically calculate the bqn frequencies of the system by employing matched asymptotic expansion method . </S>",
    "<S> the analytical expressions for the bqn frequencies are obtained in @xcite , which are given by @xmath22 where the imaginary part @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 with @xmath25    from these expression , it is easy to see that , in the superradiance regime , @xmath26-q\\phi_h<0 $ ] , the imaginary part of the complex bqn frequency @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the bqn frequencies in the superradiant regime is unstable for the charged scalar field with the mirror - like boundary condition in the background of the charged stringy black hole .    </S>",
    "<S> the numerical methods employed in this problem are based on the shooting method and numerical minimization , which is also called the direct integration ( di ) method @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the di method is specially suited to find the unstable modes , since these modes have the positive imaginary parts and therefor decay exponentially at spatial infinity . </S>",
    "<S> we can use the di method to solve the bqn frequencies directly from eq.(4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> first , near the horizon @xmath6 , we impose the ingoing boundary condition @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the tortoise coordinate defined by @xmath30 , and expand the radial function @xmath31 as a generalized power series in @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> then , we can integrate the radial equation ( 4 ) with the ingoing boundary outwards from @xmath33 and stop the integration at the radius of the mirror . in this procedure </S>",
    "<S> , we have taken the small @xmath34 as @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure can be repeated by varying the frequency @xmath9 until the mirror boundary condition @xmath36 is reached with the desired precision . </S>",
    "<S> we can use a numerical root finder to locate the zeros of the boundary condition in the complex@xmath37 plan . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained frequency is just the bqn frequency .    since our interest is to study the superradiant instability of this black hole , in which the lower order modes is expected to be stronger , we only focus on the @xmath38 mode in the following . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , we make a comparison of the numerical and analytical results . in fig . 1 and fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , we shown the imaginary and the real parts of bqn frequencies for different values of the mirror s radius @xmath2 and the charge of scalar field @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that in these figures the present imaginary part of numerical results are in good agreement with the analytical ones , while the real part is not . </S>",
    "<S> especially , from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , one can see that the numerical results match the analytical very well in the lower frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that the matching technique employed in the analytical calculation is expected to yield a better approximation in the lower frequency region .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , we fix the mass and the charge of black hole , i.e. @xmath39 , @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> we display the imaginary part of bqn frequencies as a function of mirror radius @xmath2 for different values of scalar charge @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that when the charge of scalar field decreases , the magnitude of the imaginary part of bqn frequencies decreases correspondingly . </S>",
    "<S> that is to say the instability is hard to generate for the small charge of scalar field . </S>",
    "<S> we also observe that , for the given values of @xmath41 and @xmath1 , there exists a critical radius of the mirror . </S>",
    "<S> when the radius is smaller than this critical values , there is no instability . clearly , when the charge of scalar field increases , this critical radius decreases correspondingly . </S>",
    "<S> this point has also been observed in @xcite where the analytical calculation was present . from the analytical result eq.(9 ) , one can obtain the critical radius can be approximately given by @xmath42 it should noted that this analytical expression is only valid for the case @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical results indicate that when the scalar charge @xmath1 or the black hole @xmath0 increases , the critical radius decreases , which can also be partly observed in fig.4 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the analytical expression eq.(12 ) for the critical radius can only partially explain the numerical result because eq.(12 ) is only valid in the regime @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> so , there requires an analytical calculation of bqn frequencies for other parameter regime . </S>",
    "<S> it seems to be difficult to perform such a calculation . in @xcite , the analytical calculation of bqn frequencies for the reissner - nordstrm black hole in the regime </S>",
    "<S> @xmath44 is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> it will be interesting to perform an analytical treatment of the black hole - mirror system studied in this paper in the @xmath44 regime .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 , we have drawn the imaginary parts of bqn frequencies as a function of the mirror radius @xmath2 for various values of the black hole charge @xmath0 and the scalar charge @xmath1 . from these figures </S>",
    "<S> , we firstly observe that , for the small scalar charge @xmath1 , the superradiant instability is very hard to generate . while for the large scalar charge @xmath1 , it is clear the instability is easy to generate . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion has been also obtained from fig.3 . </S>",
    "<S> form the second and third figures , we can also see that when the black hole charge @xmath0 increases the critical mirror radius which marks the boundary between the stable and unstable black hole - mirror - scalar field configurations decreases . </S>",
    "<S> this verifies the approximate expression eq.(12 ) for the critical radius .    from the previous numerical conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we expect that the combined system of black hole and scalar field may become extremely unstable for large scalar charge @xmath1 and small mirror radius @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> so we have studied the unstable modes as a function of scalar charge @xmath1 and mirror radius @xmath2 . in fig.5 </S>",
    "<S> , we have drawn the imaginary parts of bqn frequencies as a function of scalar charge @xmath1 for various values of mirror radius @xmath2 . from fig . 5 , we observe that the imaginary part of bqn frequencies grows with scalar charge @xmath1 rapidly . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests the small growth time scale of the unstable superradiant mode for the large scalar field charge . </S>",
    "<S> however , the numerical calculation of bqn frequencies for the large @xmath1 becomes difficult which is also mentioned in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have only plotted the results where @xmath1 lies in the range of @xmath45 to @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned above , the analytical treatment of bqn frequencies for this black hole - mirror system in the regime of @xmath44 may make up for deficiencies in numerical calculations . from fig . 5 </S>",
    "<S> , we can also observe that the imaginary part of bqn frequencies grows when mirror radius @xmath2 decreases .    at last , </S>",
    "<S> we make a comparison of the numerical results for charged stringy black holes with the numerical results for rn black holes in @xcite . in table </S>",
    "<S> i , we show the numerical results of bqn frequencies for the rn black hole and the charged stringy black hole . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical results of bqn frequencies for the rn black hole is adopted from the table i in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is clearly that the rn black hole - mirror system is more unstable than the charged stringy black hole - mirror system .    . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical results of rn black hole and charged stringy black hole for @xmath47 and @xmath48 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in summary , using the direct integration method , we have numerically studied the superradiant instability of charged massless scalar field with mirror - like boundary condition in the background of charged stringy black hole . by comparing the numerical results with the analytical approximation </S>",
    "<S> , we conclude the analytical calculation is only efficient in the low frequency region . </S>",
    "<S> we also show the dependencies of this instability upon the various parameters of black hole charge @xmath0 , scalar field charge @xmath1 , and the mirror radius @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> especially , we have observed that the imaginary part of bqn frequencies grows with the scalar charge rapidly . </S>",
    "<S> we have also compare the numerical results for charged stringy black holes with the numerical results for charged reissner - nordstm black holes in @xcite , and found that the reissner - nordstm black hole - mirror system is more unstable . </S>",
    "<S> at last , we should point out that the analytical treatment of bqn frequencies for the charged stingy black hole - mirror system in the regime of @xmath44 is required in the future . </S>"
