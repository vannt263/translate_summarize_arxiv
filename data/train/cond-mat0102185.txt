    "recently , it has become possible to determine experimentally @xcite the distribution function of quasiparticles , @xmath4 , in dependence of the particle energy @xmath5 in a metallic , diffusive nanowire in stationary non - equilibrium with a finite transport voltage @xmath0 applied between the ends of the wire .",
    "the measurements were done by attaching an additional superconducting tunneling electrode at a position @xmath6 along the wire , so that @xmath4 could be extracted from the tunneling current @xmath7 n_{bcs}(e+eu_t ) \\ .",
    "\\label{eq : current}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath8 is the peaked bcs density of states in the superconducting electrode , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the approximately constant density of states in the wire and the tunneling matrix element , respectively , and @xmath11 denotes the voltage between the wire and the tunneling electrode .",
    "@xmath12 is the fermi distribution at temperature @xmath13 .    as expected for a diffusive wire with elastic impurity scattering @xcite",
    ", @xmath4 has a double - step shape , corresponding to the two chemical potentials at @xmath14 and @xmath15 at the ends of the wire .",
    "in addition , the steps are rounded , indicating inelastic scattering processes in the wire . in cu @xcite and au",
    "@xcite wires , the observed rounding is such that the quasiparticle distribution obeys a remarkable scaling property when @xmath0 exceeds a certain low - energy scale , @xmath16 : @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "one may gain phenomenological insight into the nature of the inelastic relaxation processes by observing @xcite that the scaling property of @xmath4 implies that the equation of motion of @xmath4 , the quantum boltzmann equation , and consequently the inelastic single - particle collision rate @xmath18 are scale invariant as well . assuming a ( yet to be determined ) two - particle potential @xmath19 with energy transfer @xmath20 , @xmath18 is in 2nd order perturbation theory given as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a combination of distribution functions @xmath23 ensuring that there is only scattering from an occupied into an unoccupied state .",
    "the experimental finding that @xmath23 and hence @xmath18 depend only on the dimensionless energies , as indicated in eq .",
    "( [ perturb ] ) , implies that in the term on the right - hand side only dimensionless energies ( normalized to @xmath24 ) occur , i.e.  @xmath25 in the scaling regime @xmath26 .",
    "it follows that within 2nd order perturbation theory ( eq .  ( [ perturb ] ) ) the energy relaxation rate has a logarithmic energy dependence , @xmath27 , non - vanishing at the fermi energy .",
    "this anomalous behavior has raised considerable interest in the energy relaxation measurements @xcite , especially because of the possible relation of the apparently non - vanishing energy relaxation rate to the problem of dephasing saturation observed at low @xmath13 in the magnetoresistance of nanoscopic wires @xcite .",
    "the infrared singular behavior of @xmath28 , phenomenologically deduced above , means in particular that the interaction has no essential momentum dependence and should be of a local origin , in contrast to an interaction mediated by a diffusive or dispersive collective mode .",
    "therefore , it has been proposed @xcite that the anomalous energy relaxation may be induced by kondo impurities , in particular by ( nearly ) degenerate atomic two - level systems @xcite or other dynamical defects in the nanowire which can generate a two - channel kondo ( 2ck ) effect @xcite .",
    "the 2ck effect is known to have ideally a non - vanishing zeropoint entropy @xmath29 @xcite and , hence , can cause dephasing at low energies @xcite . in fact ,",
    "the electron interaction vertex mediated by a kondo impurity does show a @xmath30 energy dependence .",
    "this was noted for the 2ck effect in the strong coupling region @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] a ) ) and independently for the weak coupling ( i.e. high energy ) regime of the magnetic , single - channel kondo ( 1ck ) effect @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "although this analysis takes elevated single - particle energies into account , it assumes the kondo defect to be in thermodynamic equilibrium . since",
    ", however , the effective interaction is generated dynamically due to a fermi edge singularity , it will be substantially modified in the non - equilibrium situation of the energy relaxation measurements considered here .",
    "although the kondo effect in stationary non - equilibrium has been treated by various numerical methods before , no complete understanding has been reached up to now . in particular , the scaling properties and to what extent the kondo effect at finite bias is a strong coupling problem have remained unclear . in this article",
    "we , therefore , summarize a predominantly analytical analysis of the 1ck and the 2ck non - equilibrium kondo effect @xcite .",
    "it is shown that in nanowires with either 1ck or 2ck defects the quasiparticle distribution function exhibits scaling in terms of the applied bias , @xmath24 , when @xmath24 exceeds an intrinsic low - energy scale @xmath31 which , up to logarithmic corrections , is proportional to the equilibrium kondo temperature @xmath32 .",
    "the numerical solution of the quantum boltzmann equation gives quantitative agreement with the experimental results discussed above , where in the scaling regime the impurity concentration is the only adjustable parameter .",
    "the 1ck as well as the 2ck system can be described by a generalized su(n)@xmath33su(m ) anderson impurity model in the kondo limit , i.e.  in terms of a quantum degree of freedom in a low - lying level @xmath34 , coupled to the continuum of conduction electrons via a hybridization matrix element @xmath35 , where @xmath36 denotes the ( pseudo)spin degeneracy and @xmath37 the number of gegenerate , conserved conduction electron channels . in the auxiliary particle representation @xcite",
    "the model hamiltonian reads @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the creation operator for an electron with momentum @xmath40 .",
    "the auxiliary fermion and boson operators , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , create the local defect in its quantum state @xmath43 or in the unoccupied state , respectively .",
    "the operator constraint @xmath44 ensures that the defect is in exactly one of its quantum states at any instant of time . in the 1ck case of a magnetic anderson impurity @xmath45",
    "denotes spin , and @xmath46 has no relevance . for a 2ck defect",
    ", @xmath43 is identified with a pseudospin , e.g. the parity of the local defect wave function , and @xmath47 is the conduction electron spin acting as the conserved channel degree of freedom .",
    "note that in this case the bosonic operator @xmath42 transforms according to the conjugate representation of su(m ) in order for the channel degree of freedom to be conserved .",
    "the equilibrium kondo temperature of the model is ( to leading exponential order ) @xmath48 , with @xmath49 the effective spin exchange coupling and @xmath50 the half band width .",
    "the auxiliary particle representation allows for the application of standard green s function methods and , in particular , is readily generalized @xcite to non - equilibrium by means of the keldysh technique .",
    "it is known @xcite to describe the universal spectral properties of the multi - channel kondo effect correctly both in the infrared and in the high energy regime already within the non - crossing approximation ( nca ) , which is a selfconsistent , conserving approximation to leading order in the effective hybridization @xmath51 .",
    "thus , in the multichannel case the nca constitutes a correct infinite resummation of the logarithmic terms of perturbation theory . in the 1ck case _ at finite bias _",
    "the logarithmic series is the same as for the 2ck effect _ in equilibrium _ because of the presence of two fermi edges in the former case @xcite .",
    "thus , the nca gives a correct description both of the 1ck and of the 2ck effects in a strong non - equilibrium situation ( @xmath52 ) and will be used for the explicit calculations below .    in the remainder of this section",
    "we will consider a single kondo defect at position @xmath6 in a diffusive wire of length @xmath53 with a bias voltage @xmath0 applied between its ends .",
    "the generalization to the experimental situation of a dilute ensemble of kondo impurities will be treated in the following section .",
    "the derivations apply both to the single and to the multi - channel case . for purely elastic scattering in the wire the electronic distribution function at the position of the impurity is @xmath54 denoting the momentum integrated greater ( @xmath55 ) and lesser ( @xmath56 ) keldysh green s functions for the conduction electrons at position @xmath6 by @xmath57 @xmath58 , @xmath59 @xmath60 , and similarly the `` greater '' , `` lesser '' and retarded auxiliary particle propagators by @xmath61 , the non - equilibrium nca equations then read ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] b ) ) @xmath62 this set of non - linear equations is closed by the kramers - kroenig relations , @xmath63 , which follow from analyticity and the fact that the auxiliary particle green s functions have only forward in time propagating parts .",
    "the conduction electron t - matrix due to the kondo impurity is @xmath64    it is crucial to determine the low - energy scales of the problem in non - equilibrium .",
    "these may be determined from perturbation theory . at bias",
    "@xmath24 the kondo temperature , definied as the breakdown scale of perturbation theory , is suppressed , e.g. in the middle of the wire ( @xmath65 ) , as @xmath66 in addition , a korringa - like spin relaxation rate @xmath67 appears , because in non - equilibrium there is finite phase space available for scattering even at @xmath68 , @xmath69 because of this inelastic relaxation rate , the logarithmic singularities of perturbation theory ( @xmath68 ) are shifted by @xmath70 to the complex frequency plane , and the kondo scale disappears eventually for large bias @xmath24 and is replaced by the inelastic rate @xmath71 : the low - temperature scale is @xmath72 $ ] .",
    "the crossover from the kondo to the korringa scale occurs at a bias @xmath73 this means that in the large bias regime , @xmath74 , the low - energy scale of the problem is proportional to the external bias itself .",
    "we now turn to the scaling analysis of the non - equilibrium kondo equations ( [ nca1])([tmatrix ] ) .",
    "it is well known @xcite , that at @xmath68 in equilibrium the exact auxiliary particle propagators exhibit infrared powerlaw divergencies @xmath75 , where the exponents @xmath76 are due to an orthogonality catastrophy between the occupied and the unoccupied impurity state . in the 2ck case",
    "the exact exponents are reproduced by nca @xcite and depend in a characteristic way on the spin degeneracy @xmath77 and the channel number @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 with @xmath81 . in the large bias regime ( @xmath82 )",
    ", the nca equations are valid both in the 1ck and in the 2ck case , as mentioned above .",
    "the behavior around the fermi edges may be determined by defining the complex frequency variables @xmath83 etc .  and rewriting the nca equations for @xmath84 and @xmath85 as coupled differential equations in analogy to the equilibrium case @xcite .",
    "we obtain damped powerlaw behavior of the auxiliary fermion propagator for energies @xmath86 and of the auxiliary boson propagator for energies around the two fermi edges @xmath86 , @xmath87 where the damping constant is @xmath71 .",
    "the exponents are modified in the large bias regime to @xmath88 , @xmath89 , where the additional factor of 2 originates from the fact that there are two separated fermi edges .",
    "the form of @xmath90 , @xmath91 is reminiscent of an effective doubling of the channel number @xmath78 induced by the two fermi edges .",
    "this behavior is confirmed by the numerical evaluation of the problem and is consistent with a recent perturbative renormalization group analysis @xcite of the problem .",
    "the fact that powerlaw behavior ( although damped ) instead of logarithmic behavior persists even at large bias may be seen as a remnant of the strong coupling behavior of the kondo problem in non - equilibrium .",
    "it is crucial for scaling in terms of @xmath24 to occur : putting the powerlaw behavior of the auxiliary propagators back into eqs .",
    "( [ nca1])([tmatrix ] ) , using @xmath92 and the important fact that the low - energy scale @xmath93 and the damping rate of the powerlaw behavior themselves scale with the external bias , @xmath94 , it follows immediately that these equations depend only on dimensionless energies @xmath95 , @xmath96 etc . , i.e. they are scale invariant in the regime @xmath97 ( eq .",
    "[ eq : ucross ] ) .",
    "it is seen that in experiments one may extract the equilibrium kondo temperature @xmath98 from the lower breakdown scale of the scaling behavior .",
    "=    the remaining task is to calculate the electronic non - equilibrium distribution function @xmath4 explicitly at an arbitrary position @xmath6 along the wire in the presence of a dilute but finite density of 1ck or 2ck defects @xmath99 .    the boltzmann quantum kinetic equation for the momentum @xmath40 dependent `` greater '' conduction electron green s function @xmath100 , which contains information about the distribution function , reads @xcite @xmath101 g_{c , ( x , t)}^{+ } ( e,\\vec p ) =   { \\cal c } \\bigl ( \\ { g_{c,(x , t)}^{+}(e,\\vec p ) \\ } , c_{imp } \\bigr ) , \\nonumber\\\\ \\label{boltz } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath102 is the collision integral induced by inelastic scattering off kondo defects and @xmath103 are the external electric fields , including those generated by static , random impurities in the wire .",

    "( [ boltz ] ) over quasiparticle momenta @xmath40 , the electric field term drops out as a surface term , and we obtain in the stationary case a diffusive kinetic equation @xcite for the impurity averaged distribution function @xmath106 @xmath107 as function of the quasiparticle energy @xmath5 and position @xmath6 , @xmath108 after momentum integration , the collision integral is given in terms of the impurity t - matrix ( eq .  [ tmatrix ] ) to arbitrary order in the electron - impurity coupling @xmath109 by @xmath110 \\ .",

    "the theoretical @xmath114 curves show scaling behavior in the regime @xmath115 ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : ucross ] ) ) for bias voltages @xmath0 varying within a factor of 4 to 9 , depending on the high energy parameters of the model eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "there is excellent quantitative agreement between theory and experiment for all samples .",
    "the experimental data for cu and au wires can be fitted equally well by the 1ck or by the 2ck theory , with very similar defect concentrations in the two cases . as an example , fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the fits of the cu data to the 2ck theory and of the au data to the 1ck theory only .",
    "the agreement is consistent with the conjecture that the anomalous energy relaxation in those wires is mediated either by 1ck or by 2ck defects .",
    "for an ideal 2ck system in equilibrium , the non - vanishing quasiparticle scattering rate @xmath116 crosses over to a pure dephasing rate @xmath117 , as the quasiparticle energy approaches the fermi energy , @xmath118 @xcite .",
    "however , because of the finite level splitting @xmath119 in real systems , one expects an upturn of @xmath120 at the lowest @xmath121 , with an intermediate plateau for @xmath122 @xcite .",
    "such behavior can also be expected from magnetic ( 1ck ) kondo impurities in combination with a phonon contribution , because the spin flip rate reaches a maximum at @xmath123 @xcite .",
    "this has been observed in the kondo system aufe @xcite and most recently in clean au wires presumably containing a small concentration of fe impurities @xcite .",
    "one might , therefore , conjecture that 1ck or 2ck defects could be the origin of the dephasing time saturation observed in magnetotransport measurements of weak localization @xcite .",
    "this assumption is indeed supported by several coincidences between the dephasing time measurements and the results on the non - equilibrium distribution function : ( 1 ) the dephasing time @xmath124 extracted from magnetotransport experiments @xcite is strongly material , sample , and preparation dependent .",
    "this suggests a non - universal dephasing mechanism , like dynamical defects , which is not inherent to the electron gas .",
    "( 2 ) the dephasing time in au wires is generically shorter than in cu wires @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the estimates for the dynamical impurity concentration @xmath99 , obtained from the fit of the present theory to the experimental distribution functions , is substantially higher in au than in cu wires ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "( 3 ) in ag wires one observes neither dephasing saturation nor @xmath96 scaling of the distribution function @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the assumption that dephasing saturation and anomalous energy relaxation in the nanoscopic wires have the same origin and that there are no kondo defects present in the ag samples .",
    "we have analysed the single- as well as the two - channel kondo effect in a stationary non - equilibrium situation .",
    "it was found that a korringa - like , inelastic spin relaxation rate appears which at large bias sets the low - energy scale of the problem .",
    "nevertheless , a remnant of the strong coupling kondo fixed point persist even at large bias , which manifests itself by damped powerlaw behavior of the local spectral density .",
    "the latter leads to scaling of the non - equilibrium distribution function @xmath125 as an experimentally observable signature . the present theory yields quantitative agreement with the experimental results for all samples measured , the density of kondo defects in the wire being the only adjustable parameter in the scaling regime",
    "this strongly suggests that the anomalous energy relaxation might be caused by either 1ck or 2ck defects .",
    "however , it was shown that the scaling property of the distribution function does not distinguish between 1ck or 2ck impurities .",
    "further experimental tests , like application of a magnetic field , will be required for that purpose .",
