    "each of these keplerian motions can be parameterized by keplerian elements @xmath36the time of pericenter , semi - major axis , eccentricity , inclination , argument of pericenter and the longitude of ascending node , respectively .",

    "however , it is extremely complicated . on the other hand ,",
    "in fact we do not need analytical formulae such as those presented in @xcite .",
    "thus the most suitable approach is to solve this problem numerically . in order to do",

    "as we show in section 7 , this approach gives very accurate results , much more accurate than any reasonable analytical treatment . from the form of equations ( [ osc ] )",

    "the initial values of osculating orbital elements replace the keplerian elements as parameters of the model and we additionally have the parameters , @xmath114 and @xmath115 , related to the masses of @xmath2 and @xmath1 . we also need the derivatives of @xmath39 with respect to the parameters @xmath116 . with sufficient accuracy the derivatives with respect to @xmath117 can be computed from the keplerian part @xmath118 of the model only and the derivatives with respect to @xmath114 and @xmath115 can be easily obtained as @xmath119 and @xmath120 are proportional to them @xmath121 now , determination of masses of @xmath2 and @xmath1 and inclinations @xmath122 and @xmath123 can be carried out in the following way .",
    "first , we assume that the mass of the pulsar @xmath4 is canonical ( i.e. @xmath124m@xmath125 ) and derive @xmath126 , @xmath127 directly from @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "subsequently inclinations can be computed from the following equations @xmath128 where @xmath129 .",
    "we start the tests with the comparison of our approach for computing osculating elements with that of @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the most significant component of the non - keplerian motion comes from the changes of mean longitude @xmath130 .",
    "therefore in fig .",
    "2 we present @xmath131 for the case of coplanar , edge - on orbits . as we can see , the approach developed in this paper is in fact as good as the integration of full equations of motion . for other elements we obtain very similar results .",
    "it should be mentioned that because the model of @xcite is not accurate enough in predicting the secular change of @xmath131 and because @xmath131 are proportional to @xmath114 and @xmath115 , using such model would result in a significant error in determination of the planets masses .",
    "next , we compared the toa residuals due to the non - keplerian part of the motion calculated from our model with those obtained by means of numerical integration of full equations of motion . in fig .",
    "3 , as one can see , for small relative inclinations ( fig .",
    "3 ( a ) and ( b ) ) our model is very accurate . for larger @xmath81 ( fig .",
    "3 ( c ) and ( d ) ) one can see small differences but this is consistent with the assumptions made to obtain the model .",
    "finally , we performed the tests which show how the derived timing model can be used to obtain the masses of planets . to this end",
    "we used the tempo software package ( see the internet location http://pulsar.princeton.edu/tempo ) modified to include our model of the non - keplerian motion of psr  b1257 + 12 .",
    "we simulated two different sets of artificial toas assuming the parameters of psr  b1257 + 12 @xcite .",
    "the first set of toas sampled every day covered a period of 10 years .",
    "we also added gaussian noise with @xmath132 .",
    "the second set was prepared to resemble the real timing observations of psr b1257 + 12 . under such conditions we simulated toas for the cases described in fig .",
    "subsequently , we applied the modified tempo to obtain the masses of planets @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the results are presented in table 1 .",
    "the tests performed on set 1 were used to establish a limit on applicability of our model .",
    "as one can see , for the relative inclinations @xmath81 of about 10 degrees the model becomes inaccurate and the relative error of determination of masses is at the level of 20@xmath133 . because the relative inclination weakens the interactions of planets , using the model which assumes a small @xmath81 , results , in such situations , in the determined masses that are smaller than the real ones . from the tests performed on set 2 we also learn that this error is bigger than uncertainty originating in toa measurement errors .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath81 is relatively small we obtain a very accurate determination of masses thus proving that our model can be successfully applied as long as the assumptions made to derive it are satisfied .    to sum up",
    ", our model can be applied in all the cases when the ` observational ' uncertainties of the planets masses are bigger than the uncertainties resulting from the assumptions made to derive the timing model .",
    "this , in general , depends on masses of planets and the relative inclination of the orbits @xmath81 as well as the characteristic of the observations but one can estimate that in the case of the psr  b1257 + 12 data @xmath81 should be smaller than 10 degrees .",
    "we should also mention that for non - coplanar orbits the angle @xmath106 will be in general different from zero therefore we have to find it in order to get the proper values of the planets masses .",
    "it can be done by computing the least - squares value of @xmath134 for a range of @xmath106 and then choosing the @xmath106 that corresponds to the minimum of @xmath134 . and eventually , one has to remember that the psr  b1257 + 12 planetary system could be in such configuration that a more significant alteration must be done to our model .",
    "first of all , the relative inclination of the orbits could be large .",
    "in such case one would have to use the full form of the perturbative hamiltonian @xmath86 which would lead to a much more complicated model with four additional parameters @xmath135 ( instead of one @xmath106 ) .",
    "secondly , the presence of a massive distant planet , if significant for the theory of motion , would have to be taken into account .",
