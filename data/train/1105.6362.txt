    "present - day cosmology is inflowing into an era where it is becoming more and more possible to constrain the models of the early universe by precise data coming from highly sophisticated observational probes like wmap @xcite , planck @xcite , sdss @xcite , acbar @xcite , quad @xcite .",
    "such observations are gradually leading theoretical cosmology towards the details of physics at very high energies , and the possibility of testing some of the speculative ideas of recent years . inflation ",
    "the most fascinating among them  was first proposed back in 1981 by guth @xcite , and has since been developed by a wide variety of probable models @xcite . however , the inflationary scenario is more like a paradigm than a theory , since a specific compelling model is yet to be separated out from the spectrum of possible models and alternatives .",
    "so far the most appealing prediction of inflationary paradigm was that it may generate spectra of both density perturbations and gravitational waves . before the detection of cmb anisotropies by cobe @xcite ,",
    "cosmological observations had limited range of scales to access , and it was sufficient to predict from an inflationary scenario a scale - invariant spectrum of density perturbations and a negligible amplitude of gravitational waves . however , since cobe @xcite and , of late , wmap @xcite came forward , the spectra are now well - constrained over a wide range of scales ranging from 1 mpc upto 10,000 mpc .",
    "so the inflationary predictions should now be very precise to incorporate latest observations , say , from wmap seven year run . the ongoing satellite mission planck @xcite will restrict the theoretical predictions further .",
    "it promises to survey the ratio of the tensor to scalar amplitudes @xmath0 upto the order of @xmath1 @xcite ( orders below wmap @xcite predictions @xmath2 at 95% confidence level [ c.l . ]",
    "@xcite ) so as to comment more precisely on primordial gravitational waves and the energy scale of inflation .",
    "planck may even discriminate single field inflationary models from multi - field models by detecting ( provided @xmath3 ) large _ non gaussianity_. so this is high time to confront different class of inflationary models with latest data and forthcoming predictions .",
    "the usual technique used in the inflationary scenario to solve the dynamical equations is the _ slow roll approximations _ @xcite .",
    "but it is not the only possibility for successfully implementing models of inflation and solutions outside the _ slow roll approximations _ have been found @xcite . to incorporate all the models irrespective of slow roll approximations _",
    "hamilton jacobi _",
    "formalism @xcite turned out to be very useful .",
    "the formulation is imitative by considering the _ inflaton _ field itself to be the evolution parameter .",
    "the key advantage of this formalism is that here we only need the _ hubble parameter _",
    "@xmath4 to be specified rather than the inflaton potential @xmath5 . since @xmath6 is a geometric quantity , unlike @xmath7 , inflation is more naturally described in this language @xcite .",
    "further , being first order in nature , these equations are easily tractable to explore the underlying physics .",
    "once @xmath4 has been specified , one can , in principle , derive a relation between @xmath8 and @xmath9 which will enable him to get hold of @xmath10 and the scale factor @xmath11 therefrom . therefore _",
    "hamilton jacobi _ formalism provides us with a straightforward way of exploring inflationary scenario and related observational aspects .",
    "in this article , we intend to confront quasi - exponential inflationary models with wmap seven years data @xcite with a phenomenological hubble parameter following _ hamilton jacobi _ formalism .",
    "the absence of time dependence in the hubble parameter produces de - sitter inflation which was very appealing from theoretical point of view but its acceptability is more or less limited considering present day observations .",
    "so , certain deviation from an exact exponential inflation turns out to be a good move so as to go along with latest as well as forthcoming data . in general",
    "these models are called quasi - exponential inflation .",
    "our primary intention here is to confront this quasi - exponential inflation with wmap seven using the publicly available code camb @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , as it will turn out , the analysis also predicts a detectable tensor to scalar ratio so as to reflect significant features of quasi - exponential inflation in forthcoming planck @xcite data sets as well .",
    "thus , planck may directly verify ( or put further constraint to ) our analysis by detecting ( or pushing further below the upper bound of ) gravitational waves .",
    "the _ hamilton jacobi _ formalism allows us to express the friedmann equation in terms of a first order differential equation @xcite [ hamilton ] ^2 - h()^2=-v ( ) and the evolution of the scalar field [ phidot ] = -2m_p^2 h ( ) where a prime denotes a derivative with respect to the scalar field @xmath8 and a dot a time derivative .",
    "the above two equations govern the inflationary dynamics in hamilton jacobi formalism .",
    "the shape of the associated potential can be obtained by rearranging terms of eqn.([hamilton ] ) to give [ potential ] v()=3m_p^2h^2 ( ) where @xmath12 has been defined as [ epsilon ] _",
    "h=2m_p^2 ( ) ^2 we further have [ adot ] = h()^2 so @xmath13 implies accelerated expansion .",
    "it is customary to define another parameter by @xmath14 it is worthwhile to mention here that the parameters @xmath12 and @xmath15 are not the usual slow roll parameters .",
    "but in the slow roll limit @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xcite , @xmath18 and @xmath19 being usual _ slow roll _ parameters .",
    "let us consider a phenomenological hubble parameter representing quasi exponential inflation [ hubble ] h()=h_inf where @xmath20 is a dimensionless parameter and @xmath21 is a constant having dimension of planck mass .",
    "the value of the constants can be fixed from the conditions for successful inflation and the observational bounds . as it will turn out in subsequent analysis this hubble parameter",
    "can indeed be cast into a form of quasi exponential inflation for some choice in the parameter space .",
    "the two parameters @xmath12 and @xmath15 in the hamilton jacobi formalism take the form @xmath22     variation of the fourth root of the potential with the scalar field , width=321,height=207 ]    now , the condition for inflation may be put forward using equation of state parameter which has the form [ eqnstate ] ( ) = -1     variation of the equation of state parameter with the scalar field @xmath8 , the horizontal line represents @xmath23,width=321,height=207 ]    from the constraint @xmath24 during inflation , we get [ plower ] |p| > so for almost any value of @xmath20 inflation is achievable .",
    "however , at the end of inflation @xmath25 allows us to estimate an upper bound for @xmath20 as [ pupper ] |p| where @xmath26 is the value of the inflaton field at the end of inflation . in order to implement a successful model of inflation both",
    "the restrictions on @xmath27 should be satisfied",
    ". first note that if @xmath20 is negative then from eqn.([phidot ] ) and eqn.([hubble ] ) we have @xmath28 , i.e. @xmath29 increases with time which incorporates the so called _ graceful exit problem _ @xcite .",
    "we discard the values of @xmath20 greater or equal to @xmath30 as well , since @xmath31 would imply @xmath32 for any value of @xmath8 giving rise to the same problem . as a result",
    "the feasible range for @xmath20 would be : @xmath33 .",
    "further , for sufficient inflation we also need @xmath34 during inflation . and violation of that condition after inflation drags the inflaton towards its potential minima quickly .",
    "but if @xmath35 then @xmath36 will always be less than one . imposing this condition",
    "further restricts the range of the otherwise free parameter @xmath20 within @xmath37 .",
    "we shall use a representative value for the parameter @xmath20 within the above range later on in this paper while confronting camb @xcite outputs with wmap seven @xcite .    now to derive the expression for the scale factor we shall make use of the relation [ sc ] & = & h ( ) plugging eqn.([hubble ] ) into eqn.([phidot ] ) and using eqn.([sc ] ) we have [ aphi ] a()=a_ewhere @xmath38 $ ] , @xmath39 being the scale factor at the end of inflation .",
    ".different parameters for different values of @xmath20 within its allowed range [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      variation of matter power spectrum @xmath40 with @xmath41 in logarithmic scales for quasi - exponential inflation and the best fit spectra of wmap7 for @xmath42cdm + tens , width=321,height=207 ]    the curvature perturbation is generated due to the fluctuations in the _ inflaton _ and remains almost constant on the _ super hubble _ scales .",
    "long after the end of inflation it makes horizon reentry creating matter density fluctuations through the gravitational attraction of the potential wells .",
    "these matter density fluctuations grew with time forming the structure in the universe .",
    "so the measurement of the matter power spectrum is very crucial as it is directly related to the formation of structure . in fig.[matpow ] the camb output for the variation of the spectrum of the matter density fluctuations with the scale for quasi - exponential inflation and the best fit spectra of wmap7 for @xmath42cdm + tens @xcite have been shown and it represents true behavior indeed @xcite .",
    "variation of cmb angular power spectrum @xmath43 for quasi - exponential inflation , the best fit spectra of wmap7 for @xmath42cdm + tens and wmap7 data with the multipoles @xmath44,width=321,height=207 ]    in fig.[tt ] we confront camb output of cmb angular power spectrum @xmath43 for quasi - exponential inflation with wmap seven years data and the best fit spectra of wmap7 for @xmath42cdm + tens . on the large angular scales i.e. for low @xmath44 ,",
    "cmb anisotropy spectrum is dominated by the fluctuations in the gravitational potential leading to _ sachs - wolfe _ effect . from fig.[tt ] we see that the sachs - wolfe plateau obtained from quasi - exponential inflation is almost flat confirming a nearly scale invariant spectrum and resonating with the small spectral tilt @xmath45 as estimated from our analysis .    for larger",
    "@xmath44 , cmb anisotropy spectrum is dominated by the acoustic oscillations of the baryon - photon fluid giving rise to several peaks and troughs in the spectrum .",
    "the heights of the peaks are very susceptible to the baryon fraction .",
    "also the peak positions are sensitive to the curvature of the space and on the rate of cosmological expansion hence on the dark energy and other forms of the matter . in fig.[tt ] the first and most prominent peak arises at @xmath46 at a height of @xmath47 followed by two equal height peaks at @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with wmap seven years data @xcite for @xmath42cdm background .",
    "the direct comparison of our prediction for @xmath50 in fig.[tt ] shows fine match with wmap data apart from the two outliers at @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the above analysis is for a representative value of the parameter @xmath53 witin its allowed range .",
    "variation of cmb tensor @xmath43 angular power spectrum for quasi - exponential inflation and the predicted tensor spectra of wmap7 for @xmath42cdm + tens with the multipoles @xmath44,width=321,height=207 ]    the gravitational waves generated during inflation also remain constant on _ super hubble _ scales having small amplitudes .",
    "but as its wavelength becomes smaller than horizon the amplitude begins to die off very rapidly .",
    "so the small scale modes have no impact in the cmb anisotropy spectrum only the large scale modes have little contribution and this is obvious from fig.[ttt ] .",
    "variation of cmb angular power spectrum @xmath54 for quasi - exponential inflation and the best fit spectra of wmap7 for @xmath42cdm + tens with the multipoles @xmath44,width=321,height=207 ]     variation of cmb angular power spectrum @xmath55 for quasi - exponential inflation and the best fit spectra of wmap7 for @xmath42cdm + tens with the multipoles @xmath44,width=321,height=207 ]    further , in fig.[te ] and fig.[ee ] we have plotted cmb te and ee angular power spectrum respectively for quasi - exponential inflation and the best fit spectra of wmap7 for @xmath42cdm + tens and compared with wmap seven years data . both the plots resonate fairly well with the latest wmap data @xcite .",
    "thus , from the entire analysis , it turns out that quasi - exponential inflation confronts extremely well with wmap seven dataset .",
    "we expect that the forthcoming data from planck would constrain quasi - exponential inflation further .",
    "in this article we have confronted quasi - exponential models of inflation with wmap seven year dataset using hamilton - jacobi formalism .",
    "we have first developed the formalism with a phenomenological hubble parameter and have demonstrated how and to what extent the scenario measures deviation from standard exponential inflation ( _ e.g. _ , de - sitter model ) .",
    "the deviation , incorporated through a new parameter @xmath20 , has then been constrained by estimating the major observable parameters from the model and confronting them with wmap seven year dataset .",
    "the observable parameters , as obtained from our analysis , turn out to be in good fit with the latest wmap data .    we have further utilized the publicly available code camb @xcite to compare with wmap seven data @xcite the matter power spectrum as well as cmb angular power spectra for the tt , te and ee modes obtained from our analysis .",
    "this allows us to put stringent constrains on the model parameters .",
    "camb outputs for a emblematic value of the parameter @xmath20 within its allowed range @xmath37 are in excellent agreement with the latest wmap data .",
    "values of the most significant cosmological parameters have also been calculated using camb and have found to fair well with the observational bounds as given by wmap seven years data .",
    "this leads us to conclude that quasi - exponential inflation confronts extremely well with wmap seven within a certain parameter space .    nevertheless , another appealing aspect of our analysis is the possibility of verifying quasi - exponential inflation by planck .",
    "the current observational bound on the ratio of tensor to scalar amplitudes as given by wmap is @xmath2 at 95% c.l .",
    "@xcite . with the ongoing satellite experiment planck promising to detect it down to the order of @xmath1 @xcite in near future , this parameter is now playing a pivotal role ( along with non - gaussianity ) to discriminate among different models .",
    "the numerical estimation reveals that the parameter @xmath0 is of the order of @xmath1 for quasi - exponential inflation .",
    "thus , the forthcoming data from planck can be confronted directly with quasi - exponential inflation .",
    "we are looking forward to confront this type of inflation with planck and to have more exciting results in near future .",
    "we also plan to engage ourselves in estimating cosmological parameters using another highly useful code cosmomc @xcite .",
    "results in this direction will be reported shortly .",
