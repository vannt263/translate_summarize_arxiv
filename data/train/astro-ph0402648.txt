    "we describe one such unusual quasar , sdss j113658.36 + 024220.1 ( hereafter sdss j1136 + 0242 ) , which exhibits strong ly@xmath1  emission but no detected metal - line emission .",
    "we discuss its unusual properties (  [ spec ] ) , consider possible explanations for them (  [ wassup ] ) , and conclude with suggestions for further investigation (  [ con ] ) . where needed",

    "besides the sdss imaging and spectroscopy , near - ir photometry was obtained on ut 2003 january 31 using the infrared side port imager ( ispi ; 2003 ) on the ctio 4-meter telescope , with total exposure times of 800 seconds in @xmath11 and 300 seconds in @xmath12 .",

    "sdss j1136 + 0242  was targeted for spectroscopy in the sdss as a serendipity target ( a category including first sources fainter than @xmath20 ; 2002 ) and as a high redshift quasar candidate .",
    "the sdss spectrum ( fig . [ f_full ] ) has a median signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) per pixel ranging from 4 in the @xmath21 band to 7 in the @xmath16 band .",
    "it shows a single , moderately broad ly@xmath1  emission line ( fwhm@xmath21430 kms@xmath3 ) with accompanying ly@xmath1  and civ  absorption at three distinct redshifts within a velocity range of 2710 kms@xmath3 .",
    "the curvature in the continuum between ly@xmath1  and @xmath41280    is almost certainly due to two - photon emission from the @xmath22 state of hi  ( see  [ 2q ] ) .",
    "the spectrum is well fit by the sum of two - photon emission and a power - law with @xmath23 ( dashed lines ; reduced chi - squared is @xmath24 , neglecting systematic errors in the spectrophotometry ) .",

    "in fact , less than 0.5% of sdss quasars in the study of ( 2003 ) have such red continua .    to determine the systemic redshift of sdss j1136 + 0242 , we simultaneously fitted for the ly@xmath1  emission redshift , the ly@xmath1  absorption redshifts , and the civ  absorption redshifts using iraf .",
    "we assumed a single gaussian profile for each component .",
    "each line s width , height and center was allowed to vary independently .",
    "the ly@xmath1  absorption redshifts very closely matched the civ  absorption redshifts ( fig .",
    "[ f_zoom ] ) , demonstrating that the ly@xmath1  emission does not bias the determination of the ly@xmath1  absorption systems parameters .",
    "the best - fit ly@xmath1  emission redshift was identical to that of the highest redshift absorption system to within the errors .",
    "we therefore adopted the redshift of this system , @xmath29 , as the systemic redshift .",
    "( the other associated absorption systems are at @xmath30 and @xmath31 . )    to place limits on emission line fluxes , we simultaneously fitted all broad emission and narrow absorption features listed in table [ t_spec ] to the rest - frame spectrum .",
    "the spectrum was first normalized by a single third - order spline fit to rest - frame spectral regions at 10902460    free of strong emission lines seen in normal quasars ( inferred from table 2 of 2001 ) .",
    "narrow absorption lines were allowed to vary in central wavelength , depth , and width , except as noted . because of the obvious weakness of any emission lines besides ly@xmath1 , all broad emission lines were constrained to have the same width as ly@xmath1 . for nv  and civ  doublet emission",
    ", we fit a single gaussian whose fwhm was the quadrature sum of the ly@xmath1  fwhm and the separation between the two doublet lines .",
    "two fits to the emission lines were made : one where the central wavelength @xmath32 was allowed to vary because agn emission lines often exhibit velocity shifts ( richards et  al .",
    "2002b ) , and one where @xmath32 was held fixed at the @xmath33 values from table 2 of ( 2001 ) .",
    "we refer to those fits as the _ variable-@xmath32 _ and _ fixed-@xmath32 _ fits , respectively .",
    "only the variable-@xmath32 fit results are listed in table [ t_spec ] , but line ratios for both fits are listed in table [ t_ratio ] ( see appendix [ blagn ] ) .    as seen in table [ t_spec ] ,",
    "a few emission lines are nominally detected with rest - frame equivalent width ( rew ) values which are non - zero at @xmath34 significance .",
    "these @xmath35 values do not include the uncertainties in the continuum fit , and so may be underestimates ; however , we have also ignored the fact that the errors in the fwhm and the peak value are correlated , which will make the @xmath35 values overestimates . the differences between the fluxes from the variable-@xmath32 and fixed-@xmath32 fits are illustrative of the systematic uncertainties .    because there is civ  absorption at the systemic redshift , the fit to the civ  emission line depends on the fit to the absorption",
    ". an unconstrained fit to the civ  spectral region yields considerable broad emission which is masked by relatively broad absorption ( fwhm of 574 kms@xmath3 ) . while we can not completely rule out such a fit , we adopt a more plausible fit where the civ  absorption lines are constrained to have the same fhwm as the ly@xmath1  absorption at the same redshift ( 431 kms@xmath3 ) .",
    "even that width is probably an overestimate for the civ  absorption , as the other two associated systems have civ  widths only 20@xmath3640% as broad as ly@xmath1 .",
    "nonetheless , this fit is conservative in the sense that narrower widths would further reduce the allowable civ  emission strength , moving this object even further from the norm for quasars .      the curvature in the continuum of sdss j1136 + 0242   between ly@xmath1  and @xmath41280    matches the characteristic spectral shape of forbidden two - photon emission from the @xmath22 state of hydrogen ( aller 1984 ; osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "the spectrum is well fit by the sum of two - photon emission and a power - law with @xmath37 , and the sdss photometry from the same epoch as the spectroscopy is also consistent with such a spectrum . ) . ]",
    "the @xmath38 color corresponds to a power - law spectrum of index @xmath39 , consistent within the uncertainties with an extrapolation of the value of @xmath40 that fits the sdss spectrum .",
    "the @xmath11 and @xmath12 magnitudes are fainter than an extrapolation of such a power - law ; however , given the likelihood of flux variability between the optical and near - ir imaging epochs ( table  [ t_info ] ) , all the observations appear consistent with a spectrum which is the sum of two - photon emission and a rather red power - law .",
    "it is important to remember that hi  two - photon emission only occurs for electron densities @xmath41  @xmath42 . above that density , collisions from the @xmath22 state of hydrogen to the @xmath43 state lead to ly@xmath1  emission ( @xmath43@xmath44@xmath45 ) instead of two - photon emission ( @xmath22@xmath44@xmath45 ) .",
    "thus , we are not seeing emission from gas with typical quasar broad - line region ( blr ) densities ( @xmath46  @xmath42 ) .",
    "@xmath42 but with unusual parameters that suppress emission from lines other than ly@xmath1",
    ". we relegate further discussion of this rather unlikely possibility to appendix [ blagn ] , and assume we have in fact detected two - photon emission throughout the rest of the main text . ]",
    "the ratio of the integrated two - photon continuum flux to the ly@xmath1  line flux ( corrected for narrow ly@xmath1  absorption ) in sdss j1136 + 0242  is @xmath47 .",
    "the intrinsic value of this ratio is @xmath48 for @xmath49 ( osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "therefore , the ly@xmath1  emission flux in this object must have been reduced by a factor of at least @xmath50 .",
    "the only plausible destruction mechanism is absorption by dust within the ly@xmath1  emission region , where resonant scattering of ly@xmath1  will increase its optical depth relative to the two - photon continuum .",
    "( colisional deexcitation or bound - free ionization of the @xmath51 level of hydrogen would affect ly@xmath1  and two - photon emission equally . )    assuming the uv continuum is extincted by the ly@xmath1-emitting gas , the maximum plausible extinction corresponds to a color excess of @xmath52 , using the small magellanic cloud extinction curve of ( 1992 ) . that extinction is the amount required to turn the @xmath25@xmath28 spectral slope of a typical sdss quasar ( 2001 ) into the estimated underlying uv spectral slope of @xmath25@xmath53 in sdss j1136 + 0242 .",
    "extinction by @xmath52 would reduce @xmath54 by a factor of 1.9  the ly@xmath1  flux would be reduced by a factor of 2.7 and the two - photon continuum by a factor of 1.4 in total . from a slab with total optical depth @xmath55 at that wavelength will be reduced by a factor of @xmath56 from the @xmath57 case . ]",
    "the additional required reduction of ly@xmath1   corresponds to an optical depth to scattering only 5.1 times greater in ly@xmath1  than in the adjacent continuum , which is easily achieved ( korista & ferland 1998 ) .",
    "however , while a reddened normal quasar spectrum plus reddened two - photon emission is an acceptable fit to the spectrum longward of ly@xmath1 ( @xmath58 ) and to the @xmath11-band flux , it underpredicts the @xmath12-band flux ( rest - frame 6200   ) by a factor of two .",
    "sdss j1136 + 0242  is too luminous for this discrepancy to be explained by host galaxy emission , and the relative contributions of the balmer continuum in the observed @xmath11 band and the paschen continuum in the observed @xmath12 band will make the @xmath38 color bluer , not redder , for all reasonable power - law indices ( fig .",
    "4.1 of 1989 ) .",
    "in this section we consider possible explanations for the unusual properties of sdss j1136 + 0242 .",
    "one discounted possibility is that this object is a gravitationally lensed lyman - break galaxy ( see appendix [ lens ] ) .",
    "we first summarize our conclusions regarding the spectrum of sdss j1136 + 0242  so far .",
    "a low - metallicity but dusty ( @xmath59 ) narrow - line region with @xmath60  @xmath42 is responsible for the weak ly@xmath1  emission and strong two - photon continuum which contributes @xmath6130% of the continuum flux at 1500   .",
    "the underlying uv - optical continuum is well fit as a power - law with @xmath37 , much steeper than usual for agn , though an intrinsically bluer power - law plus reddening can not be entirely ruled out .",
    "the emission - line flux of civ  is @xmath625% of the ly@xmath1  flux , compared to typical values of @xmath425% in quasars ( vanden berk et  al .",
    "2001 ) and @xmath415% in powerful radio galaxies ( de breuck et  al .",
    "the ly@xmath1  linewidth is intermediate between these two classes of objects .",
    "the continuum is at best very weakly polarized .",
    "stellar emission can not contribute significantly to the continuum for the same reasons the lensed lyman - break galaxy hypothesis was rejected ( see appendix [ lens ] ) .",
    "we appear to be observing a featureless , power - law uv spectrum plus ly@xmath1  and hi  two - photon emission from dusty gas",
    ".      it may be reasonable to think of sdss j1136 + 0242  as the spectrum of a radio galaxy plus a featureless continuum .",
    "the radio power of sdss j1136 + 0242  is @xmath63 erg s@xmath3 hz@xmath3 , assuming @xmath64 near 1.4 ghz ( de breuck et  al .",
    "this radio power is within an order of magnitude of those of the powerful @xmath65 radio galaxies studied by ( 2000 ) .",
    "sdss j1136 + 0242   is radio - loud as defined by ( 2002 ) , with a logarithmic radio - optical flux ratio @xmath66 sufficient to place it at or above the traditional @xmath67 division even in the presence of reddening with @xmath52 .",
    "the ly@xmath1/civ  flux ratio of sdss j1136 + 0242  would be extreme , but not unprecedented , for a narrow - line radio galaxy .",
    "the studies of ( 2000 , 2001 ) include four objects out of @xmath450 with larger ly@xmath1/civ  flux ratios .",
    "their ly@xmath1  emission is usually spatially extended , but the ly@xmath1  emission of sdss j1136 + 0242  could also be extended since sdss spectra are obtained through 3  diameter fibers .",
    "the most likely explanation for the small civ / ly@xmath1  ratio in those objects , and in sdss j1136 + 0242  if this model is correct , is a low metallicity of 0.1@xmath68 or less in the line - emitting gas ( fig .",
    "17 and  5.6 of 2000 ) .",
    "the ly@xmath1  emission fwhm of sdss j1136 + 0242  would also be extreme , but not unprecedented , for a distant radio galaxy .",
    "sdss j1136 + 0242  has a fwhm larger than all but two objects in the sample of 52 studied by & mccarthy ( 2000 ) , both of which were among the 10 @xmath69 objects in the sample .",
    "a study of @xmath70 radio galaxies by ( 1997 ) found ly@xmath1  fwhms of 6701575 kms@xmath3 , with the largest fwhm in small radio sources ( @xmath7150 kpc ) .",
    "additionally , ly@xmath1  absorption was seen in 9 of 10 small radio sources , but in only 2 of 8 radio sources larger than 50 kpc .",
    "thus , the large ly@xmath1  emission fwhm and presence of ly@xmath1  absorption in sdss j1136 + 0242  is consistent with it being a compact radio galaxy .",
    "the ly@xmath1  luminosity of sdss j1136 + 0242  is not exceptional .",
    "ly@xmath1-emitting halos are often seen around powerful radio galaxies ( van ojik et  al .",
    "1997 ) and radio - loud quasars ( bremer et  al .",
    "1992 ) , and occasionally around radio - quiet quasars ( bergeron et  al . 1999 ; bunker et  al .",
    "2003 ) . the observed ly@xmath1  luminosity of sdss j1136 + 0242  is @xmath72 erg s@xmath3 , and even the inferred intrinsic ly@xmath1  luminosity ( see  [ 2q ] ) of @xmath73 erg s@xmath3 is a factor of 10 below the largest ly@xmath1  luminosities seen in radio galaxies ( villar - martn et  al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the luminosity of the two - photon continuum is nearly unprecedented , however . if only the two - photon continuum and ly@xmath1  were observed , sdss j1136 + 0242  would still have @xmath74 , a magnitude equalled by fewer than a handful of powerful radio galaxies at @xmath75 ( chambers , miley , & van breugel 1988 ; pentericci et  al .",
    "1997 ; de breuck et  al .",
    "the @xmath12 magnitude of sdss j1136 + 0242  ties with the brightest observed among powerful radio galaxies at @xmath75 in the sample of ( 2003 ) and is @xmath2125 brighter than their best - fit @xmath76 relation .",
    "two - photon continuum is not usually considered to be the dominant explanation for the uv continua of powerful radio galaxies .",
    "however , it clearly contributes a similar fraction of the continuum luminosity in some radio galaxies as it does in sdss j1136 + 0242  ( vernet et  al .",
    "2001 ) , and the fact that dust mixed with the emitting gas can modify the characteristic shape of the two - photon continuum may mean that it is more common than has been concluded from analyses that neglect that effect .",
    "the volume @xmath77 of the region emitting the ly@xmath1  line and the two - photon continuum can be estimated using the relation @xmath78 erg s@xmath3 ( villar - martn et  al .",
    "2003 ) with the constraint that @xmath79 @xmath42 .",
    "relevant estimates of the filling factor of the ly@xmath1-emitting gas , @xmath80 , range from 10@xmath81 to @xmath82 (  4.2.4 of 2003 ) , but if we apply the above equation to the intrinsic @xmath83 inferred from the sdss spectroscopy then @xmath80 must be such that the emission region in sdss j1136 + 0242  is smaller in angular size than the sdss fiber diameter of 3  ( corresponding to 11.8 kpc at @xmath0 ) . assuming a typical radio galaxy narrow - line region ( nlr ) with @xmath84 @xmath42 ( villar - martn et  al .",
    "2003 ) , a relatively high filling factor of @xmath85 is inferred .",
    "spatially resolved observations of the ly@xmath1  emission would clearly be useful to clarify its origin and to jointly constrain the density and filling factor of the ly@xmath1-emitting gas .    one important difference between sdss j1136 + 0242  and",
    "the brightest @xmath86 radio galaxies is that at least some of the latter objects have much higher polarizations ( 5 - 10% vs. @xmath711% for sdss j1136 + 0242 ; 2001 ) .",
    "this difference can be explained if sdss j1136 + 0242  is viewed close to face - on , unlike most powerful radio galaxies .",
    "such a viewing angle maximizes the symmetry of any scattering , thereby decreasing the observed polarization . for a biconical scattering region geometry with opening half - angle 45  and a maximum @xmath87% at a viewing angle from the cone axis of @xmath88 ,",
    "an observed @xmath89% is possible at @xmath90 ( manzini & di serego alighieri 1996 ) .",
    "the larger the opening angle of the bicones , the larger the range of @xmath91 for which @xmath89% , and of course @xmath92% for a spherical scattering region .      the scenario outlined above for sdss j1136 + 0242   a face - on radio galaxy with an extended , dusty , low - metallicity , ly@xmath1-emitting nlr",
    " explains many of its characteristics .",
    "we now discuss possible explanations for why we see a luminous , featureless , and variable ultraviolet continuum but no emission from the broad - line region , properties which are not immediately explained by this model .",
    "* the observed variability , among other arguments , rules out a stellar origin for the observed uv continuum ( see appendix [ lens ] ) . *",
    "if by chance a gap in the obscuring matter enables us to see the continuum source in this object , we should also see emission from the broad - line region unless the gap is very small ( since the continuum source is smaller than the blr ) or the blr produces unusually weak lines ( see appendix [ blagn ] ) . some broad absorption line ( bal ) quasars have very weak metal emission lines , but no bal outflow has ever been seen to absorb emission lines without also strongly absorbing the continuum . * a related possibility is that we _ are _ seeing the continuum source and the blr , but that the latter has a very high density of @xmath93 @xmath42 and has thermalized so that it emits only blackbody radiation .",
    "the dominant range of temperatures expected for such emission is @xmath94  k ( ferland 1999 ) , and our photometry covers the peak wavelengths of such blackbodies .",
    "there is no clear sign of such emission in the photometry or spectroscopy .",
    "it is true that blackbody emission could help explain the deficit of @xmath12-band flux found when the spectrum is modeled as a reddened power - law with @xmath25@xmath28 (  [ 2q ] ) , but the temperature of such putative emission would have to be @xmath95 .",
    "this is too narrow a temperature range , and too far below the expected temperatures , to be considered a detection of thermalized blr emission .",
    "* perhaps we have an unobscured sightline to a central engine which simply lacks a blr . for example , , martocchia , & matt ( 2003 ) have suggested that agn with accretion rates @xmath96 of the eddington rate might lack broad lines .",
    "but if sdss j1136 + 0242   was accreting at such a low rate , explaining its observed luminosity would require an implausibly large black hole mass of @xmath97 ( peterson 1997 ; mclure & dunlop 2004 ) .",
    "thus , a different explanation than that of ( 2003 ) would need to be found if sdss j1136 + 0242  is shown to lack a blr .",
    "* seyfert 2 galaxies are known to have an unpolarized , featureless uv continuum which is not attributable to starlight , but is plausibly due to optically thin free - free emission ( tran 1995 ) .",
    "however , this emission component usually arises from outside the broad - line region , where any variability timescale should be longer than the rest - frame 40 - 70 days observed in sdss j1136 + 0242 .",
    "moreover , this emission component typically accounts for only @xmath44% of the total uv flux of a seyfert 1 galaxy , whereas it would have to account for @xmath470% of the uv flux in sdss j1136 + 0242 .",
    "* the continuum could be relativistically beamed synchrotron emission from a jet pointing nearly along our line of sight .",
    "the beaming factor must be at least @xmath415 to explain the low equivalent widths of civ  and ciii ] .",
    "beaming would be consistent with the face - on orientation of sdss j1136 + 0242  invoked to explain the absence of highly polarized scattered light . while synchrotron - dominated objects ( blazars ) usually have high intrinsic polarizations , there are at least two possible explanations for why that is not the case here .",
    "one is that such polarization is highly variable : some bl  lac objects with @xmath98% at one epoch have been seen to have @xmath89% at another epoch ( jannuzi , smith , & elston 1993 ; visvanathan & wills 1998 ) .",
    "the other is that the synchrotron emission in blazars typically arises from several emission regions , and that unless those regions have aligned polarization vectors the overall polarization will be reduced (  4.1.1 of & smith 2000 ) .",
    "however , there are two strong arguments against this beaming hypothesis .",
    "first , the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of sdss j1136 + 0242  is much steeper between radio and uv frequencies than is the case for blazars ( fig .",
    "12 of 1998 ) .",
    "second , blazars are typically polarized parallel to the radio jet axis , because the synchrotron emission arises in shocks where compression yields magnetic fields oriented perpendicular to the jet flow ( recall that the polarization and magnetic field vectors are perpendicular ) .",
    "but in sdss j1136 + 0242 , if we identify the radio major axis (  [ radio ] ) as the jet axis then the polarization is consistent with being perpendicular to it ( @xmath99 ) . *",
    "sdss j1136 + 0242  may be a higher - redshift , lower - luminosity analog of the quasar pg 1407 + 265  ( mcdowell et  al . 1995 ) , which has very weak , very broad , highly blueshifted high - ionization emission lines ( civ  has rew=4.6@xmath192    and is blueshifted by 10200@xmath191200kms@xmath3  from h@xmath1 ; both lines have a fwhm of @xmath27000kms@xmath3 ) .",
    "the sed of pg 1407 + 265  is a very good match to the median radio - quiet quasar sed of ( 1994 ) , and so its weak lines can not be explained by a very soft ionizing continuum ( leighly , halpern , & jenkins 2004 ) or a relativistically beamed continuum .",
    "nonetheless , , beasley , & bicknell ( 2003 ) have presented strong evidence for the existence of a relativistic jet in pg 1407 + 265  oriented very close to our line of sight .",
    "unlike most blazars , pg 1407 + 265  has a very low polarization of @xmath100% at a position angle roughly perpendicular to the jet axis ( @xmath101 , assuming the jet axis is the a - b axis in 2003 ) .",
    "these observations place pg 1407 + 265  in the class of low - polarization radio quasars ( lister & smith 2000 ) .",
    "such objects are thought to represent quiescent blazars whose jets do not harbor strong shocks , resulting in magnetic fields which are not necessarily oriented perpendicular to the flow .",
    "+ pg 1407 + 265  and sdss j1136 + 0242  are similar in that they have weak uv emission lines , low polarizations apparently oriented perpendicular to the radio jet axis , and nearly face - on orientations .",
    "it is not known why pg 1407 + 265  has such unusual emission - line properties , but whatever the explanation is , it may apply to both objects .",
    "if sdss j1136 + 0242  is similar to pg 1407 + 265 , we expect that optical spectra with a higher snr will reveal very broad , weak , highly blueshifted emission lines and that near - ir spectra will reveal strong feii  emission ( mcdowell et  al .",
    "in addition , as a low - polarization radio quasar , sdss j1136 + 0242  should have a radio core with the same , low polarization as the optical continuum and with the same polarization position angle roughly perpendicular to the jet axis .",
    "the newly discovered , radio - loud agn sdss j1136 + 0242  is unusual in possessing a strong continuum without accompanying strong metal - line emission . of @xmath42400 quasars in the sdss data release 1 quasar catalog ( schneider et  al .",
    "2003 ) with @xmath102 , sufficient to place ly@xmath1  within the spectral coverage of the sdss spectrographs , it is the only object with strong , relatively narrow ly@xmath1  emission and no accompanying metal - line emission ( excepting broad absorption line quasars where such emission is absorbed along with part or all of the continuum ) .",
    "the spectrum of sdss j1136 + 0242  can generally be understood as that of a very optically luminous radio galaxy , in terms of ly@xmath1  emission flux , velocity width , associated narrow ly@xmath1  and civ  absorption , civ / ly@xmath1  ratio ( from a low - metallicity nlr ) , and even two - photon continuum strength (  [ 2q ] and  [ nlagn ] ) .",
    "however , sdss j1136 + 0242  has a very strong uv continuum not seen in radio galaxies (  [ cont ] ) .",
    "this continuum is unpolarized , suggesting a face - on orientation for sdss j1136 + 0242 .",
    "the continuum could be relativistically beamed synchrotron emission which swamps the intrinsic broad - line emission , but the sed of sdss j1136 + 0242  is not a good match to known synchrotron - dominated objects .",
    "a more likely possibility is that sdss j1136 + 0242  is a pg 1407 + 265  analog : a low - polarization radio quasar which for some unknown reason has very weak , very broad , highly blueshifted high - ionization emission lines .",
    "a better optical spectrum is needed to determine if such features are present in sdss j1136 + 0242 .",
    "this scenario predicts polarization perpendicular to the axis of the radio jet , which is tentatively observed to be the case in both sdss j1136 + 0242  and pg 1407 + 265   but requires confirmation with better polarization data .    in the unlikely event",
    "the ly@xmath1   is from a broad - line region of typical density , the dip in the continuum otherwise attributed to hi  two - photon emission is unexplained .",
    "also , the blr would have to consist predominantly of low - ionization or low - metallicity gas ( appendix [ blagn ] ) .",
    "if the former , it is unclear what about sdss j1136 + 0242  causes its lack of the high - ionization gas which dominates the broad - line regions of most agns . if the latter , metallicities @xmath621% of solar are required .",
    "further investigation of sdss j1136 + 0242  would benefit from better optical spectra ( preferably spatially resolved to search for and measure any spatial extent of ly@xmath1 ) , better optical polarimetry ( or at least another epoch of the same quality ) , deep , high - resolution radio imaging and polarimetry to determine the jet axis , near - ir spectroscopy to study the rest - frame optical spectrum , and multiwavelength photometry to determine if its spectral energy distribution can be reconciled with those of blazars .",

    "if the match of the spectral shape of sdss j1136 + 0242  to that of the hi  two - photon continuum is coincidental , we might be seeing emission from a blr with @xmath103 @xmath42 and unusual parameters that suppress emission from lines other than ly@xmath1 .",
    "( 1999 ) , hereafter f99 , discuss the line emission from a single quasar broad - line region gas cloud as a function of many different physical parameters .",
    "civ  emission is an important coolant in photoionized gas , and so weak civ   emission indicates gas with low metallicity ( @xmath104 ) , low ionization ( @xmath105 ) , or both .",
    "tentative emission line flux ratios and limits for sdss j1136 + 0242  are listed in table [ t_ratio ] , along with ratios from two photoionization simulations given in f99 .",

    "the low - metallicity model is reasonably consistent with the data , but would be strongly rejected if the nominal detection of aliii  in the variable-@xmath32 fit is correct .",
    "( the fixed-@xmath32 fit yields only an upper limit on aliii . )",
    "note that the presence of associated civ  absorption with saturated line ratios does _ not _ rule out the low - metallicity model . even low metallicity civ  absorption systems are often saturated at the sdss spectral resolution , and the associated absorption systems often seen in agn can be located in nearby galaxies or in host galaxy disks or halos , as well as near the nucleus ( hamann & ferland 1999 ) .    of the models plotted , the line ratios of sdss j1136 + 0242  are most consistent with emission from low - ionization , high - density clouds .",
    "the greatest discrepancy ( 2@xmath363@xmath35 ) in that scenario is that siiii ]  is predicted to be @xmath410 times stronger than observed .",
    "nonetheless , it is preferred over the normal density low - ionization simulation because the latter predicts too strong a ciii ]  line , at the 4@xmath366@xmath35 level .",
    "if we adopt the locally optimally - emitting cloud model pioneered by ( 1995 ) , in which the emitting gas is assumed to span a wide range in density and distance ( and therefore ionization parameter ) , a low metallicity scenario is preferable .",
    "otherwise , we would have to explain why gas exists close to the black hole ( to produce the uv continuum source ) and far away from it ( to produce low - ionization emission ) , but not at intermediate distances where broad metal - line emission is normally produced .",
    "we were initially enamored of the possibility that sdss j1136 + 0242  could be a lensed lyman - break galaxy ( lbg ) similar to ms1512-cb58 ( yee et  al .",
    "1996 ) , but with ly@xmath1  in emission .",
    "this was due in part to its spectrum being radically different from a typical broad - line agn and in part to the dip in the spectrum between ly@xmath1  and @xmath41280   , which is not generally seen in quasars but is seen in lbgs ( shapley et  al .",
    "however , the evidence against lensing is overwhelming .",
    "first , sdss j1136 + 0242  is photometrically variable at the 99.8% confidence level , with @xmath113 ( averaged over five bands ) over 67 rest - frame days .",
    "such variability is common in agn but would be inexplicable for a lyman - break galaxy .",
    "second , sdss j1136 + 0242  is unresolved in the sdss @xmath7 imaging and in @xmath11 imaging obtained on ut 2003 april 19 at the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) with the cfhtir camera . in the cfht image , sdss j1136 + 0242",
    "has fwhm=059 , compared to fwhm=@xmath114 measured from 6 stars in the same image .",
    "a double - image lens with separation 02 would have a fwhm=063 in 060 seeing , and so lensing with separation @xmath115 is ruled out at the @xmath116 level .",
    "this does not necessarily rule out a high magnification lens  for example , apm 08279 + 5255 has a separation of 0378 and a magnification of @xmath440@xmath3690 ( ibata et  al .",
    "1999 )  but it does considerably narrow the parameter space accessible to such a lens . similarly , a cluster - lens such as ms1512-cb58 is rendered unlikely by the non - detection of any other object within 11  in either the ctio , cfht or sdss imaging , to limits @xmath43 magnitudes fainter than sdss j1136 + 0242  in @xmath16 , @xmath42 magnitudes in @xmath11 , and @xmath41 magnitude in @xmath12 .",
    "a lensing cluster would have to have a redshift @xmath1171 to avoid detection in those data .",
    "third , the spectral properties of sdss j1136 + 0242  are very different from those of lbgs .",
    "its rest - frame uv spectral index ( @xmath118 ) is much redder than is typical for lbgs ( @xmath119@xmath25@xmath120 ; 2002 ) . and",
    "if it was a lbg , sdss j1136 + 0242  would go against the trend found by ( 2002 ) for the uv continuum to become bluer with increasing ly@xmath1  emission strength . additionally , perusal of model uv spectra for a wide range of young stellar population models ( leitherer et  al .",
