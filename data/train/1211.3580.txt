    "note , however , that small @xmath36 is disfavored by b - physics as it enhances the @xmath188 coupling too much , see for example  @xcite .    once again , we emphasize that a substantial enhancement of the @xmath1 rate _ is _",
    "possible for the @xmath2 in type i models without enhancing the @xmath0 rate .",
    "in particular , from table  [ tabhionly ] we see that the enhancement in the @xmath75 channel is @xmath13 ( for both @xmath93 fusion and vbf ) for @xmath189 and @xmath15 while other final states , in particular @xmath0 , have close to sm rates .",
    "the table also shows that this maximum is achieved for @xmath190 .",
    "thus , @xmath191 and @xmath192 yielding sm - like coupling of the @xmath2 to quarks ( see table  [ fermcoups ] ) and vector bosons .",
    "it turns out that in these cases the total enhancement , @xmath193 , is provided by the charged higgs boson loop contribution to the @xmath75-coupling . in these same cases , the mass of the heavier higgs boson is @xmath194 .",
    "as such a mass is within the reach of the lhc , it is important to make sure that the @xmath3 can not be detected ( at least with the current data set ) .",
    "it is easy to see that indeed this is the case . since @xmath195 and @xmath196 one finds that the @xmath3 decouples from both vector bosons and fermions given that @xmath197 and @xmath191 .",
    "the @xmath59 will also be difficult to detect since it has no tree - level @xmath198 coupling and the @xmath199 couplings , being proportional to @xmath60 , will be quite suppressed , especially at @xmath118 . from table",
    "[ tabhionly ] , we observe that for @xmath189 and @xmath15 the corresponding charged higgs is light , @xmath200 ,  as small as allowed by lep2 direct searches in @xmath201 . searches for a light @xmath202 are underway at the lhc along the lines described in @xcite .",

    "the existing lhc bounds on @xmath208 obtained assuming @xmath209 are only moderately restrictive : @xmath210  @xcite ( @xmath211)@xcite for masses of the charged higgs boson @xmath212 in the case of atlas ( cms ) , respectively .",
    "these bounds are weakened in the type i model where @xmath213 . since @xmath214 , large @xmath36 suppresses @xmath208 .",

    "however , one can imagine that the @xmath22-even @xmath2 or @xmath3 and the @xmath59 both have mass close to @xmath4 and that the net @xmath1 rate gets substantial contributions from both the @xmath2 or @xmath3 and the @xmath59 while only the former contributes to the @xmath0 rate .",
    "these possibilities are explored in figs .",
    "[ haonly ] and [ haonly ] , from which we observe that an enhanced @xmath1 rate is only possible for the @xmath226 choice .",
    "details for this case appear in table  [ tabahi ] .    for the type i model ,",
    "we see from table  [ tabahi ] that @xmath112 is significantly enhanced only for the same @xmath189 and @xmath118 values as in the case of having ( only ) @xmath108 and that the pseudoscalar contribution @xmath227 turns out to be tiny . however , the contribution to the @xmath228 final state from the @xmath59 _ can _ be substantial .",
    "given that the top loop dominates both the @xmath229 and @xmath131 coupling one finds @xmath230 , where we used @xmath231 from table  [ fermcoups ] and the @xmath232 fermionic loop ratio of @xmath233 .",
    "as a result , the @xmath59 can contribute even more to the @xmath228 final state rate than the @xmath2 if @xmath36 is small .",
    "this ( unwanted ) contribution to the @xmath228 final state from @xmath59 production is apparent from the results for @xmath234 in table  [ tabahi ] for @xmath235 . in the end , only @xmath236 yields both an enhanced @xmath1 rate , @xmath237 , and sm - like rates for the @xmath0 and @xmath228 final states , @xmath238 . for this case @xmath239 and @xmath240 implying that the @xmath2 couples to fermions and gauge bosons like a sm higgs boson and the enhancement of @xmath241 is due exclusively to the charged higgs loop contribution to the @xmath1 couplings .        for the type ii model , see table  [ tabahii ] , the pseudoscalar contribution @xmath227 is also ( as for the type i model ) negligible .",
    "thus , the enhancement of @xmath224 is essentially the same as that for @xmath242 for the case when only @xmath108 , reaching maximum values of order @xmath116 .",
    "however , as in the pure @xmath108 case , a substantial enhancement of @xmath224 is most often associated with @xmath243 ( contrary to the lhc observations ) .",
    "but this is not _",
    "always _ the case . among the @xmath244 scenarios we find 56 points in our parameter space for which @xmath245 and @xmath246",
    "unfortunately for all those points the @xmath247 signal is predicted to be too strong , @xmath248 , a result that is now excluded by the cms analysis in the gluon fusion dominated @xmath114-jet trigger mode which finds @xmath249 at 95% cl .",
    "this situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ corbb ] . as seen from the upper panels in fig .",
    "[ corbb ] , for @xmath250 there exist points ( blue diamonds ) such that @xmath251 and @xmath252 ( or even @xmath253 ) .",
    "however , the lower left panel of fig .  [ corbb ] shows that the @xmath225 values that correspond to those points are greater than @xmath254 .",
    "the case with @xmath255 and @xmath109 is less attractive . for the type i model ,",
    "the constraints are such that once parameters are chosen so that @xmath3 and @xmath59 have masses of @xmath4 and @xmath256 the maximum value achieved for @xmath257 is rather modest reaching only @xmath258 at small @xmath36 . for the type ii model , as seen in fig .",
    "[ haonly ] , there are no parameter choices for which the @xmath3 and @xmath59 have a mass of @xmath20 while all other constraints are satisfied .",
    "finally , we have the case where @xmath108 and @xmath259 and we allow @xmath74 and @xmath86 to vary freely . following a similar search strategy , we find that some of the @xmath36 values previously available when only @xmath108 or @xmath109 was required are ruled out by the full set of constraints and that there is no gain in maximal @xmath260 values , and often some loss , relative to the cases where only the @xmath2 or only the @xmath3 was required to have mass of @xmath4 . +   + as discusssed earlier and in @xcite , the charged higgs contribution to the @xmath1 coupling loops is sometimes relevant .",
    "therefore , in fig .  [ hcamp ]",
    "we show separately the fermionic loop , @xmath129 loop and @xmath202 loop contributions normalized to the total amplitude for the most interesting cases of a type i model with @xmath108 and with @xmath221 ( left plots ) .",
    "one sees that the @xmath36 values of 4 and 20 associated with @xmath261 are associated with large @xmath262 .",
    "indeed , in these two cases , the relative charged higgs contribution reaches nearly @xmath263 and is as large as the fermionic contribution , but of the opposite sign .",
    "in fact , although the dominant loop is the @xmath129 loop , the @xmath202 loop may contribute as much as the dominant ( top quark ) fermionic loop .",
    "this should be contrasted with other cases , such as the type ii @xmath108 and @xmath264 cases illustrated in the right - hand plots of fig .",
    "[ hcamp ] .",
    "one finds that the charged higgs contributions are small when sup constraints are imposed .",
    "in fact , the enhancement of @xmath112 observed in fig .",
    "[ honly ] prior to imposing sup is caused just by the charged higgs loop .",
    "when sup constraints are imposed the charged higgs amplitude is strongly reduced by the requirement that the quartic couplings not violate the perturbativity condition .",
    "note that the sup constraints can be violated even though all the mass parameters have been varied within what , a priori , appears to be a reasonable range , namely from a few gev up to @xmath265 .",
    "this is due to the fact that , for our input , the sup conditions imply a strong constraint on @xmath89 that comes mainly from the requirement of keeping @xmath266 small enough .     amplitude normalized to the imaginary part of the sum of all ( fermions , @xmath267 , @xmath268 ) contributions as a function of @xmath36 after imposing all constraints .",

    "we have analyzed the type i and type ii two - higgs - doublet extensions of the standard model with regard to consistency with a significant enhancement of the gluon - fusion - induced @xmath75 signal at the lhc at @xmath20 , as seen in the atlas data set , but possibly not in the cms results presented at moriond 2013 .",
    "all possible theoretical and experimental constraints have been imposed .",
    "we find that vacuum stability , unitarity and perturbativity play the key role in limiting the maximal possible enhancement which , in the most interesting scenarios , is generated by the charged higgs loop contribution to the higgs to two photon decay amplitude .",
    "generically , we conclude that the type ii model allows a maximal enhancement of order of @xmath116 , whereas within the type i model the maximal enhancement is limited to @xmath270 .",
    "moriond 2013 atlas results suggest an enhancement for @xmath271 of order @xmath272 ( but with large errors ) .",
    "only type ii models can give such a large value .",
    "however , we find that in the type ii model the parameters that give @xmath121 are characterized by @xmath273 , a result that is inconsistent with the atlas central value of @xmath274 .",
    "thus , the type ii model can not describe the atlas data if only the @xmath2 resides at @xmath4 .",
    "similar statements apply to the case of the heavier @xmath3 having a mass of @xmath4 .",
    "in contrast , the cms data suggests values of @xmath124 and @xmath125 , easily obtained in the type ii model context .",
    "next , we considered type ii models with approximately degenerate higgs bosons at @xmath4 .",
    "we found that for @xmath275 there exist theoretically consistent parameter choices for type ii models for which @xmath276 , fully consistent with the atlas results .",
    "unfortunately , in these cases @xmath277 , a value far above that observed .",
    "thus , the type ii 2hdms can not yield @xmath278 without conflicting with other observables . in short ,",
    "the type ii model is unable to give a significantly enhanced @xmath6 signal while maintaining consistency with other channels .    in the case of the type i model ,",
    "the maximal @xmath112 is of order of @xmath113 , as found if @xmath189 or @xmath15 . in these cases ,",
    "@xmath110 and @xmath111 are of order 1 . for these scenarios ,",
    "the charged higgs is light , @xmath16 .",
    "( despite this small mass , there is no conflict with lhc data due to the fact that @xmath279 is small enough to be below current limits . )",
    "thus , type i models could provide a consistent picture if the lhc results converge to only a modest enhancement for @xmath280 .",
    "overall , if @xmath112 is definitively measured to have a value much above 1.3 while the @xmath0 and/or @xmath247 channels show little enhancement then there is no consistent 2hdm description .",
