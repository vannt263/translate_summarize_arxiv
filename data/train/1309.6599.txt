    "in the recent years , the model of light vector particles with kinetic mixing to the standard model photon has received tremendous attention , theoretically as well as experimentally . whereas @xmath3 is mainly being probed in medium - to - high energy collider experiments , masses in the sub - mev regime are subject to severe astrophysical and cosmological constraints .",
    "below @xmath4 ev , those limits are complemented by direct laboratory searches for dark photons in non - accelerator type experiments . among the most prominent",
    "are the `` light - shining - through - wall '' experiments ( lsw )  @xcite and the conversion experiments from the solar dark photon flux , `` helioscopes ''  @xcite ; a collection of low - energy constraints on dark photons can _ e.g. _  be found in the recent review  @xcite .",
    "helioscopes derive their sensitivity from the fact that such light vectors are easily produced in astrophysical environments , such as in the solar interior , covering a wide range of masses up to @xmath5 few kev . in general , stellar astrophysics provides stringent constraints on any type of light , weakly - interacting particles once the state becomes kinematically accessible  @xcite . only in a handful of examples",
