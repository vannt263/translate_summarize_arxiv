    "the exact solutions of the dirac equation in a superposition of a homogeneous magnetic field @xmath0 and a classical monochromatic electromagnetic wave field propagating along  @xmath0   ( the so - called redmond configuration ) were found for the first time in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "a transformation was introduced , in analogy with the volkov solution @xcite , which reduces the solution of the dirac equation for fields of the redmond configuration to a product of the solution of a klein - gordon equation for these fields and a bispinor of a free particle .",

    "an exact solution of the dirac equation and the spectrum of particle quasi - energies for fields of the redmond configuration is found , taking into account the electron anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "we consider the case of circular wave polarization using the method suggested in @xcite .",
    "in addition , electron and positron states are distinguished by introducing the quantum number  @xmath1 which is positive and negative for electrons and positrons respectively .",
    "furthermore , it is shown that by taking into account the electron anomalous magnetic moment the degeneracy in the quantum spin states is removed . moreover , owing to the presence of the anomalous magnetic moment and at certain values of other parameters , the relative positions of the quasi ",

    "this latter is important for the consideration of spin effects .",
    "the establishment of the quasi  energy spectrum allows us to obtain the photon absorption and radiation spectrum .",
    "it is found that the radiation frequency is shifted because of the influence of the intensity of the wave field and that this shift can be considerable .",
    "these theoretical considerations are of direct relevance for various applications : laser acceleration @xcite ; electron  positron pair creation at high wave field intensities @xcite ; fast measurement of the absolute energy of charged unpolarized particles with a relative precision of @xmath2 over a wide energy range up to tev energies , and so on .",
    "it is important that during the measurement of the energy of longitudinally spin  polarized electrons by this method , the degree of polarization does not decrease .",
