    "in the mid 1980 s the jones polynomial of a link was introduced @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it was defined as the normalized trace of an element of a braid group , corresponding to the link , in a certain representation .",
    "although a topological invariant , the extrinsic nature of its computation made the relationship between topological configurations lying in the complement of the knot and the value of the jones polynomial obscure . in order to elucidate this connection , witten @xcite introduced topological quantum field theory .",
    "tqft is a cut and paste technique which allows for localized computation of the jones polynomial .",
    "following his discovery various approaches to topological quantum field theory were introduced ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and others ) . in the work of witten ,",
    "it is obvious that the vector spaces of topological quantum field theory are quantizations of the space of connections on the manifold",
    ". initial considerations of tqft focused on the formal rules of combination of vector spaces and vectors .",
    "as more intrinsic developments of tqft appeared there was a shift towards the use of the kauffman bracket skein module .",
    "the kauffman bracket skein module of a 3-manifold can be thought of as a quantization of the @xmath0characters of the manifold @xcite .",
    "this approach to tqft recovers some of the initial feel of witten s work .",
    "although the study of @xmath1-manifold invariants is substantial in itself , few applications to classical @xmath1-manifold topology have been found . in this paper",
    ", we use quantum invariants to develop obstructions to embedding one 3-manifold in another . in order to extract quantum invariants from a 3-manifold",
    "a good deal of extra information about its boundary is needed .",
    "the big challenge is to sort out what is information about the manifold and what is just data about the parameterization chosen for the boundary .",
    "a very similar problem arises in differential geometry .",
    "the riemannian curvature tensor is a classifying invariant of the metric structure of the manifold , but it comes in the form of a tensor that depends intimately on the choice of local coordinates . to sidestep this , invariant functions of the coefficients of the tensor are used in order to obtain numbers that are independent of the choice of local coordinates .",
    "similarly , we take the quantum invariant of a manifold and perform a construction to produce an invariant that is independent of the extra information about how the boundary is parametrized .    in the next section",
    "needed definitions are recalled and the tqft is constructed . the path we take is the elegant approach of roberts @xcite , along with a simplification of sikora @xcite .",
    "this is a compact and eminently computable approach to topological quantum field theory .",
    "the vector spaces are built out of framed links in the manifold , so that they have a topological feel much like singular homology and fundamental group .    in the following section we prove a theorem that gives an obstruction to embedding one 3-manifold in another and illustrate it with an application of quantum obstructions .",
    "if a 3-manifold contains a punctured lens space then it can not be embedded in the 3-sphere .",
    "this observation lies at the heart of the technique of scharlemann cycles - a technique that has been extremely fruitful in resolving questions about dehn surgery on knots .",
    "our proposition generalizes this criterion and opens the door to the use of quantum invariants in similar combinatorial arguments .",
    "there is a construction of topological quantum field theory based on the witten - reshetikhin - turaev invariants due to blanchet , habegger , masbaum and vogel @xcite .",
    "the vector space associated to a surface is a quotient of the vector space with basis given by all connected oriented 3-manifolds having that surface as boundary .",
    "there is a pairing between the vector space of a surface and the vector space associated to the same surface with the opposite orientation . specifically , if @xmath2 then @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the witten - reshetikhin - turaev invariant of level @xmath5 @xcite , normalized so that the invariant of the 3-sphere is 1 . to obtain the vector space of a surface",
    "take the quotient of the vector space above by the radical of this form .",
    "the invariant of a connected 3-manifold with boundary is just its image in the quotient .",
    "we take a different approach here , with equivalent results , that makes fundamental computations more direct .",
    "the full apparatus of topological quantum field theory is not needed , as the invariant we derive is independent of framing .",
    "hence , we set up a projective topological quantum field theory .",
