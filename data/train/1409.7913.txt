    "with the development of fabrication technologies , ultrathin ferroelectric films used as tunneling barriers have attracted significant interest in many fields@xcite .",
    "typically , ferroelectric tunnel junction(ftj ) prepared by using an epitaxial ultrathin ferroelectric layer as a tunnel barrier sandwiched between two mental electrodes has brought great progress in experiment and theory @xcite . in the past decade",
    ", it was shown that ferroelectricity could be maintained in perovskite oxides films with thickness of the order of a few nanometers@xcite , these experimental results were consistent with first - principles calculations predicting the critical thickness of ferroelectric barrier could as thin as a few lattice parameters@xcite , and the existence of ferroelectricity in ultrathin films gives possibilities for nonvolatile memories , such as ferroelectric and muliferroic tunnel junctions . compared with conventional memories , ferroelectric memories have the advantage of high read and write speed and high density data storage@xcite .",
    "the existed researches confirm that the reversal of the electric polarization in ferroelectric barrier produces a change in the electrostatic potential profile across the junction , and this leads to the resistance change which can reach a few orders of magnitude for asymmetric metal electrodes@xcite . as is well known , interfaces exist inevitably in ftjs , and the interface will give rise to great influence on the transport properties of ftjs .",
    "glinchuk and morozovska@xcite introduced an interfacial dipole between the ferroelectric thin film and its substrate , and they claimed that the interfacial dipole was originated from the mismatch between the lattice constants and thermal coefficients of the film and its substrate as well as growth imperfections .",
    "duan@xcite carried out first - principles calculations of knbo@xmath1 thin film placed between two metal electrodes , they found that bonding between the metal and ferroelectric atoms at the interface induced an interfacial dipole moment , which is electrode dependent .",
    "liu@xcite demonstrated that a bao / ruo@xmath3 interface in srruo@xmath1/batio@xmath1/srruo@xmath1 epitaxial heterostructure grown on srtio@xmath1(sto ) can lead to a nonswitchable polarization state for thin batio@xmath1(bto ) films due to a fixed interfacial dipole , our group also reported that tunneling electroresistance(ter ) can be induced by the asymmetric interfaces in a ftj with symmetric electrodes@xcite .",
    "however , previous studies are focused on the effect of interface on the polarization of ferroelectric barrier , and their efforts are mostly concentrated on zero bias conductance of ftjs , and study of the interfacial effect on the current - voltage characteristics is rare .",
    "natalya a. zimbovskaya@xcite and the group of wenwu cao@xcite had carried out investigations on the current - voltage characteristics of ftjs , but the magnitude and the direction of the barrier s polarization in their models are given artificially and externally , and the coercive field has not been given within their theoretical studies . in this paper , the typical srruo@xmath1/batio@xmath1/pt ( sro / bto / pt ) structure is selected as an example to investigate the transport property of an asymmetric ftj within the framework of landau - devonshire theory and quantum tunneling theory .",
    "srruo@xmath1(sro ) is a suitable oxide electrode for the epitaxial growth due to its similar lattice constant with the substrate and bto , and pt is a well conductive metal electrode .",
    "the interfacial polarization , inhomogeneous barrier polarization and the screen charge of the electrodes are coupled together in our model , and the coercive field for the switching of barrier polarization is obtained self - consistently .",
    "it is found that the interfacial dead layers will have great influence on the @xmath0 hysteresis loop and @xmath2 behavior of ftjs , and shifts of the @xmath0 hysteresis loop and the @xmath2 loop are observed .",
    "the effects of the magnitude of interfacial polarization on the tunneling current is also studied , we hope our investigations will bring useful guidance in the studying of the interfacial effects in nanoscale devices .",
    "the typical sro / bto / pt junction(see fig .",
    "1 ) is used to simulate the @xmath0 and @xmath2 hysteretic behavior of the ferroelectric junction .",
    "it is assumed that the polarization of the bto barrier is orthogonal to the electrode , which can be realized through the misfit compression stress from the substrate . in fig .",
    "1 , p@xmath4 and p@xmath5 are the polarization of the left and right interface , respectively , and p@xmath4(p@xmath5 ) is assumed to be fixed@xcite . from the first - principles calculations , it is found that the effects of the interfacial dead layer extend for only 1 - 2 atomic layers@xcite .",
    "therefore , the thickness of the interface layer is chosen as one unit cell in this paper , i.e. , d@xmath4=d@xmath5=4 . based on the lattice model for a strained nanoscale ferroelectric capacitor@xcite",

    "as is well known , due to piezoelectric effect , the effective barrier thickness , effect electron mass , and barrier conduction band edge in a ftj will be changed under an applied electric field .",
    "cao group@xcite verified that the depolarization effect is much greater than the piezoelectric effect . therefore , to avoid extra complications in further computations , the piezoelectric effect is neglected in our following calculations . within the framework of landau theory ,",
    "the microscopic profile of polarization in each ferroelectric layer with consideration of the interfacial dead layer can be calculated numerically , therefore , the electrostatic profile @xmath54(x ) is given as @xmath55 the overall potential profile @xmath56 across the junction is the superposition of the electrostatic energy potential -e@xmath54(x ) , the electronic potential in the electrodes , the rectangular potential @xmath57(@xmath58 ) in the left(right ) interface , and @xmath59 in fe barrier .",
    "based on the potential energy distribution , the tunneling current through the junction can be calculated , the current per unit area @xmath60 can be derived form the following formula@xcite    @xmath61\\int{\\frac{d^2k_{\\parallel}}{(2\\pi)^{2}}t(e_{f},k_{\\parallel})},\\ ] ]    where @xmath62 is the transmission coefficient at the fermi energy for a given transverse wave vector @xmath63 , the transmission coefficient is obtained by solving numerically the schr@xmath64dinger equation for an electron moving in the total potential @xmath56 by imposing a boundary condition of the incident plane wave and by calculating the amplitude of the transmitted plane wave within the formation of transfer matrix , and @xmath65 are fermi - dirac distribution functions with chemical potentials @xmath66 , when a nonzero bias voltage _ v _ is applied across the junction , @xmath67 and @xmath68 satisfy @xmath69 , and the fermi - dirac distribution functions are expressed as @xmath70 and @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "we also assume the electron has a free electron mass , the fermi energy is chosen as @xmath73 , and @xmath74 and @xmath75 in the interfaces and the barrier@xcite .",
    "@xmath76-@xmath77 hysteresis loops of the sro / bto / pt junction are plotted in fig .  2 and fig .",

    "each @xmath50 can be numerically obtained from eq .",
    "( 5 ) . then , the averaged barrier polarization @xmath76 as a function of @xmath83 is plotted , and the value of coercive field can be found from the p - e loop .",
    "the profile of the total potential energy is achieved when each @xmath50 is given , and the tunneling coefficient and consequently the tunneling current can be obtained from eq .",
    "therefore , the coercive field in the @xmath2 curve in our system is consistent with the ferroelectric switching . from fig .  2 , one can see that a symmetrical @xmath0 loop occurs without consideration of the interfacial layer .",
    "the consideration of the interfacial layer will cause a shift of the @xmath0 loop , and the shift takes place along the direction of positive external field .",
    "the shift of @xmath0 loop is caused by an intrinsic bias field , which is induced by asymmetric interfacial dipoles , and the direction of the intrinsic bias field is opposite to the external field , therefore , @xmath0 loop will move to the positive direction of the applied field .",
    "the offset of @xmath0 loop on the thickness of the barrier is shown in fig .",
    "one can see , from fig .  3 , that the offset increases with the decrease of the barrier thickness under identical interfacial dipoles .",
    "as the shift of @xmath0 loop originates from the asymmetric interfacial dipoles , the effect of the interface layer on the hysteresis behavior will become more remarkable for a thinner barrier , so does the offset of @xmath0 loop for the ferroelectric junction with a thinner barrier .",

    "3 ) , the current shows jumps at @xmath87 and @xmath88 , which correspond to the switching of the average spontaneous polarization of bto .",
    "the asymmetry between the positive coercive field and the negative coercive field in @xmath2 curve is also induced by the asymmetric interfacial dipoles , and is similar to the phenomenon mentioned above in the @xmath0 hysteresis behavior .        the current density as a function of the magnitude of the interfacial polarization is given in fig .  5 for a fixed bias voltage 1.0 @xmath89 .",

    "compared fig .",
    "5(a ) with 5(b ) , it is found that @xmath60 increases with the increase of the magnitude of the left interfacial polarization @xmath81 , while @xmath60 decreases with the increase of @xmath82 .",
    "the reason is that the direction of @xmath81 is pointing to the barrier , and the increase of @xmath81 will result in the decrease of the average height of the barrier(see inset in fig .",
    "5a ) , while the increase of @xmath82 will give rise an increase of the averaged barrier potential because @xmath82 is pointing away from the barrier(see inset in fig .",
    "this behavior is analogous to the ter effect in ferroelectric junctions , which has been studied extensively in our previous work@xcite .",
    "one can also see , from fig .  5 , that the current density @xmath60 changes more quickly for the junction with a thinner barrier .",
