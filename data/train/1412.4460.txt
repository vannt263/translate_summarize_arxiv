    "during the last three decades , much of the theory of knots has been applied in quantum physics .",
    "one of remarkable discovery in the theory of knots is the jones polynomial , and it turned out that the explanation of the jones polynomial has to do with quantum theory @xcite .",
    "lomonaco and kauffman introduced quantum knots to explain how to make quantum information versions of mathematical structures in the series of papers @xcite .",
    "they build a knot mosaic system to set the foundation for a quantum knot system , which can be viewed as a blueprint for the construction of an actual physical quantum system .",
    "their definition of quantum knots was based on the planar projections of knots and the reidemeister moves .",
    "they model the topological information in a knot by a state vector in a hilbert space that is directly constructed from knot mosaics .",
    "this paper is a sequel to the research program on finding the total number of knot mosaics announced in @xcite .",
    "this counting is very important because the total number of knot mosaics is indeed the dimension of the hilbert space of these quantum knot mosaics . in @xcite ,",
    "a partition matrix argument was developed by the authors to count small knot mosaics . in this sequel",
    ", we generalize this argument to give an algorithm for counting all knot mosaics that uses recurrence relations of matrices that are called state matrices .",
    "this algorithm using state matrices turns out to be remarkably efficient to count knot mosaics .    throughout this paper ,",
    "the term  knot \" means either a knot or a link .",
    "we begin by explaining the basic notion of knot mosaics .",
    "let @xmath20 denote the set of the following eleven symbols that are called _ mosaic tiles _ ; +     @xmath21 [ fi1 ]    for positive integers @xmath22 and @xmath23 , an _",
    "@xmath0-mosaic _ is an @xmath1 matrix @xmath24 of mosaic tiles .",
    "we denote the set of all @xmath0-mosaics by @xmath25 .",
    "note that @xmath25 has @xmath26 elements .",
    "this definition is an extended version of the definition of an _",
    "@xmath23-mosaic _ as an @xmath27 matrix of mosaic tiles in @xcite .",
    "a _ connection point _ of a mosaic tile is defined as the midpoint of a mosaic tile edge that is also the endpoint of a curve drawn on the tile .",
    "then each tile has zero , two or four connection points as follows ;     [ fi2 ]    we say that two tiles in a mosaic are _ contiguous _ if they lie immediately next to each other in either the same row or the same column .",
    "a mosaic is said to be _ suitably connected _ if any pair of contiguous mosaic tiles have or do not have connection points simultaneously on their common edge .",
    "knot @xmath0-mosaic _ is a suitably connected @xmath0-mosaic whose boundary edges do not have connection points .",
    "then this knot @xmath0-mosaic represents a specific knot .",
    "@xmath28 denotes the subset of @xmath25 of all knot @xmath0-mosaics . a knot @xmath29-mosaic is simply specified by a _ knot @xmath23-mosaic_. the examples of mosaics in figure [ fig1 ]",
    "are a non - knot @xmath30-mosaic and the trefoil knot 4-mosaic .",
    "also the reader finds a complete list of all 22 knot 3-mosaics in appendix a in @xcite .        as an analog to the planar isotopy moves and",
    "the reidemeister moves for standard knot diagrams , lomonaco and kauffman @xcite created the @xmath31 mosaic planar isotopy moves and the mosaic reidemeister moves on knot mosaics .",
    "they conjectured that for any two tame knots @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and their arbitrary chosen mosaic representatives @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are of the same knot type if and only if @xmath34 and @xmath35 are of the same knot mosaic type , which is defined in @xcite .",
    "this means that knot mosaic type is a complete invariant of tame knots .",
    "kuriya and shehab @xcite verified lomonaco  kauffman conjecture .",
    "lomonaco and kauffman also proposed several questions related to knot mosaics .",
    "@xmath4 denotes the total number of elements of @xmath28 . in the series of recent papers @xcite",
    ", the authors found some results about @xmath4 .",
    "they showed that @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 for a positive integer @xmath23 , and found a table of the precise values of @xmath4 for @xmath39 ( note that @xmath40 ) ;    [ cols=\"^,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     for example , let us try to find @xmath41-entry of @xmath42 .",
    "this entry can be written as @xmath43-entry , and so counts the total number of all suitably connected @xmath44-mosaics with xoxo @xmath45-state and ooxo @xmath46-state , and additionally whose bottom mosaic tiles are @xmath47-cp as shown in figure [ fig6 ] . in this case",
    ", @xmath48 is @xmath49-cp , so has 4 choices of mosaic tiles .",
    "thus @xmath50 is @xmath51-cp , so it must be unique choice @xmath52 . similarly @xmath53 and @xmath54 have 4 choices and unique choice , respectively . thus the entry is @xmath55 .",
    "-entry of @xmath42 ]",
    "in this section , we find the state matrix @xmath57 for @xmath58 and prove theorem [ thm : main ] .",
    "we use the induction on @xmath61 . assume that @xmath62 .",
    "let @xmath63 be a suitably connected @xmath64-mosaic in @xmath65 . also let @xmath66 and @xmath67 be the suitably connected @xmath68-mosaic obtained by ignoring the rightmost column of @xmath63 and the suitably connected @xmath69-mosaic which is just the rightmost column of @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "then @xmath46-state of @xmath66 is the same as @xmath45-state of @xmath67 as shown in figure [ fig7 ] .",
    "remark that @xmath70 is the state matrix for @xmath65 where each entry @xmath71 counts the number of all suitably connected @xmath64-mosaics that have the @xmath72-th @xmath45-state and the @xmath73-th @xmath46-state in the set of @xmath74 states . also consider the state matrices @xmath75 and @xmath76 defined similarly . among these suitably connected @xmath64-mosaics counted in each entry @xmath71 ,",
    "the number of all mosaics whose @xmath46-state of the @xmath77-th column ( or equally @xmath45-state of the @xmath78-th column ) is the @xmath79-th state in the set of @xmath74 states is the product of @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "since all @xmath74 states can be appeared as states of connection points where @xmath66 and @xmath67 meet , we get @xmath82 this implies that @xmath83          first assume that @xmath22 and @xmath23 are any integers at least 3 .",
    "consider the set @xmath84 of all suitably connected @xmath85-mosaics and the associated state matrix @xmath86 . by the definition of the state matrix ,",
    "all rows represent all @xmath87 @xmath45-states and all columns represent all @xmath87 @xmath46-states of mosaics of @xmath84 . and",
    "each entry of the matrix counts the number of all suitably connected @xmath85-mosaics having specific @xmath45-state and @xmath46-state .",
    "thus the total number of elements of @xmath84 is the sum of all entries of the state matrix , which is @xmath88 .",
    "each suitably connected mosaic in @xmath84 can be extended to exactly two knot @xmath0-mosaics by twofold rule .",
    "thus the total number of all knot @xmath0-mosaics @xmath4 is twice of @xmath88 .",
    "this fact combined with proposition [ prop : np1 ] and [ prop : npq ] completes the proof except for the case that @xmath22 or @xmath23 is 2 .    for the case of @xmath89 , we denote two @xmath13 matrices @xmath14 and @xmath15 . then the same matrices @xmath90 and @xmath91 are obtained from the recurrence relations in proposition [ prop : np1 ] , and also @xmath92 which is already known .",
