    "periodically shaking potentials used to trap ultra - cold atoms is currently established as an experimental method  @xcite : tunneling has been suppressed by choosing the correct amplitude of driving both for a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in an optical lattice  @xcite and for a single atom in a double well potential  @xcite . by fine - tuning the driving frequency , tunneling in tilted systems",
    "can also be enhanced in an analogue of photon - assisted tunneling .",
    "after the driving frequency has helped to bridge potential differences , tunneling can again be controlled by tuning the driving amplitude  @xcite .",
    "bose - einstein condensates in periodically driven systems have been investigated regarding tunneling  @xcite , dynamic localization  @xcite and stabilities of exact floquet states  @xcite .",

    "@xcite such states are relevant to improve interferometric measurements  @xcite .    a promising approach to obtain mesoscopic superpositions are the collapse and revival phenomena in phase - space if the tunneling between both wells of a double - well potential is suppressed ( or alternatively , for a single - species condensate in a harmonic trapping potential the transition between two hyperfine - states ) .",
    "a noon - state then appears on the time scale  @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the interaction energy of a pair of atoms .",
    "chaos - induced entanglement generation in a periodically shaken double well should , in principle , offer the possibility to obtain mesoscopic superpositions on short time scales  @xcite . while the state will not be a perfect superposition ,",
    "the time scale on which it is reached will be an order of magnitude smaller . in this paper ,",
    "the question is if these superpositions can be achieved both for experimentally realistic conditions and for parameters such that the superposition is reproducible : in an experiment the particle number will vary from shot to shot and the tilt in a double well or the amplitude of shaking is likely to be slightly different .",

    "[ sec : robu ] demonstrates that the generation of mesoscopic quantum superpositions is robust against slight changes of the initial conditions .",
    "bose - einstein condensates in double - well potentials are interesting both experimentally and theoretically  @xcite . in order to describe a bec in a double well",
    ", we use a model originally developed in nuclear physics  @xcite : a many - particle hamiltonian in two - mode approximation  @xcite , @xmath6 where the operator @xmath7 annihilates ( creates ) a boson in well  @xmath8 ; @xmath9 is the tunneling splitting , @xmath10 is the tilt between well  1 and well  2 and @xmath11 is the driving amplitude .",
    "the interaction energy of a pair of particles in the same well is denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "the gross - pitaevskii dynamics can be mapped to that of a nonrigid pendulum  @xcite . including the term describing the periodic shaking , the classical hamiltonian is given by : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the population imbalance with @xmath14 referring to the situation with all particles in well  1 ( well  2 ) .    on the @xmath15-particle quantum level ,",
    "if all atoms occupy the single - particle state characterized by @xmath16 and @xmath17 , this leads to the wave - function @xmath18 these bimodal phase - states  @xcite are sometimes referred to as atomic coherent states .",
    "note that for finite @xmath15 these are not orthogonal : @xmath19 [ sec : char]signatures of mesoscopic quantum superpositions ---------------------------------------------------------    the signatures of entangled states described in this section can only serve as signatures of entangled states  @xcite if they are followed by a revival .",
    "however , as these revivals are only partial , this will not be a proof of entanglement but nevertheless a strong indication .",
    "furthermore , on the level of computer simulations , one does not have the necessity to distinguish between quantum superpositions and statistical mixtures .",
    "deepening information concerning the states of interest , superpositions of atomic coherent states  , can be found in @xcite .",
    "one signature of entanglement is the quantum fisher information  @xcite , here for the relative phase between the condensates in the two potential wells ( in the following abbreviatory referred to as the quantum fisher information ) . defining for pure states @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the experimentally measurable  @xcite variance of the particle number difference between both wells",
    ", one has an entanglement flag . for pure states , @xmath22 is a sufficient condition for particle - entanglement and identifies those entangled states that are useful to overcome classical phase sensitivity in interferometric measurements  @xcite . defining entangled states as states which can not be written as product states  @xcite , this statement is supported by the fact that for a single atomic coherent state  ( [ eq : acs ] ) one has @xmath23 .",
    "this is expected since in this case all atoms occupy the same single - particle state . for mixtures ,",
    "the quantum fisher information becomes more complicated ( ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) and might not be easy to measure . taking the definition  ( [ eq : qfi ] ) for an experiment leaves the difficulty to distinguish superpositions from mixtures .",
    "another experimental signature  @xcite will be provided by interference patterns after switching off the potential and letting the wave - function expand for some time .",

    "given the fact that even a single atomic coherent state can produce an impressive interference pattern , interference can not be used in a straightforward manner as an entanglement flag as in refs .",
    "let us thus consider the _ disappearance _ of interference patterns , @xmath31 this might simply mean @xmath32 ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : i ] ) ) or even heating .",
    "however , when combined with a high quantum fisher information , it will be the signature for the superposition of two ( or more ) distinct atomic coherent states with @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "this is a strong indication for mesoscopic superpositions similar to the case of the superfluid to mott - insulator transition @xcite where the dis- and reappearance of the contrast clearly indicates ( but does not proof ) the mott - insulator transition .    in order to numerically calculate the contrast",

    "plot ( b ) shows the time averaged qfi for a system with @xmath44 particles and averaging time @xmath45 .",
    "the qfi is enhanced close to the hyperbolic fixed point in the poincar section of surface ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) , which acts as a generator of mesoscopic entanglement ( c ) . ]",
    "the claim of ref .",
    "@xcite is not that mean - field chaos is the origin of entanglement generation but rather that it speeds up the emergence of mesoscopic superpositions .",
    "thus , rather than looking for entanglement generators which are only present in mean - field chaos , at least some of the aspects should be understandable in a parameter regime for which the mean - field dynamics is regular and thus the corresponding poincar surface of section ( cf .",
    "[ fig : niklas]a ) is easy to understand : essentially , there is one elliptic fixed point at @xmath48 , @xmath49 and one hyperbolic fixed point near @xmath46 and @xmath47 , in addition there are further fixed points near the top and bottom of the plot which can be discarded at this point . within the mean - field dynamics ,",
    "a solution which starts right on a hyperbolic fixed point ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) will not move at all .",
    "this , however , is different on the @xmath15-particle quantum level : preparing the system in the atomic coherent state corresponding to all @xmath15 particles being in the atomic coherent state @xmath52 will - for any @xmath53 - have contributions from neighboring atomic coherent states , cf .",
    ". those states , even on the mean - field level , do move .",
    "figure  [ fig : niklas]b shows the time - averaged quantum fisher information of all particles initially occupying an atomic coherent state . for starting values in the vicinity of the hyperbolic fixed point mentioned above , mesoscopic superpositions occur .",
    "if this is indeed what is happening , the remaining question is why the other hyperbolic fixed points do not display such a behavior : contrary to the first one , they do not lie near the separatrix for which the dynamics happens on much shorter time scales .    related to the observed acceleration of entanglement generation is the identification of enhanced atomic tunneling between the two wells in high - chaoticity regions @xcite .",
    "in this section parameters are presented where an entangled state occurs on short time scales , indicated by both signatures quantum fisher information and contrast .",
    "the robustness of this state under realistic experimental conditions is discussed . in the following the initial state",
    "is prepared without driving , hence corresponds to the thermal occupation of the eigenstates with energies @xmath54 of hamiltonian exclusive of the last term . in a typical experimental situation",
    "only some energy eigenstates are significantly occupied  @xcite which could considerably be reduced by working at lower temperatures in the sub nano kelvin range  @xcite .",
    "the initial state can be prepared in a well - controlled manner and the experimental parameters are well controllable  @xcite except for small experimental uncertainties .",
    "the occurring fluctuations of the initial particle number are discussed in this section while particle losses are not analyzed ; their effect on phase revivals has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : maps_fent_c ] shows the time development of quantum fisher information and contrast for initially ground and first excited state in dependence of the scaled driving amplitude @xmath55 .",
    "obviously both initial states show a similar behavior .",

    "but in the laboratory parameters like driving frequency @xmath58 and tilt @xmath10 will change slightly from shot to shot .",
    "figure  [ fig : mapmu0omega ] shows the influence of slight deviations on the two entanglement indicators .",
    "another parameter where deviations will occur is the initial particle number @xmath15 .",
    "the dependence of the signatures is represented in figs .",
    "[ fig : varn ] . for",

    "then , a mean phase distribution and its standard deviation can be calculated for each point of time which has been optimized in order to find a phase distribution that indicates strong entanglement and as well has a small standard deviation .",
    "in such an optimization procedure an entangled state has been found at @xmath64 where the phase distribution shows two distinct maxima , separated by @xmath65 , cf .",
