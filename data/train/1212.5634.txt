    "<S> these results have implications for the efficiency of dmrg . </S>",
    "<S> the logarithmic contribution is due to the replication of the es in every @xmath52 sector , which would be suppressed if @xmath52 was not a conserved quantity , as happens in dmrg calculations where the @xmath0 symmetry is enforced to be broken . </S>",

    "<S> the es is organized in a perturbative hierarchy and there are sub - structures reflecting the extended nature of the boundary . in the superfluid regime , </S>",
    "<S> the es reflects the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the underlying state , and is related to the tower of states known from finite - size studies of physical spectra . </S>",
    "<S> we believe the major features addressed in the two phases are generic for a wide range of gapped and gapless 2d systems .    </S>",
    "<S> our results open up a number of research directions . </S>",
    "<S> first , identifying the tos in the ground state es implies that one can use ground state analysis to explore exotic symmetry breaking scenarios ( e.g.  @xcite ) , avoiding the expensive requirement of calculating many eigenstates . </S>",
    "<S> second , our analysis points to an advantage of dmrg calculations with enforced symmetry breaking , as explained above . </S>",
    "<S> exploration of such techniques is yet to be attempted in detail . </S>",
    "<S> third , it would be interesting to explicitly see the tos structure appear for gapless phases where the symmetry breaking is more complex than the @xmath0 symmetry broken in our case . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the robust emergence of an area law in perturbation theory ( cancellation of @xmath113 terms with @xmath114 ) deserves to be better understood in a more general setting .    </S>",
