    ". see figure [ fig : fixedlattice](a ) for an example .",
    "a _ cone framework _ is also made of fixed - length bars connected by universal joints , but it is finite and symmetric with respect to a finite order rotation ; the allowed continuous motions preserve the bars lengths and connectivity and symmetry with respect to a fixed rotation center .",
    "cone frameworks get their name from the fact that the quotient of the plane by a finite order rotation is a flat cone with opening angle @xmath4 and the quotient framework , embedded in the cone with geodesic `` bars '' , captures all the geometric information @xcite .",

    "a fixed - lattice framework is _ rigid _ if the only allowed motions are translations and _ flexible _ otherwise .",
    "a cone - framework is _ rigid _ if the only allowed motions are rotations around the center and _ flexible _ otherwise .",
    "the alternate formulation for cone frameworks says that rigidity means the only allowed motions are isometries of the cone , which is just rotation around the cone point .",
