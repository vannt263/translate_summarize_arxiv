    "the lightness of the neutrinos , the lightness of the higgs boson and the evidence for a dark matter ( dm ) have been the landmarks for extensions of the particle content of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "neutrino masses are the first tangible deviation from the sm so that the best motivated new particles appear in attempts to explain small neutrino masses .",
    "the most popular explanation is the so - called seesaw mechanism in which extremely small masses of neutrinos arise on account of inverse proportionality to large masses of new , yet to be discovered particles .    in the simplest , type i seesaw model  @xcite , new heavy particles are singlets under the standard model ( sm ) gauge group .",
    "devoid of sm charges they do not feel sm forces and resemble the elusive substance contemplated by rudjer bokovi long ago . in view of the 250th anniversary of the venice - edition of his _ theoria _",
    "@xcite , it seems timely to recall the prophetic thoughts in point no .",
    "518 therein : + _ `` it could be possible to imagine that there is no force between some of existing species . in this case , the substance of one kind might freely pass through that of another , without any collision .",
    "in the same way , two of the species might have a common force law with third species , without any force between the first two '' .",
    "_    the type i seesaw mediators , as a substance without sm charges , would `` pass through our matter without any collision '' .",
    "in order to discover them , it would be mandatory to assign to them a new charge ( new gauge force ) such as right - handed weak interaction .",
    "less elusive seesaw mediators seem to be those with nontrivial electroweak charges , as introduced in the remaining two  @xcite tree - level canonical seesaw mechanisms dubbed the type ii  @xcite and type iii  @xcite .",
    "their scalar and fermion triplets allow for usual gauge invariant interactions with a neighbour sm - doublet state .",
    "this leads again to the weinberg s",
    "@xcite effective dimension - five operator @xmath0 , and relegates the masses of exotic seesaw mediators to remote @xmath1 gev of the gut scale  @xcite .",
    "it is conceivable that nature simply does not provide particles which are needed for type i , ii and iii mechanisms and that the first exotic particles we might encounter belong to the multiplets higher than the proposed triplets .",
    "such higher multiplets would be related to dimension @xmath2 operators @xmath3 studied in @xcite .",
    "the corresponding light neutrino mass is given by the seesaw formula @xmath4 , where @xmath5= 246 gev is the vev of the sm higgs .",
    "accordingly , dimension - nine operators naturally correspond to tev - scale new particles , within the discovery reach of the lhc .",
    "in order to add something new to canonical tree - level seesaw mechanisms one can employ vectorlike fermionic multiplets with non - zero hypercharge . to generate a tree - level seesaw diagram ,",
    "the hypercharge non - zero dirac leptons have to be in conjunction with additional scalar fields .",
    "let us first systematize possible realizations of such tree - level mechanism  @xcite and then focus to dimension - nine model realized with dirac lepton quintuplet @xmath6 .",
    "since the sought - after higher - dimension operator can be relevant only in the absence of possible dimension - five operator , we forbid the existence of the states which may generate conventional seesaw mechanisms : a scalar triplet @xmath7 generating type ii seesaw , and a fermion singlet @xmath8 or triplet @xmath9 generating type i and iii seesaw , respectively .",
    "then , we are restricted to two options for seesaw mediators underlined in table  [ table_conjunct ] : the triplet fermions introduced in  @xcite and the quintuplet fermions proposed in  @xcite , in our focus here .",
    "+    .the assignments of electroweak charges for exotic particles in case of dirac seesaw mediators leading to the tree - level operators up to dimension nine . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the distinctive signatures could come from doubly - charged components of the fermionic quintuplets .",
    "the signals which are good for the discovery correspond to relatively high signal rate and small sm background .",
    "two promising classes of events contain @xmath10 decaying to @xmath11 or @xmath12 lepton and @xmath13 resonance helping in @xmath10 identification : @xmath14 the lnv event having 0.7 fb with the same - sign dilepton state , which is nonexistent in the sm and thus devoid of the sm background ; @xmath15 having relatively high signal rate of 1.1 fb with respect to the sm background of 0.8 fb .",
    "the recent discovery of a higgs - like boson at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) may mark an onset of a new set of particles with mass at the 100 gev scale .",
    "simultaneously , a `` virtual physics '' in the lhc era may have important effects in rare , loop - induced processes .",
    "+ we have considered  @xcite the possible enhancement of the @xmath16 decay rate through extra contributions with charged components of scalar quadruplet @xmath17 running in the loops , additional to dominant sm contributions from the @xmath18 boson and top quark loops .",
    "the analytic expression for the diphoton @xmath16 partial width reads  @xcite @xmath19 where the three contributions corresponding to @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) refer to spin-1 ( @xmath18 boson ) , spin-1/2 ( top quark ) and charged spin-0 particles in the loop . following  @xcite we define the enhancement factor with respect to the sm decay width @xmath22 this enhancement",
    "is dominated by the lightest charged scalar @xmath23 and the value @xmath24 can be achieved up to @xmath25 gev , and the value @xmath26 up to @xmath27 gev .",
    "another loop mediated higgs decay sensitive to new charged particles is @xmath28 , where we obtain a moderate suppression of the @xmath28 decay rate in the region of the parameter space where the @xmath16 decay rate is enhanced .",
    "the need for neutrino masses modifies the `` old '' sm to a `` new @xmath29sm '' where , in order to understand the lightness of active neutrinos , one commonly introduces new heavy degrees of freedom .",
    "while no evidence for such new particles has been found so far at the lhc , evidences from astrophysics and cosmology point at 23@xmath30 of the energy density of the universe provided by dm  @xcite .",
    "notably , appealing dm candidates are heavy neutrino - like weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) .",
    "bearing in mind an accidental stability of our ordinary matter , it is tempting to imagine a setup in which dm is also accidentally stable .",
    "the so - called minimal dark matter model ( mdm )  @xcite is probably the simplest such scenario . in this setup",
    "the stability can be guaranteed for a neutral component of a large enough fermion or scalar @xmath31 multiplet , which can not form @xmath31 invariant renormalizable ( or lowest nonrenormalizable , dimension - five ) interaction - terms with the sm multiplets . for a fermion candidate",
    "it would be the quadruplet ( quintuplet ) and higher , and for a scalar candidate the sextuplet and higher . since the neutral ( dm ) component can not have the tree level interactions to the z boson , both the hypercharge @xmath32 and the third isospin - component @xmath33 must vanish .",
    "this is possible only for odd multiplets : fermion quintuplet or higher , and scalar septuplet or higher .    when employing the fermion quintuplets as seesaw mediators , like in two models presented here , they are in conjunction with appropriate scalar quadruplets .",
    "this destroys the stability which the mdm majorana quintuplet may possess in isolation .    by exploring the conditions under which the quintuplets @xmath34 could simultaneously generate neutrino masses and provide a stable dm candidate , the paper  @xcite raised the hope that the majorana quintuplet in conjunction with a scalar septuplet can do the job , leading to radiative neutrino mass mechanism ( r@xmath29mdm ) with an automatic @xmath35 symmetry .",
    "however , we have demonstrated  @xcite that this is still not possible without imposing the discrete @xmath35 symmetry by hand .",
    "this brings us back to the model  @xcite with a majorana quintuplet and a scalar quadruplet as a more minimal option .",
    "the mass of @xmath36 , as the dm particle protected by the @xmath35 symmetry , is fixed by the relic abundance to the value  @xcite @xmath37 .",
    "the choice @xmath38 gives enough suppression to lead to small neutrino masses with large yukawas , @xmath39 . in this part of the parameter space",
    "the model could have interesting lfv effects like in  @xcite .",
    "finally , we should keep in mind the possibility that dm may belong to a setup not very different from fine - tuned ( anomaly - free ) set of ordinary sm particles . a mere mismatch in the charges of the sm and dm particles",
    "explains a separate stability of two parallel worlds , and the adventure of explaining neutrino masses may for the first time reveal the charges of some of the dm species .",
