    "extended emission line regions ( eelrs ) are often observed around powerful distant radio sources @xcite , and their observed properties ( size , luminosity , kinematics and ionization state ) depend strongly on those of the radio source ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while the behaviour of the emitting material and balance between different ionization mechanisms is becoming increasingly well understood , there are still many outstanding questions .",
    "contrary to expectation , the emitting material is not always limited to lying along the radio source axis or within agn ionization cones .",
    "recent narrow band imaging observations @xcite have identified extensive emission line regions lying almost perpendicular to the radio axis , which may perhaps be related to the large gaseous halos observed at higher redshifts .",
    "the origin of the extended emission line gas  whether it exists _ in situ _ prior to the onset of the radio source , is formed from material driven out of the host galaxy by agn / radio source / starburst related outflows , or is produced via galaxy interactions / mergers associated with the radio source triggering event  is an interesting problem , and one which may be linked with both the origin of radio source activity and the host galaxy evolution .",
    "integral field spectroscopy ( ifs ) has the potential to greatly improve our understanding of eelrs , particularly in terms of building up a coherent picture of the distribution , nature and origin of the emission line gas , and the links with the radio source triggering mechanism .",
    "we have carried out ifs observations of pks1932 - 46 and pks2250 - 41 , using vimos @xcite on the vlt ut3 during 2004/2005 .",
    "the observations were reduced using vipgi @xcite ; full details are available in @xcite .",
    "additionally , long - slit spectroscopic observations of pks2250 - 41 at a pa of @xmath0 were obtained using fors1 at the vlt ut2 , and reduced using standard iraf routines .",
    "we also include the results of spitzer mips photometry of pks1932 - 46 @xcite .",
    "pks1932 - 46 is an frii radio galaxy at @xmath1 . fig .",
    "[ fig : 1932 ] displays the extracted [ oiii]5007 emission line flux from our ifs data , together with an [ oii]3727+continuum image of the field .",
    "we observe previously undetected line emitting material with a very knotty morphology .",
    "the knots seem to lie preferentially around the cocoon edges rather than directly on the jet axis .",
    "interestingly , several knots lie at large ( projected ) distances from the radio source axis ( up to @xmath2kpc ) , well outside the agn ionization cone . while the emission to the west is consistent with agn photoionization , these knots extending n / s from the host galaxy display a lower ionization state , placing them closer to the maximum starburst track of @xcite .",
    "we concur with the interpretation of @xcite , i.e. that the eelr contains a series of compact , star - forming objects , plausibly associated with the tidal debris of a merging system .",
    "star formation is not limited to the eelr knots , but is also clearly ongoing in the spiral companion galaxy to the north ( @xmath3 ) , as can be seen from the relative luminosity of the sources in our mips data .",
    "in fact , pks1932 - 464 is _ underluminous _ in the mid - ir cf .",
    "@xmath4}$ ] compared to other , similar radio sources @xcite , suggesting that on - going star formation is restricted to the eelr and the galaxy itself contains relatively little starburst - heated dust .",
    "together , our ifs and spitzer data imply that pks1932 - 46 lies in a fairly disturbed environment , and that it may be subject to the effects of both recent and incipient mergers / interactions .    pks2250 - 41 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : 2250 ] ) is an frii radio galaxy at @xmath5 , and , like pks1932 - 46 , it also displays an eelr comparable in size to the radio source .",
    "this eelr has been well - studied in the past @xcite , and the main emission line features are knotty emission regions extending to the east , and a luminous arc structure to the west , coincident with the western radio lobe .",
    "a detailed discussion of our ifs data in the context of eelr ionization state , jet - cloud interactions and the kinematics of the emission line arc can be found in @xcite ; here , we present a few key results .",
    "the most extreme gas kinematics are associated with the western radio jet and hotspot .",
    "away from the radio source axis , the more distant emission displays unresolved line widths .",
    "we also see a clear rotation profile across the eelr , confirmed in our fors1 spectrum of pks2250 - 41 .",
    "the observed velocity curve is very smooth , suggestive of a 20kpc rotating structure , and seems unaffected by the more extreme kinematics in the central regions of the galaxy .",
    "the galaxy to the ne is also included in our fors1 spectrum , and we detect low s / n balmer absorption features at a similar redshift to pks2250 - 41 .",
    "the faint , diffuse band of emission extending north - eastwards between the host galaxy and the companion galaxy ( resolved out in the higher resolution emission line images of @xcite but visible in the @xcite data ) displays unresolved line widths and appears to connect the two systems , suggesting an ongoing interaction .",
    "the expanding radio source strongly influences the properties of the surrounding eelr .",
    "in addition to the usual signs of interactions between eelr and the radio source , for pks1932 - 46 , the eelr morphology appears to trace the edges of the western radio lobe .",
    "however , these two eelrs are far more extreme than those typically observed around sources at these redshifts . both pks1932 - 464 and pks2250 - 41 display a number of features suggestive of galaxy interactions : extensive gaseous halos , large - scale rotating structures and close companion galaxies at similar redshifts . in the case of pks1932 - 46",
    ", the companion galaxy is actively forming stars , as are many of the knots in the eelr .",
    "we suggest that both sources lie in rich , merger environments , and that a large proportion of the eelr material may originate from the tidal debris of previous interactions  which may , plausibly , also have been responsible for triggering the current radio source activity .",
