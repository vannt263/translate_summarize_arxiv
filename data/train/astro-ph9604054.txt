    "26  is the first radioactive isotope which was detected by its  line emission in the interstellar medium ( @xcite ) . with its short lifetime of @xmath0 yrs",
    ", it is a clear tracer of ongoing nucleosynthesis in our galaxy .",
    "26  is assumed to be produced in various sites , such as core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) , wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars , o - ne - mg novae , and asymptotic giant - branch ( agb ) stars ( see review of @xcite ) .",
    "after two years of observations , the imaging telescope comptel aboard the cgro satellite revealed the first map of the milky way in the light of the 26  decay line at 1.809  ( @xcite ) .",
    "the sky map clearly shows that the emission is confined to the galactic plane . besides the important emission from the central galactic radian ,",
    "1.8  emission is seen in the direction of cygnus , vela , and near the anticentre .",
    "one of the most prominent features is found at @xmath1 in the direction of carina . among all features in the map it appears to be the most concentrated one , and",
    "additionally it lies in a nearly emission free region of the plane .",
    "we present here a detailed study of this region and discuss the potential source candidates .",
    "comptel allows the study of 1.8  line emission with an energy resolution of @xmath2 ( fwhm ) and an angular resolution of 1.6(@xmath3 ) within a wide field of view of about 1 steradian . for an observation time of @xmath4 seconds",
    "a  line sensitivity of some @xmath5  is obtained .",
    "incoming  photons are measured by their consecutive interactions in two parallel detector planes where an incident photon is first compton scattered in the upper layer and then absorbed ( although often not completely ) in the lower layer . from the energy deposits and the interaction location in both layers , the compton scatter angle  and the scatter direction ( @xmath6 ) are calculated , which span the three - dimensional imaging data - space .",
    "a detailed description of the instrument can be found in schnfelder  ( 1993 ) .",
    "for the 1.8  line analysis , only events in a 200  wide energy window centred on 1.8  are used .",
    "the majority of the registered photons ( @xmath7 ) are due to instrumental background .",
    "we estimated their distribution in the data - space by measurements at adjacent energy intervals which we corrected for the energy dependence of the compton scatter angle  ( @xcite ) .",
    "data - space analysis in this approach suppresses the continuum emission and reveals only pure 1.8  line emission .",
    "we used data from cgro observation phases i+ii ( may 1991 - august 1993 ) for our analysis . during this period ,",
    "the carina region was in the field of view for @xmath8 days , although half of the time at rather large aspect angles .",
    "( 8.8,5 ) ( 8.8,5 )    ( 8.8,8.8 ) ( 0,0)(8.8,8.8 )    two different techniques were used to derive the 1.8  flux and the extension of the emission in carina .",
    "first , we applied the maximum entropy method ( @xcite ) to reconstruct a deconvolved 1.8  intensity map of the carina region . from integration of the sky map over circular areas with increasing radii , centered on the emission maximum at @xmath1",
    ", we obtained a ` growth curve ' of the 1.8  emission ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : flux ] ) .",
    "it shows that most of the emission lies within a radius of @xmath9 around the maximum which is consistent with the appearance of a point source .",
    "the flatness of the growth curve between 2  and 7  demonstrates that the emission feature is isolated in a region free of 1.8 emission . from the plateau in the growth curve",
    "we infer a total flux of @xmath10  for the entire emission feature .",
    "the statistical flux error was derived by means of a bootstrap analysis ( @xcite ) .",
    "secondly , we used the maximum likelihood technique ( @xcite ) to test for the statistical significance of the 1.8  detection and to constrain the true emission diameter . in this approach , a point - source or an alternate model",
    "is convolved into the data - space which is then fitted together with the instrumental background model to the data .",
    "we scanned the carina region with a point - source hypothesis and present the result as a significance sky map in fig .",
    "[ fig : carreg ] .",
    "the highest evidence for 1.8  emission is found at @xmath1 with a detection significance of @xmath11 over background .",
    "we obtained from the fit a 1.8  flux of @xmath12 which is consistent with the maximum entropy result .",
    "we estimated the extension of the emission by a fit of extended symmetric source models of different radii to the data .",
    "the best fit was found for a point source hypothesis . from the decrease of the likelihood with increasing source radius , we derive an upper limit of 5.6",
    "( @xmath13 ) for the true diameter of the 1.8  emission .",
    "( 18,7.23 ) ( 0,3.90)(18,3.33 ) ( 0,0)(18,3.9 ) ( 0,0)(18,7.23 )    the point - like appearance of the 1.8  emission in carina restricts the possibilities for its origin .",
    "if the feature is produced by a single object , it must be rather nearby because the 26  yield which is expected for individual sources is relatively low . assuming a rather optimistic nova yield for 26  of @xmath14 as determined recently for the most promising subtype of o - ne - mg novae ( @xcite ) one obtains a maximum nova distance of 20  pc for the measured flux of @xmath15 .",
    "an agb star with 26  yield in the range of @xmath16 to @xmath5  ( @xcite ) should be not at distances above 60  pc , and also a massive wr star or sn with 26  yields up to @xmath17 ( @xcite , @xcite ) must be closer than 600  pc . additionally , all potential sources eject 26  at rather high velocities in the ism , either by stellar winds or explosions .",
    "this implies that bubbles or shells of ejected matter build up around these objects with radii in the order of 10 pc ( @xcite ) .",
    "accordingly , the 1.8  emission should also be extended for such nearby objects , and the radius of the observed emission severely constrains the age of the 26  ejection .    within the error region of the 1.8  emission feature",
    ", we found no indication of an 26  candidate source which fulfills the above constraints .",
    "thus , the source in carina is probably not a single object but rather a sum of more objects .",
    "it is hard to explain how novae and low- or intermediate - mass agb stars could accumulate so that they produce the observed feature .",
    "their 26  yield is relatively small which would require a large number of them within a small galactic area to produce the observed 1.8 emission .",
    "their evolution time from birth until 26  ejection , however , is longer than the galactic revolution period of @xmath18  yrs which leads to a dispersion of these objects in the galactic disk and hence to a rather smooth emission profile .",
    "high - mass stars , on the other hand , are known to be produced in groups which are visible as ob - associations and open clusters ( @xcite ) . the short massive - star lifetime of @xmath19  yrs ( @xcite )",
    "assures that the 26  is ejected soon after birth of the star and thus remains confined to the cluster region .",
    "typical diameters of ob - associations are around 100  pc ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , if the observed 1.8  emission in carina originates from such an association , the upper limit for the emission diameter of 5.6  implies a lower limit for the association distance of 1  kpc .",
    "the 26  yield of massive stars is relatively high , hence only a moderate number of individual source objects is needed . assuming a typical wr star or sne yield of @xmath20 ( @xcite , @xcite ) and an association distance of 1  kpc , the measured 1.8  flux requires 26  ejection from only 30 ( average ) massive stars within the last million years .",
    "therefore we feel that massive stars which are confined to stellar clusters are the most probable source of the 1.8  emission in carina . using the stellar lifetimes of schaller  ( 1992 )",
    "one finds that in clusters younger than @xmath21  myr , only wr stars and sne should contribute significantly to an 26  enrichment , while in clusters with ages between 20 to 100 myr the massive agb stars should be the dominant sources of 26 .      in order to substantiate these considerations , we investigated the open cluster content of the carina region .",
    "the most comprehensive data - base of open clusters was compiled by lyng ( 1987 ) . for clusters younger than 20/100 myr",
    "it is found to be complete up to distances of 2.3/1.6 kpc , respectively ( @xcite ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lynga ] we show the distribution of the clusters along the galactic plane , separated in clusters younger than 20 myr ( upper panel ) and clusters with age estimates of 20 - 100 myr ( lower panel ) .",
    "the largest concentration of clusters younger than 20 myr is found in the direction of carina near @xmath22 within a radius of about 3 .",
    "its position and extension is consistent with the observed 1.8 feature .",
    "there is no other region with similar high cluster content , neither in the 0 - 20 myr nor in the 20 - 100 myr age range .",
    "we found 31 clusters in lyng s catalogue which lie within the error - box of the 1.8  emission feature from which 14 have age estimates below 20 myr , one falls in the age interval 20 - 100 myr , 4 are older than 100 myr and 12 are without age estimates .",
    "the remarkable correlation of the carina feature with open clusters younger than 20 myr strongly suggests that wr stars and sne in these clusters are the origin of the observed 1.8  emission .",
    "the carina region is not only the region with the highest concentration of young open clusters , it also houses one of the most prominent regions of the galaxy : the carina nebula ngc 3372 .",
    "ngc 3372 is assumed to be powered by the four hot star clusters tr 14 , tr 15 , tr 16 and cr 228 ( @xcite ) .",
    "these clusters comprise the largest concentration ( six ) of o3 stars known in the galaxy , three wr stars , and the remarkable luminous blue variable ( lbv ) .",
    "together with some other young clusters , they form the car ob1 association whose photospectrometric distance has been estimated to be @xmath23 kpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , if the observed 1.8  emission comes from this association , the measured flux implies a total 26  mass of @xmath24  in that region .",
    "the presence of evolved stars like  and the wr stars in car ob1 indicates that 26  was ejected in the recent past to the ism",
    ". for , langer  ( 1995 ) estimated a total 26  ejection of @xmath17  which excludes it as the only source responsible for the observed emission . also the three wr stars with typical yields of @xmath25",
    "fail to explain the measured flux .",
    "the large number of o3 stars , however , suggests that very massive stars are not exceptional in car ob1 and other stars possibly experienced similar stages in the recent past .",
    "some stars may already have finished their life and ejected 26  in a supernova explosion .",
    "though under debate , there are indications of recent supernova activity in the carina nebula from observations of large scale motions ( @xcite ) , non - thermal radio emission ( @xcite ) , and x - ray emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "we presently exploit a full stellar evolution model for the clusters in carina to estimate the total 26  input in the recent past ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , it remains questionable whether the young open clusters of the car ob1 association can explain all of the measured 1.8  flux , which would require about 20 lbvs like , 100 wr stars , or 200 sne in the last @xmath4 yrs , respectively .",
    "there may be additional similar regions rich in massive stars along the line of sight which contribute to the observed emission .",
    "this possibility is suggested from the fact , that a galactic spiral arm is seen tangentially in the direction of carina ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "regions together with their exciting young open clusters are generally associated with the spiral structure ( @xcite ) . in this context",
    "it should be mentioned that 3 of the 5 known galactic lbvs ( @xcite ) are found in carina , being all consistent with the observed emission feature .",
    "this indicates that evolved extremely massive stars are indeed present behind car ob1 whose ejected 26  should contribute to the observed 1.8  emission .",
    "prominent 1.8  line emission which is attributed to the radioactive decay of 26  was detected from the carina region by the imaging telescope comptel .",
    "we find a remarkable correlation of the 1.8  feature with a concentration of open clusters younger than 20 myr which suggests that wr stars and core collapse sne are the origin of the observed emission .",
    "the presence of evolved objects in the carina clusters clearly indicates recent 26  ejection to the ism .",
    "this region demonstrates that ob - associations and young open clusters could be a natural explanation for some of the emission features and ` hot - spots ' in the comptel 1.8  sky - map .",
    "especially noncoeval star - formation can produce veritable starbursts ( @xcite ) which would result in substantial concentrations of 26  within a localized region .",
    "if such a burst occurred within the last million years it could be observable through its strongly peaked 1.8  emission .",
    "we will investigate further regions of peaked 1.8  emission to verify this hypothesis ."
