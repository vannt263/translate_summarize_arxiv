    "the solar system today is embedded in a warm low density interstellar cloud ( t@xmath27000 k , n(h@xmath5+h@xmath6)@xmath20.3 @xmath3 ) , which flows through the solar system with a relative sun - cloud velocity of @xmath226 km s@xmath7 .",
    "neutral interstellar gas penetrates the charged solar wind of the heliosphere ",
    "98% of the diffuse material in the heliosphere is interstellar gas , and the densities of neutral interstellar gas and the solar wind are equal at approximately the orbit of jupiter .",
    "the galactic environment of the sun is regulated by the properties of the interstellar cloud surrounding the solar system . however , when the surrounding cloud is of low density , the solar wind prevents most interstellar gas and dust from reaching 1 au , the location of the earth .",
    "the discovery of small scale structure with column densities @xmath8 10@xmath9 @xmath10 in cold interstellar matter ( @xcite ) , and the structured nature of the interstellar cloud surrounding the solar system , allow the possibility that the spatial density of the interstellar cloud surrounding the solar system may change within the next 10@xmath1110@xmath12 years ( frisch 1995,1997a,1997b,1998 ; hereafter referred to as fr ) . over the past century",
    ", many conjectures have appeared in the scientific literature linking encounters with dense interstellar clouds to possible climate changes on earth ( e.g.  shapely 1921 ; mccrea 1975 ; begelman and rees 1976 ; fahr 1968 ; reid et al .",
    "1976 ; mckay and thomas 1978 ; scoville and sanders 1986 ; thaddeus 1986 ; @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) . for these suggestions to have substance , however , it must first be shown that the interplanetary environment of the earth varies with changing properties of the surrounding interstellar cloud .",
    "it has been shown that in the past , the galactic environment of the sun has changed as a function of time , and that the cloud complex sweeping past the sun now has an order - of - magnitude more nearby interstellar gas in the upwind than the downwind directions ( @xcite , fr ) .",
    "therefore the sensitivity of the heliosphere to variations in the boundary conditions imposed by the lism justify closer examination .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to show that even a moderate alteration in the density of the cloud surrounding the solar system can yield substantial variations to the interplanetary environment in the inner heliosphere .",
    "early studies investigating a heliosphere embedded in a dense interstellar cloud considered the relative ram pressures of the solar wind and surrounding interstellar cloud to estimate the heliopause location ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "contemporary models consider the interaction of the solar wind and interstellar medium ( ism ) self - consistently , by including the effects of resonant charge exchange between the ionized and neutral gases . in the supersonic solar wind itself",
    ", charge - exchange can lead to a significant deceleration of the wind due to the freshly ionized interstellar neutrals extracting momentum from the solar wind .",
    "the concomitant reduction in solar wind ram pressure can lead to a significant reduction in the size of the heliospheric cavity . in the boundary region separating the solar wind from the ism ( the `` heliosheath '' ) , neutral hydrogen charge exchange with decelerated interstellar plasma acts to partially divert , heat and filter the h@xmath0 before it enters the heliosphere .",
    "this filtration of h@xmath0 in the heliosheath can reduce the number density of inflowing h@xmath0 by almost half .",

    "the weak coupling of neutral hydrogen gas and plasma via resonant charge exchange affects both distributions in important ways .",
    "this implies that the self - consistent coupling of plasma and neutral hydrogen is necessary for modelling the interaction of the solar wind with the ism .",

    "a multi - fluid model is used here to model the interaction of the solar wind with cloud of enhanced density .",
    "the need for modelling the neutrals as a multi - fluid stems from the variation in the charge exchange mean - free - path for h in different regions of the heliosphere and ism .",
    "large anisotropies are introduced in the neutral gas distribution by charge exchange with the solar wind plasma ( both sub- and supersonic regions ) and the multi - fluid approach represents an attempt to capture this characteristic in a tractable and computationally efficient manner .",
    "we consider the interaction of the heliosphere with an interstellar cloud similar to the cloud now surrounding the solar system , but with neutral number densities increased to 10 @xmath3 .",

    "the collisional mean - free - path for h@xmath0 with the given input parameters ranges from less than 2 au in the ism to less than 1 au in the heliospheric boundary regions ( below ) to less than 2.5 au in the heliosphere itself .",
    "this suggests that the multi - fluid description outlined below is suitable on scales larger than a few au for these moderate ism densities , and this , as illustrated below , is shown to be the case .",
    "the heliosphere - ism environment can be described in terms of three thermodynamically distinct regions ; the supersonic solar wind ( region 3 ) , the very hot subsonic solar wind ( region 2 ) , and the ism itself ( region 1 ) .",
    "each region acts a source of secondary h@xmath0 atoms whose distribution reflects that of the plasma distribution in the region .",
    "accordingly , the neutral distribution resulting from the interaction of the solar wind with the surrounding interstellar cloud may be approximated by three distinct neutral components originating from each region ( zank et al .",
    "each of these three neutral components is represented by a distinct maxwellian distribution function appropriate to the characteristics of the source distribution in the multi - fluid models .",
    "this approximation allows the use of simpler production and loss terms for each neutral component .",
    "the complete highly non - maxwellian h distribution function is then the sum over the three components , @xmath23 in principle , for each component , an integral equation must be solved ( hall 1992 ; zank et al .",
    "1996b ) . instead , zank et al . use ( [ eq:3.1 ] ) to obtain three boltzmann equations corresponding to each neutral component",
    "this is an extension of the procedure developed in pauls et al .",
    "for component 1 , both losses and gains in the interstellar medium need to be included , but only losses are needed in the heliosheath and solar wind .",
    "similarly for components 2 and 3 . thus , for each of the neutral hydrogen components @xmath24 ( @xmath25 or 3 ) @xmath26 and @xmath27 means that the production or source term @xmath28 is to be evaluated for the parameters of components 1 , 2 , or 3 respectively .",

    "1996a for a discussion about a subsonic ism ) , a bow shock , labelled bs in plate 1a , forms , which decelerates , heats and diverts the interstellar plasma around the heliospheric obstacle .",
    "the plasma is now no longer collisionally equilibrated with the interstellar h@xmath0 and charge exchange between the interstellar plasma and neutrals just downstream of the bow shock leads to an effective heating / compression and diversion of the neutral interstellar h in the heliosheath region ( between the bow shock and heliopause ) . as a result , a pile - up of decelerated , diverted and heated interstellar h@xmath0 is created in the region downstream of the bow shock , which is illustrated in plate 2 .",
    "plate 2 shows the corresponding global distribution of h@xmath0 at the same times as used in plate 1 , except that the h@xmath0 density is plotted .",
    "far upstream of the bow shock , the h@xmath0 number density is @xmath44 @xmath14 , increasing rapidly just downstream of the bow shock in the pile - up region with densities 22.5 times greater than the ambient ism density .",
    "changes in the neutral number density , velocity , temperature and mach number are seen more easily in the one - dimensional ( 1d ) plots along the stagnation axis than in plate 2 ( discussed later in the context of figure 2 ) .",
    "the number density of neutrals entering the heliosphere at @xmath45 au is @xmath46 @xmath3 , decreasing to @xmath47 @xmath3 at 1 au .",
    "the enhanced - density ism case can be compared to simulations using the current low - density surrounding ism ( the lic column of table 1 ) .",
    "the hydrogen wall of the high density cloud model possesses a more complicated structure than that of the low density case  it possesses a weak double - peaked structure along the stagnation axis in the upstream direction , reverts to a single - peaked structure away from but in the neighbourhood of the stagnation axis ,",
    "after which it again becomes double - peaked .",
    "the h@xmath0 flow is strongly filtered in the vicinity of the wall , this due essentially to the divergence of the h@xmath0 flow through charge exchange with the bow shock - diverted interstellar plasma , thus leading to an h@xmath0 number density entering the heliosphere that is much lower than that of the ism .    as is well - known ( e.g. holzer 1972 )",
    ", the effect of interstellar h streaming through the supersonic solar wind , and experiencing charge exchange with solar wind protons , is to reduce the momentum of the solar wind significantly .",
    "the relatively large h@xmath0 number density entering the heliosphere reduces the solar wind ram pressure significantly , 25%75% , from its nominal non - mediated value thereby reducing the global extent of the heliosphere . for the parameters of table 1 , the heliosphere shrinks dramatically to @xmath44  14 au in the upstream direction .",
    "the density of interstellar neutral hydrogen at 1 au becomes @xmath2 2 @xmath3 ( figure 2 ) , unlike the current state for which no neutral interstellar hydrogen reaches earth orbit ( e.g. @xcite ; zank et al .",
    ", 1996a ) .",
    "in addition , the configuration becomes unstable ( see below ) .",
    "the reduction in solar wind momentum is accompanied by an increase in the total temperature of the solar wind ( solar wind ions plus pickup ions ) , in comparison to an adiabatically expanding solar wind , since pickup ions acquire a large velocity perpendicular to both the solar wind velocity and magnetic field vectors and therefore have energies that are typically @xmath48 kev in the unmediated solar wind ( where @xmath49 km s@xmath7 ) . accordingly , beyond the ionization cavity ( a cavity created by the photoionization of interstellar neutrals by solar wind uv radiation ) , the solar wind temperature increases ( in the absence of pickup ions , the total solar wind temperature decays adiabatically , the polytropic index depending on the nature of the specific heat sources identified to heat the wind ) .",
    "radial cuts along the stagnation axis for the plasma density , velocity , temperature , and mach number are illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "the increase in the solar wind temperature is evident in figure 1c .",
    "by contrast , in the absence of pickup ions or other heating processes , the solar wind temperature would cool adiabatically according to @xmath50 for an adiabatic index of 5/3 .",
    "the very high number density of interstellar neutrals entering the heliosphere , even after filtration ( @xmath46 @xmath14 , plate 2 , figure 2a ) leads to a very strong time - dependent mediation of the solar wind . in the sequence of velocity profiles plotted in figure 1b ( the sequence corresponds to the four plot sequence of plates 1 and 2 ) ,",
    "the solar wind at the time corresponding to the solid line is decelerated from 400 km s@xmath7 to @xmath51 km s@xmath7 at the termination shock .",
    "some 66 days later ( the dashed line ) , the deceleration is considerably larger , now down to @xmath52 km s@xmath7 .",
    "neutrals that were ionized and then picked up by the solar wind during the least mediated solar wind period will therefore have considerably more energy than those picked up by a strongly mediated wind ( a factor @xmath44 difference ) .",
    "thus , the strongly mediated solar wind will possess a very large temperature gradient .",
    "the temperature gradient can become so large that the pressure gradient , which normally decreases with increasing radial distance in weakly mediated solar wind , is now inward ( figure 3 ) , and it is this inwardly directed pressure gradient that is responsible for decelerating the outwardly flowing solar wind so strongly . as a result of the much stronger deceleration of the solar wind , the radial solar wind density profile departs from an @xmath53 dependence ( figure 1a ) on occasion .",
    "once the solar wind is mediated strongly by pickup ions ( the dashed curve , figure 1 ) , the newly born ions are much less energetic and no longer contribute as strongly to the temperature and pressure build - up in the outer heliosphere . consequently , the outer heliosphere begins to cool , the inwardly directed pressure gradient is reduced , and the solar wind begins to revert to a less strongly mediated state . in the simulation ,",
    "the periodic weak and strong mediation of the solar wind is very evident when the results are plotted in a movie format , and temperature fronts are seen to propagate continually out of the solar wind .",
    "this can be seen in the temperature sequence of plate 1 .",
    "the numerical simulations have been run for very long times , but no abatement of the temporal behaviour is observed . essentially , the number density of neutrals entering the heliosphere is far too large to allow the solar wind to ever settle into a steady or quasi - steady state . the large neutral number density forces the wind to deviate strongly from its zeroth - order unmediated state , which in turn drives strong variations in the heating effects introduced by pickup ions .    associated with the periodic increase of plasma temperature in the outer heliosphere",
    "is a decrease of the solar wind mach number .",
    "the mach number , which decreases in a pickup ion mediated solar wind because of both the solar wind deceleration and the increased sound speed , normally remains larger than 1 ( supersonic ) .",
    "however , the strongly mediated solar wind mach number decreases to 1 and less ( figure 1d ) . in this case , a termination shock is no longer necessary to bound the solar wind and a shock - free transition from supersonic to subsonic flow occurs ( plate 1b ) . as the outer heliospheric temperature begins to decrease again , the mach number increases and a termination shock is again present .",
    "the sequence showing the presence of a termination shock , then a shock - free transition , followed by the reformation of the termination shock is exhibited in plate 1a , b , and c respectively .",
    "finally , it should be noted that the heliopause region is unstable to a rayleigh - taylor - like instability .",
    "this is discussed in more detail in zank ( 1998b ) but the effect is understood easily .",
    "the coupling of neutral interstellar h to plasma introduces a frictional term proportional to @xmath54 in the momentum balance , where @xmath55 denotes the charge exchange cross - section , @xmath56 the neutral number density , @xmath57 the neutral velocity , and @xmath58 and @xmath59 the plasma variables density and velocity .",
    "this expression is somewhat simplified compared to the full expressions used in the simulation .",
    "the inwardly directed frictional term plays a similar role as the gravitational term in the classical rayleigh - taylor analysis ( e.g. chandrasekhar 1961 ) and the charge - exchange ion - neutral friction term can therefore destabilize the heliopause .",
    "this leads to a somewhat unstable flow pattern in the upstream region , and some mixing of the solar wind and interstellar plasma .    in plate 2 ,",
    "the global neutral distribution is also time - dependent but much more weakly than the plasma .",
    "plate 2 suggests that the overall structure of the heliospheric hydrogen wall does not change very significantly with time .",
    "it is shown in this paper , using a coupled time - dependent system of hydrodynamic equations to describe the interaction between the heliosphere and a partially ionized interstellar cloud , that the configuration of the heliosphere and the interplanetary environment of the earth are sensitive to the density of neutrals in the interstellar cloud surrounding the sun . raising the neutral number density in the surrounding cloud to @xmath44 @xmath3 , and leaving the other parameters at current values ,",
    "has a dramatic effect on the global spatial and temporal structure of the heliosphere .",
    "the heliosphere in the upstream direction is reduced in extent to @xmath21014 au , compared to @xmath60 - @xmath2120 au currently .",
    "interstellar h@xmath0 is filtered considerably as it enters the heliosphere , but some survives to penetrate successfully to 1 au where interstellar h@xmath0 densities are @xmath22 @xmath3 , unlike the current conditions for which interstellar hydrogen is ionized entirely a few au from the sun .",
    "although we have changed only the density of the surrounding cloud in these simulations , denser interstellar clouds are expected to have somewhat higher magnetic field strengths than the low value found locally .",
    "an average value of 7.3@xmath61 g has been found recently for neutral interstellar gas from zeeman splitting ( @xcite ) . were the interstellar magnetic field strength also to be increased to 7@xmath61 g in our simulations",
    ", we would expect the heliopause radius to decrease possibly to a half to a third ( depending on magnetic field orientation ) of our computed radius , using a very crude balance estimate .",
    "the heliospheric configuration becomes unstable ; properties of the solar wind in the outer heliosphere vary on timescales as short as @xmath43 days , and the termination shock disappears at times .",
    "the formation , disappearance and reformation of the termination shock appears to be periodic with a timescale of @xmath62 days .",
    "pickup ions dominate the thermodynamical character of the outer heliospheric solar wind completely .",
    "solar wind temperatures , when pickup ions are included , can exceed @xmath19 k. an inward pressure gradient can develop , which causes the solar wind to decelerate far more than predicted by simple mass - loading arguments and , consequently , the density decrease with increasing heliocentric distance can deviate from the usual @xmath63 dependence .",
    "the implications of high interstellar neutral densities at 1 au for the terrestrial environment are interesting ( e.g. , begelman and rees , 1976 ; @xcite ) .",
    "is there evidence that the earth has passed through a dense interstellar cloud in the ( pre-)historical past , or might do so in the near future ?",
    "a cloud condensation with density @xmath210 @xmath3 embedded in the interstellar cloud complex flowing past the solar system could have a thickness of up to 0.3 pc and not violate any known observational constraints .",
    "such a condensation would pass over the solar system in less than 15,000 years .",
    "there are several sets of data that indicate that the galactic environment of the sun may have changed recently .",
    "the first set are geological records of nitrate layers @xmath2 11000 years before present , which have been attributed to energetic photons released by the vela supernova explosion ( @xcite ; also see @xcite ) .",
    "the second set of data is absorption line measurements of a slightly denser and cooler interstellar cloud seen within 3 pc of the sun towards the stars @xmath64 cma and @xmath65 cma in the anti - apex direction ( see the discussion of the distribution of the nearby ism in frisch 1997b ) .",
    "the second cloud at @xmath217 km s@xmath7 ( heliocentric velocity , sometimes referred to as the `` blue - shifted '' cloud ) has an electron density n(e@xmath66@xmath20.4 @xmath3 , and temperature t=3600 k , in comparison with the values @xmath20.10.2 @xmath3 and 7000 k seen locally ( @xcite ) .",
    "a third kind evidence is the cosmic ray record implied by the spikes in the @xmath67be record found in antarctic ice core samples at ages corresponding to 33 000 and 60 000 years ago ( the d1 and d2 events respectively ) .",
    "raisbeck et al .",
    "( 1987 ) and sonett et al .",
    "( 1987 ) suggest that an increase in the cosmic ray flux on the earth s atmosphere can lead to an enhancement in the precipitated beryllium .",
    "since supernova remnant shocks are thought to be responsible for accelerating galactic cosmic rays up to energies of @xmath68 ev per nucleii , sonett et al.suggested that the spikes might correspond to the passage of supernova shocks through the heliosphere .",
    "however , frisch ( 1997a ) has argued that little observational evidence in the lism exists for the presence of a supernova shock at the times needed to explain the @xmath4be enhancements .",
    "we suggest below an alternative interpretation of the @xmath4be enhancements .",
    "there are two possible ways that the cosmic ray flux at 1 au can be increased by the interaction of the solar wind with a dense interstellar cloud .",
    "the first is that the increased pickup ion population increases the anomalous cosmic ray population .",
    "the second is that the reduction in the size of the heliospheric cavity indicates that galactic cosmic rays are no longer modulated significantly by an extended solar wind and so , at 1 au , the earth samples the full spectrum .",
    "a more quantitative connection between the anomalous cosmic ray flux and a high density neutral interstellar cloud can be made using the model discussed above .",
    "the pickup ion number density at the termination shock , located at @xmath45  14 au , may be estimated as @xmath69 @xmath3 ( after solving @xmath70 , under the assumptions that the solar wind number density @xmath71 on average , @xmath72 @xmath73 , and using figure 2a ) .",
    "the injection of pickup ions into the anomalous cosmic ray component at a quasi - perpendicular termination shock has been considered by zank et al .",
    "( 1996c ) and lee et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . on the basis of such a shock `` surfing '' , or multiply reflected ion acceleration mechanism , zank et al . estimated an injection efficiency of @xmath74% for hydrogen , with correspondingly smaller values for the heavier pickup ions .",
    "thus , the number density of anomalous cosmic rays at 10 au for a heliosphere embedded in a h@xmath0 interstellar cloud of density 10 @xmath3 is @xmath75 @xmath3 . to determine the cosmic ray density at 1 au",
    ", we can use a simple convection - diffusion solution to the cosmic ray transport equation , @xmath76 $ ] where @xmath77 is the radial diffusion coefficient for cosmic rays in the heliosphere . using an estimate for",
    "the radial mean free path @xmath78 au for 100 mv rigidity ions ( zank et al .",
    "1998 ) yields @xmath79 @xmath14 .",
    "this is a very high level indeed .",
    "with such a large flux of anomalous cosmic rays incident on the atmosphere of the earth , one might therefore expect a noticeable enhancement in the @xmath4be flux measured on earth .",
    "this effect will be further enhanced by the reduced modulation of galactic cosmic rays in the smaller heliosphere .",
    "this alternative explanation for the @xmath67be spikes offers a natural explanation for the absence of @xmath4be enhancements prior to the d2 event in terms of the recent history of the galactic environment of the sun ( @xcite ) . during those periods",
    "when the heliosphere is embedded in an interstellar cloud with appreciable densities of h@xmath0 , the anomalous and galactic cosmic ray fluxes incident on the earth s atmosphere will increase and enhance the level of precipitated @xmath4be . during the time prior to the d2 event ( 60 000 years ago ) , the sun was in the third - quadrant void where the heliosphere would have been at least as large as today ( @xcite ) , entering the local fluff cloud complex only within the last @xmath80 years .",
    "the effect of a large population of h@xmath0 atoms filling interplanetary space at 1 au may well affect the interaction of the terrestrial magnetosphere with the solar wind , since interstellar he@xmath0 densities will increase to @xmath21 @xmath3 at 1 au for this increased density case and be comparable to the density of interstellar h@xmath0 atoms .",
    "in addition , enhanced cosmic ray fluxes at 1 au may alter the global electric circuit , since the cosmic ray flux is the dominant source of conductivity in the lower atmosphere ( @xcite ) ; the global electrical circuit has been postulated to play a role in the terrestial climate ( tinsley 1994,1997 ) .",

    "<S> the interaction of the heliosphere with interstellar clouds has attracted interest since the late 1920 s , both with a view to explaining apparent quasi - periodic climate `` catastrophes '' as well as periodic mass extinctions . until recently , however , models describing the solar wind - local interstellar medium ( lism ) interaction self - consistently had not been developed . here </S>",
    "<S> , we describe the results of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) simulation of the interaction between the heliosphere and an interstellar cloud with the same properties as currently , except that the h@xmath0 density is increased from the present value of @xmath1(h@xmath0)@xmath20.2 @xmath3 to 10 @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the mutual interaction of interstellar neutral hydrogen and plasma is included . </S>",
    "<S> the heliospheric cavity is reduced considerably in size ( approximately 10  14 au to the termination shock in the upstream direction ) and is highly dynamical . </S>",
    "<S> the interplanetary environment at the orbit of the earth changes markedly , with the density of interstellar h@xmath0 increasing to @xmath22 @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the termination shock itself experiences periods where it disappears , reforms and disappears again . </S>",
    "<S> considerable mixing of the shocked solar wind and lism occurs due to rayleigh - taylor - like instabilities at the nose , driven by ion - neutral friction . </S>",
    "<S> implications for two anomalously high concentrations of @xmath4be found in antarctic ice cores 33 kya and 60 kya , and the absence of prior similar events , are discussed in terms of density enhancements in the surrounding interstellar cloud . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation presented here supports past speculation that the galactic environment of the sun moderates the interplanetary environment at the orbit of the earth , and possibly also the terrestrial climate . </S>"
