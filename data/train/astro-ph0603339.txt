    "the iron k@xmath0 emission line at @xmath1 6.4 kev was first identified as a common feature in the x - ray spectrum of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) by _ ginga _ ( pounds et al .",
    "1990 ; nandra & pounds 1994 ) . its origin can be promptly interpreted as fluorescence emission following photoelectric absorption of the hard x - ray continuum ( see reynolds & nowak 2003 for a review ) . in 1995 , _ asca _ observation of mcg6 - 30 - 15 yielded a broadened and skewed iron k@xmath0 line profile ( tanaka et al .",
    "the line profile was successfully interpreted as fluorescence line from the innermost region of an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole .",
    "this is the first direct evidence of emission from an accretion disk extending down to a few schwarzschild radii .",
    "thereafter , the iron k@xmath0 emission line became one of the major targets of x - ray astronomy studies .",
    "recent _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ observations revealed narrow ( unresolved by _ xmm _ ) iron k@xmath0 lines at @xmath1 6.4kev in the x - ray spectra of most agns ( e.g. yaqoob & padmanabhan 2004 ; page et al .",
    "contrary to previous low - resolution _ asca _ observations , broad iron emission lines appear to be much rarer in _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ spectra .",
    "different from the broad line profile , which comes from the innermost region of the accretion disk , the narrow iron k@xmath0 is believed to be due to emission from neutral iron far from the inner accretion disk .",
    "possible origins of the narrow line include the outermost regions of the accretion disk , the broad line region , and the putative molecular torus .    in 1993 ,",
    "an x - ray baldwin effect in the iron k lines was found in _",
    "observations of 37 agn ( iwasawa & taniguchi 1993 ) .",
    "they found the equivalent width ( ew ) of the iron k line is anti - correlated to the x - ray continuum luminosity ( ew @xmath1 l@xmath5 ) . the trend was confirmed by later _",
    "asca _ observations of broad iron lines ( nandra et al . 1997 ) .",
    "such an effect can be explained due to the presence of an ionized skin on the accretion disk , with the degree of ionization increasing with luminosity ( see nayakshin 2000a , b ) .",
    "an x - ray baldwin effect was also reported for the narrow iron k@xmath0 line observed by _ xmm - newton _",
    "( page et al . 2004a ; zhou & wang 2005 ) .",
    "since the narrow line is produced much far away from the inner x - ray continuum source , such an effect can not be due to the change of the ionization state of the line emitting clouds .",
    "a possible explanation is a decrease in the covering factor of the material forming the fluorescence line ( such as the torus ) with increasing x - ray luminosity .",
    "if true , such a result supports the scheme that the lack of a large population of obscured quasars ( luminous agns ) now discovered is due to the smaller covering factor of the torus in quasars ( for example , the receding torus model , see simpson 2005 ) .",
    "however , the x - ray baldwin effect of the narrow iron k@xmath0 line was questioned by _ xmm - newton _ observations of pg quasars . jim@xmath6nez - bail@xmath7n et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found the narrow iron k@xmath0 lines in pg quasars are similar to those of seyfert galaxies , and no x - ray baldwin effect was found .",
    "we also note that while some studies show that the fraction of obscured agn significantly decreases with luminosity ( e.g. , ueda et al . 2003 ; steffen et al .",
    "2003 ) , some other studies yield contrary results supporting the existence of a large population of obscured quasars ( e.g. martnez - sansigre et al . 2005 ; tozzi et al .",
    "note a most recent work ( markwardt et al .",
    "2005 ) studied the population of obscured agn in swift / bat all sky survey and found a significant reduction in the fraction of absorbed / obscured agn at higher luminosities .    in this paper",
    "we revisit this issue by studying archival agn spectra obtained by _ chandra",
    "_ high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ) , which has better spectral resolution in the iron line band for more accurate measurement of the narrow fe k line .",
    "we also combined our _ chandra _ sample with _",
    "observations in literature to build a much larger sample of 75 radio quiet and 26 radio loud agns .",
    "we found that the previous reported x - ray baldwin effect is mainly due to the radio loud sources in their sample , whose x - ray spectra might be contaminated by the relativistic jet .",
    "we found a much weaker x - ray baldwin effect of the narrow iron k@xmath0 line for radio quiet sample , however , we present simulations showing that such a weak anti - correlation is indistinguishable from an observational bias due to the variation of agn x - ray continuum . throughout this paper",
    ", h0 is taken to be 70 km @xmath8 mpc@xmath9 , @xmath10m=0.27 and @xmath10@xmath11=0.73 .",
    "we searched for archival _ chandra _ hetgs observations as of 2005 september 20 in the _ chandra _ archive database .",
    "the search revealed 89 hetgs observations of 44 type 1 seyfert galaxies and qsos .",
    "type 2 sources were excluded because for most of them it is difficult to measure the intrinsic x - ray luminosities due to strong absorption .",
    "hetgs consists of two grating assemblies , a high energy grating ( heg ) and a medium energy grating ( meg ) .",
    "our study will focus on the heg data , which have better spectral resolution and larger effective area in the fe k@xmath0 band .",
    "we also excluded 8 observations : mkn421 ( obsid 457 ) , pg 1404 + 226 ( 812 ) , 1h 070 - 495 ( 862 and 2304 ) , mcg5 - 23 - 16 ( 2121 - 1e and 2121 - 2e ) , 1h 0414 + 009 ( 2969 ) , mrk 705 ( 4914 ) , whose heg count rates are too low for spectral fitting , and 3 high redshift qsos ( q 0836 + 7104 , pks 2149 - 306 , pks 1830 - 211 ) because the center of their fe k@xmath0 lines in the observed frame were out of our restricted band ( mentioned below ) .",
    "finally , we obtained 74 observations of 34 seyfert 1 galaxies and qsos from _",
    "chandra_.    we used the first order of the heg grating data by combining the positive and negative arms .",
    "for the sources with multiple observations , we used the observation with the longest exposure time .",
    "we used xspec version 11.3.2l ( arnaud 1996 ) for spectral fitting . to utilizing the highest possible spectral resolution available ,",
    "we binned the spectra to the intrinsic resolution of the heg ( one bin is @xmath12 ) , and adopt the _ c_-statistic ( cash 1976 ) for minimization .",
    "our model is a power - law plus a gaussian emission line with possible intrinsic neutral absorption .",
    "the galactic absorption was also accounted .",
    "we restrict our fit to 2.5  8 .",
    "kev band to avoid possible complex absorption and/or soft excess at lower energy . during the fit",
    ", the background was subtracted .    for , , , , , , an fe k emission line was not detected .",
    "we obtained the upper limits on the equivalent width ( ew ) for such sources by fixing the line width to 1000 km @xmath8 and the rest frame line energy at 6.4 kev . for , , , , , , and the narrow emission line was not resolved , we thus gave constraints on the line energy and ew by fixing the line width to 1000 @xmath13 .",
    "for and obvious broad fe k line can be detected with fwhm @xmath14 10000 km @xmath8 , for which we also fixed the line width at 1000 km @xmath8 to measure the line flux of the narrow core .",
    "for whose fe k line profile is very complex , we used the luminosity and narrow line equivalent width obtained by yaqoob & padmanabhan ( 2004 ) directly . and for other unresolved objects ( , , and ) xspec could not give the best line energy while fixing the line width , so we also fixed the line energy . for other sources ,",
    "all three parameters of the gaussian line were set free during the fit .",
    "( see table [ tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "the astronomy survival analysis ( asurv ; feigelson & nelson , 1985 ) package can be used in the presence of censored ( upper limit ) data .",
    "this allows us to study the relationship between line ew and l2 - 10kev , including all significant and non - significant detections of the narrow lines .",
    "we performed the spearman rank ( sr ) statistic to give the correlation between ew and luminosity in log - log space , and performed the buckley - james method to find the slope of the best - fit line .",
    "figure 1a plots the rest frame ew of the narrow fe k@xmath0 line against the rest frame 2 .",
    "kev luminosity for _ chandra _ sources .",
    "it can be seen that the ew decreases with the increasing luminosity .",
    "the fit gives a power law index of @xmath15 ( spearman s coefficient rs = @xmath16 ) , where @xmath17 . the result is consistent with @xmath18 obtained by page et al .",
    "( 2004a ) . for our _ xmm - newton _ observationsnez - bail@xmath7n et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , page et al .",
    "( 2004b ) ] ( see table [ tbl-2 ] ) , the fit gives a similar index of @xmath19 ( rs= @xmath20 ) for the whole sample .",
    "however , when only the radio - quiet objects of the sample are considered ( figure 2b ) , the inverse correlation between ew and the luminosity becomes weaker ( @xmath21 , rs= @xmath22 ) .",
    "to better study the possible correlation , we combined our _ chandra _ sample with our _ xmm - newton _ sample to build a much larger sample with 75 radio quiet sources and 26 radio loud sources",
    ". there are 22 objects ( , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and ) included in both our _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ samples .",
    "figure 3a plots their _ chandra _ x - ray luminosities against _ xmm _ ones .",
    "clearly , there is no systematic bias between the observed luminosities by different instruments , however , 8 out of 22 sources show variation with amplitude above 1.5 . the relationship of line ew observed by _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm _ is plotted in figure 3b .",
    "we can see that most of ew observed by _",
    "are consistent with those observed by _",
    "xmm_. considering that _ chandra _ data has better spectral resolution in the fe k@xmath0 band , which is essential to measure the narrow line , we directly adopt _ chandra _ data for these 22 sources and drop _ xmm _ ones in the combined sample .",
    "figure 4 plots the correlation between the ew and luminosity for all objects in the large sample ( @xmath23 , rs = @xmath24 ) and for radio - quiet objects only ( @xmath25 , rs = @xmath26 ) .",
    "the fitting results are consistent with those derived from _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm _ data respectively .",
    "the values for three different samples are listed together in table [ tbl-3 ] .",
    "note for the chandra only sample , the difference between the correlation index from rq+rl sources and rq sources only is not obvious as for xmm and combined samples .",
    "this is mainly because that there is very limited number of luminous sources in the chandra only sample : only one rq sources ( h 1821 + 643 ) shows l@xmath27 above 10@xmath28 erg s@xmath9 , thus the correlation index is extremely sensitive to its ew measurement : for h 1821 + 643 we fixed the line width at 1000 km s@xmath9 to get an ew of 40 ev ; while the best fit value gives a line width of 10000 km s@xmath9 and an ew of 140 ev ; adopting the later values we get a linear correlation index of @xmath29 .",
    "we can clearly see that when the rl sources were excluded from the sample the correlation between the line line ew and x - ray luminosity became much weaker ( with a confidence level less than 2@xmath30 ) . to show the results more clearly ,",
    "in figure 5 we plot the mean ew for 5 luminosity bins for all agns and just the radio - quiet objects in the combined sample .",
    "following page et al .",
    "( 2004a ) , the upper limits were taken to be half of the value , together with an equally sized error bar .",
    "similar to page et al .",
    ", we find a clear anti - correlation for rq+rl sources ( figure 5a ) .",
    "however , for rq only sources , we see no anti - correlation in figure 5b .",
    "suggestions for the origin of the neutral fe k@xmath0 line include the putative molecular torus and/or the blr ( broad - line region ) .",
    "since produced at a much larger scale , the line should exhibit no significant fluctuations within a timescale of months to years , while the behavior of the x - ray continuum is much more active within much shorter timescales ( krolik et al .",
    "1993 ) . as a result",
    ", the observed equivalent width of the narrow line would be surely smaller while the x - ray continuum in a higher state , and vise versa .",
    "for instance , figure 6 plots the observations of and with _ chandra _ ( the only two radio quiet sources with more than two _ chandra _ hetg observations ) and the best - fit lines .",
    "although there are only 6 points for ngc 3783 and 3 points for ngc 4151 , we performed a linear regression to give the best - fit slopes of them ( @xmath31 , rs = @xmath32 for ngc 3783 and @xmath33 , rs = @xmath34 for ngc 4151 )",
    ". as expected , its ew clearly decreases with increasing luminosity .",
    "such an effect may naturally lead to the observed anti - correlation slope between the ew and luminosity for a sample of agn . in this section",
    "we run monte - carlo simulations to check this possibility .",
    "an anti - correlation between the x - ray luminosity and long term variation amplitude in seyfert 1 galaxies was described by markovitz & edelson ( 2004 ) .",
    "fractional variability amplitudes ( @xmath35 ) were measured for each light curve to quantify the intrinsic variability amplitude .",
    "@xmath36 where @xmath37 is the total variance of the light curve , @xmath38 is the mean error squared and @xmath39 is the mean count rate of @xmath40 total points .",
    "they gave the anti - correlation between fractional variability amplitude and luminosity : @xmath41 for long ( 1296 days ) timescale data .",
    "here we adopt a toy model to simulate the x - ray continuum variation , while line flux is assumed to be invariable .",
    "the observed x - ray luminosity is assumed to be normally distributed with the width of the gaussian distribution calculated to match the observed excess variance at different luminosities ( markovitz & edelson 2004 ) . by normalizing the observed line ew for the combined rq sample ( with upper limits ) to the best - fit line , we first construct a set of line ew which does not correlate with the x - ray luminosity .",
    "random continuum variations are then added to the luminosities , and the line ew are modified correspondingly since we assume no change to the line flux .",
    "we repeated this step to build 1000 artificial samples with different random seed for each time .",
    "we used asurv to perform linear regression to the artificial samples .",
    "the distribution of the best - fit power - law slopes of the artificial samples was presented in figure 7 .",
    "we can see that 8.4% of the simulations produce anti - correlation slopes steeper than the observed value , and the mean value is @xmath42 , which is compatible with the observed value ( @xmath25 ) within the errors .",
    "in this paper , we studied the narrow iron k@xmath0 line in 123 seyfert 1 galaxies and qsos with archive _ chandra _ hetgs observations and _ xmm _ observations in literature .",
    "there is an anti - correlation between the ew of the narrow , neutral iron line observed and the x - ray continuum luminosity : as the 2 - 10 kev rest frame luminosity increases , the equivalent width of the line drops .",
    "one possible reason for this negative correlation is a decline in the covering factor of the putative molecular torus as the luminosity increases ( page et al .",
    "however , because of the dilution effect of relativistic beaming in the radio loud sources , they should be excluded from the study . although page et al . also reported an x - ray baldwin effect after excluding rl agn from their sample , the effect appears to be much weaker for rq agn in our larger sample .",
    "we find that the observed weak anti - correlation can be explained by the observational bias cause by variable agn x - ray continuum .",
