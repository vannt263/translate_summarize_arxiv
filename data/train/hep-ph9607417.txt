    "the dynamics of the electroweak phase transition has received much attention in recent years @xcite .",
    "the main reason for this interest is that , within the context of big - bang cosmology , the standard electroweak model can , in principle , satisfy the three conditions obtained by sakharov for the generation of the observed baryon asymmetry in the universe @xcite : ( a ) baryon number violation ; ( b ) cp violation , and ; ( c ) nonequilibrium dynamics . to date , most mechanisms invoked to satisfy the third condition make use of a first order phase transition . [ for mechanisms based on cosmic strings see ref .",
    "] this is also true for extensions of the standard model , which are currently favored by most authors , due to difficulties in generating sufficient baryon number within the minimal standard model @xcite .",
    "based on estimates of the quantum - corrected effective potential , nonequilibrium conditions are generated by the motion of critical bubbles of the broken ( true ) phase , which are nucleated within the symmetric phase . for the several baryogenesis models which rely on extensions of the standard model , the parameter space is large enough to justify the assumption of a fairly strong first order transition .",
    "however , analyses based on the 1-loop finite temperature effective potential for the minimal standard model@xcite and its improved versions , show that the phase transition is very weak , within the current lower bounds for the higgs mass , @xmath0 @xcite , or even of second order for larger higgs masses , @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the weakness of the transition is further supported by nonperturbative lattice computations @xcite .",
    "our interest in the present paper is to further investigate @xcite the possible consequences of having a weak first order phase transition at the electroweak scale .",
    "although we will restrict our analysis to the standard electroweak model , our results can be adapted to any of its extensions .",
    "in fact , we will show that the strength of the transition can be used as a new constraint on the parameters of the model , always a welcome addition to the often large parameter space of extensions to the minimal standard model .",
    "the interest in exploiting the dynamics of weak first order transitions goes beyond its potential relevance for baryogenesis .",
    "as recent results have shown , a sufficiently weak first order transition will exhibit a different dynamics from the usual homogeneous nucleation results @xcite ; the extra free energy available in large amplitude fluctuations which are _ not _ included in the gaussian computation for the nucleation rate will act to decrease the decay barrier , suppressing supercooling , and speeding up the completion of the phase transition .",
    "for even weaker transitions , critical bubble nucleation may be completely absent .",
    "clearly , the information from the effective potential is not sufficient to determine the details of the transition ; mean - field theory breaks down in the presence of large infrared corrections .    in order to quantify the above statements",
    ", we will make use of the subcritical bubbles method @xcite .",
    "that is , we will model large amplitude thermal fluctuations by gaussian - shaped bubbles of approximately correlation volume .",
    "previous results based on a kinetic approach , have indicated that such fluctuations can destroy the first - order character of the transition for higgs masses of order @xmath2 gev @xcite .",
    "here we would like to complement this calculation by computing in detail the nucleation rate for such configurations , which was previously assumed for simplicity to be @xmath3 $ ] , where @xmath4 is a constant of order unity , @xmath5 is the curvature of the potential in the symmetric phase , and @xmath6 is the free energy of the gaussian configuration . note that this is a nontrivial exercise , as these configurations are not solutions to the euclidean equations of motion . within reasonable approximations",
    ", we will be able to obtain the equilibrium number density of these configurations as a function of the tree - level higgs mass , to show how the weakness of the transition is closely related to the breakdown of the dilute gas approximation .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we give a brief review of subcritical bubbles in the context of the electroweak standard model . in sec .",
    "iii , we compute the equilibrium number density of subcritical fluctuations and discuss the choice of parameters in the subcritical bubble configuration",
    ". there we also discuss the validity of the approximations taken and the range of applicability of our results . in sec .",
    "iv , we discuss how the weakness of the electroweak phase transition is related to the breakdown of the dilute gas approximation ; for large enough higgs masses , subcritical bubbles percolate , completing the transition . in sec .",

    "a statistical mechanical method is used for studying the importance of phase mixing in the phase transition , where the volume fraction occupied by fluctuations is determined by summing over all possible fluctuations of different sizes and amplitudes . in the next section , by computing this volume fraction within our approximations , we will be able to compare our results with the ones obtained in the statistical mechanics method .    with @xmath182 and @xmath183",
    ", we can immediately evaluate ( [ deltaz ] ) and have an estimative of the leading wave function contribution . in figure 1",
    "we have given @xmath184 as a function of the higgs mass , with @xmath184 computed at the critical temperature @xmath41 .",
    "our result for the fraction given by ( [ deltaz ] ) is much like the same one as given in @xcite , where @xmath185 for @xmath186 .",
    "however , for such larger higgs masses it is well known that the perturbative expansion breaks down and the effective potential becomes unreliable @xcite . for the interval of higgs masses",
    "we will be interested in , the wave function correction is small and , if higher order corrections are taken into account and plasma masses are included in @xmath187 , we expect the wave function contributions be even smaller , as shown in @xcite .",
    "studies of the electroweak phase transition , through the analyses of the effective potential @xcite and direct numerical simulations @xcite , indicate that the nature of the electroweak phase transition is most possible of first order , but it has a excitation barrier to small , qualifying the phase transition as very weakly first order . in these situations it has been argued that the dynamics of the phase transition could be quite different from the usual process of critical bubble nucleation .",
    "in fact , due the weak nature of the phase transition , ( subcritical ) fluctuations over the barrier can become the main mechanism by which the phase transition can complete . here , we analyze the importance of a possible large amount of phase mixing at temperatures higher than the nucleation temperature of critical bubbles . in this sense",
    ", we argue that if the volume of true vacuum phase fluctuations becomes higher than a certain value , percolation of the fluctuations can occur .",
    "we thus have a possible scenario where the phase transition can be completed just by those over the barrier subcritical fluctuations .    a well known result of statistical mechanics of dynamics of cluster systems @xcite",
    "show that there is a critical probability value @xmath188 , with the cluster probability defined by    @xmath189    where , in three space dimensions , this critical percolation probability is roughly @xmath190 @xcite and beyond which clusters are favored to coalesce and grow , filling the whole volume of the system .    from our definition of the volume occupied by the field configurations @xmath85 , at a fixed temperature @xmath169 , eq .",
    "( [ vsc ] ) , it is quite natural to define , therefore , a percolation temperature @xmath191 as given by    @xmath192    from eq .",
    "( [ vsc ] ) , we obtain    @xmath193    condition ( [ vperc2 ] ) gives us the temperature ( as a function of the higgs mass ) below which subcritical fluctuations become favorable to coalesce and grow , forming large regions of the true vacuum phase .",
    "if @xmath191 is larger than the nucleation temperature @xmath194 , that marks the onset of critical bubbles nucleation , then we have an effective mechanism by which the phase transition can complete , as explained above , only due the dynamics of subcritical fluctuations of the stable phase @xmath179 , inside the false vacuum phase .",
    "note that at @xmath191 , condition ( [ vperc ] ) , due to ( [ val2 ] ) , will also signal the breakdown of the dilute gas approximation .",
    "thus , for temperatures too close to @xmath191 , the obtained expression for @xmath167 , eq .",
    "( [ nsc ] ) , would just give a qualitative indication of the importance of subcritical fluctuations during the phase transition .",
    "we must , however , comment on the alternative method of the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite , where a statistical mechanical approach is used for studying the dynamics of subcritical bubbles , modeled there as in eq . ( [ sub ] ) . by constructing a kinetic equation for the ( dynamical ) number density of fluctuations",
    ", they could obtain an analytical expression for @xmath195 , within appropriate approximations .",
    "their kinetic approach also break down for @xmath195 close to the critical percolation probability , where fluctuations become more dense and the treatment of the coalescence of fluctuations becomes important . besides the different approach , the method applied to the electroweak phase transition ( see gleiser s talk in @xcite ) show that @xmath196 changes sharply for @xmath197 , just as the result obtained here for @xmath195 shows ( figure 2 ) . also , recent numerical simulations of very weak first order phase transitions @xcite give support to our results .",
    "all these dynamical studies indicate the validity of the various approximations here adopted in order to make possible to arrive to an analytical expression for @xmath167 .    in our analyses",
    "it is enough to study the ratio @xmath195 at the critical temperature @xmath41 , for which we get the plot shown in figure 2 , in terms of the higgs mass @xmath198 , where we have used the approximation for @xmath30 ,    @xmath199    from figure 2 we see that for a higgs mass of @xmath200 , our results indicate that phase mixing is so large that the volume of subcritical fluctuations in the broken phase start becoming relevant for the dynamics of the phase transition .",
    "however , due to the condition of validity of the dilute gas approximation used in our evaluation , eq .",
    "( [ val2 ] ) , our results can only be interpreted qualitatively for @xmath197 .",
    "besides these limitations , the results obtained here are in accordance to recent results based on dynamical studies of very weak phase transitions , as discussed above .",
    "the main result of this paper is the computation of the equilibrium density for the field configuration @xmath85 , with the full evaluation of the preexponential term @xmath161 given by ( [ a ] ) and the effective free energy @xmath201 , eq .",
    "( [ df ] ) .",
    "previous results have given @xmath167 just in terms of a boltzman distribution form , with free energy given by ( [ f(t ) ] ) and prefactor given by just @xmath202 . from ( [ zab ] ) and ( [ nsc ] )",
    "we see that the preexponential factors differ by the factor @xmath161 , which we show in figure 3 , as a function of the higgs mass , which shows that the prefactor can assume large values for small values of the higgs mass . in figure 4",
    ", we also compare the exponential factor @xmath165 with @xmath49 , both compute at @xmath203 .",
    "we have explicitly evaluated the equilibrium density of subcritical fluctuations and shown that the same can differ substantially from the usual expression .",
    "we have also analyzed the relative importance of subcritical fluctuations during the electroweak phase transition , showing that the mechanism for completion of the phase transition can be quite different from the usual critical bubble nucleation in a first order phase transition . for values of the higgs mass at and higher than the experimental lower bound of @xmath200 ,",
    "our results show that substantial phase mixing can be present prior to critical bubble nucleation , changing the dynamics of the phase transition .",
    "our results for the number density and volume occupied by those subcritical fluctuations can be interpreted as an average value at some fixed temperature , since we expect that in some large volume @xmath204 ( @xmath205 ) we have both processes of nucleation of subcritical bubbles and their shrinking , keeping their average density , at that temperature , constant in that large volume .",
    "we must also remember that the results obtained here are in accordance with other studies involving the relevance of thermal fluctuations during the electroweak phase transition @xcite and recent studies of the dynamics of very weak first order phase transitions , both by numerical simulations as by a statistical mechanics approach for the dynamics of fluctuations modeled by @xmath85 , eq .",
