    "much of the recent excitement in string theory stems from a conjecture about the essential degrees of freedom underlying @xmath5-theory ; namely , eleven dimensional @xmath5-theory is given by a u(@xmath2 ) gauge invariant supersymmetric matrix model , which is formally obtained by reducing @xmath6 dimensional super yang - mills to @xmath7 dimensions via classical dimensional reduction @xcite .",
    "motivated by the work of witten @xcite , we may interpret the eigenvalues of the ( hermitian matrix - valued ) yang - mills fields as space - time coordinates of d - particles , where the world line trajectories are given by the @xmath7 dimensional matrix model lagrangian .",
    "deviations from classical space - time are therefore seen from the non - commutative properties of these matrix coordinates .",
    "of course , until the correspondence between @xmath5-theory and the matrix model is rigorously established , we have to content ourselves with the label `` matrix theory '' for the matrix model , in order to distinguish it ( and its consequences ) from the formal definition of @xmath5-theory @xcite .    now the underlying yang - mills theory of the matrix model is manifestly ten dimensional , and so in order to establish any connection with ( eleven dimensional ) @xmath5-theory , a necessary ( and highly non - trivial ) ingredient in the conjecture is the assertion that the large @xmath2 limit of the matrix model effectively gives rise to an additional space - like dimension .",
    "the resulting theory is then interpreted as @xmath5-theory in the light - cone frame .",
    "an attempt to strengthen the plausibility of this assumption by associating the integer @xmath2 with the harmonic resolution @xmath3 of discretized light - cone quantization ( dlcq)@xcite has recently been made by susskind@xcite .    evidently , these developments suggest that another ( closer ) look at yang - mills theory in the large @xmath2 limit is in order if we wish to understand its true underlying dynamics , and , ironically , obtain possible insights into a new kind of ` string ' theory .",
    "the crucial issue here is the ( conjectured ) existence of a _",
    "double scaling limit _ involving the integer @xmath2 , which we send to infinity , and an additional parameter  such as a lattice spacing , @xmath8  which must eventually be sent to zero @xcite .",
    "simply put : whether one takes these limits independently or not determines whether one ends up with conventional yang - mills , or not .",
    "the result is that we have an extra free parameter , in addition to the usual coupling constant , and so we are forced to generalize our usual concept of yang - mills theory .",
    "moreover , this new parameter can be shown to be related to the string coupling constant of type iia or type iib string theory @xcite .",
    "conventional yang - mills is then recovered when this extra parameter is set to zero",
    ".    in summary , developments in non - perturbative string theory have shed new light on the interpretation of large @xmath2 yang - mills theory , giving rise to ` generalized yang - mills'@xcite .",
    "we will discuss in this article how dlcq enables one to clarify these ideas in a quantitative manner .",
    "figure [ pentagon ] outlines how a notion of generalized yang - mills may be viewed as emerging from string theory related investigations ; the arrows are labeled by key concepts involved in the progress from one development to the next , starting with ordinary yang - mills , and moving anti - clockwise around the figure ( the broken arrow relating formal @xmath5-theory to matrix theory reflects the conjectured equivalence between the two ) .",
    "the connection between ordinary and generalized yang - mills via dlcq is also implied , and will be the subject of this paper .",
    "our main goal therefore is to outline a framework which ( we believe ) naturally incorporates string dynamics and conventional yang - mills in a unified setting .",
    "the contents of this paper are organized as follows ; in section [ yang ] we consider the two dimensional super yang - mills theory which is a candidate for non - perturbative type iia string theory @xcite .",
    "we formulate the theory using light - cone coordinates for the string world sheet , and quantize the theory in the light - cone gauge . in section [ dlcq ]",
    ", we discuss discretized light - cone quantization .",
    "this discretization procedure admits a natural formulation of ` bit strings ' , which will represent our string states , and which can be shown to end on d - particle - like configurations . this is the subject matter of section [ branes ] .",
    "subtleties associated with the large @xmath2 limit , and the implications of an additional dimensionless parameter in yang - mills due to a double scaling limit will be addressed in section [ doublescaling ] .",
    "we conclude with a comment on possible future directions in section [ end ] .",
    "by definition , compactifying eleven dimensional @xmath5-theory on a circle @xmath9 gives type iia string theory - theory is just the strong coupling limit of ten dimensional type iia string theory . ] .",
    "this suggests how one may obtain a possible representation of non - perturbative type iia string theory via matrix theory ; namely , we compactify one of the spatial dimensions of the matrix model on a circle @xmath9 @xcite . the theory we end up with is called matrix string theory , although there is now considerable evidence that it exhibits the known properties of type iia string theory @xcite .",
    "actually , it turns out that matrix string theory may be formally obtained by dimensionally reducing @xmath6 dimensional @xmath10 super yang - mills to @xmath0 dimensions . for the sake of completeness ,",
    "we review the underlying ten dimensional light - cone yang - mills theory in appendix [ ymills10 ]  in perhaps more detail than is customary  although the ideas should be familiar to many readers .    in order to dimensionally reduce the ten dimensional yang - mills action ( [ lcversion ] ) ( see appendix [ ymills10 ] ) to a @xmath0 dimensional field theory",

    "of course , the @xmath32 s are non - commuting in general , and so we can not simultaneously diagonalize them to obtain a classical description of a propagating string .",
    "it is in this sense that matrix ( string ) theory forces us to revise our notion of space - time as an approximately derived concept , and deviations from the classical formulation may be measured in terms of the non - commuting properties of these matrix coordinates .",
    "since we are working in the light - cone frame , it is natural to adopt the light - cone gauge @xmath33 . with this gauge choice",

    "the `` charge - neutrality '' condition ( first integral constraint from ( [ eq4 ] ) ) requires that all the colour indices must be contracted for physical states .",

    "a single trace of these creation operators may be identified as a single closed string , where each operator ( or ` parton ' ) , carrying some longitudinal momentum @xmath60 , represents a ` bit ' of the string .",
    "a product of traced operators is then a multiple string state .",

    "these disks are the ` string bits ' which each carry some fraction of the total light - cone momentum @xmath41 .",
    "states which are dominated by an infinite number of such partons are evidently candidates for our string states .",
    "we will elaborate on this remark in section [ branes ] .",
    "states involving multiple closed string states correspond in this formalism to a product of two or more traces in the fock space representation . a fock state with two closed strings ,",
    "for example , would have the general form @xmath69 \\cdot   \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n^s } } \\mbox{tr } [   \\gamma_{\\beta_1}^{\\dagger}({\\tilde k}_1^+ ) \\cdots   \\gamma_{\\beta_s}^{\\dagger}({\\tilde k}_s^+ ) ] \\vert 0 \\rangle,\\ ] ] where @xmath70 .",
    "finally , it should be stressed that the space of states generated by the single closed string states ( i.e. all states which may be written as in ( [ fockexp1 ] ) ) forms an invariant subspace of the light - cone hamiltonian in the large @xmath2 limit .",
    "the reasoning here is that the splitting or joining interactions ( see , for example , figure [ pic3 ] ) involving multiple string states is suppressed by a factor @xmath71 , which represents ( in this scenario ) the string coupling constant .",
    "this is the conventional interpretation of large @xmath2 yang - mills : all non - planar diagrams are suppressed .",
    "however , we shall discuss in section [ doublescaling ] how a double scaling limit involving @xmath2 , and an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath3 , enables one to have an effectively non - zero string coupling even in the large @xmath2 limit .",
    "but first we need to introduce the concept of discretized light - cone quantization in order to define the integer @xmath3 .",
    "if we substitute the mode expansions ( [ xexp ] ) and ( [ uexp ] ) for the bosonic and fermion fields into expressions ( [ p+ ] ) and ( [ p- ] ) , we may explicitly derive the quantized light - cone momentum and hamiltonian operators @xmath72 in terms of the ( momentum dependent ) creation and annihilation operators @xmath73 , ( bosons ) and @xmath74 ( fermions)@xcite .",
    "one may then extract boundstates and masses by solving the eigen - equation @xmath75 where @xmath76 is some appropriate superposition of single and multiple closed string fock states .",
    "one can show that @xmath41 commutes with the hamiltonian @xmath42 ( i.e. it is conserved in all interactions ) , and is already diagonal on the space of closed string fock states .",
    "the problem , therefore , is to diagonalize the light - cone hamiltonian @xmath42 with respect to the given fock basis .",
    "if we substitute the most general closed string expansion ( involving single and multiple strings ) for @xmath76 into the eigen - equation ( [ mass - shell ] ) , we obtain an infinitely - coupled set of integral equations relating wavefunctions from different fock sectors . finding analytical solutions to these integral equations",
    "is in general a formidable task , and it is here that the dlcq method has proven to be extremely useful in extracting numerical solutions . in the context of supersymmetric field theories ,",
    "additional simplifications can be made by noting that in certain cases we may write @xmath77 in terms of the light - cone supercharges @xmath78 , and so the eigen - problem in this case is reduced to diagonalizing ( via dlcq ) the square root @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "application of this technique to calculate boundstates in matrix string theory is the subject of current investigation@xcite .",
    "let us now briefly review the dlcq method in the context of matrix string theory ( for a more detailed treatment , see @xcite ) .",
    "the essential idea is surprisingly simple : we discretize the light - cone momenta of constituent partons , or string bits , keeping in mind that the total light - cone momentum @xmath41 is always conserved . in practice , this means we introduce an ( ideally large ) positive integer @xmath3 such that @xmath80 defines the smallest unit of momentum .",
    "the light - cone momentum @xmath60 of any constituent parton is then some positive integer multiple of this smallest unit : @xmath81 of course , we recover the continuum formulation in the limit @xmath82 . note",
    "that for a fock state with @xmath83 partons , with each parton carrying momentum @xmath84 , this prescription gives @xmath85 where the integers @xmath86 lie in the range @xmath87 , and satisfy the constraint @xmath88 evidently , if @xmath3 is fixed and finite , then ( [ cond2 ] ) is satisfied in only a finite number of ways , and so the space of fock states is also finitely enumerated . in this case , the hamiltonian is just a finite matrix , which , in principle , can always be diagonalized by some numerical routine .",
    "all of this depends on the crucial assumption that one may neglect the `` zero modes '' ; i.e. @xmath89 . in the continuum formulation ,",
    "we may certainly assume @xmath55 , since the point @xmath57 is a zero measure set , and can not affect the evaluation of an integral .",
    "however , this is no longer the case in the discretized theory @xcite .",
    "the crucial issue here is that for finite @xmath3 , integrals over light - cone momenta are replaced by finite sums , and so if there are any contributions arising from integrations around singularities at @xmath90 in the continuum theory , then they can only appear in the discretized version of the same theory via the zero mode @xmath57 .",
    "even so , such zero modes may at best only provide a ` mean field ' picture of the true dynamics at vanishingly small @xmath60 ( since @xmath3 is finite ) and so we are not guaranteed of a faithful representation of the theory even after we introduce these zero mode degrees of freedom .",
    "one way to avoid the issue of zero modes in the dlcq formulation of matrix string theory is to always assume the continuum limit @xmath82 in all expressions involving @xmath3 .",
    "the quantity @xmath4 is then to be interpreted as vanishingly small , and so can not represent some finite cutoff in the theory . rather , any singularities that arise at vanishing @xmath60 are to be taken care of by introducing a set of cancelation conditions as in @xcite .    admittedly , this formal approach is not always useful , since in most practical implementations of dlcq one works with finite values of @xmath3 , and the continuum limit @xmath82 is obtained by performing a suitable extrapolation .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that neglecting the zero mode in the discretized version of a number of two dimensional theories does not affect the spectrum of massive boundstates , and so , in this case , the strategy of working with finite values of @xmath3 , and then extrapolating to the continuum limit @xmath82 proves to be a remarkably effective way of numerically extracting boundstates and mass spectra .",
    "perhaps the best candidates for such special theories are two dimensional supersymmetric models with unbroken supersymmetry .",
    "matrix string theory is therefore expected to admit a numerical boundstate analysis via the dlcq method with finite @xmath3 .",
    "consider a fock state representing a single closed string of @xmath83 partons with total light - cone momentum @xmath91 : @xmath69 \\vert   0 \\rangle \\label{fsw}\\ ] ] where @xmath92 is a creation operator for a fermion or boson carrying light - cone momentum @xmath84 .",
    "if we perform dlcq , then the light - cone momenta must be integer multiples of the smallest unit of momentum , @xmath80 , and may be identified with the @xmath83 integers @xmath93 .",
    "these integers need only satisfy the constraints @xmath94 for given ( finite ) values of @xmath3 , enumerating all such integer sets @xmath95 satisfying the above constraints is , in principle , accomplished by a suitable computer algorithm , although the processing time would increase at least exponentially as @xmath3 is increased . what will be of interest to us are the general physical properties that may be ascribed to such integer solution sets in the continuum limit @xmath82 .",
    "the first case we consider is when the total number of string bits , @xmath83 , is finite . since @xmath82",
    ", we must have at least one of the integers in the constraint ( [ sumk ] ) tend to infinity as well .",
    "we will call the corresponding partons in this case `` d - partons '' ; all remaining partons will be called `` wee - partons '' : @xmath96 of course , this is just a formal way of saying that d - partons each have ( positive ) non - zero light - cone momentum , while the momentum carried by each wee - parton is vanishingly small .",
    "pictorially ( see figure [ pic4 ] ) , we will distinguish a d - parton from a wee - parton by size .",
    "now consider what happens if we allow the total number of partons , @xmath83 , tend to infinity .",
    "it is now possible to have an infinite number of wee - partons , even though as a whole they may carry only a finite fraction of the total light - cone momentum @xmath41 .",
    "for example , let us consider the fock state ( [ fsw ] ) where each parton carries the smallest possible unit of momentum ( @xmath80 ) . in this case ,",
    "@xmath97 for all @xmath98 , and constraint ( [ sumk ] ) implies that the total number of such partons is @xmath3 ( i.e. @xmath99 ) .",
    "as we let @xmath82 , we end up with a _ closed string _ consisting of an infinite number of wee - partons ( figure [ pic5](a ) ) .",
    "now let us consider a state with a single d - parton .",
    "this may be accomplished by making the assignments @xmath100 where @xmath3 is an even integer here , and @xmath101 .",
    "the total number of wee - partons is thus @xmath102 , which tends to infinity in the @xmath82 limit .",
    "half of the total light - cone momentum is carried by this string of wee - partons , while the single d - parton carries the remaining half .",
    "this state resembles an _",
    "open string _ of wee - partons with both ends fixed to the same d - parton ( figure [ pic5](b ) ) .    for an example of an open string of wee - partons ending on different d - partons ( figure [ pic5](c ) )",
    ", we make the assignments @xmath103 where @xmath104 , and @xmath3 is divisible by four . in the continuum limit @xmath82",
    ", we have two adjacent d - partons carrying half the total light - cone momentum , while the `` long string '' of wee - partons ( there being an infinite number of them ) carries the other half .",
    "we will use the phrase `` short string '' of wee - partons if there are only a finite number of them .    as a final example",
    ", we may construct two open strings of wee - partons ending on two d - partons ( figure [ pic5](d ) ) by making the assignments @xmath105 where @xmath104 and @xmath3 is divisible by four . in this case , the two d - partons are separated by long strings of wee - partons , and collectively share half of the total light - cone momentum .",
    "evidently , these examples only provide a glimpse at the the totality of all possible configurations , and whether a particular configuration dominates in a low energy boundstate or not depends on the dynamical properties of the light - cone hamiltonian .",
    "actually , in a recent study of qcd coupled to adjoint fermions , low energy boundstates made from only wee partons were found to exist@xcite . in any case , one can see from these simple observations that the existence of such `` long strings '' of wee - partons , along with the d - partons , naturally incorporates the dynamics of open and closed strings , together with d - particle - like objects on which these open strings may end .",
    "however , the theory we have constructed may exhibit structures which do not admit an obvious classification from such string and/or d - particle - like configurations , and more detailed studies of the hamiltonian will be required if we wish to investigate the structure of the low energy boundstates in the theory .",
    "in a fully interacting string theory , one has `` splitting '' and `` joining '' interactions which can change the number of strings . in the present context , if we take the large @xmath2 limit while keeping @xmath106 fixed , has the dimension of mass squared , which acts as the string tension . ] then by keeping track of normalizations one can easily show that such interactions are suppressed by a factor @xmath71 ( figure [ pic3 ] ) .",
    "however , in the dlcq formulation , we have an additional parameter @xmath3 , which is also sent to infinity to recover the continuum , and so there is now a possibility of double scaling between these two diverging integers . in particular",
    ", we would like to know whether one can still have an effectively non - zero string coupling constant even in the limit @xmath107 .    to investigate these ideas further",
    ", we begin by considering the mass term operator in any massive two dimensional bosonic matrix field theory ( on the light - cone ) : @xmath108 such an operator acts on the closed string of @xmath83 partons @xmath109 \\vert 0 \\rangle$ ] as follows : @xmath110 where @xmath111 . in the dlcq formulation , the last identity becomes @xmath112 where the integers @xmath113 are related to the original light - cone momenta @xmath84 in the usual way : @xmath114 , and @xmath115 . if @xmath116 consists only of d - partons ( i.e. if @xmath117 is non - zero in the continuum limit @xmath82 ) then @xmath118 , and therefore the mass operator is simply multiplication by a finite constant which is indepnedent of @xmath3 : @xmath119 as @xmath82",
    "now consider the case where @xmath120 for some finite number of partons .",
    "i.e. we have a finite number of wee - partons . in this case , @xmath121 as @xmath82 , and we therefore have a different scaling behaviour for the mass operator .    finally , if we set all the integers @xmath86 to unity , so that we end up with a closed string of ( only ) wee - partons , then @xmath122 as @xmath82 , and we thus arrive at another scaling behaviour for the mass operator when the number of wee - partons is allowed to grow to infinity .    in summary",
    ", we have observed in a simple case that operators may scale differently with respect to @xmath3 depending on the fock state configuration , and in particular , long strings of wee - partons give rise to the largest scaling exponent for @xmath3 .    for matrix string theory ( which has no explicit mass terms ) , the scaling behaviour is perhaps not immediately calculable without solving the full hamiltonian  a task which is under current investigation @xcite  and",
    "so at this stage our presentation will have to be schematic . at any rate , we know the theory is supersymmetric , and so , schematically , we may write @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is a light - cone supercharge operator ( in fact , there are eight such operators in all  see appendix [ lcsuper ] ) .",
    "the supercharge @xmath124 contains only cubic interactions , and in the dlcq formulation has the ( very ) schematic representation @xmath125 where the operators @xmath126 annihilate and create partons in a closed string of partons .",
    "note that @xmath106 is held fixed as we take the large @xmath2 limit .",
    "splitting interactions  such as the one illustrated in figure [ pic3 ]  are generated by the terms @xmath127 , and introduce an overall factor of @xmath128 , so the amplitude for a single splitting interaction is roughly @xmath129 for a d - parton , the integer @xmath130 ( corresponding to the light - cone momentum @xmath131 ) must scale like @xmath132 , and so the amplitude ( [ amp ] ) is @xmath71 , which vanishes in the large @xmath2 limit .",
    "this suggests that fock states of d - partons do not give rise to interacting string dynamics in the large @xmath2 limit .",
    "this is the usual interpretation of large @xmath2 yang - mills : all non - planar diagrams are suppressed  which , in this case , is equivalent to restricting to the fock space of _ single _ closed loops of partons .",
    "now consider a long closed string of wee - partons . to make things simple ,",
    "assume each parton has the smallest possible light - cone momentum , @xmath80 , so that we have a closed string of @xmath3 wee - partons .",
    "the integer @xmath130 appearing in ( [ amp ] ) is now equal to unity , and the splitting amplitude is now @xmath133 .",
    "if all the wee - partons are identical , there may be an additional factor of @xmath3 which arises from cyclic symmetry , but for now we restrict ourselves to the more general case .",
    "it is now clear that with the amplitude @xmath133 one has the possibility of taking a double scaling limit ; i.e. we let @xmath107 and @xmath82 while keeping the ratio @xmath134 fixed .",
    "although the analysis here is very naive , it is nevertheless intriguing that @xmath3 must scale in proportion to @xmath2 if we wish to incorporate interacting string dynamics .",
    "it is of course well established that the limit @xmath82 in dlcq effects a decompactification of a ( light - cone ) space dimension , and so identifying @xmath3 with @xmath2 in the present context suggests that the large @xmath2 limit is indeed associated with a decompactification of an additional space - like dimension .",
    "related ideas have been proposed in a recent work by susskind @xcite .    at any rate , the resulting theory can no longer be identified with conventional yang - mills , since we have an additional parameter specified by the ratio @xmath133 , which acts as an effective string coupling .",
    "of course , for small values of this ratio , we recover conventional large @xmath2 yang - mills weakly coupled to a string - like theory .",
    "our investigations have shown that there is scope for quantitative investigations of field theories that are generalizations of conventional large @xmath2 yang - mills theory . in particular , we suggest that discretized light - cone quantization offers a promising approach to unify in a natural framework open and closed string dynamics coupled to conventional large @xmath2 yang - mills theory .    a key ingredient in this proposal is the identification of a double scaling limit involving the u(@xmath2 ) gauge group parameter @xmath2 , and the dlcq harmonic resolution @xmath3 , which are both sent to infinity .",
    "we provided a crude argument as to why the ratio @xmath133 must be constant for an interacting string theory , and how such a ratio is related to the effective string coupling constant .",
    "this observation appears to be consistent with the recent suggestion that matrix theory for finite @xmath2 corresponds to the dlcq of @xmath5-theory , with harmonic resolution @xmath135 .    in any case , it is clear that further numerical studies of two ( and possibly higher ) dimensional yang - mills theories in the large @xmath2 limit would help clarify the physical consequences that follow from taking this limit . as we have seen",
    ", the emergence of an additional parameter via a double scaling limit , and the proposed connection with conventional string theory , suggests ( rather ironically ) that we are perhaps understanding the full implications of yang - mills theory for the first time .",
    "* acknowledgments *    the authors would like to thank s.pinsky and a.curtis for many stimulating discussions .",
    "let s start with @xmath10 super yang - mills theory in 9 + 1 dimensions with gauge group u(@xmath2 ) , where @xmath136 in the instanton contribution : @xmath137 where @xmath138 , \\\\ d_{\\mu}\\psi & = & \\partial_{\\mu}\\psi+{\\rm i}g[a_\\mu , \\psi ] ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath139 .",
    "the majorana spinor @xmath140 transforms in the adjoint representation of u(@xmath2 ) .",
    "the ( flat ) space - time metric @xmath141 has signature @xmath142 , and we adopt the normalization @xmath143 for the generators of the u(@xmath2 ) gauge group .    in order to realize the ten dimensional dirac algebra @xmath144 in terms of majorana matrices , we use as building blocks the reducible @xmath145 representation of the spin(8 ) clifford algebra . in block form",
    ", we have @xmath146 where the @xmath147 real matrices , @xmath148 , satisfy @xmath149 .",
    "this automatically ensures the spin(8 ) algebra @xmath150 for the @xmath29 real - symmetric matrices @xmath30 . an explicit representation for the @xmath148 algebra",
    "may be given in terms of a tensor product of pauli matrices @xcite . in the present context",
    ", we may choose a representation such that a ninth matrix , @xmath151 , which anti - commutes with the other eight @xmath30 s , takes the explicit form @xmath152 we may now construct @xmath153 pure imaginary ( or majorana ) matrices @xmath154 which realize the dirac algebra for the lorentz group so(@xmath155 ) : @xmath156 the majorana spinor therefore has 32 real components , and since it transforms in the adjoint representation of u(@xmath2 ) , each of these components may be viewed as an @xmath22 hermitian matrix .",
    "an additional matrix @xmath157 , which is equal to @xmath158 in the representation specified by ( [ gamma9 ] ) , is easily seen to anti - commute with all other gamma matrices , and satisfies @xmath159 . it is also real , and so the majorana spinor field @xmath140 admits a chiral decomposition via the projection operators @xmath160 : @xmath161 we will therefore consider only spinors with positive chirality @xmath162 ( majorana - weyl ) : @xmath163 where @xmath164 is a sixteen component real spinor , and the numerical factor @xmath165 is introduced for later convenience .",
    "since @xmath166 anti - commutes with the other eight @xmath30 s , and satisfies @xmath167 , we may construct further projection operators @xmath168 and @xmath169 which project out , respectively , the right - moving and left - moving components of the sixteen component spinor @xmath164 defined in ( [ spin16 ] ) : @xmath170 this decomposition is particularly useful when working with light - cone coordinates , since in the light - cone gauge one can express the left - moving component @xmath171 in terms of the right - moving component @xmath172 by virtue of the fermion constraint equation .",
    "we will derive this result shortly . in terms of the usual ten dimensional minkowski space - time coordinates ,",
    "the light - cone coordinates are given by @xmath173 note that the ` raising ' and ` lowering ' of the @xmath18 indices is given by the rule @xmath174 , while @xmath175 for @xmath12 , as usual .",
    "it is now a routine task to demonstrate that the yang - mills action ( [ eq1 ] ) for the positive chirality spinor ( [ spin16 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath176 where the repeated indices @xmath19 are summed over @xmath177 .",
    "some surprising simplifications follow if we now choose to work in the _ light - cone gauge _ @xmath178 . in this gauge @xmath179 , and so the ( euler - lagrange ) equation of motion for the left - moving field @xmath171 is simply @xmath180 which is evidently a non - dynamical constraint equation , since it is independent of the light - cone time .",
    "we may therefore eliminate any dependence on @xmath171 ( representing unphysical degrees of freedom ) in favour of @xmath172 , which carries the eight physical fermionic degrees of freedom in the theory .",
    "in addition , the equation of motion for the @xmath36 field yields gauss law : @xmath181 where @xmath182 + 2\\psi_{r}^t\\psi_{r}$ ] , and so the @xmath36 field may also be eliminated to leave the eight bosonic degrees of freedom @xmath183 , @xmath12 .",
    "note that the eight fermionic degrees of freedom exactly match the eight bosonic degrees of freedom associated with the transverse polarization of a ten dimensional gauge field , which is of course consistent with the supersymmetry .",
    "we should emphasize that unlike the usual covariant formulation of yang - mills , the light - cone formulation here permits one to remove _ explicitly _ any unphysical degrees of freedom in the lagrangian ( or hamiltonian ) ; there are no ghosts .",
    "the supercharges of @xmath184 matrix string theory can be obtained by the dimensional reduction of the supercharge of @xmath10 super yang - mills in ten dimension .",
