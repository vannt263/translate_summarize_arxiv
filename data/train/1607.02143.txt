    "large data samples of galaxy photometry are now available from the present epoch back to @xmath61 gyr after the big bang .",
    "hundreds of studies have described and analyzed these data in terms of luminosity , mass , and structural evolution , relying on trends between such quantities that assume a considerable uniformity of the growth of stellar populations and , by implication , of dark matter halos .",
    "several considerations , including n - body simulations , the well - populated trend of cosmic sfr density as a function of redshift ( lanzetta , wolfe , & turnshek 1995 , lilly  1996 , pei & fall 1995 , madau & dickenson 2014 ) , and the characterization of the controversially - named ` star formation main sequence ' ( sfms : noeske  2007 ; whitaker  2012)showing a correlation between stellar mass and sfr at every epoch  have guided many studies in the crafting of mean evolutionary tracks , whose nature might lend insight into the phenomena driving the evolution of individual galaxies ( e.g. , whitaker  2014 ) .",
    "however , it has been difficult to use such data to go beyond average properties and average evolution , to measuring the star formation histories ( sfhs ) of individual or classes of galaxies .",
    "such data would inform to what degree galaxies follow similar growth histories , offset or scaled in cosmic time , or whether there is genuine diversity in sfhs that is non - conformal .",
    "that is , they could demonstrate whether _ measured _ sfhs fail to conform to scenarios wherein the evolution of scaling relations _",
    "controls _ ( as opposed to _ reflects _ ) galaxy growth ( peng  2010 ; leitner  2012 ; behroozi  2013 ) , by crossing , or not appearing as offset / scaled versions of each other in mass / time .",
    "such data could also determine if the significant scatter in the sfms represents fundamental , long - term diversity in sfhs  generating an illusion of uniform growth patterns  or only distracting perturbations to physically informative ` average tracks . '",
    "the fundamental problem is that available data , including integrated mass functions over most of cosmic time , are unable to uniquely  connect the dots \" between one epoch and another : the galaxies at later epochs are not necessarily the decendants of earlier galaxies observed to follow a similar trend .",
    "abramson  ( 2016 ) has in particular emphasized the ambiguity of the presently available diagnostics by showing that models in which galaxy growth is conformal over mass , and those that show great diversity of sfhs , are both able to pass the observational tests that present data provide .",
    "the promise of ` average sfhs ' to illucidate important physical processes in galaxy evolution has arguably blinded us to the possibility that more physics will be learned from their diversity than from their sameness .",
    "this ambiguity can be broken by measuring the sfhs of individual galaxies , but this has proven very difficult to do , particularly because  from our vantage point in the local universe ",
    "stellar populations more than 2 gyr old are essentially indistinguishable from each other .",
    "for this reason ` population - synthesis models ' have been ineffective in describing the buildup of stellar mass even in relatively nearby , well observed galaxies outside the local group , although considerable progress is coming from hst - wfc3 observations , for example , the study of resolved stellar populations in m31 ( dalcanton  2012 ) .",
    "applying the population - synthesis technique at higher redshift would allow a better resolution of the ages of older populations , but spectral observations with sufficient resolution and depth are costly .",
    "one might argue that we already know that sfhs are diverse .",
    "the iconic elliptical galaxy ngc3379 in the leo group likely formed most of its stars before @xmath7 , while common galaxies of the same mass , for example , the milky way and andromeda , have been puttering along for the full age of the universe .",
    "however , the proponents of the  conformal \" model suggest that both ngc3379 and these starforming spirals are following the same growth history , but that star formation was _ quenched _ in the former by some mechanism that rendered inaccessible the considerable amount of gas still in its vicitiny . some method of forcing long cooling times by heating",
    "the gas is the likely process .",
    "suggested mechanisms include a transition from cold accretion to a hot halo driven by dark matter halo growth ( kere  2005 , dekel and birnboim 2006 ) , heating from an agn or supernovae feedback ( voit  2015b ) , or the transition from low - entropy to high - entropy gas that is unable to cool onto the host galaxy ( voit  2015a ; voit  2015c ) .    for galaxies like ngc3379 `",
    "quenching ' could have been rapid ",
    "likely a gigayear or less .",
    "but what , then , of galaxies like the milky way and andromeda ? both could have been forming stars consistently at a few  for most of a hubble time , or they could have had sfrs of @xmath610  in the first few billion years of their history , falling steadily since @xmath8 to reach their rates of @xmath61  today .",
    "it is clear from recent studies measuring ultraviolet flux and balmer absorption lines ( schawinski  2014 ; dressler & abramson 2015 , vulcani  2015a ) that galaxies traversing the color space between the ` blue cloud ' and ` red sequence ' are mostly doing so over billions of years , not in a @xmath91gyr timescale following an abrupt termination of star formation .",
    "is such a slow decline a ` quenching ? '",
    "has it been triggered by an event , such as an agn or intense feedback from star formation , or is it instead nothing more than a slow exhuastion of gas suitable for star formation ?",
    "rather than ",
    "slow quenching , \" as it is now being called ( e.g. , barro  2016 ) , perhaps this is just the normal course of galaxy evolution .",
    "both pictures have been valid , given the tools we have used to describe galaxy evolution .",
    "gladders  ( 2013 , hereinafter g13 ) developed the fast - clock / slow - clock model by assuming that galaxy sfhs are lognormal in cosmic time .",
    "this work was motivated by two observations :    * oemler  ( 2013b , hereinafter o13 ) studied distribution functions of specific star formation rates ( ssfrs ) for a sample of galaxies with redshifts @xmath10 and found that an increasing fraction had rising sfrs earlier in this epoch .",
    "the presence of such galaxies , whose abundance increasse steadily from essentially zero today to @xmath620% at @xmath8 , obviates the  @xmath11-model , \" in which the most aggressive sfh is constant in time ( tinsley 1972 ) * g13 , noted that the evolution of the cosmic sfrd ( the ` madau - lilly ' diagram ) from the present day back to @xmath12 is very well fit by a lognormal in time with two parameters , 0the half - mass time in the production of stellar mass , and @xmath11the width of the lognormal .",
    "g13 adopted this as a parameterization of sfhs of _ individual _ galaxies , and showed an existence proof that the distribution of ssfrs for 2094 present - epoch galaxies , and the cosmic sfrd , could be simulataneously fit by sum of 2094 lognormal sfhs .",
    "moreover , this model described the ssfr distributions at @xmath13 from the _ icbs _ survey ( oemler  2013a ) and ssfr distributions for samples at @xmath14 from data of _ aegis _ survey ( noeske  2007 ) .",
    "this is the model that abramson ( 2015 ) and abramson  ( 2015 , 2016 ) have found to be successful in fitting a variety of other data , including mass functions and the sfms ( zero - point , slope , and scatter ) back to @xmath15 , and zero - point and slope back to @xmath16 .",
    "encouraging as these and other results may be , these tests are incapable of distinguishing between conformity and diversity in sfhs . specifically , the work on lognormal sfhs based on the model in g13 demonstrates only that a large set of lognormal sfhs can be constructed that reproduce the available data well .",
    "but , the individual sfhs in this model can not be tagged to specific galaxies : it is only the distribution function of 0 , @xmath11 parameters , not the assignment to individual galaxies , that is robust in this approach .        in this paper",
    "we take a next step , presenting what we believe is compelling evidence for sfh diversity , using well - measured though coarse sfrs and mass buildup for over 22,494 galaxies over the epoch @xmath17 from the carnegie - spitzer - imacs ( csi ) survey .",
    "following the recent custom in colloquia of presenting conclusions at the start , we move immediately to a graphic presentation of our principal result on the diversity of sfhs .",
    "the customary discussion of the data and its analysis that compel this result _ follows _ , and this is used to develop a different , more quantitative description of the data based on the mass of ` old ' and ` young ' stellar populations .",
    "the most direct observational test of conformity in galaxy sfhs is to compare their sfrs over a wide range of epochs .",
    "the seds measured in csi survey span from restframe uv to through the near - ir and include low - resolution spectro - photometry that provide exactly this information .",
    "we present in this section a diagram of 240 randomly - selected sfhs from csi survey data that represent what we believe is a decisive test of the conformity versus diversity issue .    the csi survey and its methodology is thoroughly described in kelson  ( 2014a , hereinafter k14 ) and in greater detail in section 4 than described now .",
    "the subsample of csi we use here is representative : flux - limited from spitzer - irac 3.6@xmath18 imaging over @xmath65.3 square degrees in the swire - xmm - lss field ( see k14 ) .",
    "flux to cover the luminosity peak of common galaxies , the csi survey is closer to mass - limited than comparable studies . ]",
    "additional photometry in the near - ir ( j and k bands ) came from observations with _",
    "( autry  2003 ) , and red - optical to ultraviolet was obtained by reprocessing _ ugriz _",
    "data from the cfht legacy survey .",
    "prism mode ( dressler  2011 ) was used to obtain low - resolution spectra ( _ r _ @xmath19 ) from @xmath20  for @xmath643,000 galaxies in this field .",
    "the present study uses a 22,494 galaxy subsample of these data covering the redshift interval @xmath0 .    in k14 stellar population models",
    "were made using maraston ( 2005 ) ; subsequently the data have been reprocessed using the conroy , gunn , & white ( 2009 ) and conroy & gunn ( 2010 ) _ flexible stellar population synthesis _ ( fsps ) models , to take advantage of its improved modeling of the tp - agb .",
    "all stellar mass and sfrs are based on a chabrier ( 2003 ) initial mass function .",
    "k14 parsed the csi sfhs into six age bins , with model seds for each age bin summed in generalized maximum likelihood fits to the observed prism and broadband fluxes simultaneously .",
    "the model sed for each age bin was replicated at four quantized levels of dust attenuation in @xmath21 for a total of 24 stellar population components being non - negatively summed in each fit . allowing each component to have variable dust attenuation",
    "is a crude attempt to allow for variable spatial distribution of dust with respect to the underlying distributions of stars .",
    "more details can be found in section 3 .",
    "each model , described by a _ constant _ sfr over each of the six age bins ( or _ time intervals _ ) can be effectively reduced to mean sfrs on three timescles@xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath4 years :    * sfr1 : @xmath24 for  gyr ( k14 time interval 1 ) * sfr2 : 1 gyr to 200 myr before  ( intervals 2 - 5 ) * sfr3 : 200 myr to  ( interval 6 )    where  is the age of the universe at the time of observation , and  is the duration of the first epoch of star formation ( a parameter of the fit ) , starting at @xmath24 , 1.2 gyr , and potentially lasting until 1 gyr before  ( but usually stopping well before this . )    these measurments are largely independent : the oldest population ( sfr1 ) is constrainted by the ir flux , the intermediate age ( sfr2 ) comes from the rest - frame - optical photometry and prism spectrum ( the light from main - sequence a - stars ) , and the  present \" sfr formation ( sfr3 , averaged over the last 200 myr ) is measured through reframe uv flux below the balmer break .    using these measures of stellar mass growth over different periods of a galaxy s lifetime",

    "the four panels in figure 1 are plots of log sfr vs. redshift over four ranges of total stellar mass : from log m = 11.012.1   ( upper left ) to log m = 9.010.0  ( lower right ) .",
    "the red , green , and blue points of figure 1 represent the well - measured sfrs for timescales of @xmath3 , and @xmath4 years .",
    "the mass bins are well populated , with 1785 , 8279 , 9062 , and 3385 galaxies , respectively . however ,",

    "for display we have randomly scattered the non - detections in a log distribution from @xmath27 log sfr @xmath28 . , mixing them with the low s / n detections . )",
    "the systematic trends of the sfr measurements is apparent .",
    "the sfhs of the most massive galaxies ( upper left panel ) generally decline , from the high sfrs of stellar populations that are observed at ages of @xmath292 - 6 gyr , to the sfrs of 1 gyr - old and 200 myr - old populations .",
    "not all massive galaxies exhibit steeply declining sfhs : a substantial fraction show gently declining sfrs over a hubble time , perhaps representing more massive , or more vigorously starforming , versions of the milky way ( m101 ?",
    "there are , however , no _ young galaxies _ in this mass range , that is , ` late - bloomers ' whose sfrs rose from the old population to the younger ones .",
    "a move in this direction begins in the second mass bin , log m = 10.511.0 , characteristic of the milky way mass today , where the sfrs typically fall more slowly than for the most massive sample , and there are @xmath65 out of 60 galaxies that are ` young . '",
    "the typical sfhs in the top right panel look about as we speculated ( in section 1 ) for the milky way : an initial period with sfr @xmath6 10 - 20 , declining steadily to perhaps @xmath63  at @xmath30 , headed toward today s level of @xmath61 .",
    "the bottom two panels , on the left , log m = 10.010.5 ( a factor of 2 - 3 below m@xmath31 at @xmath32tomczak  2014 ) and on the right , log m = 9.010.0 , show a large cohort of sfhs that are slowly declining ( m33 ? ) or near - constant ( ngc253 ? ) .",
    "but , here the ` young galaxy ' population has become more obvious : @xmath650% of the population in the log m = 10.010.5 ( lower - left panel ) are young, and these rising sfhs dominate the lower right panel .",
    "because they are remote , some sfrs measured for old stellar populations ( sfr1the red points ) suffer a systematic error relating to how well the sed fit was able to decouple sfr1 from , the timescale over which that mass was produced  the two quantities are covariant . repeated measurements ( discussed in section 4 ) indicate that  is able to distinguish between old populations and very old populations with limited fidelity . , which is the mass produced in this epoch , is well measured , as we also show in section 4 .",
    "] among the data are very high sfr values ( exceeding 100 ) , the result of improbably short  ( less than 1 gyr  an artifact of the fitting procedure ) , which biased the sfrs high .",
    "figure 1 would have included a small fraction of these inflated sfrs ; the correction we made ( by redistributing the  @xmath33 gyr values between @xmath34 gyr ) lowers only these highest sfrs  there is no effect on the sfhs with _ rising _ sfrs , our principal interest . in section 4",
    "we sidestep this covariance problem by switching from sfrs to comparing the ratio of ` old ' and ` young ' stellar mass .",
    "figure 1 shows , then , that a substantial population of galaxies in the lower two panels are genuine cases where no ` old ' star formation ( sfr1 ) has been detected ( in effect , an upper limit @xmath65@xmath35  in ` old ' stellar mass , as we discuss in section 4 ) .",
    "it is this population of ` young galaxies ' that o13 inferred and _ required _ , based on comparisons of ssfr distributions from @xmath36 .",
    "this , then , is the crux of this paper , to show specific cases  thousands  where in - situ growth after @xmath5 dominates the stellar mass .",
    "these are not simply cases of  downsizing , \" that is , extended star formation over a hubble time , which could be considered scaled sfh copies of more massive galaxies on a falling sfms  a conformal population .",
    "rather , these are galaxies that peak late , or have not peaked at all , and for which star formation lasts a few gyr before fading by the present day .",
    "these are the ` late - bloomers ' of the g13 lognormal sfhs  galaxies with long 0 and short @xmath11that are a certain sign of diversity in sfhs ( see figure 10 , discussed in section 5 ) .",
    "there is also evidence from figure 1 that ",
    "although sfh diversity as a whole shifts to more extended histories with decreasing mass  there is considerable sfh diversity at _ the same stellar mass_. we see this expansive diversity at similar stellar mass as _",
    "fundamental_. in conformal models , the scatter in the sfms is treated as inconsequential .    to explore this behavior ,",
    "we define four sfhs representative of the diversity we see in the graphic tracts in figure 1 . in what follows , _",
    "sfr1 , sfr2 , and sfr3 _ are the log@xmath37 values of sfr1 , sfr2 , and sfr3 .",
    "the categories , for illustrative purposes ( not to be taken as _ definitions _ ) are :    1 .",
    "red = old galaxy ( falling sfh ) 2 .",
    "amber = csf ( continuous sfh ) 3 .",
    "green : young galaxy : ( constant or rising sfh ) 4 .",
    "blue = starburst ( or ) purple = starburst    figure 2 plots our entire csi sample broken down into these categories . , and the higher - density cluster / supercluster at @xmath38 are familiar features in such diagrams . ]",
    "the trend with mass is unmistakable : from old stellar population dominance ; through continuous star formation ( csf ) over a hubble time ( declining  milky way - like , or constant  ngc253 , lmc - like ? ) ; to genuinely young galaxies .",
    "an added  frosting \" of starburst galaxies is found for both the csf and ` young ' galaxy populations ( but rarely for ` old ' galaxies ) .",
    "to quantify this population of young galaxies , we will in the sections to follow shift the emphasis from sfrs to stellar mass buildup . before proceeding , however , we return to the point made through figure 1 , now abundantly on display in figure 2 , that the diversity of sfhs is a strong function of mass .",
    "but , more than this , it is the overlap of these populations , shown by decomposing the left hand multi - color panel into its four components , that is arresting .",
    "` old ' galaxies , those with strongly declining sfrs , cover more than an order - of - magnitude in total stellar mass , limited perhaps only by csi depths and sensitivities , and csf span an order - of - magnitude in stellar mass as well .",
    "the most remarkable fact is that young galaxies , although much less common , are found up to and beyond the mass of the milky way . and",
    "fade by the present epoch , clear examples of the long 0short @xmath11 behavior that can occur in the lognormal picture . ] in other words , even galaxies as massive as the milky way  not just low - mass galaxies  can follow strikingly different sfhs .",
    "our csi data appear , at a minimum , to confirm the general breakdown of conformity described by abramson  ( 2016 ) in their interpretation of sfms scatter as a consequence of the lognormal sfh model .    from that conclusion",
    "it is a short step to postulating that galaxies with the same dark - matter - halo mass evolved along very different sfhs , raising questions about the fidelity of the popular practice of  abundance matching \" ( e.g. conroy & wechsler 2009 ) .",
    "if true , what drives this diversity ?",
    "we are drawn to the notion that such differences are built - in from an early epoch ( as promoted by dressler in his 1980 study of the morphology - density relation ) , perhaps related to the density of the dark matter halo or larger - scale properties of the spectrum of density perturbations in a galaxy s neighborhood .",
    "although this possibility is not compelled by the results of this study , we will explore some aspects of this problem later in the paper .",
    "to this point we have examined sfhs in terms of sfrs in three distinct epochs , acknowledging that a star formation history is the evolution of the star formation rate . however , a more quanitative evaluation using the mass fractions of old and young stars will serve better to understanding what these histories mean in terms of building galaxies , and in the comparison to models .",
    "we invite the reader to continue to appreciate the full implications of diversity in sfhs .",
    "section 3 describes in detail the csi data and how they are analyzed to provide ( independent ) sfrs over timescales of @xmath3 , and @xmath4 years . in section 4",
    "we turn the analysis to the buildup of stellar mass , showing how the ratio of two integrated masses  stellar mass produced from z=5 to 1 gyr before observation , and stellar mass produced in the last gigayear , provides a very good tool for searching for the ` late - bloomers ' that o13 ` required . ' while o13 was unable to point to specific galaxies that had rising sfrs after @xmath5 , we _ can _ identify individual galaxies of this population . in section 5",
    "we look for correlations of sfhs related to environment , specifically , signs of a centrals / satellites dichotomy . in section 6",
    "we examine the consistency of the g13 model with csi sfhs in terms of the full range of sfhs we find .",
    "finally , in section 7 we summarize our results on sfh diversity and review the implications for conformal ( plus _ quenching _ ) models .",
    "the defining characteristics of the csi survey were large areal coverage ( 15 sq deg over three widely separated _ swire _ fields ) , galaxy selection via spitzer - irac 3.6@xmath18 flux , and near - ir to optical - ultraviolet photometry and low - resolution spectroscopy from 4500  to 10,000 , corresponding to rest frame 3462  at the @xmath39 lower limit , and 5263  at the @xmath40 upper limit , for the subsample used in this paper . flux measurements at 3.6@xmath18 sample the peak of the energy distribution in seds for typical galaxies at @xmath41 . because of this , the stellar mass completeness limit changes much more slowly with redshift than in previous spectroscopic surveys selected by _",

    "figure 3 shows observational data and model seds for 4 representative galaxies in the survey , including the 6 discrete intervals of star formation ( the  basis sets \" for fitting stellar population models the sed , described below ) that are used to measure sfrs over timescales of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath4 years . each box is a plot of observed wavelength and @xmath49 flux .",

    "it is apparent for these four cases that each derived seds is an excellent match to the broad - band photometry and blue - to - red spectra .",
    "k14 emphasizes that the fine detail contained in the spectra play a particularly important role in constraining redshift to @xmath92% , a better performance than is possible with broad - band photometric data alone .",
    "redshifts of this accuracy are essential for sampling the prism spectra at the proper wavelengths , and vice - versa .",
    "this degree of accuracy in the redshift was also intended as an important feature the csi survey , because it allowed the association of galaxies into groups and clusters .",
    "this environmental component of the survey , which we exploit in section 5 , is something that can not be achieved with redshifts of lower precision .",
    "as was remarked in section 2 , the power of the csi data set with respect to sfhs is bound up in the several stellar evolution timescales inherent in the data .",
    "the k14 analysis recognized this explicitly by adopting six time intervals , over which the sfr was assumed to be constant , as the  basis sets \" for _ solving _ the sed .",
    "five of the six are fixed time intervals of 200 myr that started 1 gyr before : star formation over this period produces strong variations in the blue - to - visible sed that provide very effective constraints on the model .",
    "the sfr1 interval , starting at z@xmath505 , takes advantage of ( and suffers from ) the immobility of the giant branch in color - magnitude - diagrams for stellar popualtions with ages ranging from 2 gyr to a hubble time .",
    "while it is straightforward to measure the stellar mass producing the light from old populations  the product sfr1@xmath51the giant - branch degeneracy makes  alone difficult to constrain , and thus sfr1 has a typical error of @xmath650% , a factor - of - two larger than for sfr3 and sfr2 , the combination of the remaining four intervals , as discussed in section 2 .",
    "because of the uncertainty in determining , the k14 analysis allowed the ( constant ) star formation starting at z@xmath505 to continue up to 1 gyr prior to .",
    "however , the constraint on  improves if light from main sequence stars makes a significant contribution to the sed . from the vantage point of present - day galaxies",

    "the median for our sample  the contribution from dwarf f - stars ( with main - sequence liftetimes of @xmath65 gyr ) can be detected as far back as @xmath522 , the peak epoch of cosmic star formation .",
    "for this reason the csi spectral data have some leverage on _ when _ the stars of the first interval were formed , not just how many .",
    "may not be well constrained , but neither is it unconstrained .",
    "we believe that this is why most  values fall in the reasonable range of 2 - 6 gyr , timed to the f - star contribution detected in the blue - to - visible part of the prism spectra .",
    "this would also explain why a there is a small but significant population with  @xmath26 1 gyr ",
    "such dubious measurements are likely to be the default ` @xmath53 function ' at @xmath24 when there is no measureable signal from an old f - star population ( exacerbated , we think , by the discretation of  into small lorarithmic intervals as log  approaches zero ) .",
    "examples can be seen in figure 3 in the two middle boxes above each sed .",
    "the left box shows the sfh expressed as constant sfrs in six time intervales , as explained above , and the right box shows the integral of the sfh , e.g. , the buildup of stellar mass .",
    "the galaxies of the top two panels contain only old stars , according to the model .",
    "the case on the left is one of prompt star formation in the first few gyr ( short ) , while for the galaxy on the right the model has settled on a long history of early star formation that continues up to the last gyr before .",
    "no star formation has been detected in any of the final five 200 myr time intervals .",
    "( the integrated mass does not increase in the five colored bins . )",
    "both galaxies fall into the  passive \" region of the uvj diagram ( williams  2009 ) .",
    "it is not obvious looking at the prism spectra why sed fiting process has extended sfr1 star formation to relatively late times .",
    "this could be a sign of the f - star contribution just discussed , but this effect is expected to be subtle .",
    "we are working on a variation of the d4000 index suitable for such low resolution data in an effort to tease out the subtle markers of such longer - than - intermediate - aged star formation .",
    "in contrast , the galaxies in the two bottom panels appear to have had considerable late - epoch star formation .",
    "the galaxy on the left has accumulated most of its @xmath64 @xmath54  from between 1 and 4 gyr after the big bang . according to the model .",
    "the star formation in the last two interals , starting 400 myr before , add only a little mass ( see the right box ) , but the changes to the sed are dramatic . in particular , the strong upturn in the ultraviolet flux , and the peaks in the sed from [ o ii ] and [ o iii ] emission , are indicative of vigorous star formation in the interval that records the final @xmath55 years .",
    "the galaxy is firmly in the ` starforming ' part of the uvj diagram .",
    "the galaxy on the bottom right is a good example of the principal result of this paper : this massive galaxy of 10@xmath56  is almost entirely composed of young stars , according to the model , which records only a small amount of star formation up to 1 gyr _ before _",
    ", with all the rest in the last gyr .",
    "note also lack of star formation in the final ( 200 myr ) interval , as the absence of an ultraviolet upturn confirms  this galaxy is in the ` passive region ' of the uvj diagram .",
    "although the sed looks similar to the passive galaxy directly above it , a closer look at the blue part of the spectrum reveals important differences : the d4000 break and g - band , so prominent in the upper right example of an old galaxy , are not present in the bottom right galaxy .",
    "the spectrum of this galaxy is essentially pure a - stars , the unambiguous signature of a @xmath61 gyr population .",
    "the data just discussed were drawn from a catalog of 33,089 measurements of objects at 0.3@xmath570.9 in the xmm field .",
    "this included 4665 repeated observations , and 366 galaxies with three measurements .",
    "from the extensive error analysis described in k14 , a quality parameter r(_s / n _ ) was used to pare the sample to r @xmath26 1.8 ( slightly better than the q@xmath502 rating in a three - tiered system ",
    "see k14 , figure 8) for single observations .",
    "multiple observations were combined when r @xmath26 2.5 ( slightly worse than q@xmath502 ) for each measurement .",
    "our final catalog contains 22,494 individual galaxies , where the 27,692 unique objects have been further trimmed by 5198 galaxies below the quality cut .",
    "figure 4 plots the redshift determined for each of the 4666 galaxies with duplicate measurements . from the statistics of the differences in the pairs of measurements , we find @xmath58 for the redshift error per observation . for the median redshift of the sample",
    "@xmath59 this value is in good agreement with the @xmath60 found in the extensive error analysis done by k14 .",
    "as described in section 2 , the sfr in the first @xmath65 gyr is covariant with , the sed model s fit to the duration of star formation that began at z@xmath505 , @xmath61 1.2 gyr . on the other hand , the _ stellar mass _ in this and later epochs",
    "is well constrained by the infrared portion of the sed . to exploit this , and to quantify the diversity of sfhs , we chose to characterize the galaxies simply in terms of ` old ' and ` young ' stellar mass , defining the first as star formation that began at z@xmath505 and lasted typically 26 gyr for this sample , and the second as star formation taking place in the last gyr before .",
    "we then define _",
    "z5fract _ , the integral of the stellar mass produced as :    @xmath62    where all sfrs are in gyr@xmath63 .    that is , _",
    "z5fract _ is the ratio of old/(old+young ) star formation .",
    "figure 5 shows this result through a histogram of the mass distributions of galaxies with more than 50% ( red ) , and less than 50% ( blue ) , of their mass in an old population . there is a clear mass dependence , analogous to that found for the sfhs in section 2 , in the sense that the fraction of ` young ' galaxies rises to lower mass : at approximately 10@xmath64",
    "there is a 50 - 50 mix of galaxies that formed most of their mass early , and those that formed it late .",
    "this simple parameterization confirms and quantifies the results based on sfrs we presented in section 2 : ( 1 ) there is a diversity of sfhs at all galaxy masses above 10@xmath1 ; and ( 2 ) a significant fraction of galaxies at 0.3@xmath570.9 are _ young _ , that is , they formed most of their stellar mass after z@xmath501 .    with the 4666 repeated measurements in the csi _ xmm _ sample , as restricted to @xmath0 , it is straightforward to determine how well these two epochs of stellar mass are constrained by the sed fitting process . figure 6 plots derived stellar mass for pairs of measurments of the old and young populations . above 10@xmath1 , the stellar mass within the final gyr ( left ) shows a scatter of 0.28 dex , or a factor of 1.9the increase in scatter at the low - mass end is dominated by the high - redshift part of the sample .",
    "the scatter for the old population above 10@xmath64 shown in the right plot , is only 0.21 dex , or a factor of 1.6 .",
    "the uncertainty increases rapidly below 10@xmath64not surprisingly , it is very difficult to detect @xmath65  of old stars in an intermediate - redshift galaxy .",
    "these expected errors are appropriate uncertainties for the @xmath617,000 individual measurements of the 22,494 galaxies in the sample , with expected improvement for the @xmath65000 multiple measurements that we have co - added .    based on the factor - of - two or less uncertainty in the measured masses ,",
    "the result in figure 5 is robust .",
    "a possible concern is the fact that , in the high redshift end of our sample , the csi survey has significant incompleteness for  passive \" galaxies with masses @xmath63 @xmath51 10@xmath1 .",
    "the worry might be that the ` young galaxy ' phenomenon is exaggerated by a failure to detect an old population in these low mass galaxies .",
    "however , figure 5 shows that the majority of such galaxies found in our study have total masses of 10@xmath64  or greater  over most of this redshift range , even the ` old ' mass is reliably detected . for the galaxies with total mass 10@xmath64 , the @xmath261 gyr population is secure , which means that , as _ z5fract _ trends lower , the fraction of mass left for the ` old ' population is small : underestimates of that mass",
    "have no consequence , and overestimates have a small range because masses above 5 @xmath66   should have been detected .",
    "the potentially missing galaxies are the ones that have total masses below 5 @xmath66  with little or no younger population .    in summary , while there might be more ` old galaxies ' missing through incompleteness , the ones below 10@xmath64  that we identify as ` young ' ( _ z5fract _ @xmath26 0.5 ) are secure .",
    "lower limits of 10@xmath1  and 10@xmath64  for masses of the young and old stellar populations are sufficient to determine the fraction of old stellar mass for our sample . by comparing 4666 pairs of _",
    "z5fract _ values we find that these have typical errors of 0.33 dex , accurate enough to reliably separate the sample at",
    "_ z5fract _",
    "@xmath50 0.5 .",
    "in section 2 we went from modest numbers of example sfhs in figure 1 to a redshift - mass plot ( figure 2 ) that displayed the entire sample sfhs as discreet classes  by colors .",
    "here we do the same , by using points of four colors to display the full range of _ z5fract _ as a proxy for sfhs , over its full range , 0.0 @xmath26 _ z5fract _",
    "@xmath26 1.0 .",
    "figure 7 shows four equal ranges that resemble the sfh categories of figure 2 .",
    "while the sfhs in section 2 were defined by _ ad hoc _ changes in sfr from one epoch to another , the _ z5fract _ values coded into figure 7 record a continuous variation in sfh from galaxies that are exclusively ` old ' to those that are largely , if not completely , ` young . '    as in figure 2 , the most striking thing about the distribution of the red points , @xmath68 ( upper left panel ) is the more - than - an - order - of - magnitude range of mass of this population dominated by old stellar mass .",
    "the ` oldest ' galaxies in our sample are not limited to the most massive ones ; indeed , their frequency of occurrence is roughly mass - independent down to a factor of 30 smaller than the most massive galaxies in the sample .",
    "the falling trend with redshift for the highest masses is due to the decreasing volume of the survey , while the bottom envelope is indicative of the mass incompleteness of the csi sample as a function of redshift , as seen in the modeling of section 6 .",
    "the @xmath68 interval includes _ all traditional sfhs _ , that is , those that were either constant or declining with cosmic time ( discussed further in section 6 ) . for the median redshift of sample , @xmath59 , the time from redshift @xmath24 to 1 gyr before  is 6.6 gyr ,",
    "so a constant sfr of any amount will produce @xmath69 .",
    "declining sfhs , such as the inimitable @xmath11-model , will be larger , up to @xmath70 for a  passive \" galaxy .",
    "this means that , even in this category of the ` oldest ' galaxies , there must be sfhs that had rising sfrs for some time after @xmath24 .",
    "the same can be said for _ all _ the galaxies in the well - populated @xmath71 category ( upper - right panel ) : these may have declining sfhs at , but in order to reach 25% to 50% fractions of young stars in the last gyr before , the old population must also have been rising for as long as several gigayears after @xmath24 .",
    "this in itself ( exclusive of our case for ` younger ' galaxies ) points to a diversity of star formation rise times for galaxies that are dominated by old stellar mass and is inconsistent with the idea of conformal sfhs that all began with the same growth pattern  long _ before _ the peak star formation . on the other hand ,",
    "it is natural in the lognormal sfh model , as we discuss in section 6 .",
    "it is notable that this _ amber _ distribution is more steeply falling than the distributions in the other 3 panels .",
    "as we surmise in section 7 , the sfrs for these galaxies peak in the redshift range @xmath72 , so over the @xmath73 epoch of our sample , the total stellar mass ( at ) of galaxies that land in this _ z5fract _ range is falling . once again , however , at every epoch the mass range of such sfhs is wide  the points represent galaxies with a substantial range in decline rate .",
    "in contrast , the galaxies with @xmath74 ( bottom left panel ",
    "green points ) and @xmath75 ( bottom right panel  blue points ) , do not show the relatively steep trend line seen for the _ amber _ galaxies .",
    "the shallow decline of these distribution with mass seems to align with the notion that many of these are galaxies with a longer 0  that are observed closer to the peak sfrs .",
    "however , the most interesting feature of these distributions may be the swell in numbers around @xmath30 , which are sensibly identified as the long 0 , short @xmath11 population postulated by o13 and whose identification was the main motivation for this analysis of the csi data .",
    "it is perhaps the most striking feature of figure 7 that so many of these genuinely young galaxies peak at @xmath30 and rapidly disappear thereafter , to be essentially gone by @xmath76 , at least those with m@xmath77 .",
    "figure 7 is rich in information with respect to sfhs , but a framework is needed to understand the longitudinal nature of the samples in these diagrams . as we show in section 6 , the g13 lognormal sfh provides one such tool .",
    "the influence of local environment on galaxy evolution remains an important yet unresolved issue .",
    "the morphology - density relation was interpreted by dressler ( 1980 ) as the result of very early environment ( to explain the very weak trend of population gradients for such a wide range of present - epoch local density ) that was manifest in the @xmath78 universe but not likely produced by it .",
    "it is of course likely the sfhs and morphology are closely coupled , so the present study can be seen as related to the earlier work .",
    "as has been pointed out widely in recent years , morphology correlates most strongly with galaxy mass ( dressler 2007 ; van den bosch  2008 ) , which suggests that what has been attributed to local environment can be largely reduced to a statement like ` denser environments host galaxies of higher mass than lower density regions . '",
    "while dressler inferred from this that the conditions for making more massive , and therefore early type galaxies , were imprinted at a very early epoch , others have focused on specific processes associated with dark matter halo growth .",
    "van den bosch  ( 2003 , 2008 ; see also conroy & wechsler 2009 ) was among the first to develop a now popular picture in which the capture of lower mass  satellite \" galaxies by higher - mass  central galaxies \" ( and the stripping of the halos of the former ) is a primary mechanism for shaping sfhs of galaxies and , presumably , their morphologies .    while a thorough investigation of the ` centrals and satellites ' paradigm is beyond the scope of this paper , the csi survey s ability to assess the environments of sample galaxies through its spectro - photometric redshift precision of @xmath92% , makes it straightforward to take a first look at how sfhs determined in the manner of this study fit in this picture .",
    "galaxy number densities , and local mass densities , for the 22,494 galaxies of our sample were calculated using projected co - moving circles of 1 , 2 , and 4 mpc .",
    "figure 8 refigures the relationships of figure 7 for samples that include only the @xmath611% of galaxies that reside in the densest environments , corresponding to projected densities of ` m2 ' @xmath79 12 @xmath54  mpc@xmath80 , and ` n2 ' @xmath79 2.7 galaxies mpc@xmath80 .",
    "[ fig : g13d16 ]        from one standpoint , showing the data of figure 8 is one way answer questions about the content of previous diagrams in this paper , specifically , whether _ satellites _ and _ centrals _ need to be treated separately , because  in this picture  many galaxies in dense regions are satellites , while most of the galaxies in sparse regions are centrals. in fact , though , figure 7 and figure 8 are so similar that removing the latter s points from figure 7 would make no discernible change .",
    "it is clear , then , that the analysis we have made showing the diversity of sfhs does not show a strong environmental dependence .",
    "( it is important to qualify , however , that there are no rich clusters of galaxies in the csi xmm region . )    but , a more fundamental point can be made about the way the different _",
    "z5fract _ subsets in figures 7 and 8 are distributed in mass : _ they appear the same_. figure 8 has larger fractions of ` old ' galaxies than the complete sample , 69% and 74% compared to the full sample s 62% .",
    "this is a global average , of course : looking at the dense regions at @xmath81 and @xmath82 , the proportion of `` old '' galaxies is even larger .",
    "this is a natural expression of the stronger clustering of more massive , old galaxies  these trace the large scale structure more clearly than previous diagrams .",
    "nevertheless , the distributions in mass for each subset appear indistinguishable  even in these densest regions , and even though their proportions are different . in other words",
    ", there are different proportions of sfhs , but when they occur , their properties are the same .",
    "this is a familiar finding for studies of galaxy properties in different environment : for example , the standard morphological types look the same and share the same properties in regions of high and low density , even though the proportions of these types are very different .",
    "our brief treatment of this question is insufficient , but this quick look indicates that it is unlikely that the proposed satellite / central dichotomy plays a major role in shaping sfhs of galaxies in the most common environments  from relatively isolated galaxies to groups of 10s of galaxies .",
    "as figures 7 and 8 show , genuinely young galaxies exist over a wide mass range , @xmath83@xmath84 and , though their abundances and masses decrease after @xmath85 , are present at all epochs this study has probed .",
    "the large spreads of masses and times at which young systems are found is the `` smoking gun '' of the kind of sfh diversity that distinguishes the g13 and kelson ( 2014b ) sfh paradigms from more conformal pictures , wherein physical inferences rely on the assumption that galaxies of a given stellar mass can be well described by a common sfh ( plus a quenching event ) .",
    "the data clearly suggest that a substantial amount of astrophysics can not be captured by such approaches .",
    "an examination of the model predictions of g13 for how figure 7 _ should _ look helps us understand these issues .",
    "figure 9 is a reproduction of figure 7 based on the suite of g13 lognormal sfhs .",
    "the points are colored identically in the two figures , which are also based on the same definition of _ z5fract _ ( see section 4 ) .",
    "the shaded regions echo the completeness and volumetric effects evident in the data , although we leave them semi - transparent to show the full range of the model measurements .",
    "as shown in the large ( left ) panel of figure 9 , g13 exhibits all of the qualitative trends seen in the data : there is a broad diversity in sfhs at all stellar masses and epochs , such that that ` young ' galaxies ( _ z5fract _ @xmath86 ) occupy most of the diagram , but also display a tendency to lower masses .",
    "the subpanels in figure 9 ( right ) make the above points slightly more quantitatively . here , we see that g13 shows that the ` youngest ' systems ( _ _ z5fract__@xmath87 ; blue points ) reach @xmath88 , but mainly at the earliest epochs probed : very few of these systems appear above @xmath89  at @xmath39 , just as is seen in the data .",
    "the green points reach to higher masses at slightly later times , on up to the oldest galaxies ( red points ) , which span all masses above @xmath22msun  at all epochs .",
    "is the @xmath90 mass limit of the g13 model . ]",
    "such agreement is reassuring : it suggests that the g13 model captures or encodes at least some of the relevant astrophysical processes that more conformal approaches average - out .",
    "however , once we move beyond the above metrics , the g13 model results begin to diverge quantitatively from the data . specifically , in its current form , g13 does not produce the right _ fractions _ of the _",
    "z5fract _ classes : while , at @xmath91the median redshift of the sample  the data reveal abundances of 56% , 18% , 10% , and 16% for the red , amber , green , and blue objects , respectively , g13 yields instead 81% , 13% , 3% , and 2% ( @xmath922% ) .    yet , this discrepancy is easy to understand : while 1 gyr is a timescale on which spectral features change  and thus a natural timescale to use to _ assess _ sfhs  it is _ not _ a _ natural _ timescale .",
    "for example , in the kelson ( 2014b ) scheme , sfhs fluctuate on _ all _ timescales with a `` memory '' of a hubble - time .",
    "similarly , in the g13 scheme , sfhs fluctuate on @xmath11-like timescales  ranging from 1 to many gyr  and are diversified from each other also over hubble - times .",
    "as such , instead of comparing g13 to the csi data by matching measurement definitions , we can compare the two by matching definitions of _ youth_. to do this , we redefine g13 _",
    "z5fract _ as : @xmath93 where @xmath94 gyr is the mean @xmath11 value for the g13 sfhs . here , _",
    "z5fract _ becomes the fraction of mass formed before most sfhs can have changed from a low to high , or high to low state of star formation .    with this modification , the g13-predicted abundances for the _",
    "z5fract _ classes moves much closer in - line with what is observed : 63% , 21% , 10% , and 6% ( @xmath923% ) again compared to 56% , 18% , 10% , and 16% in the data",
    "( high - to - low _ z5fract _ ) .",
    "so , what can we learn from this more physically aligned model classification ?",
    "figure 10 ( left ) shows the g13 @xmath95 plane  the natural description of galaxies in this model  with all sfhs color - coded by their g13 _ z5fract _ ( based on @xmath96 ) at @xmath91 . as anticipated ( see sections 2 and 4 ) , sfh stratification is mainly based on peak - time , demarcated by the blue curved lines : high g13 _",
    "z5fract _ objects have early peaking sfhs ( @xmath97 ) , with peak times moving to later epochs with lower g13 _ _ z5fract__s . indeed , as revealed by a look at the example sfhs for each class shown at _",
    "right _ , the breakdown is nearly exactly as stated in section 4 based on the data : while red sfhs are falling rapidly , amber objects are falling more gently , green objects are being observed near their peak of star formation , and blue ones are still on the rise , peaking sometime between @xmath98 and today .    yet",
    ", the subtleties expressed within each class are revealing beyond this .",
    "for example , though the red objects are ` old'and indeed will nearly all be dead by today ( dotted vertical lines in _ right _ panels)many are still actively starforming at the epoch of observation ( dashed vertical lines ) .",
    "this belies a key point : _ galaxies with constant sfhs will fall into the highest g13 _ z5fract _ bin at these epochs .",
    "_ hence , _ old does not mean dead_. ( this point is clarified by noticing that many of the red points lie between the orange curves of constant @xmath99 in figure 10 , left ) . )    furthermore , looking at the amber curves we see that even some systems with high g13 _ z5fracts _ ( @xmath7950% ) can have _ rising _ sfhs ( or relatively late starts ) .",
    "this suggests that the current practice of modeling sfhs  not only for high - redshift galaxies , but even intermediate - redshift galaxies  with exponentially _ declining _ sfhs can often be a mistake , and serves as a ` yellow flag ' to our intuitions .",
    "such are the effects induced by a two - parameter ( or zero - parameter , in the case of kelson [ 2014b ] ) sfh model .    to the extent that those frameworks describe reality  which we think is substantial ( gladders 2013 ; kelson 2014b ; abramson 2015 ;",
    "abramson  2016)the above results thus suggest that identifying _",
    "what _ determines a galaxy s location in @xmath95 space  or a similar plane to be defined for the kelson model  is paramount .",
    "that is , even knowing a galaxy is ` old ' is not enough to pin down its sfh , that is , there is no ` typical ' history , as our discussion of the _ red_ and _ amber _ points highlights .",
    "additional physics could have _ substantially _ influenced  not merely perturbed  some members of a given class differently than others , and these are perhaps _ the _ critical processes to characterize .",
    "the data in this study can not uniquely reveal such causal mechanisms , but we can combine our discussion of environment in section 4 with the g13 model results to come up with a hypothesis :    the fractions of the _",
    "z5fract _ classes change in denser regions ( figure 8) , but not the overall trends ( figure 7 ) .",
    "this suggests a scenario in which late - time environmental effects ( e.g. , stripping , strangulation ) simply do not play a large role .",
    "if they did , the _ z5fract _ patterns in figure 8 would be sensitive to the ( diverse ) infall histories of groups and the subsequent ( chaotic ) existences of galaxies ` post - acquisition . '",
    "that they  and a host of structural ( e.g. , allen  2016 ; morishita  2016 ) , and star formation - related properties ( e.g. , peng  2010 ; newman  2014 ; vulcani  2015b)appear _ not _ to be sensitive is evidence that galaxy histories are _ correlated with _",
    "the history of their environment , but not _ causally connected _ to their presence in it at any given time .",
    "that is , most of the interesting physics controlling sfhs must be `` baked - in '' at the _",
    "start _ of halo growth , that is , very early on .",
    "this is the scenario presented by dressler ( 1980 ) . as discussed by abramson  ( 2016 ) , because each galaxy is assigned a @xmath95 coordinate at birth in the g13 model , it is _ also _ the scenario that framework naturally describes . in either , galaxies in ( rare ) isolated high - density halos _ can _ have the same early - peaking sfhs as those in denser regions , but because a common initial `` low - frequency '' mode will push the galaxy - scale peaks riding on top of it to collapse earlier , such objects will be significantly biased towards what will become groups and clusters .",
    "environment thus determines a global preference for @xmath100i.e . , low values  but does not fundamentally restrict them . in this way , though it need not have been , a scenario in which initial conditions largely determine sfhs is fully consistent with the new measurements presented here .",
    "our principle conclusions are :    1 .   coarse sfhs from the csi survey exhibit a diversity of star formation histories that are non - conformal",
    ". that is , they are neither replicas nor appear organized by the behavior of macroscopic / population - level scaling laws .",
    "rather , a two - parameter description , such as a sfr that is lognormal in time  with its double timescales of 0 and @xmath11 ( figures 9 and 10)seems to be the minimum required to reproduce the diversity of sfhs , found in our study of the csi survey data , for galaxies log @xmath101 912 and @xmath73 .",
    "our analysis of the csi survey data demonstrates that broad - wavelength coverage and accurate spectro - photometry can constrain the populations of stars formed over ` natural ' timescales of stellar evolution@xmath3 , and @xmath4 years .",
    "sfrs calculated from a sophisticated fitting of spectral energy distributions , based on well understood signatures of stellar populations , are able to discriminate galaxies that formed all their stars early  in a few billion years  from those that formed stars continuously , and from those that formed most of their stars late  after @xmath5 .",
    "we confirm predictions by o13 and modeling by g13 by identifying a substantial population of genuinely young galaxies  those that formed most of their stellar mass after @xmath5 and within 1 gyr of the epoch of observation .",
    "we demonstrate through duplicate measurements of galaxy stellar mass that a parameter _ z5fract_the fraction of total stellar mass that was formed in the epoch starting at @xmath24 and lasting @xmath65 gyr  is a simple but robust indicator of sfhs .",
    "we quantify the relative proportions of diverse sfhs through _",
    "z5fract _ and show that , at @xmath30 and log m@xmath102 , geniuinely young galaxies  those with greater stellar mass made in the final gyr than in the time prior  are @xmath650% of the population , and that  though they are rare  there are young galaxies with masses of the milky way , @xmath103 , and higher .",
    "the different forms of sfhs are functions of total mass , but there is large diversity at any given mass and , conversely , a wide range of mass ( @xmath61.0 dex ) over which a particular sfh can be found . assuming that stellar mass is strongly coupled to dark halo mass , this means that galaxies with the same halo mass at any given epoch can host very different sfhs .",
    "this suggests another parameter , in addition to halo _ mass _ , that controls when star formation begins and how it progresses .",
    "this could be a property of the halo , for example , its density or turn - around time , or of baryonic physics , such as star - formation or black hole growth feedback .",
    "these factors could drive the  efficiency \" of turning baryonic mass into stars that is offered as an explanation of why the halo mass function and the stellar mass function of galaxies do not ` track . '",
    "our sample is dominated by  field \" galaxies , which means isolated galaxies or those in moderate mass groups .",
    "the most massive galaxies , and those galaxies most exposed to ` environment effects , ' are not represented in the present study , because the csi survey includes no rich clusters .",
    "that being said , the sfhs we present account for @xmath695% of all galaxies with masses larger than 10@xmath1 .",
    "the conformal approach to sfhs explicitly includes  quenching mechanisms \" to alter the course of star formation , specifically , to stop it , but only a small fraction of our sample are good candidates for  mass quenching \" or `` environmental quenching , '' two popular generic concepts .",
    "nevertheless , a very large fraction of our 22,494 galaxy sample have evolved from sfrs of 10 s of  early in their lifetime to @xmath91  by the present epoch .",
    "our data therefore suggest that natural processes working on the timescale of a hubble time are able to regulate rising and then falling star formation without discrete , short - timescale quenching events .",
    "the picture that emerges is one of predestined paths for galaxies , perhaps modulated by mergers in their early history , with a `` clock '' and as - yet unidentified intrinsic processes that propel a galaxy_sooner , or later_to a state where halo gas is insufficient , or in a unusuable state , for continued star formation .",
    "these and other data support a picture where sfhs are generally locked - in at an early epoch , determined by specific properties of the environment or the galaxy itself . such built - in trajectories can provide an alternative explanation for supposedly environment - related correlations , like galaxy morphology with local density , or the satellite / central paradigm , as expressions of _ initial conditions_. dark matter halos must play a role in this process , but a simple correlation of sfh and halo mass is clearly incompatible with the diverse histories we present here .",
    "we look to theoretical work to explore halo and/or baryonic properties that are responsible for this manifold variety of sfhs .",
