    "this article is concerned with providing an example of asymptotically euclidean , conformally flat initial data sets for the einstein vacuum equations which are expected to have time developments for which the two disconnected parts of null infinity have different degrees of smoothness .",
    "the analysis of the behaviour of the gravitational field in the region of spacetime near spatial infinity and null infinity carried out in @xcite for spacetimes with time reflexion symmetry and in @xcite for spacetimes without time reflexion was motivated by the desire of setting on a sound footing _",
    "penrose s proposal _ for the description of the asymptotics of the gravitational field see",
    "e.g. @xcite .",
    "penrose s proposal suggests that the asymptotic gravitational field of isolated systems should admit a _",
    "smooth conformal completion _ at null infinity .",
    "a large class of spacetimes satisfying penrose s proposal has been constructed by chruciel & delay @xcite .",
    "the examples provided rely in a refinement of a gluing construction introduced by corvino @xcite by means of which it is possible to construct time symmetric initial data sets which are essentially arbitrary inside a compact set , but are exactly schwarzschild in the asymptotic region .",
    "more recently , a further development in the gluing techniques has allowed to extend corvino s results to the non - time symmetric case , so that initial data sets which are arbitrary in a compact region can be glued to a stationary asymptotic region @xcite . as a result ,",
    "all of the available examples of spacetimes satisfying penrose s proposal are stationary in a spacetime neighbourhood of spatial infinity . in view of this",
    ", it is natural to ask whether initial data sets with stationary asymptotic regions are the only ones giving rise to spacetimes with a smooth null infinity . in relation to this latter issue , evidence for the following conjecture",
    "has been provided @xcite :    the time development of an asymptotically euclidean initial data set which is conformally flat in a neighbourhood of infinity admits a conformal extension to both future and past null infinity of class @xmath0 , with @xmath1 a non - negative integer , if and only if the initial data are schwarzschild to order @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a non - negative integer .",
    "if the development admits an extension of class @xmath4 , then the initial data have to be exactly schwarzschild on @xmath5 .    here ,",
    "for _ schwarzschild up to order @xmath2 _ it is understood that asymptotic expansions of the initial data near infinity coincide up to order @xmath6 with those of initial data for the schwarzschild solution see section 2 for more details .",
    "a similar conjecture is expected to hold for non - conformally flat initial data so that the data should be stationary up to order @xmath2 if a null infinity of class @xmath0 is to be attained .",
    "the calculations leading to the conjecture have shown the possibility of having a spacetime where future null infinity ( @xmath7 ) and past null infinity ( @xmath8 ) have different smoothness note that the conjecture requires conditions on both parts of null infinity , in stark contrast with a previous version which arose in the analysis of time symmetric situations @xcite .",
    "the possibility of having a spacetime where the two components of null infinity have different degrees of differentiability arose for the first time in the post - newtonian analysis of the relativistic kepler problem carried out by walker & will @xcite .",
    "their calculations exhibit a system whose fall - off at null infinity is compatible with the _ peeling behaviour _ at @xmath7 , but not at @xmath8 .",
    "the latter phenomenon was regarded as a hint that requiring smoothness of the gravitational field at past null infinity may be a too stringent condition see e.g. @xcite .",
    "for many physical applications the presence of a non - smooth @xmath8 may not be too hampering as long as one can ensure a peeling @xmath7 . and",
    "even if @xmath7 happens to be non - smooth , most of the relevant structure at null infinity can still be recovered see @xcite . as pointed out by penrose : `` the issue is not whether regularity at @xmath7 covers all situations we would like to call _ asymptotically flat _ ; it is whether this regularity condition allows all the freedom that we need in order to describe isolated systems in general relativity '' see @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "scripts in the computer algebra system maple v were used to calculate asymptotic expansions of the time development of conformally flat ( but non - time symmetric ) initial data sets in a neighbourhood of spatial infinity . in particular , the components @xmath9 with @xmath10 , of the weyl spinor @xmath11 have an expansion of the form : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a geodesic distance , and the coefficients @xmath14 depend on @xmath15 , an affine parameter of conformal geodesics , and on some angular coordinates . in these coordinates",
    "@xmath16 corresponds to the locus of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "it turns out that for @xmath17 , the coefficients @xmath18 extend smoothly through null infinity .",
    "however , from @xmath19 onwards , one finds a series of _ obstructions _ to the smoothness of both future and past null infinity .",
    "for @xmath19 the obstructions are time symmetric that is , the obstructions for @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the same , but at @xmath20 some of the obstructions do not possess this time symmetry .",
    "the latter as it was discussed in previous paragraphs opened the possibility of having a future and a past null infinity with different degrees of smoothness .",
    "a similar phenomenon occurs , as it is to be expected , if one analyses time asymmetric initial data sets which are not conformally flat .",
    "however , the overall picture is much more involved .",
    "the calculations in @xcite assume the existence of initial data sets which are expandable in powers of @xmath21 near infinity .",
    "existence proofs for this type of data have been provided in @xcite . however , the question whether the free parameters in the solution can be chosen such that the conditions leading to smoothness - asymmetric null infinities are satisfied remained open .",
    "this article provides an answer to this question .",
    "ultimately , one would also like to make some assertion concerning the existence of the time development .",
    "this question is a much more difficult one and lies outside the scope of the present work .",
    "the article is structured as follows .",
    "section 2 is concerned with some aspects of conformally flat initial data sets which will be required in our investigations .",
    "in particular , some solutions to the momentum constraint more general than those of the bowen - york ansatz are considered , and a general existence result for the class of initial data under consideration is recalled . in section 3",
    "we discuss a certain class of obstructions to the smoothness of null infinity which allow us to construct initial data sets whose developments would have prescribed regularity at null infinity .",
    "section 4 contains our main result and its proof .",
    "the present work is a natural extension of the work carried out in @xcite .",
    "we have endeavour to follow to the nomenclature and notation of these references , however , for convenience we have made use of spin - weighted harmonics instead of certain unitary representations of @xmath22 when performing expansions .",
    "accordingly , our notation has been adapted .",
    "the reader in need of a remainder on concepts and results on functional analysis ( sobolev spaces , gteaux derivatives , the implicit function theorem ) is remitted to @xcite .",
    "we shall restrict our discussion to solutions @xmath23 to the vacuum einstein constraint equations : @xmath24 on asymptotically euclidean 3-manifolds , @xmath25 , which are _ maximal _ that is , @xmath26 and _ conformally flat_. the metric @xmath27 will be taken to be _ negative definite_. for simplicity , we shall also assume that the initial data sets are axially symmetric .",
    "nevertheless , it must be pointed out that our analysis can be generalised to the axially symmetric and/or conformally flat settings .",
    "furthermore , we shall assume that the 3-manifold @xmath25 has the topology of the time symmetric slice of the schwarzschild solution : two asymptotically flat regions connected by a `` throat see figure 1 ''",
    ".     corresponds to that of time symmetric slices of schwarzschild : two asymptotic regions connected by a `` throat''.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    the construction we want to implement depends crucially on the properties of the solutions to the constraints in a neighbourhood of infinity .",
    "therefore , we adopt the conformal compactification picture .",
    "let @xmath28 be a smooth , orientable , connected , compact 3-manifold for definiteness , we can think of @xmath29 . in @xmath28",
    "we shall consider two special points @xmath30 and @xmath31 say , the north and south poles of @xmath29 which will represent the two infinities of the asymptotic ends of the physical data @xmath32 , and so that @xmath33 .      following the standard approach _the conformal method_ we set @xmath34",
    "let @xmath35 denote @xmath36-normal coordinates centred at @xmath30 .",
    "when no confusion arises , we may write @xmath37 instead of @xmath35 . in order to ensure the asymptotic euclideanity of the initial data we require    @xmath38    with @xmath39",
    ". similarly , if @xmath40 denote @xmath36-normal coordinates centred at @xmath31 , we shall require that    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is a positive constant .",
    "because of the conformal flatness of the data , we set in a neighbourhood of @xmath30 , @xmath43 , so that near @xmath30 the constraint equations reduce to :    @xmath44    where @xmath45 denotes the flat laplacian .",
    "the solutions to the momentum constraint in euclidean space have been extensively studied in the literature see e.g. @xcite . for convenience , we will use the version given in @xcite , in which the solutions to the momentum constraint are derived using the space - spinor formalism see @xcite . for this , we consider the vector field @xmath46 which in cartesian coordinates is given by @xmath47 , and complete it to an orthonormal basis @xmath48 .",
    "let @xmath49 denote the components of the second fundamental form @xmath50 with respect to this basis . in a space - spinor formalism , and under the assumption of a maximal slice , the tensor @xmath50",
    "will be represented by means of a totally symmetric spinor @xmath51 which is related to @xmath52 via the spatial infeld - van der waerden symbols",
    "@xmath53 : @xmath54 the spinor @xmath51 being totally symmetric can be decomposed as @xmath55 where the spinors @xmath56 , @xmath57 are also totally symmetric and @xmath58 the subindex @xmath10 in @xmath59 indicating that @xmath60 of the indices have to be set equal to @xmath61 .",
    "the particular solution to the momentum constraint that we are going to consider can be split in six independent pieces : @xmath62 the term @xmath63 associated with the expansion conformal killing vector it gives rise , for example , to time asymmetric slices in schwarzschild @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath64 encodes the angular momentum content of the data . while the remaining terms are diverse multipolar terms the first superindex denotes the decay of the term ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 or @xmath67 ) and the second its multipolar nature : quadrupolar ( @xmath68 ) or octupolar ( @xmath69 ) . for further discussion see @xcite .    in the case of the @xmath63 term ,",
    "one has a single non - vanishing component : @xmath70 assuming axial symmetry , the non - vanishing components of @xmath64 are given by : @xmath71 for the remaining terms one has that : @xmath72 for @xmath10 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath73 and @xmath74 are freely specifiable complex numbers satisfying the reality condition @xmath75 the remaining coefficients are calculated via the formulae :    @xmath76    in addition , the following _ regularity conditions _ will be required to hold : @xmath77 the latter , together with ( [ reality ] ) that @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 are pure imaginary .",
    "the conditions ( [ regularity ] ) are intended to preclude the appearance of a certain type of logarithmic divergences at the sets where null infinity touches spatial infinity see @xcite , and also the discussion in section 3 .    from the point of view of",
    "the normal coordinates @xmath40 centred on @xmath31 , the different terms of @xmath51 have an analogous decay to the one near @xmath30 : @xmath82 thus , all the terms save for @xmath83 are singular at both @xmath30 and @xmath31 see @xcite .    for latter use , it is noted that if @xmath50 is of the form given by equation ( [ psi_ab ] ) then : @xmath84 note that the above expansion truncates at order @xmath85 , the first contributions of the higher multipolar terms in @xmath86 appearing at order @xmath87 .",
    "also , @xmath88 .",
    "finally , we note that for a neighbourhood @xmath89 of radius @xmath90 centred at @xmath30 , one has that @xmath91 where @xmath92 .",
    "similar behaviour is obtained on @xmath93 for @xmath94 .",
    "the assumption on the conformal flatness of the 3-metric @xmath27 and the choice of solutions to the momentum constraint made in the previous section fulfil the hypothesis of the existence results obtained in @xcite .",
    "thus , one has :    if @xmath27 is conformally flat , and @xmath95 is given via equation ( [ psi_ab ] ) , then there is a unique , positive solution @xmath96 to the licnerowicz equation ( [ cf_hamiltonian ] ) with the boundary conditions ( [ boundary_2 ] ) and ( [ boundary_4 ] ) .",
    "moreover , by virtue of ( [ eli_condition ] ) one has that on @xmath97 : @xmath98 where @xmath99 .",
    "because of @xmath99 , the function @xmath100 can be expanded in a neighbourhood of @xmath30 as : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the adm mass of the initial data , and @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 , @xmath108 are , respectively , monopolar , dipolar , quadrupolar and octupolar terms . in reference",
    "@xcite it has been shown that , without loss of generality , one can make use of the translational freedom in the setting to remove the dipolar term , @xmath104 , in the previous expansion .",
    "proceeding in such a way , we are left with @xmath109 the explicit calculations carried out in @xcite show that in fact @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "alternatively , one could have used the spherical coordinates associated with the normal coordinates @xmath35 . due to our assumption on axial symmetry",
    "the expansions are given by , @xmath112 , is used .",
    "here , instead , we make use of the more standard spin - weighted spherical harmonics @xmath113 .",
    "the relation between the two sets of functions is given by @xmath114 accordingly , we have slightly changed our notation with respect to that of @xcite . ] : @xmath115 where @xmath116 , and @xmath117 .    the function @xmath100 satisfies the elliptic equation : @xmath118 thus",
    ", the coefficients @xmath119 and @xmath120 are determined by the boundary conditions ( [ boundary_1])-([boundary_4 ] ) and the parameters of @xmath50 that is , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "thus , sometimes we shall write @xmath125(x)$ ] . the elliptic nature of ( [ yamabe ] ) reveals that @xmath100 contains information of global nature .",
    "the local part around infinity is encoded in the @xmath126 term of ( [ theta_local_p ] ) corresponding to the conformal flatness of the data .    from equation ( [ yamabe ] ) and taking into account the boundary conditions ( [ boundary_1])-([boundary_2 ] )",
    "one gets the integral representation : @xmath127 the function @xmath128 corresponds to the green s function of the laplacian on @xmath129 .    for later use , we show that the function @xmath125(x)$ ] depends at least in a @xmath130 fashion on the parameters @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 which determine the tensor @xmath50 .",
    "the solution @xmath100 of equation ( [ yamabe ] ) , with @xmath50 given by equation ( [ psi_ab ] ) is @xmath130 in the parameters @xmath121 , @xmath131 and @xmath123 , @xmath132    to see this , we rewrite equation ( [ yamabe ] ) as @xmath133 and concentrate on the dependence of @xmath100 with respect to @xmath122 the analysis with respect to the other parameters of @xmath50 is similar .",
    "the mapping @xmath134 , @xmath135 , where @xmath136 denotes the sobolev space of functions on @xmath28 with @xmath137-integrable weak second order derivatives , is at least a @xmath138 mapping ( in the @xmath137 norm ) between banach spaces actually , it can be shown to be @xmath4 , but @xmath138 will be enough for our applications . that @xmath139 can be shown using @xmath140 and noting that @xmath141 converges to @xmath142",
    "is @xmath100 goes to @xmath143 as @xmath144 is a banach space , and that @xmath145 is in our case analytic function of @xmath122 . to establish the @xmath130 character of the map @xmath146 one has to perform a similar discussion with the gteaux derivative of @xmath146 , @xmath147 , which is given by @xmath148 again",
    ", the analyticity of @xmath50 with respect to @xmath122 is crucial to establish the continuity of @xmath149 .",
    "higher order derivatives are dealt with in a similar fashion .",
    "now , let us consider a solution @xmath143 to equation ( [ yamabe ] ) , corresponding to a certain value , @xmath150 , of the angular momentum , so that @xmath151 the existence of such a solution is guaranteed by the theorem 1 .",
    "the linearised operator @xmath152 @xmath153 is an isomorphism : due to @xmath154 the only solution to @xmath155 is @xmath156 ( seen using integration by parts ) ; further , @xmath157 is selfadjoint and , thus , using the fredholm alternative it is also surjective see eg .",

    "note that if one only had @xmath171 then the pointwise continuity with respect to @xmath122 of @xmath172 can not be concluded .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the calculations carried out in @xcite provide asymptotic expansions for the components of the weyl spinor which allow to relate the structure of the initial data with the radiative properties of the development . here , and in what follows we will concentrate our attention on the null infinity associated with the asymptotic end @xmath30 . what happens at the null infinity assigned to the second asymptotic end , @xmath31 , will not be of relevance for our purposes . assuming axial symmetry , the components of the weyl tensor can be written as : @xmath173 where @xmath10 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath174 for @xmath17 are _ polynomial _ in @xmath15 .    for @xmath19 , they are polynomial in @xmath15 for @xmath175 .",

    "similarly , for @xmath20 the coefficients @xmath174 are polynomial for @xmath183 , while the coefficients of the @xmath176 harmonics are of the form @xmath184 where again @xmath178 , @xmath179 and @xmath180 are some polynomials in @xmath15 , @xmath181 , @xmath182 different to those in equation ( [ alpha_52k ] ) .",
    "finally , @xmath185 the coefficients @xmath186 for @xmath187 are expected to exhibit a similar pattern . in particular , it is conjectured that there is an infinite hierarchy of coefficients @xmath188 associated with logarithmic terms of the form discussed above .",
    "these details will not be relevant for our analysis .",
    "the coefficients @xmath189 , @xmath190 and @xmath191 _the obstructions to the smoothness of null infinity_ are given in terms of the freely specifiable data by : @xmath192 where in order to render the above expressions more readable we have set    @xmath193    in accordance with the reality conditions ( [ reality ] ) and the regularity conditions ( [ regularity ] ) .    the role of the obstructions ( [ upsilon522])-([upsilon633 ] )",
    "can be better understood by noting that the conformal factor @xmath194 rendering the representation of the region of spacetime near null and spatial infinity in which the components of the weyl tensor ( [ phi_j ] ) are calculated is of the form , @xmath195 where @xmath196 . the locus of null infinity is given by @xmath197 .",
    "in addition , we define @xmath198 and @xmath199 corresponding , respectively , to the _ cylinder at spatial infinity _ and the _ critical sets _ where null infinity `` touches '' spatial infinity .",
    "thus , the coefficients @xmath186 in the expansion ( [ phi_j ] ) , considered as functions on @xmath200 diverge on the critical sets @xmath201 if the relevant obstructions are not satisfied .",

    "given @xmath216 , @xmath217 and a conformally flat initial data set with second fundamental form given by ( [ psi_ab ] ) and satisfying the boundary conditions ( [ boundary_2 ] ) and ( [ boundary_4 ] ) , there exists a neighbourhood @xmath218 , @xmath219 such that if @xmath220 , then there are unique @xmath221 , @xmath222 , @xmath223 , @xmath224 , @xmath225 with @xmath226 , @xmath227 , such that @xmath228 the condition @xmath229 is satisfied if @xmath230 , @xmath231 , @xmath232 .",
    "thus , given a particular time asymmetric , conformally flat schwarzschild initial data set , there is always a ( non - linear ) perturbation of it actually an open set of them satisfying the conditions ( [ cond_1 ] ) and ( [ cond_2 ] ) .",
    "note that these perturbations have necessarily non - vanishing angular momentum ; furthermore , from a careful analysis of the proof it stems that all the parameters of the second fundamental form have to be non - zero justifying the somewhat complicated - looking choice of the extrinsic curvature made in 2.2 .",
    "the different parts of the proof will be discussed in the sequel .",
    "our first task is to obtain some expressions which enable us to control the expansion coefficients in ( [ w_spherical ] ) .",
    "the explicit calculations of @xcite show that : @xmath233 in @xmath97 , where    @xmath234    on the other hand , the coefficients @xmath214 and @xmath215 do not admit such closed and neat expressions .",
    "they contain information of global nature .",
    "thus , in order to control them we have to resort to the integral representation ( [ integral_w ] ) .",
    "we begin by noting that : @xmath235 in order to differentiate the integral representation ( [ integral_w ] ) we have to proceed with care , for the green function @xmath236 is singular if @xmath237 .",

    "similarly , one finds that @xmath251      in order to see how the conditions ( [ cond_1 ] ) and ( [ cond_2 ] ) can be satisfied , we begin by considering imaginary parts of the obstructions ( [ upsilon522])-([upsilon633 ] ) :    @xmath252    the condition ( [ im_upsilon520 ] ) can be used to solve for @xmath208 in terms of @xmath210 and @xmath213 .",

    "satisfying @xmath255 and @xmath256 is much more subtle . for this",
    "we turn to the integral representations ( [ omega_220 ] ) and ( [ omega_330 ] ) of the coefficients @xmath214 and @xmath215 of @xmath100 .",

    "more crucially for our purposes , if @xmath261 , but we keep @xmath262 , then the initial data corresponds to a conformally flat , time asymmetric slice in the schwarzschild spacetime , and see @xcite @xmath263 the latter fact suggests the use of an `` implicit function theorem''-type of argument to see if there are some values of @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath209 and @xmath210 such that ( [ integral_1 ] ) and ( [ integral_2 ] ) hold .    given that the choice @xmath261 , @xmath262 corresponds to schwarzschild data , we have that    @xmath264=0 ,   \\label{u5_0}\\\\ & & \\mbox{re}(\\upsilon_{6;3})[\\mathcal{a}_0,0,0,0]=0 ;   \\label{u6_0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the smoothness of of static spacetimes at the critical sets where null infinity `` touches '' spatial infinity has been discussed in @xcite . on the other hand , using lemma 1 ,",
    "@xmath265 and @xmath266 depend in , at least , @xmath130 fashion on @xmath121 . from ( [ psipsi ] ) and ( [ w_a ] ) it follows that    @xmath267\\neq0 , \\\\ & & \\partial_\\mathcal{a } \\mbox{re}(\\upsilon_{6;3})[\\mathcal{a}_0,0,0,0]\\neq0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus , if we set @xmath268 \\bigg)^2 + \\bigg(\\mbox{re}(\\upsilon_{6;3})[\\mathcal{a},\\mathcal{j},\\beta_r,\\beta_i]\\bigg)^2,\\ ] ] one has that    @xmath269    so that from the implicit function theorem see e.g. @xcite there exists a neighbourhood @xmath270 , @xmath271 and a @xmath130 function @xmath272 , @xmath226 such that @xmath273 the latter proves essentially proves our main result .",

    "the initial data we have constructed in this article is a non - linear perturbation of time asymmetric schwarzschild initial data .",
    "it is conformally flat and has non - vanishing angular momentum .",
    "its time development should give rise to a radiative spacetime which could be interpreted as a distorted schwarzschild black hole .",
    "the crucial remaining problem is to obtain an existence proof for the evolution equations which is valid up to ( and beyond ) the critical sets where null infinity `` touches '' spatial infinity see the discussions in @xcite .",
