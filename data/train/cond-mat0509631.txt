    "the efficient modeling of the long length- and time - scale dynamics of complex liquids such as colloidal and polymeric suspensions requires a simplified , coarse - grained description of the solvent degrees of freedom .",
    "a recently introduced particle - based simulation technique @xcite  often called stochastic rotation dynamics ( srd ) @xcite or multi - particle collision dynamics @xcite  is a very promising algorithm for mesoscale simulations of this type . in additional to its numerical advantages , the algorithm enables simulations in the microcanonical ensemble , and fully incorporates both thermal fluctuations and hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "furthermore , its simplicity has made it possible to obtain analytic expressions for the transport coefficients which are valid for both large and small mean free paths , something that is often very difficult to do for other mesoscale particle - based algorithms.this algorithm is particularly well suited for studying phenomena with reynolds and peclet numbers of order one , and it has been used to study the behavior of polymers @xcite , colloids @xcite , vesicles in shear flow @xcite , and complex fluids @xcite .",
    "the original srd algorithm models a fluid with an ideal gas equation of state .",
    "the fluid is therefore very compressible , and the speed of sound , @xmath0 , is low . in order to have negligible compressibility effects , as in real liquids , the mach number has to be kept small , which means that there are limits on the flow velocity in the simulation .",
    "it is therefore important to explore ways to extend the algorithm to model dense fluids .",
    "our approach starts from what has been a common theme of most liquid theories , namely the separation of intermolecular forces into short- and long - range parts , which are then treated differently .",
    "the short - range component is a strong repulsion when molecules are close together ; it leads to excluded volume effects which cause a decrease in the fluid s compressibility and eventual crystallization at low temperatures or high density . the long - range component is a weak attraction which can lead to a liquid - gas transition .",
    "the generic reference system for the short - range repulsive component of the force is the hard sphere system . in this letter",
    "we show how the srd the algorithm can be modified to model excluded volume effects , allowing for a more realistic modeling of dense gases and liquids .",
    "this is done in a thermodynamically consistent way by introducing generalized excluded volume interactions between the fluid particles .",
    "the algorithm can be thought of as a coarse - grained multi - particle collision generalization of a hard sphere fluid , since , just as for hard spheres , there is no internal energy . in order to simplify the analysis of the equation of state and the transport coefficients , and",
    "enhance computational efficiency , the cell structure of the original srd algorithm is retained .",
    "this work is a first step towards developing consistent particle - based algorithms for modeling , in the microcanonical ensemble , more general liquids with additional attractive interactions and a liquid - gas phase transition .",
    "as in the original srd algorithm , the solvent is modeled by a large number @xmath1 of point - like particles of mass @xmath2 which move in continuous space with a continuous distribution of velocities .",
    "the system is coarse - grained into @xmath3 cells of a @xmath4-dimensional cubic lattice of linear dimension @xmath5 and lattice constant @xmath6 .",
    "the algorithm consists of individual streaming and collision steps . in the free - steaming step ,",
    "the coordinates , @xmath7 , of the solvent particles at time @xmath8 are updated according to @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the velocity of particle @xmath11 at time @xmath8 and @xmath12 is the value of the discretized time step . in order to define the collision , we introduce a second grid with sides of length @xmath13 which ( in @xmath14 ) groups four adjacent cells into one `` supercell '' .    as discussed in refs . @xcite and @xcite , a random shift of the particle coordinates before the collision step is required to ensure galilean invariance .",
    "all particles are therefore shifted by the _",
    "same _ random vector with components in the interval @xmath15 $ ] before the collision step ( because of the supercell structure , this is a larger interval than in the conventional srd algorithm ) .",
    "particles are then shifted back by the same amount after the collision . to initiate a collision , pairs of cells in every supercell",
    "are randomly selected . as shown in fig . 1 , three different choices are possible : a ) horizontal ( with @xmath16 ) , b ) vertical ( @xmath17 ) , and c ) diagonal collisions ( with @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) .",
    "note that diagonal collisions are essential to equilibrate the kinetic energies in the @xmath20 and @xmath21directions .",
    "in every cell , we define the mean particle velocity , @xmath22 where the sum runs over all particles , @xmath23 , in the cell with index @xmath24 .",
    "the projection of the difference of the mean velocities of the selected cell - pairs on @xmath25 , @xmath26 , is then used to determine the probability of collision .",
    "if @xmath27 , no collision will be performed . for positive @xmath28 , a collision will occur with an acceptance probability which depends on @xmath28 and the number of particles in the two cells , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "this rule mimics a hard - sphere collision on a coarse - grained level : for @xmath31 clouds of particles collide and exchange momenta . for reasons discussed in the following",
    ", we have used the acceptance probability @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the unit step function and @xmath34 is a parameter which allows us to tune the equation of state . the hyperbolic tangent function was chosen in ( [ nonid0 ] ) in order to obtain a probability which varies smoothly between 0 and 1 .    once it is decided to perform a collision , an explicit form for the momentum transfer between the two cells",
    "is needed .",
    "the collision should conserve the total momentum and kinetic energy of the cell - pairs participating in the collision , and in analogy to the hard - sphere liquid , the collision should primarily transfer the component of the momentum which is parallel to the connecting vector @xmath35 . in the following , this component will be called the parallel or longitudinal momentum .",
    "there are many different rules which fullfill these conditions .",
    "our goal here is to obtain a large speed of sound .",
    "we therefore use a collision rule which leads to the maximum transfer of the parallel component of the momentum and does not change the transverse momentum .",
    "the rule is quite simple ; it exchanges the parallel component of the mean velocities of the two cells , which is equivalent to a `` reflection '' of the relative velocities , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the parallel component of the mean velocity of the particles of _ both _ cells .",
    "the perpendicular component remains unchanged , @xmath38 it is easy to verify that these rules conserve momentum and energy in the cell pairs .    because of @xmath39 symmetry , the probabilities for choosing cell pairs in the @xmath20 and @xmath21 directions ( with unit vectors @xmath40 and @xmath41 in fig .",
    "1 ) are equal , and will be denoted by @xmath42 . the probability for choosing diagonal pairs ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 in fig .",
    "1 ) is given by @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath42 and @xmath46 must be chosen to that the hydrodynamic equations are isotropic and do not depend on the orientation of the underlying grid .",
    "this can be done by considering the temporal evolution of the lowest moments of the velocity distribution function .",
    "it is sufficient to consider the following three moments for a single particle @xmath11 , @xmath47 assuming molecular chaos , the collision rules can be used to determine the eigenvalues of the relaxation matrix , @xmath48 , defined by @xmath49 .    because of the conservation of energy , one of the three eigenvalues of @xmath48 is equal to one ;",
    "the other two are given by @xmath50 and @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the average number of particles per cell .",
    "isotropy requires that @xmath53 , a condition that can be fullfiled for arbitrary @xmath52 only if @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "simulations show that both the speed of sound and the shear viscosity are isotropic for this choice .",
    "note , however , that this does not guarantee that all properties of the model are isotropic .",
    "this becomes apparent at high densities or high collision frequency , @xmath56 , where inhomogenuous states with cubic or rectangular order can be observed ( see fig .",
    "4 and accompanying discussion ) .",
    "the transport coefficients can be determined using the same green - kubo formalism as was used for the original srd algorithm @xcite .",
    "in particular , the kinematic shear viscosity is given by @xmath57 where @xmath58\\tau)/2]\\right)\\ ] ] is the off - diagonal element of the stress tensor @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath60 and @xmath61 are the cell coordinates of particle @xmath62 in the fixed and _ shifted _ frames at time @xmath8 , respectively , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .",

    ", for collisions characterized by @xmath40 , @xmath69 if @xmath70 in ( [ bcor1 ] ) is one of the two cells on the left of a supercell and @xmath71 if @xmath70 is on the right hand side of a supercell ; all other components of @xmath72 are zero . in general , the components of @xmath66 are either @xmath73 , @xmath74 , or @xmath75 . using @xmath76 , the collision invariants of the model can be written as @xmath77=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath78 for the density , @xmath79 are components of the particle momentum , and @xmath80 is the kinetic energy of particle j @xcite . the analogous collision invariants for the standard srd algorithm are given in eq .",
    "( 25 ) of @xcite .",
    "the vectors @xmath72 are constructed so that the sum of the two exponentials in ( [ cons ] ) is the same for two particles if and only if they are in partner cells in a collision with index @xmath67 ( see fig .",
    "the self - diffusion constant @xmath81 is given by a sum over the velocity - autocorrelation function ( see , e.g. eq . ( 102 ) in @xcite ) and can be evaluated analytically assuming molecular chaos . due to the excluded volume interactions",
    ", density fluctuations are supressed in the current algorithm ; ignoring these fluctuations , one finds @xmath82 which is in good agreement with simulation data , see fig .",
    "the collision rules conserve the kinetic energy , so that the internal energy of our system should be the same as that of an ideal gas .",
    "thermodynamic consistency requires that the non - ideal contribution to the pressure is linear in @xmath83 .",
    "as will be shown , this is possible if the coefficient @xmath34 in ( [ nonid0 ] ) is chosen small enough ( see fig .",
    "we use here the mechanical definition of pressure  the average longitudinal momentum transfer across a fixed interface per unit time and unit surface area  to determine the equation of state .",
    "we consider only the momentum transfer due to collisions , since that coming from streaming constitutes the ideal part of the pressure .",
    "take an interface that is parallel to the @xmath21axis and consider the component @xmath84 of the pressure tensor .",
    "only collisions with label @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 of the collision vector @xmath68 in fig .",
    "1 contribute to the momentum transfer in this case .",
    "consider the contribution to the momentum transfer across the cell boundary from collisions with @xmath85 .",
    "for fixed number of particles , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , in the two cells , the thermal average of the momentum transfer , @xmath88 , across the dividing line is @xmath89 the factor @xmath90 comes from the position average of the dividing line , since the collision occurs n the shifted cells , and the integral is restricted to positive @xmath28 because the acceptance rate is zero for @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath91 is the probability that @xmath92 for the micro - state of two cells is equal to @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath55 is the probability of selecting this collision .    expanding the acceptance probability , eq .",
    "( [ nonid0 ] ) , in @xmath93 leads to + @xmath94 .",
    "the contributions to the pressure from all terms of this series can be calculated , but since the resulting contribution to the pressure from a term proportional to @xmath95 is of order @xmath96 , we restrict ourselves to the first term .",
    "the resulting contribution to the pressure , @xmath97 , for fixed @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the average momentum transfer per unit area and unit time , so that using eqs .",
    "( [ press3 ] ) , we have @xmath98 .",
    "a similar calculation can be performed for the contributions from the diagonal collisions , which occur with the probability @xmath46 . using @xmath55 and @xmath54 and averaging over the number of particles per cell ( assuming that they are poisson - distributed and that the particle number distributions in adjacent cells are not correlated ) , one finds the non - ideal part of the pressure , @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the ideal gas contribution to the pressure ( in @xmath14 ) .",
    "note that the same result is obtained if , instead of averaging over @xmath29 and @xmath30 , we simply set @xmath101 , the average number of particles per cell .",
    "@xmath102 is quadratic in the particle density , @xmath103 , as one would expect from a virial expansion .",
    "the prefactor @xmath34 must be chosen small enough that higher order terms in this expansion are negligible .",
    "we have found that prefactors @xmath34 leading to acceptance rates of about @xmath104 are sufficiently small to guarantee that the pressure is linear in @xmath83 ( see fig .",
    "in order to measure @xmath102 , we have used the fact that the average of the diagonal part of the microscopic stress tensor gives the virial expression for the pressure @xmath105 \\right\\ } \\right\\rangle .\\ ] ] the first term , @xmath106 , gives @xmath107 , as discussed in ref .",
    "the average over the second term vanishes ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , while the average of the third term is the non - ideal part of the pressure , @xmath102 .",
    "simulation results for @xmath102 obtained using ( [ virial ] ) are in good agreement with the analytical expression , ( [ press_mav ] ) ( see fig .",
    "[ press_fig ] ) .",
    "in addition , measurements of the density fluctuations , @xmath108 , at small wave vectors @xmath109 , as well as results for the adiabatic speed of sound obtained from simulations of the dynamic structure factor , are both in good agreement with the predictions following from eq .",
    "( [ press_mav ] ) .",
    "these results provide strong evidence for the thermodynamic consistency of the model .",
    "if the non - ideal part of the pressure is large compared to the ideal pressure , ordering effects can be expected . for small @xmath34 , both contributions to the pressure are proportional to the temperature , so that just as in a real hard - sphere fluid , changing the temperature does not lead to an order / disorder transition . on the other hand ,",
    "the two contributions to the pressure have different dependencies on the density and time step , @xmath12 .",
    "in fact , @xmath12 can be interpreted as a parameter describing the efficiency of the collisions ; lowering @xmath12 results in a higher collision frequency , and has a similar effect to making the spheres larger in a real hard - sphere system .",
    "we therefore expect caging and ordering effect if either @xmath110 is increased or @xmath12 is decreased .",
    "this is indeed the case . for @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 ,",
    "an ordered cubic state is observed . the cubic symmetry of the ordered state is clearly an artifact of the cubic cell structure , and it would be interesting to see if this could be removed by using an hexagonal cell structure or incorporating random rotations of the grid .",
    "one of the surprising features of this crystalline - like state is , that @xmath39 symmetry can be broken .",
    "furthermore , there is the possibility of having several metastable crystalline states corresponding to slightly different lattice constants and number of particles per `` cloud '' .",
    "as expected , the lattice constants of these ordered states are slightly smaller than the super - cell spacing , @xmath13 , which sets the range of the multi - particle interaction . in this state , the diffusion coefficient becomes very small ; particles are caged and can barely leave their location .    to understand this behavior , note that without collisions , particle clouds will broaden due to streaming ;",
    "this will happen faster the higher the temperature .",
    "due to the grid shift , particles at the perimeter of the clouds will more often undergo collisions with neighbor clouds .",
    "these collisions backscatter the particles , forcing them to fly back towards the center of their cloud .",
    "there is a correlation between the distance from cloud center and rate at which it is backscattered , leading to stable cloud formation",
    ". a particle which is left alone between clouds will feel repulsion from all clouds and moves around very quickly until it is absorbed into a cloud .",
    "the model presented in this letter is the first extension of the srd algorithm to model fluids with a non - ideal equation of state .",
    "it was shown that the model is thermodynamically consistent for the correct choice of acceptance probabilities and reproduces the correct isotropic hydrodynamic equations at large length scales .",
    "expressions for the equation of state and the self - diffusion constant were derived and shown to be in good agreement with numerical results .",
    "simulation results for the kinematic viscosity were presented , and it was shown that there is an ordered state for large densities and collision frequencies . a detailed analysis of the transport coefficients will be presented elsewhere .",
