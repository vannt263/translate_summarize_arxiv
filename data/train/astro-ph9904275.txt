    "four main sequence stars harbor doppler companions that have @xmath0= 1575 m@xmath1 , which may represent the `` brown dwarfs '' ( mayor et al .",
    "1998 , mayor et al . 1997 ) .",
    "indeed the companions to 70 vir ( @xmath0= 6.8 m@xmath1 ) and to hd114762 ( @xmath0= 11 m@xmath1 ) may also represent `` brown dwarfs '' ( marcy & butler 1996 , mazeh et al .",
    "1997 , latham et al .",
    "1989 , boss 1997 ) .",
    "the distinction between `` planets '' and `` brown dwarfs '' remains cloudy and rests on two formation scenarios .",
    "planets form out of the agglomeration of condensible material in a disk into a rock  ice core ( eg . lissauer 1995 ) .",
    "in contrast , brown dwarfs presumably form by a gravitational instability in gas ( eg . boss 1998 , burrows et al .",
    "hybrid formation scenarios remain viable in which the relative importance of solid core growth and gas accretion within a disk lead to a continuum in internal structure .",
    "subsequent collisions may lead to further growth and dynamical evolution .",
    "the current dichotomous taxonomy may describe substellar physics no more precisely than `` spiral '' and `` elliptical '' summarize galactic physics .    the first incontrovertible sub ",
    "classification within the substellar regime is revealed in the mass distribution .",
    "companions having @xmath0 in the decade between 0.55 m@xmath1outnumber those between 550 m@xmath1by a factor of @xmath83 ( eg , marcy & butler 1998 , mayor et al .",
    "the poor detectability of the lowest  mass companions implies that the factor of 3 is a lower  limit to the cosmic ratio .",
    "this plentitude of companions having jovian masses suggests that qualitatively distinct formation processes predominated , arguably similar to those associated with the giant planets in our solar system ( lin et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the extrasolar planets reveal some peculiarities that may bear on their formation .",
    "the host stars of the extrasolar planet candidates have higher mean metallicity by a factor of @xmath82 in abundance compared with field stars ( gonzalez 1998 ) .",
    "metallicity was not a criterion in the selection of the target stars for these planet searches .",
    "equally interesting is that seven planets reside in orbits with a radius less than 0.12 au , sometimes termed `` 51 peg '' planets ( mayor & queloz 1995 , butler et al . 1998 ) .",
    "precision doppler surveys are most sensitive to planets in small orbits , resulting in a selection effect . nonetheless , these small orbits challenge us to explain their existence in a region where both the high temperatures and the small amount of protostellar material would inhibit formation _ in situ_. the 51 peg planets thus offer support for the prediction by goldreich & tremaine ( 1980 ) and lin ( 1986 ) that jupiters may migrate inward from farther out ( lin et al .",
    "1995 , ward 1997 , trilling et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "perhaps most intriguing about the planet candidates are the orbital eccentricities .",
    "the orbits of the 51 peg planets may suffer some tidal circularization ( lin et al .",
    "1998 , terquem et al.1998 , ford et al .",
    "1998 , marcy et al . 1997 ) , and indeed their orbits are all nearly circular ( see table 4 ) . in contrast , the planets that orbit farther than 0.15 au from their star all reside in non ",
    "circular orbits having @xmath90.1 , i.e. more eccentric than for jupiter ( @xmath2=0.05 ) . indeed , all but two have @xmath90.2 .",
    "this high occurrence of orbital eccentricity has lead to a variety of models in which jupiter  like planets suffer gravitational interactions with a ) other planets ( weidenschilling & marzari 1996 , rasio & ford 1996 , lin & ida 1996 , levison et al . 1998 ) , b ) the disk ( artymowicz 1993 ) , c ) a companion star ( holman et al .",
    "1996 , mazeh et al .",
    "1997 ) , and d ) passing stars in the young cluster ( de la fuente marcos and de la fuente marcos 1997 , laughlin and adams 1998 ) .",
    "the possibility persists that the observed non ",
    "circular orbits all stem from perturbations from a bound companion star , as proposed for 16 cyg b ( holman et al . 1997 , mazeh et al 1997 ) , rather than from intrinsic dynamics of planet formation .",
    "this paper reports the detection of two new planetary candidates orbiting at 0.3 and 1.1 au , both having large eccentricities .",
    "the observations and orbital solutions are reported in section 2 .",
    "the search for stellar companions is discussed in section 3 .",
    "section 4 contains a discussion of the implications for planet formation .",
    "the two stars described here are among 430 g , k , and m - type main sequence stars currently being monitored at the keck i telescope for doppler variations .",
    "hd210277 has an effective temperature of 5570 @xmath1050 k , the average determination from spectral synthesis of high  resolution spectra ( favata et al . 1997 , fuhrmann 1998 , gonzalez et al . 1998 ) , which also yields a surface gravity of log @xmath11 = 4.38 @xmath10 0.1 ( fuhrmann 1998 , gonzalez et al . 1998 ) .",
    "these surface values imply main  sequence status and correspond to spectral type g7v ( gray 1997 ) .",
    "the metallicity of hd210277 is measured to be [ fe / h ] = + 0.24 @xmath100.02 , considerably higher than the average value for field stars , @xmath4[fe / h]@xmath12 = 0.23 , in the solar neighborhood ( gonzalez et al .",
    "1998 , favata et al .",
    "1997 , fuhrmann 1998 ) .",
    "thus , hd210277 appears to be rich by a factor of 3 in its abundance of heavy elements , normalized to hydrogen , placing its metallicity within the upper 5% of nearby stars .",
    "we measure a radial velocity of 21.1 @xmath10 2 , which agrees with that of duquennoy and mayor ( 1991 ) , 21.44 .",
    "its parallax of 0.047 arcsec ( perryman et al . 1997 ) implies an absolute visual magnitude of m@xmath13=4.90@xmath100.05 and a luminosity , @xmath14=0.93 l@xmath15 .",
    "these stellar parameters permit placement of hd210277 on evolutionary tracks , which yield a mass , @xmath16=0.92 @xmath10 0.02 m@xmath15and an age of 12 @xmath102 gyr ( gonzalez et al . 1998 ) .",
    "one stellar characteristic that bears on the doppler detectability of planets is the magnetic field and chromosphere .",
    "spots on a rotating star can produce spurious doppler shifts , and chromospheric emission correlates with spurious doppler `` noise '' presumably caused by surface magnetohydrodynamics ( saar et al .",
    "our spectra contain the chromospheric h&k emission lines from which stellar rotation and stellar age can be estimated ( noyes et al .",
    "this emission yields the chromospheric index known as the `` mt wilson s value '' of @xmath17 = 0.155 , implying @xmath18(hk)=-5.06 , measured from 36 spectra obtained from 1996.5 through 1998.7 ( shirts & marcy 1998 ) . see baliunas et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for a detailed discussion of the @xmath17 value .",
    "no trend or periodicity are apparent in the s values of hd210277 , and the rms is 0.006 , all of which indicate that hd210277 is chromospherically quiet .",
    "the implied rotation period is , @xmath19=40.8 d and the age is 6.9 gyr . in conjunction with the aforementioned age of 12 gyr from tracks , we conclude that hd210277 has an age in the range 710 gyr , but not evolved into the subgiant regime",
    ". such a chromospherically inactive star may produce spurious doppler shifts of no more than @xmath83 ( saar et al .",
    "1998 , butler et al . 1998 ) .",
    "no detailed lte analysis of hd168443 has been carried out to our knowledge .",
    "a photometric analysis was done by carney et al .",
    "( 1994 ) giving t@xmath20= 5430 and @xmath21=0.14 .",
    "the metallicity is apparently slightly subsolar , similar to the mean for nearby field stars .",
    "its parallax of 26.4 mas ( perryman et al .",
    "1997 ) implies an absolute visual magnitude of m@xmath13=4.03@xmath100.07 and a luminosity , @xmath14=2.1 l@xmath15 , which places it @xmath81.5 mag above the main sequence at its t@xmath20 .",
    "these stellar parameters suggest a subgiant status and spectral type , g8iv . apparently , hd168443 is similar to 70 vir in mass , surface characteristics , and metallicity ( marcy & butler 1996 , apps 1998 ) .",
    "our spectra of hd168443 yield a chromospheric s value of @xmath17 = 0.147 , with an rms of 0.009 during 30 observations from 19961998.5 , implying @xmath18(hk)=-5.08 .",
    "no trend or periodicity are apparent in the s values .",
    "the implied rotation period is @xmath22=37 d , and the implied age is 7.8 gyr , from the calibration by noyes et al .",
    "( 1984 ) . in conjunction with its possible subgiant status from above , we conclude that hd168443 has an age of 710 gyr , slightly evolved toward subgiant status .",
    "we caution that the subgiant status remains in question , pending spectroscopic assessment of surface gravity .",
    "a mass determination for hd168443 is given by carney et al .",
    "( 1994 ) who find @xmath16=0.84 m@xmath15 .",
    "this mass determination may warrant revision because it preceded the hipparcos parallax and because it did not include revisions to the metallicity dependence of evolutionary tracks ( bertelli et al .",
    "based on the hipparcos data and new tracks , along with available narrow  band photometry for hd168443 , apps ( 1998 ) estimates a mass of 1.05 @xmath100.10 m@xmath15for hd168443 .",
    "we adopt here the straight average of the two mass estimates to yield @xmath16 = 0.945 @xmath100.1 m@xmath15 .",
    "we measure a radial velocity of 49.0 @xmath10 2 ( on 1998 aug ) , which along with its high transverse velocity of 44 , suggests a kinematic association with the old disk population .",
    "such an old , chromospherically inactive star may produce spurious doppler shifts @xmath83 of photospheric origin ( saar et al .",
    "1998 , butler et al . 1998 ) .      for both hd210277 and hd168443 ,",
    "spectra were obtained from 1996.5 through 1998.7 with the hires echelle spectrometer on the keck i telescope ( vogt et al .",
    "we used slit `` b1 '' that has a width of 0.57 arcsec and height of 3.5 arcsec .",
    "the resolution for these spectra was @xmath18=87000 , based on the measured fwhm of the spectrometer instrumental profile .",
    "the spectra span wavelengths from 39006200  . the wavelength scale and instrumental profile were determined for each 2 chunk of spectrum for each exposure by using iodine absorption lines superimposed on the stellar spectrum ( butler et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the measured velocities are relative , with an arbitrary zero  point .",
    "the typical exposure times were @xmath85 minutes , depending on seeing , for both stars , yielding a s / n=300 per pixel ( 1/2 of one resolution element ) .",
    "such spectra are expected to carry photon ",
    "limited doppler precision of 23 ( butler et al . 1996 ) .",
    "indeed , the uncertainty in the mean velocity of the 400 spectral chunks is typically 2.5 .",
    "however , our results from 430 stars on the survey reveal a median rms velocity of 6 , which we interpret as the actual scatter that limits planet detection",
    ". intrinsic photospheric noise of @xmath83 accounts for some of the 6 scatter ( saar et al .",
    "this intrinsic stellar effect may be added in quadrature to the photon  limited errors of 2.5 to establish an expected doppler scatter of 3.9 .",
    "thus , we infer that unidentified errors of @xmath84 persist in our doppler results which presumably stem from inadequacies in our spectral modelling , improvements to which are in progress .",
    "the 34 measured velocities of hd210277 are listed in table 1 along with the jd date .",
    "again , the true uncertainty of each measurement is @xmath86 .",
    "a plot of the velocities for hd210277 is shown in figure 1 .",
    "it is apparent that the velocities for hd210277 scatter with a peak  to  peak variation of @xmath880 , and the velocities are correlated in time .",
    "a periodogram analysis revealed no significant peak because too few cycles have transpired during the two years of observations and because a lomb - scargle periodogram is not robust for non - sinusoidal variations which result from eccentric orbits .",
    "a suggestive period of 1.2 yr is evident in the velocities for hd210277 , though less than two periods have transpired .",
    "fit keplerian model yields an orbital period of 437@xmath1025 d , a semi - amplitude @xmath23 = 41.0@xmath105 , and an eccentricity @xmath2 = 0.45@xmath100.08 .",
    "the complete set of orbital parameters are given in table 3 .",
    "the rms to the keplerian fit is 7.1 , similar to the uncertainty and similar to the velocity rms , 7.6 , for the orbital fit to a previously - discovered keck survey planet hd187123 ( butler et al . 1998 ) .",
    "thus , the rms of 7 for hd210277 implies that a single companion provides a model that plausibly explains the velocities .    using the stellar mass of 0.92 m@xmath15 , the companion mass is constrained as , @xmath0= 1.28 m@xmath1 , and",
    "the semimajor axis is @xmath3 = 1.10 au . with periastron and apastron distances of 0.61 and 1.60 au , hd210277 is unlikely to harbor additional companions within that range .",
    "the 30 velocity measurements for hd168443 are listed in table 2 along with the jd date . as with hd210277 ,",
    "the true uncertainty of each measurement is @xmath86 .",
    "a plot of the velocities for hd168443 is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the velocities for hd168443 scatter with a peak  to  peak variation of 650 , with clear temporal correlations and trends among measurements .",
    "a periodogram reveals two dominant peaks , at @xmath24=20 d and @xmath2555 d.    we carried out nonlinear least  squares fits of keplerian models to the velocities , starting with trial periods ranging from 3  600 d. for trial periods near 20 d , the lowest velocity rms was 69 which is clearly inconsistent with expected scatter of 6 . for trial periods near 55 d",
    ", we found two nearby minima in @xmath26 , corresponding to two slightly different orbital periods , @xmath24=64 d ( rms=23 ) and @xmath24=59 d ( rms=36 ) .",
    "figure 3 shows the velocities as a function of orbital phase for the better of those fits ( @xmath24=64 d ) . that keplerian fit carries an implied eccentricity of @xmath2=0.69 , @xmath23=292 , and a companion minimum mass of @xmath0= 4.0 m@xmath1 .",
    "however the scatter to that fit , rms=23.3 , clearly exceeds the expected scatter of 6 , implying that this fit carries a reduced @xmath26 greater than 4 and hence this model is inadequate .",
    "indeed , two telltale points located at phase @xmath80.95 ( see figure 3 ) were obtained on consecutive nights .",
    "the second velocity was 58 higher , and yet according to the keplerian curve , it should reside lower by 60 .",
    "we consider this dubious orbital fit to imply that the keplerian model fails in some important way .",
    "we modified the model by simply adding a variable linear trend to keplerian velocities .",
    "such a model incorporates the possibility of a long period companion in addition to the shorter  period companion .",
    "this slope introduces only one additional free parameter , as the `` y - intercept '' of the slope is subsumed within the arbitrary zero  point of the velocities .",
    "the keplerian  plus  slope model is shown in figure 4 and yields a best fit orbital period of , @xmath24=57.8 d , @xmath23=350 , @xmath2=0.54 , and @xmath0=5.04 m@xmath1 .",
    "the rms of the residuals , 12.8 , is considerably reduced from rms=23.3 that results from a model without a trend .",
    "the reduced @xmath26 for this solution is 2.3 .",
    "all orbital parameters are given in table 3 .",
    "thus , it appears that the introduction of an _ ad hoc _ slope into the keplerian model for hd168443 significantly improves the fit .",
    "however , the rms of 12.8 remains larger than the expected scatter of 6 , implying that the addition of a velocity slope is too simple . introducing an _ ad hoc _ parabolic term in the velocity trend reduces the rms to 8 ( @xmath26=1.5 ) , superior to that of a linear trend .",
    "however , we feel that introducing this parabolic free parameter carries only marginal statistical justification . a proper model that contained a second orbiting companion would require the introduction of an additional set of keplerian parameters , for which we have inadequate constraints .",
    "thus , the only model supported by the current data is that containing the linear trend .",
    "we tested the predictability of this model with two additional velocity measurements obtained with the 0.6m cat telescope at lick observatory .",
    "we obtained spectra on two consecutive nights , centered on julian dates 2451100.644 and 2451101.645 for which the model containing the keplerian and linear trend offered a prediction of an increase in velocity of 52.4 . on both nights we obtained four consecutive spectra , each lasting 30 min .",
    "each spectrum was analyzed separately to derive a doppler shift .",
    "the four velocities were averaged , to yield the final velocity for each night .",
    "the uncertainty in the mean was computed from the standard deviation of the four separate measurements , giving an internal error for each night .",
    "these two lick velocities were 24.2 @xmath10 6.2 and + 24.1 @xmath10 3 on the two nights , respectively , implying that the velocity of hd168443 increased by + 48.3 @xmath10 7 .",
    "this velocity increase agrees with the prediction of the model ( keplerian plus trend ) of + 52.4 .",
    "these lick velocities were obtained 26 days after the last keck measurements were made , on jd=24511074.785 , shown in figure 4 .",
    "the alternative model without an imposed velocity trend has a longer period of @xmath24=64.3 d , and its predicted change in velocity is 60 , clearly in conflict ( wrong sign ) with the observed rise of 48 .",
    "thus , both the lower velocity rms and the lick measurements favor the model that contains a keplerian with @xmath24=57.8 d and a velocity trend .",
    "the best  fit velocity trend has slope of 89.4 per yr which could be caused by a second more distant companion .",
    "if so , its minimum orbital period is @xmath84 yr . as a benchmark , jupiter causes a trend of @xmath84 per yr in the sun during 6 yr .",
    "thus , if the period of the hypothetical second companion to hd168443 were @xmath812 yr , its mass would be at least @xmath825 m@xmath1 .",
    "for the shortest possible period of 4 yr , the companion mass would be at least 15 m@xmath1 . in both cases ,",
    "the companion would be considered a `` brown dwarf '' and quite possibly a hydrogen  burning star , depending on the actual period and @xmath27 .",
    "prospective stellar companions are discussed in section 3.2      we have obtained 33 velocity measurements for hd114762 since 1994 nov .",
    "they are plotted versus orbital phase in figure 5 .",

    "we rule out any main sequence companion with a separation of 0.8 arcsec ( 17 au ) to 12 arcsec ( 250 au ) .",
    "we further rule out any stellar companions out to @xmath41 separations using 2.5 arcsec fwhm @xmath42 and @xmath39 images obtained from the lick 3-m with the ucla two - channel infrared camera known as `` gemini '' ( mclean et al .",
    "the @xmath42 and @xmath39 data were taken simultaneously on 09 october 1998 ut with two 256  @xmath35  256 detectors , a rockwell hgcdte nicmos-3 one for @xmath42 and a hughes - sbrc insb one for @xmath39 .",
    "there are a handful of @xmath43 unresolved sources in these images ; the majority of these also appear on the palomar sky survey .",
    "their @xmath44 colors are consistent with background stars or galaxies , and their numbers are in accord with field @xmath23-band galaxy counts ( szokoly et al . 1998 ) . comparing our images with those on the palomar sky survey , the only source which shows noticeable proper motion is hd210277 itself , which exhibits a magnitude and direction consistent with its nominal proper motion .",
    "we have searched for stellar companions to hd168443 in several ways .",
    "a literature search turned up no known companions .",
    "we searched for superimposed spectral lines from a secondary star in the 8400 region of our lick spectra ( near the caii ir triplet ) .",
    "no such lines were found at a threshold of a few percent of the continuum .",
    "this nondetection rules out any main  sequence companions more massive than 0.5 m@xmath15within 2.5 arcsec ( 95 au ) of hd168443 , as we use a slit width of 5 arcsec with the lick observatory coud auxiliary telescope .",
    "carney et al . ( 1994 ) obtained 8 radial velocity velocity measurements of hd168443 spanning 5 yr and detected no variation above the errors of 400 .",
    "any stellar companion more massive than 0.1 m@xmath15@xmath33 orbiting within 5 au would have been revealed , except for extreme values of @xmath27 .",
    "the hipparcos astrometry of hd168443 recorded no astrometric motion at a level of 2 mas during several years ( perryman et al .",
    "1997 ) . a stellar companion having 0.1 m@xmath15  at 5 au would induce a ( curved ) astrometric reflex motion of 16 mas during @xmath83 yr ( 1/4 orbital period ) , as viewed from a distance of 38 pc .",
    "such a wobble evidently did not occur , thus ruling out stellar companions within 5 au , consistent with the velocity data .",
    "hipparcos would not easily detect stellar companions orbiting beyond 5 au , as the ( more linear ) reflex motion could be absorbed into the assessment of proper motion .",
    "thus , stellar companions orbiting beyond 5 au might escape detection by both the carney et al .",
    "velocities and the hipparcos astrometry .",
    "we have not obtained an adaptive optics image of the star , leaving us little information about stellar companions farther than 5 au .",
    "however , we were compelled to include a velocity slope of 89 per yr in the model of our velocities ( fig 4 ) .",
    "this slope could indicate a stellar companion beyond 5 au , or a brown dwarf somewhat closer . as a benchmark ,",
    "a 0.1 m@xmath15@xmath33 companion orbiting at 10 au would induce a typical velocity slope of 100 per yr ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "our keck velocities are consistent with such a stellar companion as well as more distant and correspondingly more massive ones .",
    "the upper mass limit of 0.5 m@xmath15 , imposed by the lack of secondary lines , implies that the companion must reside within @xmath830 au in order to induce the observed velocity slope of 89 per yr .",
    "a consistency check on the putative companion is provided by comparing the absolute velocities obtained by carney et al ( 1994 ) to those found here .",
    "carney et al . obtained 8 velocity measurements centered at epoch @xmath81990 which exhibited an average of 48.9 , with @xmath40=0.4 .",
    "our observation on 1998 aug 25 gave a velocity of 49.0@xmath102 , which agrees with the carney measurement within the 2 uncertainty .",
    "this implies an upper limit to the velocity trend of 2 per 8 yr , which is indeed larger than the trend we actually detect of 89 per year .    in summary , any stellar companion must reside beyond 5 au but not beyond 30 au to explain the observed velocity trend , and its mass must be less than 0.5 m@xmath15to explain the lack of stellar secondary lines .",
    "a direct search for a stellar companion located 0.151 arcsec from hd 168443 seems warranted .",
    "the two extrasolar planet candidates suggested by the data in this paper bring the total number of such candidates to 17 .",

    "the typical uncertainty in the orbital eccentricity is 0.03 , based on monte carlo simulations of the keplerian fits to data with artificial noise    table 4 shows that all 9 planet candidates that have a@xmath120.2 au have eccentricities above 0.1 , larger than that for both jupiter ( @xmath2=0.048 ) and saturn ( @xmath460.055 ) .",
    "figure 7 shows a plot of orbital eccentricities vs. semimajor axis .",

    "1998 ) .",
    "apparently , jupiter  mass companions orbiting from 0.22.5 au , immune to tides , have large orbital eccentricities .",
    "apparently , some mechanism commonly produces eccentric orbits in jupiter  mass companions that reside from 0.2  2.5 au in main  sequence stars .",
    "these eccentric planets represent a general property of 0.31.2 m@xmath15  stars .",
    "figure 8 shows orbital eccentricities vs. @xmath0 .",
    "no trend is apparent at first glance , suggesting that orbital eccentricity is not correlated with planet mass , within the mass range 0.55 m@xmath1 .",
    "however , all 5 planets with @xmath0@xmath41.1 m@xmath1reside in nearly circular orbits .",
    "this correlation may be a selection effect , as the lowest  mass planets are more easily detected close to their host stars in order to induce a detectable doppler reflex signal .",
    "these close planets are all subject to tidal circularization .",
    "thus , the low eccentricities among the lowest mass giant planets may not be considered intrinsic to planet formation .",

    "semimajor axis for all 17 planet candidates .",
    "the detectability of planetary companions is shown as the curved line near the bottom ( cumming et al .",
    "apparently , the distribution of planet masses is not a strong function of semimajor axis from 0.052.5 au for the range of detectable masses , 16 m@xmath1 .",
    "there is no paucity of either the most or least massive companions at either extreme of semimajor axis .",
    "of course there may be some blurring in mass due to @xmath27 .",
    "nonetheless , we conclude that if orbital migration within a gaseous disk brings the giant plants inward , neither that process nor the halting mechanism seems to depend on planet mass .",
    "figure 10 shows a histogram of msini within the range 0@xmath415 m@xmath1for known companions to main  sequence stars .",
    "the distribution of @xmath0shows a rapid decline at roughly 4 m@xmath1 .",
    "there are no companions having @xmath0= 7.511 m@xmath1and those massive companions would have been easily detected .",
    "this absence seems statistically significant relative to the 14 companions having @xmath0=0.45 m@xmath1 .",
    "all selection effects favor detection of the high  mass companions , and thus the apparent drop in the @xmath0histogram from 4 to 7 m@xmath1must be real .",
    "this drop implies that the distribution of companion masses , d@xmath47/d@xmath16 , must indeed exhibit a decline at @xmath85 m@xmath1with increasing mass , within 2.5 au .",
    "the highest value of @xmath0among planet candidates ( fig 10 ) is for hd114762 which has @xmath0=11.02 m@xmath1 , which is well above the decline at @xmath85 m@xmath1 .",
    "its unknown @xmath27 leaves an important question unanswered regarding its true mass and hence any affiliation with `` planets . '' with that possible exception of hd114762 , the planetary mass distribution certainly declines rapidly for masses above 5 m@xmath1 .",
    "the origin of the distribution of semimajor axes and eccentricities now presents a puzzle . in the standard paradigm ,",
    "giant planets form outside 4 au ( boss 1995 , lissauer 1995 ) . inward orbital migration ( lin et al .",
    "1995 , trilling et al .",
    "1998 ) within the gaseous protoplanetary disk has been suggested to explain the small orbits detected to date among extrasolar planets .",
    "such migration makes two predictions that appear testable .",
    "first , orbital migration in a viscous , gaseous environment is expected to preserve circular orbits under most circumstances ( but see artymowicz 1993 ) .",
    "in contrast , all 9 planet candidates orbiting between 0.2 and 2.5 au have non  circular orbits .",
    "second , the orbital migration time scale is proportional to the orbital period , which leads to rapid orbital decay for successively smaller orbits .",
    "in contrast , the observed orbital semimajor axes are spread throughout 0.1 to 2.5 au ( though not necessarily distributed uniformly ) .",
    "no obvious mechanism is known to halt the migration for these orbits .",
    "apparently , the orbits with sizes of @xmath81 au and large eccentricities ( @xmath90.1 ) require physical processes that are not explicitly included within the context of quiescent migration in a dissipative medium .",
    "scattering of orbits by other planets , companion stars , or passing stars in the young star cluster offer mechanisms for producing eccentric orbits ( rasio and ford 1995 , lin and ida 1996 , weidenschilling and marzari 1996 , laughlin and adams 1998 ) .",
    "however , these mechanisms do not explicitly predict small orbits of @xmath451 au , because significant energy must be lost from the original orbits of @xmath85 au .",
    "one possibility is that planet ",
    "scattering continues to occur during the final era of the remnant gaseous protoplanetary disk .",
    "if the disk remains intact within the inner few au where the original gas density was highest , the disk can serve as the reservoir into which the planet s orbital energy can be deposited , either by dynamical friction or by tidal interaction between planet and disk . in this scenario , scattered planets would reside in eccentric orbits subjecting them to dissipation during periastron passages . clearly detailed models are required that include both planet scattering and the dissipative effects of a weak inner gaseous disk to determine the resulting planetary orbits .    in any case",
    ", we currently have little information about giant planets that orbit beyond 3 au .",
    "we expect to obtain such information in the coming years as doppler programs extend their time baseline .",
    "planets beyond 3 au may well reside in predominantly circular orbits .",
    "a population of giant planets that never suffered significant scattering or migration could comprise these jupiter analogs .",
    "the lack of main sequence stars having reflex doppler periodicities with amplitudes above 30 already indicates a paucity of planets having @xmath483 m@xmath1within 5 au ( cumming et al .",
    "it remains to be determined if the planet mass function rises rapidly for smaller masses .",
