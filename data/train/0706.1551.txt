    "the observations of mrk 501 in the very high energy ( ) domain were carried out with the major atmospheric gamma - ray imaging cherenkov ( * * ) telescope ( see @xcite for details of magic ) .",
    "the net observation time on the source is 31.6 hours ( 24 nights ) between may and july 2005 .",
    "quasi - simultaneously to the  data , mrk 501 was regularly observed with kva as a part of tuorla observatory s blazar monitoring program .",
    "and we also used data taken with the _ rxte _ satellite s all - sky - monitor ( ) .",
    "* the overall light curve * ( lc ) of during the  observation campaign is shown in fig .",
    "the observed flux is shown in three energy bands :   ( 0.15 - 10 ) ,  ( 2 - 10 ) , and optical ( 1.5 - 2.5 ) as measured by , and kva , respectively",
    ". the  and optical fluxes are computed as weighted averages using  and kva measurements taken simultaneously with the   observations plus / minus a time tolerance of 0.2 days . a smaller time tolerance substantially decreases the number of  points that can be used .",
    "the  flux level of the crab nebula ( lilac - dashed horizontal line in the top plot ) is also shown in the upper plot of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for comparison .",
    "the crab nebula flux was obtained by applying the very same analysis used for mrk 501 to the magic crab nebula data taken during december 2005 under observing conditions similar to those for mrk 501 .",
    "the estimated crab nebula flux level is therefore roughly affected by the same systematics as the fluxes obtained for mrk 501 .",
    "we found @xmath2(@xmath3@xmath4tev)=(3.2@xmath50.1)@xmath6@xmath7 @xmath8s@xmath9 , thereafter referred to as crab unit ( ) .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows that the  flux from was about 0.5  during most of the observation nights ; yet there are significant deviations from this mean  emission , with large flux variations occurring in consecutive nights .    during the two nights with the highest  activity ( @xmath33 ) , namely june 30 and july 9 , mrk 501 clearly showed * intra - night flux variations*. the corresponding lc in the 0.15 - 10 tev band",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] with a time binning of @xmath02 minutes .",
    "a constant line fit to the whole lc gives a @xmath10 ( probability @xmath11 ) for the night of june 30 , and a @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) for the night of july 9 .",
    "therefore , the emission above 150  during the two nights is statistically inconsistent with being constant .",
    "the burst s amplitude and duration , as well as its rise / fall times , were quantified according to the following function @xcite :",
    "@xmath14    this model parametrizes a flux variation ( flare ) superposed on a stable emission : @xmath15 asymptotically tends to @xmath16 when @xmath17 .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 is the assumed constant flux at the time of the flare ( cf .",

    "[ fig2 ] ) ; @xmath18 is set to the time corresponding to the point with the highest value in the lc ; and @xmath19 are left free to vary .",
    "the latter two parameters denote the flux - doubling rise and fall times , respectively .",
    "the resulting fit parameters are reported in the insets of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , * showing flux - doubling times of the order of 2 minutes*. this is the fastest flux variability ever observed from mrk 501 .",
    "these bursts were also studied in four non - overlapping energy ranges ; 0.15 - 0.25 , 0.25 - 0.6 , 0.6 - 1.2  and @xmath31.2",
    ". the main outcome of this study is _ a ) _ the burst from june 30 is significant only in the energy range 0.25 - 0.6 , while the burst from july 9 is significantly observed in all energy ranges ; _ b ) _ in the july 9 burst , the highest energies are delayed by 4 @xmath5 1 minutes with respect to the lowest energies ; and _ c ) _ in the july 9 burst , the relative amplitude of the flux variation increases with energy .",
    "further details from these studies can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "mrk 501 showed * energy - dependent flux variations * throughout the entire  observational campaign .",
    "we followed the prescription given in @xcite to quantify the flux variability by means of the fractional variability parameter , as a function of energy .",
    "the outcome of this calculation is shown in the left - hand plot of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ; the flux variability increases with energy .",
    "the same tendency was reported at  frequencies , but with lower values of  @xcite .    during our observations ,",
    "the  emission of was very dynamic , showing significant * spectral variability * on a timescale of days .",
    "nevertheless , most of the data are well described by a simple power - law ( pl ) function .",
    "this does not hold for the two flaring nights of june 30 and july 9 which show clear spectral curvature and thus they are fit with a log - parabolic ( lp ) function .",
    "@xmath20    here , @xmath21 is a normalization factor , @xmath16 is the spectral index at 0.3 tev , and @xmath22 is a curvature parameter .    the right - hand plot of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the * energy spectra * ( ebl corrected ) of mrk 501 for the flaring nights ( june 30 and july 9 ) for three different flux levels , _ low _ , _ medium _ and _ high _ , which contain 12 , 8 and 2 ( `` non - flaring '' ) nights respectively .",
    "see caption of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for definition of flux levels .",
    "the data shows very clearly a hardening of the spectra with increasing flux .",
    "besides , the data from the flaring nights suggest the presence of a * spectral peak*. the location of this peak , determined using the fit parameters and errors from the log - parabolic fit , is 0.85 @xmath5 0.13  and 0.44 @xmath5 0.08  for june 30 and july 9 , respectively .",
    "if this peak exists for the data sets _ low _ , _ medium _ and _ high _ , then its location is certainly below 0.1 .",
