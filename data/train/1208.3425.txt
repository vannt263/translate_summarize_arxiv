    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are interacting binaries with a white dwarf accreting matter from a main sequence companion star through a roche lobe , with a typical orbital period of few hours ( see for a review ) .",
    "many of the cvs have high magnetic fields and are called as magnetic cvs ( mcvs ) . the mcvs are further classified as polars , and intermediate polars ( ips ; see , ) based on the strength of the observed magnetic fields in them .",
    "polars have very high magnetic fields ( 10 - 80  mg ) which do not allow the formation of accretion discs , but help to synchronise the spin and orbital periods to a very high degree . intermediate polars have somewhat less magnetic fields compared to polars ( @xmath4 10 mg ) but sufficient to disrupt the accretion disc and truncate it at a certain distance from the white dwarf .",
    "the ips typically have a spin period of few hundreds of seconds and orbital periods of few hours and many ips cluster around a p@xmath5/p@xmath6 @xmath7 0.05 - 0.15 . the accreting matter in both polars and ips falls on to the white dwarf through poles along the magnetic field lines .",
    "a few ips show disc - less accretion , and in some cases accretion stream is seen to flip between the two poles as was first reported in v2400 oph by .",
    "generally the ips are hard x - ray emitters .",
    "however , many ips also show a soft x - ray excess typically of a blackbody component in soft x - rays ( , , ) .",
    "the soft blackbody component in ips is usually attributed to the presence of accretion curtains .",
    "the integral / ibis soft gamma - ray survey has detected a total of 32 cvs till now which is close to 10 per cent of integral detections .",
    "these detections are identified mainly with mcvs with 22 confirmed or probable ips and three polars .",
    "igr j17195 - 4100 ( igr1719 hereafter ) was detected as a source in integral  observations by and was later identified with an optical object of r@xmath8 @xmath7 14.3  mag and classified as an ip by based on its optical spectrum .",

    "@xcite determined the distance of igr1719  close to 110  pc assuming an absolute magnitude m@xmath9 @xmath4 9 .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of the ip as given by @xcite is 3.6@xmath1010@xmath11  erg  s@xmath12 in the 0.5 - 10.0  kev energy range and 5.5@xmath1010@xmath11 erg  s@xmath12 in the 20 - 100  kev energy range .",

    "the observations were continuous and taken with the three instruments epic - mos1 , mos2 and pn ( and ) which provide medium resolution spectroscopy in the energy range of 0.2 - 12.0  kev .",
    "we used the latest science analysis software ( sas ) version 11.0 software package for data reduction and extraction of lightcurves and generation of spectral products .",
    "the temporal and spectral analyses were carried out using xronos and _ xspec _ version 12.7 (; ) packages provided in _ heasoft _ ( version 6.11 ) .",
    "@xcite , the fifth japanese x- ray astrophysical observatory , observed igr1719  on 2009 february 18 - 19 for a total of @xmath473  ks .",
    "_ suzaku _ observes in the energy range of 0.2 - 600  kev with the help of two instruments , x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ; @xcite ) and the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ; @xcite ) .",
    "the xis consists of four x - ray imaging charge coupled device ( ccd ) cameras at the focal plane of each of the four x - ray telescopes ( xrt ; ) .",
    "the energy coverage of xis is similar to the _ xmm - newton _ energy range of 0.2 - 12.0  kev .",
    "the xis2 camera stopped working near the end of 2006 , and therefore we use the data only from the remaining three xis cameras ( xis0 , xis1 and xis3 ) .",
    "the _ suzaku _",
    "observations of igr1719  were analysed with the latest _ heasoft _",

    "a log of the observations of igr1719  is given in table  [ tab - obs ] .",
    "[ cols=\"^,<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     according to @xcite , the power spectrum of an ip with a simple disc - less geometry is dominated by signals at spin frequency ( @xmath15 ) , beat frequency ( @xmath16 ) and second beat frequency ( 2@xmath17 ) components with the condition that one of the latter should always be present , whereas the disc accreting systems show only the spin frequency component ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "therefore , the presence of a dominating power at spin period ( @xmath18=1053.7  s ) and a significant power at the orbital sideband at 1149.4  s in the igr1719  x - ray power spectra suggests a predominant contribution from the disc - less accretion component in igr1719   making igr1719  a member of the rare disc - less accreting ips .",
    "x - ray pulsations at the orbital beat period are seen when the accreting material is directly coupled with the magnetic field lines .",
    "the power spectra of igr1719  are similar to rx j1803 power spectra of _ xmm - newton _",
    "lightcurves though the modulation at the beat period is significantly less compared to the spin period modulation",
    ". also suggest that in a disc - less accretion system , the power in the spin period decreases with the energy , whereas the power in the beat period increases with energy .",
    "this is attributed to the absorption of low energy photons by the accretion column itself . in the intermediate polars ,",
    "the highest energy x - rays are produced by shocks above the white dwarf surface and hence are less prone to absorption by the accretion column resulting in the decrease of modulation .",
    "the softer x - rays are emitted closer to the white dwarf surface than the harder x - rays are , and are thus more prone to absorption by the accretion column and hence , resulting in the increase of amplitude modulation .",
    "the igr1719  power spectra obtained in different energy bands show that the amplitudes of modulation is decreasing with energy ( fig .",
    "[ fig - ft ] ) .",
    "the near absence of any significant power near the spin period or the orbital side band in the hard x - ray power spectrum also suggests that the hard x - rays originate at a much higher altitude in the accretor . combining this zero power at the spin period in the hard x - rays ( @xmath19kev ) , but a significant power in the beat period at 1149.4  s along with power in orbital period and its harmonics in the hard x - rays further supports the disc - less accretion .    a partial absorber in front of a multi - temperature plasma in a cooling flow model best explains the _ xmm - newton _ spectra of igr1719 .",
    "the multi - temperature plasma produced in the shock region just above the white dwarf is thus seen through two absorbers , an ism component ( n@xmath20 = 1.12@xmath1010@xmath21  @xmath22 ) and a thick partial covering absorber ( n@xmath20 = 7.3@xmath1010@xmath23  @xmath22 ) . the estimated value of the partial covering absorber fraction matches with the fraction obtained by @xcite for igr1719  using _ suzaku _ data .",
    "the spectra of igr1719  indicate the presence of a very high temperature for which we could only obtain a lower limit . reported the mass of white dwarf to be 1.03@xmath13  m@xmath24 .",
    "we estimated the maximum shock temperature corresponding to this mass as 64.6@xmath25  kev using the relation , @xmath26 where the radius r@xmath27 is calculated from the white dwarf mass - radius relation given by @xcite is 5.24@xmath2810@xmath29  cm .",
    "the calculated shock temperature of the igr1719  explains the un - bound high temperature values obtained from the cooling flow spectral models .",
    "the fe abundance in the multi temperature plasma is very close to solar abundance and reproduces the observed fe lines at 6.7 and 7.0  kev completely .",
    "the x - ray flux obtained from different spectral models are very similar in the value . for the best fitting apec+mkcflow model , the flux in 0.3 - 10.0  kev energy band",
    "is estimated to be 3.1@xmath1010@xmath30 erg  @xmath22  s@xmath12 which yields an x - ray luminosity of 4.5@xmath1010@xmath11 erg  s@xmath12 .",
    "using the relation l = gmm/2r and taking the mass of the white dwarf as 1.03  m@xmath24 and a radius of 5.24@xmath1010@xmath29  cm calculated from the @xcite white dwarf mass - radius relation , we obtain a mass accretion rate of 5.5@xmath1010@xmath31  m@xmath24  yr@xmath12 .",
    "a growing number of ips show a soft x - ray excess with blackbody temperatures less than 100  ev ( , , , ) .",
    "though the _ xmm - newton _ spectra of igr1719  show a soft excess , the residuals showed several un - resolved lines around 0.5  kev energy , and the spectral fits with an additional blackbody component did not improve in the chi - square . alternatively a low temp _",
    "component with a kt of 175  ev did improve the chi - square , and was found to be more suitable .",
    "this is also consistent with the improvement seen using continuous temperature models like mkcflow .",
    "the kt@xmath32175  ev is significantly higher than the typical blackbody temperatures ( 30 - 120  ev ) of other soft ips",
    ".    suggest that the main reason for some ips to show soft excess is that the accretion curtains do not hide the accretion footprints .",
    "the soft x - ray excess in igr1719  thus suggests a highly inclined magnetic axis in the system .",
    "we calculated a softness ratio of 0.0064 from the unabsorbed flux of igr1719  which matches the softness ratio of v2400  oph within one sigma error .",
    "this is interesting , that although a soft x - ray component with a ratio similar to that in other ips exists in igr1719 , but a simple black body model typically used for the soft excess is unable to explain the soft excess seen in igr1719 .",
    "the multi - temperature plasma models do not reproduce the observed 6.4  kev fe fluorescent line , thus requiring the addition of a gaussian component .",
    "the observed fluorescent line is compatible with the emission from comparatively cold iron in the ionization states fe i to fe xvii and does not show any significant broadening . this line feature in the x - ray spectra is seen in several ips and polars ( , ) and usually understood as due to reflection from cold matter .    from the spin phase",
    "resolved spectroscopy ( @xmath33[sec - phi ] ) , we found that the variation in the partial covering fraction ( pcf ) of the absorber is anti - correlated with the x - ray intensity whereas the softness ratio ( f@xmath34 ) varies in phase with the x - ray intensity . in an ip with an accretion curtain",
    ", self absorption can cause such a variation in the x - ray intensity . when the curtain is maximally in the line of sight , the x - ray intensity will be minimum due to the maximum absorption , and",
    "the light intensity will be the maximum when either the curtain moves away from the line of sight or when it thins down .",
    "similarly , more of the soft x - ray photons assumed to be from the accretion footprint will be absorbed if the accretion curtain is in the line of sight resulting in the reduction of softness ratio , and the softness ratio will increase when the curtains do not hinder the accretion footprint .",
    "hence , the soft excess appears to be related to the pcf only , indicating that the phase modulation in the soft x - rays is due to varying coverage by the accretion curtains towards the line of sight .    in our discussion",
    ", we have assumed that the x - ray period of 1053.7  s in the xmm - newton data is the spin period of the white dwarf and the period at 1149.4  s is the orbital side - band .",
    "but , we can not rule out the plausibility of 1149.4  s being the spin period and 1053.7  s being the side - band .",
    "also , the 1149.4  s period almost matches with 1139.6  s period seen in the optical photometry data @xcite of igr1719  and is reported to be due to spin of the white dwarf .",
    "if true , spin at 1149.4  s and orbital side - band at 1053.7  s would imply a retrograde white dwarf rotation in igr1719  similar to igr  j1817 and xss  j0056 @xcite .",
    "generally the spin modulation of an intermediate polar is attributed to a combination of varying photo electric absorption and self absorption between the observer and the x - ray emitting regions .",
    "hence , we are expected to see an anti - correlation of partial covering fraction with the spin .",
    "a near constant partial covering fraction with the phase of 1149.4  s period and an anti - correlation with the phase of 1053.7  s period thus support our earlier assumption of 1053.7  s as the white dwarf spin and 1149.4  s as the orbital side - band .",
    "our timing analysis of the archival _ xmm - newton _ and _ suzaku _ data of igr1719 shows a dominant frequency at 0.949@xmath10.011  mhz corresponding to a period of 1053.7@xmath112.2  s and another close period at 1149.4  s. we propose that the period at 1053.7  s is the spin period of the white dwarf , and the period at 1149.4  s is the orbital sideband , and thus we estimate the orbital period as 3.52@xmath2  h. we also provide an ephemeris of this spin period . though the results of the phase resolved spectroscopy performed at the two periods 1053.7  s and 1149.4  s favours the proposed period at 1053.7  s as the white dwarf spin period , polarimetric detection of the spin period of igr1719  is needed to confirm the spin period .",
    "the power spectra obtained in different energy bands suggest that igr1719  is a candidate for the rare group of disc - less ips .",
    "a partially and fully absorbed cooling flow model satisfactorily explains the observed spectra of igr1719 .",
    "the partial covering fraction varies between 0.34 at the spin minima to 0.46 at the spin maxima indicating a geometrical change in the absorber with spin phase .",
    "we also report a soft x - ray excess which can be modelled with a low kt _ apec",
    "we detect a 6.4  kev fluorescent line which can be attributed to the emission from cold iron in the ionization states up to fe  xvii from the white dwarf surface . from the observed flux in the 0.3 - 10.0  kev energy range",
    ", we estimate a mass accretion rate of 5.5@xmath1010@xmath35  yr@xmath12 .    from the temporal and spectral analysis the image of igr1719  that emerges",
    "is of a disc - less accreting system where the matter from the secondary is threaded along a magnetic pole as a stream resulting in modulations of x - rays at the orbital beat period .",
    "the shocks formed above the white dwarf surface give a multi temperature spectra with a shock temperature above 64  kev .",
    "the soft x - ray excess seen in igr1719  may be emitted by the unhindered accretion footprint .",
