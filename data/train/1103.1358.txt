    "the linear - chain structure of three @xmath1 clusters in c isotopes has been a long standing problem , for example , as discussed in refs .",
    "historically , the @xmath6 state in @xmath7c was suggested to be a candidate for the linear - chain structure of three @xmath1 clusters @xcite . however , according to @xmath3 cluster model calculations in the 1970s , it was pointed out that the @xmath6 state is not a linear - chain state , but a weak coupling state , where three @xmath1 clusters are weakly interacting with each other @xcite . in recent years , the @xmath6 state attracts an interest as the @xmath1 condensed state in analogy to bose einstein condensation in nuclear matter @xcite . instead of the @xmath6 state ,",
    "the @xmath8 state was suggested to have a geometric configuration of three @xmath1 clusters @xcite . in the recent works on @xmath7c with antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) and fermionic molecular dynamics ( fmd ) calculations @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath8 state was suggested to have an open triangle structure of three @xmath1 clusters and was assigned to the experimental @xmath9 state at 10.3 mev .",
    "however no linear - chain structure of three @xmath1 clusters nor linear - chain band was found in the @xmath7c system , and therefore , searching for a linear - chain state in c isotopes is still an attractive subject .",
    "linear - chain structures in c isotopes have been discussed in earlier works with 3@xmath1+@xmath10 cluster models @xcite and the skyrme mean - field model @xcite . in the study by itagaki _",
    "et al_. @xcite , they assumed a symmetric 3@xmath1 cluster configuration with valence neutrons in molecular orbitals .",
    "it was argued that the linear - chain structure of @xmath0c may be unstable because there is no local minimum in the energy curve against the bending mode .    however , to confirm the stability of an excited state , it is essential to take into account the orthogonality to lower states .",
    "in contrast to the work of ref .",
    "@xcite , in our previous study on @xmath0c with an amd method @xcite , we found the linear - chain structure and its rotational band consisting of the @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 states in @xmath0c . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we adopted a method of @xmath14-@xmath15 constraint amd in combination with the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) called the @xmath14-@xmath15 constraint amd + gcm @xcite .",
    "although the 3@xmath1 core is not _ a priori _ assumed in the framework , various 3@xmath1+@xmath16 structures are obtained in the energy variation . as a result of energy variation and gcm calculations ,",
    "the linear - chain states appear and show @xmath2be+@xmath1 correlation . here",
    ", the @xmath2be+@xmath1 correlation means an asymmetric @xmath17+@xmath1 configuration with two valence neutrons distributing around the correlating @xmath17 .",
    "we note that three @xmath1 clusters have one geometric configuration , and therefore @xmath2be+@xmath1 ( @xmath17+@xmath1 ) correlation does not have a weak coupling feature , but a strong coupling feature . in other words ,",
    "this @xmath2be is not an isolated one , but a polarized configuration of the middle @xmath1 cluster and valence neutrons in the linear - chain structure .    for excited states of @xmath0c ,",
    "there exist many experimental works suggesting the @xmath2be+@xmath1 cluster structure in the observed excited states above the @xmath2be+@xmath1 threshold @xcite .",
    "we expect that these states might be possible candidates for the linear - chain states .",
    "then we consider that the @xmath2be+@xmath1 correlation is one of the key features of the linear - chain structure .",
    "our aim is to confirm the @xmath2be+@xmath1 correlation in the linear - chain states of @xmath0c . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , our previous work indicates that the stability of the linear - chain structure in @xmath0c is owed to the valence neutron effects and the orthogonality to lower states .",
    "since the bending mode is suppressed by the orthogonality in a @xmath0c system , a @xmath3 cluster core with a straight line configuration is considered to be rather stable against the bending mode .",
    "therefore , in the present study , we consider only the linear configuration and omit the bending mode to find the origin of the @xmath2be+@xmath1 correlation . for @xmath0c ,",
    "this ansatz is probably valid .",
    "in such a linear system , the @xmath2be+@xmath1 correlation can be described by the asymmetry of three @xmath1 clusters and valence neutron motion . here",
    "the first question is whether three @xmath1 clusters favor an asymmetric @xmath17+@xmath1 configuration which were not incorporated in the work by itagaki _",
    "the second question is whether the two neutrons localize and form the @xmath2be cluster or if they are moving around all three @xmath1 clusters as described in the molecular orbital picture @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , in our method used in the previous work @xcite , detailed behavior of valence neutrons in the molecular orbitals is not sufficiently described because a single particle wave function is approximated by a gaussian wave packet .    in the present paper , to investigate the linear - chain structures of @xmath0c we extend the molecular orbital model by explicitly incorporating asymmetric configurations of the linear - chain structure .",
    "we solve the valence neutron motion in the linear @xmath3 system by using a linear combination of @xmath18 orbits around @xmath1 clusters as done in the molecular orbital model . by analyzing the calculated results",

    "even if a linear - chain structure does not exist in realistic @xmath7c and @xmath19c , analysis of @xmath3 and @xmath3+@xmath4 systems with the linear - chain configuration is useful to understand the origin of @xmath2be+@xmath1 correlation suggested in the realistic linear - chain states in @xmath0c .",

    "this indicates that the linear - chain state in @xmath0c can be interpreted as an intermediate state of ` mo ' and ` ao ' to gain both of the kinetic energy and potential energy . on the other hand , other sets of mixing , ` mo+po ' and ` po+ao ' fail to reproduce the results of the generalized molecular orbital model and ` mo+ao ' mixing .",
    "energy surfaces of @xmath0c with the linear - chain structure against the difference between the distances of @xmath1 clusters .",
    "the energy surface for the mixing configurations of ` mo ' , ` po ' , and ` ao ' are illustrated as well as that of the generalized molecular orbital model.,width=298 ]    next , we discuss the relation between the present results and our previous results with amd @xcite . in the present results , the minimum point of the @xmath9 energy surface ( @xmath114 )",
    "has @xmath2be+@xmath1 correlation and 80.4 mev binding energy . in the amd results ,",
    "the main component of the @xmath11 linear - chain state also has @xmath2be+@xmath1 correlation and 80.6 mev binding energy .",
    "the binding energies are almost the same and the valence neutron behaviors are qualitatively similar .",
    "moreover , the overlap between these wave functions is significant as 81% .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the present results correspond to the amd results .",
    "this good correspondence between the present and amd results indicates that the previous amd calculation properly describes the valence neutron configurations in the linear - chain structure of the @xmath11 in @xmath0c . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we expected that the linear - chain states ( rotational band consisting of the @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 states ) might be the candidates for the states observed recently in @xmath2be+@xmath1 breakup reactions .",
    "the @xmath2be+@xmath1 correlation confirmed in the present study supports again this expectation .",
    "we comment on the quantum fluctuation of the @xmath1-@xmath1 distances .",
    "the full solution does not correspond to well defined distances but to a superposition of the wave functions which have various distances because the energy curves are very soft with respect to asymmetry and quantum fluctuation may be large . however , because of the existence of minimum at the asymmetric point , components of asymmetric configuration are expected to largely mix in the superposed wave functions .",
    "it means the importance of be+@xmath1 correlation",
    ".    finally , we comment on the negative parity states of the linear - chain structures in @xmath0c .",
    "because of the asymmetry of the intrinsic state from the @xmath2be+@xmath1 correlation , one can expect negative parity states as a parity partner of the positive - parity linear - chain states @xcite .",
    "however , in the present calculations , energies of negative parity states are much higher , more than 10 mev , than the positive - parity linear - chain states ; therefore , the negative - parity linear - chain states can not appear near the positive - parity linear - chain states .",
    "it is consistent with the previous study on @xmath0c with an amd method @xcite which shows a negative - parity linear - chain state does not appear .",
    "we investigated the linear - chain structures of @xmath0c using a generalized molecular orbital model . in this model",
    ", we incorporated asymmetric configurations of linear three @xmath1 clusters to study the @xmath2be+@xmath1 correlation in @xmath0c .",
    "we also investigated be+@xmath1 correlations in linear @xmath3 and @xmath3+@xmath4 systems to see the effect of three @xmath1 clusters and that of valence neutron motion .",
    "the linear - chain structure of @xmath5c is also studied .",
    "it was found that the linear - chain structure of @xmath0c shows the @xmath2be+@xmath1 correlation , which is characterized by the asymmetric @xmath17+@xmath1 configuration with two valence neutrons distributing around the correlating @xmath17 .",
    "compared with the results for the linear @xmath3 and @xmath3+@xmath4 systems , we find that a linear 3@xmath1 system prefers the asymmetric 2@xmath1+@xmath1 configuration , whose origin is the many body correlation incorporated by the parity projection .",
    "this configuration causes an asymmetric mean field for two valence neutrons , which induces the concentration of valence neutron wave functions around the correlating 2@xmath1 .",
    "these are the origins of the @xmath2be+@xmath1 correlation in the linear - chain structure of @xmath0c . in analysis of motion of valence neutrons",
    ", we find that both the kinetic energy gain and potential energy gain play important roles in the linear three @xmath1 clusters with valence neutrons .",
    "a symmetric configuration of linear three @xmath1 clusters is indicated in @xmath5c .",
    "we also find valence neutrons in a linear - chain structure of @xmath5c have multi - neutron correlation , while those in @xmath0c have no explicit two - neutron correlation .    as a future problem ,",
    "it is important to clarify whether or not a linear - chain structure with a symmetric configuration appears in @xmath5c . for this aim",
