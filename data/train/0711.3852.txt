    "we consider a galton  watson process , that is , a population model with asexual reproduction such that at every generation , each individual gives birth to a random number of children according to a fixed distribution and independently of the other individuals in the population .",
    "we are interested in the situation where a child can be either a clone , that is , of the same type ( or allele ) as its parent , or a mutant , that is , of a new type .",
    "we stress that each mutant has a  distinct type and in turn gives birth to clones of itself and to new mutants according to the same statistical law as its parent , even though it bears a different allele . in other words",
    ", we are working with an infinite alleles model where mutations are neutral for the population dynamics .",
    "we might as well think of a spatial population model in which children either occupy the same location as their parents or migrate to new places and start growing colonies on their own .",
    "this quite basic framework has been often considered in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) ; we also refer to @xcite for interesting variations ( these references are of course far from being exhaustive ) . note also that galton ",
    "watson processes with mutations can be viewed as a special instance of multitype branching processes ( see chapter v in athreya and ney @xcite or chapter 7 in kimmel and axelrod @xcite ) .",
    "we are interested in the partition of the population into clusters of individuals having the same allele , which will be referred to as the _ allelic partition_. statistics of the allelic partition of a random population model with neutral mutations have been first determined in a fundamental work of ewens @xcite for the wright  fisher model ( more precisely this concerns the partition of the population at a fixed generation ) .",
    "kingman @xcite provided a deep analysis of this framework , in connection with the celebrated coalescent process that depicts the genealogy of the wright  fisher model .",
    "we refer to @xcite for some recent developments in this area which involve some related population models with fixed generational size and certain exchangeable coalescents .",
    "the main purpose of the present work is to describe explicitly the structure of the allelic partition of the entire population for galton ",
    "watson processes with neutral mutations .",
    "we will always assume that the galton ",
    "watson process is critical or subcritical , so the descent of any individual becomes eventually extinct , and in particular the allelic clusters are finite a.s .",
    "we suppose that every ancestor ( i.e. , individual in the initial population ) bears a different allele ; it is convenient to view each ancestor as a mutant of the zeroth kind .",
    "we then call mutant of the first kind a mutant - child of an individual of the allelic cluster of an ancestor , and the set of all its clones ( including that mutant ) a cluster of the first kind . by iteration",
    ", we define mutants and clusters of the @xmath0th kind for any integer @xmath1 .    in order to describe the statistics of the allelic partition , we distinguish an ancestor which",
    "will then be referred to as _ eve _ , and focus on its descent .",
    "the set of all individuals bearing the same allele as eve is called the _ eve cluster_. the eve cluster has obviously the genealogical structure of a galton  watson tree with reproduction law given by the distribution of the number of clone - children of a typical individual . informally , the branching property indicates that the same holds for the other clusters of the allelic partition .",
    "further , it should be intuitively clear that the process which counts the number of clusters of the @xmath0th kind for @xmath1 is again a  galton ",
    "watson process whose reproduction law is given by the distribution of the number of mutants of the first kind ; this phenomenon has already been pointed at in the work of tab @xcite .",
    "that is to say that , in some loose sense the allelic partition inherits branching structures from the initial galton  watson process .",
    "of course , these formulations are only heuristic and precise statements will be given later on .",
    "we also stress that the forest structure which connects clusters of different kinds and the genealogical structure on each cluster are not independent since , typically , the number of mutants of the first kind who stem from the eve cluster is statistically related to the size of the eve cluster .",
    "our approach essentially relies on a variation of the well - known connection due to harris @xcite between ordinary galton  watson processes and sequences of i.i.d .",
    "integer - valued random variables .",
    "specifically , we incorporate neutral mutations in harris representation and by combination with the celebrated ballot theorem ( which is another classical tool in this area as it is expounded , e.g. , by pitman ; see chapter 6 in @xcite ) , we obtain expressions for the joint distribution of various natural variables ( size of the total descent of an ancestor , number of alleles , size and number of mutant - children of an allelic cluster ) in terms of the transition probabilities of the two - dimensional random walk which is generated by the numbers of clone - children and of mutant - children of a typical individual .",
    "we also investigate some limit theorems in law ; typically we show that when the numbers of clone - children and mutant - children of an individual are independent ( and some further technical conditions ) , the sequence of the relative sizes of the allelic clusters in a typical tree has a limiting conditional distribution when the size of the tree and the number of types both tend to infinity according to some appropriate regime .",
    "the limiting distribution that arises has already appeared in the study of the standard additive coalescent by aldous and pitman @xcite",
    ". we also point at limit theorems for allelic partitions of galton ",
    "watson forests , where , following duquesne and le gall @xcite , the limits are described in terms of certain lvy trees .",
    "in particular , this provides an explanation to a rather striking identity between two self - similar fragmentation processes that were defined on the one hand by logging the continuum random tree according to a poisson point process along its skeleton @xcite , and on the other hand by splitting the unit - interval at instants when the standard brownian excursion with a negative drift reaches new infima @xcite .",
    "we first develop some material and notation about galton ",
    "watson forests with neutral mutations , referring to chapter 6 in pitman @xcite for background in the case without mutations .",
    "let @xmath2 be a pair of nonnegative integer - valued random variables which should be thought of respectively as the number of clone - children and the number of mutant - children of a typical individual .",
    "we also write @xmath3 for the total number of children , and assume throughout this work that @xmath4 that is , we work in the critical or subcritical regime .",
    "we implicitly exclude the degenerate case when @xmath5 or @xmath6 and , as a consequence , the means @xmath7 and @xmath8 are always less than @xmath9 .",
    "we write @xmath10 and @xmath11 for the sets of nonnegative integers and positive integers , respectively . a pair @xmath12",
    "is then used to identify an individual in an infinite population model , where the first coordinate @xmath13 refers to the generation and the second coordinate @xmath14 to the rank of the individual of that generation ( we stress that each generation consists of an infinite sequence of individuals ) .",
    "we assume that each individual at generation @xmath15 has a unique parent at generation @xmath13 .",
    "we consider a family @xmath16 of i.i.d .",
    "copies of @xmath17 which we use to define the galton  watson process with neutral mutations . specifically , @xmath18 is the pair given by the number of clone - children and mutant - children of the @xmath14th individual at generation @xmath13 .",
    "we may assume that the offspring of each individual is ranked , which induces a natural order at the next generation by requiring further that if @xmath19 and @xmath20 are two individuals at the same generation @xmath13 with @xmath21 , then at generation @xmath15 the children of @xmath19 are all listed before those of @xmath20 .",
    "next , we enumerate as follows the individuals of the entire population ( i.e. , of all generations ) by a  variation of the well - known depth - first search algorithm that takes mutations into account .",
    "we associate to each individual a label @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the rank of the ancestor in the initial population , @xmath24 the number of mutations and @xmath25 a finite sequence of positive integers which keeps track of the genealogy of the individual .",
    "specifically , the label of the @xmath26th individual in the initial generation @xmath27 is @xmath28 . if an individual at the @xmath13th generation has the label @xmath29 , and if this individual has @xmath30 clone - children and @xmath31 mutant - children , then the labels assigned to its clone - children are @xmath32 whereas the labels assigned to its mutant - children are @xmath33    clearly , any two distinct individuals have different labels .",
    "we then introduce the ( random ) map @xmath34 which consists in ranking the individuals in the lexicographic order of their labels ; see figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "that is to say that @xmath35 if and only if the @xmath36th individual in the lexicographic order of labels corresponds to the @xmath14th individual at generation  @xmath13 . this procedure for enumerating the individuals will be referred to as the _ depth - first search algorithm with mutations_. we shall also use the notation @xmath37 and whenever no generation is specified , the terminology @xmath36th individual will implicitly refer to the rank of that individual induced by depth - first search with mutation , that is , the @xmath36th individual means the @xmath14th individual at generation @xmath13 where @xmath35 .",
    "represent the different alleles .",
    "left : the label @xmath38 of an individual is given by the number @xmath24 of mutations and the sequence @xmath25 that specifies its genealogy ; for the sake of simplicity , the rank @xmath26 of the ancestor has been omitted .",
    "right : the same tree with individuals ranked by the depth - first search algorithm with mutations . ]    [ le1 ] the variables @xmath39 are i.i.d . with the same law as @xmath17 .",
    "the sequence @xmath40 can be recovered from @xmath41 a.s .",
    "it should be plain from the definition of the depth - first search algorithm with mutations that for every @xmath42 , @xmath43 is a deterministic function of @xmath44 which takes values in @xmath45 . since @xmath46 is a sequence of i.i.d .",
    "variables with the same law as @xmath17 , this yields the first claim by induction .",
    "the second claim follows from the fact that each individual has a finite descent a.s .",
    "[ because the galton  watson process is critical ] , which easily entails that the map @xmath47 is bijective .",
    "further , it is readily seen that the inverse bijection is a function of the sequence @xmath41 .",
    "henceforth , we shall therefore encode the galton ",
    "watson process with neutral mutations by a sequence @xmath41 of i.i.d .",
    "copies of @xmath17 .",
    "we denote by @xmath48 the natural filtration generated by this sequence .",
    "we next briefly describe the genealogy of the galton ",
    "watson process as a forest of i.i.d .",
    "genealogical trees .",
    "denote for every @xmath49 by @xmath50 so that @xmath51 is the increasing sequence of the ranks of ancestors induced by the depth - first search algorithm with mutations .",
    "for example , in the situation described by figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the procedure for labeling individuals ensures that the descent of the @xmath36th ancestor @xmath52 corresponds to the integer interval @xmath53 ( that is to say , if we index the population model using generations , then the descent of @xmath54 is the image of @xmath55 by the inverse bijection @xmath56 ) .",
    "we write @xmath57 for the finite sequence of the numbers of clone - children and mutant - children of the individuals in the descent of the @xmath36th ancestor .",
    "so @xmath58 encodes ( by the depth - first search algorithm with mutations ) the genealogical tree of the @xmath36th ancestor , and it should be intuitively clear that the family @xmath59 is a forest consisting in a sequence of i.i.d . genealogical trees . to give a rigorous statement , it is convenient to introduce the downward skip - free ( or left - continuous ) random walk @xmath60 and the passage times @xmath61 we stress that the @xmath62 form an increasing sequence of @xmath63-stopping times .",
    "[ le2 ] there is identity @xmath64 for every @xmath42 and , as a consequence , the sequence @xmath65 is i.i.d .",
    "this formula is a close relative of the classical identity of dwass @xcite and would be well known if individuals were enumerated by the usual depth - first search algorithm ( i.e. , without taking care of mutations ) , see , for example , lemma  63 in @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the proof in the present case is similar .",
    "indeed the formula is obvious for @xmath66 , and for @xmath67 , we have on the one hand that @xmath68 by expressing the fact that the predecessor of the second ancestor found by depth - first search with mutations has a rank given by the size of the population generated by eve , that is , eve herself and her descendants . on the other hand",
    ", we must have @xmath69 when @xmath70 , since otherwise the depth - first search algorithm with mutations would explore the second ancestor before having completed the exploration of the entire descent of eve .",
    "this proves the identity for @xmath67 , and the general case then follows by iteration . finally , the last claim is an immediate consequence of lemma [ le1](i ) and the strong markov property .      we can now turn our attention to defining allelic partitions . in this direction , recall that every ancestor has a different type ( i.e. , bears a different allele ) , and thus should be viewed as an initial mutant .",
    "more generally , we call _ mutant _ an individual which either belongs to the initial generation or is the mutant - child of some individual , and then write @xmath71 for the ranks of mutants in the depth - first search algorithm with mutations . for example , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 in the situation depicted by figure [ fig1 ] . the upshot of this algorithm is that the set of individuals that bear the same allele as the @xmath77th mutant @xmath78 corresponds precisely to the integer interval @xmath79 . in this direction , it is therefore natural to introduce for every @xmath80 the @xmath77th _ allelic cluster _ @xmath81 that is , @xmath82 is the finite sequence of the numbers of clone - children and mutant - children of the individuals bearing the same allele as the @xmath77th mutant . the sequence @xmath83 encodes the allelic partition of the entire population .",
    "each allelic cluster @xmath82 is naturally endowed with a structure of rooted planar tree which is induced by the galton  watson process .",
    "more precisely , the latter is encoded via the usual depth - first search algorithm by the sequence @xmath84 ; in particular the @xmath77th mutant @xmath78 is viewed as the root ( i.e. , ancestor ) of the cluster @xmath82 . in other words , the depth - first search algorithm with mutations for the galton ",
    "watson process induces precisely the usual depth - first search applied to the forest of allelic clusters viewed as a sequence of planar rooted trees .",
    "we also stress that the initial galton ",
    "watson process can be recovered from the allelic partition @xmath85 .",
    "indeed , the previous observation shows how to construct the portion of the genealogical tree corresponding to the allelic cluster generated by an initial mutant , and the latter also contains the information which is needed to identify the mutant - children of the first kind .",

    "a classical application of the ballot theorem shows that the conditional distribution of @xmath213 given @xmath214 and @xmath215 is the same as that of @xmath216 conditioned on @xmath217 and @xmath218 .",
    "then note that @xmath219 and an application of the ballot theorem ( much in the same way as in the proof of theorem [ t1 ] ) shows that the probability of that event equals @xmath220 theorem [ t1](ii ) completes the proof .",
    "next , we normalize the size @xmath221 of each cluster by the size @xmath168 of the total population ( recall we focus on the descent of a single ancestor , namely eve ) , and write @xmath222 for the sequence which is obtained by ranking the ratios @xmath223 in the decreasing order .",
    "so @xmath224 is a proper partition of the unit mass , in the sense that it is given by a ranked sequence of positive real numbers with sum @xmath9 .",
    "the space of mass partitions ( possibly with infinitely many strictly positive terms and sum less than @xmath9 ) is endowed with the supremum distance , which yields a compact metric space ; see section 2.1 in @xcite for details .",

    "for the sake of simplicity , we shall focus on the case when the number of clone - children @xmath163 and the number of mutant - children @xmath164 are independent , although it seems likely that our argument should also apply to more general situations .",

    "thus the assumption of independence between @xmath163 and @xmath164 enables us to ignore the conditioning on @xmath261 .",
    "finally , it should be clear that the exponential tilting does not affect such a conditional law , in the sense that the sequence @xmath259 has the same distribution under @xmath262 as under @xmath263 .",
    "we then estimate the distribution of the size of the eve cluster under @xmath248 , which is given again according to the dwass formula @xcite by @xmath264 recall that , by assumption , @xmath163 is critical with variance @xmath265 under @xmath248 , so an application of gnedenko s local central limit theorem gives @xmath266    putting the pieces together , we get that the conditional distribution of @xmath254 given @xmath214 and @xmath215 is the same as that obtained from an i.i.d . sequence @xmath267 by ranking in the decreasing order and conditioning on @xmath268 , where @xmath269 an application of corollary 2.2 in @xcite completes the proof of our claim .",

    "we now conclude this work by discussing a natural example .",
    "specifically , we suppose that the distribution of @xmath304 is the same for all @xmath14 . for the sake of simplicity , we assume also that @xmath305 and @xmath306 .",

    "theorem 2.3.1 of @xcite implies in this setting that the initial galton  watson forest associated with the @xmath14th population model , converges in law after a suitable renormalization to the brownian forest , whereas proposition  [ p2 ] of the present work shows that the allelic forest renormalized in the same way , converges in law to the forest generated by a brownian motion with drift  @xmath314.=1    this provides an explanation to the rather intriguing relation which identifies two seemingly different fragmentation processes : the fragmentation process constructed by aldous and pitman @xcite by logging the continuum random tree according to a poisson point process on its skeleton , and the fragmentation process constructed in @xcite by splitting the unit interval at instants when a brownian excursion with negative drift reaches a new infimum .",
    "it is interesting to mention that schweinsberg @xcite already pointed at several applications of the ( continuous ) ballot theorem in this framework .",
    "more generally , the transformation @xmath315 of lvy processes with no negative jumps also appeared in an article by miermont @xcite on certain eternal additive coalescents , whereas aldous and pitman @xcite showed that the latter arise asymptotically from independent pruning of certain sequences of birthday trees .",
