    "thermal models of hadron production serve us as the basic tool to obtain general information about the properties of matter produced in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite . the successes of such models in description of different collision processes indicate typically that the produced matter is well thermalised and exhibits collective behavior .",
    "this , in turn , suggests the formation of the equilibrated system of quarks and gluons at earlier stages of the collisions .",
    "the newest lhc data on hadron production indicates that the most common thermal approach , based on the chemical and thermal equilibration assumption , fails to describe the ratio of protons to pions  @xcite .",
    "the mean multiplicities of protons and anti - protons also deviate from the fit for about three standard deviations  @xcite .",
    "in addition , most of the hydrodynamic calculations , that have been successfully used to reproduce the harmonic flow coefficients , have problems with the correct predictions for very low transverse - momentum spectra of pions  @xcite .    in our previous works",
    "@xcite we have demonstrated that these two problems may be solved by the assumption that matter produced in heavy - ion collisions at the lhc energies is formed out of chemical equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "one of the predictions of the chemical non - equilibrium model is that the pion abundances are characterized by the non - zero value of the chemical potential which is very close to the critical value for the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) .",
    "this suggests a possible onset of bec at the lhc energies .",
    "the recent analysis of two- and three - pion correlations done by alice collaboration  @xcite shows an intriguing result that a coherent fraction in charged pion emission may reach 23@xmath1 .",
    "the main aim of our present work is to determine quantitatively the amount of particles in condensate at different centralities using mean multiplicities and spectra of the particles .",
    "the fact that the pion chemical potential is very close to its critical value requires that thermal analyses in this case should be performed in a more careful way with the explicit treatment of the local zero - momentum state @xcite .",
    "as the inclusion of the pion ground state effects is relatively easy in the analyses of the ratios of hadronic abundances , a fully covariant framework describing local formation of the condensate in an expanding medium is not at hand .",
    "the formulation of such a framework requires that the cooper - frye formula is generalized in a very special way . in this work",
    "we demonstrate how this can be achieved for boost - invariant and cylindrically symmetric systems .",
    "we make the corresponding changes in the previously used by us share  @xcite and therminator  @xcite codes .",
    "the hadronic data are analyzed within three possible scenarios : using the full equilibrium model ( eq ) , the chemical non - equilibrium model ( neq ) that have been used in  @xcite , and the newly developed chemical non - equilibrium model with bose - einstein condensate   ( bec )  .",
    "we include all available lhc data on pb+pb collisions at @xmath2  tev  @xcite in our study using the modified share and use the modified therminator in order to check the effect of bec on the pion spectra at low transverse - momenta  @xcite .",
    "we also discuss in greater detail the effects which the data on neutral pion production may have on our results .",
    "our comparisons between different thermal frameworks indicate the plausibility of pion condensation in heavy - ion collisions at the lhc .    the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sect : bec ]",
    "we describe the role of the ground state and the difference between eq , neq and bec models . in section  [",
    "sect : fitstrateg ] we explain the method of our analysis",
    ". sections  [ sect : ratios ] and  [ sect : bec - therminator ] show the results of the analysis of mean multiplicities and particle spectra , correspondingly .",
    "section  [ sect : conclusions ] concludes the paper .",
    "calculating particle multiplicities in a non - interacting quantum gas , one changes the summation over discrete momentum levels by the integration over the continuous spectrum @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the degeneracy of the @xmath5-th momentum state , @xmath6 is the system temperature , @xmath7 is the mass of particles , and @xmath8 is the chemical potential . the integral over space coordinates gives the volume of the system @xmath9 , and the factor @xmath10 appears since we use the natural units where @xmath11 and @xmath12 . for simplicity",
    ", we do not specify the physical character of the chemical potential @xmath8 at the moment and consider only one type of particles .    if the chemical potential approaches the value of the particle mass , the integrand in the second line of eq .",
    "( [ v1 ] ) stays constant for @xmath13 , because the singularity of the denominator is cancelled by the integration measure @xmath14 .",
    "however , the first term in the sum over quantum levels becomes infinite in the limit @xmath15 at @xmath16 @xmath17 therefore , at the onset of bec , when @xmath18 , one should keep the summation over the low momentum states and start the integration in ( [ v1 ] ) at @xmath19 .",
    "one can show , however , that in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath20 , one may separate the @xmath16 term only and start the integration from zero  @xcite , namely @xmath21 the degeneracy of the zero level is the same as that of the continuous spectrum , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the particle spin .      in the case of a hadron - resonance gas",
    "the above simple picture becomes more complicated  one should include : the sum over all existing hadron states , the integral over the mass spectrum of broad resonances , and the decays of resonances defined by their branching ratios .",
    "in addition , the chemical potential is different for each particle type @xmath24 . in the case of the eq model ,",
    "the chemical potential becomes a linear combination of the particle s electric , @xmath25 , baryon , @xmath26 , and strange , @xmath27 , charges @xmath28 the chemical potentials @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the same in the whole system .",
    "they control the conservation of electric charge , baryon number , and strangeness . in the midrapidity region at the lhc these quantities are negligible , so it is reasonable to assume that @xmath32 the charge conservation is connected with the conservation of the _ difference _ of the quark and antiquark numbers .",
    "however , a fast expansion and cooling of the quark - gluon plasma may lead to the effective conservation of the _ sum _ of quarks and antiquarks  @xcite .",
    "it can happen if the hadronization is so fast , that the quarks do not have enough time to annihilate and lower their abundances to the equilibrium values at the chemical freeze - out temperature .",
    "this leads to the appearance of additional non - equilibrium chemical potential @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are numbers of light ( @xmath36 ) quarks and antiquarks , while @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the numbers of strange quarks and antiquarks in the @xmath24th hadron .",
    "for example , the non - equilibrium chemical potentials for pions , protons , kaons , and @xmath39 s read : @xmath40 we neglect the contributions from heavier quarks , because they are suppressed by the boltzmann factor .",
    "the non - equilibrium chemical potentials may be encoded in the fugacity factors of the form @xmath41 as a matter of fact , the non - equilibrium hypothesis of hadron production at freeze - out was originally proposed in terms of @xmath42 s  @xcite , therefore , we will follow the tradition and use @xmath43 and @xmath44 instead of @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "we have introduced the condensation term @xmath47 given by eq .",
    "( [ replace3 ] ) in the latest version of share  @xcite .",
    "the calculations done in this way are denoted below as the bec case .",
    "there are several technical issues that we have to address now .",
    "different particles are measured in different centrality bins .",
    "this leads to problems with the interpretation of the data .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite solved this problem by redistributing heavy strange particles in smaller centrality bins , in which light particles such as pions are measured .",
    "however , we have found that this strategy introduces an uncertainty in the thermal analyses , which leads to large errors for the output parameters , especially for @xmath43 and @xmath44",
    ".    therefore , herein we do the opposite and merge the particles measured with the finer centrality steps into larger centrality sets at which strange particles are measured .",
    "this gives us six centrality intervals : , , , , , and .",
    "the corresponding errors are recalculated following the standard procedure of error propagation .",
    "the experiment provides both multiplicities ( strictly speaking the rapidity densities ) and particle ratios .",
    "some authors prefer to fit particle ratios instead of multiplicities , in order to have fewer number of parameters and to get rid of the system s volume",
    ". however , one should be careful with this procedure , especially for the non - equilibrium models , because with given @xmath48 multiplicities one may construct @xmath49 ratios .",
    "this gives quite substantial number of ratios for large @xmath48 , which are correlated .    in practice ,",
    "one usually restricts oneself to a smaller and experimentally available set of ratios , and thus studies only a sub - domain of the whole system .",
    "this strategy affects the results , in particular for the neq models , where each particle has its own pre - factor @xmath42  ( [ pre - factor ] ) .",
    "for example , the multiplicity of protons is approximately proportional to @xmath50 , while that of pions to @xmath51 .",
    "therefore the ratio of protons to pions will give us the factor @xmath43 , which is much less sensitive to the change of @xmath43 than the mean multiplicities of protons and pions .",
    "the ratio of lambda to kaon cancels the information on strangeness , @xmath52 , and gives us as much information as proton to pion ratio , etc .",
    "therefore , even if one takes all @xmath53 ratios , one may get different temperatures and other parameters for the same set of @xmath48 particles .",
    "another important aspect of the analysis is that alice measures only the rapidity densities .",
    "below , we argue that eq .",
    "( [ replace3 ] ) can be transformed in this case to the form @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the volume of the produced particles per unit rapidity .",
    "note that the volume does not cancel in the ratios of the rapidity densities in the case with the condensate included .",
    "the bec model gives typically a very good fit for all observed particles .",
    "however , the calculated number of the not yet measured @xmath56 mesons is extremely large .",
    "this is so , because the fit suggests a high value of @xmath43 , at which the neutral pions , as the lightest particles , condense first .",
    "this behaviour suggests that one should make a reasonable estimate of the @xmath56 multiplicity and use it as an input in the bec fit .",
    "the isospin symmetry of strong interactions suggests that the number of @xmath56 s must be the same as the number of positively or negatively charged pions .",
    "although the isospin symmetry is in fact slightly broken ( in particular , @xmath56 is lighter than @xmath57 ) we neglect this effect in order to get a lower bound for the amount of condensate , and use the constraint @xmath58 equation  ( [ pi0 ] ) represents an estimate of a possible production rate .",
    "the error bars are recalculated as follows @xmath59 since the experimental errors for the @xmath60 and @xmath61 mean multiplicities are practically the same , we obtain almost the same error bars for @xmath56 .",
    "we note that it is much more difficult to measure @xmath56 s than charged pions . at present",
    ", the spectrum for @xmath62  mev is known only .",
    "it gives just about @xmath63 of all expected @xmath56 s . in the @xmath64 range where both @xmath57 and @xmath56 are measured",
    ", the latter has about twice bigger relative errors .",
    "the error bars for @xmath56-s also increase fast , while going from high to low @xmath64 in the existing data  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we think that ( [ pi0err ] ) is a reasonable estimate .",
    "we perform our analysis using the rapidity densities of @xmath57 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath39 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 . in order to include the effect of the neutral pions on the fits",
    ", we also include the estimate based on eqs .",
    "( [ pi0 ] )  and  ( [ pi0err ] ) .",
    "this gives us 14 data points for the centralities , , , , , and 10 data points for the centrality bin , where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are not measured .",
    "we do not include the short - living @xmath72  @xcite  in this way we may check if it follows the pattern obtained for other long - living particles . by doing so we further examine the applicability of the single freeze - out concept , see our discussion in  @xcite .",
    "our results are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : v - t ] , [ fig : gq - gs ]  and  [ fig : chi2-datafit ] .",
    "the volume determined from the fits is practically the same for the neq and bec models , because the number of particles in the ground state appears to be relatively small .",
    "the eq volume is larger , because @xmath73 makes the system denser in neq and bec , compared to eq .",
    "interestingly , the explicit treatment of the ground state lowers the gap in temperature between equilibrium and non - equilibrium models .",
    "these two versions of the model even coincide for the peripheral collisions , as it was shown before in  @xcite .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : chi2-datafit ] shows that the @xmath74 fit is much better for bec than for eq .",
    "even the larger numbers of degrees of freedom in eq ( @xmath75 = 12 for @xmath76 and @xmath75 = 8 for @xmath77   in eq , versus @xmath78 and @xmath79 in bec , respectively ) do not help to decrease the @xmath80 values .",
    "the agreement with the data for individual particles is also significantly better for bec than for eq .",
    "for example , the @xmath72 resonance , which was not included in the fit , deviates from the data by more than @xmath81 in most central collisions in eq , similarly as in ref .",
    "@xcite , while it agrees with the data within @xmath82 in bec for each centrality . the successful fit of the short living @xmath72 with the parameters obtained for long living particles is a strong argument in favor of the single - freeze - out approximation .    the values of @xmath80 even drop below unity in bec , which means that the experimental errors are probably too large . to check this behaviour , we calculated the @xmath80 contours and found that the minimum of @xmath80 is very shallow in bec .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : chi2-datafit ] shows the @xmath83 deviation from the points with the best fit in the @xmath84 plane for bec .",
    "the centrality increases from lower to higher temperatures , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : v - t ] .",
    "one may see that the increase of @xmath80 by 10% determines the area that covers a substantial part of the region marked by the error bars .",
    "this is so because there is a sudden rise in the values of @xmath80 for increasing @xmath43 .",
    "this effect elongates the contours towards smaller values of @xmath43 .",
    "one may also notice an anti - correlation between @xmath43 and @xmath6 .",
    "the number of particles in the condensate in eq , neq and bec models can be calculated using eq .",
    "( [ n0 ] ) and our results obtained with this formula are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : rcond ] .",
    "the grey bands give the upper and lower bounds on the amount of condensate in bec .",
    "the width of the bands is determined by the values of @xmath6 and @xmath43 taken along the contours shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi2-datafit ] ( other parameters are taken as the optimal ) .",
    "the condensate rate in the neq model is not shown , as it is very large .",
    "it means that using neq model , one should always take into account the ground state effect . otherwise , the obtained @xmath43 and @xmath44 would be too high , while temperature too small .    in bec",
    "the condensate rate is @xmath85 in the most central collisions and @xmath86 in peripheral collisions ( with a sudden increase to @xmath87 in the most peripheral collisions ) .",
    "the plots for @xmath56 and @xmath57 are similar , because of the isospin symmetry that we demand with the use of eqs .",
    "( [ pi0 ] ) and ( [ pi0err ] ) .",
    "the upper bound is higher for @xmath56 in the most central collisions , because temperature is lower there and the difference in masses of @xmath56 and @xmath57 becomes more important .",
    "the increase of the pion condensate contribution with centrality in the bec model is unexpected , because @xmath43 and therefore @xmath88 decrease with centrality .",
    "however , it has been observed already before @xcite that for smaller volumes the ratio of particles in the condensate increases if the system s temperature is sufficiently high .",
    "therefore , the decrease of volume may produce the increase in the condensate rate .",
    "we also note that the ratio of the @xmath56 and @xmath57 number in the zero momentum level ( neglected in eq calculations ) , @xmath89 to the total number of @xmath56 and @xmath57-s also increases for more than @xmath83 . the number of particles in the ground state @xmath90 in ( [ ncond - eq ] ) for all centralities , while @xmath91 decreases from about @xmath92 to @xmath93 at the most peripheral collisions , see  @xcite for the @xmath57 data .",
    "therefore the ratio rises from @xmath94 to @xmath83 .",
    "it means that the ground state should be included for the analysis of very peripheral heavy - ion or proton - proton collisions even in equilibrium models .",

    "<S> we analyse in detail the possibility of bose - einstein condensation of pions produced in heavy - ion collisions at the beam energy @xmath0 = 2.76 tev . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is based on the chemical non - equilibrium thermal model of hadron production which has been generalised to include separately the contribution from the local zero - momentum state . in order to study both the hadronic multiplicities and the transverse - momentum spectra </S>",
    "<S> , we use the cracow freeze - out model which parameterises the flow and space - time geometry of the system at freeze - out in a very economic way . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis indicates that about 5% of all pions may form the bose - einstein condensate . </S>"
