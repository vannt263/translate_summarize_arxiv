    "head - on beam  beam compensation was first proposed as a four - beam e@xmath0e@xmath1e@xmath0e@xmath1 scheme for coppelia  @xcite and implemented for dispositif de collisions dans ligloo ( dci )  @xcite .",
    "the dci experience , however , fell short of expectations ; luminosities with two , three , or four beams were about the same .",
    "the shortfall is generally attributed to coherent beam  beam instabilities  @xcite , and head - on beam  beam compensation has not been tested again since .    nevertheless , various proposals have been made , such as for the ssc  @xcite , tevatron  @xcite , lhc  @xcite , and b - factories  @xcite . in hadron colliders ,",
    "the compensation can be achieved by colliding positively charged beams with a negatively charged low - energy electron beam , in a device usually referred to as an electron lens .",
    "doing so avoids the coherent instabilities seen in dci , as the electron beam will not couple back to the hadron beam , except for single - pass effects ; these can be significant  @xcite and may require the addition of a transverse damper in rhic .",
    "two electron lenses were installed in the tevatron  @xcite , where they were routinely used as a gap cleaner , but not for head - on beam  beam compensation .",
    "the tevatron experience is valuable for several reasons : ( i ) the reliability of the technology was demonstrated , as no store was ever lost because of the lenses  @xcite ; ( ii ) the tune shift of selected bunches due to pacman effects was corrected , leading to lifetime improvements  @xcite ; ( iii ) the sensitivity to positioning errors , transverse profile shape , and electron beam current fluctuations was explored  @xcite ; ( iv ) experiments with a gaussian profile electron beam were performed ; and ( v ) a hollow electron beam was tested in a collimation scheme  @xcite . for the design of the rhic electron lenses we have benefited greatly from the tevatron experience .",
    "we have also drawn on the expertise gained in the construction and operation of an electron beam ion source ( ebis ) at brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl )  @xcite , which is a device similar to an electron lens but with a different purpose .",
    "in rhic there are two head - on beam  beam interactions at interaction points ip6 and ip8 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ov ] ) , as well as four long - range beam  beam interactions with large separation ( about 10  mm ) between the beams at the other interaction points .",
    "the luminosity is limited by the head - on effect in polarized proton operation  @xcite , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : bunch12 ] .",
    "bunches with two collisions experience a larger proton loss throughout the store than bunches with only one collision .",
    "the enhanced loss is particularly strong at the beginning of a store .",
    "beam effects in other hadron colliders are reported in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we consider the partial indirect compensation of the head - on beam  beam effect with one electron lens in each ring . together with intensity and emittance upgrades  @xcite , our goal is to approximately double the luminosity over what can be achieved without these upgrades .",
    "this article gives a summary of previous studies and progress reports on head - on beam  beam compensation in rhic with electron lenses  @xcite , updated with the latest available information .",
    "if a collision of a proton beam with another proton beam is followed by a collision with an electron beam , the head - on beam  beam kick can in principle be reversed . for simplicity",
    "we consider only the horizontal plane and beams with a gaussian transverse distribution .",

    "therefore , if the following three conditions are met , the beam  beam kicks are cancelled exactly .    1",
    ".   the ion beam and electron beam produce the same amplitude - dependent force by having the same effective charge and profile .",
    "the phase advance between the two beam  beam collisions is a multiple of @xmath26 in both transverse planes .",
    "there are no nonlinearities between the two collisions .    in practice",
    "the above can be achieved only approximately .",
    "deviations from condition 1 include :    * an electron current that does not match the proton bunch intensity ; * a non - gaussian electron beam profile ( assuming that the proton beam transverse profile is gaussian ) ; * an electron beam size that differs from the proton beam size ; * time - dependence of the electron and proton beam parameters .    deviations from condition 2 include :    * a phase advance @xmath27 between the head - on collision and the electron lens ; * long bunches , i.e.  @xmath28 .",
    "deviations from condition 3 include :    * lattice sextupoles and octupoles , as well as multipole error between the head - on collision and the electron lens .",
    "tolerances were studied extensively in simulations and reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , and bunch length effects have been investigated in refs .",
    "the tevatron experience also provides tolerances for positioning errors , transverse shape and size mismatches , and electron current variations .",
    "we give the tolerances for all devices below .",
    "we plan to compensate for only one of the two head - on collisions in rhic , since a full compensation would lead to a small tune spread and could give rise to instabilities .",
    "in designing the electron lens , we were aiming for a technically feasible implementation that would come as close as possible to the ideal compensation scheme outlined above .",
    "in addition , a major design consideration was ease of commissioning and operation .",
    "our goal is a commissioning that is largely parasitic to the rhic operation for physics .",

    "since both proton beams are round in the beam  beam interactions ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) , we also require that @xmath52 at the electron lens location , and require matched transverse proton and electron beam profiles , i.e.  that the electron beam profile is also gaussian with @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the condition @xmath55 limits the electron lens locations to the space between the dx magnets ; in these locations the rhic lattice also has a small dispersion .",
    "the tolerances for the main solenoid field straightness and for the relative beam alignment are easier to meet with a larger proton beam .",
    "a larger beam is also less susceptible to coherent instabilities  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath56-function at ip10 can not be larger than 10  m at 250  gev proton energy without modifications to the buses and feedthroughs of the ir10 superconducting magnets .",
    "such modifications are currently not under consideration because of costs , but could be implemented if coherent instabilities occur and can not be mitigated by other means .    with a fully magnetized electron beam , the beam size @xmath57 in the main solenoid is given by its size at the cathode , @xmath58 , together with the solenoid fields @xmath59 at the cathode and @xmath60 in the main solenoid as @xmath61 .",
    "for technological and cost reasons , the field @xmath60 can not be much larger than 6  t , and a strong field makes a correction of the field straightness more difficult .",
    "the field @xmath59 has to be large enough to suppress space charge effects . with the limits in the @xmath59 and @xmath60 fields and a given beam size @xmath57 , the electron beam size and current density at the cathode follow , and they must be technically feasible . unlike the tevatron electron lenses",
    ", we use a dc electron beam to avoid the noise possibly introduced through the high - voltage switches .",

    "we have installed four phase - shifter power supplies for both transverse planes of both rings so that the betatron phase between ip8 and the electron lenses in ir10 can be adjusted . to have @xmath62 in both planes of both rings , it is also necessary to change the integer tunes from @xmath63 to @xmath64 in the blue ring and from @xmath63 to @xmath65 in the yellow ring to find a solution . with the new lattices ,",
    "higher luminosities were reached in 2013 than in previous years , but the polarization was lower .",
    "the lower polarization is still being investigated and may not have resulted from the new lattices .",
    "other lattice options are also under study : ( i ) a solution was found for the yellow ring that maintains the integer tunes of @xmath63 and has the correct phase advances ; ( ii ) the phase advance of a multiple of @xmath26 may also be realized between ip6 and the electron lenses .",
