    "it is widely believed that the spin - independent coulomb interaction and the pauli exclusion principle can generate ferromagnetism in itinerant electron systems .",
    "one of the motivations to study the hubbard model has been to establish and understand the generation of ferromagnetism in simplified situations taking account of these effects @xcite .",
    "mielke @xcite and tasaki @xcite , independently , presented hubbard models which exhibit saturated ferromagnetism for certain electron numbers when the coulomb interaction @xmath0 is positive .",
    "these models have a common feature that the single electron spectra contain dispersionless bands , and are called flat - band models . in @xcite and @xcite , tasaki also discovered hubbard models exhibiting ferromagnetism which models are nonsingular in the sense that both the density of states and the coulomb interaction are finite . recently",
    "tanaka and ueda succeeded in proving the existence of saturated ferromagnetism in a hubbard model obtained by adding extra hopping terms to mielke s flat - band model on the kagom lattice @xcite .",
    "although the flat band hubbard models are singular and not physically realistic , their study can be a basis of more realistic results about ferromagnetism .",
    "it is therefore important to find out which flat - band models exhibit ferromagnetism .",
    "although an abstract criterion was presented by mielke @xcite , we still do not know precise class of models which satisfy the criterion .    ) and the gray dots are the internal sites ( in @xmath1 ) .",
    "tasaki s model has one internal cite in each cell while our has two . ]    in this paper , we follow tasaki s construction of his flat band models , and construct a new class of hubbard models in arbitrary dimensions with finite @xmath0 and finite - range hopping .",
    "we prove that the models exhibit ferromagnetism in their ground states at two distinct electron numbers .",
    "the difference between tasaki s original model and ours can easily be seen from fig.[onedim ] where the simplest one - dimensional versions of the models are illustrated .",
    "tasaki s model has one `` internal site '' ( gray dot in the figure ) in each unit cell , while ours has two .",
    "this difference in lattice structure makes our model to have different `` exchange mechanism '' where a single - electron state localized at each pair of internal sites play an important role .",
    "see section [ end ] for more details .",
    "we have thus found that a extension of tasaki s construction lead to a new class of models exhibiting ferromagnetism .",
    "we hope this study will shed light on general structure of flat - band ferromagnetism .",
    "in the original flat - band models by tasaki @xcite , the basic cell in the lattice @xmath2 consists of a single internal site and some external sites . in our new models ,",
    "the basic cell consists of two internal sites and some external sites .",

    "first we discuss the mechanisms that generate ferromagnetism in the present and tasaki s models . in tasaki s models , electrons in the lowest flat - band may be regarded ( in the basis corresponding to the @xmath75 operators ) as almost localized at external sites .",
    "roughly speaking , a small overlap of the wave functions at an internal site generates `` exchange interaction '' which leads to ferromagnetism as in fig.[ferro ] ( a ) . in the situation of theorem [ tfo : main ] ,",
    "the picture is almost the same in our models .",
    "the electrons are almost localized at external sites and overlap at intermediate sites as in fig.[ferro ] ( b ) . in the situation of theorem [ tft : main ] , however , the picture is essentially different from that in tasaki s model .",
    "each electron in the lowest flat bands is either almost localized at an external site or localized at a pair of internal sites .",
    "the basic `` exchange interaction '' involves three electrons as in the fig.[ferro ] ( c ) .",
    "this is why the proof of theorem [ tft : main ] required a new technique .",
    "( b )  in the case of theorem [ tfo : main ] , overlap of two states almost localized at neighboring external sites generate ferromagnetism just as in tasaki s flat - band model .",
    "( c ) in the case of theorem [ tft : main ] , the exchange interaction also involves a state localized at two internal sites . ]",
    "secondly let us discuss the possibility of further extending tasaki s construction .",
    "a natural question is whether one can treat models with three or more internal sites . as for results corresponding to theorem [ tfo : main ] , it is obvious that our proof ( and tasaki s original proof ) automatically extends to such models . but results corresponding to theorem [ tft : main ] , which involves a new exchange mechanism , are much more delicate .",
    "we suspect that a new idea is required to cover the general cases .",
    "part of the present work was done when the author was at department of physics , gakushuin university .",
