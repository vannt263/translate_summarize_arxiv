    "massive stars are key to understanding many physical phenomena in the galaxy ; nevertheless , their formation process is still poorly understood .",
    "a prime manifestation of recent massive star formation is the presence of an hiiregion surrounding the young massive star(s ) .",
    "the range of sizes and densities of these hii  regions reflects both the original conditions of the star - forming environment and the later evolution of the ionized regions .",
    "the smallest ( @xmath0  pc ) and densest ( @xmath1  @xmath2 ) hii  regions , the so - called hypercompact ( hc ) hii  regions ( e.g. ,  kurtz 2005 ) , are associated with the earliest stages of evolution .",
    "hc  hii  regions are particularly interesting in the study of massive star formation because they are so small that we can assume they harbor only a _",
    "single star _ ( or a binary system ) , in contrast to ultracompact ( uc ) or compact hiiregions ( with sizes @xmath3  pc ) which usually harbor clusters of massive stars ( e.g. ,  kurtz 2000 ; hoare et al .",
    "additionally , recent work ( keto 2007 ) suggests that o stars form gradually via accretion through an hc  hii  region onto intermediate mass b stars .",
    "thus , the study of hc  hii  regions is important to understand the formation of massive stars .",
    "however , only a handful of hc  hiiregions are known , and a larger sample is needed for detailed studies with good statistics to determine the properties of this very early stage of massive star formation .    the @xmath4@xmath5 @xmath6 line of methanol at 6.7  ghz is the strongest of the class  ii methanol masers .",
    "theoretical and observational studies strongly suggest that this maser line traces very early stages of massive star formation  often prior to the formation of an uc  hii  region ( e.g. , minier et al .",
    "2001 ; cragg et al .",
    "2005 ; ellingsen 2006 ; schnee & carpenter 2009 ) . unlike water ,",
    "oh or class  i methanol masers , that have also been found toward low - mass star forming regions , class  ii methanol masers seem to be unique to _ massive _ young stellar objects ( ysos ) .",
    "thus , class  ii methanol masers are excellent candidates to search for hc  hii  regions .",
    "the arecibo methanol maser galactic plane survey ( amgps ; pandian et al .",
    "2007 ) is the most sensitive blind survey for 6.7  ghz methanol masers carried out to date . by using the 305  m arecibo radio telescope ,",
    "the amgps covered an area of 18.2  deg@xmath7 between galactic longitudes of 35  and 54 , detecting a total of 86 sources .",
    "thus , this catalog is an excellent starting point to look for new hc  hii  region candidates .",
    "hc  hii  regions have small sizes ( @xmath8  pc ) , high densities ( @xmath9  @xmath2 ) , high emission measures ( @xmath10  pc  @xmath11 ) , steep spectral indices ( @xmath12 ) , and broad ( @xmath13  km  s@xmath14 ) radio recombination lines ( e.g. ,  gaume et al .",
    "1995 ; kurtz 2000 ; sewilo et al .",
    "the turnover frequency , separating the optically thin ( @xmath15 ) and thick ( @xmath16 ) regimes is usually between 20 and 40  ghz for hc  hiiregions ( substantially higher than the typical 5  ghz for uc  hii  regions ) .",
    "hence , hc  hii  regions are faint at wavelengths longer than 6  cm , but their intensities increase at shorter wavelengths . in order to select those amgps sources with the highest probability of harboring an hc  hii  region , we developed the following selection criteria : _",
    "i ) _ _ no 6  cm  /  20  cm counterparts _ , we searched the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss , condon et al .",
    "1998 ) , and the magpis and cornish surveys ( helfand et al .  2006 ; purcell et al .  2008 ) for emission at 20 and 6  cm toward all the amgps methanol maser sources . by rejecting sources with 20 or 6  cm emission",
    "we eliminate star - forming regions with more - developed , lower - density hii  regions , detectable at longer wavelengths ; and _ ii ) _ _ mid - ir emission _ , we searched the msx ( price et al .",
    "2001 ) and mipsgal ( carey et al . 2009 ) catalogs for emission at mid - infrared wavelengths toward those sources with no 20  cm/6  cm emission .",
    "essentially all sources show emission in the mipsgal 24  @xmath17 m band ( in some cases with pixels blanked due to saturation ) , but only half of the sources were detected by msx .",
    "this is primarly because of the significantly better sensitivity of _ spitzer _ compared to msx .",
    "however , msx detections suggest the presence of a relatively warm young stellar object , which may be more likely to host a young hii  region .",
    "we hence rejected sources that have no msx detection .",
    "thus all our targets exceed the msx detection limit of @xmath180.3  jy at 8  @xmath17 m .",
    "of the 86 methanol masers in the amgps catalog , 24 fulfill these selection criteria .",
    "the peak flux densities of the selected masers range from 0.27  jy to 17  jy , and their luminosities ( taken from pandian et al .",
    "2009 ) range from @xmath19 to @xmath20  @xmath21 , covering the full range of flux densities and luminosities reported in the amgps catalog .",
    "thus , we can test for correlations between the maser properties and the presence of hc  hii  regions .",
    "our sample was observed with the evla ( see perley et al .",
    "2011 ) of the nrao in the continuum at 3.6  cm and 1.3  cm .",
    "the observations were made during the shared - risk phase in 2010 april and june ; the array was in the d configuration . owing to missing scans during the shared - risk observing",
    "not all sources were observed at both frequencies : 19 regions were observed at 3.6  cm , and the entire sample ( 24 regions ) at 1.3  cm .",
    "the new wide - band interferometric digital architecture ( widar ) correlator provided continuum observations of 128  mhz bandwidth with two polarizations , resulting in an effective bandwidth of 256  mhz . on -",
    "source integration times were about 6  minutes at 3.6  cm and 10  minutes at 1.3  cm .",
    "flux and bandpass calibration were performed by observing the quasar 3c48 , with an adopted flux density of 3.15  jy at 3.6  cm and 1.12  jy at 1.3  cm .",
    "amplitude and phase calibrations were achieved by monitoring the quasars j1851@xmath220035 and j1922@xmath221530 , resulting in an rms phase of 5  and 50  at 3.6  cm and 1.3  cm , respectively .",
    "data were calibrated using the casa package , following the standard guidelines for continuum reduction . the calibrated _",
    "uv_-data sets were exported in fits format , and imaged using the nrao package aips .",
    "images were made using a variety of weightings , and tapering the 1.3  cm _ uv_-data to improve the sensitivity to low - surface - brightness objects .",
    "typical synthesized beams were @xmath23  and @xmath24  at 3.6  cm and 1.3  cm , respectively , with rms noise levels of @xmath25  @xmath17@xmath26  and @xmath27  @xmath17@xmath26 .",
    "radio continuum emission is seen in all the regions . at 3.6",
    "cm we detect continuum sources in all 19 observed fields , while at 1.3  cm we detect continuum emission in 10 out of 24 fields .",
    "a total of 49 radio continuum sources were identified in the 24 fields of our sample ( 2 out of 49 sources were detected at 1.3  cm in fields that were not observed at 3.6  cm ) .",
    "however , not all the sources are found close to the methanol maser emission . a complete analysis of all the sources ( including those located far from the maser emission ) with a multi - wavelength ( infrared , submillimeter and centimeter ) analysis will be presented in a forthcoming paper .    in this letter , we focus our attention on the centimeter continuum sources close to the methanol maser emission . in particular , we study the sources detected within the 1.3  cm primary beam ( @xmath28 ) , which is centered ( in most cases ) at the coordinates of the methanol masers reported by pandian et al.(2011 ) . within the 1.3  cm primary beam ,",
    "11 of the 24 fields show radio continuum emission .",
    "thus , the detection rate of centimeter continuum sources close to the maser emission ( @xmath29 ) is around 46% .",
    "a total of 14 sources were detected in these 11 fields .",
    "table  [ t : cmmaser ] lists the 24 regions observed in this study . for regions with a source within the 1.3  cm primary beam we list the position of peak emission ( derived from the 3.6  cm image ) , and the primary beam corrected flux densities at 3.6 and 1.3  cm .",
    "an upper limit of 4 times the rms noise of the map is listed if there is no detection within the 1.3  cm primary beam .",
    "we also list the properties of the 6.7  ghz methanol masers ( peak flux density and luminosity ) from pandian et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2009 ) , as well as the angular and spatial offset between the centimeter continuum sources and the maser spots .",
    "the centimeter continuum emission found close to the masers is typically compact with respect to our synthesized beams of 69 , except for two sources in g38.26@xmath300.20 and g48.99@xmath300.30 , for which we found extended structures that are offset from the maser positions and are partially resolved out at 1.3  cm .",
    "the maximum angular scale that can be recovered by our observations is @xmath31  and @xmath32  at 3.6 and 1.3  cm , respectively .",
    "however , the snapshot nature of the observations make it difficult to properly image large structures . to obtain more accurate estimates of the spectral indices for the compact sources ( see table  [ t : cmmaser ] ) we re - imaged these fields at 3.6 and 1.3  cm using the _",
    "uv_range 328  k@xmath33 .",
    "flux densities from this restricted _ uv_range were used to calculate the spectral indices reported in table  [ t : cmmaser ] .",
    "most of the compact sources show positive spectral indices ( @xmath34 ) , indicative of partially optically thick emission typical of hc  hii  regions and thermal radiojets ( e.g. ,  kurtz 2005 ; rodrguez et al .",
    "a few sources have spectral indices between @xmath35 and @xmath36 , possibly tracing optically thin emission from weak and compact hii  regions ( e.g. ,  snchez - monge et al .",
    "2008 ) , or non - thermal emission as found toward other massive young stellar objects ( e.g. ,  zapata et al .",
    "two sources in our sample were detected only at 1.3  cm : the south - eastern source in g37.55 + 0.19 ( see figure  [ f : cmmaps ] ) and the source in g53.14 + 0.07 . adopting a 4@xmath37 detection limit at 3.6  cm , we can place a lower limit on the spectral index of these sources .",
    "the former has @xmath38 while the latter has @xmath39 .",
    "these large values for the spectral index indicate that the turnover frequency ( from optically thick to optically thin emission ) is greater than 22  ghz , which implies a lower limit to the emission measure of @xmath40  pc  @xmath11 .",
    "these two sources are excellent candidates for hc  hii  regions .",
    "several of the regions we observed were previously studied with the vla at the higher angular resolution of @xmath41  ( pandian et al .",
    "our results are similar to those of pandian et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , although we typically recover more flux in our d - configuration observations .    to describe the morphology and spatial distribution of the emission with respect to the masers ,",
    "we classify the sources into three main groups : _ a ) _ compact sources spatially associated with the methanol maser ( 7/14 , 50% ) , _ b ) _ compact sources offset from the maser ( 2/14 , 14% ) , and _",
    "c ) _ larger ( in some cases , clearly extended ) sources found offset from the maser emission , likely tracing more evolved uc hii  regions ( 5/14 , 36% ) . in figure",
    "[ f : cmmaps ] we show an example of each group .",
    "of the 14 sources detected within the 1.3  cm primary beam ( see section  3 and table  [ t : cmmaser ] ) , seven are found to be coincident ( spatial offset @xmath42  pc ) with a methanol maser .",
    "considering the entire sample of 24 distinct maser sources , 29% of the methanol masers are associated with radio continuum emission with a flux density @xmath43  mjy .",
    "this is consistent with previous work : 10% of the amgps masers has 20  cm nvss counterparts ( pandian et al .",
    "2007b ) , 33% of the torun blind survey ( szymczak et al .",
    "2002 ) shows associated 6  cm emission , and 30% of the amgps sub - sample studied by pandian et al .",
    "( 2010 ) was found to have associated centimeter continuum emission .",
    "it is interesting to note that the sources associated with maser emission are compact and all but one have spectral indices between @xmath44 and @xmath45 with an average value of @xmath46 , indicating the presence of partially optically thick emission . in contrast , centimeter continuum sources found offset ( @xmath47  pc ) from the maser position are generally morphologically more extended and have optically thin emission ( see table  [ t : cmmaser ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with 6.7  ghz methanol masers tracing very early phases of massive star formation .",
    "we do not see any clear correlation between the properties of the centimeter continuum emission and those of the maser emission ( peak flux density or luminosity ) .",
    "however , we caution that our sample is small ; a more extensive survey might show some correlation between the continuum and maser emission .",
    "we determined the physical parameters of the centimeter continuum sources assuming they are ( homogeneous ) hii  regions .",
    "for those sources with optically thin emission ( g38.12@xmath300.24 , g38.92@xmath300.36 , and g42.70@xmath300.15 ) we derive an emission measure of @xmath48@xmath49  @xmath11  pc , characteristic of uc  hiiregions ( e.g. ,  wood & churchwell 1989 ) , and an ionizing photon flux of @xmath50  s@xmath14 ( indicating ionization from b0 or b0.5 stars , panagia 1973 ) . for sources with optically thick emission , we performed a similar analysis to that done by pandian et al .",
    "( 2010 ) . using the altenhoff et al .",
    "( 1960 ) approximation , the free - free optical depth can be related to the emission measure , @xmath51 , as @xmath52~ \\bigg[\\frac{t_\\mathrm{e}}{\\mathrm{k}}\\bigg]^{-1.35}~ \\bigg[\\frac{\\nu}{\\mathrm{ghz}}\\bigg]^{-2.1};\\ ] ] here we assume an electron temperature of @xmath53  k. given that the spectral index is @xmath54 , and considering homogeneous hii  regions , the emission measure should be @xmath55  @xmath11  pc ( with the limiting case when @xmath56 at a frequency of 22.46  ghz ) . in the optically thick regime , we can relate the flux density and the solid angle of the source , @xmath57 , as @xmath58 with @xmath59 ) the black body function .",
    "the sizes derived for our compact sources range between 1 and 10  mpc .",
    "thus , the centimeter sources we find associated with class  ii methanol masers have optical depths and emission measures typical of hc  hii  regions .",
    "higher resolution observations are needed to determine if they also have typical hc  hii  region sizes .    in summary ,",
    "we have identified a number of promising candidates for hc  hii  regions associated with class  ii methanol masers .",
    "further observations at higher angular resolution are needed to study the properties and fully characterize these regions .",
