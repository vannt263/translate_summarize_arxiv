    "the colorings we are concerned with are the so - called fox colorings , @xcite . given a knot diagram and an integer @xmath1 we consider the integers @xmath2 mod @xmath1",
    ", whose set will be denoted @xmath3 .",
    "we assign one integer ( call it a color ) to each arc of the diagram so that at each crossing the sum of the integers at the under - arcs minus twice the integer at the over - arc equals zero mod @xmath1 . in this way",
    ", we set up a system of equations over @xmath3 .",
    "each of the solutions of this system of equations is called an @xmath1-coloring of the knot under consideration .",
    "there are always at least @xmath1 solutions , regardless of the knot diagram or the integer @xmath1 we are choosing ; each of these @xmath1 solutions is obtained by assigning the same color to each arc of the diagram .",
    "these are called the trivial solutions . a one - to - one correspondence of the solutions of the systems of equations before and after the performance of each of the reidemeister moves is presented in @xcite . in this correspondence ,",
    "the trivial solutions go over to trivial solutions and non - trivial solutions go over to non - trivial solutions . in particular ,",
    "the number of solutions for each @xmath1 ( also referred to as the number of @xmath1-colorings ) , is an invariant of the knot under study .",
    "given an integer @xmath4 and a link @xmath5 , we let @xmath6 stand for the number of @xmath1-colorings of @xmath5 .    the efficiency of this invariant in distinguishing prime knots up to ten crossings is illustrated in @xcite .",
    "the invariant we there associate to each knot is in fact the _ color spectrum _ of the knot i.e. , the sequence of numbers of @xmath1-colorings .",
    "we remark that the notion of _ quandles _ generalizes the notion of @xmath1-colorings , see .",
    "the importance of knowing the color spectrum of the knot @xmath5 under consideration , is that it tells us immediately whether @xmath5 is interesting or not for our current research and whether there is significant topological information in the spectrum .",
    "in fact , for any @xmath1 , the number of trivial colorings is @xmath1 .",
    "hence if the number of colorings for a given @xmath1 is greater than @xmath1 , there exist then non - trivial colorings for the knot under consideration . as an example , the trefoil exhibits nine @xmath7-colorings .",
    "it has then non - trivial @xmath7-colorings .",
    "given an integer @xmath4 , assume there are non - trivial @xmath1-colorings on a given knot @xmath5 .",
    "assume further that @xmath8 is a diagram of @xmath5 .",
    "we let @xmath9 denote the minimum number of distinct colors assigned to the arcs of @xmath8 it takes to produce a non - trivial @xmath1-coloring on @xmath8 .",
    "we denote @xmath10 the minimum of these minima over all diagrams @xmath8 of @xmath5 : @xmath11 for each @xmath5 , we call @xmath10 the * minimum number of colors of k , mod @xmath1*. in the sequel , we will drop the `` mod @xmath1 '' whenever it is clear which @xmath1 we are referring to .",
    "note that @xmath10 is tautologically a topological invariant of @xmath5 .",
    "apparently , in order to calculate @xmath10 , we have to consider a diagram of @xmath5 , and find the minimum number of colors it takes to construct a non - trivial @xmath1-coloring .",
    "this operation should then be repeated for all diagrams of @xmath5 , presenting the minimum for each of these diagrams . finally , the minimum of these minima is the @xmath12 . in this article",
    "we present techniques that allow us to calculate @xmath12 in infinitely many cases and in other cases to estimate its upper bounds .",
    "we regard the torus knots of type @xmath0 as our case study .",
    "the features of modular arithmetic allow us to calculate @xmath13 exactly for some combinations of @xmath14 and @xmath1 .",
    "the introduction of certain transformations on diagrams ( teneva transformations ) allows us to better estimate the upper bounds on @xmath13 for other combinations of @xmath14 and @xmath1 .",
    "this invariant was first introduced in @xcite .",
    "considerations of the authors about it led them to set forth the kauffman - harary conjecture which has already been proven to be true for rational knots , @xcite , and for montesinos links , @xcite .",
    "[ kauffman - harary , @xcite][conj : kh ] let @xmath15 be a prime integer and assume @xmath5 is an alternating knot of determinant @xmath15 .",
    "then , any non - trivial @xmath15-coloring on any minimal diagram of @xmath5 assigns different colors to different arcs of the diagram .",
    "we note that the kauffman - harary conjecture deals only with a specific @xmath1 per knot",
    ". moreover , the knots under consideration in this conjecture are all alternating knots of prime determinant ( and the specific @xmath1 is precisely this determinant , for each of these knots ) . in this article",
    "we adopt a broader point of view by not specifying @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , we would like to develop computational tools that would allow us to calculate the @xmath12 for any @xmath1 , and for any @xmath5 . here",
