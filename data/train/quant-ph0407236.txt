    "it is of fundamental interest to investigate the properties of elementary systems in quantum physics .",
    "we have considered a system consisting of two neutral spin 1/2 particles that interact through the spin - spin potential .",
    "this distinctly quantum system displays many of the characteristic features of quantum systems , including entanglement , tunneling , bound states , decaying states , and spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "a similar system , consisting of harmonically trapped alkali ions that may be entangled through the dipole - dipole potential , has been proposed for use in quantum computing@xcite .",
    "hence there is practical as well as fundamental interest in the model we consider .",
    "we wanted to investigate a system of two entangled particles that interact through a potential that vanishes at infinity .",
    "one purpose of the model is to allow us to investigate the behavior of one portion of an entangled system when we adiabatically perturb the other portion , and thereby to investigate the coupling between the separate portions of the entangled system as a function of the distance between them .",
    "as mentioned , the properties exhibited may find application in quantum computing . in our model",
    ", we find a coupling between portions of an entangled state that in principle allows one to send signals by the modulation of the magnetic field provided the potential energy from the dipole potential does not vanish .",
    "the maximum separation possible is probably of the order of micrometers or less and depends on the maximum modulation frequency of the signal . in principle",
    ", protective measurements@xcite can be done in one region of the system to determine the elements of the reduced density matrix , something which would not be possible using conventional measurements unless an ensemble of identical systems was available@xcite .",
    "the use of protective measurements would permit the entanglement to remain .",
    "the adiabatic perturbation in the protective measurement can be as large as desired , so long as the state evolves continuously and the instantaneous energy eigenvalue does not cross that of other levels .    other interesting features of this spin - spin coupling model are apparent when we apply an adiabatic perturbation that is an inhomogeneous magnetic field over all space .",
    "we find the initial singlet evolves into an unbound state and the triplet develops a double hump potential , suggestive of spontaneous symmetry breaking . for the latter case ,",
    "it is possible for one particle to tunnel across the barrier to the other side .",
    "also , we are able to study a system in which a superposition evolves continuously in time , with the wavefunction changing from entangled to unentangled and back to entangled . when we eliminate a spatial cutoff and allow the dipole - dipole potential to become infinite , spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs in the degenerate ground state .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . a model for entangled states via spin - spin interaction",
    "is constructed in sec .",
    "we study this model for an inhomogeneous magnetic field over all space in sec .",
    "iii , and for a constant and inhomogeneous magnetic field over a half space containing only one of the particles in sec .",
    "we discuss the possibility of the protective measurement in our model in sec .",
    "v. we summarize our results in sec .",
    "two appendices include another possible model and detail calculations outlined in the text .",
    "we will assume that we have a pair ( designated 1 and 2 ) of identical , uncharged , spin 1/2 particles with coordinates @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( and corresponding momenta @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we will apply a magnetic field and determine the evolution of the system in the impulsive approximation , in which we assume the kinetic energy of the system does not change as we apply the magnetic field .",
    "we will consider two cases .",
    "case 1 : an inhomogeneous magnetic field is present throughout all space , and case 2 : the magnetic field is present only in the region to the right of the origin .    for both cases ,",
    "the hamiltonian without external fields for our system is @xmath4and the potential energy @xmath5 for two interacting magnetic dipoles @xmath6 and @xmath7 located at @xmath0 and @xmath8 respectively is @xmath9where @xmath10 is a unit vector in the direction @xmath11 .",
    "the first term is the usual dipole - dipole interaction while the second term is the hyperfine interaction term .    in our paper",
    ", we will first analyze the model with the approximation that the changes in the kinetic energy , potential energy , and the relative position of the particles are all negligible when we turn on a perturbing magnetic field ( impulsive approximation)@xcite . in this approximation ,",
    "the position of the particle does not change significantly during the interaction .",
    "this approximation is in the same spirit as the born - oppenheimer approximation in which the electronic motion about the nuclei of a diatomic molecule is much more rapid than the vibrational motion of the nuclei .",
    "thus it is possible to obtain the eigenfunction for the nuclear motion using the energy eigenvalue for the electronic motion as the potential .",
    "on the other hand we assume that during the application of the magnetic field the spins evolve adiabatically .",
    "this approximation is based on the observation that the spin precession for the states is much faster than the translational motion . with this impulsive approximation",
    ", there is no change in the potential energy or the relative position of the particles and in this sense the states act as if bound . to determine",
    "if the states are in fact bound , one would have to treat the separation as a dynamical variable , and include the potential and kinetic energy terms in solving schrodinger s equation .",
    "if the potential energy eigenvalues obtained with the impulsive approximation are positive , then it is very unlikely that the state is in fact bound",
    ". only states with negative potential energy eigenvalues could be bound .    under these assumptions",
    "we can choose the coordinates system so that the particles are separated along the @xmath12-direction , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 have opposite signs .",
    "therefore we can rotate the coordinate system such that @xmath15 where @xmath10 is a unit vector in the @xmath12-direction . with",
    "this coordinate transformations the term @xmath16(@xmath17 ) becomes @xmath18 .",
    "using @xmath19 and neglecting the hyperfine interaction term which is relevant only at short distances ( see the discussion in appendix a ) , we can approximate @xmath5 as @xmath20the classical dipole force will always be in the @xmath12-direction , and therefore the separation will always be along the @xmath12-axis , and we have essentially a one dimensional problem . for two classical dipoles oriented along the @xmath12-axis , the interaction would result in an attractive ( repulsive ) force if the dipoles were parallel ( antiparallel ) .",
    "we will study the effects of applying an adiabatically perturbing magnetic field also in the @xmath12-direction . with this special choice of field ,",
    "the problem remains a one dimensional problem since the magnetic force on each particle is also in the @xmath12-direction .",
    "the spin components of the eigenstates of @xmath21 will be simultaneous eigenstates of the total spin @xmath22 and the total spin in the @xmath12-direction , @xmath23 .",
    "these states comprise the usual singlet state with @xmath24 , @xmath25 corresponding to @xmath26 , and the triplet spin eigenstates with @xmath27 corresponding to @xmath28 .",
    "thus the dipole - dipole potential results in entangled states@xcite .",
    "because of the indistinguishability of the particles , it is not possible to describe which particle is on the left or right , instead quantum mechanics indicates there is a superposition of both .",
    "the spatial part of the wavefunctions is chosen so the total wavefunction is antisymmetric with respect to the interchange of particles 1 and 2 . introducing the symmetrized ( antisymmetrized ) wave function by @xmath29where @xmath30 ( @xmath17 ) represents the wavefunction for particle @xmath31 on the right side of the origin ( @xmath32 ) , and @xmath33 on the left side ( @xmath34 ) ,",

    "the states @xmath48 could be considered as analogous to classical systems in which the two magnetic moments are parallel to each other , leading to attractive forces between the particles , whereas the @xmath49 states could be considered analogous to classical systems in which the magnetic moments are antiparallel resulting in repulsive forces .",
    "it is interesting that the singlet state has zero energy for the spin - spin interaction and therefore is not expected to be a bound state .",

    "therefore , under the assumption that the two particles are on the opposite sides of the origin ( @xmath131 ) , we require the following equalities to avoid crossing of energy levels : @xmath132which are obeyed provided the energy contribution from the constant magnetic field @xmath63 is significantly greater than the contributions from either the inhomogeneous field or the dipole potential ( @xmath133 ) @xcite .",
    "independently we also need a condition in order for the adiabatic evolution to proceed ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "namely we need to turn on the magnetic field ( inhomogeneous part ) slowly , and the condition for the time period t for this switching is @xmath134or , @xmath135therefore the greater the separation , the more slowly the inhomogeneous field needs to be applied .",

    "it suggests a possibility of the tunneling effect , namely , the exchanging of the two particles through the barrier .",
    "we summarize these calculations in appendix b.    two remarks are in order : when the potential barrier becomes infinite the ground state will be degenerate ( @xmath165 ) .",
    "this means there are no oscillations at all . and hence there exist the states @xmath152 and @xmath153 separately . although these states are not eigenstates of the parity operator , because of the degeneracy they are allowed states .",
    "this is an example of the spontaneous symmetry breaking . to examine the possibility of the exchanging effect more precisely we also need to include the hyperfine interaction term in the original potential ( [ u ] ) , which becomes important at short distances .",
    "we assume the magnetic field @xmath166 is in the @xmath12-direction and that it is non - zero only in some region on the right side of the origin ( @xmath60 ) . outside of this region , for example on the left ,",

    "alternatively we consider the use of a protective stern - gerlach measurement , in which there is an adiabatic interaction between the pointer and the systemav , aavwave , aavprotec .",
    "we want to examine the possibility of the protective measurement in our model under the assumption we will work in a decoherence free subspace . in previous discussions of protective measurements , only the case of a small perturbation was considered in order to minimize the change in the wavefunction of the state to be measured . in our system , such restrictions are not necessary . as long as the interaction is adiabatic",
    ", the state will evolve continuously as an eigenstate of the instantaneous hamiltonian , without any transition provided there is no degeneracy in the energy .",
    "if the magnetic field is applied adiabatically , the field can become large , resulting in a large change in the wavefunction . because the changes are adiabatic , they are reversible as the magnetic field",
    "is reduced . since a protective measurement of the spin for",
    "our two particle system does not change the state of the system , the protective measurement does not end the entanglement .",
    "in the spin - spin model , the states @xmath104 and @xmath249 into which @xmath26 and @xmath235 evolve when a magnetic field is applied on the right side are non - degenerate so a protective measurement of the reduced density matrix should be possible .",
    "indeed all four basis states@xmath224 , @xmath126 , @xmath250 , and @xmath188 are non - degenerate provided @xmath251 and @xmath252 so a protective measurement should be possible of the density matrix@xcite . as a consequence the result of a protective measurement of an observable @xmath230 that acts only on the left side can be written as the trace over the reduced density matrix:@xmath253    note that here @xmath254 represents the result of a single protective measurement on a single system .",

    "note that nowhere do we use the specific form of the potential .",
    "indeed , we could use the formalism presented with any function of the separation .    to illustrate the application of a protective measurement",
    ", we could measure the total spin in the z- direction for both particles using local measurements on the left side only .",
    "we assume we use a stern - gerlach analyzer with an inhomogeneous field in the @xmath12-direction and we observe the deflection of the wave packet corresponding to a particle .",
    "we assume we have calibrated our apparatus so that we can determine the spin of a particle on the left side by observation of the deflection in the @xmath12- direction at a certain point in the experiment .",
    "since the particles are indistinguishable , a single protective measurement of the spin of a particle on the left will yield a deflection corresponding to the result @xmath256)=-\\frac{1}{2}\\sin \\theta\\]]where the value of @xmath227 is determined by the magnetic field on the right side and the distance between the particles .",
    "the corresponding total spin in the @xmath12-direction measured * on the right side * is @xmath257sin@xmath227 .",
    "since this protective measurement has not collapsed the wave function , we could do additional measurements * on the same state * to determine the rest of the density matrix @xmath258 in the @xmath49 subspace .",
    "if we used stern - gerlach analyzers with fields in the @xmath259 and @xmath260 directions for two additional experiments , respectively , we would find : @xmath261these components of the spin vanish because we chose the magnetic field on the right side to be in the @xmath12-direction .",
    "it is interesting to contrast the protective measurement of @xmath262 with the ordinary measurements . in an standard quantum mechanical measurement",
    "the wavefunction collapses and an eigenvalue of the operator is measured . to determine the expectation value of the operator",
    ", one needs to make a statistically significant number of measurements on an ensemble of identically prepared systems . in our model , since the particles are indistinguishable , for each standard measurement on a different identically prepared system , a deflection in the stern - gerlach apparatus will be measured that corresponds to spin of @xmath263 or @xmath264 .",
    "if enough measurements are done , it will be determined that the probability of measuring @xmath263 is @xmath265 and the probability of measuring @xmath266 is @xmath267 . using these probabilities",
    ", the standard measurements will determine that the expectation value of the operator @xmath268 on the left side is @xmath269 in agreement with the _ single _ protective measurement .",
    "this comparison of the two methods illustrates some of the advantages of protective measurements and some of the disadvantages of standard measurements .",
    "a system was considered in which two neutral spin 1/2 particles interact through a diple - dipole potential .",
    "the potential leads to singlet and triplet entangled states which are modified when we apply a magnetic field over all space ( case 1 ) , or over just the region to the right of the origin ( case 2 ) .",
    "for the case 1 we showed that the singlet state is essentially unstable and it tends to separate .",
    "however , the spin zero component of the triplet will have a double hump shape energy which implies the particles will tend to stay near the minima with high probabilities and form a bound state .",
    "also we showed that it is possible to have a tunneling effect in this case .",
    "such an effect might have applications in quantum computation .",
    "for the case 2 we observed that although the external field is applied only in one part of the system , the other part will be affected by it due to the entanglement of the system .",
    "this manifests the nonlocality of the entanglement in quantum mechanics .",
    "it appears protective measurements can be used to determine the density matrix without ending the entanglement .",
    "as discussed above for the case of finite separation , one limitation in the signaling between the two regions of space in this model lies in the requirement that we must have an adiabatic perturbation or transitions will occur between states .",
    "when the magnetic field is turned on , it must be done slowly enough so that no transitions are induced between the initial state and other states .",
    "although the specific restrictions depend on the manner in which the perturbations are applied , they require that the potential due to the dipole - dipole interaction does not vanish .",
    "we are deeply saddened to report that jeeva anandan died during the preparation of this paper .",
    "this work was partially supported by the nfs , grant no .",
    "gjm would like to thank the nasa institute for advanced concepts for supporting this work .",
    "in this appendix we will examine our model with additional confining potentials ( for instance , created by the optical laser ) .",
    "for simplicity we approximate this potential by a harmonic potential around certain point @xmath270 with characteristic frequency @xmath271 , namely , @xmath272 .",
    "we choose the center of the potential in such a way that two particles will be separated by a distance @xmath273 . under these conditions",
    "the ground state energy of the particles is @xmath274 ( we use @xmath275 in appendices . ) and the corresponding states are @xmath276 for @xmath17 and the parameter @xmath277 is introduced . to have a stable ground state in our model we require the energy levels",
    "are well separated , or the parameter @xmath278 is large .",
    "( similarly we can assign these wave packets for the free particles case too . )",
    "after we obtain the spatial wave functions for the singlet and the triplets @xcite , we can estimate the effect of the hyperfine interaction term in the dipole - dipole potential ( [ u ] ) .",
    "we evaluate the expectation values of the delta function as follows .",
    "@xmath279 therefore , under our assumptions the contribution from the hyperfine interaction is negligible in our model because of the exponential factor in ( [ dex ] ) .",
    "however , in contrast , this term plays an important role in a situation where the distance becomes very small and we need to add this contribution too .",
    "this regime is discussed in the literature , for instance , see ref . @xcite and references therein .",
    "next we estimate the change in the positions of the particles and the kinetic energy of them . from simple calculations",
    "it is easy to see that the expectation values of the relative position and the center of mass are zero .",
    "similarly we obtain for the expectation value for the center of mass kinetic energy @xmath280 and for the relative kinetic energy we have @xmath281 again , the second term inside the parenthesis is negligible by our assumptions .",
    "and hence we see that the corrections due to the motion of the particles are small .",
    "to estimate the tunneling probability we simplify our model as follows .",
    "first we calculate the minima @xmath282 of the potential ( [ vb ] ) , this is easily found @xmath283 then we evaluate the the tunneling probability between two minima through the dipole - dipole interaction barrier assuming that the potential is mainly dominated by this interaction in small distance .",
    "we use the wkb method landau to get the probability @xmath284 for the particle with the kinetic energy @xmath285 ( the mass is @xmath72 ) , that is , @xmath286 .\\ ] ] in our case the simplified potential is @xmath287 . as we mentioned",
    "earlier we introduce the cutoff at @xmath288 to get rid of the divergent integral . under these assumptions and defining the momentum @xmath289 and @xmath290 corresponding to the minima and the cutoff respectively , i.e. @xmath291 and @xmath292 , the integral inside the exponent of ( [ w1 ] ) is evaluated as below .",
    "@xmath293 where @xmath294 is the incomplete beta function defined by @xmath295 and we neglect the positive orders of @xmath288 ( in @xmath296 limit ) .",
    "therefore for the rest particle ( @xmath297 ) at the minima , a rough estimate for the tunneling probability is @xmath298\\ ] ] which is given in the text after substituting @xmath289 and @xmath290 .",
    "another case is for the particle having the minimum potential energy ( @xmath299 ) : @xmath300\\ ] ] where @xmath301 is the usual beta function .",
    "and hence we see that this is the same order as ( [ e0 ] ) .                  strictly speaking the magnetic field",
    "must satisfy the maxwell equations , i.e. , @xmath302 and @xmath303 ( without external currents ) . in our case the simplest realistic inhomogeneous field might be chosen as @xmath304 which satisfies the maxwell equations .",
    "this choice of the field and the assumption @xmath305 yields the same result as obtained by our choice @xmath306 ( [ b1 ] ) .",
    "see also the discussions in ref .",
    "@xcite    this application of the field eliminates the non - level crossing condition ( [ equality1 ] ) . on the other hand , if we apply both parts of the magnetic field adiabatically , we will have more restrictive condition which limits the capabilities of our model .",
    "we can imagine two identical particles moving toward each other which are represented by gaussian wave packets which are superpositions of the different momenta of the plane waves .",
    "the time development of this system is similar to the one discussed in the text after eq .",
    "( [ psir ] ) .",
    "the spatial wave functions for the singlet and the triplets would not be normalized by the factor @xmath312 if we use these wave packets ( [ r],[l ] ) .",
    "this is because there is overlapping of two wave packets . and we need to renormalize the spatial wave functions after forming ( [ sa ] ) .",
    "therefore these wave packets are approximated trial wave functions ."
