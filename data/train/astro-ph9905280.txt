    "nearby dwarf galaxies are classified in four basic types : _ ( i ) _ dwarf irregular ( di ) galaxies are the most common type by number , and are usually unstructured gas rich systems with varying levels of star formation occurring in a haphazard manner across the galaxy .",
    "the velocity field of the hi gas in these systems is dominated by random motions rather than rotation ( binney & de vaucouleurs 1981 ; staveley - smith , davies & kinman 1992 ; lo , sargent & young 1993 ) , with peak column densities ( as high as 4 @xmath8 or 12  @xmath9  pc@xmath10 ) similar to those of larger galaxies ; _ ( ii ) _ blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxies are gas rich systems dominated by very active star formation , and resembling massive hii regions seen in large galaxies .",
    "they are thought to be forming stars at a rate which they can only maintain for a short period ( papaderos 1994 ) ; _ ( iii ) _ dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies usually have no gas in their center down to very low limits ( knapp 1978 ) , although it has been suggested that the gas supply may reside outside the central regions , driven there by supernova explosions and stellar outflows ( puche 1992 , carignan 1998 ; bowen 1997 ) .",
    "the stellar distribution of dsph is similar to that of globular clusters , although less centrally concentrated , but a detailed study of the stellar population often reveals that several distinct bursts of star formation have occurred in the past ( e.g. smecker - hane 1994 ) . finally , _",
    "( iv ) _ dwarf elliptical ( de ) galaxies look similar to their namesake elliptical galaxies .",
    "it was previously thought that they contain only old stars , but new data suggest a sequence of several bursts of star formation , some of which may be quite recent , are needed to explain the characteristics of their stellar population ( ferguson & binngeli 1994 , babul & ferguson 1996 , han 1997 ) .",
    "thus , broadly speaking , there are two classes of dwarf galaxies .",
    "late - type ( di and bcd ) are star forming systems ; the main difference between di and bcd galaxies seems to be found in their star formation rate - and there is strong evidence that these are otherwise very similar systems ( e.g tolstoy 1998a ; taylor 1997 ) .",
    "the other class consists of early - type systems ( dsph and de ) which are typically not _ currently _ forming stars .",
    "the difference between dsphs and des is not well defined , and lies only in the total mass of the system ( des are typically more massive than dsphs ) .",
    "connecting the above classes of dwarfs in a unified evolutionary scenario has been the subject of considerable study .",
    "in fact , in spite of the qualitative differences among the various types , a structural kinship of early and late type dwarfs becomes evident at a more quantitative level .",
    "binggeli ( 1994 ) compared the two classes in terms of their central surface brightness and disk scale length vs. absolute blue magnitude for a virgo cluster sample .",
    "he found that early and late types show essentially the same distribution in such a parameter space . even before these results",
    ", the concept of a transition of some kind from late to early types has been the rationale for a number of studies suggesting different evolutionary schemes .",
    "einasto ( 1974 ) , and later on lin & faber ( 1983 ) , pointed out that since early type dwarfs are often found as satellites of large galaxies , ram pressure stripping in such a high density environment could provide an efficient mechanism to remove all the gas from a galaxy , although binggeli ( 1994 ) gives a list of arguments against it .",
    "the importance of the environment for the evolution of galaxies has already been emphasized by lacey & silk  ( 1991 ) .",
    "the major difficulty is to explain the much lower surface brightness of dis with respect to des .",
    "one scenario for the di @xmath7 de transition was proposed by davies & phillips ( 1988 ) , who postulated that the gas , instead of being swept away by some transport mechanism , could have been consumed by astration .",
    "as it will become clear from our results , astration ( as well as outflows ) do not appear to be able to rid a galaxy of its ism .",
    "an alternate hypothesis is that dis and des might have had common progenitors , but have evolved differently .",
    "what are the reasons for such a behavior ?",
    "at least two possibilities need to be considered : _",
    "( i ) _ a difference in the dark matter ( dm ) content ; _ ( ii ) _ the effects of the environment . as we will show in this paper",
    "the dm fraction must strongly affects the evolution of a low mass galaxy and its star formation history .",
    "given that the major differences between the two classes reside in their star formation histories , it is important to determine the effects of star formation on the ism . among these effects ,",
    "the most important one is very likely the energy injection from massive stars .",
    "since dwarfs have shallow potential wells , the energy deposition can have consequences that are dramatic in comparison to normal galaxies .",
    "several recent studies of the kinematics of the hi gas in nearby galaxies ( e.g. puche & westphal 1993 , young & lo 1996 , hunter et al .",
    "1998 , wilcots & miller 1998 , van zee , skillman & salzer 1998 ) show clear evidence of a disturbed ism , where low density regions , often surrounded by denser shells , expanding at velocities of the order of @xmath11  km  s@xmath12 are identified .",
    "the most natural interpretation of these data implies that these are regions of mechanical energy injection due to stellar ( winds and/or sne ) activity .",
    "the hi data can even be interpreted as a hint that the least massive galaxies can lose their gas , in a process that we will refer to in this paper as blowaway .",
    "indirect evidence that such a phenomenon might indeed occur is given by suntzeff ( 1993 ) . by studying the metallicity distribution of stars in the sextans dwarf galaxy , these authors find that a possible explanation of the observed sharp cut - off at high metallicity is an an almost closed - box evolution followed by a quick removal of gas , or , in our terminology , a blowaway .",
    "if the gas is blown away from the galaxy , one might still expect to find it in the surroundings of dsphs .",
    "there is currently no unambiguous evidence for this ( e.g. bowen 1997 ) , although there are tantalising suggestions , ( e.g. carignan .",
    "1998 ) , but the limits on diffuse , extended and/or hot gas are not very stringent .",
    "asca observations ( della ceca 1996 ; see also heckman 1995 ) of the star - forming dwarf galaxy ngc1569 have been able to assess the presence of diffuse hot gas ( @xmath13  kev ) very likely heated by supernova explosions .",
    "similarly , bomans , chu & hopp ( 1997 ) found x - ray emission from hot gas within a supergiant shell in the dwarf irregular ngc  4449 , which also has a large - scale radio synchrotron halo ( klein 1996 ) .",
    "if the gas remains bound to the galaxy rather than being expelled into the intergalactic medium , after a cooling time it can rain back again onto the galaxy and become available to refuel subsequent star formation , in a process reminiscent of the `` galactic fountain '' thought to be at work in larger spirals such as the milky way .",
    "this circulation could in principle provide an attractive explanation for the intermittent star formation activity in dsphs , such as carina ( smecker - hane 1994 ) which shows at least four distinct main sequence turn - offs separated by a few gyr .",
    "the difficulty with this scenario is that the required residence time of the gas in the halo seems to be larger than its typical cooling time , unless its density is very low , which is not completely implausible .",
    "there are also liable to significant , difficult to quantify , effects from nearby large galaxies .",
    "if energy injection is mainly regulated by massive stars , then the observed metallicity range of dwarfs must be consistent with what is inferred from massive star energetics and dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "several studies ( matteucci & tosi 1985 , clayton & pantelaki 1993 , marconi 1994 ; lisenfeld & ferrara 1998 ) have already addressed this issue , and a consensus has been reached that all dwarf galaxies must have lost varying amounts of gas and metals in the past , and probably that they continue to do so today .",
    "metal enhanced outflows can explain the lack of prominent nuclei and the lower - than - average metallicity of low mass systems ( larson 1974 ) , and seem to explain the luminosity - metallicity relationship for dis ( lequeux 1979 ) . the selective loss of metals , particularly oxygen , would also resolve the discrepancy between the yields calculated from stellar evolution theory and those measured by observations ( pagel 1992 ; maeder 1992 ) .",
    "dekel & silk ( 1986 ) concluded that in order to reproduce the surface brightness and metallicity decline towards low masses , a significant gas loss in a dominant dm halo potential has to take place , with an upper critical halo circular velocity of @xmath14  km  s@xmath12 .",
    "vader ( 1986 , 1987 ) put the idea of `` metal enhanced '' winds on a more quantitative basis .",
    "recent numerical experiments ( maclow & ferrara 1999 , hereafter mf ) have shown that indeed during multi - supernova events in dwarf galaxies , most of the metals mixed with the hot cavity gas are able to leave the galaxy , whereas the fraction of cool ism gas lost is relatively small ( at most @xmath157% of the galaxy mass ) .",
    "nevertheless , if mixing of the two components in the wind , or with the hot , shell - evaporated interior takes place , this amount of gas is sufficient to dilute the wind metallicity to a level comparable or only slightly higher than the one of the ism of the parent galaxy .",
    "we will discuss this point in more detail in the section 2.1.1 .",
    "dark matter is the second important ingredient necessary to properly understand dwarf galaxy evolution .",
    "data on the dm content of low mass galaxies , although slowly accumulating are still scarce , and often difficult to interpret .",
    "the @xmath16 ratios have been shown to vary between 5.7 and 94 ( e.g. mateo 1993 , pryor 1996 ) , confirming the perception that small objects tend to be dark matter dominated .",
    "the same conclusion can be reached from rotation curve studies : although exploring the mass distribution only down to relatively large values , a clear trend of increasing dark - to - visible mass ratios with decreasing mass is seen ( mateo 1993 ) .    in this study",
    "we consider the effects of stellar feedback and dm on the evolution of dwarfs from a new perspective .",
    "there have been a few attempts to combine chemical and dynamical evolution models for dwarf galaxies of various types ( koeppen 1995 ; de young & heckman 1994 ; de young & gallagher 1990 ; burkert , theis & hensler 1993 ; silk 1997 ) .",
    "our approach follows naturally from the evidence that supernovae ( sne ) and superbubbles ( sbs ) are the main contributors to the ism energy budget .",
    "metals are injected into the ism during every sn explosion event , and if an outflow develops , it allows gas to escape from the disk and even from the gravitational potential of the dm halo .",
    "the amount of gas and metals lost is regulated by the pressure in the ism , which in turn depends upon the energy injection by previous sne .",
    "the pressure is increased as the result of the fact that gas random motions induced by sn explosions generate a non - thermal ( turbulent ) pressure in addition to the thermal one .",
    "ultimately the pressure can be increased up to the point at which bubbles produced by sne are confined in the main body of the galaxy , thus inhibiting the outflow .",
    "depressurisation occurs as the parcels of gas ( clouds ) move and collide at supersonic velocities with respect to their internal sound speed ; radiative dissipation behind shocks following collisions then stabilizes the system . on this basis",
    ", we expect a correlation between overall dynamical properties , such as gas velocity dispersion , and metallicity of the galaxy .",
    "very few detailed observations of the velocity dispersion of hi gas in dis have been made ; the situation is made worse by the lack of abundance measurements for those galaxies for which velocity information is available . only for a handful of galaxies velocity dispersion and metallicity",
    "are simulatneously available and so no correlation has yet been firmly established .",
    "however , some studies ( lequeux 1979 ; hunter 1982 ; matteucci & chiosi 1983 ; skillman , kennicutt & hodge 1989 ) suggest a general trend of increasing metallicity with dynamical mass .    the main aim of this paper is to include the above physical processes , governed by stellar feedback and dm , in a consistent evolutionary model of dwarf galaxies able to explain their most fundamental properties .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",

    ", it is necessary to describe our galaxy model .    for our purposes , we model a dwarf galaxy as a system initially made of a visible disk with combined gaseous and stellar mass @xmath17 , and a dm halo of mass @xmath27 .",
    "we assume that the gas has a density distribution given by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the galactocentric radius , @xmath31 is the vertical coordinate , and @xmath32 is a function to be determined , for example , by imposing hydrostatic equilibrium of the gas in the total gravitational potential of the dwarf galaxy , @xmath33 as due to the halo and disk components .    the behavior of the dark - to - visible mass ratio @xmath34 in galaxies has been explored in great detail in a key study by persic ( 1996 , pss ) .",
    "these authors find that @xmath35 is a function of the galactic mass ; using their relations one can derive the dependence of this ratio on the visible mass of the galaxy : @xmath36 where @xmath37 . from this equation",
    "it is clear that the gravitational potential of dwarf galaxies with @xmath38 is dominated by the dm halo ; therefore we can neglect the potential due to visible mass @xmath39 . in the rest of the paper we will not make any specific assumption on @xmath35 , apart from specific examples where we will use eq . [ pss ] .",
    "the density profiles of dwarf dm halos remain uncertain .",
    "a comparison between cdm cosmological model predictions and the available observational data , discussed by mf , shows that a considerable disagreement still exist . in view of these uncertainties",
    ", we calculate the halo gravitational potential by assuming that the density distribution of the halo can be approximated by a modified isothermal sphere ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) , which is general enough to be appropriate for an idealized situation such as the one presented here , and does reproduce the observed central core .",
    "it follows that @xmath40 the halo mass as a function of radius is then @xmath41 where @xmath42 is an appropriately defined halo radius . following a common _ ansatz _ we take @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the characteristic radius within which the mean dm density is 200 times the present critical density ,",

    "we have in addition assumed that the ratio between the hi and the optical radius is @xmath63 2 .",
    "this is roughly consistent with the results of salpeter & hoffman ( 1996 ) who found a value @xmath64 .",

    "these are : @xmath66 in order to provide convenient expressions for the gas scale height @xmath67 , number density @xmath68 , and column density @xmath69 , we assume that most of the mass is concentrated in a thin disk , producing a constant gravitational acceleration @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the total matter surface density .",
    "such a choice generates an exponential gas distribution with parameters given by the following formulae : @xmath72 where @xmath73 , @xmath74 is an effective sound speed , @xmath75 is the gas sound speed ; @xmath76 is defined by equation  ( [ rc ] ) in kpc , and @xmath77 is the mean molecular weight .",

    "we note that in this approximation , @xmath79 is independent of both @xmath35 and @xmath80 and , given that @xmath81 , only weakly dependent on the visible mass of the galaxy .",
    "[ mg ] describes the evolution of the galactic gas mass @xmath17 .",
    "the gas content is decreased by star formation and outflow phenomena , at rates @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively ; it is increased by infall and stellar ejecta , at rates @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively .",
    "the star formation rate @xmath86 has been suggested by different authors to depend on various quantities as the gas mass , column density or number density .",
    "we choose @xmath86 , following dekel & silk ( 1987 ) , to be proportional to the gas mass divided by the galactic free - fall time @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the gravitational constant : @xmath89 ; @xmath90 is the value appropriate to reproduce the actual star formation rate in the milky way .",
    "in addition to its simplicity , this formula represents the most natural scaling for the process and it can be physically motivated .",
    "we will see below as this expression results is a schmidt - type law , modified by the presence of dm .",
    "the gas mass returned from stars , @xmath85 , depends on parameters as the stellar imf , yield and return fraction , which are defined and discussed in sec .",
    "the infall rate , @xmath84 , is very uncertain ; for this reason most of our calculations assume no infall ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "we therefore presume that infall should not represent a major effect for low mass galaxies .    the term describing the gas outflow rate @xmath92 is complex , and it is discussed in the following section , where we also introduce the distinction between blowout and blowaway processes .      _",
    "( a ) blowout _      the evolution of a point explosion in an exponentially stratified medium , as the one introduced above , has been derived by kompaneets ( 1960 ) .",
    "this solution accurately approximates the exact numerical solution , ( see for example maclow 1989 ) and can be obtained from dimensional analysis .",
    "it is useful to rederive it briefly in this context .",
    "suppose that the gas density distribution is horizontally homogeneous and @xmath102 .",
    "the velocity of the shock wave is @xmath103 , where the pressure @xmath104 is roughly equal to @xmath105 ; @xmath106 is the total energy of the explosion , produced by @xmath107 sne in the association ( we usually take @xmath108 ) , each of energy @xmath109  ergs .",
    "then , it follows that @xmath110 this curve has a minimum at @xmath111 and this defines the height at which the shock wave , initially decelerating , is accelerated to infinity and a _ blowout _ takes place .",
    "therefore we will use @xmath112 as the fiducial height where the velocity @xmath113 is evaluated . introducing the mechanical luminosity of the explosion , @xmath114 , where @xmath115  yr is the average lifetime of massive stars , we write eq .",
    "[ v ] as @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the time at which @xmath111 .",
    "unfortunately , the kompaneets solution does not allow to estimate @xmath117 in a simple manner .",
    "for our purposes it is accurate enough to determine @xmath117 from solution for @xmath118 given by abbot ( 1981 ) valid for a homogeneous atmosphere , @xmath119 from which follows @xmath120 the final expression for @xmath93 , obtained by substituting @xmath117 in eq.[vb ] , is then @xmath121 where @xmath122  ergs  s@xmath12 and we have used eqs .",
    "[ nhn]-[n0 ] .",
    "[ vb1 ] shows that the velocity at the re - acceleration point @xmath111 is inversely proportional to the scale height of the gas to the 2/3 power . as a consequence",
    ", thick gas layers will be able to prevent blowout . note that @xmath67 depends on @xmath23 ( see eq .",
    "[ nhn ] ) , in turn regulated by the sn energy input , as described by eq .",
    "[ sig ] .",
    "there are three different possible fates for the sn - shocked gas , depending on the value of @xmath93 .",
    "if @xmath123 , where @xmath75 is the sound speed in the ism , the explosion will be confined in the disk and no mass loss will occur ; for @xmath124 the supershell will breakout of the disk into the halo , but the flow will remain bound to the galaxy ; finally , @xmath125 will lead to a true mass loss from the galaxy . in the second case ,",
    "it is likely that the hot gas will fall down again onto the disk , in a time scale comparable to the radiative cooling time @xmath126 where @xmath127 and @xmath128 are the gas temperature and density , respectively .",
    "since @xmath129 is much shorter than the typical chemical timescale ( @xmath130  yr ) , the delay on which the infall takes place with respect to the outflow is negligible , and to all purposes we can assume that the halo gas has always remained in the disk .",
    "once the blowout velocity @xmath93 has been determined , the mass outflow rate can then be written as @xmath131 note the inverse dependence on @xmath132 of @xmath92 : this simply reflects the fact that for a given driving energy @xmath133 , slower outflows are more mass loaded . in the previous expression the kinetic energy injected by the source @xmath134 ( sne or sbs ) is @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is an appropriate efficiency coefficient , that can be estimated from the assumed expansion law .",
    "for example , the expansion law given above has @xmath137 .",
    "however , for radiative bubbles , @xmath138 is smaller and equal to about 3% ( koo & mckee 1992 ) ; we use this value throughout the paper .",
    "since part of the kinetic energy is used to accelerate material in the equatorial plane of the bubble , only a mass fraction @xmath139 will leave the galaxy in the blowout .",
    "the actual value of @xmath140 is relatively uncertain and model dependent . in a recent study",
    "mf have calculated , by means of a series of numerical simulations that assume a galactic structure identical to the one adopted here , the value of @xmath140 in the range of mechanical luminosities @xmath141  ergs  s@xmath12 and galactic masses @xmath142 .",
    "they find that in general the gas ejection efficiency in case of blowout is relatively small ( @xmath143% ) .",
    "this conclusion has been obtained by keeping @xmath144 fixed throughout the entire energy injection phase , and , more crucially , assuming a power - law dependence of @xmath35 on the mass of the galaxy given by pss ( eq . [ pss ] ) .",
    "since here we try not to make any assumption on such relation , we choose to adopt the value @xmath145 , which should provide a reasonable estimate of the mass ejection fraction .    finally , @xmath146 is the explosion rate for the source @xmath18 .",
    "for sbs it is @xmath147 , where @xmath148 is the sn rate in the galaxy and @xmath149 is the fraction of sne occurring in an association ( @xmath150 ) .",
    "the analogous quantity for isolated sne is @xmath151 .",
    "the sn rate is obtained from @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is the number of sne per unit mass of stars formed which can be calculated once a given imf has been specified ( see sec . 2.2 ) .",
    "_ ( b ) blowaway _    by definition ,",
    "the blowout phenomenon discussed above involves a limited fraction of the parent galaxy mass , the one contained in cavites created by the sn / sb explosion .",
    "a much more disruptive event may occur , the blowaway , in which the gas content of the galaxy is completely expelled and lost to the intergalactic medium . in the following we derive in detail the necessary condition for the blowaway to occur .",
    "we have seen ( eq .",
    "[ v]-[vb ] ) that blowout takes place when the at @xmath111 the shell velocity exceeds the escape velocity . following the blowout the pressure inside the cavity drops suddenly due to the inward propagation of a rarefaction wave .",
    "the lateral walls of the shell , moving along the galaxy major axis will continue to expand unperturbed until they are overcome by the rarefaction wave at @xmath154 , corresponding to a time @xmath155 elapsed from the blowout . after that moment",
    ", the shell enters the momentum - conserving phase , since the driving pressure has been dissipated by the blowout .",
    "the correct determination of @xmath155 requires the solution of a 5-th order algebraic equation ( de young & heckman 1994 ) . in an exponential atmosphere",
    "the shock wave moves faster in the vertical direction than in the equatorial one ; hence the ratio of the vertical to equatorial velocity is @xmath156 and , when blowout takes place , @xmath157 . at the same moment",

    "the requirement for the blowaway to take place is that the momentum of the shell ( of mass @xmath162 at @xmath163 ) is larger than the momentum necessary to accelerate the gas outside @xmath163 ( of mass @xmath164)at a velocity larger than the escape velocity : @xmath165 where @xmath166 $ ] , @xmath167 , @xmath168 $ ] .",

    "unless the galaxy is perfectly spherical , blowaway is always preceded by blowout ; between the two events the aspect of the galaxy may look extremely perturbed , with one or more huge cavities left after blowout .",
    "let us now consider the various terms appearing in eq .",
    "as stated above the gas mass returned from stars , @xmath85 , is dependent on the imf , @xmath178 , the return fraction , @xmath179 ( the fraction of the total mass transformed into stars which is subsequently ejected back into the ism ) , and the net stellar yield , @xmath180 ( the total mass of an element ejected by all stars back into the ism per unit mass of matter locked into stars ) .",
    "the imf is of critical importance , since it determines the relative number of high mass ( which eventually will end their life as type ii sne ) and low mass stars .",
    "however , its true nature is not well understood .",
    "usually a single power - law function is used ( there is little compelling evidence for a multi - component fit [ mateo 1988 ] ; see also padoan 1997 ) with small differences among the most frequently used indexes .",

    "we choose oxygen for the following reasons : _",
    "( i ) _ it is produced mainly in type ii sne , which are also governing the mass loss and dynamics of the galactic ism via their energy input ; _ ( ii ) _ a large sample of dwarf galaxies with good quality abundance data for this species is available ( see sect .",
    "4 ) ; _ ( iii ) _ oxygen yields have also been extensively studied by several authors ( arnett 1978 , woosley & weaver 1986 , thielemann , nomoto & hashimoto 1992 , maeder 1992 ) and there is a good consensus about their dependence on the stellar mass .",
    "we therefore take @xmath187 , the oxygen mass fraction .",
    "the returned fraction and the net yield can be obtained using the standard formulae ( maeder 1992 ) : @xmath188 where the imf @xmath178 is defined between the lower and upper masses @xmath189 and @xmath190 , and @xmath191 ( @xmath192 for @xmath193 and @xmath194 for @xmath195 ) is the remnant mass ( white dwarf or neutron star ) .",
    "the value of the power law index is @xmath196 ( standard salpeter ) and @xmath197 ( scalo 1986 ) .",
    "we have taken the oxygen stellar yield , @xmath198 ( the mass fraction of a star of mass @xmath199 converted into oxygen and ejected ) from arnett ( 1990 ) . with these assumptions",
    "we obtain @xmath200 and @xmath201 for the ( salpeter , scalo ) imf , respectively .",
    "we will present results only for the salpeter imf ( although we have studied a few cases with the scalo imf ) as differences are relatively minor and salpeter s law seems to be currently better supported by a variety of observational evidences .    the previous values for the yields seem to be robust , although recent studies have pointed out that they might somewhat vary with metallicity .",
    "for example , using new stellar evolution models for @xmath202 ( 1/20@xmath203 solar ) and @xmath204 ( solar ) , which include new opacities , maeder ( 1992 ) calculated stellar yields for , among other species , oxygen as a function of metallicity and the expected mass limit for the creation of black holes .",
    "the stellar models take into account metal dependent opacity and nuclear effects , changes of mass loss rate with metallicity and moderate core - overshooting .",
    "yields of heavy elements tend to decrease with stellar mass if a black hole is formed , because in this case heavy elements are partially swallowed by the black hole .",
    "this effect is less important at high metallicities , because most metals escape in a stellar outflow before the collapse to a black hole . in order to include these findings , at least in an approximate manner ,",
    "we have used interpolated maeder s results for case c ( minimum mass for formation of the black hole equal to 22 @xmath9 ) yields . for a salpeter",
    "imf the value of the yield agrees with the one obtained from arnett s results at metallicity @xmath205% of solar , but it is smaller for lower metallicities .",
    "we have done numerical runs of our models using both prescriptions and we found differences of the order of 30% in the final metallicity .    a particularly important quantity depending on the imf is the number of sne per unit mass of stars formed , @xmath153 . for a salpeter imf with @xmath189 and @xmath190 , we obtain @xmath206 .",
    "it is worth pointing out , though , that @xmath153 is rather sensitive to the adopted value of @xmath207 .",
    "finally , we are making the hypothesis that the oxygen abundance in the outflow is the same as in the ism , we are not considering metal - enhanced outflows .",
    "the reason for this assumption is the following .",
    "mf have determined , in addition to the gas ejection efficiency as discussed in the previous section , the metal ejection efficiency per sb in a dwarf galaxy , @xmath208 .",
    "let us consider a typical case among the ones simulated in their paper , @xmath209 , @xmath210 , for which they obtain @xmath211 and @xmath212 .",
    "if the amount of heavy elements produced per sn is @xmath213 , then during the energy injection phase lasting @xmath214  myr , about @xmath215 of metals are diluted with the ejected gas , if mixing between the two components is fast enough .",
    "this corresponds to an increase in the metal abundance of the outflow of @xmath216 , which is at least comparable if not smaller , than the typical abundances of dis , as can be appreciated by inspecting our control sample in tab .",
    "1 . this should demonstrate that metal enhanced outflows can be produced only in the very early stages of the evolution .",
    "in addition the above argument does not take into account the interaction with the hot cavity gas which strengthens this conclusion .",
    "of course , if all the metals produce in a sb escape from the galaxy as in the case just considered , there would be no way for the galaxy to become metal enriched .",
    "however , the results of mf allow to conclude that the metal enrichment is mostly due to low - luminosity sbs and/or isolated sne , which do not blowout and for which @xmath208 is strongly reduced .",
    "finally , we consider the kinetic energy balance , eq . [ sig ] . as we have seen in previous sections , sne and sbs",

    "the general trend of increasing surface brightness with gas mass is successfully reproduced as well as the typical range of values . given the assumptions made",
    ", we do not emphasize this result any further .",
    "as a final remark , one has to keep in mind that the extrapolation of the empirical relation eq .",
    "[ monl ] to the mass range relevant to the least massive dwarfs is at this stage only very tentative .",
    "the upper points in the figure are all `` bursts '' , or bcd type galaxies , which are likely to possess faint underlying halos which have not been included in the surface brightness measures , making it an upper limit .",
    "as we argue several times in this paper , these burst episodes affect only mildly the global evolutionary properties of dwarfs , although the increased luminosity during these periods might allow their detection at cosmological distances ( see section 6 ) .",
    "the presence of dm profoundly influences the star formation history of dwarf galaxies .",
    "its main influence is on the processes regulating the star formation rate is via the compression of the cool gas in a deeper gravitational potential , thus increasing the mean gas density .",
    "we have computed the star formation rate for galaxies with different gas masses ( @xmath314 ) and values of @xmath315 .",
    "our model assumes that galaxies are evolving in a relatively undisturbed manner , as we are not considering any external ( or internal ) perturbation which could trigger vigorous star forming episodes .",
    "the behavior of the star formation rate in time for the set of model galaxies above is shown in fig .",
    "the rates tend to decrease in time as the gas is either consumed by star formation ( predominantly ) or lost in the outflow .",
    "the variation of the gas mass is relatively modest though , being within a factor 2 - 3 of the initial value , independently of the amount of dm . as more dm",
    "is added , it increases the star formation rate .",
    "_ for a @xmath316 the star formation rate is in the range @xmath317 , depending on the evolutionary stage and on its dark - to - visible mass ratio_.      the sfh obtained by tolstoy ( 1998 ) for leo  a is shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ( solid curve ) . essentially one major star formation episode ( @xmath318  yr@xmath12 ) appears to have occurred about 1.5 gyr ago lasting 0.6  gyr , preceded by a long lasting low level of star formation similar to that observed today .",
    "this older star formation activity is poorly constrained by current data . for the long - lasting ( @xmath319  gyr ) interval before the burst , only an upper limit of about @xmath320  yr@xmath12 can be set .",
    "this is broadly consistent with variations about a constant ( but low ) level .",
    "we make two comparisons with our models .",
    "we input the tolstoy sfh for leo  a into our model , and predict the resulting metallicity .",
    "we also compare the sfh and the final metallicity predicted by our model with the gas mass and dark - to - visible mass ratio taken from the observations of leo  a , independently of what is known about the sfh .",
    "for the first case we obtain the metallicity evolution for leo  a ( see bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) . in order for the final metallicity ( @xmath321 = 7.2\\pm 0.1 $ ] ) to agree with the observed value ( @xmath321 = 7.3\\pm 0.1 $ ] , it is necessary to assume that in the latency period star formation has proceeded at a rate equal to the upper limit set by observations ( @xmath318  yr@xmath12 ) ; a lower level of star formation would underproduce the observed oxygen abundance .",
    "alternatively , one could possibly explain the metallicity of the galaxy by postulating an extremely early burst , in the first 2 gyr , which can not be detected by present observations .",
    "given these uncertainties , we show only the fit to the data that is based on available data . the combined metallicity evolution ",
    "cmd information clearly provides useful constraints on the sfh in galaxies ; thus , it will be interesting in the future to check if more sensitive observations will allow to decide between the two above possibilities .    next",
    ", we have run our code with the standard prescriptions , without assuming the sfh is known _ a priori _ , for the specific case of leo  a. we obtain a metallicity @xmath321 = 7.38 $ ] .",
    "of course , the derived sfh differs from the inferred one ( an obvious consequence of the fact that we have not attempted to allow for significant variations in star formation rate ) , but it apparently approximates the mean of the one inferred from observations and we regard this as a success of the model .",
    "the model presented in this paper provides a consistent , interpretation of the behavior and properties of dwarf galaxies . however , it is important to discuss the uncertainties associated with our analysis .",
    "there are at least three quantities that we consider poorly constrained and which might influence our results : _",
    "( i ) _ the hi radius - mass relation , _",
    "( ii ) _ the strength of the magnetic field and _ ( iii ) _ the oxygen chemical yield .",
    "various authors have found / used different dependences of the hi radius of dwarfs as a function of their hi mass .",
    "for example , matteucci & chiosi ( 1983 ) from a linear fit of a sample containing 45 bcd / di galaxies derived the dependence @xmath322  kpc ( using the same factor of 2 as here for the hi - optical radius conversion ) .",
    "although the coefficient @xmath76 is roughly similar , the curve is sensibly steeper .",
    "a detailed study by salpeter & hoffman ( 1996 ) of 70 bcds / dis yielded a slope @xmath323 for the relation between the geometric mean of the outermost hi radius and the optical radius and the hi mass . the van zee sample , which is biased towards low surface brightness objects , has an even flatter slope , @xmath324 .",
    "clearly these measures are difficult as they depend on the ability to trace extended hi distributions . in spite of these uncertainties ,",
    "it is reassuring to find an excellent agreement between our adopted relationship eq .",
    "[ rc ] and the one derived from the independent sample of 49 spiral galaxies with extended hi disks by broeils & van woerden ( 1994 ) .",
    "the comparison between the data and the analytical relation eq .",
    "[ rc ] ( not a fit ! ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] and , although the latter has been derived from a sample of dwarf galaxies , it clearly holds for larger objects .",
    "our models are only mildly affected by this uncertainty . as a rule of thumb , larger values of @xmath325 with respect to the one adopted here ( 0.338 ,",
    "[ rc ] ) would produce a flatter metallicity ",
    "mass / luminosity relation ; a larger @xmath76 would instead shift such a relation towards smaller metallicities . correlation statistics based on larger samples are needed to completely clarify this issue .",
    "we have also predicted the existence of a tight relation between gas velocity and metallicity in dwarfs ( it is interesting to note that an analogous relationship has been recently found between the stellar velocity dispersion and metallicity in four dsphs by richer 1999 ) .",
    "the agreement with the data is very good , particularly if a kinetic energy dissipation during cloud collisions by about a factor of 2 is allowed .",
    "this can be easily achieved , under a variety of collision conditions ( ranging from adiabatic to radiative cases ) if a magnetic field is present .",
    "the elasticity of the collision ( defined as the ratio of the final to the initial kinetic energy of each cloud ) is enhanced by the above required factor 2 for a magnetic pressure equal to about 1/4 of the gas pressure in the ism ( miniati 1999 ) ; we recall that this ratio in the galaxy is around unity .",
    "our knowledge of the magnetic field strength and configuration in dwarfs is still relatively scarce .",
    "the most complete survey aimed at the determination of the b strength in dwarf lsbs has been presented by klein ( 1992 ) .",
    "these authors , using effelsberg 100-m observations at 4.75 ghz , report typical b strengths @xmath326 g for seven dis in their sample .",
    "although this conclusion is subject to several caveats due to the assumptions made to derive it , klein conclude that these galaxies are probably a scaled down version of normal spirals as far as their radio - continuum properties are concerned .",
    "chyzy etal ( 1997 ) used the vla to obtain power and polarization maps of two dis ( ngc4449 and ic10 ) and they were able to probe the existence of large scale magnetic field patterns , although of uncertain strength .",
    "theoretically , one would expect magnetic fields of lower strength in dwarfs galaxies than in spirals as dynamo amplification ought to be less efficient due to the lower rotation speeds .",
    "thus , a factor of 4 lower magnetic pressure in dwarfs , as required by the best fit to the velocity dispersion - metallicity data , is certainly reasonable and suggested by observations , although additional intense experimental efforts will be necessary in the future .",
    "the oxygen yield from massive stars must still be considered as uncertain in spite of a number of recent detailed studies ( arnett 1978 , woosley & weaver 1986 , thielemann 1992 , maeder 1992 ) .",
    "a nice comparison among the predictions of different theoretical models concerning this quantity can be found in wang & silk 1993 ( see fig",
    ". 1 of their paper ) .",
    "all models are in satisfactory agreement on the yields from stars with masses @xmath327 , but they differ by up to a factor @xmath328 for stars as massive as 80 @xmath9 , depending on the metallicity .",
    "this difference , as already pointed out above , is due to the poorly known mass loss rate dependence on metallicity for massive stars and to the possible formation of a black hole .",
    "fortunately , this variability range is much narrower when integration over a reasonable imf is performed , due to the rapid decrease of the number of very massive stars .",
    "nevertheless , the adopted maeder yields depend on metallicity and a comparison of our results with the ones obtained using the older arnett prescriptions still produces a discrepancy of about 30% in the final oxygen abundance of the galaxy .",
    "this should be kept in mind when interpreting the comparison of our models with the data .",
    "in addition to the uncertainties outlined , either caused by a experimental difficulties and/or by a limited theoretical understanding of various processes , there are obvious limitations and shortcomings of the present model .",
    "maybe the most evident one is the lack of an attempt to model the possible occurrence of enhanced star formation periods ( starburst ) during the evolution of the di galaxies studied here .",
    "the motivation for this choice is twofold .",
    "theoretically , the origin and characteristics of starbursts phenomena are not well understood : a large number of studies have tried to model these phenomena with limited success ; it is beyond the frame of this work to review them properly .",
    "observationally , there is no clear evidence that the majority of dis go through starburst phases and that starbursts produce relevant evolutionary effects in addition to the ones produced by the underlying more quiescent star formation activity .",
    "the issue is nicely reviewed by meurer ( 1999 ) who pointed out that the observed central surface brightness of bursting dis is well below the one measured in bcds : this indicates that di starbursts are not even intense enough to be recognized as starbursts in many cases .",
    "in addition , a considerable fraction of bcds ( about 20% ) shows no structural evidence ( they have nearly exponential @xmath77 and flat color profiles ) for starbursts . finally , as we have pointed out repeatedly here and in mf , the fractional ism loss is modest even in starbursting prototypes as ngg1705 ( meurer 1992 ) .",
    "these remarks suggest that neglecting the role of starbursts is not seriously affecting the results presented here for dwarf galaxies , as also witnessed by the correct reproduction of the metallicity range observed for these objects .",
    "outflows rates of the order predicted here ( @xmath329  yr@xmath12 ) may be traced and studied by x - ray and optical emission - line studies .",
    "detailed numerical simulations by mf have shown that gaseous halos with sizes of tens of kpc are produced , with regions of high x - ray emissivity close to the galactic disk .",
    "relatively cool , dense filaments also occur near the galaxy , well within the external shock , due to shell fragmentation , which are detectable by high spatial resolution experiments .",
    "in fact , the bulk of the observed x - ray emission may come from conductive interfaces associated with these structures , in which the emission is particularly enhanced by nonequilibrium effects .",
    "detection via absorption line studies towards background objects such as qsos has been also demonstrated ( bowen 1997 ) .",
    "of course this type of experiment is limited by the low column densities in a large , rarefied halo , as well as the availability of suitably located , sufficiently bright , background objects , which are scarce for small dwarf galaxies .",
    "if these difficulties can be overcome , this technique might provide unique information about the physical conditions prevailing in the outflows , and more generally , in dwarf halos .",
    "the results obtained in this study , together with previous theoretical and observational work , allow us to sketch a global evolutionary scenario for dwarf galaxies .    according to standard hierarchical models of structure formation ,",
    "the star formation activity in the universe started with the formation of the so - called pop iii objects ( couchman & rees 1986 , ciardi & ferrara 1997 , haiman 1997 , tegmark 1997 , ferrara 1998 , ciardi , ferrara & abel 1999 ) at redshift @xmath330 .",
    "these are small ( total mass @xmath331 or baryonic mass @xmath332 ) objects characterized by virial temperatures , @xmath333 , below the critical one ( @xmath334  k ) at which the cooling necessary for the collapse can not be provided by hydrogen lines ( mostly ly@xmath325 line radiation ) , and molecular hydrogen is then , in a primordial plasma , the only efficient cooling agent . translating the critical virial temperature into a total mass we obtain @xmath335 , where @xmath31 is the virialization redshift . in order for collapse to take place",
    "it is required that the cooling time ( whatever species is providing it ) is shorter than the hubble time at the epoch of virialization .",
    "this defines a second critical mass , @xmath336 , which has been calculated by tegmark ( 1997 ) . as a results only objects more massive than @xmath337 can indeed collapse and form luminous objects .",
    "the situation is somewhat complicated by feedback effects , involving the photodissociation of molecular hydrogen in pop iiis due to radiation , possibly created by neighbor sources .",
    "this prevents a fraction of objects , in spite of their mass being larger than @xmath337 , from collapsing .",
    "the strength of the feedback depends very much on the intensity of the radiation field and this involves detailed modelling out of the scope of this paper ( these calculations are presented in ciardi 1999 ) ; neglecting this complication is not crucial for the argument we make here .",
    "the redshift evolution of both @xmath338 and @xmath337 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] .",
    "we can now compare these two masses with the ones derived for local dwarfs .",
    "the total masses of the best studied dsphs ( mateo 1993 present the cases for 9 local group dsphs ) range from @xmath339 ( carina ) up to @xmath340 ( ngc205 ) . according to the previous definition @xmath341 ,",
    "some of them can be classified as pop iiis , whereas the more massive ones probably belong to the class of objects able to cool via ly@xmath325 .",
    "clearly , as @xmath338 is redshift dependent , the classification depends on the formation epoch .",
    "the majority of pop iii objects can only live very short lifes due to their fragility , and the dramatic feedback effects which can be induced by only a handful of sne ; their fate is inevitably a sudden death after the first star formation episode ( which in most cases only involved the production of @xmath342 of stars ) and their leftover is a tiny naked stellar cluster without gas ( but with dm ) , which could possibly be incorporated in larger structures .",
    "the ones which escape merging could still be seen in the nearby universe , although their expected extremely low luminosity should make their detection very challenging .",
    "is the absence of gas in these objects produced by blowaway in the early stages of their evolution ?",
    "the possibility that des are remnants of blown away popiii objects has been proposed by miralda - escud & rees ( 1997 ) . the results found here might suggest that this interpretation faces a mass discrepancy problem : we found that blowaway can occur only for total masses below @xmath343 , which is several times smaller than the values derived by mateo for dsphs .",
    "one has to keep in mind that this value has been derived by assuming galaxy properties derived from observations of present day dwarfs and it implies that gaseous dwarfs , like dis , with larger masses can not transform into des _ in the future_. however , the conditions at the formation , as the size , gas density , dark - to - visible mass ratio , of dwarfs progenitors were probably very different . in particular , the critical mass for blowaway is extremely sensitive ( @xmath344 ) to the level of turbulent motions in the ism ; finally , these quantities depend on the formation redshift and cosmological model",
    ". this discrepancy might be solved by putting the blowaway problem in a cosmological context .",
    "in fact , specific predictions for the cold dark matter model with @xmath345 , have been made by ciardi ( 1999 ) who found that the critical mass for blowaway can be increased up to approximately 1 - 2 times @xmath338 .",
    "although some uncertainty remains on the correct value of @xmath162 as a result of the poorly known formation properties of galaxies , it is clear that blowaway is a very likely event in these small objects .",
    "this explanation is also favored by current galaxy formation scenarios .",
    "for example , klypin ( 1999 ) notice that most popular cosmological models would overpredict the number of low mass satellites in halos of galaxies like our own by a factor of about 4 with respect to what is observed .",
    "theory can be brought in agreement with observations if it is assumed that these missing satellites are dark , invisible due to their faintness as a result of gas ejection and quenching of star formation .",
    "similar conclusions are reached also by ciardi ( 1999 ) who find that a consistent number of dark objects should be created as a byproduct of early galaxy formation .",
    "additional support for the occurrence of blowaway has been brought by an interesting approach recently developed by hirashita ( 1998 ) .",
    "these authors noted that a discontinuity is seen in the dependence of the virial mass / luminosity ratio ( analogous to our @xmath35 parameter ) on the virial mass in a sample of local dsph at @xmath346 .",
    "they interpret this discontinuity as produced by blowaway , as low mass objects having lost most of their baryons would be characterized by high values of @xmath347 .",
    "in addition to blowaway , other processes may be able to sweep away the galaxy ism .",
    "photoionization , either produced by external ( barkana & loeb 1999 ) or internal ( lin & murray 1992 , norman & spaans 1997 , spaans & norman 1998 ) sources , might have an important impact on the evolution of dwarfs .",
    "if a uv background ( uvb ) , produced by qsos and galaxies , is present it might even suppress the formation of dwarfs ( babul & rees 1992 , efstathiou 1992 , thoul & weinberg 1996 , nagashima 1998 ) . the common physical process on which these two ideas are based is that as the gas is photoionized , it is also heated to a temperature that exceeds the virial temperature of the halo itself and can not be confined by the galaxy gravitational potential .",
    "the photoionization temperature of a moderately dense gas is , for a large range of properties of the radiation field and medium density , @xmath348  k. thus , the critical mass relative to photoionization effects essentially coincides with @xmath338 : of course , this is not surprising as both temperatures are regulated by ly@xmath325 line cooling , which is an excellent thermostat .",
    "hence , dsphs must form before a consistent uvb is present in order to be able to accrete the gas , before reionization ; subsequently they can lose it when the uvb intensity has increased . in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] the obliquely dashed region shows the mass - redshift parameter space were the formation of luminous objects regulated by the processes described above is allowed .",
    "the mass bounds of the shaded region are determined by the upper and lower mass limits of the 9 dsphs of the mateo ( 1993 ) sample , whose total mass values are superimposed ( clearly , we do not know the virialization redshift of these objects ) .",
    "the first conclusion that we can draw from the figure is that objects like carina , sculptor , sextans , uminor , and draco are indeed pop iii objects which must have formed before @xmath349 due to their low masses .",
    "then at reionization , for which we have assumed the conservative lower redshift limit @xmath350 , they must have lost their gas either by photoevaporation or blowaway .",
    "an exception is represented by sculptor in which a limited amount of hi ( @xmath351 ) has been detected ( carignan 1998 ) .",
    "this gas is located at the edge of the galaxy optical image and its association with the galaxy is not completely clear .",
    "this gas could have been either part of a self - shielded and hence neutral intergalactic clump , or accreted recently thanks to the drop in the uv background , or igm pressure confined ejected gas .",
    "larger objects ( fornax , ngc147 ) could have formed at redshifts much closer that the reionization one and photoevaporated shortly after .",
    "ngc 185 and ngc 205 are instead consistently found to have some gas ( young & lo 1997 ) .",
    "this interpretation still has to face the question why dis with total masses similar to dsphs ( for a comparison see tab . 1 and 2 ) yet are gas rich . if they have lost their gas in the past , they must have reaccreted material relatively recently when the uvb intensity dropped .",
    "environmental effects might play a role here , as we must require that dis populate regions where gas accretion is more easily achieved than in those where dsphs of the same mass are found .",
    "whatever process ( blowaway / photoionization ) is setting the mass value @xmath162 for gas ejection , might this fact be responsible for the separation between late type and early type dwarfs ?",
    "in other words , is it possible that these two galaxy types had common progenitors in the past but they evolved along different evolutionary paths determined by their mass and hence by their ability to retain their gas ?",
    "this is certainly an intriguing possibility which would solve the problems caused by a di @xmath7 de transition occurring later on .",
    "if , as in the latter case , the transition has to be catalyzed by an intense stellar activity expelling the gas , then we should look at bcds as objects on the point of being transformed into des .",
    "there are several , apparently insurmountable , difficulties associated with this interpretation , which can be briefly summarized as follows : although bcds have clear similarities with dis , however they have _ ( i ) _ higher surface brightness , _",
    "( ii ) _ larger radii with respect to dis ( patterson & thuan 1996 ) ; in addition , van zee ( 1997a , b ) point out that bcds have higher central mass concentration in both gas and stellar content .",
    "even the second step of the di @xmath7 bcd @xmath7 de chain is problematic : the rotation curves of dis are noticeably different from the ones of both des and bcds , their kinematics being dominated by chaotic motions ( ferguson & bingeli 1994 ) .",
    "the alternative scenario proposed here , in which di @xmath7 de transitions do not occur but these objects , starting from the same progenitors , have followed different evolutionary tracks , does not suffer from the above problems .",
    "in our view , bcds would be simply represent a `` normal '' tail of the distribution of dwarfs massive enough to escape both blowaway / photoevaporation , in addition characterized by higher central mass density which favors the onset of occasional starbursts .",
    "the consistency of our results for leo  a between effectively constant star formation rate over time and `` bursty '' behaviour shows that the properties of di and bcd galaxies can be understood as fluctuations about a mean which is broadly constant / slowly decreasing , value with time . bursts of star formation can happen easily in these small galaxies , but they do not last long enough to dramatically overwhelm the long term effects of low - level , but constant star formation , which is likely to represent the dominant mode of star formation ( see also tolstoy 1996 , cole 1999 , gallagher 1998 ) .",
    "intense bursts of star formation can make these small galaxies visible at cosmological distances , and their short duration can make the number density consistent with that of the faint blue galaxy population seen at intermediate redshifts ( e.g. tolstoy 1998a ) . the great diversity of properties of nearby dwarf galaxies ( e.g. mateo 1998 , toltoy 1998b ) indicates that star formation rates can and do fluctuate noticeably on short timescales .",
    "it is also clear , however , that there must be regulatory feedback processes , presumably like those presented here , which effectively average out these fluctuations over periods of several hundred million years .",
    "although this is seemingly a long time on the timescale of an individual hii region , it is a more reasonable timescale for fluctations in the ism and it is a negligible fraction of the lifetime of a galaxy .",
    "we have studied the role of stellar feedback produced by massive star formation and dm on the evolution of dwarf galaxies .",
    "the main results are the following :    @xmath352 the entire gas content of a dwarf galaxy can be blown away if its total mass is @xmath353 ; outflows occur in dwarfs with gas masses up to @xmath354 .",
    "larger galaxies are not predicted to have a net mass loss , although a local circulation of gas via a fountain - type flow is possible .",
    "these conclusions closely agree with the results of mf .",
    "@xmath352 even in the presence of an outflow , the predominant mechanism of gas consumption is the conversion of gas into stars .",
    "we conclude that outflows are affecting the properties of dwarfs only weakly .",
    "@xmath352 for a given visible galactic mass , the dm content correlates with the gas metallicity ; from the available data we conclude that metallicities are consistent with a dark - to - visible mass ratio in dis @xmath355 .",
    "we predict the existence of a lower limit for the oxygen abundance in dis 12+log(o / h ) @xmath356 .",
    "@xmath352 outflow rates from galaxies , when they occur , are in the range @xmath301  yr@xmath12 ; the mass loss is a rather steep function of gas mass peaking at @xmath302 ; these objects are therefore the major pollutants of the igm .",
    "@xmath352 the hi velocity dispersion correlates with metallicity : independently of the dm content we predict that @xmath357 .",
    "this relationship is found to agree nicely with the available data , particularly if about 1/4 of the ism pressure is contributed by magnetic fields .",
    "@xmath352 for the specific case of the nearby di leo a , we forced the sfh of the galaxy to be the one experimentally derived from cmd studies ; with this prescription our model correctly reproduces the observed metallicity of the galaxy .",
    "if the sfh is instead modelled as in the rest of the paper , the final metallicity is equally well in agreement with the data .",
    "@xmath352 based on our results , we discuss a scenario in which late type and early type dwarfs had common progenitors in the past , but the different total ( mostly dark ) mass produced a different evolution , governed by the combined effects of blowaway of the gas and photoionization .",
