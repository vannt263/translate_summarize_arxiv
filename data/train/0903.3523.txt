    "this theory has proven to be highly successful over the past sixty years , and has accurately described a disparate range of physical phenomena over a wide range of energies , from scattering of charged particles in high energy colliders to the low energy dynamics of atoms in electromagnetic fields . the theory which , in its microscopic form , describes the interaction of electromagnetic fields with charged particles , predicts the appearance of nonlinear processes when high intensity fields interact with certain types of matter . however , owing to the complexities associated with the microscopic structure of matter , the calculation of such properties are highly involved and often neglect some of the more complicated features .",
    "for example , in such calculations absorption is almost always neglected . as a result",
    "the standard approach to nonlinear optical processes is , in the main , phenomenological and , although it provides a good approximation at high intensities @xcite , does not necessarily hold for all situations .",
    "furthermore , there are several circumstances where nonlinear absorption is thought to be a critical factor @xcite and hence the standard approach is insufficient in these cases .",
    "it is certainly the case that absorption plays an important role in many physical processes .",
    "recently , a method for consistently quantizing the electromagnetic field in absorbing linear electric and magnetic materials has been developed ( for reviews , see e.g. refs .",
    "there have been some attempts to extend this theory to nonlinear materials @xcite , however , as yet a full theory has proven to be elusive .    in this article",
    "we present an extension of the linear quantum theory of light in absorbing media to nonlinear processes . in the following we will consider , as an example , the second order process of parametric down conversion , where an input ( pump ) photon is converted by a nonlinear medium to give two output photons ( signal and idler ) whose frequencies sum to that of the input photon .",

    "this equation can be formally solved using the green tensor for the helmholtz operator @xmath6 the green tensor @xmath7 solves the helmholtz equation with a point source @xmath8    quantization is then performed by relating the noise polarization field to a set of bosonic field operators @xmath9 and imposing canonical commutation relations for them , @xmath10 = \\bm{\\delta}(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{s})\\delta(\\omega-\\omega').\\ ] ] thus the frequency components of the quantized electric field can be written as @xmath11 and the total field operator reads @xmath12 the bosonic operators @xmath13 and @xmath14 describe collective excitations of the electromagnetic field and the absorbing dielectric material and can be viewed as the generalization of the free space photonic mode operators to arbitrary media .",
    "the bilinear hamiltonian @xmath15 generates the time - dependent maxwell equations from heisenberg s equations of motion for the electromagnetic field operators .",
    "this quantization scheme has already been successfully applied to a wide range of linear media including magnetic and magnetodielectric materials and has been used to study many physical effects including spontaneous relaxation rates , atom surface interactions and various cavity qed processes @xcite .",
    "starting with this theory , it is possible to study nonlinear interactions of light with an atom in the presence of dielectric bodies . here , one solves the coupled equations of motion recursively to obtain an expansion in powers of the electric field operator .",

    "we are interested in the process of parametric down conversion where the frequencies of the incoming and outgoing photons combine such that @xmath50 .",
    "terms on the rhs whose frequencies of evolution deviate significantly from the above condition will oscillate rapidly in comparison to the resonant terms .",

    "( [ sigma2 ] ) that satisfy @xmath50 . as a result",
    "we neglect terms which contain the annihilation operator @xmath37 .",

    "lastly terms with @xmath34 represent the free ( undriven ) motion of the atom in the background field and hence are not of interest here .",
    "the physical motivation for these approximations comes from the nature of the parametric down conversion process itself .",
    "the condition @xmath50 is a statement of energy conservation .",
    "hence there is no energy available to drive atomic transitions and thus the atom must stay in its initial state .",

    "note here that the coupling constants @xmath53 are not functions of time and hence can be taken out of the integral .",

    "lastly the atomic operators @xmath51 are the projection operators on to the energy eigenstates of the atomic hamiltonian and hence stationary under evolution by the atomic hamiltonian .",

    "the nonlinear coupling tensor operator depends solely on the projection operators @xmath51 on to the atomic eigenstates .",
    "since their evolution is now static , @xmath61 , we can replace them by their expectation values @xmath62 .",
