    "ferrimagnets are systems composed of different spins , mostly of two types ( @xmath3 ) @xcite . many of ferromagnetic materials are essentially ferrimagnets@xcite .",
    "it is a special class of spin models with much attraction in low dimension where their universality class is completely different from homogeneous spin models @xcite .",
    "antiferromagnetic chain of spin @xmath2 models are gapless ( gapped ) for half - integer ( integer ) spins@xcite .",
    "however ferrimagnetic chains behave differently .",
    "the low energy spectrum of a ferrimagnetic chain ( @xmath7 ) is gapless with ferromagnetic order and a gapped band above it which has antiferromagnetic properties@xcite .",
    "this effect causes a crossover from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic behavior at finite temperatures @xcite .",
    "spin wave theory gives an explanation for low temperature physics of ferrimagnetic chains@xcite .",
    "however , it is valid for temperatures smaller than the classical energy scale ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "it is our task to obtain the physics of ferrimagnets systematically at moderate ( where quantum corrections are important ) and higher temperatures .",
    "cumulant expansion ( ce ) @xcite is our approach to this problem . recently",
    "this approach has been implemented to study finite temperature behavior of homogeneous large spin systems@xcite .",
    "it has been observed that cumulant expansion converges in a region @xmath9 which is wider than corresponding one in the high temperature series expansion and even overlaps the validity regime of spin wave theory for homogeneous spin systems .",
    "we have generalized the application of cumulant expansion to ferrimagnetic models . in this approach",
    "we obtain a quasiclassical hamiltonian for a ( @xmath3 ) system . the effective hamiltonian which is a function of classical variables takes into account the quantum corrections systematically in the order of ( @xmath0 ) where @xmath2 is the smaller value of ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the partition function is calculated by using the effective hamiltonian to get physical properties .",
    "apart from the effective hamiltonian for a general ( @xmath10 ) ferrimagnets we found that the n - th order effective hamiltonian contains correlation of ( @xmath11)-sites . moreover , for nearest neighbor interaction in ferrimagnetic chain , the first order effective hamiltonian is composed of 2-sites correlation .",
    "consequently the results of ce for a single molecule of ( @xmath3 ) is the same as one dimensional interacting molecules .",
    "we have also found that in the convergence region , the gas model is a good representation of a chain of interacting molecules up to 2nd order expansion .",
    "it is remarkable that in the special case @xmath12 , our results match the recent studies on homogeneous spin chains @xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we have introduced the cumulant expansion in spin coherent state representation .",
    "the effective hamiltonian and partition function of two sites gas model are derived in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we have derived the effective hamiltonian of ferrimagnetic chain and then the physical properties .",
    "results and discusion have been demonstrainted in sec.[sec5 ] where we have presented some physical quantities of a chain with nearest neighbor interaction .",
    "the cumulant of n operators or classical variables ( @xmath13 ) is defined as @xcite & & a_1  a_n^c + & & =  e^_1a_1+_2a_2+  |___1=",
    " = _ n=0 [ ce1 ] where @xmath14 means averaging over a classical distribution function or a quantum state@xcite .",
    "it is easy to show that in case of all @xmath13 equal to @xmath15 , one will arrive at the following equality , e^a = e^a-1 ^c .",
    "[ ce2 ] to do so , multiplying by @xmath16 and summing over @xmath17 is performed .",
    "let us show the cumulant of few cases in terms of usual averaging .",
    "a^c&=&a , a_1 a_2^c = a_1a_2- a_1a_2 + a_1 a_2 a_3^c&=&a_1 a_2 a_3-a_1a_2 a_3^c -a_2a_1 a_3^c + & -&a_3a_1 a_2^c - a_1a_2a_3[ce3 ]    it is obvious from eq.([ce3 ] ) that the cumulant of two or more operator contains correlations of them . it is a characteristic property of quantum mechanics that the expectation value of a product of two operators is different from the product of expectation values ( @xmath18 , whereas the equality is valid in classical limit ) . this is the correlation of two operators which is inherited from the quantum state in which the expectation is calculated .",
    "so we expect to obtain a quasiclassical description by using cumulants . in this respect",
    "we are going to obtain an effective ( quasiclassical ) hamiltonian in terms of cumulants which contain quantum corrections .",
    "the partition function ( @xmath19 ) of a spin system can be expressed in the basis of spin coherent states @xmath20 ; i.e. states with the maximum - spin projection on the axis pointing in the direction of unit vector @xmath21 [ ] .",
    "the basis of coherent states are overcomplete , so it contains all quantum states .",
    "the classical state of a spin is achieved in the limit @xmath22 .",
    "the unity operator in this representation is    = d*n * |*n*| .",
    "[ ce4 ] the trace of an operator in a single spin problem can be written as : tr(a)&=&_m m|a|m = d*n*_m m|a|*n*|m + & = & d*n*|a|*n*. [ ce5 ]    so the partition function of a system of @xmath23-spins defined by the hamiltonian @xmath24 , is as the following , z=_i=1^n ( ) d*n*_i _ 1 _ n|e^-",
    "|*n*_1 _ n[ce6 ] where @xmath25 ( choosing @xmath26 ) .",
    "if we define e^-_1 _ n|e^-| * n*_1 _ n[ce7 ] then the partition function is the same as a classical one . using eq.([ce2 ] )",
    ", the effective hamiltonian is expressed in terms of cumulants .",
    "= _ 1 _ n|1-e^-| * n*_1 _ n^c [ ce8 ] the above equation can be expanded in the following form by a taylor expansion . &",
    "= & ^c-^c + ^c+ + & = & ( h^(0)+h^(1)+h^(2)+ ) [ ce9 ] thus the effective hamiltonian ( @xmath27 ) can be considered as a systematic expansion in terms of cumulants of powers of @xmath24 .",
    "the first term ( @xmath28 ) is the pure classical contribution and higher orders are responsible for quantum corrections .",
    "in fact this is an expansion in powers of ( @xmath0 ) where @xmath2 is the smaller spin of ( @xmath3 ) in a ferrimagnetic chain,(it will be shown in next sections ) .",
    "this expansion is justified whenever @xmath9 . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "a high temperature expansion for mixed spin systems ( @xmath3 ) is still missing in the literature .",
    "however to make a qualitative comparison we consider the homogeneous case @xcite ( @xmath29 ) . in this case",
    "the convergence region of ce ; i.e @xmath30 , is larger than the typical high temperature expansion @xcite which is @xmath31 . as we will see in next sections ce",
    "can also be interpreted as an expansion of @xmath32 .",
    "so for large spin ferrimagnets the range of convergence is wide .",
    "let us first consider an ideal gas - noninteracting - of ferrimagnetic molecules ( gas model ) where each molecule composed of two spins ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the interaction between spins in all molecules is either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic given by the following hamiltonian . =",
    "j * s*_1_2 ,  j>0 [ ts1 ] where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are spin operators of size @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively .",
    "the ( @xmath37 ) sign stands for ferromagnetic ( f ) and ( @xmath38 ) for antiferromagnetic ( af ) interaction .",
    "there are two reasons to study the gas model .",
    "firstly , it is exactly solvable , so we will compare the results of cumulant expansion with the exact ones to infer the accuracy of our method .",
    "secondly , we would like to address the connection of this model to a chain of interacting ferrimagnetic molecules ( next section ) .",
