    "a key question in nuclear structure research is the persistence of so - called magic numbers when moving away from stability .",
    "nuclei near closed shells are important testing grounds for shell - model theories and have therefore attracted considerable experimental and theoretical research interest .",
    "a particularly interesting region is around the magic number of @xmath8 protons , as it ranges from the doubly - magic @xmath4ni on the neutron - deficient side of the nuclear chart towards the neutron - rich doubly magic @xmath9ni , 14 isotopes away from stability .",
    "furthermore , it includes the semi - magic sub - shell closure at @xmath5 , which is related to the parity change between the @xmath6 shell and the @xmath10 orbital @xcite .",
    "the nickel region has been investigated extensively in the last decade both theoretically and experimentally . on the neutron - deficient side ,",
    "where protons and neutrons occupy the negative - parity @xmath6 orbits , it has been shown experimentally  @xcite and theoretically  @xcite that the @xmath4ni core is rather soft .",
    "excitations of protons and neutrons across the @xmath11 shell closure from the @xmath12 orbital into the higher @xmath6 orbits are needed to reproduce the magnetic moments of the @xmath13 states in the even @xmath14ni isotopes  @xcite .",
    "of special interest in the region are the ground - state properties of the copper isotopes , which are dominated by a single proton coupling to the underlying nickel core .",
    "magnetic moment measurements of odd - a cu isotopes have been performed over a very broad range , from @xmath2 up to @xmath15=46  @xcite . on the neutron - deficient side , excitations of nucleons from the @xmath12 orbit across the spin - orbit magic numbers",
    "@xmath11 are needed to reproduce the observed moments for the @xmath16 ground states  @xcite , as shown by the calculations in the full @xmath6-shell @xcite . on the neutron - rich side ,",
    "the inversion of the ground - state structure from @xmath16-dominated to @xmath17-dominated was established by the measured ground - state spins of @xmath18cu  @xcite . in this region",
    "the strong interaction between the @xmath19 protons and the @xmath10 neutrons plays a crucial role @xcite .",
    "this has been taken into account in two effective shell - model interactions which span the @xmath20 model space ( often abbreviated as the @xmath21 model space ) based on a @xmath4ni core @xcite , and which reproduce the odd @xmath22cu magnetic moments fairly well  @xcite .",
    "however , an increasing deviation was observed towards @xmath23cu , which is suggested to be due to missing proton excitations across @xmath8 .",
    "indeed , calculations starting from a @xmath24ca core can reproduce nearly perfectly the experimental odd - a cu magnetic moments beyond @xmath5 @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we report on the measured magnetic moments and quadrupole moments of isotopes between @xmath0cu and @xmath1cu . the moments and spins of nuclear ground and long - lived isomeric states",
    "were determined using high - resolution collinear laser spectroscopy . with this method ,",
    "each of these observables could be deduced in a model - independent way from the measured hyperfine spectra in the transition for atomic copper .",
    "a review of recent developments on laser spectroscopy can be found in @xcite . in order to extend the measurements towards the neutron - deficient and neutron - rich sides of the valley of stability",
    ", the sensitivity of the optical detection has been enhanced by more than two orders of magnitude , by using a bunched ion beam produced with the recently installed gas - filled linear paul trap ( iscool )  @xcite .",
    "the data are compared to shell - model calculations using a @xmath4ni core .",

    "[ qpqn ] the calculated proton and neutron contributions ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) to the spectroscopic quadrupole moments are shown for the two interactions ( values given in table [ tabq ] ) . from fig .",
    "[ qpqn ] it is seen that the proton quadrupole moments of configurations dominated by a @xmath16 proton are rather constant across the chain , which illustrates that in this case the proton - neutron correlation does not strongly affect @xmath25 . in the neutron - rich isotopes , dominated by a @xmath17 ground - state configuration , the proton quadrupole moment is more sensitive to this proton - neutron interaction .",
    "the trend is the same for both interactions , though the absolute proton quadrupole moments are slightly larger with jj44b . for the neutron quadrupole moments , a significant difference between the two calculations",
    "is seen in the region of the @xmath5 sub - shell gap . while both calculations show a strong core polarization when adding neutrons to @xmath2 or removing them from @xmath3 , the reduction at @xmath5 is more pronounced for the jj44b interaction .",
    "the strong increase in core polarization beyond @xmath5 , observed for the jj44b interaction , is missing for the jun45 interaction .",
    "this is an indication that the @xmath5 gap is too small in the jun45 effective interaction .    in fig .",
    "[ figoddquadrupole1 ] the experimental values are compared to calculated spectroscopic quadrupole moments .",
    "a reasonable agreement is observed for both calculations .",
    "the trend is however better reproduced by the jj44b interaction , which is clearly related to the stronger core - polarizing effect in the neutron quadrupole moments .",
    "when neutrons are added or removed from @xmath5 , the experimental moments reveal a strong core - polarization effect .",
    "this core polarization is similar on both sides of @xmath5 : the @xmath27cu and @xmath28cu spectroscopic quadrupole moments are the same within error bars . no increased collectivity is observed on the neutron - rich side , as suggested by recent measurements of the @xmath29(e2 ) transition rates in the underlying nickel isotopes @xcite . in order to compare the core polarization in @xmath1cu to that of the other copper isotopes ,",
    "we calculate the core quadrupole moment .",
    "this is done by taking the difference between the spectroscopic ( experimental or calculated ) value ( @xmath30 ) and the single particle moment ( @xmath31 ) for the odd proton :    @xmath32    the single particle quadrupole moment ( @xmath31 ) for the @xmath33 states is taken as the calculated effective moment for @xmath34cu , while the @xmath35 single particle moment is the calculated effective value for @xmath36cu .",
    "indeed , these isotopes have no valence neutrons and thus @xmath37 ( see table [ tabq ] for values from jj44b and jun45 ) .",
    "the deduced experimental and calculated core polarizations are shown in fig .",
    "[ qcore ] .",
    "the experimental core polarization in @xmath1cu is the same as in @xmath38cu , so again no enhancement of collectivity is observed towards the neutron rich isotopes .",
    "the jj44b interaction reproduces very well the trend in the core polarization .",
    "it seems to slightly overestimate the core polarization in @xmath1cu , but data on the more neutron - rich isotopes are needed to confirm this . towards the neutron - deficient side , the core polarization seems underestimated in @xmath0cu .",
    "however , a more precise experimental value and more precise determination of the effective proton charge is needed to establish this firmly . for the jun45 interaction , the core polarization",
    "is largely underestimated in all isotopes away from @xmath39cu , both when adding and when removing neutrons from @xmath5 .",
    "adjusting the effective charges does not improve the agreement with experiment .",
    "the structure of the even - a copper isotopes is dominated by the coupling between the odd proton in one of the @xmath40 orbits and an unpaired neutron in one of the available neutron orbits .",
    "this is illustrated well by comparing the experimental @xmath7-factors for the 1@xmath41 , 2@xmath41 and @xmath42 states in @xmath43cu with empirical values calculated with the additivity relation for moments @xcite , using experimental @xmath7-factors of neighboring even - odd nickel and zinc , and odd - even copper isotopes :    @xmath44    -factors of the ground states of @xmath43cu ( table [ tabmuq2 ] , solid circles ) are compared with empirical @xmath7-factors using the additivity relation for simple proton - neutron configurations .",
    "the positive sign of the @xmath45cu value reveals a strongly mixed ground - state wave function . ]    for example , the possible empirical moments for the 1@xmath41 state in @xmath45cu for a @xmath16 coupling to a @xmath46 , @xmath47 or @xmath48 , are calculated using the experimental @xmath49 factors of the 1/2 , 3/2 and 5/2 states in zn @xcite and for @xmath50 the average was taken between the @xmath7-factors of @xmath51cu and @xmath52cu . as shown in fig .",
    "[ empiricalgfactors ] , the comparison of these empirical @xmath7-factors with the experimental values provides an indication for the purity of the state .",
    "@xmath53cu and @xmath54cu are clearly dominated by a @xmath55 configuration , while @xmath56cu and @xmath57cu have a dominant @xmath58 structure , as already concluded in @xcite .",
    "the sign of the @xmath45cu @xmath7-factor was determined to be positive , in contrast to the literature value ( see table [ tabmuq2 ] ) .",
    "this illustrates that @xmath45cu has a strongly mixed ground state , with a significant occupation of the @xmath46 orbital .",
    "the @xmath59 states in @xmath60cu and @xmath61cu show a @xmath62 character , as expected . for the neutron - rich isotopes",
    "@xmath63cu , the ground - state spin was measured to be @xmath64 @xcite , and from the measured negative sign of the magnetic moment it was concluded that the ground state must have a dominant @xmath65 configuration . indeed , the empirical magnetic moment of this configuration is in agreement with the observed value ( see fig .  [ empiricalgfactors ] ) .    in @xmath66cu",
    "the experimental @xmath7-factors of the @xmath67 and @xmath68 states are consistent with a proton in the @xmath69 level coupled to a neutron in the @xmath10 orbit ( compare @xmath70 and @xmath71 to the experimental values in table [ tabmuq2 ] ) .",
    "this configuration gives rise to a ( 3,4,5,6)@xmath72 multiplet , where the @xmath68 state forms the ground state in @xmath61cu and is isomeric in @xmath73cu , due to excitation of a neutron across the @xmath5 shell gap .",
    "the energies of these isomeric states are thus a good probe for the strength of the @xmath5 shell gap . in fig .",
    "[ evenculevels ] we compare the lowest experimental energy levels with the calculated level schemes for both interactions . due to the very high level density , especially in the neutron - rich isotopes , only the lowest experimental levels and the relevant calculated ones",
    "are shown for clarity .    with the jun45 interaction , the energy of the @xmath68 level in @xmath60cu",
    "is calculated about 300 kev below the observed value . in @xmath45cu",
    "this level is calculated even 500 kev below the experimental value ( at 661 kev , compared to 1154 kev experimentally ( not shown in figure ) ) .",
    "this supports the assumption that the @xmath5 gap is too small in the jun45 interaction .",
    "the energies of the @xmath68 levels calculated with jj44b are respectively 826 and 899 kev , which are 100 kev above and 250 kev below the experimental level energies in @xmath74cu .",
    "note that for most of the odd - odd isotopes neither theory predicts the correct level to be the ground state . in order to compare the calculated moments to the experimental ones ,",
    "we have taken the calculated values from the lowest level with the correct spin ( indicated by a bold line in fig .  [ evenculevels ] ) .",
    "for @xmath75cu the experimental moments were best reproduced with the jun45 interaction by the moments for the second @xmath42 level @xcite .",
    "this illustrates the strong sensitivity of nuclear moments to the exact composition of the wave function .",
    "that level has a dominant ( @xmath76 ) configuration , while the lowest @xmath42 level has a dominant @xmath77 configuration , with moments that do not agree with the observed value @xcite .",
    "the fact that the @xmath78 level at 645 kev is the real ground state , suggests that in the jun45 interaction the effective single particle energy of the @xmath17 level is probably too high in @xmath79cu .",
    "-factors for the odd - odd cu isotopes ( full dots ) compared to calculations .",
    "the nuclear spin is added to distinguish between the different isomers in @xmath80cu ( experimental values from table [ tabmuq2 ] ) .",
    "good agreement is obtained , except for the @xmath45cu 1@xmath41 ground state . ]    in fig .",
    "[ evengfactors ] the measured @xmath7-factors are compared to the results from calculations with the jj44b and jun45 interactions .",
    "the jj44b interaction is very successful in predicting the @xmath7-factor trend for the odd - odd cu isotopes , both for gs and isomeric states .",
    "the agreement with the jun45 results is also reasonable . only for the @xmath45cu ground state",
    ", the two theories significantly overestimate the observed value . as can be concluded from the empirical @xmath7-factors in fig .",
    "[ empiricalgfactors ] , this is because a too large @xmath46 contribution is predicted to occur in the wave function .",
    "such a contribution is certainly present , but not as much as given by the shell - model calculations .",
    "finally , we compare the quadrupole moments of the odd - odd cu isotopes with the calculated values from both models , as shown in fig .",
    "[ evenquadrupole ] .",
    "the same effective charges have been used as for the odd - a cu isotopes .",
    "the jj44b interaction successfully reproduces all quadrupole moments , except for those of the @xmath42 levels in @xmath63cu where the deviation is somewhat larger .",
    "the jun45 interaction calculates the quadrupole moments fairly well , but it gives a wrong sign and too large a magnitude for the quadrupole moment of the @xmath45cu gs . this is in line with the @xmath7-factor trend , where it was concluded that the @xmath46 occupation in @xmath45cu is overestimated in this calculation .",
    "an increased @xmath46 occupation allows for enhanced neutron pairing correlations in the @xmath81 levels and so for extra collectivity , leading to too large a quadrupole moment .",
    "in summary , the technique of collinear laser spectroscopy in combination with the iscool buncher , has been successfully applied to determine the spin , magnetic and quadrupole moments of the ground states and long - lived isomeric states in the @xmath82cu isotopes with some yields as low as 10@xmath83 pps .",
    "the @xmath7-factors and quadrupole moments of the odd - a cu isotopes show an apparent magic behavior at @xmath5 , which is strongly related to the parity change between the @xmath6 shell orbits and the @xmath10 level . therefore this magic behavior can not be interpreted only in terms of the energy gap at @xmath5 .",
    "the experimental results have been compared to large - scale shell - model calculations starting from a @xmath4ni core , using two effective shell - model interactions with protons and neutrons in the @xmath84 model space . on both sides of @xmath5 ,",
    "the calculations overestimate the measured magnetic moments of the odd - a cu isotopes . because spin - flip excitations of the type @xmath85 have a very strong influence on the magnetic moment of a state , even if this configuration contributes only one percent to the wave function @xcite , the overestimated @xmath7-factors are an indication that excitations across @xmath86 , @xmath2 should be included in the model space .",
    "the collectivity and the onset of core polarization between @xmath2 and @xmath3 has been probed by the quadrupole moments of the odd - a cu ground states .",
    "no sign of an increased collectivity in @xmath87cu as compared to @xmath88cu has been observed , contrary to what was concluded from b(e2 ) measurements in the ni isotopes .",
    "extending quadrupole moment measurements towards @xmath34cu and @xmath36cu could provide more information about the softness / stiffness of the @xmath4ni and @xmath9ni cores .",
    "comparison of the experimental core quadrupole moments with the calculated ones shows that the jj44b interaction correctly reproduces the observed core polarization when moving away from @xmath5 , while the jun45 interaction systematically underestimates the onset of collectivity .",
    "the moments of the odd - odd cu isotopes are very sensitive to the proton - neutron interaction and configuration mixing , and provide a more severe test to the calculations .",
    "the jj44b interaction reproduces very well ( within a few % ) all of the observed magnetic and quadrupole moments of odd - odd cu isotopes , while for the jun45 interaction less , but reasonable agreement was found . only for the @xmath45cu",
    "gs both models fail to reproduce correctly the data .",
    "note , however , that the level with moments agreeing best with experimental values , is the lowest calculated level with the correct spin .",
    "this is not always the calculated ground state . in @xmath75cu",
    "it is even the second @xmath42 level that agrees with the observed gs moments calculated with jun45 .",
    "thus , through the measured moments , a particular configuration can be assigned to the gs wave functions .",
