    "the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) is expected to collide the first proton beams in 2007 .",
    "this machine has been designed to reach c.m .",
    "@xmath0 collision energies of 14 tev and integrated luminosities of the order of 100 fb@xmath1 per year ( even higher c.m .",
    "energies will be reached in the ion - ion collision modes ) .",
    "such a proton collider is the best instrument we can conceive , to our present knowledge , to explore the behavior of nature at the energy scale of order 1 tev or , correspondingly , at length scale of order @xmath2 cm , that is about 1/10 the ones explored so far at past and present accelerators .",
    "the project is extremely challenging , and costly , too .",
    "it is requiring an incredible effort in different fields by a very large number of people .",
    "then , in order to justify such an effort , one would like to have a sort of _ theoretical guarantee _ on its discovery potential .",
    "the point i will try to make in my talk is about what we expect to learn from this machine from a theoretical point of view",
    ". the outcome will be that we may be approaching a _ revolution _ in our understanding of the physics of fundamental interactions .",
    "in order to better assess the quality of our expectations for new physics at lhc , it can be useful to recall the theoretical expectations in 1981 , that is just before the starting of the cern ppbar collider , where proton - antiproton collisions would have been realized at the initial unprecedented c.m .",
    "energy of 540 gev . at that time , on the basis of a huge amount of experimental data , the standard model ( sm ) of fundamental interactions had been built up .",
    "this was the end of a long and elaborated process whose final milestones were    * 1966/67 unified description of the weak and electromagnetic interactions by a gauge theory based @xmath3 on the group @xmath4 by weinberg and salam ; * 1971 1.5 cm proof of the renormalizability of the theory by thooft and veltman ; * 1973 1.5 cm discovery of neutral currents at cern ; * 1979 1.5 cm nobel prize to weinberg , salam and glashow .",
    "the outcome of the process was a very solid and predictive theory that described _ observed _ interactions .",
    "new particles were predicted at the starting of the ppbar collider : the vector bosons @xmath5 and @xmath6 , the higgs boson and the top quark . at the same time , in the 70 s , the quantum chromo - dynamic ( qcd ) was developed to describe the strong interactions",
    ". one basic prediction of the theory was the asymptotic freedom , giving rise to the plethora of new phenomena connected to jet physics , also to be tested at the ppbar collider .",
    "altogether the physics expectations at the ppbar collider at its starting time were solid and quite well defined .",
    "what are instead the present expectations , about three years before the starting of lhc ?",
    "the sm got incredibly strengthened after about 25 years of more and more accurate experimental tests , not only at the ppbar collider , but also at lep , tevatron , and lower - energy experiments .",
    "we know today that the model based on the gauge group @xmath7 is @xmath8 _ the _ theory that correctly describes the fundamental interactions up to energy scales @xmath9 gev ( or down to length scales @xmath10 cm ) .",
    "there is just one missing part : the conclusive test of the mechanism of the electro - weak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) .",
    "the higgs boson has not yet been observed . on the other hand , in recent years ( especially at lep ) , we got crucial experimental informations on the higgs sector .",
    "first of all , we know that the sm higgs boson must be heavier than 114.4 gev ( at 95%c.l . ) , as established from direct searches at lep through the process @xmath11 @xcite . a crucial , and totally independent from the latter , piece of information arises by imposing the consistency of the sm radiative - correction pattern in the precision - measurement sector .",
    "-2.5 cm    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , the present status of the fit of the sm radiative corrections to the electroweak precision measurements at high @xmath12 is shown @xcite .",
    "apart from @xmath6-pole data , it includes tevatron measurements of @xmath13 and the top mass , and the contribution to @xmath14 of the hadronic vacuum polarization .",
    "the outcome of this fit is a lower limit on @xmath15 that is milder than the direct limit , and , most importantly , a higher limit of 237 gev ( at 95%c.l . )",
    "@xcite , that is quite tighter than the theoretical upper limit in the minimal sm @xmath16 gev @xcite .",
    "the fact that the high accuracy of the electroweak measurements ( in many cases of the order of a few per mil ) translates into a not - so - narrow range for @xmath15 arises from the mild @xmath17 dependence of the sm radiative pattern .",
    "a few comments on the quality of the fit are in order .",
    "although in general one can state a good agreement with the sm predictions , there are areas that manifest some tension @xcite .",
    "-0.5 cm    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , the @xmath15 values obtained from the most sensitive measurements to @xmath15 is shown .",
    "one can see that both the leptonic asymmetries and @xmath18 tend to favorite @xmath15 values very close to the direct experimental limit , while hadronic asymmetries prefer a larger @xmath15 value .",
    "this effect is even enhanced when considering the two most precise @xmath15 determinations , that come from the lepton asymmetry @xmath19 , as measured by the left - right polarization asymmetry at sld , and the forward - backward asymmetry , @xmath20 , measured in the @xmath21 production at lep . here",
    ", we define as usual @xmath22 , with @xmath23 the left / right - handed @xmath24 fermion coupling to the @xmath6",
    ".    a similar discrepancy can be found in the two determinations of the effective electroweak mixing angle @xmath25 coming from @xmath26 and from @xmath27 , that differ by about 3 standard deviations .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , the results for @xmath25 as determined starting from either all leptonic asymmetries or all hadronic asymmetries ( and their combination ) are compared versus @xmath15 , placing each result at the @xmath15 value that would correspond to the central value of the top mass , @xmath28 @xcite",
    ".    there have been several discussions about the possibility of this tension to be due to some new - physics effect in @xmath29 , since , on the other hand , @xmath26 agrees quite well with the leptonic forward - backward asymmetries measured at lep @xcite . as seen from the fitted values of @xmath30 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] , such new physics would imply an excess in @xmath31 of the order of 25% , and no relevant effect in @xmath32 , which seems to require quite _ ad hoc _",
    "models @xcite .",
    "-0.8 cm    more conservatively , one can think that the @xmath27 is due either to some statistical fluctuation or to some neglected systematics .",
    "then , the general pattern of precision measurements indicates that the sm lagrangian describes coherently the z and w coupling to fermions at the one - loop level , if a higgs boson with mass not too far from the present direct lower limit will be found .",
    "such a higgs boson will definitely be in the realm of the lhc searches , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] , where the significance of the signal corresponding to the production and decay via different channels of a sm higgs boson is shown .",
    "if the higgs boson is there , the lhc is going to unveil it !",
    "is there anything else we can expect to learn at the lhc ?",
    "the answer to this question is crucially connected to another question : do we have today in high - energy physics _",
    "direct _ hints of the existence of new phenomena _ at the tev energy scale _ that are not predicted by the sm ?",
    "we do not , unfortunately !    on the other hand , we are pretty sure to be at the threshold of a revolution in our knowledge of the physics of fundamental interactions .",
    "this is so for purely _ conceptual _ reasons , as i will try to explain in the following .",
    "we know today that the sm is not the _ final _ theory .",
    "it is not , for a number of different reasons .",
    "first of all , the minimal sm does not predict the neutrino mass , that is by now a well - proved experimental fact .",
    "second , and more dramatically , it does not include a quantum description of the gravitational force .",
    "we know that at energy scales near the planck mass ( @xmath33 gev ) , where the gravitational force is expected to become as intense as other interactions , some radical change must enter our description of fundamental interactions .",
    "+ there are then other unsolved problems in the sm , out of which i just list the best known :    * big hierarchy in energy scales ; * missing coupling unification ; * presence of dark matter in the universe ; * matter - antimatter asymmetry in the universe ; * value of the cosmological constant ; * origin of the ( many ) fundamental parameters ( couplings , masses , mixing angles ) ; *     while in general we do not know which is the energy scale relevant for the solution of most of the above issues , the _ hierarchy problem _ is definitely pointing us to new phenomena at the tev scale .",
    "most probably , also the existence of _ dark matter _ in the universe is implying new physics at the same scale .",
    "let us look into the _ hierarchy problem _ first .",
    "this is connected to the instability of the scalar fields under radiative corrections .",
    "the higgs boson is the only elementary scalar field entering the sm .",
    "contrary to other fields describing all the known particles and interactions , that benefit from the protection of symmetry principles , the radiative corrections to scalar fields behave rather wildly with respect to the theory cut - off @xmath34 . in particular ,",
    "the corrections to the higgs - boson mass suffer from quadratic divergences : @xmath35 where the dominant contribution comes from the large top mass . if one wants to extend the validity of the sm up to very large energy scales , like @xmath36 ( where we know that the sm is going to fail ) , or even like a grand - unification - theory ( gut ) scale @xmath37 gev , in order to have a @xmath15 value consistent with experiments ( i.e. , @xmath38 gev ) , a very _ unnatural _ cancellation between the tree - level @xmath15 value and the radiative correction in eq .",
    "( [ ger ] ) must occur .",
    "in particular , if @xmath39 one has to adjust the tree - level value over about 34 digits ! on the other hand , a _",
    "natural _ extension of the sm should imply new phenomena at the scale @xmath40 tev , that quite straightforwardly connects to the ewsb scale .",
    "+ a @xmath0 collider of c.m .",
    "energy 14 tev is the ideal experimental set - up where to explore the characteristics of these new phenomena .    for the last 25 years",
    ", an intense theoretical research has been trying to `` parametrize '' the scale @xmath40 tev in terms of a theoretical model that should be as consistent and predictive as possible .",
    "+ the main strategies adopted imply    * new symmetries ; * new interactions ; * new spacial dimensions ;    or a combination of them .",
    "lep results put strong constraints on the possible structure of the theoretical model .",
    "precision measurements powerfully limit possible contributions to different observables coming from new physics .",
    "if one think of the sm lagrangian as a low - energy effective theory , one expects new physics will contribute with non renormalizable higher - dimension operators .",
    "the most relevant should be the dimension - six operators @xmath41 , with a characteristic scale @xmath42 , that enter the lagrangian via a @xmath43 suppressed coupling @xmath44 where the positive / negative sign refers to constructive / destructive interference with the sm model lagrangian . in table",
    "[ tab:1 ] , in order to be as conservative as possible , only @xmath41 operators that preserve the local and global sm symmetries , and satisfy a criterion of minimal flavor violation ( mfv ) are considered @xcite .",
    "then , one finds that in general @xmath45 tev .",
    ".90% cl limits on the scale @xmath42 ( in tev ) of dimension - six operators @xmath41 for constructive and destructive ( @xmath46 ) interference with the sm contribution ( from @xcite ) .",
    "the limits on the operators relevant to lep1 are derived under the assumption of a light higgs .",
    "[ tab:1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     these limits seem in contradiction with the request of new physics at a scale as low as @xmath40 tev .",
    "actually , they can be translated into quite severe requirements on the model that wants to describe new phenomena at 1 tev .",
    "in particular , one can see that , in order not to conflict with the bound @xmath45 tev , new physics should be _ weakly _ coupled , and should not contribute very much at tree level .",
    "on the other hand , _ strongly _ interacting models seem indeed to be excluded by the dimension - six operator analysis up to scales of the order of 5 to 10 tev .",
    "missing any clear hint from experiments , radically different solutions have been proposed to solve the hierarchy problem connected to the naturalness of the ewsb scale .",
    "* supersymmetry * is one of the oldest @xcite .",
    "it solves the problem of quadratic divergences in the higgs sector by introducing a new symmetry that connects different - spin particle .",
    "the particle spectrum of the sm is doubled , and the properties of convergence of the corresponding field theory are drastically improved . in the limit of exact supersymmetry",
    "( i.e. , degenerate particles of same quantum numbers but spin differing by 1/2 ) , the quadratic divergences of the scalar fields vanish . but exact supersymmetry is not realized in nature .",
    "then , the @xmath47 one - loop corrections become proportional to the splitting in the squared masses of supersymmetric partners .",
    "supersymmetric partner masses of the order of ( 0.1@xmath481 ) tev would naturally solve the ewsb scale problem .",
    "* technicolor * has also been considered as a possible solution to the hierarchy problem for a long time @xcite . in this case , the higgs boson is not an elementary scalar particle , but a condensate of _ technifermions _ hold together by a new ( qcd - like ) very strong interaction , with a scale @xmath49 .",
    "although the basic version of technicolor seems to be disfavored by lep precision measurements , theories with a very slow running of the technicolor coupling ( _ walking technicolor _ ) can evade the lep constraints",
    ".    models with * large compactified extra dimensions * @xcite are quite younger than the previous ones , and attack the hierarchy problem from a completely different side .",
    "the hierarchy between @xmath15 and @xmath36 is dissolved because the latter is not the real gravity interaction scale , that is lowered down to the tev scale . on the other hand , there are new compactified spacial dimensions where the graviton also lives , and where most of the intensity of the  strong \" gravitational interaction corresponding to a lower ",
    "@xmath36 \" is diluted away . in this framework",
    ", one should observe some deviation from the newton law at small interaction distances .    in * little higgs models * @xcite ,",
    "the sm symmetries are enlarged in such a way that the higgs boson becomes a pseudo - goldstone boson , and its mass corrections vanish at one loop . on the other hand ,",
    "the two - loop @xmath15 corrections allow to push @xmath34 up to about 10 tev without giving rise to fine - tuning problems . in this case",
    "the hierarchy problem would be just postponed by an order of magnitude in the energy scale .    in * higgless",
    "extra - dimensional theories * , an extra dimensional component of the gauge field is interpreted as a higgs field @xcite .",
    "although quite fascinating , many of the new models seem anyhow not to fit the electroweak precision constraints . + still further new ideas and possibilities to solve the hierarchy problem could appear before the starting of the lhc .",
    "at present , the most promising way to extend the sm and solve the hierarchy problem is to introduce supersymmetry . this statement is based on many important facts .",
    "first , supersymmetry is potentially able to clear up all the difficulties related to the tev - scale physics :    * it stabilizes the @xmath13-versus-@xmath36 hierarchy ; * it explains the origin of the ewsb ( by the large top - quark yukawa coupling ) ; * it makes the measured couplings at the @xmath13 scale consistent with a gut model ; * it predicts a light higgs boson ( the higgs quartic coupling is fixed by gauge couplings ) ; * it has a delicate impact on the electroweak precision measurements ( virtual supersymmetric effect are suppressed by loops , so that @xmath50 ) ; * it can have a delicate impact on fcnc processes ; * it can naturally explain the origin of the dark matter .",
    "second , supersymmetry is a weakly - coupled theory .",
    "it dramatically improves the convergence of the radiative - correction pattern , and is reliably computable .",
    "it allows accurate and consistent theoretical predictions even at energy scales much higher than 1 tev .",
    "it could be extended up to scales not too far from @xmath36 , or even support the _ desert _ hypothesis , that very ambitiously implies that , after including supersymmetric partners at the tev scale , no new phenomenon appears when increasing the energy up to the gut scale .",
    "the fact that supersymmetry is able to reconcile the sm with a gut model is considered today the most direct phenomenological evidence for supersymmetry .",
    "the value of the electroweak coupling constants @xmath51 and @xmath14 measured at lep evolve up to the gut mass scale @xmath52 into a unified constant @xmath53 that , when evolved back to the @xmath54 scale in the su(3 ) coupling , gives by far a too low value for the strong coupling constant @xmath55 . also , the unification scale @xmath52 would induce a too fast proton decay .",
    "all this can be cured quite naturally by the introduction of supersymmetry with partner masses at the tev scale @xcite .",
    "the coupling evolution slows down , and @xmath55 can match its experimental value , while @xmath52 is increased up to a value consistent with the limits on the proton decay rate .",
    "so far , everything looks perfect with supersymmetry .",
    "but there are two bad points , one on the experimental side and one on the theoretical side , that have weakened up to now the cause for supersymmetry ! after more than 20 years of experimental searches for supersymmetric partners , no positive signal has been detected .",
    "we just got limits on the allowed parameter space .",
    "+ the implications of this fact are somehow made less dramatic by the second bad point : there is a remarkable arbitrariness in the construction of theoretical models for the supersymmetry breaking on which the spectrum of the supersymmetric partners is crucially based .",
    "the only solid constraint comes from the fact that , in order to stabilize the hierarchy @xmath13-versus-@xmath36 , the partner masses should be in the range @xmath56 tev .    anyway",
    ", since we do not want the breaking to spoil the good convergence properties of the theory , the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry should be susceptible to be parametrized by _ soft _ operators , of dimension @xmath57 @xcite @xmath58    this implies introducing 108 new parameters !    in general , in any realistic supersymmetry breaking model , there are two energy scales involved : the supersymmetry breaking scale @xmath59 that is the vev of the relevant auxiliary fields in the supersymmetry breaking sector , and the messenger scale @xmath60 that is associated to the interactions that transmit the breaking to the observable sector ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "the latter give rise to soft terms for the scalar and gaugino masses : @xmath62 these mass parameters have then to be evoluted through the renormalization group equations ( rges ) from the @xmath60 scale down to the tev scale , the one relevant to experiments .",
    "experiment task , after the supersymmetry discovery , will be to determine @xmath60 and the structure of the coefficients @xmath63 .",
    "fcnc constraints imply that squark and slepton with equal quantum numbers are either almost degenerate in mass , or almost diagonal in the yukawa matrices .",
    "different breaking schemes that verify these conditions quite naturally have been proposed : gauge mediation ( gmsb ) ( with quite a low @xmath60 ) @xcite , anomaly mediation ( amsb ) @xcite , gaugino mediation @xcite .",
    "in order to maximize the predictive power by using as few basic parameters as possible , most of the phenomenological studies today have been done in the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model ( cmssm ) , even known as minimal supergravity ( msugra ) @xcite . in this framework , a quite large supersymmetry breaking scale ( @xmath64 gev ) , is transmitted via gravitational interactions ( @xmath65 ) down to a mass splitting in the observable sector of the needed amount ( @xmath66 tev ) .",
    "the coefficient @xmath63 are assumed to be universal , and are parametrized by a common scalar mass @xmath67 and a common gaugino mass @xmath68 at the scale @xmath69 .",
    "furthermore , radiative ewsb is imposed .",
    "indeed , in this model there are two higgs doublets , and one of the higgs scalar mass parameter , @xmath70 , can develop a negative value ( that breaks the electroweak group @xmath4 ) just as an effect of the rges evolution from the high scale down to @xmath13",
    ". from the minimization of the higgs effective potential one gets then the condition @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the ratio of the two higgs vacuum expectation values ( the sign of @xmath73 remains undetermined ) . for not too small @xmath74 values",
    ", one has : @xmath75 with all the parameter meant at low energy . as the result of rges evolution",
    ", one can express the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ electroweakdue ] ) as a linear combination of initial ( high - scale ) squared mass parameters , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , a common trilinear coupling @xmath76 , and @xmath73 .",
    "then , taking into account lep limits on the charginos ( @xmath77 gev @xcite ) and the light higgs boson @xmath78 , the above equation implies a non - trivial cancellation between terms that are individually quite larger that @xmath79 .",
    "a fine - tuning of the order of per cent is already implied by the present experimental limits for the cmssm , as fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] shows @xcite .",
    "one can easily check that the present light higgs - mass limit pushes the squark masses up to quite high values .",

    "are predicted at one loop @xmath81 in order , to be compatible with the limit @xmath80 gev , the one - loop correction implies both a large mixing in the stop sector and a heavy stop mass , @xmath82 gev .    these tensions with",
