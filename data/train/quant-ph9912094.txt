    "it has become a clich to say that coherent states abound in quantum physics @xcite .",
    "moreover , it turns out that they can also be applied in the theory of quantum deformations @xcite and even in the theory of classical dynamical systems @xcite .    in spite of the fact that the problem of the quantization of a particle motion on a sphere is at least seventy years old",
    ", there still remains an open question concerning the coherent states for a particle on a sphere .",
    "indeed , the celebrated spin coherent states introduced by radcliffe @xcite and perelomov @xcite are labelled by points of a sphere , i.e. , the elements of the configuration space .",
    "on the other hand , it seems that as with the standard coherent states , the coherent states for a particle on a sphere should be marked with points of the phase space rather than the configuration space .",
    "the aim of this work is to introduce the coherent states for a quantum particle on the sphere @xmath0 , labelled by points of the phase space , that is the cotangent bundle @xmath1 .",
    "the construction follows the general scheme introduced in @xcite for the case of the motion in a circle , based on the polar decomposition of the operator defining via the eigenvalue equation the coherent states . from the technical point of view",
    "our treatment utilizes both the barut - girardello @xcite and perelomov approach @xcite .",
    "namely , as with the barut - girardello approach the coherent states are defined as the eigenvectors of some non - hermitian operators . on the other hand , in analogy to the perelomov formalism",
    "those states are generated from some `` vacuum vector '' , nevertheless in opposition to the perelomov group - theoretic construction , the coherent states are obtained by means of the non - unitary action .    in section 2",
    "we recall the construction of the coherent states for a particle on a circle .",
    "sections 36 are devoted to the definition of the coherent states for a particle on a sphere and discussion of their most important properties . for an easy illustration of the introduced approach we study in section 7 the case with the free motion on a sphere .",
    "in this section we recall the basic properties of the coherent states for a particle on a circle introduced in @xcite .",
    "consider the case of the free motion in a circle .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we assume that the particle has unit mass and it moves in a unit circle .",
    "the classical lagrangian is @xmath2 so the angular momentum canonically conjugate to the angle @xmath3 is given by @xmath4 and the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath5 evidently , we have the poissson bracket of the form @xmath6 implying accordingly to the rules of the canonical quantization the commutator @xmath7 = i,\\ ] ] where we set @xmath8 .",
    "the operator @xmath9 does not take into account the topology of the circle and ( 2.5 ) needs very subtle analysis . the better candidate to represent",
    "the position of the quantum particle on the unit circle is the unitary operator @xmath10 @xmath11 indeed , the substitution @xmath12 does not change @xmath10 , i.e.  @xmath10 preserves the topology of the circle .",
    "the operator @xmath10 leads to the algebra @xmath13 = u,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is unitary . consider the eigenvalue equation @xmath14 using ( 2.7 ) and ( 2.8 ) we find that the operators @xmath10 and @xmath15 are the ladder operators , namely @xmath16 demanding the time - reversal invariance of representations of the algebra ( 2.7 ) we conclude @xcite that the eigenvalues @xmath17 of the operator @xmath18 can be only integer ( boson case ) or half - integer ( fermion case ) .",
    "we define the coherent states @xmath19 for a particle on a circle by means of the eigenvalue equation @xmath20 where @xmath21 is complex . in analogy to the eigenvalue equation satisfied by the standard coherent states",
    "@xmath22 @xcite with complex @xmath23 , of the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the standard bose annihilation operator and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the position and momentum operators , respectively , we set @xmath28 hence , making use of the baker - hausdorff formula we get @xmath29 we remark that the complex number @xmath21 should parametrize the cylinder which is the classical phase space for the particle moving in a circle .",
    "the convenient parametrization of @xmath21 consistent with the form of the operator @xmath30 such that @xmath31 arises from the deformation of the circular cylinder by means of the transformation @xmath32 the coherent states @xmath19 can be represented as @xmath33 the coherent states satisfy @xmath34 where the maximal error arising in the case @xmath35 is of order @xmath36 per cent and we have the exact equality in the case with @xmath37 integer or half - integer .",
    "therefore , @xmath37 can be identified with the classical angular momentum .",
    "furthermore , we have @xmath38 it thus appears that the average value of @xmath10 in the normalized coherent state does not belong to the unit circle . on introducing the relative average of @xmath10 of the form @xmath39 where @xmath19 and @xmath40 are the normalized coherent states , we find @xmath41 from ( 2.21 ) it follows that that the relative expectation value @xmath42 is the most natural candidate to describe the average position of a particle on a circle and @xmath3 can be regarded as the classical angle .",
    "we remark that the coherent states on the circle have been recently discussed by gonzles _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "in spite of the fact that they formally generalize the coherent states described above , the ambiguity of the definition of those states manifesting in their dependence on some extra parameter , can be avoided only by demanding the time - reversal invariance mentioned earlier , which leads precisely to the coherent states introduced in @xcite . since the time - reversal symmetry seems to be fundamental one for the motion of the classical particle in a circle and makes the quantization unique , therefore the generalization of the coherent states discussed in @xcite which does not preserve that symmetry is of interest rather from the mathematical point of view .",
    "having in mind the properties of the standard coherent states one may ask about the minimalization of the heisenberg uncertainty relations by the introduced coherent states for a particle on a circle . in our opinion , in the case with the compact manifolds the minimalization of the heisenberg uncertainty relations is not an adequate tool for the definition of the coherent states .",
    "a counterexample can be easily deduced from ( 2.7 ) , ( 2.8 ) and ( 2.9 ) . indeed , taking into account ( 2.8 ) and ( 2.9 )",
    "we find that for the eigenvectors @xmath43 s of the angular momentum @xmath18 the equality sign is attended in the heisenberg uncertainty relations implied by ( 2.7 ) such that @xmath44 more precisely , for these states ( 2.22 ) takes the form @xmath45 . on the other hand ,",
    "the vectors @xmath43 s are clearly rather poor candidate for the coherent states . in our opinion",
    "the fact that the coherent states are `` the most classical '' ones is better described by the following easily proven formulae : @xmath46 where the approximations are very good ones .",
    "in fact , these relations mean that the quantum variables @xmath18 and @xmath10 are at practically constant `` distance '' from their classical counterparts @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively , and therefore the quantum observables and the corresponding expectation values connected to the classical phase space are mutually related .",
    "we point out that in the case with the standard coherent states for a particle on a real line we have the exact formulae @xmath49 it seems to us that the approximative nature of the relations ( 2.23 ) and ( 2.24 ) is related to the compactness of the circle .",
    "our experience with the case of the circle discussed in the previous section indicates that in order to introduce the coherent states we should first identify the algebra adequate for the study of the motion on a sphere . the fact that the algebra ( 2.7 ) referring to the case with the circle @xmath51 is equivalent to the @xmath52 algebra , where @xmath53 is the group of the plane consisting of translations and rotations , @xmath54={\\rm i}\\varepsilon_{\\alpha\\beta}x_\\beta , \\qquad [ x_\\alpha , x_\\beta]=0,\\qquad \\alpha,\\,\\beta=1,\\,2,\\ ] ] realized in a unitary irreducible representation by hermitian operators @xmath55 where the casimir is @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the anti - symmetric tensor , indicates that the most natural algebra for the case with the sphere @xmath0 is the @xmath50 algebra such that @xmath58={\\rm i}\\varepsilon_{ijk}j_k,\\qquad [ j_i , x_j]={\\rm i } \\varepsilon_{ijk}x_k,\\qquad [ x_i , x_j]=0,\\qquad i,\\,j,\\,k=1,\\,2,\\,3.\\ ] ] indeed , the algebra ( 3.4 ) has two casimir operators given in a unitary irreducible representation by @xmath59 where dot designates the scalar product . therefore , as with the generators @xmath60 , @xmath61 , describing the position of a particle on the circle , the generators @xmath62 , @xmath63 , can be regarded as quantum counterparts of the cartesian coordinates of the points of the sphere @xmath0 with radius @xmath64 .",
    "we point out that unitary irreducible representations of ( 3.4 ) can be labelled by @xmath64 and the new scale invariant parameter @xmath65 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath66 is simply the projection of the angular momentum @xmath67 on the direction of the radius vector of a particle .",
    "since we did not find any denomination for such an entity in the literature , therefore we have decided to call @xmath66 the _ twist _ of a particle .",
    "let us now recall the basic properties of the unitary representations of the @xmath50 algebra .",
    "the @xmath50 algebra expressed with the help of operators @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , takes the form @xmath72 & = & 2j_3,\\qquad [ j_3,j_\\pm]=\\pm j_\\pm,\\\\ { } [ j_\\pm , x_\\mp ] & = & \\pm 2x_3,\\qquad [ j_\\pm , x_\\pm]=0,\\qquad [ j_\\pm , x_3]=\\mp x_\\pm,\\\\ { } [ j_3,x_\\pm ] & = & \\pm x_\\pm,\\qquad [ j_3,x_3]=0,\\\\ { } [ x_+,x_- ] & = & [ x_\\pm , x_3]=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] consider the irreducible representation of the above algebra in the angular momentum basis spanned by the common eigenvectors @xmath73 of the operators @xmath74 , @xmath68 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 @xmath77 where @xmath78 . recall that @xmath79 the operators @xmath80 and @xmath70 act on the vectors @xmath73 in the following way : @xmath81 an immediate consequence of ( 3.9 ) is the existence of the minimal @xmath82 satisfying @xmath83 thus , it turns out that in the representation defined by ( 3.9 ) the twist @xmath66 can be only integer or half integer .",
    "we finally write down the orthogonality and completeness conditions satisfied by the vectors @xmath73 such that @xmath84 is the identity operator .",
    "now , an experience with the circle indicates that one should identify by means of the @xmath50 algebra an analogue of the unitary operator @xmath10 ( 2.6 ) , representing the position of a particle on a sphere . to do this ,",
    "let us recall that a counterpart of the `` position '' @xmath85 on the circle @xmath51 is a unit length imaginary quaternion which can be represented with the help of the pauli matrices @xmath86 , @xmath63 , as @xmath87 where @xmath88 .",
    "notice that @xmath89 is simply an element of the @xmath90 group and it is related to the @xmath91 quotient space .",
    "therefore the most natural choice for the `` position operator '' of a particle on a sphere is to set @xmath92 where @xmath62 , @xmath63 obey ( 3.4 ) and ( 3.9 ) and we have omitted for convenience the imaginary factor i. furthermore , let us introduce a version of the dirac matrix operator @xcite @xmath93 observe that @xmath94 making use of the operators @xmath95 and @xmath96 we can write the relations defining the @xmath50 algebra in the space of the unitary irreducible representation introduced above as @xmath97_+ & = & { \\rm tr}kv,\\\\ v^2&=&i,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath98 , and the subscript `` + '' designates the anti - commutator . in particular , @xmath99 it should also be noted that in view of ( 4.4 ) and ( 4.5_c _ ) @xmath95 satisfies the unitarity condition @xmath100 .",
    "we now introduce the vector operator @xmath101 generating , via the eigenvalue equation analogous to ( 2.10 ) , the coherent states for a particle on a sphere @xmath0 .",
    "the experience with the circle ( see eq .  ( 2.13 ) ) suggests the following form of the `` polar decomposition '' for the matrix operator counterpart @xmath30 of the operator @xmath101 : @xmath102 indeed , it is easy to see that in the case of the circular motion in the equator defined semiclassically by @xmath103 and @xmath104 , @xmath30 reduces to the diagonal matrix operator with @xmath30 given by ( 2.13 ) and its hermitian conjugate on the diagonal .",
    "furthermore , using ( 4.5_b _ ) we find @xmath105 motivated by the complexity of the problem we now restrict to the simplest case of the twist @xmath106 when ( 4.8 ) takes the form @xmath107 in the following we confine ourselves to the case @xmath106 .",
    "the general case with arbitrary @xmath108 will be discussed in a separate work . besides ( 4.9 ) we have also remarkably simple relation ( 4.5_b _ ) referring to @xmath106 such that @xmath109_+ = 0.\\ ] ] notice that the case @xmath106 is the `` most classical '' one .",
    "indeed , the projection of the angular momentum onto the direction of the radius vector should vanish for the classical particle on a sphere .",
    "it should also be noted that in view of ( 3.10 ) @xmath17 s and @xmath110 s labelling the basis vectors @xmath73 are integer in the case of the twist @xmath111 .",
    "we finally point out that the condition @xmath106 ensures the invariance of the irreducible representation of the @xmath50 algebra under time inversions and parity transformations which change the sign of the product @xmath112 . clearly demanding the time - reversal or the parity invariance when @xmath108 one should work with representations involving both @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "we now return to ( 4.7 ) . making use of ( 4.10 ) and the fact that the matrix operator @xmath95 in view of ( 4.2 ) is traceless one we obtain for @xmath106 @xmath115 hence , @xmath116 taking into account ( 4.9 ) we get from ( 4.12 ) @xmath117 and @xmath118=0,\\qquad i , j=1,\\,2,\\,3.\\ ] ] as with ( 4.2 ) describing in the matrix language the position of a quantum particle on a sphere",
    ", the matrix operator ( 4.12 ) can be only interpreted as a convenient arrangement of the operators @xmath119 generating the coherent states , simplifying the algebraic analysis of the problem .",
    "accordingly , we define the coherent states for a quantum mechanics on a sphere in terms of operators @xmath119 , as the solutions of the eigenvalue equation such that @xmath120 where in view of ( 4.13 ) @xmath121",
    ". what is @xmath101 ? using ( 4.7 ) , ( 4.2 ) , ( 4.3 ) and setting @xmath106 , we find after some calculation @xmath122 we remark that @xmath119 have the structure resembling the standard annihilation operators .",
    "in fact , one can easily check that it can be written as a combination @xmath123 of the `` position operator '' @xmath124 and the `` momentum '' @xmath125 , where the coefficients @xmath126 and @xmath127 are functions of @xmath128 .",
    "we finally point out that derivation of the operator @xmath101 ( 4.16 ) without the knowledge of the matrix operator @xmath30 seems to be very difficult task .",
    "in this section we construct the coherent states specified by the eigenvalue equation ( 4.15 ) . on projecting ( 4.15 ) on the basis vectors @xmath129 and using ( 3.7_a _ ) , ( 3.8 ) and ( 3.9 ) with @xmath106 we arrive at the system of linear difference equations satisfied by the fourier coefficients of the expansion of the coherent state @xmath130 in the basis @xmath131 .",
    "the direct solution of such system in the general case seems to be difficult task .",
    "therefore , we adopt the following technique .",
    "we first solve the eigenvalue equation for @xmath132 , and then generate the coherent states from the vector @xmath133 using the fact ( see ( 4.16 ) ) that @xmath101 is a vector operator . as demonstrated in the next section the case with @xmath134 refers to @xmath135 and @xmath136 , where @xmath137 is the position and @xmath138 the angular momentum , respectively , i.e. , the particle resting on the `` north pole '' of the sphere .",
    "let us write down the eigenvalue equation ( 4.15 ) for @xmath134 @xmath139 using the following relations which can be easily derived with the help of ( 4.16 ) , ( 3.7_a _ ) , ( 3.8 ) and ( 3.9 ) with @xmath111 : @xmath140 it can be easily checked that the solution to ( 5.1 ) is given by @xmath141 now , using the commutator @xmath142=-{\\rm i}{\\bi w}\\times{\\bi z},\\ ] ] where @xmath143 , we generate the complex rotation of @xmath101 @xmath144 taking into account ( 5.5 ) and ( 4.15 ) we find that the coherent states can be expressed by @xmath145 is given by @xmath146 it thus appears that the coherent states can be written as @xmath147    generated analogously as in the case of the circle described by the equation ( 2.16 ) .",
    "the formula ( 5.8 ) can be furthermore written in the form @xmath148 where @xmath149 finally , eqs .",
    "( 5.9 ) , ( 5.3 ) , ( 3.7_a _ ) and ( 3.8 ) taken together yield the following formula on the coherent states : @xmath150 where @xmath151 and @xmath152 are expressed by ( 5.10 ) and @xmath153 . taking into account the identities @xmath154 @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the hypergeometric function , @xmath157 are the gegenbauer polynomials and",
    "@xmath158 is the gamma function , we obtain @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the sign of @xmath110 .",
    "let us recall in the context of the relations ( 5.14 ) that the polynomial dependence of the projection of coherent states onto the discrete basis vectors , on the complex numbers parametrizing those states is one of their most characteristic properties .",
    "clearly , the polynomials ( 5.14 ) should span via the `` resolution of the identity operator '' the fock - bargmann representation .",
    "we recall that existence of such representation is one of the most important properties of coherent states .",
    "the problem of finding the fock - bargmann representation in the discussed case of the coherent states for a particle on a sphere is technically complicated and it will be discussed in a separate work . finally , notice that the coherent states @xmath130 are evidently stable under rotations .",
    "we now show that the introduced coherent states for a quantum particle on a sphere are labelled by points of the classical phase space , that is @xmath1 . referring back to eq .",
    "( 4.16 ) and taking into account the fact that the classical limit corresponds to large @xmath17 s , we arrive at the following parametrization of @xmath161 by points of the phase space : @xmath162 where the vectors @xmath163 , fulfil @xmath164 and @xmath165 , i.e. , we assume that @xmath138 is the classical angular momentum and @xmath137 is the radius vector of a particle on a sphere . in accordance with the formulae ( 4.15 ) and ( 4.13 ) the vector @xmath161 satisfies @xmath121 .",
    "thus , the vector @xmath161 is really parametrized by the points @xmath166 of the classical phase space @xmath1 .",
    "consider now the expectation value of the angular momentum operator @xmath67 in a coherent state .",
    "the explicit formulae which can be derived with the help of ( 3.7_a _ ) , ( 3.8 ) , ( 3.12 ) and ( 5.14 ) are too complicated to reproduce them herein . from computer simulations it follows that @xmath167 nevertheless , in opposition to the case with the circular motion , the approximate relation ( 6.2 ) does not hold for practically arbitrary small @xmath168 .",
    "namely , we have found that whenever @xmath169 , then ( 6.2 ) is not valid .",
    "note that returning to dimension entities in the formulae like ( 3.6 ) we measure @xmath168 in the units of @xmath170 , so in the physical units we deal rather with @xmath171 .",
    "for @xmath172 the relative error @xmath173 , @xmath63 , is small .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath174 , then @xmath1751 per cent .",
    "in other words , in the case of the motion on a sphere , the quantum fluctuations are not negligible for @xmath1761 @xmath170 and the description based on the concept of the classical phase space is not adequate one .",
    "however , it must be borne in mind that the condition @xmath177 10 @xmath170 , when ( 6.2 ) holds is not the same as the classical limit @xmath178 .",
    "we only point out that @xmath179 .",
    "it thus appears that the parameter @xmath138 in ( 6.2 ) can be identified with the classical angular momentum divided by @xmath170 .",
    "we now study the role of the parameter @xmath137 in ( 6.1 ) . as with the momentum operator",
    "@xmath67 the explicit relations obtained by means of ( 3.9 ) with @xmath106 , ( 3.12 ) and ( 5.14 ) are too complicated to write them down herein .",
    "the computer simulations indicate that @xmath180 it seems that the formal resemblance of the formula ( 6.3 ) and ( 2.19 ) referring to the case with the circular motion is not accidental one .",
    "the range of application of ( 6.3 ) is the same as for ( 6.2 ) , i.e. , @xmath181 .",
    "because of the term @xmath182 , it appears that the average value of @xmath124 does not belong to the sphere with radius @xmath64 .",
    "proceeding analogously as in the case of the circle we introduce the relative average value of @xmath124 of the form @xmath183 where @xmath184 is a coherent state with @xmath185 where @xmath186 is the unit vector along the @xmath187 coordinate axis and @xmath138 is the same as in ( 6.1 ) . in view of ( 6.3 ) and ( 6.4 ) we have @xmath188 therefore , the relative expectation value @xmath189 seems to be the most natural one to describe the average position of a particle on a sphere .    we have thus shown that the parameter @xmath137 can be immediately related to the classical radius vector of a particle on a sphere .",
    "as with the case of the circular motion ( see formulae ( 2.18 ) and ( 2.21 ) ) , we interpret the relations ( 6.2 ) and ( 6.6 ) as the best possible approximation of the classical phase space . in this sense the coherent states labelled by points of such deformed phase space are closest to the classical ones .",
    "the quantum fluctuations which are the reason of the approximate nature of ( 6.2 ) and ( 6.6 ) are in our opinion a characteristic feature of quantum mechanics on a sphere .",
    "we finally remark that the discussion of the heisenberg uncertainty relations analogous to that referring to the circle ( see section 2 ) can be performed also in the case with the coherent states for a particle on a sphere .",
    "for example a counterpart of the formula ( 2.22 ) is @xmath190 where according to eq .",
    "( 4.2 ) we have @xmath191 .",
    "such discussion as well as the detailed analysis of the heisenberg uncertainty relations for the quantum mechanics on a compact manifold will be the subject of a separate paper which is in preparation .",
    "we now illustrate the actual treatment by the example of a free twist 0 particle on a sphere , i.e.  the rotator . the corresponding hamiltonian is given by @xmath192 by ( 3.7_a _ ) the normalized solution of the schrdinger equation @xmath193",
    "can be expressed by @xmath194 determined by ( 5.14 ) and ( 6.1 ) , which gives the probability of finding the system in the state @xmath131 , when the system is in the normalized coherent state @xmath195 , has the following properties . for fixed integer",
    "@xmath196 the function @xmath197 has a maximum at @xmath198 coinciding with the integer nearest to the positive root of the equation @xmath199 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "thus , it turns out that the parameter @xmath200 can be regarded as the energy of the particle .",
    "further , for fixed integer @xmath17 in @xmath201 ( see fig .  2 ) , such that ( 7.5 ) holds , the function @xmath197 has a maximum at @xmath202 coinciding with the integer nearest to @xmath203 .",
    "it thus appears that the parameter @xmath203 can be identified with the projection of the momentum on the @xmath204 axis .",
    "in this work we have introduced the coherent states for a quantum particle on a sphere .",
    "an advantage of the formalism used is that the coherent states are labelled by points of the classical phase space .",
    "the authors have not found alternative constructions of coherent states for a quantum mechanics on a sphere preserving this fundamental property of coherent states . as pointed out in sec .",
    "6 , the quantum fluctuations arising in the case of the motion on a sphere are bigger than those taking place for the circular motion .",
    "this observation is consistent with the appearance of the additional degree of freedom for the motion on a sphere .",
    "we remark that as with the particle on a circle , we deal within the actual treatment with the deformation of the classical phase space expressed by the approximate relations ( 6.2 ) and ( 6.6 ) .",
    "we also point out that besides ( 6.2 ) and ( 6.6 ) the quasi - classical character of the introduced coherent states is confirmed by the behaviour of the distribution of the energies investigated in section 7 .",
    "it seems that the approach introduced in this paper is not restricted to the study of the quasi - classical aspects of the quantum motion on a sphere .",
    "for example , the results of this work would be of importance in the theory of quantum chaos .",
    "in fact , in this theory the kicked rotator is one of the most popular model systems . because of the well known difficulties in the analysis of the heisenberg uncertainty relations occuring in the case with observables having compact spectrum like the position operator @xmath124 satisfying the @xmath50 algebra ( 3.4 ) we have not studied them herein .",
    "the analysis of the heisenberg uncertainty relations as well as the discussion of the case with a nonvanishing twist will be performed in future work .",
