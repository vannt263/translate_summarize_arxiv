    "it was realized more than twenty years ago that in the ambiance of strongly - interacting matter the cross sections for high transverse momentum hadron production will be attenuated .",
    "this phenomenon , dubbed `` jet quenching '' , has attracted tremendous attention from the theoretical and experimental communities  @xcite at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) and has subsequently been extended to heavy flavor production , particle correlations and , most importantly , reconstructed jet observables . within the framework of the traditional parton energy loss approach , however , the accuracy of such theoretical analyses can not be systematically improved .",
    "recent advances in the theory of in - medium parton shower formation allow us to overcome this limitation and to unify our understanding of energetic particle and jet production in hadronic and nuclear collisions .",

    "given the significance of understanding the production of large transverse momentum particles and jets in the ambiance of the qgp , several theoretical formalisms were developed to evaluate the energy loss of quarks and gluons as they propagate through the medium  @xcite as an example , we present below the guuylassy - levai - vitev ( glv ) reaction operator approach where the fully differential medium induced gluon bremsstrahlung intensity is obtained as a series over the multiple scattering correlations in the medium . for gluons with momentum @xmath0 $ ] resulting from the sequential interactions of a fast parton with momentum @xmath1 $",

    "this expectation is now confirmed by the atlas experimental data  @xcite .",
    "further constraints on the modification of the parton shower can be placed through electroweak boson tagging  @xcite and the change in the shape and magnitude of correlation distribution , such as the momentum imbalance @xmath36 .",

    "[ raalhccoupling ] and additional theoretical predictions for these channels have also been confirmed by lhc experimental data .",
    "the next step in improving the theory if leading particles and jets in heavy ion reactions is to employ resummation / evolution techniques where the theoretical control on the accuracy of the evaluation is much improved .",
    "an important step forward was the derivation of all medium - induced splitting functions beyond the soft - gluon ( energy loss ) approximation @xcite .      a critical step in improving",
    "the jet quenching phenomenology is to understand the implication of the finite-@xmath37 corrections .",
    "their implementation requires new theoretical methods , since in the large momentum fraction limit the leading parton can change flavor and the splitting process can not be interpreted as energy loss . a natural language to capture this physics",

    "branching is given by a plus function .",
    "the dglap evolution equations decouple and because the fragmentation functions @xmath44 are typically steeply falling with increasing @xmath45 , the main contribution comes predominantly from @xmath46 .",
    "we expand the integrand in this limit , the analytical solution @xmath47 and shows explicitly that the vacuum evolution and the medium - induced evolution factorize . we have used the following definitions in the above formula : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the medium - induced gluon intensity distribution  @xcite and the connection to the traditional energy loss approach is evident .",
    "conversely , solving the dglap evolution equations with the full medium induced splitting functions allows us to unify the treatment of vacuum and medium - induced parton showers .",

    "we find that the coupling between the jet and the medium can be constrained with better than 10% accuracy when the uncertainties that arise from the choice of method and the fit to the data are combined .",

    "they have also recently become the baseline for studying the in - medium modification of parton showers in ultra - relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "the jet shape is a function of two angular parameters @xmath25 and @xmath54 , which can be at hierarchical scales .",
    "its calculation suffers from large logarithms of the ratio between the two scales , and these phase space logarithms can be conveniently resummed in the framework of soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) .",
