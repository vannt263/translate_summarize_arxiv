    "have been measured for a large number of channels , most notably by babar , belle and lhcb  @xcite , and more is expected to come from lhc run 2 and from belle ii  @xcite .",
    "on the theory side , three - body non - leptonic @xmath0 decays are interesting for several phenomenological applications , such as the study of cp violation and the extraction of the ckm angles @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( see e.g. @xcite ) . while in most cases",
    "there is a dominance of quasi two - body final states , in some decay channels the contributions from non - resonant three - particle states seems to be rather large  @xcite .",
    "the study of the interference pattern of the resonances in dalitz plots is a well established method to determine cp asymmetries  @xcite , while further information can be inferred on strong resonances , such as masses , widths and quantum numbers  @xcite .",
    "there are , however , two obvious problems in the quasi - two - body interpretation of resonant effects in multi - body decays , one practical and one conceptual . from the practical point of view , any parametrization of resonant structures is model dependent , as no universal line - shape for strong resonances is accurate , especially for broad states . on the conceptual level ,",
    "the mere separation of resonant and non - resonant contributions is not clear - cut , most prominently in the case of non - leptonic decays where non - factorizable effects exist .    in the case of two - body non - leptonic @xmath0",
    "decays , the heavy - quark limit has been exploited systematically in the context of qcd factorization @xcite or soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite , where the matrix elements factorize into a convolution of perturbative hard kernels , form factors and meson distribution amplitudes on the light cone .",
    "corrections to factorization arise at subleading orders in the heavy - quark / large - energy expansion , and remain a source of uncertainty which is difficult to estimate .",
    "some potentially important non - factorizable effects might be related to nearly on - shell intermediate states , such as charm - loops or rescattering effects from light mesons .",
    "phenomenological investigations of such effects have limited potential , mainly because the kinematics of two - body decays is fixed . on the other hand ,",
    "three - body decays have at their disposal a wide phase space where the energy dependence of such effects can be studied , with the potential of providing a deeper understanding of factorization and hadronic effects in @xmath0 decays .",
    "it is fair to say that the theoretical description of three - body @xmath0 decays is still in the stage of modeling .",
    "common methods reflecting the state of the art are the isobar model  @xcite and the k - matrix formalism  @xcite . in these approaches ,",
    "resonances are modeled and the non - resonant contributions are often described by an empirical distribution in order to reproduce the full range of the phase space @xcite . in the context of factorization , in refs .",
    "@xcite the matrix elements were factorized naively and the resulting local correlators were computed in the framework of heavy - meson chiral perturbation theory ( hmchpt ) , but no attempt was made to address the breakdown of factorization or hmchpt in the respective regions of phase space where they are not expected to apply .",
    "other recent work relying on pqcd  @xcite , seems to reproduce experimental values for cp asymmetries integrated in certain regions of phase space  @xcite .",
    "however , if the conceptual issues regarding the pqcd approach  @xcite can not be resolved , its predictive power remains limited . in the future ,",
    "novel model - independent approaches that directly access cp violation ( such as the miranda procedure  @xcite ) or methods based on flavor symmetries  @xcite could become interesting ; however , for a quantitative description of the differential dalitz distributions including amplitude phase information , a qcd - based approach is unavoidable .    in the present letter",
    "we take a step in this direction , and study the factorization properties of charmless three - body and the corresponding quasi - two body @xmath0 decays . for that purpose ,",
    "we focus specifically on the decay @xmath11 , assuming that the @xmath2-quark mass is large enough .",
    "we start by identifying the different regions in the dalitz plot where the well - established factorization properties of two - body decays apply to the three - body case . in the heavy - mass limit",
    ", we discuss how to compute the central region of the dalitz plot as well as its edges .",
    "we will see that the methods and the theoretical inputs are different in the different regions : while the center can be described in terms of regular from factors and pion distributions , the description at the edges requires introducing generalized versions of these hadronic matrix elements .",
    "generalized form factors and distribution amplitudes have been already studied , the former in the context of semileptonic @xmath0 decays @xcite , and the latter in connection with two - meson electro - production @xcite or semileptonic @xmath12 decays @xcite ( see e.g. @xcite ) . as an application , we consider the @xmath13 branching ratio by integrating the differential rate around the @xmath14 resonance .",

    "we neglect pion masses in the kinematics , such that : @xmath16 the kinematics of the three - body decay is completely determined by two of the three kinematic invariants @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , which ( in the massless limit ) satisfy @xmath20 and @xmath21 . the physical kinematical region in the plane of two invariants ( the dalitz plot ) is given in this case by a triangle ( see fig .",

    "there is therefore a one - to - one diagrammatic correspondence between qcdf@xmath142 and qcdf@xmath143 , but this correspondence does not respect the power counting .    .diagrammatic correspondence between the different contributions in qcdf@xmath142 and qcdf@xmath143 .",

    "the last four contributions are leading at the center but power - suppressed at the edge .",
    "see the text for details . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we note at this point that in the center , since all invariant masses are large and of order @xmath159 , there are always two hard propagators , leading to an amplitude that is power suppressed with respect to the amplitude at the edge . in addition , the perturbative nature of the hard gluon exchange leads to an @xmath160 suppression at the center , which is not present at the edge , where the gluon becomes soft .",
    "all in all , the amplitude at the center is expected to be both power- and @xmath6-suppressed with respect to the amplitude at the edge .",
    "while the previous considerations imply that formally there must be a good matching between both regions , the question is whether this happens in practice for realistic @xmath0-meson masses . to this end",
    "we focus on the @xmath86lcd contribution shown in the first row in table  [ tab : correspondence ] .",
    "this contribution arises from the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : aedge ] ) .",
    "we find that , in the limit of large @xmath161 , this amplitude reproduces the corresponding contribution obtained from the qcdf@xmath142 calculation in section  [ sec : ms ] . to satisfy the perturbative limit asymptotically for large @xmath162 .",
    "this is in fact the only information we have on @xmath88 at large energies , since data reaches only up to @xmath163 gev . for our purposes ,",
    "the relevant observation is that data shows that the perturbative regime might lie beyond 3 gev . ]",

    "[ fig : merge ] we show the results of both calculations for different values of @xmath24 .",
    "we see that for @xmath164 gev there is enough phase space to reach a perturbative regime in the central region of the dalitz plot .",

    "adding the rest of the central - region contributions to the perturbative side , we will get a mismatch at large @xmath161 of the order of the perturbative contribution itself , which is expected to be of the same order as neglected power corrections to the qcdf@xmath143 calculation in the perturbative limit .",
    "this corresponds to the contributions in the last four columns in table  [ tab : correspondence ] . since we anyway do not expect the two - pion system to factorize into single - pion distributions as early as @xmath167  gev@xmath114",
    ", we can conclude that the qcdf@xmath142 calculation of section  [ sec : ms ] might not be relevant in any region of the dalitz plot .",
    "three - body @xmath0 decays provide many opportunities for studies of flavor physics and cp violation , as well for studies of factorization issues in qcd .",
    "while a large amount of experimental information is already available , an even larger amount is expected from future studies at the lhc , as well as from belle - ii .",
    "these promising experimental prospects are not yet backed - up by theoretical studies able to describe these decays differentially in the kinematics , and in a model - independent manner . in this paper",
    "we have performed a first study in the context of qcd factorization .",
    "the dalitz plot for three - body @xmath0 decays can be divided in several regions with special kinematics and with different factorization properties . in the heavy - quark limit",
    ", the amplitude in the central region of the dalitz plot factorizes into regular @xmath57 form factors and pion light - cone distribution amplitudes . on the other hand , near the edge",
    "two pions become collinear and the amplitude resembles a two - body decay , with the difference that a new type of non - perturbative functions must be introduced : @xmath93 form factors and @xmath86lcds . the fact that these objects can not be factorized",
    "further is signaled by the divergence of the factorized expressions at the center when one invariant mass is taken to zero .",
    "we have calculated the amplitudes in both regions at the leading order , and verified these factorization properties .",
    "assuming that these two regions are well described by the respective calculations , it is interesting to determine how well these two descriptions merge at intermediate kinematical regimes .",
    "we have seen that some of the contributions at the center correspond , in the heavy quark limit , to the expression for the amplitude at the edge with factorized @xmath45 form factors and @xmath86lcds .",
    "therefore , a parametrization of these nonperturbative objects that is consistent with their perturbative limit leads automatically to a well behaved limit of the result at the edge when extrapolated to the center .",
    "however , it seems that the perturbative regime is only kinematically allowed for @xmath2-quark masses several times larger than the real value . in addition , the rest of the qcd factorization contributions at the center correspond to power - suppressed corrections at the edge .    at this point",
    ", a more refined study of the dalitz plot distribution based on a factorization in terms of two - pion distributions and @xmath45 form factors seems worthwhile .",
    "next - to - leading ( nlo ) corrections to the hard kernels are already known from two - body decays , and can be used directly in the factorization formula of eq .",
    "( [ s23small ] ) to verify factorization at nlo . on the phenomenological level , this requires a better knowledge of two - pion distributions .",
    "first , one must go beyond the local limit ( where information other than @xmath88 is needed ) .",
    "second , the tensor distribution @xmath78 is expected to contribute , while little is known about it .",
    "besides the traditional studies of two - pion distributions from @xmath168 and @xmath169 , we propose to study such distributions in the context of non - leptonic decays such as @xmath170 where factorization is considerably simpler than for @xmath92 .",
    "regarding @xmath45 form factors , better knowledge is also required .",
    "improved light - cone sum - rule calculations @xcite , as well as precise experimental studies of the semileptonic decays @xmath171 @xcite and @xmath172 will be essential .",
    "besides @xmath99 decays , other three - body decays with kaons ( @xmath173 , etc . )",
    "have been studied experimentally at @xmath0-factories and the lhc ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "their branching fractions are higher because they are not ckm suppressed , with the corresponding impact in terms of statistics .",
    "these channels can be studied in a similar fashion .",
    "this requires knowledge on @xmath174 and @xmath175 form factors , as well as @xmath176 and @xmath177 distributions .",

    "<S> the edges of the dalitz plot , on the other hand , require different non - perturbative input : the @xmath5 form factor and the two - pion distribution amplitude . </S>",

    "<S> we argue that for realistic @xmath0-meson masses there is no perturbative center in the dalitz plot , but that a systematic description might be possible in the context of two - pion states . as an example , we estimate the @xmath8 branching fraction beyond the quasi - particle approximation . we also discuss the prospects for studies of three - body and quasi - two - body non - leptonic @xmath0 decays from qcd .    </S>",
