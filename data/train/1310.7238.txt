    "the universe is not static : optical , infrared , radio , x - ray and @xmath2-ray observations reveal a rich diversity in variability and explosions . in the x - ray band",
    "the observed variability on time scales of hours to days has been attributed to exploding massive stars ( @xcite ) , or the accretion of material onto neutron stars , stellar - mass ( @xcite ) or super - massive black holes such as in active galactic nuclei ( agn ; ) .",
    "the disruption of a star by a super - massive black hole has also been observed ( @xcite ) .",
    "while stellar black holes up to @xmath5 ( for example in m33 x-7 ; @xcite ) and supermassive black holes in agn with masses of @xmath6 ( @xcite ) have been identified , black holes with masses of several hundred to a few thousand solar masses remain elusive .",
    "ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) could harbor such black holes with masses in  between the stellar  mass black holes found in x  ray binaries and the super  massive black holes ( smbhs ; @xmath7 m@xmath8 ) found in the centers of galaxies .",
    "the ulx near eso  243 - 49 is possibly the best intermediate - mass black hole ( imbh ) candidate ( @xcite ) .",
    "theoretically , the mass of a stellar  mass black hole , formed from the evolution of a massive star , depends on the initial mass of the progenitor , on the supernova explosion mechanism ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and on how much mass is lost during the progenitor s evolution which , in turn , is a function of the metallicity of the black hole progenitor star .",
    "mass is lost through stellar winds , the mass  loss rate strongly depends on the metallicity of the star . for a low  metallicity star ( @xmath9 solar metallicity ) it is possible to leave a black hole of @xmath10 ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , theories do allow for more massive stellar  mass black holes than have been found so far in our galaxy ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    in very massive stars ( @xmath11 )",
    "production of free electrons and positrons , due to increased @xmath2-ray production , reduce thermal pressure inside the core .",
    "this eventually leads to a runaway thermonuclear explosion that completely disrupts the star without leaving a black hole , causing the upper limit for a stellar black hole of @xmath12 .",
    "it has been suggested that metal  free population iii stars could have had masses above this pair  instability limit and collapsed into intermediate  mass black holes ( @xcite ) .",
    "it has also been suggested that imbhs may form in the centers of dense stellar clusters via the merger of stellar mass black holes ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or from the collapse of merged supermassive stars in very dense star clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these massive black holes could allow for the assembly of supermassive black holes early in the universe ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "stellar dynamical models predict that once every @xmath13@xmath14 year a star in a galaxy will pass within the tidal disruption radius of the central black hole and thus will be torn apart by tidal forces ( @xcite ) .",
    "the fall - back of debris onto the black hole produces a luminous electromagnetic flare that is detectable in uv and x - ray light .",
    "several uv transients coincident with the center of a galaxy have been detected ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "candidates detected so far in x - rays using rosat , , and had black body temperatures with kt = 0.04 - 0.12 kev (;",
    "@xcite ; ) .",
    "tidal disruption events have a rise time of hours to weeks .",
    "the timescale for the light curve to peak depends on the black hole mass , with lower mass black holes having shorter rise times and on the compactness of the disrupted star , with more compact stars , like white dwarfs , allowing for a shorter rise time .",
    "recently , a new manifestation of tidal disruption events was reported .",
    "the new extreme source discovered by ( swift j164449.3 + 573451 ) is caused by relativistic jet emission launched due to a tidal disruption event ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the source had an extreme x - ray luminosity ( @xmath15 ) that lasted for months .",
    "a power - law like spectrum was detected in x - rays . during a possibly super - eddington early phase in a tidal disruption event",
    ", the source can produce brief flares , of duration of order thousand seconds . whereas most tidal disruption events are associated with the center of a galaxy , in principle one could find them also outside the core of a galaxy ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we here present the discovery of a new transient x - ray source .",
    "the properties of this transient event seem to be most compatible with those predicted for the tidal disruption of a compact ( white dwarf ) star by an imbh .",
    "we identified a new type of x - ray transient in a _",
    "chandra _ observation that started on 2000 may 19 ut ( universal time ) .",
    "we designate the name x - ray transient ( xrt )  000519 to this event .",
    "the transient was discovered in _",
    "chandra _ images with observation identification number 803 .",
    "the source position was covered by the s4 ccd of the acis - s array of ccd detectors ( @xcite ) .",
    "we reprocessed and analyzed the data using the ciao 4.5 software developed by the x  ray center and employing caldb version 4.5.5.1 .",
    "the data telemetry mode was set to _ very faint _ , which allows for a thorough rejection of events caused by cosmic rays .",
    "the acis - s4 ccd is known to be suffering from an error in the readout where charge unrelated to the arrival of x - ray photons is deposited during read - out of the ccd .",
    "these events can be removed in the subsequent processing of the event file by using the destreak command in the ciao software suite provided by the _ chandra _ x - ray center ( @xcite ) . is still detected at a very high significance level after we run the destreak command .",
    "however , given that this tool also removes some charge from genuine x - ray photons when the x - ray source is very bright , we extracted the data from the peak of without applying the destreak step .",
    "using the wavdetect tool on the x - ray image allows us to locate the event at ( j2000 ) right ascension 12@xmath1625@xmath1731.64@xmath18 and declination + 13@xmath1903@xmath2058.8@xmath21 with an estimated 68 per cent confidence uncertainty in the position of 1@xmath21 due to the large angle of 13.37@xmath22 between the optical axis of the _ chandra _ mirrors and the location of the source on the detector .",
    "we investigated the point - spread function of the source by performing a marx simulation for such an off - axis angle and we find that the observed point - spread function is consistent with that expected on the basis of the simulation . due to the large off - axis angle the source photons were spread over hundreds of detector elements , making spectral distortion due to photon pile - up minimal .",
    "the light curve of the main event , plotted at the maximum time resolution of 3.24  s , is double peaked ( see figure  [ lc ] ) .",
    "the source flux rises within 10  s from being undetected to a peak count rate of 20 counts s@xmath23 , it decays more slowly over a period of 20  s to a count rate just above 1 count s@xmath23 , to rise again to the peak count rate of 24 counts s@xmath23 .",
    "the second peak has a flat top that lasts around 20  s , before gradually decreasing on a time scale of about 100  s , followed by a slow power law decay with an index of -0.3@xmath240.1 that could be followed for 2@xmath25  s until the end of the observation .",
    "when investigating the x - ray light curve of the source we found evidence for the presence of a precursor event of 16 x - ray photons about 4,000  s before the main flare . in the same 1,000  s interval of time of the precursor , we find 4 photons due to the background in a source - free region with the same size as the source region , on the same ccd and at a similar off - axis angle as xrt  000519 .",
    "thus , the chance of finding 16 photons due to random variations in the background is less than 1 in 250,000 .",
    "interestingly , there is evidence for another precursor event , again about 4,000  s earlier . in that case",
    ", we find 11 photons in 1,000  s where 3.7 are found in an off - source region over the same time ; this should happen by chance in less than 1 in 650,000 cases .",
    "therefore , we conclude that these two precursor events are likely to be real .",
    "the small number of events ( three ) does not allow us to conclude that the 4,000  s time scale is periodic .",
    "we extracted the source spectrum from photons in a circular region with radius of 30 centered on the source position of in the energy range of 0.17 kev .",
    "background events were extracted from an annulus centered on the position of the source with an inner radius of 60 and an outer radius of 105 . using _",
    "version 12.4.0ad ( @xcite ) we have fitted the spectra of  using cash statistics ( @xcite ) modified to account for the subtraction of background counts , the so called w  statistics .",
    "we have used an absorbed power  law model ( _ pegpwrlw _ in _ xspec _ ) to describe the data . for the extraction of the x - ray spectral parameters we added an extinction of @xmath26 @xmath27 due to the galactic foreground ( ) .",
    "we did not detect enough counts to add a component to the fit function that could describe the influence of the potential presence of local material causing extinction in addition to that by the galactic foreground .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of the first of the two bright peaks can be well described by a powerlaw with photon index 1.6@xmath240.1 ( 68%  confidence level ) where we included the effect of the galactic extinction in the direction of the source .",
    "the energy spectrum of the second of the two bright peaks is softer with a power law photon index of 1.95@xmath240.05 ( see figure  [ xspec ] ) .",
    "the fact that the second peak has a higher peak count rate while it has a softer spectrum is in line with the inference that the x - ray spectrum is not distorted by the effects of photon pile - up .",
    "we further investigated the energy associated with each of the x - ray photons making up the precursor events .",
    "we find that most of their photons have an energy near 12 kev which renders support for their interpretation as genuine source photons rather than background photons , as the spectrum agrees well with that found for the main event .",
    "xrt  000519 was not detected by the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) , although the source was in the batse field of view at the time of the event ( including the precursor events ) .",
    "extrapolating the best - fitting x - ray spectrum at peak would have the source falling a factor of @xmath150 below the batse threshold for detection . the nearly steady emission during the second half of the observation falls a factor of a few below the occultation technique s sensitivity limit .",
    "xmm-_newton _ x - ray observations of the region on the sky containing the position of xrt  000519 were obtained on 2002 july 1 , 2004 december 27 and 2011 june 1 ( the observation identification numbers for these observations are 0108260201 , 0210270201 , and 0673310101 , respectively ) . using the 2012 june 21 release of sas",
    ", we cleaned the event lists for periods of enhanced background leaving 78 and 79 ksec for the mos1 and mos2 detectors in the 2002 observation , respectively .",
    "the source region falls off the pn ccd during the 2002 observation .",
    "the 2004 observation yielded 18 ksec of cleaned pn exposure and 21.7 ksec for both mos1 and mos2 . finally , the 2011 observation has 40 ksec of cleaned pn exposure .",
    "the source went undetected with a ( 0.5 - 10 kev ) flux limit of @xmath28 for an assumed incident power law spectrum with index 1.7 for the first two observations and @xmath29 for the last observation , giving a luminosity upper limit of 1@xmath30 for the first two and 9@xmath31  for the third observation , respectively if the event took place at the distance of m  86 of 16.2 mpc .",
    "we queried various data archives to search for archival ultra - violet , optical and near - infrared images of the field of xrt  000519 .",
    "the galaxy evolution explorer satellite ( galex ) observed the field of the transient on 2006 march 20 for 15700  s with its near - ultraviolet camera and for 482  s with its far - ultraviolet camara .",
    "no source was detected in either the near - ultraviolet or the far - ultra - violet image down to a magnitude limit of 25.5 and 23.7 , respectively .",
    "we investigated a 999  s @xmath32-band image ( @xmath33  , @xmath34  ) from the isaac newton telescope ( int ) at la palma , spain , obtained on 2001 march 22 ( see figure  2 ) .",
    "we found a faint optical star at a magnitude of @xmath35 magnitude .",

    "we used a gaussian smoothing with a kernel radius of 2 pixels to highlight the faint source .",
    "the larger number of sources towards the north - east of the image is due to the presence of a stream of stars protruding from m  86 ( see section 3).,width=302 ]    we found archival optical images in the @xmath37 and @xmath38-band obtained in 2009 and 2010 by the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) using the megaprime instrument ( see table 1 ) .",

    "this source position is 1.2 arcsec away from the position of and thus falls just outside the estimated error circle .",
    "the non - detection of the int @xmath32-band source in the deep cfht @xmath32-band image obtained a few years later in time ( 2009 may 14 - 15 ) down to a magnitude limit of 25.6 magnitudes , indicates that the source magnitude decayed by at least 1.2 magnitudes , strengthening the association of the int optical i@xmath22-band source with .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we found a new transient x - ray source in an archival observation .",
    "the source position is 12.16 arcminutes from the centre of m  86 , and it does not fall in the m  86 @xmath47 magnitude per arcsec@xmath48 isophote area ( @xcite ) that has an approximate radius of 8.5 arcminutes in the direction of the   location .",
    "however , it was found that m  86 is falling into the virgo cluster and that gas is stripped off the galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "the projected stripped gas lies close to the position of .",
    "furthermore , the deep optical int images we investigated show that stars , possibly stripped off the galaxy sdss  j122541.29 + 130251.2 , follow the stripped gas , which suggests that m  86 shows signs of a recent minor merger ( see figure  [ stream ] ) .",
    "the small projected distance on the sky between the position of   and that of the stream of stripped stars strengthens the association between and m  86 .",
    "the stream of stars falls between the wedge - shaped hot gas structure visible in the x - ray images of the field ( @xcite ) , suggesting that some or all of the gas may come from the infalling galaxy , making this a wet minor merger .",
    "whereas the source location is in the direction of the early type galaxy m  86 , the source could in principle be a foreground object located in our own galaxy , it could indeed be located at the distance of 16.2 mpc of m  86 , or it could be located further away , well behind m  86 .",
    "as the close proximity on the sky makes a scenario where the distance is consistent with that of m  86 appealing , we discuss here a scenario for that is borne out by the observations , where the source is associated with m  86 . below we discuss other scenarios with the source placed at the distance of m  86 or at other distances .",
    "if the transient event took place at the distance of m  86 the peak luminosity would be @xmath0 .",
    "the late time , slowly decaying , ( 0.5 - 10 kev ) flux level is 4@xmath49 , which for the distance of m  86 would be @xmath50 .",
    "if we interpret the peak flux as the eddington luminosity we derive a mass estimate of 4.6@xmath25 m@xmath4 .",
    "the time scale and luminosity of the event , and the occurence in an old population , limit the potential interpretations .",
    "we only know a few classes of events that can release so much energy over a short timescale .",
    "we favor the scenario where xrt  000519 is due to a tidal disruption event ( tde ) of a star by an intermediate - mass black hole near m  86 .",
    "the ( quasi- ) periodic recurrence time of the precursors of @xmath514,000  s is potentially related to the orbital period of the stellar material present around the black hole after the tidal disruption , with subsequent passages of a partially disrupted star ( @xcite ) or with variations in the fall - back rate after the white dwarft has been disrupted .",
    "the latter is likely to occur as the white dwarf will be disrupted in a strong gravitational field regime where the orbits of the fluid elements are not closed giving rise to the possibility of multiple shocks , however , the current models are not yet calculated taking this into account ( see the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "this short recurrence time of @xmath514,000  s and the inference that the peak flux is at or close to the eddington luminosity , would imply a @xmath52 m@xmath4 black hole tidally disrupting a white dwarf ( see e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in the two observed passages prior to the main event , some of the material of the white dwarf star is accreted by the black hole giving off x - rays with a peak luminosity of @xmath53 . in a subsequent orbit",
    "the self - interaction of the accreting material increases the viscosity giving rise to the bright peaks , in line with modelling ( ) .",
    "it is unlikely that the white dwarf detonates : a detonating white dwarf would appear as a bright type ia supernova and the absolute @xmath32-band magnitude during the int observation is too low to be consistent with a type ia supernova less than one year after the explosion ( ) . the observed tail in the observation would be associated with the accretion of part of the material falling back ( at super - eddington rates ) towards the intermediate - mass black hole ( @xcite ) .",
    "the luminosity may well be limited to be below the eddington limit .",
    "to explain the two - peak structure of the main event of detailed hydrodynamical calculations have to be performed , which is beyond the scope of this paper .    in order for a star to be tidally disrupted by a black hole , it has to wander close enough .",
    "the rates for this to happen are low , except for instance in regions of high stellar density such as the centers of galaxies or in globular clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "the photometry we have is consistent with a scenario where originated in a globular cluster , although the globular cluster would have to be at the faint end of the globular cluster luminosity function ( @xcite , 2010 edition ) .",
    "below , we discuss alternative scenarios for .",
    "the time scale and luminosity of , and the occurence in an old population , if located at the distance of m  86 , suggests that xrt  000519 could for instance be due to two compact objects merging , such as a neutron star - neutron star merger .",
    "given that we detect no hard x - ray or @xmath2-ray emission , we would be observing the merger off - axis , unlike the short - hard @xmath2-ray bursts ( @xcite ) .",
    "accretion from fall - back material onto the newly formed black hole would in this scenario account for the late time x - ray emission .",
    "the non - detection of the source in the radio down to 0.18 mjy on 2012 may  1@xmath542 ( karl g.  jansky very large array , central frequency 1636 mhz ) , thus nearly 12 years after the event , only loosely constrains the circum - stellar binary density in this scenario ( for predictions for radio emission of off - axis @xmath2-ray bursts see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "however , the precursor events are hard to explain in this scenario , making it less likely . an alternative , related , scenario involves a neutron star overflowing its roche lobe onto a black hole or another neutron star .",
    "the neutron star mass donor will eventually drop below the minimum mass for a neutron star . at that point ,",
    "the star should explode , and some of the debris should be captured by the other compact object ( @xcite ) .",
    "the optical source could in this scenario be interpreted as the late time fading counterpart at m@xmath55 for a distance modulus of 31 for m  86 ( which converts to an @xmath32-band luminosity of 8@xmath56 ) . however , again the precursor events require a special explanation in this scenario .",
    "if the source is in m  86 it could in principle be that we witnessed a type ia supernova shock break - out ( @xcite ) .",
    "a problem with this scenario is that the optical supernova was not discovered , which is unlikely given that the virgo and m  86 region of the sky are well monitored ( @xcite ) and given that type ia sne have an absolute magnitude of -19 in the @xmath57-band ( ) which means that the optical supernova would have reached @xmath5812 , which is easily accessible also for amateur astronomers .",
    "the detection of the faint @xmath32-band at m@xmath59 also makes this scenario improbable as typical type ia supernovae do not decay that fast in the @xmath32-band within a year ( ) .",
    "one could also envisage a scenario where the source is nearby , e.g.  in our own galaxy .",
    "for instance , the brightening in x - rays and the @xmath32-band could be due to an accretion event onto an isolated , old , neutron star .",
    "the isolated neutron star is then possibly detected in the late - time cfht @xmath44-band observation .",
    "the two detections are offset by 1.1 arcseconds in right ascension and by -1.2 arcseconds in declination giving a distance on the sky between the two positions of 1.6 arcseconds .",
    "this would yield a proper motion of 0.16 arcseconds per year with respect to the @xmath32-band variable source detected in 2001 . for a typical transverse velocity of an isolated neutron star of 200 km s@xmath23",
    ", we derive a distance of 250 pc for the source . at that distance the fluence of the event would imply the accretion of around @xmath60  g onto the neutron star .",
    "the deep upper limits on the quiescent x - ray emission derived from the xmm-_newton _ observations imply a limit on the luminosity of 3@xmath61   for such a distance .",
    "this means that the quiescent neutron star luminosity is lower than what has been observed so far for isolated neutron stars ( @xcite ) , however , the current observations favor young , hot neutron stars . additionally ,",
    "the cooler the neutron star , the more its emission peaks towards the soft x - rays or even the ultra - violet part of the energy spectrum . additional , new , optical ( e.g.  hubble space telescope ) observations could test this scenario by checking whether the faint @xmath44-band source indeed has a proper motion of 0.16 arcseconds per year .    in an alternative version of this scenario , where we do not ascribe the @xmath44-band detection to the isolated neutron star , and",
    "thus we have no constraint on the proper motion or distance of the neutron star , we can place it at a larger distance .",
    "this would increase the total energy liberated in the transient event and thus the amount of accreted mass but it alleviates the constraint on the quiescent x - ray luminosity of the isolated neutron star .",
    "however , in both these isolated neutron star scenarios the precursor events and their 4,000  s time scale are difficult to understand .",
    "furthermore , the accretion of asteroid - sized bodies onto a neutron star are thought to produce significant amounts of @xmath2-ray emission ( @xcite ) , which is not detected from , implying that for reasons unknown , the @xmath2-ray emission is much reduced in this case , making this scenario less likely .",
    "if we instead interpret as coming from a redshift , z , between 0.231.5 in line with the @xmath44-band non - detection of an unresolved faint dwarf galaxy of an absolute magnitude of @xmath62 ( @xcite ) , then the luminosity of xrt  000519 would be between 3@xmath63  3@xmath64 .",
    "then , it could potentially be interpreted as an x - ray flash such as those found in x - rays and which are probably related to @xmath2-ray bursts ( @xcite ) . however , with a peak energy , @xmath65 of about 1.5 kev , the event has a softer x - ray spectrum than that of x - ray flashes known so far ( @xcite ) . nevertheless , if the event was indeed near z=1.5 , thus at a luminosity of l@xmath66 , then the peak energy @xmath65 of 1.5 kev and the isotropic peak energy at the peak flux , @xmath67 , are consistent with those expected extrapolating the @xmath65 and @xmath67 correlation of x - ray flashes and @xmath2-ray bursts to lower values ( the @xcite relation ) .",
    "whereas we can not rule out that xrt  000519 was due to an event similar to an x - ray flash , extending the peak energies and the isotropic luminosities for those events a factor of several below those that have been found for this class of flashes until now ( @xcite ) , the presence of the precursor events is never seen in x - ray flashes so far , making the association unlikely .",
    "although , the latter could be due to the reduced sensitivity of the satellites that detected the x - ray flashes so far , compared with the sensitivity .",
    "a potential problem with this scenario and a distance of z=1.5 is that even at 10 months after the event the absolute @xmath32-band magnitude @xmath68 would still have to be -20.9 magnitudes .",
    "furthermore , the projected co - location on the sky of an ongoing minor merger event and the x - ray transient would be a chance alignment in this scenario .",
    "interestingly , shcherbakov et al .  ( @xcite ) describe the x - ray flash reported by campana et al .",
    "( 2006 ) as a tde of a white dwarf by an intermediate - mass black hole .",
    "this shows that the properties of these two classes of objects , x - ray flashes associated with stellar - mass black hole formation and x - ray flashes associated with tdes by massive or intermediate - mass black holes , overlap .",
    "the main reason for this is that tdes cover x - ray luminosities ranging from as low as @xmath50 ( ) up to @xmath69 for the blazar - like tde swift  j1644 + 57 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observed peak luminosity of xrt  000519 is in the range of distances we consider here .",
    "thus , the properties of xrt  000519 are also consistent with a tde in a dwarf galaxy at a distance between approximately 1.1 and 11 gpc provided the emission is strongly beamed towards us such as in swift  j1644 + 57 ( @xcite ) , although again the optical @xmath32-band magnitude would favor distances closer to 1.1 gpc over one close to 11 gpc .",
    "we discovered a peculiar transient ( ) in the direction of m  86 .",
    "furthermore , we found evidence for an ongoing wet minor merger between m  86 and the galaxy sdss  j122541.29 + 130251.2 .",
    "this activity makes it conceivable that the transient is located at the distance of m  86 .",
    "if so , its properties are consistent with a scenarion where the transient is due to the tidal disruption of a white dwarf by an intermediate - mass black hole .",

    "<S> we present the discovery of a new type of explosive x - ray flash in images of the old elliptical galaxy m  86 . </S>",
    "<S> this unique event is characterised by the peak luminosity of @xmath0 for the distance of m  86 , the presence of precursor events , the timescale between the precursors and the main event ( @xmath14,000  s ) , the absence of detectable hard x - ray and @xmath2-ray emission , the total duration of the event and the detection of a faint associated optical signal . </S>",
    "<S> the transient is located close to m  86 in the virgo cluster at the location where gas and stars are seen protruding from the galaxy probably due to an ongoing wet minor merger . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the possible mechanisms for the transient and we conclude that the x - ray flash could have been caused by the disruption of a compact white dwarf star by a @xmath3 m@xmath4 black hole . </S>",
    "<S> alternative scenarios such that of a foreground neutron star accreting an asteroid or the detection of an off - axis ( short ) @xmath2ray burst can not be excluded at present . </S>"
