    "one of the most astronomically profitable aspects to study radially pulsating variable stars is that some groups of them have their individual period - luminosity relations that can be used as cosmic distance scales .",
    "mira - like variables are one of such group of variable stars that evolved from low- to intermediate mass ( @xmath0 ) stars , and they are in the late stage of stellar evolution ( e.g. , @xcite ) . since the discovery of the period - magnitude relation of mira - like variables ( @xcite ) , many astronomers observed them to refine the relation and to study its metallicity dependency . from late 90 s to early 00 s , there was a major progress on the study of the period - luminosity relations of variable stars due to the advent of the optical large survey projects looking for the gravitational lensing events with robotic telescopes ( e.g. , macho , ogle , eros , moa ) .",
    "the discovery of parallel sequences of period - magnitude relations of red giant variables in the large magellanic cloud ( @xcite ) is an especially important result , because it told us that each group of variables has different period - luminosity relations , and also , different relation is assigned to different pulsation mode within a group ( see also , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the near- to mid - infrared period - magnitude relations of mira - like variables in the lmc , using the combined data of recently published ogle - iii data ( @xcite ) and the _ spitzer _ sage catalog ( @xcite ) .",
    "infrared data is imperative because mira - like variables are usually associated with the circumstellar dust shell , which is formed by the mass - loss phenomenon .",
    "recently , the ogle project @xcite released its third phase ( ogle - iii ; 12th june , 2001  3rd may , 2009 ) survey data .",
    "they provided catalogs of several types of variable stars in the magellanic clouds . using their on - line database , stars with variable star type of `` mira ''",
    "were chosen by querying their catalog of long - period variables in the lmc @xcite .",
    "the query yielded a catalog of 1,663 mira - like variables in the lmc .",
    "@xcite used the @xmath1band pulsation amplitude to distinguish miras and semi - regular variables .",
    "they defined miras as having @xmath1band pulsation amplitude greater than 0.8 mag . in this paper , we follow their classification and call these mira - like variables as just miras or ogle - iii miras .",
    "the ogle - iii catalog lists not only coordinates , but also pulsation periods , amplitudes , surface chemistries ( oxygen - rich / carbon - rich ) inferred by photometric colors , time averaged @xmath2 and @xmath1band magnitudes , and other useful parameters .",
    "the ogle - iii mira catalog is cross - identified with the following existing catalogs using a positional tolerance of 3 arcsec .",
    "if more than one stars are present within the tolerance radius , the closest one is adopted and discard the others .",
    "the result is used for discussion in the rest of this paper .    * the large magellanic cloud photometric survey catalog @xcite : the catalog lists @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 stellar photometry of the central 64 deg@xmath7 area of the lmc .",
    "it must be noted that we preferentially used the time - averaged @xmath2 and @xmath1band data in the ogle - iii survey catalog whenever available .",

    "the 2mass magnitudes are used for the bright sources without irsf measurements ( the irsf survey did not detect bright sources due to the saturation limit of about 10 mag at @xmath10 band . see below ) .",
    "1,639 out of a total of 1,663 miras have counterparts in this catalog .",

    "the irsf catalog is more than two magnitudes deeper at @xmath10 band and about four times finer in spatial resolution .",
    "the irsf system magnitudes were converted into the 2mass system ones by using the conversion equations given in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "fluxes in any other longer wavelengths ( i.e. , photometry in the spitzer wavebands ) are not corrected for the interstellar extinction , which we assume negligible .",
    "we also ignore the reddening inside the lmc .",
    "we calculate the bolometric luminosity of all ogle - iii miras by using a cubic spline to interpolate the spectral energy distribution and integrate it from the shortest available wavelength to 8 or 24 @xmath16 m . we used zero - magnitude fluxes tabulated in table  [ table : zeromag ] to convert magnitude into jansky .",
    "color - correction is not applied to the flux density , due to the lack of information of the incident spectrum .",
    "for some of the very red sources , the calculated luminosities can be underestimated to a large extent because the fluxes longward of 24 @xmath16 m are not included . therefore the calculated luminosities should be only lower limits for the very red sources . also , we have to note that the calculated luminosities are rather uncertain , because they are sensitive to changes of degree of interstellar reddening , color correction , and also to time variation of light , which is significant especially for mira - like variables discussed here .",

    "the blue crosses indicates o - rich red supergiants identified by @xcite . by comparing these two figures , one can understand where each of the three groups is located in the period - magnitude plane .",
    "there are several interesting features in figures  [ pl ] and [ pl2 ] .",
    "it seems that miras with shorter primary pulsation periods fall on a relatively tight pmr regardless of their surface chemistry .",
    "we conducted a two - tailed student s t - test to test a hypothesis that `` the o - rich and c - rich miras obey the same period - luminosity relation '' .",
    "a 95 % confidence level was chosen .",
    "specifically , the mean magnitudes and variances of o - rich and c - rich miras in the @xmath45 bins are calculated and then compared .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ t - test ] .",
    "the test suggests that miras with periods shorter than about 200 days ( @xmath46 2.3 ) obey the same pmr regardless of their surface chemistry and also of employed waveband . for the easy explanation ,",
    "we call the pmrs of these shorter period miras as standard pmrs , and use them for comparison .    .results of student s t - test to test a hypothesis that `` the o - rich and c - rich miras obey the same period - luminosity relation '' .",
    "the a and r means accept and reject the hypothesis , respectively . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      figure  [ pl2 ] and table  [ t - test ] suggest that the optical o - rich and c - rich miras fall on almost the same pmrs in optical and near - infrared wavebands , but infrared miras do not .",
    "it is well known that the pmr is best defined at @xmath47band , where the atmospheric bands do not contribute much and the fluxes correspond to the photosphere .",
    "it seems that this explanation holds for the optical miras only .",
    "the @xmath48band fluxes of the infrared miras , however , do not represent their photospheres any more because of the heavy circumstellar extinction even in the @xmath48 band .",
    "@xcite studied msx ( @xcite ) sources in the lmc , and found that infrared mira - like variables do not fall on the standard period@xmath49 magnitude relation for mira - like variables ( see , for example , sequence c in @xcite and @xcite ) , and they are fainter than the luminosity that the pmr predicts . here",
    "we assume that the reason of the reduced optical and near - infrared flux of the infrared miras is due solely to the circumstellar extinction by their surrounding dust shell .",
    "we also assume that all of the infrared miras should have fallen on the extension of the optical and near - infrared pmr of optical miras if they were without circumstellar dust . under these assumptions , the deviation from the luminosity that the pmr predicts ( i.e. , @xmath50 ) should be a measure of the strength of circumstellar extinction ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that there is no relevance between the deviation and pulsation period ( see figures  [ pl ] and [ pl2 ] ) .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the deviation is also independent of the pulsation amplitude at near - infrared bands .",
    "the interpretation of these observational facts will be made in the separate paper ( ita et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "as stated above , the amount of deviation is independent of pulsation period and amplitude .",
    "however , it would be of great interest if we can correlate the deviation with the other observables ( and especially distance - independent ones ) , because such relation would be useful , for example , to correctly estimate the distances to mira - like variables through pmr after considering the reduction in their apparent magnitude by the circumstellar extinction .",
    "figure  [ deviation ] is a plot to show that there is a strong correlation between the observed near - infrared color and the deviation .",
    "this result suggests that the near - infrared color can be a good indicator to probe the circumstellar extinction of miras . to formulate the relation between the near - infrared colors and the deviation , we calculate the mean deviation ( @xmath51 ) of miras in the @xmath52 mag bin and its corresponding standard deviation ( @xmath53 ) , where the suffix @xmath54 stands for the @xmath54-th bin and @xmath55 represents the employed color in magnitude",
    "the cyan points with error bars in figure  [ deviation ] show the calculated @xmath51 and @xmath53 .",
    "then we fit a quadratic function to the cyan points in the form of @xmath56 by using levenberg - marquardt algorithm with giving statistical weights proportional to @xmath57 .",
    "the fitting results are shown in the solid line in figure  [ deviation ] , and the calculated coefficients are summarized in table  [ devcolor ] .    the amount of deviation itself has important physical meanings .",
    "it can be used to roughly estimate the mass - loss rate by making a further assumption that the standard interstellar extinction law can be equally applied to mira s circumstellar environment .",
    "this assumption should be inappropriate especially for c - rich miras , because the interstellar environment is o - rich in the first place .",
    "also , the extinction law in the circumstellar environment looks indeed different from that in the interstellar environment , to the extent that the figure  [ deviationratio ] shows ( see next ) . at the level of order of magnitude estimate , however , we suppose the assumption is valid .",
    "the observed @xmath10 band magnitude of most of the infrared miras are more than 2 magnitude fainter than the one predicted by the period@xmath49 magnitude relation .",
    "there are some extreme infrared miras that are more than 4 magnitude fainter than the prediction . using the standard interstellar extinction law , the 2(4 ) magnitude extinction in @xmath10 band correspond to @xmath58 of about 17(34 ) mag , and the optical depth at visual wavelength of about 15.7(31.3 ) .",
    "@xcite related the total mass loss rate and the optical extinction as , @xmath59 = 1.5 \\times 10^{-9 } ( z / z_\\odot)^{-0.5 } ( l / l_\\odot)^{0.75 } a_\\textrm{v}^{0.75}$ ] .",
    "substituting typical lmc values of @xmath60 and @xmath61 , the circumstellar extinction of @xmath62 mag gives @xmath63 @xmath64 .",
    "if we take @xmath65 , instead of @xmath61 , the mass loss rate is reduced by a factor of ( 4000/8000)@xmath66 @xmath67 0.6 . at any rate ,",
    "it is likely that many of the infrared miras in the lmc are losing mass of the order of about 10@xmath68 @xmath64 , comparable to the galactic ( i.e. , presumably more metal - rich ) miras .",
    "interestingly , this rather rough estimation of mass - loss rate is consistent with @xcite , who fit model spectral energy distribution to the observed mid - infrared spectra to calculate mass - loss rates of the same stars .",
    "the ratios of deviations in any two different wavebands also give us insights on the properties ( e.g. , grain size and composition ) of the circumstellar dust . the basic idea is like the interstellar extinction law that varies with the properties of interstellar dust .",
    "figure  [ deviationratio ] is a plot to show the relation between the ratios of deviations and pulsation period of miras . for comparison purpose ,",
    "the ratio of standard interstellar extinction law ( @xcite ) is also shown by the horizontal line .",
    "it is clear that the extinction law in the interstellar and circumstellar environment is different .",
    "it is also clear that the ratio of deviations ( hence dust properties ) changes with increasing pulsation period of c - rich miras .",
    "interestingly enough , the interstellar and circumstellar extinction law differs considerably for shorter period miras , but the difference is little for longer period ones",
    ". it would be valuable to compare this observational results with the dust extinction models to quantitatively constrain the circumstellar dust properties .",
    "we derived the near- to mid - infrared period - magnitude and also period - bolometric luminosity relations of ogle - iii mira - like variables in the lmc .",
    "mass - losing mira - like variables do not fall on the derived relations , due to the circumstellar extinction .",
    "we showed that this fact can be used as an proxy to study the properties of the circumstellar dust , and also to estimate mass - loss rate .",
    "we found that the dust properties change with increasing pulsation period .",
    "a comparison between the observational facts and dust extinction model would reveal how dust grain evolves during the mira phase .",
