    "among various kinetic corrections to magnetohydrodinamics models ( mhd ) , the hall effect @xcite has been considered of particular importance in numerous studies : magnetic reconnection @xcite , dynamo mechanisms @xcite , accretion disks@xcite and physics of turbulent regimes @xcite are some of the main examples . in this paper",
    "we want to study the general effect of the hall term in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in plasmas embedded in a strong uniform magnetic field , through numerical simulations .",
    "we studied the effect of this term on the dynamics of global magnitudes , the cascade of energy , the characteristic scales and the intermittency of the flow .",
    "the mhd models ( one - fluid models ) are important frameworks for the understanding of the large scale dynamics of a plasma .",
    "however , these models fail to describe plasma phenomena with characteristic length scales smaller than the ion skin depth @xmath0 ( with @xmath1 the ion plasma frequency and @xmath2 speed of light ) . at this level , the hall effect , which takes into account the separation between electrons and ions , becomes relevant . to describe this regime is common to use the hall mhd approximation , wich considers two - fluid effects through a generalized ohm s law which includes the hall current . in presence of a strong external magnetic field",
    "a new reduced model has been proposed , the rhmhd model@xcite ) . in this approximation ,",
    "the fast compressional alfvn mode is eliminated , while the shear alfvn and the slow magnetosonic modes are retained @xcite .",
    "this new model ( rhmhd ) is an extension ( including the hall effect ) of the previously known reduced mhd ( rmhd ) model .",
    "the rmhd equations have been used to investigate a variety of problems such as current sheet formation @xcite , non - stationary reconnection @xcite , the dynamics of coronal loops @xcite , and the development of turbulence @xcite .",
    "the self - consistency of the rmhd approximation has been analyzed in ref .",
    "moreover , numerical simulations have studied the validity of the rmhd equations by directly comparing its predictions with the compressible mhd equations in a turbulent regime @xcite . in the same way it has been studied the validity of the rhmhd model @xcite .",
    "the control parameter ( the hall parameter ) in this regime is @xmath3 , the ratio of the ion skin depth @xmath4 to the characteristic ( large ) scale of the turbulence @xmath5 .",
    "the influence of the hall term can then be studied by increasing the hall parameter in different simulations .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : section [ equations ] describes the sets of equations used , and the codes to numerically integrate these equations . in section [ resultados ]",
    "we present the numerical results : first a comparison between simulations with different hall parameter is performed for some global magnitudes , second we study the energy spectra , and then we use different techniques to see the evolution of the characteristic structures of the flow . finally , in section [ conclusiones ] we list our conclusions .",

    "these effects could be due to a change in the characteristic time of the energy flow or to the development of small scale structures .",
    "to better understand these issues we study the energy spectra and the size and shape of the structures generated in the four runs .",
    "this help us to see whether or not the hall effect produces the development of small scales and also to understand this dynamic in terms of the energy distribution .    looking at the spectra we can see the distribution of the energy through different scales .",

    "[ spectros ] and [ spectros_zoom ] ) .",
    "the effect of the hall term is then twofold : first there is a slow down of the energy transfer up to the hall scale , resulting in a steeper spectrum , and then there seems to be a driving of energy from the hall scale up to the small scales ( see @xcite for a study of how the hall term affects the transfer of energy at different scales ) .",
    "a shift of the effective dissipation scale to larger scales is then to be expected ( as indicated by the values of @xmath73 given before ) as well as a decrease in the global dissipation values . at the same time , since the hall term increases the number of effective scales on which the dynamics occurs ( as evindenced by the extended spectra at small scales ) a longer time to reach the peak of dissipation is expected , as previously shown .",

    "we have highlighted one of the current sheets with a rectangle with dashed lines .",
    "this structure is localized and well defined .",
    "looking at the change of this structure with the value of hall parameter we can see two effects : first , a widening of the sheet and secondly an internal filamentation .",
    "the widening is very clear from figure [ corte_1 ] with @xmath69 to figure [ corte_2 ] with @xmath76 and the internal filamentation starts to be seen in the figure [ corte_3 ] , with @xmath77 , where also the thickness has increased . in the case with higher",
    "@xmath70 the current sheet is completely filamentated , and is hard to distinguish a clear structure at all .",
    "these results are complementary to the results observed in the spectra and global magnitudes and corroborate the idea that the hall effect results in an effective shift of the dissipation scale ( current sheet thickness getting larger ) but also an increase in the dynamical scale range ( increase of filamentation ) .    to better quantify the effect we have just observed , we plot the profile of the current density in the direction perpendicular to the current sheet seen in the figures [ corte_1]-[corte_4 ] .",
    "these profiles are shown in figure [ perfiles ] .",
    "current density profile of the current sheets studied . from top to bottom are the cases with @xmath69 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath70 .",
    "the net flow of current ( the absolute value ) is the same within the clear lines ( vertical outside lines ) , and the dark lines mark the original position of the current sheet when @xmath69.,width=389 ]    the net flow of current ( the absolute value ) is the same within the clear lines ( vertical outside lines ) . when @xmath69 the current sheet is perfectly located ( the dark lines mark the original position of the current sheet when @xmath69 ) and it is homogeneous ( in the sense that we have a single well defined peak ) . when @xmath76 the original sheet expands and two sheets or filaments appear in their place ( there are now two peaks ) . for @xmath77",
    "the width of the main sheet is greater and there is now a clear internal structure . in this case",
    "the ambiguity that arises is whether we have one or more sheets of current ( compare figure [ perfiles ] with [ corte_3 ] ) and hence the ambiguity of whether we have a wider sheet or two thin sheets .",
    "when @xmath70 there is no trace of the current sheet .    at this point we should make an important observation about the evolution of current sheets as a function of the hall parameter .",
    "as we saw there are two effects acting simultaneously , the widening of what could be considered the overall structure of the sheet and the internal filamentation that this suffers . in this way",
    "it could be interpreted that the hall effect widens the current sheets ( if we see the entire structure like the sheet ) or on the other hand the hall effect produces finer sheets ( considering that the small filaments are the sheets ) . to remove the ambiguity ( in semantics ) , we propose to speak in terms of dissipation , so if the global structure dissipates less energy as we increase the hall parameter we will say that the sheet is being widened , otherwise , if more energy is dissipated we will say that the relation between size and intensity of internal filaments allow us to identify new current sheets .",
    "our results agree with the first frame of mind : as a function of dissipation the current sheets are widening and even more when @xmath70 there is no trace of any structure that could be identified as a current sheet .",
    "we performed numerical simulations of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in strong magnetic fields , including the hall effect , and varying the hall parameter .",
    "we found that the hall term affects the scales that are situated between the hall scale and the dissipation scale , resulting in a decrease in the accumulation of energy in this scale range .",
    "the result is an effective shift of the dissipation scale but also a transfer of energy to smaller scales .",
    "when the separation between the hall scale and the dissipation scale is larger an increasingly sharp steepening of the energy spectrum occurs at this range of scales .",
    "the final outcome is the generation of smaller scales when the hall scale increases .",
    "localized structures are destroyed by this effect , suffering a gradual filamentation with the increase of the hall scale .",
    "the latter effect is manifested , for example , in the widening of the current sheets and the formation of internal structures within the sheets . at the same time",
    "a decrease of the total energy dissipated is observed .",
