    "the study of time - periodic quantum systems has attracted considerable interest in recent years .",
    "one of the primary motivating factors for this interest is the development of ultra - high intensity lasers , which can produce electric fields within atoms that rival those produced by the atomic nucleus .",
    "experiments with these ultra - intense lasers have led to the discovery of many interesting new phenomena , such as high harmonic generation @xcite .",
    "simple one - dimensional models of the interaction between intense lasers and atoms have been shown to reproduce , at least qualitatively , many of these interesting phenomena @xcite .",
    "these models are especially interesting because their classical versions display chaotic motion @xcite .",
    "in addition to providing insight into recent experiments , the study of these models can also provide insight into quantum - classical correspondence .",
    "one of the more interesting phenomena observed in these systems is the stabilization of atoms in intense laser fields .",
    "stabilization is characterized by a _ decrease _ in the probability for an electron to ionize as the laser intensity is _",
    "increased_. this effect was first discovered in theoretical studies of the interaction between high - frequency lasers and atoms @xcite , but recent experiments have verified that stabilization occurs in real atoms @xcite .",
    "studies of the underlying classical dynamics of these systems using one- and two - dimensional models have shown that the classical motion can often account for the increased stability of the atom at higher laser intensities @xcite .",
    "the study of time - periodic quantum models is usually carried out within the context of floquet theory @xcite .",
    "floquet eigenstates are eigenstates of the one - period time evolution operator and are the natural states for describing time - periodic systems . in some cases",
    "the floquet states of the system can be localized on stable structures in the classical phase space @xcite , and this can lead to stabilization because these floquet states have very long lifetimes . in this case , stabilization would also be predicted by the classical dynamics . however , there are often significant differences between the classical and quantum dynamics of chaotic systems .",
    "one of the most striking examples of this is scarring , where quantum eigenstates have higher probability to be found near the locations of unstable periodic orbits in the classical phase space @xcite .",
    "the scarring of floquet states on unstable periodic orbits might make it possible for a quantum system to exhibit stabilization even when the corresponding classical dynamics is unstable .",
    "some earlier studies indicate that stabilization can be associated with states that are scarred on unstable or weakly stable periodic orbits @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we examine a time - periodic system with one space dimension which shows signs of stabilization . in this system",
    "the number of localized floquet states , or resonance states , increases as the intensity of the driving field is increased . in sec .",

    "[ newres ] we investigate the relationship between the resonance states and the classical dynamics of the system .",
    "we find that the resonance states that are created as the driving field is increased are associated with unstable periodic orbits in the classical dynamics .",
    "we give an explanation , based on this association with periodic orbits , for why the number of resonance states increases as the laser field is increased .    in sec .",
    "[ resac ] we carry out a detailed study of an avoided crossing between two resonance states .",
    "avoided crossings in time - periodic quantum systems lead to significant changes in the structure of the floquet states @xcite .",
    "overlapping avoided crossings can even lead to delocalization of floquet states @xcite .",
    "since stabilization depends upon the floquet states remaining localized near ( stable or unstable ) classical structures , avoided crossings may play an important role in destroying stabilization . finally , in sec .",

    "this is not surprising since the time - averaged k - h description is only accurate for very high frequency driving fields . since the frequency of the driving field used by bmk and in this work ( @xmath6 a.u . ) is lower than the frequency of motion for two of the bound states in the undriven system ( @xmath22 a.u . and",

    "it is somewhat surprising that the time - averaged k - h description is qualitatively accurate because the classical motion of the system in the time - averaged k - h frame is stable while the classical motion of the true system is largely unstable .",
    "for @xmath24 the time - averaged potential in the k - h frame is a double well with minima separated by approximately @xmath25 .",

    "in recent years the technique of complex coordinate scaling ( ccs ) has been used extensively in the study of open quantum systems . in this section",
    "we will review two versions of complex coordinate scaling ( standard and exterior scaling ) and show how these techniques can be used to compute the resonance states of an open , time - periodic system .",
    "results from the standard and exterior scaling versions are compared , for both time - independent and time - dependent calculations .",
    "we first examine how the eigenvalues and eigenstates of a time - independent open system can be calculated using standard complex coordinate scaling ( ccs ) , a technique that is examined in detail in @xcite . in this paper",

    "it may be that state @xmath117 somehow gains stability at the expense of states @xmath114 and @xmath115 , even though it does not appear to pick up any of the structure of those states .",
    "note that there are slight differences between the husimi distributions of states @xmath114 and @xmath115 at @xmath123 a.u . and the corresponding distributions at @xmath121 a.u . , but these may be due to a small amount of mixing with state @xmath117 or with continuum states .",
    "figure [ huscross ] does not reveal any significant increase in the delocalization of any of the resonance states .",
    "it does indicate that an avoided crossing of this type might lead to changes in the lifetimes of the resonance states , but although two states have their lifetimes decreased the third has its lifetime increased .",
    "there is no clear indication that this type of avoided crossing contributes to the destruction of the resonance states that might prevent stabilization at very high intensities of the driving field .",
    "we expect that the destruction of resonance states occurs primarily as the result of coupling between a resonance state and the continuum rather than between resonance states @xcite .",
    "= 3.2 in = 3.1 in 0.2 cm    avoided crossings between resonance states may play an important role in other phenomena in this system .",
    "for example , it has been shown in bound systems that avoided crossings between floquet eigenstates can result in increased high harmonic generation ( hhg ) .",
    "avoided crossings contribute to increased hhg in two ways .",
    "during the turn - on of a laser field avoided crossings can put the quantum system into a superposition of floquet states that may emit radiation at higher frequencies than would be emitted by a single floquet state @xcite .",
    "avoided crossings also contribute to hhg by spreading the floquet states over a wider range of energy , thus allowing a single floquet state to emit higher frequency radiation . for the type of avoided crossing observed here the states",
    "are only delocalized near the exact field strength at which the avoided crossing occurs , because at this field strength the floquet states have mixed their structure @xcite . at that particular field strength ,",
    "though , this effect could lead to increased hhg .",
    "in fact , increased hhg has been observed in previous studies of the avoided crossings in this system @xcite .",
    "we utilize the complex coordinate floquet method ( ccfm ) to calculate resonances for an inverted gaussian potential driven by a monochromatic field .",
    "as has been previously observed , we find that the number of resonance states increases as the field strength is increased .",
    "this behavior in the quantum system seems to be opposite to what is observed in the classical system , where the dynamics becomes increasingly unstable as the field strength is increased .",
    "an examination of the husimi distributions of the resonance states in this system shows that the newly created resonances states are associated with unstable periodic orbits in the classical motion .",
    "this scarring of the eigenstates on unstable periodic orbits has been seen in other systems and it represents one of the most significant deviations of quantum dynamics from the corresponding classical dynamics . in this system ,",
    "resonance eigenstates are scarred on unstable periodic orbits and the movement of the periodic orbits in the phase space allows for the creation of new resonance states as the field strength is increased . the creation of these new resonance states might help to stabilize the system against ionization in intense fields .",
    "an avoided crossing between resonance states is closely examined and it is found that , although two states do exchange their structure during the avoided crossing , there is no significant delocalization of the resonance states as a result of this avoided crossing . coupling to the continuum is more likely to destroy resonance states than is coupling between two resonance states . avoided crossings of the type studied here , although they may not lead to faster ionization , could lead to many interesting effects such as increased high harmonic generation .",
