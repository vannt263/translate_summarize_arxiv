    "_ ab initio _ molecular dynamics based on density functional theory ( dft ) is becoming an important tool for studying the plethora of structural and dynamical processes in a broad range of systems in material science , chemistry , biology and physics.@xcite the application of this approach to very large systems is still limited by the computational scaling of the electronic structure portion of the calculation , regardless of whether one uses a lagrangian - based or born - oppenheimer - based methods .",
    "this is because of the cubic scaling involved in solving the kohn - sham equations coupled with the need to iterate to self - consistency or to propagate the kohn - sham ( ks ) orbitals , as both of these options further increases the computational times by an order of magnitude .",
    "significant advances in these respects have been made along two major directions .",
    "one primary direction is based on a lagrangian formulation of density functional theory  @xcite and circumvents the need for scf iterations by propagation of the ks orbitals .",
    "this venue does not eliminate the cubic scaling and is therefore limited to relatively small systems .",
    "another approach is based on linear - scaling techniques  @xcite , that reduces the algorithmic complexity by finding the density matrix directly , relying on its asymptotic sparseness in real - space .",
    "however , sparsity sets in only for very large systems , limiting the applicability sparse - matrix methods , especially in 3d .    in a recent set of papers",
    "we have introduced the stochastic dft ( sdft ) method  @xcite which scales linearly ( or even sublinearly ) with the system size and does not rely on the sparsity of the density matrix .",
    "sdft is a general approach to electronic structure based on a stochastic process and is applicable to extended ordered as well as disordered materials .",
    "the success of sdft in reducing the scaling comes at a price of introducing a stochastic error in all its predictions , including forces , and that precludes application to _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics .    in this paper",
    "we show that sdft can be used to study equilibrium structural properties of large ncs , despite the statistical fluctuations in the force estimates .",
    "for this , we invoke the langevin equation following the work of attaccalite and sorella,@xcite and generate a sequence of configurations distributed according to the canonical ensemble .",
    "these configurations can be used in a variety of applications for studying the structural , electronic and optical properties of ncs . here",
    "we demonstrate their use for studying the structural properties of silicon nanocrystals ( ncs ) with a diameter of up to @xmath0  nm , and @xmath1 electrons .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : section  [ sec : methods ] includes an overview of the sdft method , a variance reducing method based on embedded fragments sdft,@xcite applicable for covalently bonded systems ( described in detail also in appendix  [ sec : the - embedded - fragments ] ) .",
    "the section also includes a discussion of langevin dynamics propagators , the parameters , and the validation of the approach .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] includes the application of the method for studying structural properties of large si ncs from cryogenic to room temperatures .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] concludes .",
    "kohn - sham density functional theory  @xcite maps a system of @xmath2 interacting electrons in an external electron - nucleus potential @xmath3 , where @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) are the nuclei positions and @xmath6 are their charge ( @xmath7 is the electron charge ) , onto a system of _ non - interacting _ electrons ( the ks system ) , having the same ground - state density @xmath8 .",
    "this mapping is performed by solving the ks equations  @xcite @xmath9 where the ks hamiltonian is :    @xmath10    and the ks potential @xmath11 is the sum of the external electron - nuclear potential @xmath12 , the density - dependent hartree potential @xmath13 , and the exchange - correlation potential @xmath14 : @xmath15 in the ks system , the density is expressed in terms of the normalized single electron ks eigenstates @xmath16 and eigenvalues @xmath17 @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the heaviside function and @xmath20 is the chemical potential chosen so that @xmath21 .",

    "when the trace is performed using the ks eigenstates , the computational cost remains @xmath23 similar to the traditional approach .",
    "however , since the trace is invariant to the basis , alternative schemes that potentially lead to improved scaling can be used .",

    "a converged self - consistent solution of eq .  ( [ eq : stoch - dens ] ) provides an estimate of the electron density and in addition can be used to generate other quantities , such as the density of states ( dos ) , the total energy per electron , and the forces acting on the nuclei .",
    "all estimates contain a statistical error that can be controlled by increasing the number of stochastic orbitals ( @xmath27 ) used to evaluate the trace in eq .",
