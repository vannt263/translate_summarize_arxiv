    "one of the main goals of the atlas and cms general purpose detectors at the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite , a proton - proton collider with a design centre - of - mass energy of @xmath2 tev , is to search for new physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) .",
    "a widely favoured bsm candidate is supersymmetry ( susy ) , which will be introduced in subsection  [ ssec : susy ] .",
    "several strategies can be applied to search for _ direct _ experimental evidence of susy at a collider experiment . in these proceedings , i will present a wide cross - section through susy search analyses at atlas and cms , grouped by lepton multiplicity , since each of these channels involves a specific class of backgrounds .",
    "a special focus will be placed on techniques to measure background contributions from data .",
    "atlas and cms detectors are the two major general purpose experiments at the lhc . both can be characterised as classical collider detectors with full solid angle coverage .",
    "major components of atlas  @xcite are the inner detector , consisting of the pixel detector , the semiconductor tracker and the transition radiation tracker ; the liquid argon electromagnetic and the hadronic calorimeters ; as well as the muon spectrometer .",
    "the inner detector is situated inside of a 2 t solenoidal magnetic field , whereas the muon spectrometer features a toroidal magnetic field with a bending power of 1.5 to 5tm in the barrel  @xcite .",
    "the most striking feature of the cms detector  @xcite is that the inner tracker and the calorimetry are immersed inside of a compact solenoidal 4 t magnetic field , which reverses its direction in the muon spectrometer .",
    "the main components of cms are : the pixel and semi - conducting strip detector , the lead tungstate electromagnetic calorimeter , the hadronic calorimeter , and the muon spectrometer .",
    "the standard model of elementary particle physics is a relativistically and local gauge invariant , renormalisable quantum field theory of strong and electroweak interactions . in recent decades",
    ", it has proven extremely successful in explaining the observed phenomena . however , evidence is mounting  @xcite that it is merely a low - energy approximation of another theory .",
    "one of the major problems of the standard model is arguably the hierarchy problem  @xcite .",
    "an elegant and sthetic solution is offered by supersymmetry ( susy )  @xcite , which for each particle of the standard model postulates a supersymmetric partner with the same quantum numbers , but with spin quantum number different by  1/2 .",
    "this naturally solves the hierarchy problem . in this report",
    ", i will only focus on the the simplest supersymmetric extension of the standard model , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )  @xcite .",
    "an elegant mechanism for spontaneous soft supersymmetry breaking required for theoretical sanity is proposed by supergravity ( sugra ) .",
    "it postulates susy breaking in a `` hidden '' sector at a scale of around 10@xmath3gev , which is mediated to the `` visible '' sector by flavour - blind gravitational interactions .",
    "another well - known mechanism is gauge mediated symmetry breaking ( gmsb ) , where the breaking happens at a much lower scale and is mediated via an intermediate messenger sector by @xmath4 interactions .",
    "lepton and baryon quantum number conservation provides a strong phenomenoligical constraint on any extension to the standard model , since we know experimentally that the lifetime of the proton is longer than @xmath5s  @xcite .",
    "this property is preserved if absolute @xmath1-parity conservation is imposed  @xcite .",
    "consequences of r - parity conservation are that particles must be pair - produced and that the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is stable , which makes it , if not electromagnetically or strongly charged , a perfect candidate for dark matter  @xcite .",
    "the resulting generic experimental signature is characterised by two decay chains of supersymmetric particles , and significant @xmath6 values from the lsps escaping detection .",
    "both atlas and cms have developed search analyses based on these generic signatures , while significant efforts have been made to avoid specialisation towards any particular point in the msugra phase space .",
    "i will describe some of these searches in this section , ordered by lepton multiplicity .",
    "all the figures presented below are for 1@xmath0  unless stated otherwise .",
    "the sugra parameter space is much too large to be experimentally investigated in its entirety .",
    "experimentally it is convenient to explore a phenomenologically simplified model , the minimal version of supergravity ( msugra ) , which is governed by only 5 parameters at gut scale  @xcite .",
    "although msugra imposes particular mass relationships , its phase space is expected to cover a wide variety of signature types expected in sugra and to some extent in mssm . for detailed simulation studies , both atlas and cms collaborations",
    "have defined a set of representative benchmark points in the msugra parameter space .",

    "such high @xmath13  values can come about if one or more of the jets are mismeasured .",
    "in such a case , the @xmath13  vector will tend to be aligned with the vector of the most mismeasured jet with the highest @xmath25 .",
