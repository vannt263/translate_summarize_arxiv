    "in recent years optical interferometers have proven that they can produce excellent science in the field of stellar and circumstellar astrophysics . over the same period",
    "high - resolution spectrographs have enabled the discovery of the first extra - solar planets , and contributed substantially to great progress in the field of asteroseismology .    a number of current interferometric instruments have some spectroscopic capabilities .",
    "for example the mid- and near - infrared instruments midi ( the mid - infrared instrument , at the vlti ) and amber ( astronomical multiple beam recombiner , at the vlti ) provide spectral resolutions of up to @xmath0 and @xmath1 , over bandpasses of @xmath2  @xmath3 m and @xmath4  nm , respectively . at the chara array ,",
    "the vega ( visible spectrograph and polarimeter ) project is under construction with a spectral resolution of @xmath5 and a bandpass of @xmath4  nm . for science results obtained with spectrally resolved interferometry see for example @xcite and @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the combination of very high spectral resolution over a bandpass greater than a few tens of nanometer , to enable a real analog to classical echelle spectroscopy with interferometric spatial resolution is not yet available .    in building a dedicated high - resolution echelle spectrograph for an existing interferometer such as the vlti",
    ", one would face several challenges .",
    "first of all , building a high - resolution spectrograph is a very costly and time - intensive undertaking .",
    "in addition it would be hard to justify building such an instrument only for use with an interferometer , as current optical interferometers are still restricted to very bright objects in comparison with single telescopes .",
    "furthermore , high - resolution spectrographs are usually large instruments , while the space available in the beam combining laboratories of interferometers is often limited .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that such a dedicated instrument will be built in the near future .    in this article",
    "we advocate a different approach . by using an existing spectrograph and only building an interface between it and an interferometer at the same site",
    ", the combination of high spectral and spatial resolution could be achieved on a much shorter timescale , and for a fraction of the cost of a complete new instrument .",
    "the pre - existing infrastructure would need to consist of two telescopes , delay lines for path compensation , a fringe sensing unit to acquire and stabilize the fringes , and a high - resolution spectrograph on the same site .",
    "these conditions are already fulfilled , or will be fulfilled in the very near future , at several observatories .",
    "the two most promising sites are :    * in the southern hemisphere at paranal observatory with the vlti in combination with the uves spectrograph at unit telescope 2 ( ut2 ) , or the high - resolution ir echelle spectrometer ( crires ) spectrograph at ut1 .",
    "* in the northern hemisphere at mauna kea with the keck interferometer ( ki ) and high resolution echelle spectrometer ( hires ) at keck i telescope or the nirspec spectrograph at keck ii .",
    "also at mauna kea , the ohana ( optical hawaiian array for nanoradian astronomy ) interferometer is currently under development , and will allow the combination of several other pairs of telescopes at the manual kea site .    in each case , three additional hardware components would be required :    1 .   a beam combiner that accepts two input beams from the telescopes and feeds the outputs carrying the fringe signals ( coded as intensity variations ) into fiber feeds ; 2 .",
    "fibers that connect the interferometer to the spectrograph ; 3 .   a fiber head that feeds the light from the fibers into the spectrograph .",
    "if separate telescopes are available for interferometry ( as in the case of the auxiliary telescopes of the vlti ) , the impact on the single - telescope - use of the spectrograph would be minimal , as it could be used in the interferometric mode during times when other instruments are scheduled for use with the main telescope .",
    "the outline of this article is as follows . in section",
    "[ sect : science ] the scientific motivation for the proposed setup will be discussed .",
    "section  [ instrument ] will give an overview of the challenges in designing and building the proposed instrument , and their possible solutions .",
    "in section  [ sect : test_case:_vlti_uves ] we will give more information about the proposed combination of the vlti with the uves spectrograph , and its expected performance .",
    "partial and preliminary results of this work have been presented in @xcite .",
    "section [ sect : other_interferometer - spectrograph_pairings ] highlights the main points for other possible interferometer - spectrograph pairings , and section  [ conclusion ] gives our conclusions .",
    "by taking advantage of the existing infrastructure and instrumentation at the observatories , the proposed interface between a high - resolution spectrograph and an optical / near - infrared interferometer can provide some unparalleled capabilities in a time- and cost - efficient manner .",
    "most importantly , interferometry can be performed with sufficiently high spectral resolution to resolve absorption lines allowing visibility changes across spectral lines to be measured even in late - type stars .",
    "the interferometric spectra would also cover a wide wavelength band . using the broad spectral coverage",
    ", one would be able to use cross - correlation techniques to obtain very accurate radial - velocities and line shapes , which have proven extremely helpful in planet search programs and asteroseismology .",
    "although restricted to observations of relatively bright stars , interferometry at high spectral resolution will provide hitherto inaccessible information on stellar rotation properties , atmospheric structure and surface features , and can have a profound impact on a large number of open questions in stellar astrophysics .",
    "measuring the variation of the stellar diameter with wavelength , or even better determining wavelength - dependent limb darkening profiles , can provide a sensitive probe for the structure of strongly - extended atmospheres of cool giant stars .",
    "such data can be directly compared with predictions of theoretical models , and provide qualitative new tests of state - of - the - art three - dimensional stellar model atmospheres @xcite .",
    "these models make predictions for the emergent spectrum at every point of the stellar disk . to compare model predictions with data from traditional spectroscopy",
    ", they have to be integrated over the full disk first .",
    "in contrast , interferometric spectroscopy gives access to the center - to - limb variation of the emergent spectrum , and is thus naturally suited to comparisons with model atmospheres .",
    "first steps in this direction has been made with the mark iii and coast interferometers and with aperture masking , by measuring the diameters of a sample of cool giant stars in filters centered on deep tio absorption bands and filters in the nearby continuum @xcite .",
    "many stars are found to be substantially larger in the tio bands , and to have wavelength - dependent asymmetry .",
    "it is easy to understand the principle behind these effects : we effectively measure the diameter of the @xmath6 = 1 surface of the star ( taking limb darkening into account properly ) , and the height of that surface varies with opacity and therefore with wavelength . in cool stars",
    "this variation may be so large ( up to @xmath7% of the stellar diameter for `` normal '' giants , even more for pulsating variables ) that it can be observed as a variation of the effective stellar diameter with wavelength .",
    "the higher parts of the atmospheres are cooler , making the brightness distribution across the stellar surface in absorption bands more sensitive to asymmetries in the temperature distribution .",
    "the large spectral widths of the filters used for these interferometric observations average over many tio absorption lines with different strengths .",
    "interferometric high - resolution spectroscopy will provide much more detailed information on the diameter and limb darkening profiles as a function of tio absorption depth , and thus substantially better constraints on the theoretical models .    out of the giant stars which have been observed ,",
    "the variations of the apparent diameter and limb darkening profile with wavelength are most pronounced in mira stars .",
    "the instrument proposed here will enable detailed investigations of the pulsation and wind acceleration mechanisms .",
    "again , high spectral resolution is required to sample a large range of depths in the stellar atmosphere .",
    "the advantage of combining high spatial and spectral resolution together in one observation of an object rather than using separate observations in this context has also been pointed out by e.g.  @xcite .",
    "classical doppler imaging ( di ) has been developed into a very powerful tool ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this technique allows mapping of the chemical and magnetic properties of stellar photospheres with surprisingly small details . up to now",
    ", line profiles have been used for di which are based on average atmospheric structures ; this can obviously only be an approximation , in particular in regions of extreme abundance peculiarity .",
    "tools are now available to compute such stellar atmospheres more accurately ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a reduced abundance contrast between spots and their surrounding is expected .",
    "interferometric high - resolution spectroscopy data will allow a direct check of the models , because abundance analyses can be performed for individual surface regions of prominent chemically peculiar stars .",
    "the same approach is also applicable for other stars with inhomogeneous surface properties , like active cool giant stars , as interferometry allows the study of individual surface regions .",
    "the fact that interferometry can isolate the active regions will partly compensate for the lower total signal - to - noise compared to single - telescope spectra , which always average over the whole stellar surface .",
    "the spectral resolution needed depends on the projected rotational velocity of the star ( @xmath8 ) and is likely to be greater then @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the required snr will vary considerably from case to case , as it depends on the contrast of the structure to be imaged , on the number of lines that can be used for the analysis , and on the amount of any a priori knowledge available for di .",
    "radial and non - radial stellar oscillations lead to characteristic surface patterns of line shapes and central velocities .",
    "the reconstruction of these patterns from line profile variations alone is plagued with ambiguities , however .",
    "these can to a large extent be resolved by the additional phase information contained in interferometric data @xcite .",
    "this means that pulsation modes can be identified uniquely without any need for comparisons with theoretical models .",
    "empirical mode identification with interferometric spectroscopy could become an important tool in the field of asteroseismology @xcite .",
    "a spectral resolution of the order of @xmath10 will be needed with snr per spectral resolution element of order 100 to 200 @xcite .",
    "observations with lower snr may still be used in conjunction with cross correlation techniques ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "spatially resolved observations may also provide access to higher - order ( @xmath11 ) modes , which have very small amplitudes and therefore normally not detectable in disk - averaged data .",
    "radial - velocity observations of main - sequence stars have yielded more than 300 planet detections so far .",
    "the wealth of information from these surveys has revolutionized the field of planetary system physics , but little is known about the incidence of planets around stars with masses higher than about @xmath12  m@xmath13 , because more massive main - sequence stars are difficult targets for radial - velocity observations .",
    "surveys of k giants can provide this information , and planets around such stars have indeed been detected @xcite .",
    "planets in highly eccentric orbits can be easily identified as such in high - precision radial - velocity data due to the distinct shape of the keplerian velocity variations , but sinusoidal variations observed in a number of objects in ongoing radial - velocity surveys of k giants could be due either to planetary companions or to low - order non - radial g - mode pulsations .",
    "it is possible in principle to distinguish between these possibilities by analyzing the line shapes ( which should vary along with the radial velocity in the case of pulsations , but remain stable in the case of companions ) , but this requires very high spectral resolution and signal - to - noise .",
    "observations with interferometric spectroscopy could resolve the stellar disk and hence distinguish more easily between these possibilities , which would help to establish the mass function of planets around stars with masses between @xmath14 and @xmath15  m@xmath13 .",
    "similar arguments apply to other cases in which radial - velocity variations could plausibly be attributed to different mechanisms , either related to stellar variability or to companions .",
    "limb darkening curves measured for a spectral line can provide direct measurements of the projection factors of cepheid pulsations , which relate the true velocity of the pulsation to the observed radial - velocity curve .",
    "uncertainties in this `` p factor '' , which presently must be computed from theoretical models , are a serious limiting factor in current estimates of cepheid distances with the baade - wesselink method @xcite .",
    "interferometric spectroscopy can thus eliminate one of the important contributions to the error budget for distances to cepheids and other variable stars .",
    "stellar rotation induces a difference in the fringe phase between the red wings and the blue wings of stellar absorption lines in resolved interferometric observations .",
    "measuring the position angle of the phase gradient allows determination of the orientation of the stellar axis on the sky @xcite .",
    "more detailed modeling of the interferometric signal can also provide the inclination of the stellar rotation axis @xcite .",
    "high resolution spectroscopy will thus open a way to determine the orientation of stellar rotational axes in space .    to know the orientation of the stellar axes in space is of particular interest in double- or multiple - star systems .",
    "one can determine whether the rotation axes of binaries are aligned with each other , and with the orbital rotation axes of the systems .",
    "the orientation of the rotational axes contains information about the origin and evolution of the system .",
    "such measurements have only be done for close eclipsing binary systems as one can take advantage of the rossiter ",
    "mclaughlin effect during eclipses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however as short - period systems are synchronized early in their life it is important to measure the orientation axes for systems with larger semi - major axes , as they are of fundamental importance for theories of binary star formation . here",
    "the probability that one can observe a eclipse and take advantage of the rossiter ",
    "mclaughlin effect is small .",
    "one can also search for ( partial ) alignment of rotation axes in star forming regions and stellar clusters .",
    "interactions between stars in multiple systems and other stars in a stellar cluster change the angular momentum of the systems .",
    "the orientation of the stellar rotation axes will be of special interest for stars which harbor planets , since the mutual inclination between the orbital plane of the companion and the rotation axis of the star can provide insights into the formation and evolution processes of the planet .",
    "if the orbital evolution of planetary systems is dominated by few - body scattering processes , or the kozai mechanism , one might expect to find orbits that are not aligned with the stellar angular momentum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the spin - orbit alignment has been measured in a small number of systems with transiting extrasolar planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "recently , the first planetary system with a likely misalignment , xo-3 , has been found @xcite . as for the binary systems these measurements",
    "are restricted to systems with short orbital periods . in the near future",
    ", astrometric orbits will become available from ground - based and space - based astrometry with the phase - referenced imaging and micro - arcsecond astrometry ( prima ) facility at the vlti , the space interferometry mission ( sim ) , and with gaia .",
    "combining this information with interferometric high resolution observations will provide the relative inclination between the orbital and equatorial plane for a large number of planets in a variety of orbits .",
    "along with the oscillation spectrum , differential rotation is a powerful diagnostic for the interior structure of a star .",
    "unfortunately , observations of differential rotation are difficult with classical spectroscopy , and degeneracies exist between inclination , limb darkening , and differential rotation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these degeneracies can be resolved by the additional information from interferometric spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "high spectral resolution is of the essence for this application , giving the proposed type of instrument a decisive advantage over more conventional interferometric spectrographs such as amber .",
    "velocity - resolved interferometric observations of emission lines can be used to determine the structure and velocity field of disks around pre - main - sequence objects and be stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is possible to determine the disk opening angle and the rotation law in the disk , to measure the location of the inner edge of the disk , and to obtain detailed information on possible asymmetries caused by spiral waves .",
    "interferometric observations of winds and outflows from pre - main - sequence stars and from evolved objects can be used to determine their extent and overall geometry , and to probe sub - structure such as clumps and shells .",
    "these observations will not need the full spectral resolution offered by high - resolution optical spectrographs , but access to the h@xmath16 line is of critical importance .",
    "in this section we describe our proposal for combining an optical / ir interferometer with a high - resolution spectrograph .",
    "figure  [ fig : schematic_infrastrucutre ] shows a schematic drawing of the combined instrument , while a possible design for the beam combiner is shown in figure  [ fig : schematic_beam_combiner ] .",
    "special attention is given to longitudinal dispersion compensation ( section [ sect : dispersion_compensation ] ) .",
    "this has to be addressed if one wants to perform long integrations ( several minutes ) over a wide bandpass , one of the key abilities of the proposed instrument .",
    "schematic of the combined instrument , interferometer and spectrograph .",
    "the proposed instrument relies on pre - existing infrastructure ( telescopes , fringe - tracker , delay lines and a spectrograph located within a few hundred meters ) .",
    "the additional components which must be built include the variable dispersion compensator , beam combiner , fiber coupling , optical fibers and fiber - feed for the spectrograph.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]     schematic of the suggested beam combiner for the coupling of a spectrograph to an interferometer .",
    "the beam from one telescope passes through a k - prism which introduces an achromatic phase shift of @xmath17 between the s and p polarizations .",
    "the beam from the other telescope passes through longitudinal dispersion compensators .",
    "the combination of the two beams in the beam - splitter introduces a phase shift of @xmath18 between the two output beams .",
    "the two polarizations of the two output beams are separated by the polarizing beam - splitters , resulting in four beams with phase relations of @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath18 , @xmath21 entering the fibers.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]      the earth s atmosphere distorts planar incoming wavefronts from an unresolved astronomical source , introducing phase fluctuations as a function of position and time @xcite .",
    "these fluctuations are commonly described by a kolmogorov spectrum @xcite with constant fried parameter @xmath22 @xcite . in order to obtain stable complex visibilities ,",
    "the incoming stellar wavefronts at the beam combiner have to be flat ( with constant wavefront phase as a function of position in the pupil plane for an unresolved star ) .",
    "this can be achieved using either :    1 .",
    "telescope aperture diameters small enough that the atmospherically - induced phase variations are negligible with @xmath23 ( this may require a variable pupil stop ) ; 2 .",
    "tip - tilt correction making wavefront errors negligible on aperture diameters up to @xmath24 ; or 3 .",
    "higher - order adaptive optics .",
    "larger apertures can be used at longer wavelengths or under better seeing conditions , as the fried parameter varies as @xmath25 and @xmath26 for observations at a wavelength @xmath27 and with a seeing disk of fwhm@xmath28 .      to compensate for the difference in path length from the two telescopes to the source , optical path",
    "must be added to one arm of the interferometer .",
    "this is typically achieved through the use of _ optical trombone _ delay lines or through the stretching of optical fibers @xcite .",
    "if the optical delay compensation is performed in a dispersive medium , the optical path difference ( opd ) where the fringes are found will vary with wavelength .",
    "longitudinal dispersion can affect the opd in the proposed instrument concept in two ways :    1 .",
    "dispersion will give a variation of optical delay across the wavelength range of the spectrograph ; 2 .",
    "if the spectrograph operates in a different waveband from the fringe tracker , dispersion will introduce a different opd in the spectrograph waveband to that in the fringe - tracking waveband .    for a typical high - resolution spectrograph",
    "the coherence length of the fringes in each spectral channel is much larger than the optical delay offsets introduced by dispersion .",
    "however , time variation of the dispersion during a spectrograph detector integration will blur the interference fringes , reducing the measured visibility amplitude .",
    "the two principal sources of variation in optical delay due to dispersion are :    1 .   during an observation",
    "the position of the object on the sky changes . to keep the interference fringes at a stable position ,",
    "the additional optical path introduced in one arm of the interferometer must be varied as the earth rotates .",
    "the change in optical path through the dispersive medium in one arm of the interferometer causes the visibility phase to vary differently at each wavelength , unless the delay variation is introduced with an evacuated delay line . during the course of an observation of several minutes",
    "this inevitably leads to a loss of fringe contrast for observations in a waveband of non - zero bandwidth .",
    "for example , during a @xmath29-minute visible - light integration , the geometric delay path can change by several meters ( see figure  [ fig : opd1 ] and figure  [ fig : opd2 ] ) , which would lead to a relative opd shift of several @xmath3 m between r band and i band . 2 .",
    "a change in the temperature or humidity of the air in one of the optical paths to the star will introduce a change in the column density of air and/or water vapor . to first order",
    ", these changes will be corrected by the fringe tracking .",
    "the residuals are not expected to be large enough to give different delays for different spectral channels in the spectrograph bandpass . however",
    ", if the spectrograph is operating in a different waveband from the fringe tracker , the optical delay in the spectrograph waveband may differ from that in the fringe tracking waveband .",
    "both dispersion problems could be circumvented by restricting the exposure time , but this would reduce the observational efficiency , and in the read - noise limited regime it would reduce the limiting magnitude .",
    "reducing the spectral bandwidth would solve point above , but would limit the spectral coverage of the observations . as one",
    "can see in figure  [ fig : opd1 ] and figure  [ fig : opd2 ] , the change in opd depends on the declination of the star and on the alignment of the baseline with the rotation axis of the earth .",
    "therefore , restricting the baseline geometry and restricting the selection of sources would also circumvent point above .",
    "this would seriously reduce the usefulness of the proposed instrument .    a better way to address point above would be to equip the beam combiner with a variable atmospheric dispersion compensator ( see e.g.  section  [ sect : dispersion_compensation_at_uves - i ] ) .",
    "this dispersion compensator would correct for the differential dispersion introduced by the few meters of additional path between the two telescopes added during the course of the observations ; it does not need to correct for the full differential air path .",
    "point can be addressed by estimating the dispersion at the wavelength of the spectrograph using measurements of the ambient environmental conditions @xcite and the variation of optical delay with wavelength across the fringe - tracking bandpass .",
    "if the fringe tracker can not operate sufficiently far from the zero optical group - delay point , then an additional delay line will be required in order to provide a different geometrical delay for the spectrograph than is used for light that is sent to the fringe tracker , as shown in figure  [ fig : schematic_infrastrucutre ] .",
    "the proposed instrument scheme relies on the interferometer having a fringe - tracking capability .",
    "the fringe tracking must keep the fringes of the spectroscopic observation stable even if they are observed at a different wavelength to the one used for fringe tracking .",
    "the fringes in the spectroscopic instrument must be kept stable to a fraction of a wavelength ( typically @xmath30rad of visibility phase ) .",
    "a number of existing interferometers already have fringe - tracking instruments @xcite .",
    "the rms noise ( the jitter ) in the optical delay from the fringe tracking will cause a reduction in the visibility amplitude by a factor @xmath31 :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the rms variation in the optical delay compensation in a spectral channel with wavelength @xmath27 during a detector integration .    if the fringe tracking wavelength differs from the science wavelength , differential refraction in the earth s atmosphere will cause an additional reduction in visibility amplitude for high zenith angles ( airmass @xmath34 ) of the target star @xcite .",
    "this effect depends on the dispersion between the wavelengths of fringe tracking and observation , and therefore increases strongly towards the blue .",
    "as the proposed instrument will be used only for observations at lower airmass we do not include this into our performance analysis in sect .",
    "[ sect : performance ] .          the primary observable in an interferometer is the complex visibility ( having amplitude and phase ) , proportional to the complex coherence function of the radiation received by the two telescopes @xcite .",
    "the complex visibility can be derived in a number of ways , for example using a fixed delay offset and measuring the fringe signal as a function of wavelength in the spectrum @xcite . alternatively , to obtain the full information on the complex visibility in each spectral channel , one can measure the four fringe quadratures at each wavelength , i.e. measure the light intensity with fringe phase offsets of @xmath19 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath35 radians .",
    "the normalized light intensities as a function of wavelength @xmath27 in these four outputs are commonly called @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 respectively .",
    "the @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 outputs can be produced using @xmath40% beam - splitter(s ) ( providing a @xmath18 phase shift between the output beams ) and achromatic @xmath17 phase shifts in two of the four output beams ( see e.g. figure [ fig : schematic_beam_combiner ] ) .",
    "the complex visibility @xmath41 in the spectral channel at wavelength @xmath27 is then fully described by the four intensities @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 :    @xmath42    where @xmath43 .    the squared amplitude of this visibility estimate @xmath44 and the argument ( fringe phase ) @xmath45",
    "are given by :    @xmath46    applying the fringe estimators on a wavelength - by - wavelength basis , one can thus derive the complex visibility as a function of @xmath27 . in eqn .",
    "[ vsqest ] is biased  @xmath47 will be over - estimated in the presence of noise .",
    "slightly modified estimators can be used to give unbiased estimates of @xmath47 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "]    the absolute phase will usually be corrupted by turbulence in the earth s atmosphere , but differential phases can be measured between adjacent spectral channels or between the fringe tracking wavelength and one of the observed spectral channels .",
    "these differential phases can provide very valuable observables , such as phase differences between the red and blue wings of spectral lines . in sources which are resolved in some spectral lines but which are un - resolved at continuum wavelengths ( e.g. be stars , as discussed in section  [ sect : circstellar_matter ] ) , the complex visibilities can be used to make interferometric images of the structure in the spectral lines , using the position of the unresolved continuum source as the phase reference . in this context",
    "it is worth noting that phenomena on scales much smaller than the ` resolution limit ' @xmath48 of the interferometer with baseline @xmath49 are accessible with this technique , because differential phases with a precision of a few degrees provide astrometric accuracy significantly higher than the conventional ( imaging ) resolution limit .",
    "the outputs from the beam combiner can be easily transported to the spectrograph using multi - mode fiber optics .",
    "only the light intensity as a function of wavelength is of interest at this point ( after beam combination ) , so the additional optical path length and longitudinal dispersion from the fiber are unimportant .    for a link at visible or near - infrared wavelengths one could for example use the optran plus wf fiber with a core diameter of @xmath50  @xmath3 m ( see figure  [ fig : fiber_vis_nir ] ) .",
    "fluoride glass fibers could provide better throughput at longer near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "transmission in the wavelength range from @xmath51 to @xmath52  @xmath3 m for @xmath53 m of optran plus wf fiber ( ceramoptec catalog , see http://www.ceramoptec.com / catalog.htm).,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    the insertion of pick - off mirrors might provide a good solution for directing the light from the fibers into the spectrograph .",
    "however , in some infrared slit spectrographs , the slit is located in a cryogenic part of the instrument .",
    "if it is undesirable to make modifications inside the cryogenic dewar , it may be sufficient to place the fibers in an image plane outside the spectrograph dewar .",
    "if the spectrograph is already a fiber - fed instrument , the number of new components will be small and the installation fast .",
    "in this section we investigate in more depth the possible combination of the vlti interferometer with the uves spectrograph .",
    "we name this combination _ uves - i _ in the reminder of this article .",
    "in particular we address here the matter of external fringe tracking and dispersion compensation in sections [ sect : fringe_tracking_uves_i ] and [ sect : dispersion_compensation_at_uves - i ] , respectively .",
    "as mentioned above it is essential to solve these points if one wants to combine a high - resolution echelle spectrograph like uves with an optical interferometer like vlti and carry out long exposures , which has not been done so far .",
    "uves - i would operate in the wavelength range between @xmath54  @xmath3 m and @xmath55  @xmath3 m .",
    "therefore it would use the vlti ats ( @xmath56-m auxiliary telescopes ) and not the uts ( @xmath57-m unit telescopes ) as the multi application curvature adaptive optics ( macao ) adaptive optics systems of the uts do not deliver well - corrected wavefronts in the visible .",
    "the existing tip - tilt correction on the ats would allow the use of @xmath58 sub - apertures with uves - i ( corresponding to @xmath59  cm at @xmath60  nm under typical seeing conditions ) .",
    "to minimize fringe - tracking and tip - tilt correction errors , the prima fringe tracker , the tip - tilt system , and uves - i should all use the same aperture ; a clear off - axis aperture could be chosen for this purpose .",
    "the loss of two magnitudes in fringe tracking sensitivity compared with the full at apertures would be tolerable , as uves - i observations will usually target very bright stars .",
    "an arrangement in which the fringe tracker and tip - tilt sensor use the full aperture , and uves - i the inner 75 cm would provide higher fringe - tracking sensitivity at the cost of increased phase noise in uves - i . with the planned installation of adaptive optics systems at the ats , their full 1.8 m apertures would become useable for uves - i , corresponding to a sensitivity gain of @xmath61mag .",
    "note that this estimate assumes a strehl ratio of @xmath62 at @xmath63  nm , an ambitious value .",
    "the ats currently have a dichroic beam - splitter sending the visible light to the tip - tilt system , and passing the infrared light to the delay lines and instruments .",

    "it is also desirable that no fringe jumps occur during an exposure , as they introduce a delay offset corresponding to one wavelength in the fringe tracking band , and thus a reduction of the visibility in uves - i .",
    "occasional fringe jumps or fringe losses are not detrimental , however , if they are recognized and corrected quickly by the fringe tracker .",
    "for example , if the recovery time from such an event is one second , the visibility loss for a 200s exposure would be 1% at worst , and it would vary slowly with wavelength .",

    "this fringe motion can be accurately predicted from environmental sensor measurements and the known geometrical delay .",
    "it can be stabilized at one wavelength using a delay line , but to give good stabilization over the full @xmath90  nm to @xmath63  nm wavelength range , a variable dispersion corrector is required ( see * ? ? ?",

    "a combination of fused silica and bk7 glass gives the best theoretical performance , but the required glass thickness is relatively high ( see figure  [ fig : two_mat ] , lower panel ) .",
    "we therefore favor an sf10/bk7 combination , which provides compensation to @xmath111  nm even for extreme delay rates , using much thinner glass elements ( see figure  [ fig : two_mat ] , middle panel ) .",
    "the variable dispersion compensator will also compensate for the fixed additional dispersion produced in the k - prism .",
    "in addition to the compensation of the delay differences in the visible band , we must also compensate the delay difference between the visible band and the k - band , where prima tracks the fringes .",
    "this can be done by commanding the prima fringe tracker to fringe track far enough from the k - band group delay zero point to allow compensation of the fringes at visible wavelengths , or alternatively by inserting another additional delay as shown in figure  [ fig : schematic_infrastrucutre ] .",
    "one beam is sent through an achromatic phase shifter , which introduces a @xmath17 phase shift of one polarization state with respect to the other .",
    "this phase shifter can be implemented with a k prism made of bk7 , which provides a nearly achromatic retardation of @xmath17 over most of the visible wavelength range ( see e.g.  bernhard halle product catalog , www.b-halle.de ) .",
    "variable dispersion compensation is applied in the other beam . the dispersion introduced by the k - prism",
    "is also compensated in the dispersion compensator .",
    "two flat mirrors then direct the beams into the main beam combiner ( figure  [ fig : schematic_beam_combiner ] ) . the combined beams , which have a phase shift of @xmath18 relative to each other , are sent to polarizing beam - splitters by a second pair of flat folding mirrors ( see figure [ fig : schematic_beam_combiner ] ) .",

    "for an ideal beam combiner , the complex visibility can then be calculated for each spectral channel using eqn .",

    "it is therefore possible to mostly use standard commercial components ; the use of a specialized high - performance design for the non - polarizing beam splitter with @xmath27-independent near-50/50 splitting ratio and near - zero retardance between s- and p - polarization as discussed e.g.  by shi et al .",

    "a preliminary design of the beam combiner fits on a @xmath116@xmath117 cm breadboard ( see figure  [ fig : instrument ] ) .",
    "this compact design ensures stability and minimizes the space taken up in the beam - combination laboratory of the interferometer . due to its high spectral resolution ,",
    "the coherence length of uves - i is very large ( @xmath118 cm ) .",
    "however , the drift of the optical path difference _ during _ one exposure must not be larger than @xmath4 nm , as this would reduce the fringe visibility due to the fringe blurring ; therefore the uves - i breadboard should be mounted as rigidly as possible to the fringe sensing unit .",
    "this eliminates the necessity of an additional metrology system .",
    "the impact of the proposed combination on the uves instrument would be small .",
    "the uves - i fiber interface to the spectrograph will be similar to the existing link from flames ( fiber large array multi element spectrograph ) to uves @xcite , which has a fiber head for @xmath57 fibers . the uves - i fiber head will be placed after the pre - slit optics and can , when uves - i is used , be injected via a folding mirror .    to retrieve the full interferometric information",
    "only four fibers are needed .",
    "it would thus be possible to use two vlti baselines simultaneously if an eight - fiber feed is used .",
    "this would require both of the prima fringe - tracking units to stabilize the fringes on the two baselines .",
    "interesting , but currently not possible at paranal for an instrument like uves - i , is the simultaneous use of three baselines , which would make it possible to measure a triangle of baselines , and aquire closure phase . for this",
    "a three - way beam combiner , with 12 output fiber is needed and the light from these fibers has to be directed on the spectrograph ccd with sufficiently - low cross - talk between the different orders .",
    "as the light is injected via fibers into the spectrograph the spectral resolution achieved by the instrument no longer depends on the slit size , but on the core diameter of the fiber and the re - imaging optics .",
    "for example using a fiber with a core diameter of @xmath50  @xmath3 m , the fiber whose transmission is shown in figure  [ fig : fiber_vis_nir ] , and with re - imaging optics changing the f/3 fiber output beam into the f/10 beam similar to that produced by the standard pre - slit optics of uves @xcite , a spectral resolution of @xmath119 for uves - i would be achieved , while still making alignment of the fiber - couplers easy .",
    "the detector integration times used should be sufficiently long to ensure that the detector read - noise is not dominant ( see below ) , and sufficiently short to allow compensation of the atmospheric dispersion accumulating during the exposure with a relatively simple device ( see section [ sect : dispersion_compensation ] ) .",
    "this will typically give exposure times between @xmath84min and @xmath120min .",
    "the beam combiner has @xmath121 optical surfaces ( before fiber coupling ) .",
    "the transmissive optics will be covered with anti - reflection coatings optimized for the wavelength range used , while mirrors will be coated in protected silver .",
    "using a conservative assumption of @xmath122% efficiency per mirror surface and @xmath123% efficiency per anti - reflection coated glass element , the resulting overall throughput of the beam combination table is @xmath124% .",
    "the transmission of the fiber link depends on the fiber coupling efficiency as well as the bulk transmission losses in the fiber .",

    "note that the transmission changes from @xmath126% to @xmath127% between @xmath54  @xmath3 m and @xmath55  @xmath3 m    assuming two optical surfaces at each end of the fiber couplers plus one folding mirror which can inject the light into uves while the spectrograph is in interferometric mode , and the transmission efficiencies described above , the total transmission of the uves - i link will vary from @xmath116  % to @xmath128  % over the @xmath54  @xmath3m@xmath55  @xmath3 m wavelength band used .",
    "the system visibility of an interferometer , i.e. , the fringe contrast measured on an unresolved source , depends on the wavefront quality of the two beams and on the accuracy of overlap at the beam combiner .",
    "factors influencing the system visibility include alignment , aberrations in the instrument optics , tracking ( tip - tilt ) errors , and higher - order wavefront errors due to atmospheric seeing . using tip - tilt corrected @xmath58 apertures we expect a mean strehl ratio of @xmath129 from each telescope @xcite , providing a system visibility of order @xmath130 .",
    "the total difference in sensitivity between flames and the uves - i combination depends on the instrument efficiency and the source visibility .",
    "the efficiency due to both the throughput and the system visibility would be equivalent to a loss of @xmath131 magnitudes ( tab .  [",

    "long integrations can be constructed from multiple short exposures with no additional noise penalty in order to reach the required snr .",
    "the signal - to - noise also varies in proportion to the source visibility .",
    "variations in seeing will influence the limiting magnitude of uves - i in two ways : the fringe - tracking performance will decrease with increased seeing and the aperture will need to be stopped down . assuming somewhat worse than typical seeing conditions of @xmath133  m and @xmath134  m at @xmath135  nm ( compared to the values given in sect .  [",
    "sect : fringe_tracking_uves_i ] ) the aperture would need to be stopped down to @xmath136 m to stay at @xmath14 r@xmath137 ( @xmath138 magnitudes ) . together with decreased fringe tracking performance ( @xmath139 magnitudes ) the total loss of sensitivity of uves",
    "- i would be of @xmath140 magnitudes relative to flames .",
    "it should be pointed out that even though the sensitivity of uves - i is significantly lower than that of uves , the final sensitivity compares quite favorably with other optical interferometers especially bearing in mind that the achieved spectral resolution is very high .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio will be further reduced in proportion to the source visibility , but for many measurements described in section  [ sect : science ] the sources need only be marginally resolved , so that the variation of visibility phase with wavelength directly probes offsets in the position of the emitting region .",
    ".comparison of uves - i throughput with the throughput of uves - flames , for operation without adaptive optics ( 0.75 m aperture ) and with adaptive optics ( full 1.8 m aperture of the ats ) .",
    "[ table : uves_i_uves_comp ] [ cols=\"<,^ \" , ]     for example , for a measurement of the phase change across a spectral line the adjacent continuum provides an excellent calibration , allowing measurement of phase changes with wavelength as small as one milliradian .",
    "this means that uves - i will be sensitive to astrometric offsets that are over one hundred times smaller than the resolution limit of the interferometer .",
    "it will not be possible to image such small structures , but models of such astrometric offsets can be constructed and tested with uves - i .    it should be pointed out that not all observing programs will require the full spectral resolution provided by the new instrument . in those cases it will be possible to obtain a higher snr per desired spectral element by binning the data . in the readout - noise - limited regime , this can best be done on the ccd .",
    "this would have the advantage that one would be able to go to fainter targets than stated above with shorter integration times and shorter detector readout times .",
    "often the astrophysical interesting signal is encoded in multiple lines in a spectral region ( section  [ sect : science ] ) . in this case",
    "the snr can be improved by cross - correlating these absorption lines with a line - template mask .",
    "this is routinely done in high - resolution spectroscopy , but has not yet been done with optical interferometers , while it would be possible with an instrument like uves - i .",

    "the throughput of the vlti+crires combination would be higher than uves - i as the transmission of the vlti increases towards longer wavelengths .",
    "the distortions of the incoming wavefronts are also less severe for the longer wavelengths ( see section [ sect : telescopes_ao ] ) , so one would be able to use the full aperture of the ats or make observations with the uts using the macao ao system @xcite . for a combination of crires with the vlti one could use the optran plus wf fiber ( figure  [ fig : fiber_vis_nir ] ) as the transmission for a @xmath53",

    "dispersion compensation techniques are investigated in this article and a solution is presented which allows integration times up to a few minutes .",
    "the implementation of this approach is shown for the example combination uves - vlti .",
    "the resulting instrument would differ from other instruments or efforts taken to achieve high spatial and spectral resolution .",
    "it would offer spectral resolution nearly a factor 2 higher than for any other interferometric instrument , and over a wide spectral range of a few hundred rather than a few tens of nanometers .",
    "it offers the same possibilities to an astronomer as a high - resolution echelle spectrograph behind a single telescope does , plus the high spatial resolution due to the interferometer , albeit only for bright targets .",
    "however it is important to realize that this concept , the combination of two existing instruments to create a new one , is not limited to a specific location or instrument , but rather is an approach which can be followed at different observatories in both hemispheres .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the measurements taken with the proposed instruments are differential in nature ( e.g. change of visibility amplitude and visibility phase over spectral lines ) , allowing many interferometric calibration problems to be circumvented .",
