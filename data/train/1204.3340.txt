    "the formation and coalescence of actomyosin aggregates to exert contractile forces are manifested in pulsed contractions of an actomyosin network that drive epithelial sheet deformation during morphogenesis.@xcite such aggregates also are responsible for a multistage coarsening process that occurs in a bottom - up model system for contractility which has been reconstituted in vitro.@xcite    in reconstituted filament - motor assemblies , relatively _",

    "embryos @xcite and in the minimal in vitro network model .",
    "@xcite in the in vitro system , clusters of various sizes continuously change via fusion and rupture events but the of cluster sizes remains steady .",
    "motor - driven filament sliding and a well - tuned connectivity seem to play a key role in this nonequilibrium steady state .    in the present work , by looking into the intricate interplay between local force generation , network connectivity and collective motor action , we seek to provide a theoretical framework that is capable of accommodating both regular and heterogeneous pattern formation , as well as arrested coarsening and large - scale contraction in a unified manner .",
    "our microscopic model is a motorized cat s cradle @xcite which consists of a crosslinked network of nonlinear elastic filaments where motors generate equal but oppositely directed kicks at motor - bonded node pairs .",
    "this model encodes two essential aspects of actomyosin self - organization : first that individual actin filaments have highly asymmetric responses to loading , resisting large tensile forces but easily buckling under compressive loads .",
    "as a consequence , sheared biopolymer networks exhibit negative normal stresses @xcite comparable in magnitude to the shear stress .",
    "secondly the model captures the fact that motor - induced node movements come in anti - correlated pairs owing to the bipolar minifilaments .",
    "this anti - correlation mimics the relative sliding of neighboring parallel filaments driven by the attached motors .",
    "both aspects are crucial to capturing the formation of a disordered condensed state of actomyosin aggregates .",
    "our coarse - grained model is completely microscopic but bears some resemblance to the macroscopic approach adopted by levine and mackintosh that introduces force dipoles into an elastic continuum@xcite where motor unbinding kinetics leads to enhanced low - frequency stress fluctuations . in the microscopic model",
    "the network connectivity and motor distribution over the bonds of the network are quenched once initially assigned , so that the nonequilibrium dynamics and structures predicted by our model arise solely from the intrinsic activity of motors firmly built into the network driving correlated motions stochastically .",
    "this assumption is in line with the fact that the _ in vitro _ structures are irreversibly assembled because many protein factors found _ in vivo _ that allow fast pattern renewals are left out of the reconstitution , such as disassembly of contractile structures and transience of actin crosslinking proteins .",
    "the model highlights the key role in determining the course of structural development played by the motor susceptibility , a parameter characterizing how sensitively the motors respond to imposed forces .",
    "the coupling between motor kinetics and the structure leads to a double - way feedback : motor action induces structural changes of the network and thus modifies the local mechanical environment of the motors , which in turn changes the load - dependent motor response .",
    "in the same spirit as our earlier work on the statistical mechanics of systems with uncorrelated kicks on each node @xcite , we adopt a master equation description but treat small - step spatially _ anti - correlated _ kicks in order to mimic contractile - ratchet - like @xcite incremental deformations of actomyosin networks .",
    "we again obtain an effective fokker - planck equation in the small kick limit .",
    "but the correlations lead to _ local _ effective temperature @xmath0 and diffusion coefficients @xmath1 , which now both become tensors and also depend on the _ instantaneous _ local network structure .",
    "more interestingly , anti - correlated kicking leads to a modification of the bare interaction .",
    "essentially new forces come into play through the action of the motors .",
    "this motor - induced force depends linearly on the motor activity to quadratic order in kick step size and decays in space as the inverse distance in three dimensions , resembling a logarithmically growing potential . by treating the motor - bonded node pairs as  functional units \" and deriving a pair - level steady - state solution of the effective fokker - planck equation ,",
    "we demonstrate that the motor - driven anti - correlated movements of actively - bonded nodes give an additional effective pair potential that exhibits a strong short - range attraction regardless of motor susceptibility .",
    "the original interaction is also still present but is an enhanced or weakened long - range attraction . for motors with negative susceptibility at sufficiently high activity",
    ", the dominant interaction is actually a long - range repulsion .",
    "the relative contributions of the various terms yield a diverse range of steady - state structures .",
    "this decoupling scheme in the mean - field spirit also allows us to perform a self - consistent calculation to evaluate quasi - thermodynamic phase diagrams .",
    "a non - monotonic dependence of the pressure ( or tension ) upon the node density ( under susceptible motor kicks ) indicates the possibility of phase separation .    to test the validity of the analytical approach ,",
    "we compare the steady - state structural features found by brownian dynamics simulations using the effective temperature and modified potential ( both a tensor - parameter formalism and a pair - level scalar - parameter formalism ) obtained from the steady - state solutions , with the structural features observed in a dynamic monte carlo simulation that is fully consistent with the master equation at thermal temperature and with bare interactions .",
    "we find good quantitative agreement suggesting that a non - equilibrium system driven by small - step correlated motor kicks can be thought of as being at an effective equilibrium with modified interactions .",
    "the existence of an effective short - range attraction combined with the predicted tendency for phase separation suggests that the formation of steady heterogeneous cluster structures is an example of arrested phase separation.@xcite a force - percolating network consisting of nonlinear elastic fibers attains rigidity when local collapse induced by the motor - driven short - range attraction balances the concomitant neighboring bond stretching .",
    "this initially homogeneous network then develops into dense clumps connected by highly stretched bonds , and simultaneously , compact aggregates phase separate from node - poor regions .",
    "the coarsening process stops once a global balance is achieved , and the pertinent dynamic process involves phase separation followed by arrest due to bond constraints .",
    "our model naturally explains the formation of aster patterns through the notion of an effective repulsion .",
    "in our earlier work @xcite we showed how an effective temperature describes steady - state fluctuations and responses of a model cytoskeleton , treated as an amorphous network of crosslinked nonlinear - elastic filaments , driven by _",

    ", the instability region ( shaded area ) expands toward lower @xmath144 and higher @xmath145 , suggesting that susceptible motors promote phase separation .",
    "since motor susceptibility affects only the long - range interaction via @xmath71 at high @xmath144 , where bond stretching stabilizes finite @xmath161 solutions , small or negative @xmath52 may lead to an effective repulsion that counteracts the trend of attraction thus eliminating the non - monotonicity in pressure , or else destabilizes @xmath161 solutions by offsetting the restoring force .",

    ", the monte carlo schemes explicitly incorporate pairwise anti - correlation by treating move pairs as reaction channels , while in the effective brownian dynamics schemes the total effective potential acting on individual nodes from all the neighbors smears out the pair correlation .",

    "[ pattern_diagram]b ) , however , correlation in motion plays a key role in structural development , because in this case an effective long - range repulsion dominates over the short - range attraction and governs the pattern formation .",

    "the tense bundles ( for non - percolating case ) and connected asters ( for percolating case ) are maintained as long - time steady state structures . at sufficiently high connectivity ,",
    "the bond constraints are too strong to allow significant local force asymmetry , thus a balanced tug - of - war between motor - attached filaments prevents the formation of heterogeneous cluster structures , and instead leads to a largely homogeneous structure with moderate fluctuations ( rightmost regime in both panels a and b ) , regardless of the motor susceptibility or correlation in motion .",
    "also we note that the brownian dynamics simulations for load - resisting motors exhibit similar behavior to that coming from uncorrelated isotropic kicks as we studied earlier @xcite : both simulations generate sustained aster patterns that do not collapse , exemplifying a negative effective temperature . for susceptible motors ,",
    "however , the dependence of @xmath71 and the effective attraction on the instantaneous local network structure hinders the system from achieving global concerted movement .",
    "there is thus no spontaneous flow or oscillating behavior that presents for the uncorrelated kick case.@xcite a similar absence of a flow transition has also been found for a contractile nematic model recently studied analytically @xcite and numerically.@xcite",
    "we are now in a position to recapitulate how the intricate interplay between local force generation , network connectivity and collective action of motors gives rise to regular and heterogeneous patterns , arrested coarsening and macroscopic contraction : a sufficient connectivity is required for forces to percolate so that local motor - induced stresses and resulting deformations can propagate significant distances through the network .",
    "given a force - percolating structure , downhill - prone motors yield heterogeneous / disordered cluster structures , exemplified as an arrested phase separation in the absence of bond or motor rupture events ; whereas load - resisting motors may drive large - scale contraction by surmounting a high energy barrier constituted by tense intermediates .",
    "anti - correlation in movements is essential for collapse of the intermediate tense states in approach to the eventual large - scale contraction ; in the absence of correlation in movements , as is the case for brownian dynamics simulations and for our earlier studies on uncorrelated kicks,@xcite the stretched bundles can not collapse and no contractile structures result , thus the aster pattern is maintained as the steady - state structure .",
    "the notion of effective interaction provides a natural explanation for the aggregation and coalescence of actomyosin condensates : enhanced long - range attraction facilitates initial density fluctuations ; effective attraction at short distances especially in the buckling regime , arising purely from motor - driven contractions , then promotes efficient aggregation by drawing nearby nodes or condensates even closer .",
    "whereas an effective repulsion can originate from a negative motor susceptibility , and in turn a negative effective temperature allows the formation of aster patterns in the absence of correlation in node movements",
    ".    our finding may suggest a new mechanism for aggregation of active gels : local force asymmetry and disorder ( structurally inherent or thermally generated ) trigger local aggregation which is further enhanced by an effective attraction due to correlated motor kicks ; force percolation combined with the tendency to reduce surface tension associated with the stretched bonds leads to coarsening of local aggregates ; when the balance between local bond collapse and neighboring bond stretching is reached , the system forms an arrested structure composed of floppy clumps connected by tense bonds .",
    "the pertinent dynamic process involves phase separation into node - rich and node - poor regions followed by arrest due to bond constraints .",
    "we also generalize the concept of effective temperature to non - equilibrium many - body systems driven by _ correlated _ small - step motor kicking events .",
