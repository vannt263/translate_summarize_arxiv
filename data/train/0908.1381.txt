    "in the currently favored picture of galactic structure formation , the milky way had a tumultuous early history . continuously bombarded from an early age by other galaxies big and small , the milky way has been roiled by mergers  a picture first put forth by @xcite .",
    "the fossil record of the milky way s history can be seen today in the debris left over from this cosmic carnage ",
    "the stellar streams that appear to be the shredded remains of galaxies past .",
    "the sdss has had a major impact in breaking open this field .",
    "a variety of photometric techniques have been developed to search through the large photometric database of the sdss to uncover these systems ( e.g. newberg et al .",
    "2002 , willman et al .",
    "2005 , belokurov et al .",
    "2006 , grillmair et al . 2006 ) .",
    "the primary search algorithms rely on a combination of correlations in position on the sky and position in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) . to date",
    ", a significant number of such structures have been located . however , the census of structures is still very far from complete , particularly at large galactocentric distances .",
    "the key issue is sensitivity : at very low intrinsic luminosities these objects can only be disentangled from foreground stars interior to @xmath250kpc and sdss star counts are only sensitive to surface brightnesses above @xmath3 mag / arcsec@xmath4 .",
    "a novel technique , first recognized by @xcite , to push the limits of finding substructure within the milky way is to make use of the photometric variability of rr lyrae stars .",
    "the repeated scans of sdss stripe-82 have allowed the discovery of milky way substructures via their populations of rr lyrae stars , which are standard candles , can be seen to large distances , and show distinctive light curves . the structure discussed in this _",
    "letter _ was first identified as an overdensity of rr lyrae stars by sesar et al .",
    "( 2007 ) as part of a larger study of all rr lyrae stars in stripe-82 .",
    "they termed this overdensity `` structure j '' , one among several such structures located . in a subsequent work ,",
    "watkins et al .",
    "( 2009 ) independently found what appears to be the same structure , which they termed the `` pisces overdensity '' .",
    "the photometric identification of these overdensities is a crucial first step in locating more streams and galaxies interior to the virial radius of the milky way .",
    "however , photometry provides two phase - space dimensions very accurately ( angular position ) and a third only very crudely ( distance ) . in order to show definitively whether photometric overdensities are , in fact , truly part of a common structure",
    "as opposed to a chance concentration , it is necessary to obtain data for additional phase - space dimension(s ) , which could in principle be either radial velocities or proper motions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this _",
    "letter _ , we report on the first results of a campaign to confirm distant structures in the milky way halo as defined by rr lyrae and giant stars .",
    "in figure  [ fig : structurej ] we show all of the identified rr lyrae stars in the apparent magnitude range @xmath5 that lie in sdss stripe-82 , which covers a @xmath6 stripe along the celestial equator .",
    "the positions and @xmath7 magnitudes of these objects come from the latest stripe-82 rr lyrae catalog @xcite .",
    "there is a very clear overdensity in the ra interval 335360 . with only about 30% of the stripe area , this sub - region contains 24 of the 31 rr lyrae stars ( 77% ) . for our first campaign we focused on the concentration located at ra@xmath8 and selected 8 objects near this overdensity based on their close 2d proximity and their similar median magnitudes .      obtaining a single - epoch spectrum for an rr lyrae star yields only a velocity of the stellar photosphere , which for these pulsating variables can deviate from the systemic velocity by several 10s of @xmath9 .",
    "however , the dense temporal sampling of stripe-82 enables us to obtain accurate ephemerides by phase folding the @xmath10 epochs in the sdss photometric archive .",
    "we can then correct velocity measurements made at known phase to the barycentric velocities for these stars ( joy 1938 ) .",
    "we extracted the lightcurves from the sdss archive and determined their periods based on a variant of the `` phase dispersion minimization '' technique @xcite .",
    "we first identified potential bad data points by performing a regression on @xmath11 vs.  @xmath12 flux , and flagging @xmath13 outliers ( as determined from the scatter  not the formal errors ) .",
    "while the colors of rr lyrae stars change during their pulsation cycle , the @xmath13 criterion allows an adequate range for normal color variation .",
    "we then removed near - achromatic points that were substantially fainter than the remaining points , which are probably due to some joint photometric anomaly , but in any case would not fit any rr lyrae - like light curve .",
    "finally , we varied the period and minimized the sum of the squares of the photometric differences between successive points .",
    "our derived @xmath11-band lightcurves for our 8 target objects are shown in figure  [ fig : lightcurves ] . in all but one case , periods derived from the @xmath11-band data were nearly identical to periods derived from the @xmath12-band data . based on these differences , we estimate the period error to be @xmath14day .",
    "interestingly , our derived periods are surprisingly similar , with a dispersion of only @xmath15 days .",
    "the objects are all rrab type variables and with median brightnesses of about g  @xmath2  20.5 these stars are at a distance of about 85  kpc .",
    "we have also estimated metallicities using the periods and amplitudes for the 8 stars using equation ( 6 ) of @xcite , assuming that the @xmath16-band amplitude is equal to the @xmath11-band amplitude .",
    "the metallicities range from [ fe / h]@xmath17 -1.3 to -2.1 .",
    "while these estimates are necessarily crude , we can conclude that all of the 8 stars are relatively metal - poor .",
    "the spectroscopic observations were obtained using the magellan echellette spectrograph ( mage ; marshall et al .",
    "2008 ) mounted on the 6.5-m clay telescope at las campanas observatory . in all cases",
    "two equal - length exposures bracketed an observation of a thar lamp .",
    "the data were reduced using a pipeline written by d. kelson following kelson ( 2003 ) .",
    "post - extraction processing of the spectra was done with the iraf echelle package .",
    "a 1-arcsec slit was used , resulting in a resolution of @xmath24100 , and the signal - to - noise ratio of the final spectra ranged from 7 to 16 per 0.36pixel at 4700 .",
    "exposure times varied from 3600s to 4000s depending on the observing conditions .",
    "velocities were measured with the iraf fxcor routine using a mage observation of the blue metal - poor star cs22874 - 009 ( @xmath18 = -36.6 @xmath19 , @xcite ) as the template .",
    "the cross correlations were made on the wavelength interval 4000  ",
    "5600  with the hydrogen lines masked out .",
    "we adopt the time - averaged velocity of the pulsation curve as the center - of - mass velocity of the star .",
    "integration of detailed velocity curves of the rra variables wy  ant , xz  aps , dt  hya , and rv  oct ( preston 2009 , in preparation ) shows that the pulsation velocity is equal to the star s time - average velocity at phase 0.37 , reckoned relative to maximum light .",
    "our observations were all made as close to this phase as possible , and velocity corrections were applied adopting @xmath20 @xmath19 per unit phase for the mean slope of the pulsation velocity curve at phase 0.37 for these four stars .",
    "a journal of the observations is presented in table 1 .",
    "column one lists the heliocentric julian date at mid - observation followed by the ra and dec of the star , the median @xmath11-band magnitude , the adopted pulsation period , the observed heliocentric velocity and the error as estimated from the fxcor measurement , the number of photometric datapoints in the lightcurve , the heliocentric julian date at maximum light ( zero phase ) , the pulsation phase at mid - observation , the velocity correction , and the final adopted heliocentric velocity .",
    "we were able to obtain accurate radial velocity measurements for 8 rr lyrae stars associated within the apparent pisces overdensity .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : velhist ] a histogram of the heliocentric radial velocities measured for our targets .",
    "there is a clear velocity peak , containing 5 of the 8 objects , at approximately @xmath21 .",
    "the other 3 stars also have an interesting velocity distribution to which we return later .",
    "figure  [ fig : targets ] shows our targets coded by velocity and magnitude .",
    "we also show in this figure other rr lyrae stars identified in the field @xcite fainter than @xmath22 . the spatial concentration at ( ra , dec)@xmath23 is suggestive of a coherent structure . however , our radial velocity measurements reveal a more nuanced picture",
    ". one of these objects ( cyan square ) has an apparent magnitude that puts it farther out in the halo than the rest of the concentration .",
    "the three central stars ( marked as triangles in the figure ) within this concentration have measured radial velocities - band and @xmath12-band period has a barycentric velocity of @xmath24 if the @xmath11-band period is adopted and @xmath25 if the @xmath12-band period is adopted . ]",
    "four stars in the central concentration and a fifth further away , however , have radial velocities that lie within the main velocity peak .",
    "we therefore seem to have two co - spatial velocity structures , one robustly identified in phase - space and one that is suggestive but too sparsely sampled at present to warrant detailed analysis .",
    "while few data exist at these distances in the stellar halo , a besanon model @xcite of the heliocentric velocity distribution at this position in the sky suggests that the expected velocity distribution of the smooth stellar halo is centered at @xmath27 with a dispersion of @xmath28 . in section",
    "[ sec : discuss ] , we focus exclusively on the main velocity peak .",
    "in order to determine the random chance that a grouping of 5 out of 8 stars could have velocities within 20@xmath19 of one another , we performed a monte carlo test by random samplings from a gaussian distribution with dispersion of @xmath29 .",
    "we find this probability to be less than 0.6% .",
    "this is a fair test ( and not an a posteriori justification of a curious velocity structure found serendipitously ) because this corresponds to exactly the velocity signature we were looking for when we undertook the observations .",
    "the group is therefore physically associated at high confidence in a fully bayesian sense .",
    "when looking at the spatial and kinematic information , the first question one must ask is whether these stars are part of a bound or unbound system , i.e. , is this an intruding galaxy , or the extended debris of a galaxy / star cluster ? while information on more stars ( e.g. giants and horizontal branch stars ) , would be important to address this question fully , some simple estimates are useful in providing guidance .",
    "if the system is assumed to be bound , we can estimate the mass using a virial estimator ( e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the velocity dispersion of the system , @xmath32 is the projected distance between each two stars . in order to measure the velocity dispersion we must account for the errors in our velocities .",
    "there are two main ( identifiable ) sources of velocity error .",
    "the primary source of uncertainty is the error due to the signal - to - noise ratio , which is reported in table 1 .",
    "a secondary source of uncertainty comes from our imprecise knowledge of the zero phase point due to the finite sampling of the stripe-82 data .",
    "this error is @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the number of data points in each light curve . for our data , this has a maximum value of @xmath35 and therefore does not affect our dispersions significantly .",
    "the phase errors induced by the period errors are similar .    assuming all 5 stars in the main velocity structure are part of the same physical structure , we obtain a velocity dispersion of @xmath36 which yields a mass of @xmath37 .",
    "a more conservative possibility is that only the  clump \" of four stars near ( ra , dec ) = @xmath38 is part of a bound structure , from which the star at @xmath39 either has been tidally stripped or is not physically associated with the main structure . in this case ,",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : one ] ) yields @xmath40 , whose @xmath41 range is not far from the typical value of @xmath42 for the mass interior to 300 pc found by @xcite for dwarfs with a wide range of luminosities .",
    "moreover , the apparent @xmath43 radius of the concentration corresponds to about 750 pc , rather than 300 pc , and this difference could account for the level of discrepancy in mass .",
    "hence , this structure is possibly virialized , and if so represents a new satellite of the milky way .",
    "given the small number of confirmed stars and the large physical size , however , we can not at this point rule out the possibility that it is being ( or has been ) tidally disrupted .    if the apparent structure is physical ( and not a chance superposition ) then whether it is bound or not , the presence of 4 rr lyrae stars within a @xmath44 rectangle implies that there must be a concentration of other stars within the system . by the fuel consumption theorem ,",
    "@xmath45 , the rr lyrae specific frequency ( the number per @xmath16-band luminosity , normalized to @xmath46 ; @xcite ) can be cast in terms of the fraction of he burning that takes place within rr lyrae stars , @xmath47 : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the atomic mass of @xmath50 , @xmath51 is the initial abundance of he , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is the difference in bolometric corrections between rr lyrae stars and typical giant stars .",
    "the highest observed value is @xmath55 @xcite , i.e. , @xmath56 .",
    "the surface brightness of the pisces concentration may be expressed as @xmath57 , and hence to be `` recognizable '' as a @xmath58 overdensity would require @xmath59 or @xmath60 .",
    "such systems do exist @xcite , but they are far from universal . we can not therefore , probe whether the pisces structure is a physical ( or chance ) association based on the presence ( or absence ) of an already known photometric counterpart in giants .",
    "deeper imaging data of this region as well as further spectroscopic follow - up of giant and horizontal branch stars in this region of the sky is necessary to confront this hypothesis .",
    "if the object is an unbound stream , as opposed to a bound system , we must ask whether this represents the disrupted remnant of a globular cluster system or the remnant of a satellite galaxy",
    ". robust characterization of streams and disrupting galaxies , both theoretically and observationally , is a challenge .",
    "the predicted phase - space morphology depends on a variety of initial conditions including initial mass , m / l ratio , stellar density profile and orbit parameters , and the observations are demanding and not always conducive to multiplexing due to the low density of targets . a thin physical extent transverse to the direction of motion on the sky ,",
    "uniform stellar color - magnitude diagram and narrow velocity dispersion would typically indicate a globular cluster stream as opposed to a galaxy stream .",
    "the large width of our structure suggests that if it is disrupting , it is a satellite galaxy as opposed to a globular cluster .",
    "the velocity dispersion is comparable to what is observed within the sagittarius stream @xcite or within the anticenter stream @xcite .    if the pisces overdensity is indeed a disrupted satellite it is interesting that located near the central core of this structure are three stars with similar velocities but offset from the main structure by nearly 100@xmath19 . as",
    "such large velocity offsets are not plausible simply by disruption effects alone , these stars are either a separate , perhaps bound , structure or they are random interlopers .",
    "the latter scenario is of little interest . in the former scenario it is intriguing , but perhaps not surprising , that we observe two overlapping streams at this position in the halo .",
    "more locally , the sagittarius system is so extensive and has made a sufficiently large number of orbits that many objects have been found within it ( e.g. segue 1 ) that can only be disentangled using velocity and metallicity information .",
    "farther out in the galaxy , bell et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have determined that at least 50% of the stellar density is in a clumpy form .",
    "detailed comparison with cosmologically - motivated models for the spaghetti - like nature of the halo would be useful in determining whether such self - overlapping systems are rare or commonplace in the milky way at these distances .",
    "we present spectroscopic confirmation of the photometric overdensity observed in rr lyrae stars toward the constellation pisces .",
    "we suggest that this system is a dwarf galaxy  possibly in the process of disruption , possibly already disrupted , or possibly bound with very low surface brightness .",
    "the nature of the stellar halo at distances of @xmath61 is still relatively uncharted territory .",
    "using rr lyrae stars to explore this regime of phase space is a novel and exciting way forward .",
    "large photometric datasets such as those provided by sdss and similar experiments in conjunction with large ground - based telescopes to obtain spectra should yield important insight into the nature of the milky way s perhaps troubled , perhaps tranquil past .",
