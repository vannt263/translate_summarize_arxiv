    "although the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) [ 1 - 5 ] is the simplest version among the supersymmetric extensions of the standard model ( sm ) , with just two higgs doublets , there are some arguments that it should be extended [ 6 ] .",
    "one of the motivations to extend the mssm may be the fine - tuning problem , which states that the radiative corrections to the tree - level mass of the lightest scalar higgs boson in the mssm should be large enough to be consistent with the experimental lower bound on the higgs boson mass at lep2 , around 114 gev .",
    "if the radiative corrections are not large enough , the lightest scalar higgs boson in the mssm might face the difficulty of incompatibility with experiments .    in the next - to - mssm [ 7 - 10 ] , where an additional higgs singlet is introduced to the mssm",
    ", the fine - tuning problem may be alleviated by the contributions from the higgs singlet .",
    "the presence of the higgs singlet increases the upper bound on the tree - level mass of the lightest scalar higgs boson in the next - to - mssm up to about 115 gev , and thus the radiative corrections need not be large enough to be consistent with lep2 data [ 11 - 38 ] .",
    "the burden of the fine tuning in the mssm might also be reduced by adding extra quarks , such as the sequential quarks or the vector - like quarks .",
    "if the additional quarks are those of the fourth generation , with masses at about 400 gev , it has been shown that the mass of the lightest scalar higgs boson in the mssm might increase up to 400 gev [ 39 ] .",
    "if the additional quarks are vector - like quarks , as proposed about two decades ago by moroi and okada [ 40,41 ] , the fine tuning problem might be solved by the radiative corrections due to the contributions from the vector - like quarks and the vector - like scalar quarks .",
    "the vector - like quarks and their superpartners increase the mass of the lightest scalar higgs boson well above the lep2 bound , without requiring a large susy breaking scale as 2 tev [ 40 - 46 ] .    recently , in the extension of the mssm with vector - like quarks , martin has investigated the one - loop corrections to the mass of the lightest scalar higgs boson [ 46 ] . he has shown that the radiative corrections due to the vector - like quarks and vector - like scalar quarks may be as large as about 55 gev , if the mass of the lightest scalar higgs boson before correction is 110 gev . his result has been obtained by neglecting some soft susy breaking parameters to simplify the @xmath0 mass matrix of the vector - like scalar quarks into two @xmath1 submatrices , and assuming that the weak eigenstates and the mass eigenstates of the vector - like quarks are identical .    in this article",
    ", we show that the one - loop mass of the lightest scalar higgs boson may be even as large as 280 gev if we carry out the calculations without the above simplifications assumed in ref . [",
    "46 ] , by taking into account the contributions from top quark and vector - like quarks and their scalar superpartners at the one - loop level .",
    "the masses of the vector - like quarks are assumed to lie in the range of 300 gev to 550 gev , and the masses of the vector - like scalar quarks in the range of 200 gev to 910 gev .",
    "the lower bound on the mass of the lightest scalar higgs boson in this model is determined such that it should not have been discovered at lep2 with a mass smaller than its lower bound . the negative experimental result for the higgs search at lep2 set the lower bound on the mass of the lightest scalar higgs boson as 85 gev .",
    "we may note that , since the mass of the lightest scalar higgs boson can be sufficiently large , there are wide regions in the parameter space of the extensions of the mssm with vector - like quarks which shall be examined by the higgs search in future high - energy collider experiments .",
    "martin have investigated several versions of extensions of the mssm with the vector - like matters in ref . [ 46 ] . to be specific",
    ", we study the que model among them , where three vector - like chiral fields are introduced to the mssm .",
    "these vector - like fields transform under @xmath2 as @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are the vector - like quark fields , while @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the vector - like lepton fields . in terms of physical particles , this model has , in addition to the sm quarks and leptons , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , quarks with charge @xmath12 , @xmath13 , a quark with charge @xmath14 , and a charged lepton @xmath15 , together with their scalar partners @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) , @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , and @xmath20 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the superpotential of our model may be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 are the soft susy breaking masses of the vector - like sector , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are yukawa coupling coefficients to the higgs fields @xmath27 and @xmath28 , with the weak hypercharge @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "the tree - level higgs potential of our model is the same as the higgs potential of the mssm at the tree level .",
    "it is given as @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are the mass parameters , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are two higgs doublets , and @xmath37 and @xmath38 are respectively the gauge coupling coefficients for @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "there are two neutral scalar higgs bosons and a neutral pseudoscalar higgs bosons in the mssm .",
    "the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) developed by two neutral scalar higgs bosons are denoted as @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and their ratio is repesented by @xmath43 . in this article",
    ", we would not consider the cp mixing between the scalar and pseudoscalar higgs bosons .",
    "thus , the vacuum expectation values of the neutral higgs fields as well as the parameters of the higgs potential are all real .",
    "two mass parameters @xmath33 and @xmath32 can be eliminated by the minimum equations with respect to the scalar higgs fields .",
    "thus , just two paramaters , @xmath34 and @xmath44 , describe the tree - level masses of the scalar higgs bosons .",
    "they are given by the eigenvalues of the tree - level @xmath1 mass matrix , @xmath45 , for the scalar higgs bosons .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath45 are given explicitly as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the squared mass of @xmath48 boson , with @xmath49 gev .",
    "note that the tree - level mass of the lightest scalar higgs boson is smaller than @xmath48 boson mass .    in order to study the radiative corrections to the tree - level higgs boson mass",
    ", we evaluate the higgs potential at the one - loop level .",
    "the one - loop effective potential is given by the effective pottential approximation as [ 47 ] @xmath50   \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the renormalization scale in the modified minimal subtraction scheme , @xmath52 are the field - dependent masses of quarks and scalar quarks , and @xmath53 are the degrees of freedom arising from color , charge , and spin factors of the particles in the loops , hence , @xmath54 for quarks and @xmath55 for scalar quarks .",
    "we take into account top quark , vector - like quarks and their scalar superpartners , as their contributions are significant for the mass of the lightest scalar higgs boson at the one - loop level in our analysis .",
    "the full higgs potential at the one - loop level is thus @xmath56    the masses of the scalar top quarks after electroweak symmetry breaking may be expressed as @xmath57 with @xmath58 ^ 2 + m_t^2 \\bigg ( a_t - \\mu \\cot \\beta \\bigg)^2 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are soft susy breaking masses , @xmath61 is the mass of top quark , with @xmath62 being the yukawa coupling coefficient for top quark , @xmath63 is the trilinear susy breaking mass parameter , and @xmath64 is a parameter with mass dimension .",
    "note that @xmath65 represents the mixing between the left - handed and the right - handed scalar top quarks .",
    "next , let us study the vector - like sector of our model .",
    "we adapt the notation of re .",
    "the mass matrix for the vector - like quarks at the tree level is given by @xmath66 with @xmath67 the squared masses of the two vector - like quarks , @xmath68 ( @xmath19 ) , are given by the doubly degenerate eigenvalues of @xmath69 .",
    "the mass matrix of the vector - like scalar quarks is given by @xmath70    where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the soft susy breaking parameters with mass - square dimension , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the soft susy breaking masses and @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the trilinear mass parameters .",
    "we assume that they are all real and yield real eigenvalues .",
    "we note that , unlike ref . [",

    "[ 46 ] .",
    "now , we apply the above formulae for the tree - level masses of top quark , vector - like quarks , and their scalar superpartners into the one - loop effective higgs potential in order to evaluate their contributions to the mass of the lightest scalar higgs boson .",

    "for the top quark mass , we take 171 gev and assume that it is smaller than the masses of the scalar top quarks .",
    "it is obtained that the masses of the vector - like quarks lies in the range of 300 gev to 550 gev , and the masses of the vector - like scalar quarks in the range of 200 gev to 910 gev .",
