    "neutrino oscillation experiments involving neutrinos and antineutrinos coming from astrophysical and terrestrial sources @xcite have found compelling evidence that neutrinos have mass . to accommodate this observation , the minimal standard model ( sm ) must be extended . some sensible ways to do this include : ( a ) type i seesaw with three heavy right - handed ( rh ) majorana neutrinos @xcite , ( b ) the use of an electroweak higgs triplet to directly provide the left - handed ( lh ) neutrinos with small majorana masses ( type ii seesaw @xcite ) , ( c ) introducing a fermion triplet ( type iii seesaw @xcite ) , ( d ) the generation of three dirac neutrinos through an exact parallel of the sm method of giving mass to charged fermions , and ( e ) the radiative generation of neutrino masses as per the zee or babu models @xcite . but in the absence of more experimental data ,",
    "it is impossible to tell which , if any , of these is actually correct .",
    "the focus of this paper is on method ( a ) , the seesaw framework with three heavy rh majorana neutrinos ( denoted @xmath1 throughout ) .",
    "it is an attractive possibility because it simply posits the existence of these @xmath1 s to parallel the multiplet structure of the other fermions while providing a simple explanation for why the light neutrinos are so much less massive than the charged leptons .",
    "since the setup uses the most general renormalisable lagrangian consistent with the sm gauge symmetry , both the yukawa couplings of the lh leptons to the rh neutrinos and bare majorana masses are permitted for the rh neutrinos .",
    "consequently , the additional assumption that the rh majorana mass scale is much higher than that of the charged fermions leads to a tiny mass for ordinary neutrinos through the famous seesaw relation : @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the majorana mass for a light neutrino and @xmath4 is a large rh majorana mass ( @xmath5 ) with @xmath6 being most naturally of the order of a charged fermion mass .",
    "the three light neutrino mass eigenstates are accompanied by three heavy neutral lepton mass eigenstates .",
    "depending on the parameter space for the rh neutrino bare masses and yukawa couplings , additional benefits may flow : thermal leptogenesis @xcite if there are appropriate @xmath0-violating decays and if the lightest of the heavy @xmath1 s has mass greater than about @xmath7 gev @xcite ; leptogenesis through @xmath0-violating oscillations of the @xmath1 s as in the akhmedov - rubakov - smirnov mechanism @xcite ; or @xmath1 s as a warm dark matter candidate @xcite .    since the mass eigenstate heavy neutral leptons are to a good approximation sterile with respect to gauge interactions , they are difficult to detect experimentally .",
    "this is especially true if they are also extremely massive , as in the thermal leptogenesis alternative . on the other hand ,",
    "if they are not as massive and are in the tev scale , then they can be looked for in colliders through their yukawa interactions , and through their suppressed but nonzero weak interactions ( induced through the mass mixing with regular active neutrinos ) .    to experimentally test the seesaw scenario",
    ", it would be helpful if one knew the parameters governing the @xmath1-sector including their interactions with other sm particles . in the minimal seesaw model , these parameters are arbitrary , so one has to go beyond the minimal model to achieve this goal .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to illustrate how symmetries may be used to determine the rh majorana mass matrix as a function of low - energy mass , mixing angle and @xmath0-violating phase observables by constructing several representative models .",
    "we then examine these models to see if thermal leptogenesis can succeed or if experimentally accessible heavy @xmath1 s are predicted .    in the next section",
    "we discuss the general model building symmetry requirements for relating the @xmath1-sector parameters to low - energy observables .",
    "section [ sec : symmetry - basics ] then revises the basic properties of the identified symmetries , followed by sec .",

    "the effective light majorana neutrino mass matrix @xmath3 , defined through @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the neutrino dirac mass matrix , defined through @xmath11 whilst the rh majorana mass matrix @xmath4 is defined through @xmath12 let @xmath13 be the mass - eigenstates for the light majorana neutrinos , where @xmath14 is the unitary diagonalization matrix for @xmath3 .",
    "the diagonalized @xmath3 is therefore @xmath15 eq.([eq : ml ] ) then implies that @xmath16 the matrix @xmath17 has been experimentally determined up to an absolute light neutrino mass scale , which we shall conveniently parameterize through the lightest @xmath3 eigenvalue . for the normal hierarchy ( nh ) with @xmath18 , we have ( for @xmath19 ) @xmath20 where @xmath21 ev@xmath22 and @xmath23 ev@xmath22 are the `` solar '' and `` atmospheric '' squared - mass difference respectively @xcite . for the inverted hierarchy ( ih ) with @xmath24",
    ", we obtain @xmath25 in order to connect the high- and low - energy sectors , one must have @xmath4 completely determined by known quantities .",
    "hence , our goal is to have @xmath4 constructed from some combination of @xmath17 , the charged - fermion mass matrices , @xmath26 with @xmath27 , and the lepton and quark mixing matrices ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) respectively . as a consequence , the first necessary condition , according to eq.([eq : ml2 ] ) , is : @xmath30 the simplest possibility is that @xmath31 there are custodial @xmath32 , unification and quark - lepton symmetries that can enforce each of these conditions at tree - level , as we shall review in the next section . for the moment ,",
    "let us just accept that they are all possible . equation ( [ eq : ml2 ] ) now becomes @xmath33 introducing the diagonalized fermion mass matrix @xmath34 where the @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the left- and right - diagonalization matrices for @xmath6 respectively , eq.([eq : ml3 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath37 which in turn reveals the second necessary condition : @xmath38 because the known weak interactions are left - handed , the right - diagonalization matrix can not be measured . therefore , to satisfy condition ( [ eq : cond2 ] ) , @xmath36 needs to be determined by the theory , and this usually means a _ flavor symmetry _ is required . in the next section",
    "we shall review how flavor symmetries can give rise to fully determined diagonalization matrices , where their entries are just numbers , usually related to the clebsch - gordan coefficients of the flavor symmetry group .",
    "the product @xmath39 is similar in form to both the pmns and ckm matrices , which are , respectively , @xmath40 the simplest ansatze are that @xmath41 equals either @xmath28 or @xmath29 .",
    "the next simplest class would see @xmath39 equal to a product of either the pmns or ckm matrix and a known matrix predicted by the flavor symmetry selected .",
    "let us consider some special cases .",
    "the simplest possibility suggested by the above equations would be that @xmath42 these relations may be achieved by imposing a @xmath43 and flavor symmetry respectively .",
    "the rh majorana mass matrix is then completely determined through @xmath44 two other possibilities , arising from the enforcement of ( @xmath45 ) and the appropriate flavor symmetries , are that @xmath46 leading to @xmath47 because of the automatic presence of @xmath14 in the formula for @xmath4 , it is relatively straightforward to find symmetries leading to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mr_e_pmns ] ) and ( [ eq : mr_ud_pmns ] ) where the leptonic pmns mixing matrix is a key feature .",
    "but it may also be of interest to consider symmetry structures that can lead to the pmns matrix being replaced by the ckm matrix ( or a product of the two ) .",
    "one way to try this would be to arrange symmetries such that @xmath3 would be necessarily diagonal , giving @xmath48 .",
    "then , the condition @xmath49 , together with @xmath50 , will lead to @xmath51 , and hence the relation @xmath52 would be obtained . a similar relation with @xmath53 and @xmath54 interchanging roles",
    "could equally well be contemplated .",
    "the delicate part would be obtaining a diagonal @xmath3 without forcing a diagonal @xmath10 .",
    "if the latter were diagonal , then the relations @xmath55 or @xmath56 would also imply that @xmath57 or respectively @xmath58 , and hence leading to @xmath59 at tree - level .",
    "finally , there is of course the relatively mundane case where all of the diagonalization matrices in the formula for @xmath4 are equal to the identity , so that one simply gets @xmath60 interestingly , this is not possible for the @xmath61 choice , because the pmns matrix is known to be very dissimilar to the identity .",
    "however , flavor symmetries allowing , eq.([eq : mundane ] ) can in principle be achieved for @xmath62 or @xmath54 . in these situations , one would then get @xmath63 and @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "although the analysis above was framed in terms of the leading seesaw expression @xmath66 , it generalizes to cases where additional terms on the right - hand side are kept , because the higher - order terms contain _ a priori _ the same unknowns as does the leading term .    in summary ,",
    "the general properties of enforcing a ( @xmath67 ) symmetry in parallel with some flavor symmetries motivate relations of the form @xmath68 of which eqs.([eq : mr_e_pmns ] ) , ( [ eq : mr_ud_pmns ] ) , ( [ eq : mr_d_ckm ] ) and ( [ eq : mundane ] ) are important examples .",
    "the aim of this section is to briefly illustrate how mass relations of the type @xmath69 may be enforced , as well as the role of flavor symmetry in determining the diagonalization matrices of interest .",
    "we will present some concrete examples that utilize these ideas to good effect in the next section .",
    "it is well known that in a minimal @xmath70 framework one obtains the mass relations @xmath71 , because all fermions are in the same multiplet and the electroweak higgs lies in a real fundamental of @xmath70 .",
    "these relations are too powerful from a phenomenological perspective : while the neutrino dirac mass matrix is related to that of another fermion as desired , the other mass relations @xmath72 are _ not _ wanted .",
    "however , this observation motivates the search for gauge groups that contain the sm as a subgroup and have enough power to establish the mass relation we seek without violating any known experimental constraints .",
    "indeed , subgroups of @xmath70 are good starting points for such a search . outside of @xmath70 ,",
    "the use of discrete rather than continuous symmetries to relate different multiplets constitutes another sensible strategy .",
    "let us consider the following groups , motivated by being subgroups of @xmath70 , but not necessarily to be thought of as arising from an underlying @xmath70 theory : the standard @xmath73 unification group @xcite , its flipped extension @xmath74 @xcite and the left - right group @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "standard @xmath73 has the lh charged leptons and lh down antiquarks in the @xmath76 representation , while their mass partners are in the @xmath77 . in the minimal model a single yukawa term couples those two multiplets to a higgs in the @xmath76 , leading to the relation @xmath78 .",
    "the up - quark and neutrino dirac masses are governed by independent yukawa couplings , so they are unrelated to each other and unrelated to @xmath79 and @xmath80 . in flipped @xmath73 , the down antiquarks and",
    "the up antiquarks flip roles , as also do the charged antileptons and antineutrinos .",
    "the minimal model thus supplies @xmath56 with unrelated @xmath80 and @xmath79 entries . for our purposes ,",
    "standard @xmath73 is not useful , but flipped @xmath73 is interesting can also be used to enforce @xmath56 ] .",
    "the third subgroup , the left - right group , has the power to enforce mass degeneracy between weak isospin partners : @xmath82 and @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "such a degeneracy follows from requiring a bidoublet higgs to be _ real _ , which at the @xmath70 level follows from having the higgs 10-plet being real .",
    "this basically causes @xmath84 to become custodial @xmath32 .",
    "so we conclude that flipped @xmath73 which can give @xmath56 and the left - right group which can give @xmath85 are relevant @xmath70 subgroups for our purposes .",
    "the other obvious mass relation @xmath55 will be obtained in the next section not from @xmath70 or any of its subgroups , but rather by using the idea of discrete quark - lepton symmetry @xcite .",
    "the idea here is to extend the gauge group by including an @xmath86 color group for leptons , with standard leptons identified as one of the colours after spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "the gauge structure now permits a discrete interchange symmetry between quarks and ( generalized ) leptons to be imposed , from which @xmath55 can follow .",
    "though we shall not pursue this line of thought further in this paper , we should also remark that the relation between @xmath10 and @xmath87 need not be a direct equality . at the @xmath70 level one can consider embedding the electroweak higgs doublet not in the @xmath77 but in a higher - dimensional representation .",
    "in that case a matrix of clebsch - gordan coefficients relates @xmath10 with the other fermion mass matrix , as a generalization of the well - known georgi - jarlskog @xcite modification of the @xmath79 to @xmath80 relation in @xmath73 unification .    once the appropriate fermion - mass - constraining group is selected , the remaining challenges are twofold .",
    "the first , as well - illustrated by minimal @xmath70 , is the removal of byproducts such as unwanted mass relations or interactions .",
    "the second is the need to have predictable diagonalization matrices .",
    "quite frequently , it is possible to meet both of these challenges by introducing a _ flavor symmetry _ and a non - minimal higgs sector . in cases where this is not sufficient , unbroken global non - flavor symmetries may be imposed to eliminate all undesirable terms .",
    "the key concept is that of a `` form - diagonalizable matrix '' @xcite . this is a matrix containing relations amongst its elements and",
    "perhaps also texture zeros so as to make the diagonalization matrices fully determined while leaving the eigenvalues arbitrary .",
    "special flavor symmetries exist to enforce form - diagonalizability , and they have in recent years been widely used to try to understand the `` tribimaximal '' form @xcite that is consistent with the experimentally measured pmns matrix .    in the models presented below , combined effect of the mass - relating symmetry and the flavor symmetry will be to produce a relation of the form @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is given by a known diagonalization matrix .",
    "in this section , we construct three realistic models that can enforce @xmath88 , and subsequently lead to relations ( [ eq : mr_e_pmns ] ) and ( [ eq : mr_ud_pmns ] ) respectively .",
    "we consider a flipped @xmath73 group @xcite augmented by @xmath91 flavor symmetry @xcite : @xmath92 with hypercharge @xmath93 given by a linear combination of @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the choice of this gauge group is for the reason discussed in the previous section : one naturally obtains the useful mass relation @xmath56 while avoiding @xmath78 .",
    "the role of the flavor symmetry is then purely to ensure that all diagonalization matrices are completely determined .    for this model ,",
    "the particle contents and their transformation properties under @xmath96 are given by : @xmath97 where the superscripts 1,2 and 3 and greek letters are the color and @xmath73 indices respectively . in matrix form",
    ", the @xmath96 invariant interaction lagrangian then contains the following terms : @xmath98 note that @xmath99 , which provides the heavy majorana mass , breaks @xmath96 down to the sm , and is expected to be at a much higher energy scale than @xmath100 which breaks electroweak symmetry .    writing out the @xmath91 structure of the @xmath101- and @xmath102-terms in eq .",

    "( [ eq : su5_lag2 ] ) , if we expand the @xmath111- and @xmath112-term in flavor space , it becomes apparent that the @xmath53-quark mass matrix , @xmath80 , and the rh majorana mass matrix , @xmath4 , are both arbitrary complex symmetric matrices .",
    "consequently , the diagonalization matrices @xmath113 and @xmath114 ( since @xmath3 is a function of @xmath4 ) are both arbitrary unitary matrices in this model .",
    "this implies that the model places no restrictions on the neutrino mixing matrix , @xmath115 , and the quark mixing matrix , @xmath116 , and so one simply sets them to match the experimental values .",
    "next , we construct a slightly more complicated model within the framework of a discrete quark - lepton symmetry @xcite . as well as the usual @xmath91 flavor symmetry , we also introduce an additional unbroken @xmath118 global symmetry to forbid certain interaction terms in the lagrangian .",

    "first of all , from the fact that @xmath248 is typically in the range of @xmath249 gev for all setups , it is clear that conventional leptogenesis where the asymmetry is generated predominantly by the decays of @xmath250 s would not be successful @xcite .",
    "however , there exist other special solutions to the leptogenesis scenario .    as was pointed out earlier , the tall spikes in the plots of figs .",
    "[ fig : mu_m123 ] and [ fig : md_me_m12 ] indicate that there are regions in the parameter space for these models where @xmath251 and @xmath252 become almost degenerate .",
    "consequently , it has been shown in @xcite that a sufficient baryon asymmetry can be generated from resonant enhancement @xcite to the raw @xmath0 asymmetry in the decays of @xmath250 s .",
    "furthermore , a similar enhancement to the decay of the next - to - the - lightest rh neutrino @xmath253 , when @xmath252 and @xmath254 become degenerate , can also produce the desired asymmetry in principle , as long as washout effects mediated by the lighter @xmath250 s are insufficient @xcite .",
    "another interesting observation is that , recently , ref .",
    "@xcite discussed the possibility of successful leptogenesis ( without the need for resonant enhancement ) in models with @xmath70-inspired mass relations which have properties similar to those presented here ( see also @xcite ) . in the analysis of @xcite",
    ", they explored the situation where the asymmetry is first generated by @xmath253 decays at a temperature where flavor effects @xcite are important .",
    "specifically , the relevant range of @xmath255  gev leads to a two - flavor regime where the lepton asymmetry will be stored in the @xmath256-component , as well as a coherent superposition of @xmath257-components .",
    "subsequently , flavor dependent washout effects coming from interactions with @xmath250 s may not completely erase all components of the asymmetry generated by the @xmath253 s .",
    "one central conclusion in @xcite is that , for this mechanism to generate enough asymmetry , the mass of the next - to - the - lightest rh neutrino must be about @xmath258  gev .    inspecting the @xmath252-plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : mu_m123 ] ( corresponding to the @xmath259 case ) , we can see that the condition of @xmath258  gev can be marginally met by a small region of the parameter space ( near the various spikes in the region where @xmath197 is between @xmath260 to @xmath261  ev ) , whereas the @xmath262 cases are definitely ruled out for this scenario due to the smallness of @xmath252 .",
    "therefore , it appears that for some special values of @xmath197 with certain sets of phases @xmath263 , leptogenesis via @xmath253 decays taking into account the effects of flavor is also possible ( for the @xmath259 model ) in addition to resonant leptogenesis .",
    "moreover , if this picture of flavored @xmath253-leptogenesis is indeed the mechansim responsible for generating the baryon asymmetry of the universe , then the corresponding sets of low energy phases in our model @xmath263 which make this possible will generally lead to modifications of the neutrinoless double beta decay rate through the quantity @xcite @xmath264 for example , taking @xmath265  ev and assuming normal hierarchy , the phases implied by @xmath253-leptogenesis will lead to @xmath266  ev , which is a noticeable reduction from 0.070  ev in cases where both majorana phases are turned off .",
    "ev in this discussion is because so far we have not found any set of phases for @xmath267 in which @xmath253-leptogenesis is actually viable .",
    "] however , present experimental upper limits on @xmath268 lie somewhere between 0.16 and 0.68  ev @xcite , and so it is difficult to distinguish such differences .",
    "the detection of this may only be possible in future experiments such as cuore @xcite and gerda @xcite which have a projected sensitivity down to about 0.05  ev .    in summary",
    ", while the models presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : models ] do not generically lead to successful baryon asymmetry generation via thermal leptogenesis , some fine - tuned special cases do exist .",
    "it is possible that the enlargement of the workable parameter space for leptogenesis can result from modifications to the higgs sector of these models , but such analyses are beyond the scope of this work .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the model with @xmath269 , the lightest heavy majorana neutrino mass @xmath248 can be about 1 tev making one wonder if it is possible to see signals of such a particle at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) and or a future international linear collider ( ilc ) .",
    "however , since the heavy majorana neutrinos are dominantly right - handed singlets which do not have gauge interactions , the interactions of the heavy neutral leptons with sm gauge bosons arise through their mixing between light neutrinos .",
    "the interaction lagrangians are parameterized through mixing angles @xmath270 ( @xmath271 ) of order @xmath272 as per @xmath273 where @xmath274 .    with these interactions ,",
    "it is possible to produce signals for heavy neutral leptons through @xmath275 followed by @xmath276 or @xmath277 .",
    "the production of @xmath1 by @xmath278 is much harder to study due to large backgrounds .",
    "however , in a model - independent study in ref .",
    "@xcite , such a mechanism was found to lead to a detectable heavy neutral lepton signal only if the mass is of order 100 gev or less , for the initial stage of lhc running with luminosity of order 10 @xmath279 . besides",
    ", the amplitudes of @xmath270 in our models are far too small . even assuming @xmath280  ev which will saturate the bound of ( [ eq : nu_mass_limit ] ) and in the best case scenario with inverted hierarchy and special choice of phases , one obtains @xmath281 ( with @xmath282  gev ) which is much less than the minimum required to produce an observable signal in any of the channels @xcite .",
    "the suppression is even greater for the @xmath283 or @xmath256 flavor . as a result",
    ", it is very difficult to detect the heavy neutral leptons through this mechanism even with an integrated luminosity up to 300 @xmath279 .",
    "if there is only one higgs doublet , there is also a light neutrino and heavy neutral lepton interaction with the higgs particle given by @xmath284 this interaction , although not of much help in the production of heavy neutral leptons through @xmath285 , does provide another channel for @xmath1 decay .",
    "if the higgs mass is not too much larger than the w boson mass , the decay rate is similar to that for @xmath286 or @xmath277 .    in the models we are considering ,",
    "there are several higgs doublets .",
    "the neutral higgs couplings to light neutrinos and heavy neutral leptons are then not necessarily proportional to @xmath287 and can increase the decay rate . also , in our models there are charged higgs bosons interacting with light neutrinos and heavy neutral leptons which also provide additional channels for detection of the @xmath1 s . but given the smallness of the mixing @xmath270 mentioned above , it is still very difficult to detect a heavy neutral lepton with mass of order 1 tev at the lhc even with 300 @xmath279 of luminosity .",
    "charged - higgs couplings to charged - leptons and heavy neutral leptons may have interesting signals at an ilc through @xmath288 with t - channel heavy higgs exchange , and @xmath289 with u - channel @xmath1 exchange @xcite .",
    "in particular the processes @xmath289 , are very sensitive the heavy neutral lepton mass .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that if @xmath290 is in the range of @xmath291 to @xmath292 , the ilc with an energy of 500 gev can probe heavy neutral lepton masses up to @xmath293 tev . in our case , the charged - higgs coupling to charged - leptons and heavy neutral leptons can be larger than @xmath294 , but still too small to be probed using the processes mentioned above .",
    "the main point of this paper was to demonstrate through general arguments backed up by explicit models that symmetries can be used to connect the rh majorana neutrino mass matrix to low - energy observables such as charged - fermion masses , mixing angles and @xmath0-violating phases .",
    "if a model of this type were to actually describe nature , then the benefit would be that the high - mass seesaw sector would be completely determined from low - energy observations , improving the predictability and testability of the seesaw neutrino mass generation mechanism . since this mechanism can also be used to understand the cosmological matter - antimatter asymmetry through leptogenesis , such constrained models are also important for cosmology .",
    "we focused on the simplest models of this type , which yielded @xmath295 where @xmath27 .",
    "our phenomenological analysis showed that successful leptogenesis is possible for the @xmath296 case in certain fine - tuned corners of parameter space .",
    "we also noted that the @xmath297 case can also supply a heavy neutral lepton with a mass of about 1 tev , opening the prospect for collider detection , though detailed analysis showed that this mass is still too large to plausibly expect detection at either the lhc or a future ilc .",
    "future work in this are could explore a possible role for the ckm matrix rather than the more obvious pmns matrix in the formula for @xmath4 . also , the use of clebsch - gordan coefficients to generalize the relationship between the neutrino dirac mass matrix and @xmath26 away from being a strict equality is another obvious line of investigation . finally , our explicit models used flavor symmetry to render the right - handed diagonalization matrices to be simply identity matrices .",
    "it could also be of interest to loosen this constraint .",

    "<S> the model where the neutrino dirac mass matrix equals the charged - lepton mass matrix can yield a heavy neutral lepton as light as about 1 tev , but detecting such a particle will be difficult . </S>"
