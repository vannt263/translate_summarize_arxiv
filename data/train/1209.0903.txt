    "@xmath87 on the other hand , a lower bound for the wavelength is given by the energy resolution of the detector .",
    "the resolution of the detector must be sufficient to resolve the oscillation in the spectrum .",
    "we assume that the frequency resolution limit is given by @xmath88 with the typical value of @xmath89 being @xmath90 .",
    "then , we obtain the following inequality as another necessary condition : @xmath91 eventually , we find @xmath92 this implies that only a narrow range of wavelength , with the fractional width of order @xmath89 , is usable in probing a given configuration of the lens system .",

    "correspondingly , the detectable energy scale of the string tension is estimated as @xmath99 where we have assumed @xmath100 .    in reality",

    "then the detectable range of the deficit angle is found to be @xmath102      so far , it has been assumed that a grb can be treated as a point source .",

    "the upper limit for the source radius can be estimated by considering the @xmath69 dependence of the amplification factor . for a fixed value of @xmath68 , the square of the amplification factor oscillates with the period @xmath103 as a function of @xmath69 .",

    "@xcite for the point mass case ) .      in the previous discussions ,",
    "we have assumed a static configuration of the lens system .",

    "only a limited number of bright burst events would be usable to detect femto - lensing events .",
    "this demand might be compared to those in the case of compact objects , which are believed to have a non - relativistic velocity dispersion .",
    "finally , we estimate how many strings in between the source and the observer are necessary in order that femto - lensing events can actually take place for a given number of grbs . here",

    "still , those spikes may not individually contain enough photons to provide a clear spectrum ; then we would need to collect a bunch of spikes .",
    "let @xmath132 denote the mean number of such qualifying bunches within one grb .",
    "then , the event probability @xmath124 for a single grb has to be multiplied by the factor @xmath132 .",
    "assuming @xmath133 and @xmath134 , we can expect roughly one femto - lensing event among 100 available gamma - ray burst events .",
    "this roughly corresponds to one detection per year with fermi satellite if most of the observed gamma - ray bursts can be used for the femto - lensing search .",
    "even if we do not observe such an event , we may obtain an observational limit on @xmath135 .",
    "further detailed analysis of grb spectra is needed for a more precise estimation of the event rate and giving observational limits on @xmath135 .",
    "cosmic strings are not the only candidates for a femto - lensing object , as point masses would also cause a similar effect .",
    "it is necessary to study the differences between these two cases in order to determine how they can be distinguished observationally .",
    "below , we shall review the femto - lensing caused by a point mass and highlight the difference between this and the case of a string .",
    "let us consider the point mass lens system with distances from the observer to a lens @xmath136 , from the lens to a source @xmath137 and the observer to the source @xmath138 .",
    "let @xmath139 denote the distance between the source position and the intersection of the source plane and the line which connects the observer and the lens .",
    "for the point mass case , we have the following expression for the amplification factor  @xcite : @xmath140 where @xmath110 and @xmath141 are the gamma function and the confluent hyper - geometric function , respectively , and @xmath142    considering the @xmath143 case , we can find the following expressions for the path difference @xmath144 and half of the separation angle @xmath145 : @xmath146 these @xmath144 and @xmath145 correspond to @xmath38 and @xmath147 in the cosmic string case .",
