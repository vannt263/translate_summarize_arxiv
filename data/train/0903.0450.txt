    "much of the progress attained in recent years in the study of the quarkonium spectra is owed to the measurements performed at @xmath0-factories .",
    "the impressive amount of data recorded by the   and belle experiments has made it possible to study rare decay chains and to look for as yet undiscovered resonances in the charmonium and bottomonium mass regions .",
    "+ results presented here are based on different sub - samples of the full datasets recorded up to now by the two experiments , corresponding to integrated luminosities of about 430 (   - final ) and about 850 ( belle ) .",
    "significant contributions also come from the analysis of the various data samples recorded by the cleo detector .",
    "charmonium states are copiously produced at @xmath0-factories in a variety of processes .",
    "+ @xmath0 mesons decay to charmonium in about 3% of cases .",
    "+ charmonium can also be produced in the continuum @xmath1 process : for the @xmath2 , for instance , the inclusive production cross section is about @xmath3 in the energy region of the @xmath0-factories .",
    "of particular interest here is the `` double - charmonium production '' process , first observed by belle , where a @xmath2 is produced together and exclusively with another charmonium state .",
    "+ states with @xmath4 are formed in @xmath5 fusion , where two virtual photons are emitted by the colliding pair ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "about 1 million @xmath7 are produced in @xmath8-equivalent of data via this mechanism .",
    "+ finally , states with @xmath9 are formed in initial state radiation ( isr ) events , where a photon is emitted by the incoming electron or positron ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the cross section for isr production of the @xmath2 at the energy of the   peak is about 2 pb . +      the discovery of the narrow @xmath11 state by belle in 2003 @xcite has marked the start of a `` new '' spectroscopy in the charmonium mass region . since then the resonant structure has been observed in different production and decay channels by cdf , d0 ,  and again belle . besides the discovery production mode @xmath12 , the @xmath11 has been observed in prompt @xmath13 production @xcite ; searches in prompt   production @xcite and in or @xmath5 formation @xcite have given negative results so far .",
    "in addition to the discovery decay mode @xmath14 ( consistent with @xmath15 ) , the decay channels @xmath16 @xcite and @xmath17 @xcite have been seen .",
    "+ detailed angular analyses @xcite , together with constraints on quantum numbers from observed production and decay modes , favour the @xmath18 assignment , although @xmath19 is not ruled out .",
    "+ the `` natural '' interpretation of the @xmath11 as a charmonium state meets with considerable difficulties @xcite : several alternative models have been proposed in recent years . given the proximity of its mass to the sum of the @xmath20 and @xmath21 masses , the @xmath11 might be an @xmath22-wave @xmath20-@xmath21 bound state , or `` molecule '' @xcite .",
    "a different approach interprets the state as a `` tetraquark '' structure , or a bound state of a diquark - antidiquark pair @xcite . in this case",
    "a total of 4 nearly - degenerate states ( 2 neutral + 2 charged ) should exist in the same mass region .",
    "other non conventional interpretations , such as a @xmath23 hybrid , are disfavoured , mainly because of the mass , which is inconsistent with current predictions .    in their most recent updates of the @xmath24 analyses ,",
    "both   and belle have shown results for the neutral , as well as for the charged , @xmath0 decay mode @xcite .",
    "using samples corresponding to @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively , they reconstructed @xmath27 and @xmath28 decays ( fig .",
    "[ fig : x3872-jpsipipi ] ) .",
    "belle reports the first statistically significant observation ( @xmath29 ) of the production mode @xmath30 ; weaker evidence is also seen in   data .",
    "+ the comparison between the charged and neutral channels is of particular interest : in the tetraquark model , two different @xmath31 states are produced in the two decays , their masses differing by @xmath32 ; moreover , in @xmath20-@xmath33 molecular models the ratio of the neutral to the charged @xmath0 decay rate may show departure from unity  @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab : x3872-jpsipipi ] reports results for the ratio of branching fractions and for the mass difference @xmath34 : the ratio appears significantly higher than 0.1 , while the measured values of @xmath35 are consistent with no mass splitting .",
    ".results from latest @xmath36 analyses from   and belle .",
    "+ [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : nony4s ]      study of the hadronic transitions between bottomonium states provides a way to test qcd multipole expansion ( qcdme ) models , which are usually employed to describe this kind of process .",
    "+ observation of non-@xmath37 hadronic decays of the   has been first published by  @xcite , following evidence for the @xmath38 decay mode previously reported by belle ; all results have been confirmed by a more recent update from belle  @xcite . in these analyses , events with a muon pair @xmath39 and a charged pion",
    "pair @xmath40 were selected . then the distribution of @xmath41 vs. @xmath42 was studied in order to identify decay chains of the type @xmath43 .",
    "in addition to @xmath44 and @xmath45 events from isr production , used as control samples , significant signals for @xmath46 and @xmath47 were found , with branching fractions of the order of @xmath48 . + in a recent update  @xcite ,   has used a data sample corresponding to 348  and added the study of the @xmath49 final state , where the @xmath50 is reconstructed in the @xmath51 channel . due to the increased statistics , the   sample now provides significant signals in many of the modes studied .",
    "+ figure  [ fig : y4s - etay1s]a shows the distribution of @xmath41 vs. @xmath52 for selected @xmath53 events .",
    "after a further selection , the signal yield for each of the decay modes is obtained from fits to the @xmath52 distributions for events within appropriate windows in @xmath54 .",
    "extraction of the branching fractions provides the most precise determination to date of @xmath55 and @xmath56 and measurements of @xmath57 comparable to current world averages .",
    "+ figure  [ fig : y4s - etay1s]b shows the distribution of @xmath58 vs. @xmath59 for selected @xmath60 events . in this case",
    "signal yields are obtained from fits to the @xmath61 distributions for events within an appropriate window in @xmath58 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : y4s - etay1s]c ) .",
    "significant yields ( @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively ) are obtained in both the @xmath39 and   samples , thus providing the first observation of the @xmath64 decay mode .",
    "the resulting branching fraction , @xmath65 , is about 2.4 times larger than the corresponding dipion rate .",
    "( note : this topic is discussed in much more detail in ref .",
    "@xcite in these proceedings . ) + another study of hadronic @xmath66 transitions has been performed by belle , using the data sample recorded at @xmath67 , near the peak of the .",
    "[ fig : anomynspipi]a shows the distribution of @xmath41 vs. @xmath52 for selected @xmath53 events ; the horizontal bands indicate the ,   and   signal regions ( bottom to top ) for @xmath41 .",
    "[ fig : anomynspipi]b shows the @xmath52 projections for events in the   and   band , where clear peaks corresponding to the @xmath68 , @xmath45 and @xmath69 , @xmath70 transitions can be clearly seen .",
    "similar peaks are found , with a somewhat smaller significance , in the @xmath71 and @xmath72 modes .",
    "+ however , when partial widths are extracted from the data , they result in values more than two orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding ones for ,   and   decays .",
    "this observation prompts the question whether the observed enhancement at @xmath73 really corresponds to the bottomonium state , or is rather suggestive of a `` hidden beauty counterpart '' of the @xmath74 state observed in the charmonium region , which shows a surprinsingly large decay rate to @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath0-factories have made a significant contribution to our knowledge of the charmonium states ( observation of the @xmath7 and possibly of the @xmath75 , new measurements of resonance parameters ) ; but most of all , in recent years , with the discovery of many unexpected and often puzzling states in the charmonium mass region , may have unveiled a whole new type of spectroscopy . +",
    "the quest for new discoveries is now being extended to the bottomonium sector , where thanks to the large amount of data accumulated and to dedicated run settings , the possibility of finding new exciting results appears concrete and is in fact already manifesting itself .",
