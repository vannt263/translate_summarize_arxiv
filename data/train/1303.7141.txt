    "interfacial superconductivity is one of the emergent phenomena that appears at the boundary between some materials , even insulators , as a consequence of a large change of physical properties of these materials at the interface , compared to their properties in the bulk.@xcite it has been experimentally evidenced since the 1950 s and 60 s that specifically fabricated thin layers of some superconductors ( e.g. sputtered onto a cold substrate of sandwiched between non - superconducting materials ) demonstrate a higher superconducting transition temperature , @xmath2 , compared to that in the bulk.@xcite however , it took several decades before the necessary technologies providing wide abilities of fabricating two - dimensional heterostructures controlled on the molecular and atomic scale were developed , which enabled the creation of many novel materials on the basis of interfaces.@xcite    the superconducting interfaces known currently , belong to the families of semiconductor / semiconductor interfaces based on different chalcogenides,@xcite insulator / insulator interfaces based on laalo@xmath3/srtio@xmath3 and related systems,@xcite as well as metal / insulator interfaces based on complex oxides such as la@xmath4sr@xmath5cuo@xmath6/la@xmath7cuo@xmath6.@xcite the origin of the interfacial superconductivity is not completely understood yet .",

    "none of them taken separately and subjected to the shock - wave pressure treatment under the same conditions , demonstrate any anomaly in @xmath45 .",
    "we believe therefore that the superconductivity in the shock - wave treated mg / mgo sample is related to the interfacial layer formed between mgo and metallic mg phases .    according to the results of both the ac susceptibility and the dc magnetization measurements , the superconducting interface in the mg / mgo - sample does not form a closed superconducting surface capable of trapping the magnetic flux and keeping it constant , but rather consists of weakly linked granular superconducting two - dimensional islands .",
    "first of all , that explains why the superconducting response is not detectable in the zero - field - cooled regime of the dc magnetization measurement , owing to the rapid decay of the surface shielding current after applying the dc magnetic field .",
    "on the contrary , in the ac mode the alternating magnetic field maintains the shielding current enabling to detect superconductivity even in discontinuous , energy dissipative superconducting loops formed by small , compared to the london penetration depth , weakly linked superconducting clusters .",
    "secondly , at temperatures well below @xmath47 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( figs .",

    "[ fig_5](b ) ) reveals a considerable normal current contribution to the energy dissipation due to partial penetration of the ac magnetic field into the metallic magnesium core of the sample .",
    "we believe therefore that the superconductivity in the mg / mgo interfacial layer is formed by thin , compared to the london penetration depth @xmath68 , superconducting islands embedded into a non - superconducting host matrix and weakly coupled to each other by the proximity effect ( if the host is metallic magnesium ) or josephson tunnelling ( for the mgo host ) .    a typical elemental distribution at the mg / mgo - interface is shown in fig .",

    "[ fig_8 ] ]    as it was mentioned above , the superconductivity of the mg / mgo - sample is unstable at room temperature .",
    "the instability manifests itself as a decay of the superconducting transition after a 10-hour exposure of the vacuum - encapsulated sample to room temperature ( figs .",
    "[ fig_6 ] and [ fig_7 ] ) , as well as vanishing of the time relaxation process of the ac susceptibility at 4.2k ( fig .",
    "[ fig_4 ] ) .",
    "the reason for such instability is apparently the oxygen / magnesium ionic diffusion processes activated at room temperature in the mg / mgo interface , which destroy the superconducting interface .",
    "the @xmath16-dependencies of @xmath38 and @xmath46 measured on the degraded mg / mgo - sample ( curves  4 in fig .  [ fig_6 ] and curves  5 in fig .  [ fig_7 ] ) are typical for normal nonmagnetic metals .",
    "namely , at room temperature the skin depth , @xmath71 , of the ac magnetic field at 5.4khz in magnesium is @xmath721.4 mm , which is bigger than the sample thickness @xmath73 mm .",
    "as the temperature decreases , the electric conductivity of the sample increases monotonically that leads to a decrease in @xmath71 , thus to a monotonic decrease in @xmath41 .",
    "@xcite at low temperatures , the electric conductivity of the sample becomes more flat in temperature , and @xmath41 sets constant .    in turn",
    ", @xmath19 characterizes the energy dissipation of the ac magnetic field in the sample , which is also a function of @xmath71 .",
    "the energy dissipation is low at @xmath74 ( high - conductivity metal ) and @xmath75 ( insulator ) , where @xmath76 is the sample depth . in the intermediate region",
    "@xmath62 has a maximum at @xmath77 .",
    "@xcite this broad maximum is seen on curve  4 in fig .",

    "[ fig_7](b ) at @xmath78k .      in a granular",
    "superconductor , positional disorder of individual superconducting grains introduces randomness and frustration into the system , resulting in a glassy behavior of the system.@xcite in our experiments , the glassy behavior of the mg / mgo - sample is evident from the observed slow dynamics of @xmath36 relaxation into the lower - energy diamagnetic ground state at 4.2k ( fig .",
    "[ fig_4 ] ) . the relaxation time , @xmath79min ,",
    "was found frequency - independent in the range 312hz  20khz .",
    "the insensibility of @xmath35 to the excitation frequency is presumably a consequence of a significant time - scale mismatch between the @xmath36 relaxation process and the ac magnetic field oscillation period , @xmath80 : the field oscillations are too fast compared to @xmath35 to significantly influence the @xmath36 process .    the origin of such a long @xmath36 relaxation process is rather puzzling .",
    "it should be related to the granular structure of the superconducting mg / mgo - interface formed by thin , compared to @xmath68 , superconducting islands weakly coupled to each other .",
    "however , no clear predictions concerning this dynamics of @xmath36 in a weak ac magnetic field exist on the basis of approaches involving collective creep or vortex - glass theories,@xcite or any of the different models including the critical - state , superconducting - loop and superconducting - glass models .",
    "@xcite    unlike @xmath35 and @xmath2 , the value of the ac susceptibility is strongly dependent on the frequency of the drive field . as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig_5](a ) , the @xmath42 plot shifts towards stronger diamagnetism with increasing the frequency , denoting a considerable contribution of the normal current component to @xmath18 even at @xmath81 .",
    "this contribution is presumably related to weak links such as inter - grain boundaries separating the superconducting grains , as well as to normal currents induced in the metallic core of the sample due to partial penetration of the ac field .    as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig_5](a ) , the step in @xmath41 at 29k becomes bigger as the driving frequency increases from 0.312 to 5.4khz ( curves 1 - 5 ) and diminishes with further frequency increase ( curves 6 - 8 ) .",
    "this can be explained assuming a superposition of normal and superconducting shielding currents contributing to @xmath41 in the granular superconductor .",
    "consider first the @xmath41 response at 29k diminishing with the frequency ( @xmath82khz , curves 5 - 8 in fig .",
    "[ fig_5](a ) ) .",
    "this effect is well known for bulk metallic superconductors : in a normal metal , increasing the ac magnetic field frequency leads to diminishing skin depth @xmath71 , hence a bigger diamagnetic signal . as a result , at high frequency",
    "the normal metal just above @xmath2 is nearly as diamagnetic as the superconductor just below @xmath2 which makes the superconducting transition indistinguishable in @xmath41 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the suggested granular structure of the superconducting mg / mgo - interface assumes intergranular weak links which can be considered as electric capacitors connected in series into the shielding supercurrent loops .",
    "obviously , the higher is frequency , the better the superconducting islands are linked , hence the stronger is the superconducting shielding .",
    "apparently , this explains the growth of the @xmath41 response at 29k at frequencies up to 5.4khz ( curves 1 - 5 in fig .",
    "[ fig_5](a ) ) .",
