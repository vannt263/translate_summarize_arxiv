    "the first mention of streams we are aware of was that of michel ( 1987 ) . the main observational evidence on which he based",
    "his idea was the sign reversal of circular polarisation at peaks of components in radio profiles .",
    "however , a detectable sign reversal could also be expected for other geometries of the beam , eg .  the patchy beam ( lyne & manchester 1988 ; manchester 2012 ) and the conal one ( rankin 1983 ) , especially if the latter is structured as the ` patchy conal ring ' in fig .  1 of karastergiou & johnston ( 2007 )",
    ". a carefull recent study of the sign reversing circular polarisation is presented in gangadhara ( 2010 ) , wang et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , and wang et al .",
    "moreover , michel s fan beams were very elongated ( @xmath0 rad ) , and more complicated than the single - parameter conal beams , which seemed to be so well designed to match the imposing flaring polar tube . they were also less attractive , with little inherent symmetry which could automatically explain the approximate left - right symmetry of some pulsar profiles ( notably of q and m class in the classification scheme of rankin 1983 )",
    ". this may be why michel s model was not recognised as a promising way to interpet radio pulsar profiles and have in principle been ignored afterwards .    a major development of the stream - based ( or fan beam ) model has recently been sparked by the properties of bifurcated features residing in pulsar profiles ( dyks et al",
    ".  2010a , hereafter drd10 ; dyks & rudak 2012 , hereafter dr12 ) .",
    "drd10 have shown that double notches ( mclaughlin & rankin 2004 ; navarro et al .",
    "1997 ; rankin & rathnasree 1997 ) can be understood in a natural way , if the elementary emitting unit has the form of an elongated stream emitting a bifurcated beam .",
    "this model required that both emitting streams and obscuring streams exist in pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "the former ones were immediately identified as the _ apparently _ conal components in the profile of psr j0437@xmath14715 , and the bifurcated precursors in psr j1012@xmath25307 .",
    "the bifurcation of a seemingly ` conal ' component in psr j0437@xmath14715 , and the fixed ( frequency - independent ) location of the ` conal ' components and notches have suggested that all these features are produced by a cut of sightline through narrow fan beams emitted by azimuthally - narrow streams .",
    "a change of the peak - to - peak separation between components observed at different frequency @xmath3 , and the associated change of pulse profile width , can be interpreted in terms of the radius - to - frequency mapping ( rfm , komesaroff 1970 ; cordes 1978 ) . according to the rfm model",
    ", the low-@xmath3 radiation is emitted at a larger radial distance @xmath4 , measured from the neutron star centre , than the high-@xmath3 radiation .",
    "however , the rfm acronym tends to be simultaneously used for the observed effect itself , ie . for the @xmath3-dependent displacement of components . to discern between the observed phenomenon and the geometrical interpretation , for the former one we will hereafter use the name _ apparent rfm_. to avoid multiple adjectives ,",
    "sometimes we will just write ` rfm ' ( in single quotation marks ) in the same sense .",
    "consequently , ` rfm ' refers to the observed change of components separation , whereas rfm to the geometrical model ( spatial association of @xmath3 with @xmath4 ) .",
    "the @xmath3-independent separation of ` conal ' components in pulsar profiles , ie .",
    "the lack of apparent radius - to - frequency mapping ( ` rfm ' ) may indeed be considered as a direct consequence of the stream - cut geometry : in the limit of an infinitely narrow stream , any radiation ( of arbitrary frequency ) can only be observed when the line of sight is in the plane of the stream .",
    "narrow streams then provide excellent conditions for the lack of the apparent rfm .",
    "the profile of psr j0437@xmath14715 , with its fixed location of components , bifurcations , and double notches has then been identified as a clear example of a profile in which the seemingly conal components are in fact not conal at all  they originate from the sightline passage through streams which , when viewed down the dipole axis , resemble a star - shaped pattern , or a pattern created by blades of an indoor ceiling fan .",
    "double notches require the obscuring streams or stream - shaped non - emitting regions within a radially- and laterally - extended emitter .",
    "since the notches are also observed in normal pulsars ( b1929@xmath210 , and b0950@xmath208 ) , drd10 have concluded that streams must be ubiquitous among pulsars .",
    "therefore , the need to extend the conal classification scheme to include the stream - shaped emitters , has been emphasized ( see fig .  18 in drd10 ) .",
    "precessing pulsars provide a direct way to map pulsar beams in 2d .",
    "however , conal beam models have not been able to reproduce the observed pulse evolution precisely ( kramer 1998 ; clifton & weisberg 2008 ; lorimer et al .  2006 ; burgay et al .",
    "this has lead to proposals of several beam shapes ( hourglass , weisberg & taylor 2002 ; horseshoe , perera et al .",
    "2010 ) which nevertheless had overall morphology similar to the conal beam .",
    "drd10 ( sect .",
    "6.3.3 therein ) suggested that the problems with the modelling of precessing beams are caused by the use of conal beams instead of the fan - shaped ones .",
    "a fan - shaped beam has explicitly been proposed for j1906@xmath20746 , based on the stability of its main pulse shape on a few - years - long timescale .",
    "that prediction of a stream emitter in j1906@xmath20746 has recently been confirmed by the beam map of desvignes et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , although their geometrical solution is not well constrained ( dipole tilt @xmath5 with respect to the spin axis is equal to @xmath6 degrees ) .",
    "an azimuthally - limited emitter has also been deduced by manchester et al .",
    "( 2010 ) .",
    "the maps of precessing pulsars have recently been reproduced in wang et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , who analyse statistical distributions of average profile properties in terms of both conal and fan models .",
    "their distribution of pulse widths as a function of impact angle provides further credence for the ubiquity of the fan - shaped geometry of pulsar beams .    a major obstacle for the acceptance of the fan - beam geometry comes from the multiple - component profiles classified as t- , q- and m - type by rankin ( 1983 ; 1993 ) .",
    "this is because they exhibit a wide range of phenomena that look deceptively conal .",
    "in particular , the peak - to - peak separation between their components increases with decreasing frequency , and this phenomenon is stronger for the outermost pair ( eg .",
    "mitra & rankin 2002 ) . for years",
    "this has been interpreted as the consequence of the fact that in dipolar magnetic field the outer circumpolar field lines are more strongly flaring away from the dipole axis than the inner ones .",
    "the conal model was also applied to the lag of the central component with respect to centroids of ` conal ' pairs , as observed in b0329@xmath254 ( gangadhara & gupta 2001 , hereafter gg01 ) and other objects ( gupta & gangadhara 2003 , hereafter gg03 ) .",
    "however , the lag had to be interpreted through a complicated structure of a near - surface emission region and several emission rings located at disparate altitudes .",
    "altitude - dependent effects of aberration and retardation ( ar ) , differentially deflecting the emission from the rings , were responsible for the observed delay .",
    "the ar effects with spatial rfm were also able to justify why the magnitude of the lag increases for decreasing frequency ( gg01 ; dyks et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the conal beam model was also supported by the statistical distributions of pulse width ( and components separation ) versus rotation period ( rankin 1990 ; 1993 ; gil et al .  1993 ; kramer et al .  1994 ) .",
    "all of them seem to suggest that widths of pulsar profile ( and angular radii of cones ) follow the inverse square root dependence on the rotation period @xmath7 .",
    "this could imply that the fixed - intensity outer envelope of pulsar emission and dimensions of cones follow the flaring shape of polar tube .",
    "the derived dimensions of cones could even find a theoretical justification ( wright 2003 ) .",
    "however , this does not exclude the possibility of the azimuthal structure of the beam .",
    "moreover , the axisymmetric beam geometry is involved in some assumptions ( eg .",
    "determination of @xmath5 from the width of the central component ) that have been used to obtain these results .",
    "in this paper we apply the implications of the broad - band emitting streams to normal radio pulsars , especially those of t , m and q type , which can probably be considered as the prototype of conal thinking .",
    "we focus mostly on the frequency evolution of profiles , using the approach of dr12 ( fig .  2 therein ) ,",
    "ie .  by considering the geometry of fixed - intensity patterns in the vicinity of the line of sight .",
    "several results of this paper apply also for the patchy beams of lyne & manchester ( 1988 ) , since a single fan - shaped subbeam can be considered as a type of an elongated patch ( fig .",
    "[ params ] ) .",
    "we will also consider circular patches of emission as a zeroth - order model for more realistic elongated beams .",
    "however , in the case of a fan beam emitted by a stream , the beam s elongation is explicitly identified : it is latitudinal and related to the curvature of b - field lines . in the case of a general patchy beam ,",
    "the elongation or geometry of patches is less constrained .",
    "for example , if a patch is elongated mostly in the magnetic azimuth , then the location of components in a profile is determined by the conal aspects of geometry .",
    "this is the case for the partial cones shown in fig .",
    "18 of drd10 ( middle sightline ) . in the present paper we focus on the latitudinally - extended patches ( fan beams ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "after a short introduction of key parameters of our model ( sect .",
    "[ params ] ) we show how the model leads to the apparent rfm effect ( sect .",
    "[ rfm ] ) . in sect .",
    "[ mapping ] we connect the apparent rfm with the spatial emissivity distribution in pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "the lag of a central component with respect to a midpoint between outer components is explained in sect .",

    "[ obscur ] which discusses possible obscuration effects .",
    "is measured counterclockwise from the main meridional plane.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the dipolar magnetic field is assumed in this work . because of the divergence of dipolar field lines , the radio - emitting region , when viewed down the dipole axis @xmath8 , typically has the form of a wedge .",
    "the region extends over a limited range of magnetic azimuth @xmath9 measured around the dipole axis , as well as over a limited range of magnetic colatitude @xmath10 , which is the angle between the radial position vector of an emission point and the dipole axis . in the dipolar field ,",
    "radiation from a point at @xmath10 propagates at the angle @xmath11 with respect to @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , the associated beam ( thick - line contour in fig .",
    "[ params ] ) extends over a range of @xmath12 that can be directly translated into @xmath10 .",
    "the propagation angle @xmath12 is marked in fig .",
    "[ params ] .",
    "the beam extends azimuthally over @xmath13  the same range of @xmath9 as the underlying stream .",
    "the latitudinal elongation of the wedge - shaped beam in fig",
    ".  [ params ] results from the 2d projection of the curved stream on the sky .",
    "the observer s sightline probes the beam along the horizontal line in fig .",
    "[ params ] and it crosses the beam at the cut angle @xmath14 measured between some fixed magnetic azimuth @xmath9 within the beam and the sightline s path ( both of them projected on the sky ) . the passage through the wedge beam lasts for a limited interval of pulse phase @xmath15 ( pulse longitude ) .",
    "[ params ] shows that the passage through the beam ( lasting over the interval @xmath16 ) corresponds to a change in angular distance from the dipole axis @xmath17 . assuming that streams follow the bent b - field lines , the passage must also be associated with a gradual change in detectable radial distance @xmath4 from the centre of the star .",
    "it is important that the probed range of angular distances from the dipole axis ( @xmath17 ) increases when the beam is cut at a smaller angle @xmath14 . for orthogonal cuts ( @xmath18 ) , as well as for extremely narrow streams , @xmath19 .",
    "the cut angle is a crucial parameter in the stream model . as will be shown below , it is responsible for several aspects of the longitude - and - frequency - dependent behaviour established for multiple - component pulsars . in some cases",
    "the cut angle @xmath14 basically mimics the effect of flaring of polar tube .",
    "the cut angle is equal to @xmath20 ( see eq .  6 in dr12 ) , where @xmath21 is the polarisation position angle measured from the main meridional plane , containing the dipole and rotation axes . in the flat case with large @xmath22 , we have @xmath23 ( fig .",
    "[ params ] ) .",
    "we additionally use the standard geometrical pulsar parameters : the dipole inclination angle @xmath5 with respect to the rotation axis @xmath24 , the viewing angle @xmath25 between @xmath24 and the observer s line of sight , and the impact angle @xmath26 .",
    "we will also use the footprint parameter @xmath27 , which is the transverse distance from the dipole axis , normalized by the transverse radius of the open field line region ( both measured at the same radial distance @xmath4 ) .",
    "by the ` observed rfm ' ( or apparent rfm , or just ` rfm ' in single quotation marks ) we mean the change of peak - to - peak separations between components observed at different frequencies , and the associated change of pulse profile width .    to illustrate its origin within the stream model",
    "we will temporarily assume that the sky - projected pattern of radio emission at a fixed frequency has a circular shape with the radio intensity decreasing away from the centre ( fig .",
    "[ rfm ] ) .",
    "one can imagine a two dimensional ( axially - symmetrical ) gaussian projected on the sky . emission at a fixed @xmath3 is not constrained to the interior of a circle only .",
    "it may be thought that the circles present , say the @xmath28% intensity level , with the peak emissivity at the centre of each circle .",
    "assuming that the spatial rfm exists and magnetic field lines flare away from the dipole axis , the low - frequency patterns should be located further away from the axis .",
    "this is shown with the sets of solid circles in fig .",
    "the circles that correspond to lower frequencies become larger because the emitting stream / wedge becomes wider at larger distance from the dipole axis .",
    "patterns can also be additionally enlarged by the increasing size of microphysical beams ( elementary beams of the emitted radiation , see dr12 ) . ] since the intensity at a fixed frequency is monotonously decreasing with the distance from the centre of each circular contour , a component s peak will be observed when the line of sight is closest to the centre of a circle corresponding to a given frequency .",
    "these phases are marked with vertical arrows , which show clear change of peak location with frequency .",
    "an equivalent description is to say that the emitted spectrum changes along the stream , and , during the passage through the stream , the line of sight samples different spectra .",
    "however , if the angular variations of a locally - emitted spectrum are ignored , the interpretive capabilities of the model are seriously hampered .",
    "therefore , we introduce the ` angular spectral gradient ' which provides a measure of how strongly the spectrum changes with angular separation on the sky . for example , the @xmath12-component of the gradient can be defined as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the average frequency emitted in direction @xmath31 , weighed by the spectral distribution of intensity .",
    "unless otherwise specified , the term ` angular spectral gradient ' will hereafter refer to the change of spectrum with @xmath12 ( at a fixed @xmath9 ) .",
    "it will also be called the ` @xmath12 spectral gradient.'-dependent intensity can change also in @xmath9 direction ( fig .",
    "[ specgrad ] ) so the gradient is two - dimensional . for brevity , however , we will use the name ` gradient ' instead of the ` @xmath12-component of the gradient ' . ] below we will also use other types of spectral gradients , eg .  the radial ( spatial ) one . we will also refer to the angular scale of spectral change in direction @xmath12 .",
    "this @xmath12 spectral scale is proportional to @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the colatitude of the centre of a pattern at the frequency @xmath3 . in fig .",
    "[ rfm ] , this scale is visualised as the separation of the circular contours corresponding to different frequencies .",
    "it is worth to emphasize that the same - size contours on different streams in fig .",
    "[ rfm ] do not necessarily need to represent the same @xmath3 .",
    "their size increases just to represent the widening of the emission region with @xmath12 .        when the line of sight cuts through a few streams with similar angular spectral gradient , the inner components exhibit weaker ` rfm ' ( fig .",
    "[ rfm ] ) .",
    "this is because the beams of inner streams are cut more orthogonally , and a given angular displacement of the fixed-@xmath3 patterns , translates to a smaller shift in pulse longitude .",
    "this is marked in fig .",
    "[ rfm ] with two horizontal arrows .",
    "note that the @xmath12-separations of the fixed-@xmath3 patterns are the same for all streams in fig .",
    "[ rfm ] just to illustrate how a given angular spectral gradient transfers onto the strength of the observed ` rfm ' . in real pulsars the angular spectral gradient may depend on @xmath12 and may be different for streams with different @xmath27",
    ". however , it may also be different for streams which differ in @xmath9 only , because the acceleration strength can vary with the distance from the main meridian ( mm ) , which contains both the rotation axis and dipole axis ( eg .  arons & scharlemann 1979 ) . as we discuss in sect .",
    "[ mapping ] the spatial rfm illustrated by the circles in fig .",
    "[ rfm ] is likely caused by both the radial and transverse drop of density in the emitting streams .",
    "an immediate consequence of the stream geometry is the expectation of weak ( or nonexistent ) ` rfm ' in three cases : 1 ) when the spectral properties of the locally - emitted radiation do not change within the observable part of the stream .",
    "for example , all points within the beam may emit a spectrum with the same shape but different normalisation . a case with weak spectral changes in the @xmath12 direction",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "2 ) when the streams / beams are extremely narrow and emit the fixed - intensity patterns in the form of narrow ellipses such as shown in fig .",
    "[ specgrad]c and [ mili ] .",
    "then the arbitrarily - large angular separations of the fixed-@xmath3 contours can not much change the position of a component .",
    "if the spread of contours in @xmath12 is very large , the component will just disappear .",
    "3 ) when a single - component profile is produced by a meridional stream ( @xmath34 ) ; in this case the component s peak position is @xmath3-independent , although the component s width may vary with frequency .    we conclude that the merging of components with increasing frequency observed in t , q and m pulsars , as well as the frequency evolution of their width , can be naturally interpreted within the fan beam model",
    ". the smaller rate of ` rfm ' observed for the inner pair of components in q and m pulsars , results from the larger cut angle @xmath14 .",
    "it is not related to the weaker flaring of the hypothetical emission region located at the inner polar magnetic flux tube .    the multistream symmetry of fig .",
    "[ rfm ] is consistent with the ubiquitous ( though approximate ) left - right symmetry of profiles : the outer components are ( on average ) cut at a larger @xmath12 from the dipole axis . if all streams are spatially equidistant from the dipole axis ( ie .",
    "have the same footprint parameter @xmath27 ) then the inner components are viewed at smaller @xmath4 .",
    "they can therefore differ from the outermost components , having different flux , spectrum , or shape . the same argument refers to the central component ( ` core ' ) , which is a stream viewed closest to the dipole axis .",
    "the stream model then retains the capability of conal model in reproducing the roughly mirror - symmetric properties of profiles .",
    "note , that the mechanism of the @xmath3-dependent displacement of components , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ rfm ] , works whenever a spectrally non - uniform beam is cut at @xmath35 , regardless of whether the spatial rfm exists or not .",
    "however , the width of the majority of profiles increases with @xmath3 ( hankins & rankin 2010 ) , which seems natural for the upward decrease of plasma density .",
    "the spatial rfm also provides a way for symmetry breaking by the ar , as described in sec .",
    "[ arcentro ] .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to relate the @xmath12 spectral gradient with the changes of the emitted spectrum along the stream , ie .  with different emission altitudes .",
    "the stream model is then capable to produce the apparent rfm effect .",
    "a hint of this capability is visible in figs .  2 and 3 of dr12 , where the peak of a bifurcated component jumps to a later pulse phase with increasing frequency .",
    "in the case of a single - peaked ( non - bifurcated ) component , its skewness would change and its peak would move rightward .",
    "the apparent rfm can be especially strong when streams are not too thin and when they are cut at small @xmath14 .",
    "the choice of observed frequency @xmath36 picks up specific contours in fig  [ rfm ] .",
    "these @xmath37-circles in different streams can be located above or below the horizontal sightline path in fig .",
    "if they are located above the path in the outermost streams , then the peak flux of outermost components will increase with decreasing @xmath3 .",
    "if at the same time the corresponding @xmath37-contours in the inner streams ( including a possible ` core stream ' ) , are located below the sightline path , a decrease of observed @xmath3 will make the peak flux of the inner components smaller .",
    "therefore , a change of observation frequency may reveal different spectral evolution of the inner pairs ( or core ) than that of the outer pair ( eg .  a brightening of the inner components at a simultaneous fading of the outer pair ) .",
    "obviously , for a detectable rfm to appear , the streams have to be spectrally - nonuniform .",
    "in general , different streams may have different @xmath12 spectral gradient . in fig .",
    "[ specgrad ] this effect is illustrated in the form of more overlapping and more elongated fixed-@xmath3 contours .",
    "this would result in different rate of component dislocation ( and fading ) with frequency , even when they have the same @xmath14 ( as is the case in fig .",
    "[ specgrad ] ) . therefore , to obtain a more complete view of pulsar emission , it is necessary to allow for the convolution of the spectral gradient with the effects of @xmath14 .",
    "differences in the spectral gradient likely exist in pulsars and contribute to the large variety of the observed behaviour of profiles ( hankins & rankin 2010 ; kramer et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "one can imagine a model , in which the spectral gradient changes monotonously with the azimuthal distance @xmath9 from the mm .",
    "when convolved with the effect of @xmath14 shown in fig .",
    "[ rfm ] , this could change the rate of , stop , or reverse the apparent rfm . while such azimuthal spectral non - uniformity is possible , it does",
    "not automatically implies that the outer pair of components should exhibit stronger apparent rfm .",
    "the value of @xmath14 then remains the primary and unavoidable factor , which determines the relative rate of components displacement .",
    "however , if the spectral differences between the beams are strong , they need to be superposed on the effect of @xmath14 .       is marked in grey , higher @xmath3  in black .",
    "only the strongest - emissivity regions are marked for the conal model .",
    "note the strong apparent rfm implied by the conal model for msps .",
    "for the stream model , the sky - projected beams are schematically presented on the far left ( msps ) and top ( normal pulsars ) .",
    "see figs .",
    "[ specgrad]c and [ specgrad]b , respectively , for a more clear presentation of the beams .",
    ", scaledwidth=47.0% ]    the key difference between the millisecond pulsars ( msps ) and normal pulsars is that b - field lines flare ( bend away from the dipole axis ) more strongly in the former case . for a fixed scale of radial spectral gradient ,",
    "assumed to be universal for both the msps and normal pulsars , the traditional conal model would imply much stronger ` rfm ' for the msps .",
    "however , if the radio frequency corresponds to the plasma frequency , emission at two frequencies should occur at radial distances which are at a fixed ratio , as determined by the frequencies . in that case",
    "an apparent rfm of comparable magnitude would be expected for both the msps and normal pulsars . in the bottom half of fig .",
    "[ pers ] , conal emission regions for both types of pulsars have been illustrated for two frequencies at the same ratio of @xmath4 .",
    "available observational data ( eg .  kramer et al .",
    "1999 ; you et al .  2007 ) clearly contradict this expectation and show that msps do not exhibit the apparent rfm .    however , the lack ( or weakness ) of the ` rfm ' in msps is naturally expected in the stream model . with more bent b - field lines ,",
    "the streams in magnetospheres of msps are likely to produce beams that are more elongated in the @xmath12-direction , and are more likely to be cross - cut by the line of sight .",
    "more importantly , however , changes of the spectrum with altitude are spread over a very elongated beam .",
    "therefore , the spectrum emitted at different points in the vicinity of the line of sight , does not change much with @xmath12 .",
    "this corresponds to the overlapping and elongated fixed-@xmath3 patterns shown in fig .",
    "[ specgrad]c . in the case of normal pulsars ,",
    "the radiation from within a much larger range of altitudes , ie .  with a larger spectral diversity ,",
    "is projected onto a much smaller angular area on the sky ( see the top part of fig .  [ pers ] ) .",
    "therefore , the spectrum changes on a smaller angular scale in the beam of normal pulsars .",
    "this corresponds to the less overlapping fixed-@xmath3 contours such as those in fig .",
    "[ specgrad]b .    in the case of the msps , radiation emitted in a specific direction has a larger spectral extent ( is more broadband ) than in the normal pulsars .",
    "while a stream of a msp is being cut by the line of sight , the observer detects radiation from only a small portion of the stream s extent , because the radiation is emitted within a small angle @xmath38 around the velocity vector ( @xmath39 is the lorentz factor ) and the curvature radius @xmath40 of the b - field lines is small . in the case of normal pulsars , with small curvature of b - field lines , at any instant the observer probes a larger range of @xmath4 .",
    "however , this larger @xmath41 corresponds to a smaller range of plasma density , which can be shown as follows . in a dipolar field",
    ", the range of plasma density @xmath42 is related to @xmath41 through @xmath43 , where @xmath44 , as implied by the size of the microbeam . for the curvature radiation with the peak frequency @xmath45 ,",
    "the microbeam size is @xmath46 . in a dipolar field @xmath47 , so @xmath48 . in msps @xmath4",
    "is two orders of magnitude larger , and @xmath7  two orders of magnitude smaller , than in normal pulsars .",
    "the range of plasma densities implied by the microbeam - size limitation is then much larger in the case of msps than in normal pulsars .",
    "the spectrum emitted in some direction @xmath49 is , therefore , wider in the case of msps .",
    "another constraint on the range of plasma densities probed at a fixed @xmath49 is related to the instantaneous visibility of the emission region in the case when the extent of the @xmath38 microbeam is negligible ( emission strictly tangent to b - field lines ) . for simplicity ,",
    "let us ignore the aberration - retardation effects ( described in sect .",
    "[ ar ] ) , the issue of obscuration ( sect .",
    "[ obscur ] ) and the possible torsion of electron trajectories ( hence of the stream shape ) . then at a single pulse phase",
    "the line of sight can receive radiation from within a single plane of fixed @xmath9 within the emiter .",
    "the observer is simultaneously detecting radiation from all the points within the plane , where the b - field is inclined at a single angle @xmath12 with respect to @xmath50 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ visi ] , in the dipolar field these points are located along a straight radial line with a fixed magnetic colatitude @xmath51 .",
    "thick parts of the line , which overlap with the grey emission regions , are quasi - simultaneously visible by the observer .",
    "[ visi ] shows two emission regions : the bottom one for a fast millisecond pulsar ( @xmath52 ms ) , and the upper one for a bit slower rotator .",
    "it can be seen that for a similar thickness of the streams in @xmath53 direction , the observer samples a smaller interval of @xmath4 in the case of the msp ( bottom grey region ) .",
    "the above - discussed extent of the @xmath38 microbeam affects this picture by providing some non - zero @xmath53-width to the simultaneously detectable region . despite the smaller @xmath54 ,",

    "in such a case , the low-@xmath3 radiation would still be observed , but the low-@xmath3 pulse component would become weaker , in comparison to the same - frequency components described before ( as well as in comparison to the components at higher @xmath3 ) .",

    "then the sightline moves obliquely through the stream and exits it at phase ` 2 ' , associated with the visibility line no .",
    "2. the low - density region that overlaps with a visibility line is split in two parts , one on the top , another on the bottom side of the stream .",
    "the question on whether the radiation from the bottom part can reach the observer is difficult and depends on several factors , such as the polarisation of the emitted wave , and the temporal / spatial variations of plasma density in the stream .",
    "a qualitative inclusion of the bottom - side emission would require an interesting , but lengthy analysis of a more complicated version of fig .",
    "8 . for brevity",
    ", therefore , it is now assumed that the bottom side of the stream ( the part of the stream on its concave side ) contributes little to the observed flux .",
    "the dashed line presents the case when the altitude of peak emissivity steeply decreases with increasing frequency .",
    "a cut through a stream with such a property would result in normal ` rfm ' , shown in the bottom inset of fig .",
    "[ visi3 ] .",
    "this is because the strongest low-@xmath3 emission is observed early in the 1 - 2 phase interval , when the observer is sampling visibility lines located close to the line no .  ` 1 ' .",
    "high-@xmath3 emission will peak closer to phase ` 2 ' , since the high-@xmath3 emissivity is strongest nearby the visibility line no .",
    "2. we remind that the decline of flux at the edges of the 1 - 2 interval is caused by the azimuthal emissivity profile , which needs to be convolved with the radial profile peaking at the dashed line .",
    "the dot - dashed line presents the fixed-@xmath10 case when all frequencies peak roughly in the middle of the 1 - 2 phase interval .",
    "this would not induce much ` rfm ' , because the convolution of two coincident bell - shaped profiles does not change the peak s position ( see the dot - dashed components in the middle panel of the inset ) .",
    "thus the dot - dashed section is a separatrix between the normal ` rfm ' and the inverse ` rfm ' , in which case the lower-@xmath3 profiles would be observed closer to the centre of the profile .",
    "the speed at which the line of sight crosses consecutive azimuths @xmath9 increases towards the mm , as has always been illustrated by the s - swing of the polarisation position angle . therefore , the separatrix that corresponds precisely to the centre of the 1 - 2 pulse interval is located not exactly in the middle between the visibility lines ` 1 ' and 2. for the leading component shown in fig .",
    "[ visi3 ] , the separatrix is closer to the visibility line ` 2 ' .    an interesting case leading to the inverse apparent rfm is represented by the first dotted line , marked ` a ' .",
    "the spatial rfm is normal in this case , with the peak emissivity located at a larger @xmath4 for the lower-@xmath3 region .",
    "however , the low-@xmath3 radiation peaks at a later phase ( closer to the visibility line ` 2 ' ) than the high-@xmath3 emission , that peaks closer to phase ` 1 ' .",
    "this is then the case when the normal spatial rfm leads to the inverse apparent rfm , illustrated with the dotted profiles in the top inset .",
    "the second dotted line , marked ` b ' , presents the case with no spatial rfm .",
    "the peak emissivity at all frequencies occurs at the same radial distance @xmath4",
    ". the line ` b ' is then orthogonal to the separatrix described above .",
    "orientation of the dotted line with respect to the visibility lines ` 1 ' and ` 2 ' reveals that the low - frequency component ( top curve in the top inset ) will definitely peak closer to phase ` 2 ' , whereas the high-@xmath3 component closer to phase ` 1 ' .",
    "this is the case when the lack of spatial rfm results in the inverse apparent rfm .",
    "the nearly horizontal dotted line ` c ' presents the case with the altitude of peak emissivity steeply decreasing with decreasing @xmath3 .",
    "it produces a similar profile evolution as in the previous case ( top inset ) .",
    "thus , the frequency - dependent behaviour of profiles ( ` rfm ' , no ` rfm ' , or inverse ` rfm ' ) , depends on the spatial emissivity distribution around the fixed-@xmath10 separatrix that corresponds to the central azimuth of the stream @xmath56 .",
    "since the majority of pulsars exhibits normal rfm , it is concluded that typically the altitude of the strongest emissivity at a given frequency quickly increases with decreasing @xmath3 , as the straight dashed line shows qualitatively .",
    "this is consistent with the common expectation of plasma density drop with altitude illustrated by the contours in fig .",

    "interestingly , however , it is possible to observe the reverse rfm even for the peak - emissivity altitude increasing with decreasing @xmath3 ( case ` a ' ) .",
    "position of a central component in multiple - component profiles often lags a centroid located half way between outer components . gg01",
    "have shown that this can be caused by the aberration and retardation ( ar ) effects operating at different emission altitudes of the core , inner cone , and outer cone .",
    "the ar - induced shift of a centroid is approximately equal to @xmath62 , ie .",

    "it has therefore been widely used to determine @xmath4 as well as the transverse distance of the cones from the dipole axis , ie .  the footprint parameter @xmath27 ( gg01 ; gg03 ) .",
    "however , the ensuing structure of the radio emission region ( with a variety of @xmath4 and @xmath27 ) have revealed unacceptable arbitrariness , difficult to interpret in terms of physics .",
    "for example , instead of the lateral separation of emission rings ( ruderman & sutherland 1975 ; wright 2003 ) , for psr b0329@xmath254 gg01 invoke as many as four radially - separated emission cones at roughly the same b - field lines ( @xmath63 ) . as found in gg03 ( and adjusted in table 1 of dyks et al .",

    "as soon as one allows for the azimuthal structure of the radio emission region , the centroid shift can be understood without invoking emitters at disparate altitudes . as we show below , with several streams extending within the same altitude range ,",
    "the shift can still be understood in two ways : 1 ) through the altitude - dependent ar effects that break the symmetry of the system of streams ( sect .  [ arcentro ] ) , and 2 ) just through an accidental asymmetry of location of the beam system with respect to the mm , whatever is the reason for the asymmetry . in the latter case , discussed in the next subsection ,",
    "the centroids are shifted regardless of emission altitudes , ie .",
    "the shift is non - zero even for exactly the same emission altitude within the entire emission beam ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 ) .",
    "the ar effects are not involved in this mechanism .",
    "the key factor that leads to the centroid shift in both mechanisms , is the asymmetry of streams / beams with respect to the mm , with the cut angle @xmath14 again responsible for the frequency - dependence of the phenomenon .",
    "below we test the two mechanisms against the observed properties of the centroid shift phenomenon .",
    "we start with the simple case with no ar effects included .      since the pulsars considered by gg03 exhibit approximate symmetry of their profiles , we consider a beam system which is perfectly symmetric with respect to the central plane ( @xmath56-plane ) of its central stream .",
    "to emulate the asymmetry , the beam system is rotated by a small angle @xmath69 with respect to the mm .",
    "such a system with five identical beams is presented in fig .",
    "[ centroid ] .",
    "consecutive circles along each beam again present the fixed - intensity contours at different and equally separated @xmath3 . all the contours are also equally separated in @xmath12 , ie .",
    "the @xmath12 spectral gradient is assumed to be the same for all beams . the misalignment of the system with respect to the mm produces a lag of the central component with respect to the centroids of the flanking pairs .",
    "this is because in the considered case ( flat geometry with @xmath70 ) the observed pulse longitude of a component is given by : @xmath71 where the angle @xmath72 corresponds to the fixed - intensity contour at the observed frequency @xmath3 , ( hereafter the index @xmath3 will be omitted ) , and @xmath9 is the azimuth of the stream ( note that @xmath9 is negative on the ls and positive on the ts ) .",

    "however , gg03 also show that in the observed profiles the flanking pairs of components precede the ` core ' by a phase interval which increases with decreasing @xmath3 . to test if the ` accidental asymmetry ' model of fig .",
    "[ centroid ] can explain this , we will use the following simple mathematical model . with the flat and equatorial approximation ( small beam , @xmath85 )",

    "accordingly , with _ decreasing _ frequency , the central component moves rightward at the rate : @xmath91 where the index ` ctc ' stands for the ` central component ' , and we have substituted @xmath92 for the @xmath12 spectral scale of the central component .",

    "this contributes to the left - right asymmetry of the profile , because the ls patterns become more spread on the sky , so the peak flux of a leading component decreases in comparison to a ` corresponding ' trailing component .",
    "this effect should be strongest for fast rotators , and may be responsible for the ubiquitous weakness of the ls in main pulses of msps ( see eg .",
    "fig .  2 in drd10 ; demorest 2007 ) .",
    "thus the extension of the ls emission over a long stretch of pulse longitude occurs also in the stream model , along with the simultaneous pile up of emission on the ts ( see .",
    "dyks et al .",

    "this enhances the asymmetry of components shifts thereby increasing the centroid shift .",
    "ghz and @xmath116 ghz , corresponds to the transition from one elliptic contour to the adjacent one . for a more broadband spectrum ( more overlapping ellipses on the ts ) , the angular displacement ( measured along the beam ) of a @xmath117-ghz contour from a @xmath116-ghz contour is smaller .",
    "hence the shift of the trailing component is smaller than that of the leading one , for which the spectrum is less broadband ( less overlapping ellipses ) . ]",
    "thus , the ar - induced asymmetry does not only generate the shift through the asymmetry of @xmath14 .",
    "it may also make the ts spectrum more broadband , increasing the disproportion of the shifts on the ls and ts .",
    "because of the spectral gradient asymmetry , the trailingmost component should have a broader spectrum , ie .  extending over a wider range of @xmath3 , than the leadingmost component .",
    "the ts of a main pulse should then exhibit weaker shape evolution with @xmath3 than the trailing side , as observed eg .  for psr j1012@xmath25307 ( dyks et al .",
    "2010b ) .      as in sect .",

    "the pulse longitude of a component is given by @xmath118 where @xmath119 represents the pulse longitude observed for a beam with no ar effects included ( fig .  [ aber]a , eq .  [ faza ] ) , and the ar shift is equal to @xmath120 where @xmath121 , and @xmath122 is the footprint parameter ( eg .  arons 1983 ) . in the case of a non - orthogonal dipole inclination @xmath5 , the first term of eq .

    "the observed pulse longitude of a component changes with decreasing frequency at the rate of @xmath124 as before , the negative derivative is considered to learn how the profiles evolve with decreasing frequency .",
    "the central component ( @xmath125 ) therefore moves leftward at the ` spectral speed ' @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the magnetic colatitude of the propagation direction for the point at which the line of sight is passing through the ` core ' .",

    "[ aber ] , for @xmath139 the centroid speed is larger than the ` core ' speed @xmath140 , because at the locations probed by the line of sight @xmath141",
    ". the observed @xmath3-dependent speed at which the centroid moves with respect to the central component is given by : @xmath142 eq .",
    "has the required property of producing larger shift of centroid for the more peripheral ( outer ) pairs of components ( which have larger @xmath12 at the sightline - crossing points ) .",
    "moreover , the shift increases with decreasing @xmath3 , because @xmath143 and @xmath93 for the pulsars analysed in gg03 .",
    "the ar effect can thus generate all the observed @xmath3-dependent effects exhibited by these pulsars .",
    "in contrast to the accidental shift caused by the beam - system misalignment , the ar effects displace the centroid in only one direction ( leftward , provided @xmath4 is smaller for inner components )",
    ". the ar shift can therefore be either enhanced or made weaker by the misalignment .",
    "if locations of streams in pulsars are accidental , in most cases the central component should lag the centroids . the opposite arrangement ( lag of the centroid )",
    "can occur only for objects in which the misalignment dominates over the ar effects .",
    "the widely - used method of @xmath4-determination from the ` core ' lag needs to be reconsidered in view of the stream interpretation . if the streams in the corotating pulsar magnetosphere are so symmetric as shown in fig .",
    "[ aber]a , then , from eq .  , the ` core ' lag is equal to : @xmath144 thus",
    ", the published emission altitudes that were derived within the conal model may still represent the altitude differences between the ` core ' component and the flanking components .",
    "this is because it does not matter whether the ar - shifted patches of intensity are fragments of a single cone or fragments of two symmetric streams .",
    "what has changed is the interpetation of the altitude  it now represents the altitude of that part of a stream that happened to be probed by our line of sight .",
    "the ` core ' altitude , eg . , represents the altitude of the sightline - crossing point  it does not have to be next to the neutron star surface .",
    "it needs to be emhasized that the ar - induced lag of ` core ' is a robust effect which operates also for not perfectly symmetric system of streams . in the asymmetric case shown in fig .",
    "[ centroid ] , the ar effects would also bend the streams forward .",
    "the components would accordingly move forward in phase , enhancing the ` core ' lag that results from the misalignment alone . in the case of the leftward misalignment of the beam system ( negative @xmath69 ) the ar effects",
    "could possibly lead to the ` core ' lag , provided they were stronger than the effects of the misalignment , which occurs roughly for @xmath145 .",
    "the magnitude of the ar shift quickly increases with @xmath12 so the ar - induced ` core ' lag is likely to appear also for systems of streams which are not fully symmetric with respect to the mm .    however , the fact that the _ magnitude _ of the centroid shift can be affected by _ any _ asymmetry of the type shown in fig",
    ".  [ centroid ] , makes the altitudes obtained with the ar - lag method less reliable . direct use of eq .",
    "is risky , because it assumes perfect symmetry of the stream system and ignores spectral differences between the streams ( eg .",
    "one may have @xmath146 for the flanking streams ) . in the case of the intrinsically asymmetric beam structure , results of sect .",
    "[ accidental ] need to be convolved with the ar lag .",
    "therefore , whereas the ar - induced lag can be observed also for the intrinsically non - symmetric geometry , eq .   is valid only for the fully symmetric case .",
    "we conclude that the ar effects working within streams with spatial spectral gradient ( spatial rfm ) explain both the broken symmetry of profiles , as well as the increasing strength of this effect with decreasing frequency .",
    "we emphasize that in the stream model the low altitude of the ` core ' is not an ad - hoc assumption made to produce the observed centroid shift . in the stream model the low-@xmath4 location of ` core ' naturally results from the dipolar geometry of streams , which near the dipole axis ( small @xmath12 ) occupy small @xmath4 . in the case of the inner components ( associated with more meridional streams ) the line of sight cuts through the streams at a smaller angle @xmath12 and smaller @xmath4 , provided the streams have similar @xmath27 .",
    "we have discussed only the simplest case of identical streams located at different azimuth @xmath9 . a much larger variety of streams ( with different @xmath27 , @xmath4 , @xmath10 , @xmath89 , and azimuthal widths and separations ) apparently exist in magnetospheres of real pulsars .",
    "this would explain the diversity of observed properties of pulsar profiles .    .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "in the cone / core scenario the radio emission was believed to originate from well - separated and narrow intervals of altitude and footprint parameter .",
    "this was not likely to lead to obscuration effects .",
    "in the case of elongated streams , the geometry that leads to eclipses of lower-@xmath4 emission can appear in at least two cases .",
    "first , this happens when a laterally extended , quasi - uniform emission is blocked from our view by a dense non - emitting stream .",
    "this case was shown to produce deep double notches in the profiles of both normal and millisecond pulsars ( drd10 ; dr12 ; mclaughlin & rankin 2004 ) .",
    "second , when the central high - density region of the stream extends sufficiently far in the longitudinal direction , the bottom parts of the stream , located on its concave side , can also be eclipsed ( ie .",
    "the radiation from this region can be scattered or absorbed and dissipated ) .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ visi ] , in which the lowermost ` ray ' , emitted near the bottom of the lower emission region , must cross the full thickness of the region before reaching the outer low - density regions . depending on the transverse gradient of plasma density in the stream , and on the observed frequency , the ray can be obscured .",
    "this can diminish the flux observed at the centre of a component , producing a bifurcated emission component ( bec ) , similar to those observed in psr j0437@xmath14715 and j1012@xmath25307 .",
    "moreover , the tubular shape of transverse density pattern ( fig .  [ robak ] ) should additionally enhance the flux in the azimuthally - outer parts of the associated component .",
    "this is because the radio emission occurs within the planes of fixed magnetic azimuth @xmath9 ( if the extent of the @xmath38 microbeam is negligible ) .",
    "crossections of the stream with these fixed @xmath9 planes are shown with the arrows in fig .",
    "[ robak ] .",
    "different zones of equal density are shown with different grades of grey .",
    "since the radio emission occurs in the planes containing the arrows and the dipole axis , the largest emissivity per steradian corresponds to the azimuthal sides of the stream .",
    "thus a ` limb brightening ' can be expected .",
    "emission at a larger frequency originates from the inner regions of the stream ( the inner ring in fig .",
    "[ robak ] ) which implies the narrowing of becs with frequency , consistent with the observations of psr j0437@xmath14715 and j1012@xmath25307 .",
    "thus , the nature of becs may be macroscopic , and not related to the microphysical ( elementary ) emission beam .",
    "this would solve the problem of large energetic requirements implied by the microscopic interpretation ( dyks & rudak 2013 ; gil & melikidze 2010 ) .",
    "however , it is less clear why the becs should have so high symmetry as observed , because rotation tends to remove the stream away from the path of a to - be - eclipsed ray .",
    "it is also important to note that in the superstrong magnetic field only the radiation in the ordinary polarisation mode would be eclipsed .",
    "the extraordinary polarisation mode , however , is not emitted within the @xmath9-plane anyway ( drd10 ; gil et al .",
    ". the mode - dependent obscuration would introduce imbalance between the observed contribution of orthogonal polarisation modes , which should change with the distance from a bec s centre .",
    "it is also possible that both factors ( micro- and macroscopic ) shape the becs .",
    "regardless of this issue , the general interpretation of the becs in msps remains similar to the one described in drd10 and dr12 : they are caused by the broad - band , locally - bidirectional radio emission , and are observed when our line of sight passes through streams in pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "the only difference is that in the macroscopic case , the quasi - local bifurcation is attributed to the opacity of a segment of a narrow stream .    with the possibility of the macroscopically - generated , locally - bidirectional beams",
    ", one needs to ask if double notches can also be created by obscuration of these macroscopic bifurcated beams .",
    "this does not seem to be possible , because the emitter associated with the phenomenon of double notches ( see fig .",
    "12 in drd10 ) has to be extended in two dimensions ( azimuth and latitude ) to be consistent with the quasi - isotropic radio emission in which double notches are observed .",
    "the emitter does not have the geometry of the stream shown in fig .",
    "[ robak ] .",
    "moreover , the notches are well - fitted with the curvature radiation microbeam ( fig .  6 in dr12 ) ,",
    "have different shapes than becs ( sect .  3.3 in dr12 ) , and all of them are narrower than the problematic bec of psr j1012@xmath25307 ( see fig .  4 in dyks & rudak 2013 ) .",
    "therefore , the microscopic nature of double notches continues to present a promising model .",
    "we have shown that the main frequency - dependent phenomena exhibited by radio pulsar profiles : the apparent rfm and the frequency - dependent centroid shift can be naturally explained within the stream model  the model which assumes fan - shaped radiation beams produced by streams flowing in pulsar magnetosphere .    by considering the spatial spectral gradient along the stream ,",
    "we have shown that even some detailed aspects of the phenomena can be effortlessly reproduced by the stream model .",
    "these include the weaker apparent rfm of the inner ` conal ' pair , as well as the increasingly large centroid shift at lower frequencies .",
    "the weak spreading of inner pair components is a trivial consequence of more orthogonal stream cutting . in the stream model",
    ", the shift of centroids does not require the complicated and arbitrary positioning of the core , inner cone and outer cone emission at disparate altitudes and magnetic colatitudes .",
    "instead , the altitude differences result naturally from the geometry of the cut itself .",
    "surprisingly the shifts of centroids of both signs can appear even with no altitude differences ( and no ar affects ) associated with the fan beam .",
    "however , only the backward misalignment of the beam system has the properties consistent with pulsars described in gg01 and gg03 . whenever both the shift - inducing conditions exist , ie .  when the symmetric system of beams is misaligned and emission altitude increases towards the periphery of the beam , then the ar shift can be enhanced , diminished or reversed by the effects of the misalignment .",
    "in contrast to the misalignment shift , the ar shift always provides the type ( sign ) of the asymmetry and the frequency behaviour which is observed for pulsars described by gg03 .",
    "this naturally results from the geometry of streams which in the dipolar field occupy low altitudes at small @xmath12 .    in the case of the stream model , even for identical locations of the streams on their corresponding planes of fixed magnetic azimuth ( same @xmath147 , @xmath41 ) ,",
    "the approximate left - right symmetry of profile properties is likely to appear because smaller altitudes are sampled for inner ( more meridional ) streams .",
    "the ` core ' component is created by the sightline cut through a near - meridional stream whereby the lowest altitudes are probed .",
    "the altitude differences required to produce the centroid shift ensue naturally , because the line of sight picks up a lower - altitude emission in the middle of the profile , ie .  no radial displacements need to be introduced between different streams to generate the ar lag of the central component ( though in general such differences in @xmath4 are not excluded ) .",
    "the stream model can also explain some differences between the frequency - dependent behaviour of normal pulsars and msps .",
    "it has been shown that by introducing the azimuthal non - uniformity to the pulsar beam one can avoid several problems which remain challenging for the conal model .",
    "in particular , the problem of origin of the ` core ' component in the conal model disappears , with the role of the physical core region taken over by the central stream .",
    "interestingly , the observed ` core ' emission is still found to originate from the lowest altitudes and this is probably why its properties are sometimes observed to be different from properties of the outer components .",
    "similar effects ( decrease of @xmath4 towards the centre of the profile ) are likely responsible for the apparent symmetry of fluctuation spectra with respect to the centre of profiles ( backer 1970 ; maan & deshpande 2014 ) . the origin of subpulse drift ( eg .  weltevrede et al .  2007 ; ruderman & sutherland 1975 ) , the apparent ` carousel circulation ' ( deshpande & rankin 2001 ) and other single - pulse effects certainly deserve a careful study within the stream model with azimuthally - structured average emission pattern .",
    "the new type of radio beam may also impact the population studies ( story et al .",
    "2007 ) and the multiwavelength lightcurve fitting ( pierbattista et al .  2014 ; venter et al .",
    "2012 ; romani & watters 2010 ) .",
    "the elongated beams also provide the flexibility that is needed to interpret profiles of difficult objects such as the crab pulsar ( moffett & hankins 1996 ) or psr b1821@xmath124 ( johnson et al .  2013 ; knight et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the azimuthal structure calls for explanation itself .",
    "results of this paper suggest that more efforts should be put into the understanding of the azimuthal nonuniformity of pulsar magnetosphere , instead of the radially - separated emission rings , which seemed to be justified by the ` core'-lag effect , or by the general applicability of the conal classification scheme .",
    "the apparent rfm and the centroid shift were providing considerable support for the conal beam model .",
    "however , we have shown that these conal interpretations can be successfully replaced with the stream - based reasoning .",
    "furthermore the stream model is able to explain even such ` peculiarities ' as the bifurcated components and double notches , which makes it a very successfull tool to interpret radio pulsar beams .",
    "the evidence for the stream model ( or fan - beam model ) is mounting steadily .",
    "as recently shown by wang et al .",
    "( 2014 ) the fan beam model is more successful in reproducing the observed statistics of profiles width and flux than the conal model . in the upcoming paper ( pierbattista & dyks , in preparation )",
    "we show that the statistics of component locations within the profiles with 4 and 5 components ( q and m class ) is inconsistent with the nested cone model .",
    "teixeira et al .  ( 2014 ) show that probably the most symmetric example of the q - type profile ( j0631@xmath21036 , zepka et al .",
    "1996 ) is best explained by the multiple - stream model , which avoids several problems of the conal interpretation .",
    "all this development is additionally supported by the recent beam maps of precessing pulsars , including the feebly constrained but fairly suggestive map of j1906@xmath20746 .",
    "the difficulties in reproducing the beam maps of other precessing pulsars with the use of conal beams , are likely caused by application of inappropriate beam topology .",
    "the stream model is then supported by variety of arguments , it is able to explain several pulsar features , and avoids several problems of the conal model . with no reserve",
    "we therefore advance the view that pulsars possess fan beams emitted by outflowing plasma streams , whereas the nested cone / core beams may well not exist .",
