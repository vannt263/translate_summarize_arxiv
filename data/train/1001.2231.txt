    "for a few simple lattice field theories monte carlo simulation algorithms are known that are virtually free of critical slowing down . in these cases",
    "we have an almost qualitatively improved control over approaching the universal continuum or scaling limit which is essential for particle as well as statistical physics applications .",
    "one important line of such developments started from the swendsen wang cluster algorithm @xcite for potts , and in particular ising models , in arbitrary dimension . in @xcite the present author",
    "has shown how via embedded ising spins these techniques can be extended to o(@xmath3 ) invariant sigma models .",
    "this has led to numerous high precision simulations close to criticality in the literature .",
    "unfortunately efforts to widen the applicability to other theories have since ended in frustration in many cases . a well known example concerning the cp(@xmath4 model family is discussed in @xcite .",
    "some theoretical understanding of the restriction to o(@xmath3 ) is given in @xcite .",
    "significant progress in the simulation of cp(@xmath5 models has nevertheless been made in the sequel , for example with the non - recursive multigrid ( ` unigrid ' ) method in @xcite , @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "@xcite an interesting but somewhat indirect method via quantum models and their reduction from higher dimension was presented .",
    "nonetheless cp(@xmath4 systems seem to remain a challenging testing ground for hopefully more systematically generalizable attempts to boost the efficiency of the numerical evaluation of lattice field theory .",
    "a completely different recent research programme is based on the proposal of a monte carlo summation of the strong coupling series ( in a certain simple form ) which replaces the sampling of lattice field configurations . for many models of interest",
    "this series converges for any given _",
    "finite _ volume and choice of parameters , and the in general infinite set of strong coupling graphs may be considered as an equivalent non - perturbative representation of the original lattice model .",
    "` worm ' algorithms generalizing those described in @xcite were the essential tool to allow for an efficient simulation of this ensemble . in this formulation criticality",
    "means that large graphs are important , which are far too numerous for systematic evaluation .",
    "the question if a monte carlo procedure can efficiently sample a sufficient subset seems rather different from the problem of collectively updating long distance correlated fields .",
    "little other means than numerical experiments are presently available to answer this distinct and open question .",
    "we here extend the recent series of papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite to give an affirmative answer also for @xmath6 .    in particular in @xcite many details for the treatment of non - abelian models have been developed that are similar here",
    ". therefore we have to constantly refer to this work and the present paper could not really become self - contained without excessive repetition . on the other hand here",
    "further progress is made for the simulation method that can be used to also render the o(@xmath3 ) model simulations even more efficient that what was described in @xcite .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section 2 .",
    "we formulate the cp(@xmath4 model in several discretizations and derive the equivalent loop models . for their simulation",
    "an algorithm is described in section 3 and numerically applied in section 4 . in section 5 .",
    "the loop formulation is generalized to include the @xmath7 parameter coupled to the topological charge , but related numerical experiments are left to possible future publications .",
    "we end in section 6 . with some brief conclusions .",
    "the cp(@xmath0 ) model is formulated with spins on lattice sites with values in a complex @xmath0 dimensional projective space .",
    "they may be represented by one - dimensional projectors or by complex @xmath3-component unit vectors @xmath8 whose phases are irrelevant .",
    "one of the standard lattice actions @xcite in use can be written as @xmath9 = \\beta \\sum_{x \\mu } [ u ( x , \\mu ) \\phi^{\\dag } ( x ) \\phi ( x +    \\hat{\\mu } ) + u^{- 1 } ( x , \\mu ) \\phi^{\\dag } ( x + \\hat{\\mu } ) \\phi ( x ) ] .    \\label{su}\\ ] ] we here sum over all links of a hypercubic periodic lattice in @xmath1 dimensions with extent @xmath10 in direction @xmath11 .",
    "we use lattice units in which the @xmath10 are integer and @xmath12 is the number of lattice cells or sites .",
    "in addition to the spin field @xmath13 a u(1 ) gauge field @xmath14 is included which can absorb local phase transformations of @xmath15 .",
    "there also is a global su(@xmath3 ) invariance with @xmath13 in the fundamental representation . in a first step",
    "we consider @xmath16 as a given ` background ' field over which we integrate later .",
    "we define the following partition function with two contracted adjoint composite insertions @xmath17 = \\int \\left [ \\prod_z d \\mu ( \\phi ( z ) ) \\right ] { \\mathrm{e}}^{- s    [ \\phi , u ] } \\phi^{\\dag } ( u ) \\lambda^a \\phi ( u ) \\phi^{\\dag } ( v ) \\lambda^a",

    "all su(@xmath3 ) indices get contracted and the various terms correspond to strong coupling graphs on the lattice .",
    "on each link we draw @xmath45 lines with arrows in the positive direction and @xmath46 lines with opposite arrows . at each site",
    "@xmath47 we again imagine all possible ways to saturate all derivatives as a ` switchboard ' that connects ( contracts ) all surrounding lines pairwise with each other , always an incoming to an outgoing one .",

    "the chosen 2-vertex belongs to a passive loop .",

    "we found the greater flexibility here useful to prevent acceptance rates from getting small . in all runs",
    "reported about below we have taken @xmath133 and found unproblematic high acceptance rates .",
    "in addition there are no analogs of the steps iii , iiii and iii of @xcite .",
    "we found that they are not essential and also the o(@xmath3 ) algorithm may be simplified correspondingly . as a more technical change",
    "we have slightly modified the handling of the threefold linked list . as before two linkages allow to travel along loops in both directions while a third set of pointers allows to efficiently enumerate the vertices at a given lattice site .",
    "as we delete vertices ( free list entries ) in the retract step , we now immediately re - adjust all pointers including the site related ones .",
    "we have extensively run the algorithm just described and successfully reproduced numbers from the literature @xcite @xcite @xcite for small and intermediate lattices ( @xmath134 in @xmath2 , @xmath135 ) with permille errors using only moderate pc time . as for the o(@xmath3 ) simulations in @xcite",
    "we have found that integrated autocorrelation times _ in units of iterations _ typically stay below one in our timeseries of @xmath136 iterations .",
    "there nevertheless is a problem that is exacerbated here compared to o(@xmath3 ) .",
    "the moves described above seem to be superficially local with a fixed number of operations around @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "for the reconnect ii we have to know however if the 2-vertex that has been randomly chosen is part of a passive or an active loop , which represents nonlocal information that is locally available to us in the flag entry of the list @xcite . the price to pay for this",
    "is that whenever sections of loops are detached or eaten up , these have to re - flagged .",
    "it turns out that thus , close to the continuum limit on large lattices , most of the cpu time is spent travelling around loops resetting flags .",
    "this problem was already discussed in @xcite .",
    "it is more severe for cp(@xmath0 ) than for o(@xmath3 ) because the loops are more numerous and probably longer for comparable correlation lengths and lattice sizes .    to diagnose the problem in more detail we have measured the loop - size distribution @xmath137 where the expectation value @xmath138 refers to the closed ` vacuum ' graphs only .",
    "further we have introduced and implemented the decomposition of each such graph @xmath61 into individual closed loops @xmath139 of lengths ( number of link - lines ) @xmath140 . in @xcite , inspired by percolation and random walk theory , the asymptotic scaling form @xmath141 has been proposed introducing the loop tension @xmath7 and a power correction exponent @xmath142 .",
    "we found that such a fit describes reasonably well data that we have generated with @xmath73 at @xmath135 for correlations lengths @xmath143 and size @xmath144 .",
    "our aim here was not a high precision estimation of @xmath7 and @xmath142 .",
    "a clean assessment of their systematic errors would require quite some effort as it depends on the chosen fit window and their mutual correlation .",
    "we content ourselves at present with quoting that our analysis suggests that our data are roughly described by @xmath145 if we now pick a random 2-vertex we hit long loops more frequently and it will be part of a loop of length @xmath146 with a probability proportional to @xmath147 . the cost to re - flag such a loop will hence on average be @xmath148 because @xmath149 grows roughly proportional to the _ squared correlation length _ in the continuum limit ( ` fractal dimension two ' ) simulations with the r algorithm slow down asymptotically in a way similar to ordinary local methods .",
    "it is to be noted that this section of the code ( the re - flag while - loop ) is very simple and thus dominates on larger lattices only , and that loop simulations still have great advantages .",
    "in any case we have found that the cpu time per site for r grew roughly by a factor 60 as the correlation length and @xmath150 are scaled up by a factor 7 .",
    "slower memory access on larger lattices may however also have entered here to some degree .      to proceed it was instructive to draw some analogies to fortuin - kastelyn cluster based algorithms for the @xmath109-state potts model . in an early proposal sweeny @xcite",
    "has worked with bond variables only .",
    "the boltzmann weight then contains a factor @xmath151 , where @xmath152 is the number of percolation clusters implied by the bond configuration .",
    "it resembles our weight @xmath153 , for instance by allowing to analytically continue in @xmath109 . during a local bond update nonlocal information",
    "is required : does the status of the single bond change @xmath152 or not ?",
    "this leads to the same kind of slowing down .",
    "sweeny has designed a system of hierarchical express pointers to accelerate the travel around loops ( like express trains of the new york subway ) .",
    "one could consider such an improvement also for r here .",
    "a much simpler solution of the problem was however the one of swendsen and wang @xcite .",
    "they keep spin _ and _ bond variables and update them in alternating order .",
    "one may actually view the cluster - wise assigned spins as just a device to stochastically dissolve the nonlocal weight into local steps . transferring this technique to our problem at hand we insert , for example in ( [ zloop ] ) ,",
    "the representation @xmath154 here the enlarged phase space now consists of graphs @xmath61 where each loop @xmath155 contained in it carries a label @xmath156 that is freely summed over @xmath3 values .",
    "the update is extended now to such configurations including a choice for all @xmath156 . in the last ( primed )",
    "sum we omit @xmath157 assignments where the indices of the two active loops coincide .",
    "the reason for this small extra twist will become clear soon .",
    "the loop partition function now reads for example @xmath71 = \\frac{n}{n - 1 } \\sum_{\\lambda \\in    \\mathcal{l}_2^ { } } { \\sum_{\\alpha } } ' \\rho^{- 1 } ( u - v ) w [ \\lambda ]    \\label{zloopi}\\ ] ] and expectation values in this ensemble are formed in the obvious way .",
    "the simulation of the ensemble including the @xmath157 values requires only minimal changes .",
    "the flag entries of the linked list are rededicated to now store the flavor values @xmath158 of each vertex that is inherited from the loop to which it belongs .",
    "the extend / retract step i is completely unchanged , flavor is just passed on in extensions .",
    "the re - route step ii ( at fixed @xmath157 ) becomes even simpler now and proceeds as follows :    * if @xmath159 and @xmath117 holds we pick one of the 2-vertices at @xmath49 . if it carries the same flavor as the initial 1-vertex of the @xmath55 loop we ( always ) swap in the way described before , otherwise nothing is done . then the same is repeated for @xmath56 loop at @xmath49 .    because of the restriction @xmath160 it never happens that a re - route now leads to a line connecting for example @xmath161 with @xmath162 , a contribution not included in our definition of the class @xmath163 or @xmath62 designed such that @xmath164 map out the _ adjoint _ correlation .",
    "the larger class would lead to a correlation with a singlet part decaying to a known constant instead of zero .",
    "it could be canceled but we would presumably be left with more and unnecessary noise .    for ergodicity",
    "we also have to periodically update the flavor assignments after a certain number of the steps just discussed .",
    "we expect the cost for one iteration to remain o(@xmath165 ) if we do this only after o(@xmath165 ) extend / retract steps .",
    "one obvious option for these new steps would be to identify all loops @xmath155 in @xmath61 ( including @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) and re - flavor them randomly .",
    "some thought shows however that for ergodicity it is already sufficient to only randomly re - flavor the two active loops to one of the @xmath166 pairs @xmath160 .",
    "we call this type of re - flavor step now iii . some short experiments identified the following combination as quite efficient @xmath167^n .\\ ] ] in particular our experiments have shown that it is _ not _ profitable to re - flavor all loops . most important",
    ", it was quite pleasant to find that the errors of relevant observables grow only by 10% or so if they are accumulated during the same number of such i - iterations replacing the much more costly r - iterations . a more detailed discussion of autocorrelations and ( the absence of ) critical slowing down will follow in the next section .",
    "we here report data on a number of simulations in @xmath2 dimensions .",
    "the reason for this restriction is that physical interest in the cp(@xmath0 ) models and hence available data seem to be concentrated on this dimensionality .",
    "we expect our new formulation and algorithms to be generalizable to other dimensions without problems .",
    "we have implemented the algorithms r and i as c codes .",
    "the graphs @xmath61 are encoded into a linked list as described in detail in @xcite . in c",

    "for the numerical simulation an important refinement was necessary to avoid critical slowing down in the cp(@xmath209 ) case : the stochastic rather then exact treatment of the weight @xmath210 where @xmath65 is the number of closed loops in an arbitrary strong coupling graph .",
    "the exact algorithm could still be used to simulate the theory also at non - integer @xmath3 , if desired , although with accepting some critical slowing down .",
    "one of the main reasons to invent and study the cp(@xmath0 ) models was their analogy with yang - mills theory in four dimensions with regard to both asymptotic freedom and the existence of an integer winding number . as we have argued that the loop model is an exact representation of the original model the observables related to topology should possess an image in the loop model .",
    "we have constructed the effect of the term in the action related to the @xmath7 parameter .",
