    "during the last years there was an experimental effort [ @xcite]-[@xcite ] to confirm non - zero contributions of sea strange quark - antiquark pairs to the structure of nucleons , which are built by nonstrange up and down quarks .",
    "the results of those experiments were values of the nucleon strange electric and magnetic form factors ( ff s ) , or of their combinations at nonzero values of the four - momentum transfer squared @xmath7 .",
    "on the other hand there are various theoretical approaches [ @xcite]-[@xcite]in the framework of which one can predict strange electric and magnetic or strange dirac and pauli ff s of nucleons .",
    "one of these approaches [ @xcite ] utilizing the unitary and analytic models of electromagnetic ( em ) structure of hadrons [ @xcite ] , appeared in a description of the scarce experimental information on nucleons to be successful and it can be directly extended also to the pseudoscalar - meson transition ff s @xmath8 .",
    "the idea consists in the following .",

    "we review briefly the unitary and analytic model of em pseudoscalar - meson transition ff s .",
    "the section 3 is devoted to a prediction of behaviours of strange - quark vector current pseudoscalar - meson transition ff s . in the last section we present conclusions and discussion",
    "the em pseudoscalar - meson transition ff s are understood to be functions @xmath25 describing any @xmath26 transition , where @xmath27 can be @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 . only recently",
    "a progress in the em pseudoscalar - meson transition ff s was achieved [ @xcite ] thanks to the sophisticated unitary and anlytic model of em structure of hadrons [ @xcite ] and an appearance of a new experimental information , especially in the time - like region [ @xcite ] .",
    "there is a single ff for each @xmath31 transition to be defined by a parametrization of the matrix element of the em current @xmath32 @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the polarization vector of the photon @xmath35 , @xmath36 appears as only the pseudoscalar - meson belongs to the abnormal spin - parity series .",

    "the strange - quark vector current pseudoscalar - meson transition ff s @xmath65 can be defined analogically to ( [ a2 ] ) by the parametrization @xmath66 where @xmath67=@xmath68 is the strange - quark vector current .",
    "since the isospin of the strange quark @xmath69 is zero , then the strange - quark vector current pseudoscalar - meson transition ff s @xmath65 can contribute only to the isoscalar parts of @xmath25 , from where it directly follows that @xmath65 are saturated ( unlike @xmath25 ) only by isoscalar vector - mesons .",
    "however , since the total strangeness of @xmath27 and @xmath35 is zero , then their normalizations take the form @xmath70    the asymptotic behaviours of the strange pseudoscalar - meson transition ff s are @xmath71 as there are another two @xmath72 quarks contributing to the structure of @xmath27 .",
    "analytic properties of @xmath65 are identical with analytic properties of @xmath73 .",
    "taking into account all the abovementioned properties in a construction of the unitary and analytic models of @xmath14 we start with the corresponding vmd parametrization @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a coupling of the strangeness current to vector meson @xmath76=@xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath77 and we use the ff denotation @xmath78 as it has still the vmd asymptotic behaviour .",
