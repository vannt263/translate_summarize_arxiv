    "time series is a ( stochastic ) process defined on natural numbers which is understood as a discretization of a process defined on real ( positive ) numbers , i.e. the discretization is defined by the injection @xmath1 . in the present paper we consider real and complex valued stochastic processes .",
    "the alternative way to obtain time series from a process @xmath2 of a real argument is to use averaging , i.e. to consider the process @xmath3 , @xmath4 ( we use the agreement that natural numbers contain zero ) of the form @xmath5    in the present paper we propose the following approach to investigation of time series .",

    "recall that @xmath0-adic numbers are in one to one correspondence with series @xmath12    we will investigate the correspondence between processes with real and @xmath0-adic arguments using the monna map which maps @xmath0-adic numbers onto positive half  line surjectively @xmath13 @xmath14 the monna map is 1-lipshitz , i.e. @xmath15 , and therefore transforms large @xmath0-adic distances to large real distances .",
    "this map conserves the measure ( i.e. maps @xmath0-adic balls to real intervals with the same measure , where we use the haar measure on @xmath6 with the normalization in which the unit ball has a measure one ) .",
    "moreover this map gives a one to one correspondence between the set of natural numbers @xmath16 and the group of residues @xmath17 , where the group of residues is understood as the group of fractions @xmath18 ( i.e. elements of @xmath6 ) with addition modulo one .",
    "we introduce the discretization of functions of @xmath0-adic argument using the homomorphism map @xmath19 .",

    "after the application of the monna map this @xmath0-adic discretization procedure reduces to the discretization of functions of positive argument using the formula ( [ averaging ] ) .    in the present text",

    "stochastic process with the correlation function of the above form can be considered as a model of sandpile avalanche processes @xcite and punctuated equilibrium , similar to applied for the description of biological evolution in @xcite .",
    "recall that punctuated equilibrium is the property of biological evolution when the species are generally stable and in some short time periods perform considerable reorganizations , moreover , evolution of one specie triggers the evolution of ecologically related species .",
    "it was proposed to describe punctuated equilibrium by avalanches in a sandpile , where an avalanche triggers other avalanches .    in our model punctuated equilibrium",
    "is a result of the structure of time  the time is @xmath0-adic with totally disconnected topology , we consider the time as a real parameter by application of the monna map @xmath91 . after this operation locally constant functions of @xmath0-adic parameter become piecewise continuous functions of real parameter .",
    "the power @xmath199 in the correlator becomes a kind of punctuated power function .",
    "our model may be used to support the argument that the biological time need not be directly represented by real numbers .",
    "thus the biological evolution is in fact continuous and only usage of the physical time makes the impression of evolutionary discontinuity .",
    "we shall elaborate this idea in more detail somewhere else .    as was emphasized the stochastic processes with the correlation function of the above form",
    "can be considered as a model of sandpile avalanche processes .",
    "this model can also be applied to modeling of time series obtained as the result of measurement of pressure in oil wells where a spike in pressure generates a cascade of pressure spikes .",
    "the cascade processes have the internal hierarchic and hence multi - fractal structure .",
    "the rings of @xmath0-adic integers @xmath74 are examples of fractals endowed with the algebraic structure and the metric topology .",
    "these features provide the unique possibility to develop analysis and methods for analytic calculations .",
    "thus , although usage of @xmath0-adics means the lost of generality in application of the fractal approach , it gives the possibility to find exact analytic answers , as , e.g. , the correlation function which was calculated in this paper .",
    "with a view to wavelet applications for physical and geophysical signals and images decomposition during their processing , some interesting constructions with linear non - commuting operators @xmath201 ( the essential compatibility condition is that the operators form a partition of unity ) and , therefore , _ non - abelian cuntz algebra _ , was designed by jorgensen @xcite , @xcite in order to select the wavelet packets from libraries of bases .",
    "the author consider that these are constructions which make a selection of a basis with the best frequency concentration in signal or data compression problem and , which are especially useful for multi - resolution analysis of complex systems @xcite , @xcite . from our point of view , this technique is more comparable with our @xmath0-adic modeling .",
    "a structure theorem was proven by jorgensen for certain classes of induced scalar measures on the set @xmath202 which in the case of applications may be the unit interval , or a cantor set ( dutkay and jorgensen @xcite ) , or an affine fractal etc .",
