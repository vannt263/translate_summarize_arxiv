    "one of the most interesting recent developments in heavy - quarkonium phenomenology is the introduction of a new technique for resumming relativistic corrections to @xmath0-wave quarkonium production and decay rates .",
    "the technique resums corrections to all orders in the heavy - quark velocity @xmath8 in the heavy - quark - antiquark ( @xmath9 ) rest frame  @xcite within the color - singlet mechanism of the nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics ( nrqcd ) factorization approach  @xcite . with the method , the relative - order-@xmath4 nrqcd matrix element for the @xmath0-wave charmonium , which has",
    "a power - ultraviolet divergence and needs subtraction , has been evaluated with improved accuracy  @xcite compared with lattice calculations  @xcite and with the determination  @xcite obtained by using the gremm - kapustin relation  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the generalized version of the gremm - kapustin relation within the cornell potential model  @xcite was derived .",
    "the generalized gremm - kapustin relation allows one to resum a class of relativistic corrections in a potential - model color - singlet @xmath9 wave function .",
    "the resummation method has also been applied to determine leading - order nrqcd matrix elements for the @xmath10 charmonium states .",
    "the resultant values for the matrix elements are significantly greater than those known previously  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the method has provided a reasonable solution  @xcite to the long - standing puzzle of the cross section for @xmath11 measured at the @xmath12-factories  @xcite , which has been one of the greatest discrepancies between theory and experiment within the standard model .",
    "therefore , it is worthwhile to extend this method to study radially excited @xmath0-wave charmonia , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and spin - triplet @xmath0-wave bottomonia , @xmath7 , with radial quantum numbers @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",

    ", we compute derived quantities for various values of the model parameter of the cornell potential model for @xmath0-wave heavy quarkonia with radial quantum numbers @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "the cornell potential is a linear combination of the coulomb and linear potentials .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we rescale the schrdinger equation and solve the equation numerically for various values of the model parameter @xmath14 , which determines the strength of the coulomb potential relative to the linear potential .",
    "to achieve improved accuracies in calculating energy eigenvalues , we use the numerical method given in refs .",
    "the potential - model parameters and derived quantities are listed as functions of @xmath14 .",
    "these parameters are ready for use to determine leading and relative - order-@xmath4 color - singlet nrqcd matrix elements for both @xmath0-wave charmonia and bottomonia .",

    "in order to compute leading and higher - order color - singlet nrqcd matrix elements for an @xmath0-wave heavy quarkonium with the radial quantum number @xmath1 , @xmath2 , or @xmath3 , we need to compute the binding energy @xmath15 of the @xmath16 state that appears in the generalized gremm - kapustin relation  @xcite . in this section , we describe briefly the cornell potential model  @xcite that we use to compute @xmath15 .",
    "we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite which contain more complete descriptions of the model in conjunction with the nrqcd factorization formalism and the resummation technique for relativistic corrections to quarkonium processes .",
    "we employ the cornell potential  @xcite , which parametrizes the @xmath17 potential @xmath18 as a linear combination of the coulomb and linear potentials : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a model parameter for the coulomb strength and @xmath21 is the string tension .",
    "the relation between the string tension @xmath21 and the corresponding parameter @xmath22 in the original formulation of the cornell potential model @xcite is @xmath23 . by varying the parameters in the cornell potential",
    ", one can obtain good fits to lattice measurements of the @xmath17 static potential @xcite .",
    "therefore , we assume that the use of the cornell parametrization of the @xmath17 potential should result in errors that are much less than the order-@xmath4 errors ( about 30% for a charmonium and about 10% for a bottomonium ) that are inherent in the leading - potential approximation to nrqcd  @xcite .    the schrdinger equation for the @xmath0-wave radial wave function @xmath24 with the radial quantum number @xmath25 is @xmath26r_{ns}(r)=\\epsilon_{ns } r_{ns}(r ) , \\label{radial}%\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the quark mass and @xmath15 is the binding energy for the @xmath16 state . the model parameter @xmath27 is distinguished from the heavy - quark mass @xmath28 that appears in the short - distance coefficients of nrqcd factorization formulas . for an @xmath0-wave state , the wave function is @xmath29 .",

    "the ratio of the relative - order-@xmath4 nrqcd matrix element to the leading - order one is proportional to @xmath45 .",
    "the electromagnetic decay rate for the quarkonium , in which relativistic corrections to all orders in @xmath8 are resummed , is expressed in terms of these nrqcd matrix elements  @xcite . because @xmath44 , @xmath41 , and @xmath45 depend on @xmath14 , the decay rate is completely determined by @xmath14 .",
