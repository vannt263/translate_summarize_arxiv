    "in 1966 , jenkins and serrin @xcite studied the problem of finding necessary and sufficient conditions in a bounded domain in @xmath1 in order to solve the dirichlet problem for the minimal surface equation with certain infinite boundary data .",
    "more precisely , they considered domains @xmath2 bounded by arcs @xmath3 @xmath4 of curvature zero and arcs @xmath5 of non negative curvature ( normal pointing inwards ) , and wanted to find a function @xmath6 that satisfies the minimal surface equation and assumes @xmath7 on the arcs @xmath8 s , @xmath9 on @xmath10 s and a bounded prescribed data on the arcs @xmath11 s .",
    "they gave necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a solution on @xmath12 in terms of the length of the boundary arcs of @xmath12 and of inscribed polygons .",
    "later , spruck @xcite considered the same problem for mean curvature @xmath13 in this case it is natural to expect that the arcs @xmath8 and @xmath10 be of curvature @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively , since a solution would be asymptotic to a vertical cylinder of mean curvature @xmath16 the existence result for infinite boundary data could be thought to be proved by taking a limit of @xmath17 in a sequence of solutions that take the boundary data @xmath18 on @xmath8 and @xmath19 on @xmath20 nevertheless , the existence of bounded solutions is only guaranteed for convex domains .",
    "an important idea introduced in @xcite was to consider reflected arcs of the family @xmath21 in order to get a convex domain .",
    "after those results many people have worked on these problems in other ambient spaces , specially in other homogeneous spaces .",
    "for instance , in @xmath22 the minimal case ( @xmath23 ) was considered by nelli and rosenberg @xcite ( for bounded domains ) and by collin and rosenberg @xcite ( for unbounded domains ) ; and the mean curvature @xmath24 case was treated by hauswirth , rosenberg and spruck @xcite ( for bounded domains ) and folha and melo @xcite ( for unbounded domains ) . for other jenkins - serrin type results",
    "see , for instance , @xcite .",
    "each of the ambient spaces where the problem has already been treated admits an unitary killing vector field that gives a vertical direction to define graphs .",
    "this is no longer true in sol@xmath25 recently , nguyen @xcite considered the minimal case for both bounded and unbounded domains in sol@xmath0 and presented a warped product model of the space where vertical graphs can be considered .",
    "recall that sol@xmath0 can be viewed as @xmath26 endowed with the riemannian metric @xmath27 as described in @xcite , sol@xmath0 admits exactly two foliations by totally geodesic submanifolds , the two being similar . in both foliations ,",
    "each leaf is isometric to the hyperbolic plane @xmath28 the approach in @xcite was to consider one of this foliations by applying the change of coordinates @xmath29 that turned sol@xmath0 into the model of a warped product , in fact , sol@xmath30 where the half - plane model is used for @xmath31 and the riemannian metric is given by @xmath32 seeing sol@xmath0 as a warped product gives us a natural way to define functions in @xmath33 and consider their graphs in sol@xmath25    there are two interesting properties about this model for sol@xmath0 : the vertical lines are not geodesics and the mean curvature vector of a vertical plane generated by a curve @xmath34 is related to its euclidean geodesic curvature .",
    "in fact , if @xmath34 is a curve in @xmath35 then the mean curvature vector @xmath36 of the vertical plane @xmath37 in sol@xmath0 is @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the euclidean geodesic curvature vector of the curve . hence the conditions on the boundary of a given domain can be formulated in terms of the euclidean geodesic curvature of the arcs of the boundary .",
    "recall that sol@xmath0 is the thurston geometry of smallest isometry group which has dimension three and has no rotation .",
    "a consequence of the lack of isometries is that the reflected arcs idea from @xcite described above does not make sense in sol@xmath0 and therefore a definition of admissible domain for the case @xmath24 will be more delicate . in this paper",
    "we will work on this problem .",
    "we briefly describe our main results .",
    "first , let us give an idea of what is an admissible domain in our context ( definition [ def - admsdomain ] ) and set some notation .",
    "a bounded domain is said to be admissible if it is bounded by @xmath40 open arcs @xmath41 @xmath21 and @xmath42 and their endpoints , with euclidean curvature @xmath43 @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively , and if the family @xmath21 is non empty , a special domain @xmath46 must be well defined .",
    "we require @xmath12 and @xmath46 to be simply connected and admit a bounded subsolution to the mean curvature pde .",
    "besides , a polygon @xmath47 is said to be an admissible polygon if it is a curvilinear polygon whose sides are curves of euclidean curvature @xmath48 and vertices are chosen from among the endpoints of arcs of the families @xmath49 and @xmath50 for an admissible polygon @xmath51 we denote by @xmath52 and @xmath53 the total euclidean lengths of the arcs in the boundary @xmath54 that belong to @xmath49 and @xmath55 respectively , and by @xmath56 the perimeter of @xmath57 we consider the quantity @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the euclidean area element .    our main results about existence of solutions to the dirichlet problem for cmc surfaces with boundary data as described before are the following .",
    "[ teo - bempty ] let @xmath12 be an admissible domain such that the family @xmath21 is empty .",
    "assume that the assigned boundary data on the arcs @xmath42 is bounded below .",
    "then the dirichlet problem has a solution in @xmath12 if and only if @xmath60 for all admissible polygons @xmath61    if the family @xmath49 is empty , an analogous result holds .",
    "[ teo - aempty ] let @xmath12 be an admissible domain such that the family @xmath49 is empty .",
    "assume that the assigned boundary data on the arcs @xmath42 is bounded above .",
    "then the dirichlet problem has a solution in @xmath12 if and only if @xmath62 for all admissible polygons @xmath61    the next result combines the two above for the case of the family @xmath42 being empty .",
    "[ teo - cempty ] let @xmath12 be an admissible domain such that the family @xmath42 is empty .",
    "then the dirichlet problem has a solution in @xmath12 if and only if @xmath63 and for all admissible polygons properly contained in @xmath64 @xmath65    after studying these results a natural question arises : are there domains for which they apply ? what can be said about them ? in section [ existencedomains ]",
    "we construct admissible domains where theorems [ teo - bempty ] and [ teo - aempty ] apply and in section [ sec - exemplo ] we exhibit a method to find domains with no @xmath42-type arcs that admit a solution to the dirichlet problem .",
    "one of the main difficulty in this problem was to find the right conditions on the boundary of the domains to be considered and understand the properties of horizontal curves whose product by the vertical line has constant mean curvature .",
    "we remark that the arguments presented here also apply for other warped products .",
    "in this section we will describe the model that we use for sol@xmath0 and will state some results . for more details and proofs see , for instance , section 2 in @xcite .",
    "the homogeneous riemannian @xmath66manifold sol@xmath0 is a lie group which can be viewed as @xmath67 with the metric .",
    "a change of coordinates allows us to treat sol@xmath0 as a warped product , context in which much is known about constant mean curvature surfaces that are graphs .",
    "the diffeomorphism @xmath68 given by @xmath69 is an isometry if @xmath31 is considered with the half - plane model @xmath70 with metric @xmath71 and @xmath72 so that the warped metric is @xmath73    notice that @xmath74 and vertical translations are isometries . in particular",
    ", @xmath75 is a killing vector field that is not unitary and vertical lines are not geodesics .    in this model ,",
    "euclidean properties of curves @xmath34 in the half - plane are transmitted to the hypersurface @xmath76 for example :    let @xmath34 be a curve in @xmath77 then the mean curvature vector of @xmath37 in sol@xmath0 is @xmath38 where @xmath78 is the euclidean curvature vector of @xmath79 [ prop_h ]    let @xmath12 be a domain in @xmath31 and denote by @xmath80 the graph of a function @xmath81 over @xmath82 the upward unit normal vector to @xmath80 is given by @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the hyperbolic gradient operator and @xmath85 is the hyperbolic norm .",

    "if @xmath81 satisfies ( [ eq - cmc ] ) , @xmath81 is called a solution in @xmath82    let @xmath12 be a domain in @xmath31 and @xmath90 be a @xmath91function over @xmath82    1 .",

    "we start this section by stating a local lemma ( whose proof can be found in @xcite , lemma 3.4 ) and a general maximum principle for sub and super solutions of the mean curvature equation for boundary data with a finite number of discontinuities ( whose proof is analogous to the proof of theorem 2.2 in @xcite ) .",

    "it has two important consequences for this work : the harnack inequality ( theorem [ theo - harnack ] ) and the compactness theorem ( theorem [ theo - compact ] ) .",
