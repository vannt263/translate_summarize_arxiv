    "precise astronomical data coming from recent observational missions  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) support the existence of an extremely short and intense stage of accelerated expansion in the early universe ( inflation ) , as well as of a long - lasting accelerated phase at present .",
    "these results set important restrictions on existing inflationary models  @xcite ( see also  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "moreover , these observational data give strong support to the fact that the post - inflationary universe was nearly homogeneous , isotropic and spatially flat , at very large distances or short times .",
    "presently , the evolution of our universe can be well described in terms of a spatially flat friedmann ",
    "lematre  robertson  walker ( flrw ) background and cosmological perturbations and models with scalar fields are very well suited to describe an evolution of this kind .",
    "it has also been proven that some modified gravity models , as @xmath2 gravity , can in a sense be considered as generic general relativity models with additional scalar fields .",
    "this is the reason why scalar fields play such an essential role in modern cosmology ; in particular , in the current description of the evolution of the universe at a very early epoch  @xcite .",
    "many inflationary models involve scalar fields nonminimally coupled to the ricci curvature scalar  @xcite .",
    "note , however , that predictions of the simplest inflationary models with minimal couplings to scalar fields , as the @xmath3 model , are actually in sharp disagreement with the planck2013 results  @xcite , and that some of these inflationary scenarios had to be improved by adding a tiny nonminimal coupling of the inflaton field to gravity  @xcite .",
    "the conditions for a model to be consistent with the bicep2 result have been examined in many papers already ( see , e.g.,@xcite ) . and",
    "it is in fact possible to reconstruct models with minimally coupled scalar fields which realize an inflation compatible with the planck and the bicep2 results , by using , e.g. , the algorithm proposed in  @xcite .    also a very crucial issue is the possibility to describe inflation using particle physics models  @xcite , as the standard model of elementary particles  @xcite or some other quantum field theory , as supersymmetric models  @xcite or non - supersymmetric grand unified theories ( guts )  @xcite .",
    "this is a fundamental step towards the longstanding and very ambitious program of the unification of physics at all scales .    as a very important step towards this goal",
    ", one should not forget to take into account quantum effects of quantum field theories in curved space - time at the inflationary epoch ( see  @xcite for a general introduction ) .",
    "it is well understood that quantum guts in curved space - time lead also to curvature induced phase transitions ( for a complete description , see  @xcite ) .",
    "note moreover that curvature induced phase transitions , as discussed in  @xcite , may be described with better accuracy when one considers this phenomena within renormalization - group improved effective potentials ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , in this case , the summation of all leading logs is done and the corresponding rg - improved effective potential goes far beyond the one - loop approximation .",
    "these phase transitions are very important in early - universe cosmology .",
    "specifically , some models of the inflationary universe  @xcite are based on first - order phase transitions , which took place during the reheating phase of the universe in the grand unification epoch  @xcite .",
    "also , curved space - time effects in the grand unification epoch can not be dismissed , simply considered to be negligible .",
    "quite on the contrary , all these theories should be treated as quantum field theories in curved space - time , as discussed some time ago in  @xcite .",
    "indeed , it must be properly emphasized that the recent results by the bicep2 collaboration  @xcite point clearly towards the gut scale , what is a very impressive hint of a probably deep connection of inflation with the gut epoch and a validation of the arguments in paper  @xcite .",
    "as was emphasized there , guts corresponding to the very early universe ought to be treated as quantum field theories in curved space - time , in a proper and rigorous way .    anyhow , in the lack of a clear prescription for how to combine quantum field theory at non - zero temperature and quantum field theory in curved space - time ( external temperature and external gravitational field ) , it is natural to start by addressing just the second part of this problem .",
    "the renormalization - group improved effective potential for an arbitrary renormalizable massless gauge theory in curved space - time was discussed in  @xcite , working in the linear curvature approximation , because at least these linear curvature terms ought to be taken into account in the discussion of the effective potential corresponding to guts in the early universe .",
    "quantum corrections with account to gravity effects are predicted to be even more important in a chaotic inflationary model  @xcite . by generalizing the coleman ",
    "weinberg approach corresponding to the case of the effective potential in flat space - time , the authors found , at a first instance , the explicit form of the renormalization group ( rg ) improved effective potential in curved space for scalar electrodynamics , the finite @xmath0 model , the @xmath0 gauge model , and the @xmath1 gut model .",
    "the possibility of corresponding curvature - induced phase transitions was also investigated .    by carrying out one - loop calculations in a weak gravitational field",

    "we have got that these models are in good agreement with the most recent observational data  @xcite provided some reasonable values are taken for the parameters .",
