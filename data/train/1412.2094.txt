    "the current best limit has been obtained in the lsnd experiment @xcite    @xmath17    in the case of the electric dipole moment @xmath18 @xcite the best limits are :    @xmath19    the most general expression consistent with lorentz and electromagnetic gauge invariance , for the tau - neutrino electromagnetic vertex may be parameterized in terms of four form factors :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the charge of the electron , @xmath22 is the mass of the tau - neutrino , @xmath23 is the photon momentum , and @xmath24 are the electromagnetic form factors of the neutrino , corresponding to charge radius , magnetic moment ( mm ) , electric dipole moment ( edm ) and anapole moment ( am ) , respectively , at @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the form factors corresponding to charge radius and the anapole moment , do not concern us here .",
    "the current best limit on @xmath26 has been obtained in the borexino experiment which explores solar neutrinos .",

    "not only can the future @xmath32 linear collider be designed to operate in @xmath32 collision mode , but it can also be operated as a @xmath33 and @xmath34 collider .",
