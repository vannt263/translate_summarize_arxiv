    "the studying of the evolution of elementary particles systems with mixing is an important problem of high energy physics .",
    "nowadays we have received the experimental confirmation that there exists the mixing in the lepton sector of the standard model ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) which leads to the transitions between different neutrino flavors , i.e. to neutrino flavor oscillations .",
    "recently considerable efforts were made to theoretically describe the evolution of flavor neutrinos with mixing in order to substantiate the results of the quantum mechanical approach to the problem in question ( see ref .",
    "the issue of the description of neutrino flavor oscillations with help of field theory methods is important since some problems arise when the quantum mechanics is used to describe neutrino oscillations .",
    "for instance , it is not clear ( i ) whether energies or momenta of different neutrino eigenstates are equal , ( ii ) whether neutrino oscillations occur in space or in time , ( iii ) whether it is important to take into account the multicomponent structure of neutrino wave functions etc .",
    "some of the unresolved questions of the neutrino flavor oscillations problem are also briefly outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is necessary to mention that in refs .",
    "@xcite the quantum field theory was applied for the studying of neutrino flavor oscillations in vacuum . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors studied neutrino oscillations with the most general neutrino mass matrix and derived sum rules in neutrino oscillations .",
    "the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite discussed neutrino oscillations in a similar way as in ref .  @xcite . in those works",
    "the evolution of neutrino _ mass _ eigenstates was considered , i.e. one formulates neutrino oscillations problem _ without _ resort to _ flavor _ eigenstates .",
    "it should be noticed that , in a sense , the problem of neutrino flavor oscillations is incorrectly formulated because in various processes where a neutrino participates , emitted particles can belong to several neutrino generations .",
    "for example , together with muon neutrinos in a pion decay , a small number of electron neutrinos is produced ( see also sec .  [ conclusion ] ) .",
    "hence we should rewrite neutrino emission and detection vertices in terms of _ mass _ eigenstates .",
    "then we can examine neutrino emission and detection processes by studying incoming and outgoing charged leptons as in refs .",
    "these particles are not mixed and thus they can serve as properly defined _ in _ and _ out _ states .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the corrections to the quantum mechanical transition probability formula were obtained when the evolution of fock states of flavor neutrinos was examined . in ref .  @xcite it was demonstrated that neutrino oscillations can be described in terms of entangled flavor states .",
    "several processes involving neutrino weak states , constructed in ref .",
    "@xcite , were calculated in ref .",
    "the incompatible results were revealed to appear if one uses the inequivalent vacua model proposed in ref .",
    "the @xmath0-matrix approach was used in ref .",
    "@xcite to examine the coherence problem in neutrino flavor oscillations .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that neutrino oscillations could be suppressed in a gedanken experiment where a neutrino is produced in a crystal by a relativistic electron .",
    "neutrino flavor oscillations were analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite using the path integral method .",
    "finally it should be mentioned that various theoretical approaches to neutrino flavor oscillations were reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite which also contains the comprehensive bibliography .",
    "we demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that neutrino flavor oscillations in vacuum , in matter and in electromagnetic fields of various configurations could be described in frames of the relativistic quantum mechanics approach . in those works we formulated the initial condition problem and studied the _ time _ evolution of neutrino _ mass _ eigenstates using pauli - jordan function , or its analog taking into account an external field . as a result we received the transition probabilities depending on",
    "_ time_. therefore that method is the most natural generalization , which accounts for the coordinate dependence of neutrinos wave functions , of the quantum mechanical treatment of neutrino oscillations .",
    "the weakness of that approach consists in the fact that to obtain a stable oscillations picture one should prepare rather broad , in space , initial wave packet of a _ flavor _ neutrino .",
    "such initial conditions are very difficult to implement . in order to overwhelm that difficulty one has to consider more realistic models for neutrino emission processes .",
    "this paper continues the series of our publications on the theory of neutrino flavor oscillations .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to provide a deeper understanding of neutrino flavor oscillations in vacuum .",
    "we study the evolution of mixed scalar ( sec .",

    "[ spinor ] ) particles emitted by classical sources .",
    "we start from lorentz invariant lagrangians in @xmath1-dimensional space - time",
    ". therefore all the results are valid for arbitrary energies of emitted particles .",
    "the fields distributions of scalar and spinor particles exactly accounting for the external sources are obtained .",
    "then for the external fields with the specific time and coordinates dependences we derive the expressions for energy densities , for scalar fields , and intensities , for spinor fields .",
    "these quantities are examined in the limit of rapidly oscillating external fields .",
    "it is shown that the considered expressions coincide with the common formulae for transition and survival probabilities of neutrino flavor oscillations in vacuum .",

    "[ gmt ] we study the evolution of fermion fields with the general mass matrix and examine the appearance of antiparticles .",

    "it should be also noticed that the expressions for the probabilities depend on @xmath46 rather than on @xmath47 in contrast to our previous works  @xcite .",
    "note that the problem whether neutrino oscillations happen in space or in time was also discussed in ref .",
    "the similar coordinate dependence of the probabilities was obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite where the problem of neutrino oscillations in vacuum was studied .",
    "it was mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite that oscillations between active and sterile neutrinos are possible in case of the non - unitary matrix @xmath10 , i.e. the presence of only majorana mass terms is not sufficient for the existence of this kind of transitions .",
    "the situation is analogous to that considered in the pioneering work  @xcite where oscillations between neutrinos and antineutrinos were studied . in eq .",
    "we obtain that the probability to detect @xmath190 is suppressed by the factor @xmath208 .",
    "it was also mentioned in refs .",
    "in conclusion we mention that we studied the evolution of the systems of mixed particles emitted by classical sources .",
    "the cases of both scalar and spinor particles were considered .",
    "the fields distributions of particles were found for the arbitrary sources dependences on time and spatial coordinates . note that the expressions for the fields distributions were received directly from the lorentz invariant wave equations and",
    "thus they are valid for arbitrary energies of emitted particles .",
    "it should be also mentioned that all the calculations were carried out in @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "we demonstrated that the expressions for energy densities , in the scalar fields case , and intensities , in the spinor fields case , coincide with the usual transition and survival probabilities of neutrino flavor oscillations in vacuum derived within the quantum mechanical approach .",
    "since we study the process of neutrino oscillations on the basis of the field theory method we reproduce not only the quantum mechanical probabilities as the leading terms , but also one can derive the corrections to these expressions .",
    "it is known ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) that the pontecorvo formula for neutrino oscillations has the corrections @xmath209 , that are small for ultrarelativistic neutrinos . in the present work we showed that the analogous terms also appear in the expressions for probabilities [ see , e.g. , eqs .   and  ] . in addition , in sec .",
    "[ gmt ] we considered the possibility of the appearance of antiparticles in the initial particles beam .    in our previous works  @xcite we studied neutrino flavor oscillations in vacuum and in various external fields within the field theoretical approach . in those papers we solved the initial condition problem for the wave equations describing the evolution of neutrino _ mass _ eigenstates .",
    "to study the dynamics of the particles one should use pauli - jordan function as the green function for the considered initial condition problem . as a result we received the final wave functions corresponding to the time @xmath47 of the system evolution .",
    "it was shown that the corresponding probabilities to detect a _ flavor _",
    "neutrino coincide with usual probabilities of neutrino oscillations derived in the schrdinger equation approach .",
    "therefore we obtained that neutrino oscillations happen in time .",
    "the weakness of that method was that to get the stable oscillations picture , i.e. reproduce the pontecorvo formula , one should prepare very broad initial wave packet .",
    "physically it would correspond to a permanent , or rather long - continued , neutrino source .",
    "one can also treat neutrino flavor oscillations in vacuum describing the propagation of neutrino _ mass _ eigenstates as the internal lines in a feynman diagram  @xcite .",
    "thus a feynman propagator serves as a green function in that approach . in that method one replaces _ flavor",
    "_ eigenstates with _ mass _ eigenstates at the neutrino emission and detection points .",
    "it is possible to say that one describes neutrino oscillations without resort to flavor neutrinos .",
    "it was found that transition and survival probabilities depend on the distance between emission and detection points .",
    "although that approach seems to be quite natural it encounters some problems .",
    "for example , it is unclear ( i ) if different _",
    "mass _ eigenstates should have equal energies , ( ii ) if one loses coherence when the energy is measured with high accuracy , ( iii ) if the usual pontecorvo formula is unique because the non - standard oscillations formulae are possible in that approach ( see the criticism in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the present work we developed another approach to the neutrino flavor oscillations problem . in frames of our method we derived the coordinate dependent transition and survival probabilities .",
    "we examined the relaxation phenomena occurring when a neutrino signal arrives to a detector .",
    "it was revealed that the stable oscillations picture could be implemented if the time after the neutrino emission is much greater than the distance between a source and a detector .",
    "it means that the quantum mechanical transition probability formula is valid for a rather long - continued neutrino source .",
    "this result , in a sense , confirms the results of our previous works  @xcite ( see also above ) .",
    "note that one can come the similar conclusions basing on ref .",
    "@xcite where neutrino oscillations were studied on the basis of an exactly solvable model .",
    "the weakness of the present method is that in various processes where a neutrino participates , particles belonging to different flavors can be emitted ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for instance , there are the following decay channels of a charged pion : @xmath210 and @xmath211 . therefore in frames of our model",
    "the classical sources of both muon and electron neutrinos would correspond to this process .",
    "however the latter channel is suppressed by the factor @xmath212  @xcite .",
    "thus we can suppose that only one type of neutrino sources is presented .",
    "nevertheless one can formally consider the sources of all neutrino species in frames our method .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath111 of the sources should be taken either from the quantum field theory of the neutrino emission or from an experiment .",
    "note that neutrino flavor oscillations in the model with a source and a detector were described in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that paper",
    "the source of particles was also assumed to be spatially localized .",
    "however its time dependence was chosen to be gaussian that is different from our approach .",
    "summarizing we can say that our method for the description of the flavor neutrinos evolution can be useful when we have spatially localized neutrino sources which start to emit neutrinos at some moment of time .",
    "one of the possible examples is the neutrinos emission in a supernova explosion .",
    "the work has been supported by the academy of finland under the contract no .",
    "108875 and by the conicyt ( chile ) , programa bicentenario psd-91 - 2006 .",
    "the author is thankful to the russian science support foundation for a grant as well as to jukka maalampi ( university of jyvskyl ) and walter grimus ( university of vienna ) for helpful discussions .",
    "it is interesting to evaluate the inexactitude which is made when we approach to the limit @xmath50 in eq .  .",
    "let us discuss two functions @xmath213 these functions are proportional to @xmath41 in eqs .   and   respectively . in eqs .",
    "and   we use dimensionless parameters @xmath214 , @xmath215 , @xmath216 , @xmath217 and @xmath218 .    in case",
    "we study neutrinos , we get that @xmath219 in almost all realistic situations .",
    "for example , suppose we study a neutrino emitted in a supernova explosion is our galaxy .",
    "the typical distance is @xmath220 . taking @xmath221 and @xmath222",
    ", we receive that @xmath223 and @xmath224 .    basing on the analysis of sec .",
    "[ scalar ] we can rewrite eq .   as @xmath225 using the fact that @xmath226 , @xmath227 and the representation for the bessel function , @xmath228 we obtain for the function @xmath229 in eq .   the following expression : @xmath230\\rho y_m)+\\mathrm{ci}([\\gamma-1]\\rho y_m )      \\notag      \\\\      & +      \\mathrm{i }      [ \\mathrm{si}([\\gamma+1]\\rho y_m)+\\mathrm{si}([\\gamma-1]\\rho y_m ) ]    \\big\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath231 and @xmath232 are cosine and sine integrals . using the asymptotic expression , @xmath233",

    "note that this result remains valid for a particle with an arbitrary @xmath237 factor , i.e. rapid oscillations of the function @xmath229 will attenuate even for slow particles .",
