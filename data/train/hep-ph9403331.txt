    "the production of massive weak boson pairs ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 ) is an important physics topic at high energy hadron colliders",
    ". measurements of these processes are vital for testing the standard model ( sm ) and probing beyond it . in particular , these processes are important for elucidating the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism and for testing the triple weak boson coupling @xcite .",
    "futhermore , these processes are also backgrounds to new physics signals , for example , new heavy particles such as neutral and charged higgs bosons , techni - mesons , extra gauge bosons , squarks , and gluinos can all decay into weak boson pairs .",
    "it is therefore important to have precise calculations of hadronic weak boson pair production .",
    "these calculations should include the leptonic decays of the weak bosons since the weak bosons are identified via their leptonic decay products .",
    "the dominant production mechanism for weak boson pairs in hadronic collisions is via the quark - antiquark annihilation subprocess @xmath11 .",
    "the cross sections for hadronic @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 production were first calculated in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "tree level calculations of @xmath12  jets have been given for @xmath13 and @xmath14 in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 can also be produced via the gluon fusion subprocess @xmath15 , which proceeds via a quark box loop and is of order @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the cross section for the gluon fusion process is significant at supercollider energies due to the large gluon luminosity , but it never dominates the @xmath17 annihilation cross section .",
    "weak boson pairs can also be produced via the vector boson fusion process in which the incoming quarks radiate two vector bosons which subsequently scatter off each other @xcite .",
    "this process is mainly of interest as a source of higgs bosons , with the higgs boson appearing as an @xmath18-channel resonance .",
    "away from the higgs boson peak , the weak - boson fusion production rate is only a small fraction of the basic @xmath11 production rate .",
    "the qcd radiative corrections to hadronic @xmath8@xcite , @xmath9@xcite , and @xmath19@xcite production have recently been calculated for the case of real weak bosons in the final state .    in this paper , previous calculations of next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) @xmath8@xcite , @xmath9@xcite , and @xmath19@xcite production",
    "are extended to include the leptonic decays of the @xmath20- and/or @xmath2-bosons .",
    "since it is the decay products that are observed in an experiment , the inclusion of the leptonic decays in the calculation will make it much more useful for comparing with experimental data .",
    "futhermore , cuts can now be applied to the final state leptons , thus allowing one to mimic the experimental conditions .",
    "the angular distributions of the weak boson s decay products are especially important because they are effective spin analyzers for the vector bosons @xcite .",
    "they are also of crucial importance when one tries to distinguish the various sources of anomalous couplings in the three - boson vertex @xcite .",
    "the nlo qcd corrections will have a significant effect on the distributions of the final state leptons , especially at the lhc center of mass energy .",
    "the calculations presented here include the leptonic decays of the weak bosons in the narrow width approximation . in this approximation , non - resonance diagrams ( _ e.g. _ , the final state @xmath21 , which is formed by the production and decay of @xmath8 , can also be reached by the process @xmath22 with the subsequent radiation of a leptonically decaying @xmath2 [ @xmath23 from the electron line ) are not necessary to maintain gauge invariance .",
    "the calculations are done by using the monte carlo method for nlo calculations @xcite in combination with helicity amplitude methods @xcite .",
    "the monte carlo method for nlo calculations is very powerful because any number of observables can be calculated simultaneously by simply histogramming the quantities of interest , experimental acceptance cuts can easily be imposed on the calculation , and it is also possible to compute the nlo qcd corrections for exclusive channels , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath24  jet .",
    "helicity amplitude methods make cross section calculations tractable for processes involving a large number of tree level diagrams , futhermore , the leptonic decays of the weak bosons are trivial to implement at the amplitude level .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the formalism used in the calculations is described in sec .",
    "ii , numerical results for the tevatron and lhc center of mass energies are given in sec .",
    "iii , and summary remarks are given in sec .",
    "technical details of the calculation have been relegated to an appendix .",
    "next - to - leading - order calculations of hadronic @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 production have been presented for real weak bosons in the final state .",
    "these results are extended in this section to include the leptonic decays @xmath25 and @xmath26 @xmath27 .",
    "this section begins with a brief review of the nlo monte carlo formalism used in the calculation and concludes with a discussion of the incorporation of the leptonic decays .",
    "the calculations are done using the narrow width approximation for the leptonically decaying weak bosons .",
    "this simplifies the calculation greatly for two reasons .",
    "first of all , it is possible to ignore the contributions from non - resonance feynman diagrams without violating gauge invariance .",
    "an example of such a diagram is @xmath28 followed by @xmath29 , yielding the final state @xmath21 , which is the same final state produced by @xmath30 . secondly , in the narrow width approximation it is particularly easy to extend the nlo calculations of real weak boson pairs to include the leptonic decays of the @xmath20- and @xmath2-bosons .",
    "the nlo calculations of @xmath31 production include contributions from the square of the born diagrams , the interference between the born diagrams and the virtual one - loop diagrams , and the square of the real emission diagrams .",
    "( the feynman diagrams for the case of real weak bosons in the final state can be found in the original references . )",
    "the calculations have been done using a combination of analytic and monte carlo integration methods  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to isolate the soft and collinear singularities associated with the real emission subprocesses by partitioning phase space into soft , collinear , and finite regions .",
    "this is done by introducing theoretical soft and collinear cutoff parameters , @xmath32 and @xmath33 . using dimensional regularization  @xcite ,",
    "the soft and collinear singularities are exposed as poles in @xmath34 ( the number of space - time dimensions is @xmath35 with @xmath34 a small number ) .",
    "the infrared singularities from the soft and virtual contributions are then explicitly canceled while the collinear singularities are factorized and absorbed into the definition of the parton distribution functions .",
    "the remaining contributions are finite and can be evaluated in four dimensions .",
    "the monte carlo program thus generates @xmath36-body ( for the born and virtual contributions ) and @xmath37-body ( for the real emission contributions ) final state events .",
    "the @xmath36- and @xmath37-body contributions both depend on the cutoff parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 , however , when these contributions are added together to form a suitably inclusive observable , all dependence on the cutoff parameters cancels .",
    "the numerical results presented in this paper are insensitive to variations of the cutoff parameters .",
    "the formalism for @xmath4 hadronic weak boson pair production followed by leptonic decays of the weak bosons is summarized here .",
    "a detailed discussion about the incorporation of leptonic decays into a nlo calculation of a real weak boson pair can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the leptonic decay @xmath38 was incorporated into a nlo calculation of real @xmath39 production . basically , except for the virtual contribution , all the nlo contributions for real @xmath31 production have the form @xmath40 \\ > , \\label{eq : nloform}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the lowest order born contribution , @xmath42 is the quark - gluon vertex color factor , and @xmath43 is the strong running coupling .",
    "thus the leptonic decays can be incorporated by simply making the replacement @xmath44 in the formulas for nlo real @xmath31 production .",
    "the leptonic decays are particularly easy to incorporate when the calculation is done at the amplitude level ; the weak boson polarization vectors , @xmath45 , are simply replaced by the @xmath46 decay currents , @xmath47 , in the amplitude . details of the amplitude level calculations for the born and real emission subprocesses can be found in ref .",
    ".    the simple replacement described in the previous paragraph does not hold for the virtual corrections .",
    "rather than undertake the non - trivial task of recalculating the virtual corrections for the case of leptonically decaying weak bosons , we have instead opted to use the virtual corrections for real on - shell weak bosons which we subsequently decay ignoring spin correlations . neglecting spin correlations slightly modifies the shapes of the angular distributions of the final state leptons , but the total cross sections are not altered as long as no angular cuts ( _ e.g. _ , rapidity cuts ) are imposed on the final state leptons . for realistic rapidity cuts ,",
    "the total cross sections are changed by typically 10% when spin correlations are neglected . since the virtual corrections are small ( they are typically less than 10% as large as the corresponding born cross section ) and the effects of spin correlations are small , the overall result of ignoring spin correlations in the virtual corrections is negligible compared to the 20% ",
    "30% uncertainty from the parton distribution functions and the choice of the scale @xmath48 .",
    "( note that spin correlations are included everywhere in the calculations except in the virtual contributions . )",
    "the results for the nlo calculation of @xmath49 can now be summarized .",
