    "polarization measurements have been reported for a few @xmath1-ray bursts  such as grb 990510 ( covino et al . 1999 ; wijers et al . 1999 ) , grb 990712 ( rol et al . , 2000 ) , grb 011211 ( covino , et al .",
    "2002a ) grb 020813 ( barth et al . 2002 ; covino et al .",
    "2002b ) , and grb 021004 ( covino et al .",
    "2002c , 2002d , rol et al .",
    "a highly significant variation in the polarization level is observed for grb 020813 with constant polarization position angle .",
    "several models for @xmath1-ray burst  polarization have been proposed .",
    "gruzinov & waxman ( 1999 ) argued that if the magnetic field is globally random but with a large number of patches where the magnetic field is locally coherent , polarization of up to @xmath2 is expected , especially at early times .",
    "ghisellini & lazzati ( 1999 ) and sari ( 1999 ) considered a geometrical configuration in which a collimated fireball is observed slightly off - axis , and found that this break of symmetry results in significant polarization .",
    "grb  021004 was discovered by hete ii satellite at 12:06 ut on 2002 october 4 @xcite .",
    "prompt discovery of the optical transient by @xcite allowed rapid response of spectroscopic observations .",
    "@xcite obtained the first spectra and identified two intervening systems at z = 1.38 and 1.60 from and absorption .",
    "@xcite confirmed those features , noted several absorptions at these redshifts , and pointed out four absorption lines at @xmath3 4633 , 4664 , 5109 , and 5152   ( see also sahu et al .",
    "2002 ; castander et al .",
    "these were identified by @xcite as and features at red shift of @xmath4 .",
    "chornock & filippenko also identified ly@xmath5 emission at z = 2.323 and absorption components and perhaps ly@xmath6 at similar red shifts .",
    "@xcite identified four absorption components of at z = 2.295 , 2.298 , 2.230 and 2.237 , noting that the total spread is about 3000 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "the existence of various components in the lines shows that this @xmath1-ray burst  is associated with a star forming region and , very likely , is associated with the explosion of a massive star ( schaefer et al .",
    "2002 , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the lines could be formed in the wind of the progenitor , which could be an o star , or a wolf - rayet ( wr ) star which both show typical expansion velocities of the order of 1,000 to 3,000 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "alternatively , @xcite suggested that the lines could be produced in a supernova shell that preceeded the explosion by several months .",
    "this velocity dispersion would be difficult to interpret as due to a single cluster of galaxies . for a more detailed discussion see schaefer et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .    here",
    "we report polarization spectra obtained with the eso - vlt about 5 days after the @xmath1-ray burst  which sheds new light on the origin and relation between massive stars and @xmath1-ray bursts .",
    "the observations were made on 2002 oct .",
    "5 using the very large telescopes ( ut3 ) of the european southern observatory . four exposures of 30 minutes each with the wollaston prism at position angles at 0 , 45 , 22.5 , and 65.5 were obtained using the eso grism gris@xmath7v at ut oct 5.202 , 5.225 , 5.248 , and 5.269 .",
    "no order sorting filter was applied .",
    "we used melipal (= ut3 ) with fors1 @xcite .",
    "fors1 employs a tk2048eb4 - 1 2048@xmath82048 backside - illuminated thinned ccd .",
    "the cooling of the ccd is performed by a standard eso bath cryostat .",
    "this system uses a fiera controller for ccd readout .",
    "the grism gris-300v ( eso number 10 ) was used for all observations .",
    "the range 360 to 850 nm was covered .",
    "the data reduction package follows the descriptions given in the eso user manual .",
    "the stokes parameters q and u are converted to the degree of polarization using the formula given in wang et al ( 1996 ) which corrects observational biases due to statistical noise .",
    "systematic errors are expected to be small ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the flux spectrum and the stokes @xmath10 and @xmath11 parameters are shown in figure 1 , where the data were binned to 15  to eliminate the effect of correlations of the data values due to finite spectral resolution .",
    "broad band polarization of grb 021004 obtained at the eso vlt - ut3 on october 5.080 to 5.149 was reported by covino et al ( 2002c ) where it was found that the @xmath12 band polarization is @xmath13 with a position angle of @xmath14 .",
    "another set of broad band polarimetry was obtained on oct .",
    "5.175 and the resulting polarization was found to be @xmath15 with position angle @xmath16 ( rol , et al .",
    "about 3 days after these polarization measurement , eso vlt - ut3 obtained yet another measurement and found the @xmath1-ray burst  to be polarized at @xmath17 with position angle @xmath18 ( covino et al .",
    "these observations show marginal evolution of the degree of polarization .",
    "out spectropolarimetry data was obtained on oct 5.202 - 5.269 , soon after the observations of rol et al ( 2002 ) .",
    "the continuum polarization in the @xmath12-band synthesized from these observations is @xmath19 position angle of @xmath20 .",
    "the errors of the position angle of our measurement are obtained directly from the rms scatter of the polarization position angle at different wavelengths . despite the fact that the polarization position angle is consistent with those reported in covino et al ( 2002c , 2002d ) and rol ( 2002 ) , the degree of polarization is considerably higher than the corresponding reported values .",
    "this suggest a rapid evolution of the degree of polarization in the early phases .",
    "it is interesting to note that spectropolarimetry and the broad band polarimetry reported in covino et al ( 2002c ) and rol ( 2002 ) were obtained right at the tail of a big bump in the light curve of the @xmath1-ray burst(e.g .",
    "schaefer et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "the time evolution of the @xmath12-band polarimetry is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the absorption lines are sharp and strong , and the noise at the line dips becomes much larger than neighboring wavelength regions .",
    "the instrumental resolution also makes correlations between neighboring pixels significant in the statistical analysis of the polarization data .",
    "the data are thus re - sampled to bins comparable to the spectral resolution which is 12 .",
    "the re - sampling is done using the weighted integration methods described in wang et al .",
    "( 1996 ) which takes into account the photon statistical errors due to each pixel .",
    "the binned data are shown in figure 3a for the  lines and in figure 3b for the si iv and c iv lines",
    ". an apparent increase of the degree of polarization is observed at the 2@xmath21 level across the narrow  line at 401.1 nm , as shown in figure 3 .",
    "a similar change is also seen across the c iv 515.2 nm line , but with even lower significance .",
    "no such sharp change is observed for the stronger  line at 404.0 nm , or any other strong lines .",
    "we show in figure 4 the polarization blueward of the  absorption line at 404.0 nm .",
    "a gradual increase of the mean degree of polarization toward the blue end of the spectrum is observed . despite the loss of sensitivity of the instrument at the very blue end , polarization as high as 5%",
    "is detected at levels above 2@xmath21 .    in figure 5",
    ", we show the  absorption lines after subtracting a power - law fit to longer wavelengths . with the high signal to noise of these data ,",
    "essentially all the features in the total flux spectrum are real .",
    "if we interpret all these features as , it can be seen that the spectrum consists of many narrow absorption features @xmath3 1 nm wide to a velocity as high as 40,000 km  s@xmath0  from the rest frame defined at z=2.326 .",
    "typical separation of the lines is around 2000 - 3000 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "two especially strong absorptions are seen at 362 and 368 nm that we interpret as  at 27,000 km  s@xmath0  and 31,000 km  s@xmath0 . in principle , these features could be attributed to a large number of intergalacitic clouds forming the  forest , or to high velocity clumps / shells in the direct neighborhood of the @xmath1-ray burst .",
    "the argument in favor of an intimate connection of the multiple l@xmath5 absorption features to the @xmath1-ray burst  comes from the polarization .",
    "since the increase in the polarization shown in figure 4 sets in right at the rest frame , it is reasonable to assume that  is directly responsible for the change in polarization ( see  4.2 ) .",
    "this supposition finds further support in the polarization change over in the three strongest components at @xmath3 3000 , 27,000 and 30,000 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "since intergalactic  absorption systems are incapable of producing polarization , it thus seems likely that the absorptions blueward of  are associated with material of corresponding velocity : material / clumps surrounding the @xmath1-ray burst  with velocity far in excess of that to be expected from stellar winds .",
    "figure 5 also shows portion of the spectrum from about 450 to 520 nm that contains the strong absorption lines of and with the velocity rest frame chosen to be that of the rest frame of 154.9 nm .",
    "note that the two strongest components of nearly line up with those of .",
    "also note that there no strong high velocity ( 20,000  30,000 km  s@xmath0 ) components to the and lines are observed .",
    "this suggests that the broad decrease in flux and rise in polarization blueward of  are due to hydrogen .",
    "the optical emission from a @xmath1-ray burst  is produced by synchrotron emission which is usually highly polarized .",
    "the degree of the polarization depends on the scale of the fluctuations of the magnetic field in the @xmath1-ray burst  source .",
    "when the spatial scales of the fluctuations are about @xmath22 times smaller than the extent of the @xmath1-ray burst  source , the degree of polarization is reduced by @xmath22 times that of the polarization of each single magnetic patch .",
    "gruzinov & waxman ( 1999 ) studied this case , and found that the integrated degree of polarization can be around @xmath23 .",
    "the continuum and the @xmath12-band polarization was observed to be around 1% for grb 021004 .",
    "it thus seems that @xmath24 and the typical scale of the magnetic field is around 1.6% of that of the @xmath1-ray burst   source .",
    "this means there are about 3,600 patches on the surface of the @xmath1-ray burst  optical afterglow .    in the case of the collimated fireballs of ghisellini & lazzati ( 1999 ) and sari ( 1999 ) , the polarization has a more complex behavior related to the break time of the total flux light curve .",
    "the polarization is zero at jet break out .",
    "grb 021004 is obviously associated with very complicated circum - burst matter where several bumps are observed in the broad band light curves .",
    "the polarization measurements reported here were obtained at a time corresponding to the end of a bump of the broad band light curve .",
    "it is not clear if this is merely a coincidence , or of more fundamental significance .",
    "questions then arise as to why the broad absorption feature blueward of  is polarized , and why the polarization varies across any narrow absorption features ?",
    "no such variations are expected within the context of published models for @xmath1-ray burst  polarization .",
    "we propose a very simple model for the observed polarization variation across spectral lines . for illustrative purposes , we start with the patchy models described above and as in ghisellini & lazzati ( 1999 ) .",
    "we assume the surface of the @xmath1-ray burst  optical afterglow consists of @xmath25 patches each polarized at around @xmath26 .",
    "the unabsorbed wavelength regions will then be polarized at around @xmath27 .",
    "the absorbing circum - burst matter may not be uniform , but could be patchy clouds with varying opacity .",
    "the patchy structure of the clouds is expected to absorb different parts of the surface of the optical afterglow differently .",
    "assuming there are @xmath28 absorption patches covering the @xmath1-ray burst and for simplicity that the patches are completely opaque , the degree of polarization from such a configuration would be of the order @xmath29 for @xmath30 . for @xmath31 , the patchiness of the surrounding medium would have little effect on the polarization of the @xmath1-ray burst .",
    "we see from these equations that @xmath32 should be of the same order of @xmath22 for it to have a significant effect and to account for the observed @xmath33 polarization in the  lines .",
    "it is likely that the patchiness of the circum - burst matter is related to the @xmath1-ray burst  event itself .",
    "the intense high energy photons from the @xmath1-ray burstionize the material ahead of the blast wave .",
    "both inhomogeneities of the grb shock and the density fluctuations in the circum - burst matter would affect the opacity patterns .",
    "the patchiness of the emitting surface of the afterglow shock implies that the opacity of the clouds reflects the emission patterns of the @xmath1-ray burst , but from an epoch earlier than when the optical afterglow becomes prominent .",
    "the difference is caused by the fact that the ionization starts immediately after the @xmath1-ray burst  event , which is earlier than the actual epoch when these observations were made , and the absorption is produced after the denser part of the circum - burst material recombines to form neutral hydrogen .",
    "this brings us to the question of the nature of @xmath1-ray bursts . to form blue absorption lines ,",
    "the absorbing clumps must be outside the region that produces the afterglow .",
    "expansion velocities of the order of 30,000 km  s@xmath0   far exceed those expected from winds of massive stars or wr stars .",
    "either the matter is accelerated by the @xmath1-ray burst  or the material was accelerated by a stellar explosion ( there could be some radiative acceleration in the latter case ) . according to schaefer et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , radiative acceleration to such high velocities would require a location of the clouds with the highest velocities at @xmath34 cm .",
    "even if a wind could be radiatively accelerated to a velocity of 30,000 km  s@xmath0 a wolf - rayet star is not a likely candidate .",
    "if our interpretation of the absorption features blueward of the rest frame  as high velocity  is correct , then the high - velocity hydrogen lines are representative of the explosion of a massive star  a type ii supernova , with a hydrogen - rich envelope or wind .",
    "the nature of the high - velocity polarized matter blueward of   can be further constrained by the afterglow light curves .",
    "assuming , as found by schaefer et al .",
    "( 2002 ) that the after glow is produced at distances between @xmath35 to 10@xmath36 cm about 1 day after the burst .",
    "the particle densities of the surrounding medium are of the order of 30 to 100 @xmath37 . for those densities ,",
    "the @xmath1-ray burst  would fully ionize the matter and , using standard recombination theory , hardly any , , or lines would be observable .",
    "note that the standard recombination theory may be not be appropriate in this context because the electron gas is highly non - thermal , thus violating a basic assumption for calculating the recombination cross sections .",
    "these caveats aside , it is thus difficult to see how a circum - burst medium consisting only of a stellar wind could account for both the high - velocity , high - ionization lines and for the even higher velocity hydrogen suggested by the polarization .",
    "rather , it seems that there must be some rather high - density matter in the vicinity of the burst that would allow rapid recombination of some high - velocity hydrogen into the ground state .",
    "the overall smooth variation of the  polarization blueward of the rest frame suggests that the opacity of the absorbing clumps is affected by the @xmath1-ray burst , and that the material responsible for the absorption is at least partially due to matter in the vicinity of the @xmath1-ray burst .",
    "in contrast to the density expected for a stellar wind at distances for which some ions could survive the burst , a supernova envelope could provide both the very high velocities deduced for some of the  and sufficiently high densities that recombination could be rapid . for supernova envelopes",
    ", we expect densities of about @xmath38 to 10@xmath39 particles @xmath37 at a distance of @xmath35 cm resulting in very small recombination times .",
    "the scenario that emerges to account for the polarization is the presence of the ejecta of a type ii supernova with a thin layer of hydrogen ejected to velocities as high as 40,000 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "such high velocity material is not unprecedented , but is indeed observed in some type ii supernovae . in order for the supernova material that causes the high - velocity  absorption and the polarization blueward of the rest frame , the supernova material must lie outside the afterglow shock when the observations were made about 1 day after the @xmath1-ray burst . to reach a distance in excess of @xmath35 cm",
    ", the supernova explosion must have preceded the @xmath1-ray burst  by several weeks . but note again that this conclusion is based on the assumption that the after glow was produced at a distance about @xmath35 cm from the the center of the grb .",
    "if this picture is correct , the resulting densities at @xmath40 cm are of order @xmath38 @xmath37 , i.e. in contradiction to the densities derived from the light curve .",
    "this may suggest a medium that has both low and high densities at about the same distance .",
    "this and the intrinsic line widths of the high - velocity  components ( 1000 km  s@xmath0 ) that are small compared to the overall velocity ( 30,000 km  s@xmath0 ) indicate a very clumpy medium . alternatively , high velocity bullets penetrating the ism prior to the classical supernova shell may also be possible .",
    "our polarization observations have thus led to the suggestion that a supernova preceded grb 021004 by weeks to months .",
    "this is very reminiscent of the  supernova \" hypothesis of vietri & stella ( 1998 , 1999 ) in which a neutron star with mass above the non - rotating limit eventually loses its rotational support and collapses to make a black hole .",
    "this model has been invoked to account for transient x - ray fe lines in grb  991216 by vietri et al .",
    "( 2001 ; see also lazzati , campana & ghisellini 1999 ) , bttcher & fryer(2001 ) , and bttcher , fryer , & dermer(2002 ) , and in the context of pulsar wind models for @xmath1-ray bursts  by k \" onigl & granot(2002 ) and wang , dai & lu ( 2002 ) .",
    "one drawback of this model is the uncertainty in the initial rotation state and hence the plausibility of the initial  supermassive \" neutron star rotation state and the uncertainty of the resulting time to collapse .",
    "nevertheless , our interpretation of the behavior of the flux blueward of the rest frame  and its polarization in grb  021004 has led us to a similar conclusion , that a hydrogen - rich supernova exploded several weeks to months prior to the @xmath1-ray burst ..    our spectropolarimetry has raised the intriguing possibility that grb 021004 is associated with a supernova . whether or not this picture ultimately prevails",
    ", these observations clearly show that prompt spectropolarimetry is a powerful tool in the quest to resolve the mystery of the origin of @xmath1-ray bursts .",
