    "one of the major achievements of the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( _ iras _ ) is the discovery of a significant number of galaxies emitting the bulk of their radiation at far - infrared ( ir ) wavelengths .",
    "luminous ir galaxies ( lirgs , with ir luminosity @xmath4 ) are as numerous as optical starburst and seyfert galaxies with similar bolometric luminosity in the local universe , while the more extreme class of ultra - luminous ir galaxies ( ulirgs ; @xmath5 ) has similar space density and bolometric luminosity to optically - selected quasars @xcite .",
    "many studies have been devoted to the exploration of the origin of these ir galaxies , and it is now becoming the general agreement that strong interactions and mergers of gas - rich galaxies are the trigger for the majority of them . in the complete sample of _ iras _ 1 jy ulirgs , @xcite find that nearly 100 % of ir galaxies show strong signs of tidal interaction .    on the other hand ,",
    "there is still much debate about energy sources of ir galaxies .",
    "their ir luminosity can certainly come from dust reprocessing of radiations from starburst and/or active galactic nuclei ( agns ) activity . in this context , it is worth noting that ulirgs and agns most probably have evolutionary connection .",
    "it is suggested that major mergers of gas - rich galaxies first form a `` cool '' ulirg dominated by dusty starburst , which is followed by a `` warm '' ulirg phase when an agn turns on and starts to heat surrounding dust .",
    "then the agn evolves into the dominant energy source and blows away the surrounding dust cocoon , leading to an optically - bright quasar ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , observational investigation of energy sources in ir galaxies at various evolutionary stages is a key for understanding the whole picture of galaxy evolution including agn phase .",
    "however , such investigation has been hampered by heavy dust obscuration inside ir galaxies .",
    "although numerous efforts have been devoted to the subject at various wavelengths ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the results are still largely controversial : different studies give the inconsistent estimates of relative contributions from starburst and agns for the same population .    in order to address the issue of energy sources in ir galaxies , we aim to investigate the presence of agns independently from the previous studies , in a large number of ir galaxies including ulirgs , lirgs , and less luminous populations . in this paper , we present the near - ir spectra of nine _ iras _ galaxies with relatively low ir luminosity , obtained by the isle imager and spectrograph mounted on the okayama astrophysical observatory ( oao ) 1.88 m telescope .",
    "near - ir light has a few advantages over those at other wavelengths in probing ir galaxies .",
    "first , it suffers much less from dust obscuration than optical light , since the extinction at the former wavelengths are only about a tenth of that at the latter wavelengths ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "second , near - ir observations cost much less than x - ray , mid- or far - ir observations , hence a statistical number of objects can easily be investigated .",
    "third , there are many emission lines suitable for probing their radiation sources in near - ir spectral region ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite demonstrate the power of near - ir spectroscopy by observing 39 ulirgs and finding that at least 50 % of optically - classified seyfert 2 galaxies present hidden broad - line - region ( blr ) emissions in near - ir lines .",
    "it means that nuclear regions of many optical seyfert 2 galaxies , obscured completely in optical wave bands , are actually optically thin at near - ir wave bands .",
    "we observed the four near - ir emission lines , [ fe ii ] 1.257 @xmath0 m and pa@xmath1 for the whole sample of nine galaxies and h@xmath2 2.121 @xmath0 m and br@xmath3 for two of them , whose flux ratios have been proposed as a diagnostic tool of dominant energy sources of emission - line galaxies @xcite .",
    "note that this kind of diagnostic diagrams works only with a statistical number of sample , since there are always outlying objects . in this sense",
    ", we do not intend to present conclusive arguments with the small number of objects observed in this work , but rather aim to demonstrate the capability of the isle to investigate near - ir emission lines of ir galaxies for future projects .",
    "hereafter , [ fe ii ] 1.257 @xmath0 m and h@xmath2 2.121 @xmath0 m lines are abbreviated to [ fe ii ] and h@xmath2 for simplicity .",
    "the target objects were selected from the imperial _ iras_-fsc redshift catalog ( iifscz ; @xcite ) based on the _ iras _ faint source catalog ( fsc ) .",
    "the observability of the four emission lines , [ fe ii ] , pa @xmath1 , h@xmath2 , and br @xmath3 , in the near - ir atmospheric window gives a severe restriction on redshifts , while the additional constraints come from positions and near - ir brightness ( @xmath7 mag ) .",
    "we summarize the redshifts , the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; @xcite ) @xmath8-band magnitudes , the 60-@xmath0 m fluxes ( @xmath9 ) and the ir luminosity ( @xmath10 ) based on the _ iras _ measurements , and the corresponding _ iras _ names of the targets in table [ tab : targets ] .",
    "they are not extremely luminous at ir wavelengths compared to lirgs or ulirgs .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , < \" , ]     note  2-@xmath11 upper limits are given for the fluxes of undetected emission lines .",
    "the measured line flux ratios of [ fe ii]/pa @xmath1 and h@xmath2/br @xmath3 are plotted in figure [ lineratios ] . @xcite",
    "suggest this diagram as a diagnostic tool for energy sources of the line emissions .",
    "later the classification scheme is updated by @xcite and @xcite , who find that agns are characterized by the two ratios between 0.6 and 2 , while the smaller or larger values indicate starburst / h ii galaxies or low ionization nuclear emission - line regions ( liners ) , respectively ( dotted lines of figure [ lineratios ] ) .",
    "however , note that this diagnostic diagram works only with a statistical number of sample , since there are the objects that do not meet the above criteria in the compilation of @xcite .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)f2.eps    the most noticeable object in figure [ lineratios ] is ngc 1266 .",
    "its [ fe ii ] line flux is at least 10 times larger than pa @xmath1 , clearly indicating it is a liner .",
    "therefore we obtained the additional @xmath12-band spectrum and found that another [ fe ii ] line , [ fe ii ] 1.644 @xmath0 m , is also strong in this object .",
    "the fwhms of the two [ fe ii ] lines , @xmath13500 km s@xmath14 , are significantly larger than the local escape velocity ( @xmath15 340 km s@xmath14 ; @xcite ) , which is indicative of an energetic phenomenon occurring in the galaxy .",
    "actually , the presence of an agn or liner in the galaxy is implied by the radio , optical , and x - ray observations ( @xcite and references therein ) . a powerful molecular wind from the nucleus of ngc 1266",
    "is found , which is suggested to be driven by an agn since the estimated star - formation rate is insufficient for the drive .",
    "our near - ir exploration present a new evidence for the liner nature of this galaxy .",
    "ngc 2633 and ngc 2903 have the consistent [ fe ii]/pa @xmath1 and h@xmath2/br @xmath3 ratios with agns . @xmath12- and",
    "@xmath16-band spectra of ngc 2633 were obtained by @xcite , who find that h@xmath2 and br @xmath3 are clearly detected while [ fe ii ] 1.644 @xmath0 m is not .",
    "the ews of h@xmath2 and br @xmath3 measured by them , 3.0 @xmath17 0.5   and 5.0 @xmath17 0.5  , are in excellent agreement with our results .",
    "while @xcite classify this galaxy as a starburst based on the optical [ o i ] 0.63 @xmath0m / h @xmath18 and near - ir [ fe ii ] 1.644 @xmath0m / br @xmath3 line ratios , our new data indicate that ngc 2633 may be more like an agn . in reality",
    "ngc 2633 sits on the borderline of starbursts and agns in our diagram and of starbursts and `` composite '' objects in the vanzi et al .",
    "classification diagram , suggesting the contributions from both starburst and agn activity .",
    "ngc 2903 is a well - known starburst galaxy and has been studied at various wavelengths from radio to x - ray ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while the majority of the radiation is thought to come from star - formation activity , @xcite raise the possibility of a low - luminosity agn present in this galaxy based on its x - ray property .",
    "the near - ir line flux ratios presented here support this possibility .",
    "the [ fe ii]/pa @xmath1 ratios of ngc 3034 , mrk 33 , ngc 7625 , and ngc 7714 are found to be at most 0.3 , while no observation is available for the measurement of h@xmath2 and br @xmath3 . in the sample compiled by @xcite ,",
    "all the sources with [ fe ii]/pa @xmath1 @xmath19 have h@xmath2/br @xmath3 @xmath19 .",
    "it may imply that the above four objects are most likely categorized into starburst galaxies in figure [ lineratios ] , while the additional observations of h@xmath2 and br @xmath3 lines in these objects are needed for further discussion on this point .",
    "no clear evidence for the presence of agns has been obtained at other wavelengths , despite numerous observations dedicated to these well - known starburst galaxies .",
    "another worth - noting point is the p cygni profile observed in [ fe ii ] and pa @xmath1 lines of ngc 3034 ( see figure [ spec ] ) .",
    "the absorption features are detected at @xmath13250 km s@xmath14 blueshift relative to the line centers , pointing to the presence of outflowing material in front of the line emission region .",
    "these features are not found in the optical spectra of nuclear star clusters of this galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which may be due to the heavy dust obscuration .",
    "observations with higher spatial resolution than the present one are required for locating this velocity component in the nuclear region of the galaxy .",
    "in this paper we demonstrate the capability of the isle imager and spectrograph mounted on the oao 1.88 m telescope to investigate near - ir line emissions of _ iras _ galaxies .",
    "the observation targets were selected from the iifscz based on the _ iras _ fsc .",
    "all of them are the nearby galaxies at the redshifts @xmath20 . [ fe ii ]",
    "1.257 @xmath0 m and pa @xmath1 emission lines were observed in a sample of nine galaxies , while h@xmath2 2.121 @xmath0 m and br @xmath3 lines were additionally observed for two of them .",
    "based on the measured line flux ratios , ngc 1266 is found to have a liner , while ngc 2633 and ngc 2903 possibly harbor agns . on the other hand , no agn signal is found for ngc 3034 , mrk 33 , ngc 7625 , and ngc 7714 . in addition , we find the relatively large [ fe ii ] line widths of @xmath13500 km s@xmath14 in ngc 1266 and the p cygni profile of [ fe ii ] and pa @xmath1 lines in ngc 3034 .",
    "the present work shows the potential ability of the isle near - ir spectroscopy to shed new light on the nature of ir galaxies , either through a statistical survey of galaxies on diagnostic diagrams such as figure [ lineratios ] , or an exploration of spectral features found in individual galaxies .",
