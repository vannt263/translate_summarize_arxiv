    "massive stars impact many areas of astrophysics . in most galactic environments",
    "they dominate the radiative , mechanical and chemical feedback on the interstellar medium , thus regulating the evolution of galaxies .",
    "many low - mass stars form in clusters near massive stars , and their protoplanetary disks can be affected by this feedback also .",
    "there is some evidence that our own solar system was influenced in this way . despite this importance",
    ", there is no consensus on the basic formation mechanism of massive stars .",
    "theories range from scaled - up versions of low - mass star formation @xcite , to competitive bondi - hoyle accretion at the center of forming star clusters @xcite , to stellar collisions @xcite .",
    "the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) is the nearest region of massive star formation and thus a crucial testing ground for theoretical models .    of particular interest",
    "amongst the onc s @xmath0 members in this regard are : @xmath1  ori  c , the most massive binary in the cluster with stars of masses @xmath10 and",
    "@xmath3 ; the becklin - neugebauer ( bn ) object , a @xmath4 runaway star of @xmath11 @xcite ; and the kleinmann - low ( kl ) nebula protostar , a highly - obscured , about @xmath12 object still accreting gas while also driving a powerful , apparently `` explosive '' outflow @xcite .",
    "the unusual behavior of bn and kl is much debated bearing implications towards massive - star formation theories : how did bn acquire its high velocity ? how is this related to massive star formation in the kl nebula ?",
    "bn , like kl , is heavily obscured by dust so its luminosity of @xmath13 mostly emerges in the infrared @xcite .",
    "the above luminosity constrains bn s mass to be @xmath14 , assuming it is on the zero age main sequence @xcite . for this estimate and throughout the paper we have adopted @xmath15  pc for the distance to the cluster .",
    "astrometry based on mm and radio observations indicate that bn is a runaway star @xcite , with some recent measurements of its motion in the onc frame of @xmath16 towards p.a.@xmath17@xcite and @xmath18 towards p.a.@xmath19 @xcite ( figure  1 ) .",
    "this corresponds to a velocity @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "bn has an observed radial ( lsr ) velocity of @xmath21 @xcite , while the onc mean is @xmath22 ( based on a mean heliocentric velocity of about 1000 onc stars of @xmath23 ; * ? ? ?",
    "including this @xmath24 radial velocity with respect to the onc mean , the 3d onc - frame velocity of bn is @xmath25 .",
    "this is much greater than the velocity dispersion of onc stars , variously inferred to be @xmath26 based on the proper motions of @xmath27 bright ( @xmath28 ) stars within 30@xmath29 of the onc center @xcite , @xmath30 based on proper motions of @xmath31 fainter stars within 15@xmath29 of the onc center @xcite , and @xmath32 based on radial velocity measurements ( potentially affected by motion induced by binarity ) of @xmath33 stars within @xmath3460@xmath29 of the onc center @xcite .",
    "thus there is little doubt that bn is a runaway star , which formed and was then accelerated in the onc .    supernova explosion of one member of a binary can lead to the other being ejected at high speeds @xcite .",
    "the onc is too young ( most stars are @xmath35  myr old ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for a supernova to have occurred . nor is there any evidence for a recent supernova . alternatively , runaway stars can be produced via dynamical ejection  a gravitational slingshot  from a triple or higher multiple system @xcite , in which the lowest mass member tends to be ejected .",
    "indeed , such dynamical ejection of stars naturally happen in dense and young clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "similar ejections have also been discussed in the context of some other onc stars @xcite .",
    "thus bn , having formed in the onc , should have been accelerated via dynamical ejection .",
    "the predictions of this scenario are very specific : somewhere along bn s past trajectory should be a massive binary ( or higher order multiple ) , with two components likely more massive than bn , recoiling in the opposite direction , and , as we shall see , with specific orbital properties .",
    "two scenarios for the dynamical ejection of bn have been proposed .",
    "( 1 ) ejection from the @xmath8  binary @xcite : in this scenario the bn star is ejected via a strong gravitational scattering interaction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and later plows , _ by chance _ , through the kl star - forming core to drive tidally - enhanced accretion and thus outflow activity .",
    "if so , a model of formation of the kl massive protostar via an ordered collapse of a gas core to a central disk@xcite , similar to how low - mass stars are thought to form , is still broadly applicable , though subject to the tidal perturbation from bn s fly - by .",
    "( 2 ) ejection from the kl ( source _ i _ ) protostar @xcite : here it is proposed that the kl outflow is related to the disintegration of a _ forming _ triple system , which ejected bn and produced a binary suggested to be the radio source i @xcite . this binary has recoiled southwards from the original formation site and is now hidden , _ by chance _ , behind or in the dense gas core near the center of the kl nebula . in this scenario the gas from the original formation site , like the stars , has also been expelled in this event to form the outflow , and the core that formed these massive stars has been destroyed . if true , this is a very different formation process , and would indicate that chaotic gravitational interactions between multiple protostars followed by complete ejection of both stars and gas are intrinsic features of massive star formation @xcite , at least in this case in orion .",
    "figure  1 shows a near - ir image of the central region of the onc , including bn , the kl protostar ( marked by radio source _ i _ ) and the famous trapezium stars , of which @xmath8  is the brightest . the past trajectory of bn is indicated based on its present motion and assuming no acceleration .",
    "it goes near kl _ and _ the trapezium stars .",
    "the high obscuration to kl means that there is little direct constraint on the properties of the star(s ) : for example there is no evidence that it is even a binary .",
    "in contrast , the properties of @xmath8  have been measured much more precisely and so the scenario of ejection of bn via a binary - single strong scattering can be tested much more rigorously and is the goal of this study .    in  [ sec :",
    "method ] we summarize our methods and numerical calculations . in ",
    "[ sec : results ] we present our key results , which show that @xmath8  has orbital properties expected if it ejected bn . in ",
    "[ sec : probability ] we estimate the probability that @xmath8  has not been responsible for bn s ejection and has these and other observed properties simply by chance .",
    "we summarize and conclude in  [ sec : conclude ] .",
    "we investigate the scenario of ejection of bn from the @xmath8  binary by carrying out calculations of gravitational scattering between the three stars . we adopt the central values of the observed masses of the @xmath8  binary members , @xmath36 and @xmath37 . for bn",
    "we adopt the central value of the mass estimate @xmath38 , which is based on the observed cluster - frame proper motion of @xmath8  of @xmath39 @xcite , i.e. , @xmath40 , and assuming it is due to recoil from ejecting bn . note that this mass is consistent with that inferred from the luminosity of bn , discussed above .",
    "the error range includes an assumed pre - ejection motion of the center of mass of the 3 stars along the ejection axis of 0.7  @xmath41 , i.e. , similar to that observed for other bright onc stars @xcite .",
    "we carry out a systematic investigation of the three possible strong scattering interactions between a binary and a single star . depending on the initial perturber and the binary members",
    "these interactions can be divided into three types . *",
    "type 1 - bn star is the perturber : * here bn is initially a single star that interacts with @xmath8  members @xmath42  and @xmath43 .",
    "we denote this initial configuration as [ @xmath42 , @xmath43 ]  bn .",
    "the square brackets denote a bound binary and the star outside the brackets is a single stellar perturber . *",
    "type 2 - @xmath43  is the perturber : * this can be denoted as [ @xmath42 , bn ] @xmath43 . *",
    "type 3 - @xmath42  is the perturber : * this can be denoted as [ @xmath43 , bn ] @xmath42 .    out of all outcomes of our numerical experiments we focus on the ones that could lead to ejection of bn .",
    "* case 1 - bn fly - by : * this is a type 1 interaction and the outcome of interest is  preservation \" where the initial binary members remain unchanged and bn flies by after interaction with the initial binary .",
    "we write this interaction as @xmath45\\:bn \\longrightarrow [ \\theta^1c_1,\\theta^1c_2]\\ : bn$ ] .",
    "the arrow points from the initial to the final configuration .",
    "* case 2 - ejection of bn from a binary via exchange with @xmath46 : * @xmath47\\:\\theta^1c_2 \\longrightarrow [ \\theta^1c_1,\\theta^1c_2]\\ : bn$ ] .",
    "* case 3 - ejection of bn from a binary via exchange with @xmath48 : * @xmath49\\:\\theta^1c_1 \\longrightarrow [ \\theta^1c_1,\\theta^1c_2]\\ : bn$ ] .",
    "the  types \" and  cases \" are different in the fact that for the types we only take into account the initial conditions and allow all outcomes , whereas , the cases are more restrictive and only considers the outcomes where bn is ejected leaving behind a bound binary .",
    "there are 7 parameters that describe the initial conditions of each binary - single star interaction and since the 3-body problem is chaotic we must sample over the expected distributions of these parameters : ( 1 ) eccentricity of the initial binary , @xmath50 . for each case",
    "we investigate two extreme distributions : ( a ) circular , @xmath51 , for all systems , which may be expected if the binaries have recently formed from a gas disk that has damped out noncircular motions ; ( b ) thermal @xcite , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the fraction of the binary population .",
    "this is an extreme scenario that would result if binaries have had time to thermalize via stellar interactions with other cluster stars .",
    "the actual situation for onc binaries should be between these limits .",
    "( 2 ) semi - major axis of the initial binary , @xmath54 .",
    "we assume a flat distribution @xcite @xmath55 from @xmath56 ( approximately the limit resulting from physical contact ) to @xmath57 ( the hard - soft boundary beyond which binaries are expected to be disrupted by interactions with other cluster stars ; * ? ? ?",
    "( 3 ) initial impact parameter , @xmath58 . for each case and each sampling of @xmath54",
    "we investigate the full range of impact parameters that can lead to scattering events strong enough to eject bn with its observed high velocity .",
    "this is achieved by increasing @xmath58 from small values until the regime where all interactions are weak fly - bys incapable of increasing bn s velocity to the observed large value .",
    "( 4 ) initial relative velocity at infinity , @xmath59 , in the frame of the center of mass of the binary .",
    "we assume that the stars have velocities following a maxwellian distribution with a dispersion of @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "we have repeated the numerical experiments with @xmath61 , finding qualitatively similar results .",
    "( 5 ) the initial angle of the orbital angular momentum vector ( @xmath62 ) of the binary with respect to the velocity vector ( @xmath63 ) of the approaching single star , which is assumed to be randomly oriented . ( 6 ) the initial angle between the major axis of the binary orbit and the velocity vector of the approaching single star , which is assumed to be randomly oriented . ( 7 ) the initial orbital phase of the binary , which is assumed to be random .",
    "we find cross - sections ( @xmath64 ) of the various outcomes of the cases 1 , 2 , & 3 binary - single interactions numerically using the fewbody software @xcite , which uses an order @xmath65 runge - kutta integrator , by performing @xmath7 numerical scattering experiments to sample the @xmath66 dimensional parameter space that is needed to describe the possible interactions .",
    "this large number of numerical scattering experiments gives us rigorous sampling of all properties in the dynamical scattering problem , including the initial semimajor axis of the binary ( @xmath54 ) , initial eccentricity ( @xmath50 ) , binary orbital phases , initial velocity at infinity ( @xmath59 ) of the single star , the initial impact parameter of the encounter ( @xmath58 ) , the angle between the initial major axis relative to @xmath63 and the initial orientation of the binary ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "for example , we sample @xmath58 as fine as @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the impact parameter at infinity that results in a closest approach within @xmath70 . starting from a small value , @xmath58 is sampled with the above - mentioned resolution up to at least @xmath71 . within this interval",
    "smaller intervals of @xmath58 , @xmath72 are chosen .",
    "the impact parameter is chosen from each of these intervals uniform in the area of the annulus between @xmath73 and @xmath74 . if a particular final outcome of interest or `` event '' is achieved ( in particular bn - velocity  or bn - true  events , defined below ) ,",
    "then contribution of that event to the total @xmath64 is simply @xmath75 ( @xcite ; but see more recently @xcite ) .",
    "afterwards , to ascertain that all energetic encounters are sampled , we increase the maximum @xmath58 geometrically until @xmath76 . for our case",
    ", this large value of @xmath77 corresponds to as large a physical distance as the cluster size making sure that all possible energetic encounters are captured in the determination of the cross - sections @xmath64 .    using the large ensemble of numerical gravitational scattering experiments",
    "we evaluate the @xmath64s for outcomes where bn is ejected leaving behind @xmath42  and @xmath43   in a bound binary ( henceforth , ",
    "bn - ejection \" events ) . a subset of the bn - ejection  events where bn is ejected with the observed velocity of @xmath78 are called `` bn - velocity '' events .",
    "we do not put any constraints on the binary properties that is left behind for the bn - velocity  events .",
    "we further calculate the @xmath64s of a subset of bn - velocity  events where the final binary is left with orbital properties similar to those observed of @xmath8 , namely , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 .",
    "the bn - ejection  events are used to explore the velocity distribution of bn if it is ejected via a strong binary - single interaction .",
    "bn - velocity  events , a subset of the bn - ejection  events , show us all possible interactions over a range of @xmath54 where bn could have an energy compatible with the observed energy .",
    "a further subset , the bn - true  events , give us stronger constraints and indicates the range of initial binary properties most likely to create the observed @xmath8  binary as well as the runaway bn star .",
    "in this section we present the key results of our numerical experiments .",
    "we start with overall outcomes of all our numerical experiments for all cases and @xmath50 distributions and then increasingly focus our attention towards the observed bn-@xmath8  system and compare its various properties with those predicted from our simulations .",
    "figure  [ fig : branching ] shows the branching ratios of all outcomes in general from our numerical experiments .",
    "a handful of interesting aspects are evident in the branching ratios for the given masses of the 3 stars involved in these interactions .",
    "disruption ( or ionization ) of the initial binary happens only when the binary is dynamically soft @xcite , i.e. , the value of the binary binding energy is @xmath81 the kinetic energy of the perturber .",
    "this is achieved at large @xmath82 , for types 1 and 2 . for",
    "type 3 ionization can happen at relatively smaller @xmath83 due to the higher mass of the perturber and relatively lower binding energy of the initial binary .",
    "nevertheless , even for type 3 , branching ratio for ionization becomes comparable or greater than exchange outcomes only at @xmath84 .    for types 1 and 2 ,",
    "exchange with the primary is very unlikely , since here the primary is significantly more massive ( @xmath85 ) than the secondary ( @xmath86 and @xmath87 for interactions of types 1 and 2 , respectively ) . in interaction of type 3 , since the initial binary consists of two stars with comparable masses , both exchanges are almost equally likely . for type 3",
    "the fraction of exchange outcomes is comparable to the fraction of fly - by events for a large range of @xmath54 taking into account sufficiently strong encounters ( see  [ sec : method ] for the value of the maximum impact parameter ) .",
    "the fraction of fly - by outcomes is of course formally infinite since one can always use a sufficiently large impact parameter where nothing but a weak fly - by is the outcome .",
    "collisional outcomes are comparable with exchanges only for sufficiently small @xmath54 values . in interactions of type 1 , preservation is the channel that can produce the observed bn-@xmath8  system . for type 1 for both @xmath50 distributions collisions become important for @xmath88 . for interactions of types 2 and 3 , exchange of the perturber with the primary",
    "is the channel that can produce the observed bn-@xmath8  system . for type 2 ,",
    "collisions become comparable with the bn-@xmath8  producing channel for @xmath89 a few au . whereas , for interactions of type 3 , collisions remain comparable to the bn-@xmath8  producing channel for @xmath88 . in interactions of all types collisions",
    "happen more often for the thermal @xmath50 distribution since for the thermal @xmath50 distribution the pericenter distances for the stars in binary can be much smaller than that for the circular @xmath50 distribution for any given @xmath54 .",
    "we later show (  [ sec : cross - sections ] ) that bn - true  events happen in a given range of @xmath54 for a given interaction type . for all interaction types and @xmath50 distributions collisions have much lower branching ratios compared to the branching ratios for the bn-@xmath8   production channels for the ranges of @xmath54 where bn - true  events can occur .    in the following sections we increasingly focus on outcomes that are similar to the observed bn-@xmath8  system .",
    "we first present results for all events where the bn star is ejected ( bn - ejection ,  [ sec : vdist ] ) .",
    "then we present results for all outcomes where the bn star is ejected with a velocity within the observed range of @xmath90 ( bn - velocity ,  [ sec : eratio ] ) .",
    "we then restrict our attention to only a subset of the bn - velocity  events where the final binary has properties similar to the observed @xmath8  binary ( bn - true ,  [ sec : cross - sections ] and  [ sec : angle ] ) .      increasing the kinetic energy of bn by about two orders of magnitude compared to the value",
    "expected given the onc s velocity dispersion is at the heart of the problem .",
    "hence , we focus on the velocity distribution of bn following ejection . in addition , we focus on energy considerations for the scattering problem , especially the ratio of the kinetic energy of bn s ejection to the total energy of the binary left behind .",
    "first we explore given the masses of the three stars in the interaction , and given that bn is ejected leaving the other stars in a binary , how likely it is for bn to acquire a velocity significantly higher than the velocity dispersion ( @xmath91 ) in the onc .",
    "we calculate the cross - section @xmath92 for bn - ejection  events for a given @xmath54 , for each cases 13 , and each @xmath50 distribution .",
    "the overall cross - section for bn - ejection   events for _ any _ @xmath54 is calculated by multiplying @xmath92 with the probability of finding an initial binary with that @xmath54 assuming the semimajor axis distribution for binaries is flat in logarithmic intervals within the physical limits discussed in ",
    "[ sec : method ] .",
    "thus , the normalized @xmath92 is @xmath93 , where , @xmath94 .    figure  [ fig : vdist ] shows the cumulative distribution of @xmath95 as a function of bn s velocity ( @xmath96 ) calculated using @xmath97 .",
    "we find that binary - single interactions involving the three stars in question can eject the bn star with velocities that can exceed @xmath98 by more than two orders of magnitude .",
    "however , the cross - sections for such events reduce as @xmath96 increases",
    ". for both @xmath50 distributions case 3 shows a higher fraction of high - velocity ejection events .",
    "this is because in case 3 the perturber is the most massive star in the triplet , the one that finally becomes the @xmath42  star .",
    "hence , the total available energy is higher in case 3 events .",
    "the problem of binary - single scattering can be understood by comparing the kinetic energy and the potential energy of the systems since the outcomes differ qualitatively depending on the relative values of these quantities ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we explore if bn is ejected with @xmath99 , then what is the distribution of cross - section for the various cases and @xmath50-distributions as a function of the @xmath100 and the velocity of ejection , @xmath96 . here , @xmath101 is the ratio of the final kinetic energy ( @xmath102 ) of _ both _ the single star and the binary star system ( based on the motion of its center of mass ) to the total energy ( gravitational energy plus kinetic energy of orbital motion ) of the binary ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : eratio_v ] shows a @xmath104 distribution of the overall @xmath92 for any @xmath54 as a function of @xmath96 and @xmath100 for all cases 13 , and all @xmath50 distributions .",
    "the highest ejection velocities for the bn star happens for @xmath100 between 0.1 and 1 for all cases .",
    "note that the distributions for cases 1 and 2 are very similar .",
    "this is due to the similarity in masses of bn and @xmath43 .",
    "however , in case 3 the most massive star is the perturber .",
    "in addition , the most massive star exchanges into the final binary increasing the binding energy of the final binary star system . hence , there is a tail for high @xmath100 values where bn can still be ejected with a high velocity . even for the more energetic case 3",
    "events , the maximum velocity for ejections are achieved within a narrow range of @xmath105 .    a high value ( @xmath106 ) of the ratio between the velocities of the incoming single star ( expected to be near @xmath98 ) and the ejected single star is needed to create runaway stars by definition .",
    "this is possible for strong encounters involving a binary and a single star where a fraction of binding energy of the binary is converted into the kinetic energy ( @xmath107 ) of the ejected star .",
    "if the final outcome is again a binary and the runaway ejected star ( the binary members are not required to remain the initial ones , e.g. , for cases 2 and 3 ) then the kinetic energy of the stars undergoing dynamical ejection , @xmath108 ( here @xmath109 indicates the observed values ) is expected to be less than the magnitude of the total energy of the resulting binary , @xmath110 .",
    "in addition to requiring @xmath111 , one also expects it to achieve a value of order unity , i.e. not too much less than one . for @xmath112 ,",
    "collisional outcomes dominate ( figure  [ fig : branching ] ; also see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath113 outcomes with a disruption of the binary dominates creating 3 single stars ( figure  [ fig : branching ] ) .",
    "the observed value for the bn-@xmath8  system is @xmath114 , consistent with it being a result of a binary - single interaction .",
    "we now focus on the subset of bn - ejection  events ( bn - velocity ) where bn is ejected with the observed velocity of @xmath115 (  [ sec : method ] ) via any one of the cases 13 ( a small strip in the vertical axis in figure  [ fig : eratio_v ] ) .",
    "the @xmath8  orbit is eccentric ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "indeed , strong encounters are expected to leave behind binaries with generally high eccentricities .",
    "we now want to see the @xmath104 distribution of overall cross - section for all bn - velocity  events for any @xmath54 as a function of @xmath100 and the final eccentricity .    in figure [",
    "fig : eratio_e ] we plot the 2d distributions of @xmath64 for the bn - velocity  events in the @xmath117 versus final @xmath118 plane for cases 1 , 2 , & 3 for both the circular and thermal @xmath50 distributions .",
    "the observed values of the bn-@xmath8  system are also shown .",
    "these overlap within the @xmath119 contours for all cases .",
    "the energy of the @xmath8  binary is just what we would expect if it had ejected bn at the observed velocity .",
    "its high eccentricity , @xmath120 , is also naturally explained by the recent ejection of bn since during ejection the potential of the system is changing rapidly .    note",
    "that if the @xmath8  binary was unrelated to bn , then @xmath100 could have values in a large range spanning many orders of magnitude .",
    "for example , the range in @xmath121 for the binary is determined by contact ( @xmath34 a few stellar radii ) to the hard - soft boundary in onc ( @xmath122 for the velocity dispersion in onc ) . thus @xmath103 for @xmath8 if unrelated to bn s ejection , could be expected to have values anywhere between @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "it is thus very interesting to find the observed bn-@xmath8  system with energies so close to the expected energies if they have had a binary - single scattering encounter in the past .",
    "the likelihood of this occuring simply by chance rather than by being caused by interaction with bn is explored in  [ sec : probability ] .",
    "we evaluate the cross - sections for outcomes where bn is ejected with the observed velocity of @xmath78 ( `` bn - velocity '' events ) .",
    "we further calculate the cross - section of a subset of bn - velocity  events where the final binary is left with orbital properties similar to those observed of @xmath8 , namely , @xmath125 , and @xmath126 (; `` bn - true '' events ) .    for cases 1 , 2 , 3 with circular initial @xmath50 distribution , @xmath127 , while for thermal initial @xmath50 distribution , @xmath128 . for cases 1 , 2 , 3 with circular @xmath50-distribution , @xmath129 , while for thermal @xmath50 distribution , @xmath130 .",
    "the three cases have similar cross - sections , with case 3 , i.e. @xmath49\\:\\theta^1c_1 \\longrightarrow [ \\theta^1c_1,\\theta^1c_2]\\ : bn$ ] , somewhat more preferred .",
    "the cross - sections for bn - velocity  and bn - true  events as a function of @xmath58 , are shown in figure  [ fig : b_sigma ] .",
    "the cross - sections for a given @xmath58 and for all explored @xmath54 are normalized using the probability , @xmath131 , of finding a binary with semimajor axis @xmath54 , assuming a semimajor axis distribution flat in log intervals . for small values of @xmath132 ,",
    "the cross - sections grow geometrically as @xmath133 and then decline .",
    "this decline , seen in all cases , is simply due to the fact that the interactions are happening at larger and larger impact parameters and at some point no interactions are expected to be strong enough to increase the energy of the ejected star to the observed value of bn .",

    "the cross - sections for bn - velocity  and bn - true  events as a function of @xmath54 are shown in figure  [ fig : a_sigma ] .",
    "we find that bn - velocity  events happen via binary - single scattering encounters for a large range of @xmath54 , but bn - true  events place much tighter constraints on @xmath54 .",
    "for example , case 3 , which is the most favored , requires the initial binary [ @xmath134 , bn ] , i.e. two approximately equal - mass stars of @xmath135 , to have originally had @xmath136  au .",
    "note that depending on the case , different ranges of @xmath54 contribute towards creating systems similar to the observed bn-@xmath8  system .",
    "moreover , note that the @xmath54 ranges where the bn - true  events occur via the three cases 1  3 , ejection of bn is the most likely outcome among all other possible outcomes ( except of course weak fly - bys ; figure  [ fig : branching ] ) .",
    "this gives us further confidence in the scenario that the bn-@xmath8  system has been created via a strong binary - single interaction involving these three stars .    throughout this study",
    "we have used the central values of the estimated masses for the three stars .",
    "dynamically there should be no qualitative difference in the outcomes if the masses are changed within the mass errors .",
    "however , note that the masses of @xmath134 and bn are comparable .",
    "in fact the error ranges actually overlap .",
    "due to the comparable masses , dynamically there is only a small difference between ejection of bn and ejection of @xmath134 , as named here .",
    "this is reflected in our results to some degree .",
    "cases 1 and 2 contribute towards creating the bn-@xmath8  system over very similar @xmath54 ranges .",
