    "one of the most important challenge of modern astronomy is the detection of young primeval galaxies .",
    "indeed , very significant progress has been made with the detection of very high redshift galaxies either from ground based observations ( steidel et al .",
    "1996b ) or in the hubble deep field ( e.g. steidel et al .",
    "1996a , lowenthal et al .",
    "1997 ) .    in order to understand the properties of high redshift galaxies and study the cosmological evolution of star - forming galaxies",
    ", it is crucial to properly characterize the properties of starburst galaxies in the local universe .",
    "these nearby galaxies are forming stars with a very high rate and it it actually important to analyse their emission over the entire spectral range ( from uv to fir - submm ) to study the efficiency of the dust extinction and know what is the spectral range ( uv , visible , nir or fir ) where most of their energy is emitted .",
    "if high redshift star forming galaxies are similar to their low - z counterparts studying the latter will bring some clues to detect the former .",
    "we can wonder whether the observation of the rest - frame uv continuum is the best way to detect high redshift galaxies or if the high obscuration from dust makes them emit more energy in the fir .",
    "iras discovered infrared bright galaxies with prodigious star formation rates , a very high extinction and therefore a low optical flux ( sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "the most luminous fir galaxies are produced by strong interactions or merging of molecular gas - rich galaxies which induce enormous starbursts .",
    "such objects might be the progenitors of elliptical galaxies ( kormendy & sanders 1992 ) . in a `` bottom - up '' scenario of galaxy formation",
    ", numerous starbursts induced by merging are expected and the bulk of their emission would be in the fir redshifted in the submm ( e.g. van der werf & israel 1996 ) .",
    "mazzei et al .",
    "( 1994 ) predict that more than 90 % of the energy emitted by a starburst is in the fir range during the first gyr .",
    "this percentage rapidly drops to reach @xmath2 for @xmath10 gyr- old objects .",
    "models aimed at explaining the galaxy counts in optical and fir predict that during intense phases of star formation the quasi totality of the stellar light is absorbed and re - radiated in the fir wavelength range ( franceschini et al .",
    "1994 , pearson & rowan - robinson 1996 ) .",
    "conversely , considerable effort has been carried out in the uv - optical study of star forming galaxies for some years .",
    "calzetti , kinney and co - workers have extensively used the iue spectra of star - forming galaxies complemented with optical and ir data to characterize the star formation history and the extinction occurring in the central regions of these objects ( calzetti et al .",
    "1994 , calzetti et al .",
    "1995 , calzetti 1997a ) .",
    "meurer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) have used faint object camera on board the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "hst - foc observations to study the morphology of some starburst galaxies . from these studies ,",
    "a foreground distribution of dust and a rather grey extinction curve seems to be able to explain the spectral distribution of the central regions of starburst galaxies .",
    "the extinction found by meurer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) for nearby starburst galaxies is rather low : at 2000 @xmath1 it lies between 0.08 and 1.9 mag ( excluding ngc7552 at 3.13 mag ) .",
    "nevertheless these studies deal with the central parts of starburst galaxies and may well not be valid for the global emission of these objects at least when longer wavelengths than uv are concerned ( buat et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "analyses of the uv - optical and fir global emissions of nearby spiral and irregular galaxies selected to be observed both in uv and in fir led to a rather low extinction ( xu & buat 1995 , buat & xu 1996 , wang & heckman 1996 ) .",
    "an important result of these studies is that the uv non - ionizing stellar emission is likely to be the major cause of dust heating .",
    "the contribution of ob stars to the dust heating is estimated to amount to about 20@xmath6 of the total fir emission in the milky way ( cox & mezger 1989 ) , almost the same contribution of the ionizing radiation to the dust heating is found for spiral galaxies ( xu & buat , 1995 ) and for starburst objects ( calzetti et al .",
    "the comparison between the fir emission ( dust re - radiation ) and the uv and optical emission ( escaped stellar light ) constrains the extinction . as a consequence",
    "the fir to uv continuum ratio is a powerful indicator of the extinction occurring in galaxies ( meurer et al .",
    "1995 , buat & xu 1996 , wang & heckman 1996 ) .",
    "recently , hst imaging of very high redshift galaxies complemented when possible by spectroscopic observations with the keck telescope have led to the discovery at high redshift ( z@xmath11 ) of compact star forming galaxies with a moderate size and a strong rest - frame uv emission ( steidel et al .",
    "1996a ) with sometimes more diffuse extended structures lowenthal et al .",
    "depending on the intrinsic uv spectrum adopted , the average extinction estimated at 1600 @xmath1 from the rest - frame uv spectral energy distribution of these galaxies is of the order of 1.7 to 3 mag ( meurer et al .",
    "1997 , calzetti 1997b ) .",
    "these significant average extinctions are therefore larger than the values estimated for nearby starburst galaxies .",
    "however , it must be noted that these high redshift galaxies are very luminous ( @xmath12 ) when compared to the mean luminosity of nearby starburst galaxies studied by meurer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) ( @xmath13 ) and the extinction is known to correlate with the luminosity of galaxies ( giovanelli et al .",
    "1995 , wang & heckman 1997 ) .",
    "moreover , the selection biases are very strong towards very luminous galaxies with a strong uv continuum and it can not be excluded that high redshift galaxies almost entirely hidden by the dust are missing from these observations in the rest - frame uv ( mobasher et al .",
    "1996 , burigana et al .",
    "1997 ) .    the selection biases in the recent detections of high z galaxies are difficult or even impossible to quantify in the absence of similar observations at other wavelengths corresponding to longer than uv rest frame emissions ( nir or fir ) .",
    "a first step is to estimate the importance of such a bias in the local universe .",
    "such a study is also crucial to compare the properties of high redshift galaxies to those in the nearby universe .    at this aim",
    "we will adopt a global approach to study the local universe which consists in comparing the luminosity functions and the luminosity densities in uv and fir .",
    "the uv wavelength range is particularly interesting since it is a tracer of the recent star formation rate as already mentioned and observations in the visible range of high z ( @xmath14 ) galaxies correspond to their uv rest frame emission .",
    "more specifically we will compare the amount of energy locked up in fir to the amount of energy directly emitted in uv in the local universe .",
    "the comparison of these global values with individual galaxies selected to be observed both in uv and fir will allow to discuss how such samples of individual galaxies are representative of the mean properties of the local universe .",
    "we will also investigate the specific case of a sub sample of nearby starburst galaxies detected in uv , visible , nir and fir in order to compare their global dust and stellar emission and to estimate what fraction of the emission of stars is converted into dust emission as well as the relative contribution of the uv , visible and nir spectral ranges to the observed stellar emission .",
    "such estimates will lead to predict what spectral range is more favorable for the detection of high redshift starbursts under the hypothesis that they are similar to their nearby counterparts .",
    "the main limitation to this approach is that we deal with global fluxes integrated over the galaxies whereas the starburst often occurs in the central parts .",
    "moreover the galaxies at high redshift so far detected seem to have compact morphologies",
    ". nevertheless as it will be shown in section 4 a large fraction of the uv emission of a starburst galaxy is likely to come from the starburst itself making valid a study on the global fluxes as soon as this wavelength is concerned .",
    "it is also the case for the fir emission since the uv ( ionizing and non ionizing ) emissions is the major contributor to the dust heating ) , especially in starbursting objects .",
    "obviously , more care must be taken when dealing with the visible and nir emission : at these wavelengths the contribution of the underlying old stellar population present in local starburst galaxies is very large even dominant .",
    "endly , available fir fluxes on large samples are integrated over the galaxies due to the poor resolution of the iras satellite and dealing with global fluxes allows a reliable comparison of the emission of galaxies at different wavelengths .    beyond the detection of high redshift star forming galaxies",
    "it is necessary to estimate a quantitative star formation rate ( sfr ) for these galaxies .",
    "the deduction of such a quantity from the observed rest - frame uv continuum relies almost entirely on the amount of the extinction with only a moderate dependence on the star formation history ( e.g. meurer et al .",
    "1997 , calzetti 1997 ) .",
    "more specifically after @xmath15 years of constant star formation rate the uv flux ( 912 - 3650 @xmath1 ) reaches 80 @xmath6 of its stationnary value calculated for @xmath16 years of constant star formation ( from bruzual & charlot 1993 ) . from a global energetic budget , we will try to constrain the amount of extinction and bring some clues to this difficult problem .",
    "our study is based on samples of galaxies detected in uv and for which fir data are available .",
    "we have used the uv observations ( @xmath17 ) of the balloon borne telescopes scap and foca ( donas et al .",
    "1987 , 1990 , 1995 ) together with those obtained with faust ( deharveng et al .",
    "the fir data come from the iras database .",
    "first , we will re - consider a first sample of 152 galaxies already compiled ( buat & xu 1996 ) in order to investigate the selection biases inherent to our selection .",
    "second , we built a sample of starburst galaxies .",
    "these starburst galaxies are selected according to their far - infrared color : @xmath18 .",
    "it ensures a dust temperature larger than 36k assuming a single temperature thermal model and a dust emissivity index equal to 1 in agreement with the definition of starburst galaxies adopted by pearson and rowan - robinson ( 1996 ) .",
    "these starburst galaxies are selected to be observed in uv photometry and by iras at 60 and 100 @xmath19 . for galaxies belonging to the coma , abell 1367 or virgo clusters ,",
    "the visible and nir data come from gavazzi et al .",
    "( 1996a , b ) , gavazzi & boselli ( 1996 and references therein ) , boselli et al . ( 1997 ) and boselli et al . ( 1998 , in preparation ) ; the fir data are compiled by gavazzi ( private communication ) .",
    "the data for non cluster galaxies are from de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "( 1991 , rc3 ) and the iras database .",
    "active galaxies are excluded .",
    "22 galaxies are selected and gathered in tab . 1 .",
    "most of the galaxies of this sample ( and all the nearest ones not belonging to coma or abell 1367 clusters ) are reported in the literature as experiencing a starburst .",
    "the distances of nearby galaxies are taken from tully ( 1988 ) .",
    "the distances to a1367 and coma clusters are taken to 87 and 92 mpc respectively .",
    "when the galaxies do not belong to a cluster and are not listed in tully s catalog , their radial velocity are taken from the rc3 and the distances computed assuming @xmath20 in consistency with tully ; h is defined as @xmath21 .",
    ".starburst galaxies ( @xmath22 ) detected to be observed in fir and uv .",

    "if we exclude the scenario of the old burst alone which can not describe a current starburst , @xmath26 from the models is larger than the mean value @xmath27 found for our sample ( table 2 ) by a factor ranging from 1.3 to 2.6 .",
    "the contribution of the visible - nir range becomes significant as soon as the galaxy is not experiencing a large burst with a short duration ( described as sb(10 myr ) in table 3 and involving 10@xmath6 of the stellar mass ) .",
    "although the statistics is poor ( only 12 objects ) the mean value found in table 2 for @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) is slightly larger than those obtained in table 3 for the models with a current starburst described by a constant star formation over 1 gyr ( csf(1 gyr ) ) by a factor 1.2 - 1.5 .",
    "the difference is much larger when a more recent starburst is considered ( sb(10 myr ) ) with a factor 3.4 between the mean value of the observations and the result of the models .",
    "the comparison in the uv range of the observations and the few models presented here seems to favor a rather moderate extinction in our sample of starburst galaxies . under the hypothesis of such a moderate extinction ,",
    "the analysis of the visible - nir range argues for a starburst lasting more than 10 myr ( at the scale of the entire galaxy ) to explain the rather large fraction of visible light emerging from these galaxies .",
    "a large fraction of the light emitted by the nearby starburst galaxies studied here is found in the uv wavelength range , at least in average .",
    "this might imply a moderate extinction . as discussed below , a reliable estimation of the extinction must account for the true spectral energy distribution of the stellar emission as well as assuming a realistic geometry for the repartition of dust and stars .    to estimate this extinction we first use a radiation transfer model in an infinite plan parallel geometry where",
    "stars and dust are mixed , different scale heights are assumed for stars emitting in uv or visible .",
    "this model treats the dust grains as frequency converters , converting the uv and optical radiation to the fir one .",
    "details on the model are given in xu & buat ( 1995 ) and buat & xu ( 1996 ) .",
    "a main result of this model based on an energy balance is that the uv non ionizing radiation dominates the dust heating in disk galaxies ( with starbursts or not , ( buat & xu 1996 ) ) .",
    "applying this model to our sample of starburst galaxies leads to a mean extinction at 2000 @xmath7 @xmath30 .",
    "therefore the extinction is effectively found to be moderate .",
    "actually , it has been found that the foreground screen geometry favoured by calzetti et al .",
    "( 1994 ) does not fit our data probably because we deal with integrated fluxes over the entire galaxies whereas the model of calzetti et al .",
    "is suited to the central regions of the galaxies where the starburst occurs ( buat et al .",
    "nevertheless , for the need of comparison with the high redshift objects ( see below ) we also use the extinction curve of calzetti et al .",
    "using an unreddened spectrum with a star formation rate constant over 1 gyr . since the uv light is likely to be the major source of dust heating , especially in starburst galaxies , we have considered the @xmath31 ratio .",
    "excluding the three galaxies with a @xmath31 ratio larger by a factor 30 or more than the ratios of the other sample galaxies ( see fig .",
    "5b ) , the mean value is @xmath32 . for comparison",
    "the median value of @xmath31 for the entire sample is 1.6 the mean value of this ratio corresponds to an extinction of 1.2 mag at 2000 @xmath1 in fully agreement with our previous estimate .",
    "the extinction we find in our sample of starburst galaxies is also consistent with the values estimated by meurer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) from the uv spectral slope for a sample of 9 nearby starburst galaxies .",
    "such a consistency is expected since our sample exhibits the same range of fir to uv ratios as that of meurer et al .",
    "we have considered galaxies selected to be detected photometrically both in uv and fir .",
    "an analysis of the local luminosity functions at both wavelengths shows that the galaxies selected in this way have a fir and a uv emission representative of the mean population of galaxies in the local universe . from a sample of 22 starburst galaxies , the mean escape fraction of the stellar light ( ratio of the stellar luminosity to the bolometric one )",
    "is found to be @xmath33 , i.e. similar to what is found for normal galaxies .",
    "this escape fraction exhibits a strong decrease with increasing galaxy luminosity ranging from @xmath34 at faintest b magnitudes ( @xmath35 ) to @xmath36 for @xmath37 .",
    "this result is quite different to that of pearson & rowan - robinson ( 1996 ) who found that the escape fraction of the stellar light in starburst galaxies can not exceed 5 - 10@xmath6 from an analysis of deep counts in visible and nir and assuming a very strong cosmological evolution for the starburst population .",
    "such a low fraction of escaped light is consistent with the studies of fir bright galaxies but seems not to be a generic property of starbursting objects , at least in the local universe .",
    "we can compare our results found for nearby starbursts to high redshift galaxies recently detected . a limitation to this comparison",
    "might be that we deal with integrated fluxes on nearby galaxies which contain an underlying stellar population pre - existing to the starburst .",
    "to our knowledge , there is no evidence for the presence or not of such an older population in high redshift starburst galaxies ( z @xmath38 3 ) .",
    "nevertheless , as discussed in the paper , the uv range is largely dominated by the emission of the newly formed stars and the comparison of the high redshift galaxies to present - day starburst ones in this wavelength range is justified .    from an analysis of the slope of the rest - frame uv continuum",
    ", an extinction has been estimated for high z galaxies ( meurer et al .",
    "1997 , calzetti 1997b , pettini et al .",
    "1997 ) . a mean extinction of 1.65 mag at 1650 @xmath1",
    "is found by calzetti for a star formation rate constant over @xmath9 gyr which implies an unreddened slope for the uv continuum @xmath39 .",
    "this value is in agreement with pettini et al.s estimates .",
    "meurer et al . have adopted a different star formation law with a starburst lasting 10 @xmath40 , leading to a larger proportion of very young stars and a steeper uv slope ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "such a very extreme scenario gives an extinction as large as 3 mag . at 1600 @xmath1 which can be considered as a very upper limit .",
    "the extinction found for nearby starburst galaxies is lower than the value found by calzetti or pettini et al . at high redshift .",
    "but the galaxies observed at high redshift are much more luminous that the nearby starburst galaxies studied by us or by meurer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) ( meurer et al . 1997 , lowenthal et al .",
    "1997 , pettini et al .",
    "1997 ) . as an example",
    ", an extinction of 1.6 mag at 1600 @xmath1 gives @xmath42 and @xmath43 using the extinction curve of calzetti et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , a foreground screen and a star formation rate constant over 1 gyr .",
    "extrapolating fig .  5 , these ratios correspond to the brightest galaxies with @xmath44 .",
    "if the trends found in fig.5 are mainly due to the extinction , the extinction estimated in high redshift star forming galaxies is in agreement with the values found for nearby starburst galaxies when the galaxy luminosity is accounted for .",
    "we must point out , however , that low luminosity galaxies ( @xmath45 ) would be detectable with a ngst - type telescope in a reasonable amount of time as far as @xmath46 ( if they exist ) . in a hierarchical scenario for the formation of the galaxies ,",
    "it is likely that such galaxies would outnumber the large luminous galaxies presently detected ( ellis 1997 ) .",
    "obviously the knowledge of the local universe properties in terms of the extinction occurring in galaxies as well as their spectral energy distribution , especially in the uv range , is essential to interpret the observations of the universe at high redshift .",
    "it is also crucial to predict the best way to detect young galaxies during a phase of intense star formation .",
    "we show that a comparison of the fir and uv emissions in nearby galaxies can bring some clues since these two emissions are very sensitive to the current star formation rate and to the extinction .",
    "a more straightforward method would be a systematic comparison of deep fields in uv and fir .",
    "such a preliminary comparison was already performed ( buat & xu 1996 ) using faust ( deharveng et al .",
    "1994 ) and iras observations on two 7.6@xmath47-wide fields in the central region of the virgo cluster .",
    "although the uv observations of faust were not very deep ( limiting flux @xmath48 at 1600 @xmath1 ) , we have searched for galaxies detected by iras without any uv detected counterpart .",
    "given the low sensitivity of the faust experiment , the lower limits obtained for the ratio of the fir to uv luminosity are within the range of values found for the galaxies detected at both wavelengths ( fig .",
    "4 in buat & xu 1996 ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the results found in this paper but needs to be confirmed with deeper observations .",
    "the uv observations carried out with the large field ( @xmath49 ) foca telescope ( e.g. donas et al . 1990 ) reach the magnitude 18 at 2000@xmath1 .",
    "unfortunately up to now the fir observations ( made by the iras satellite ) are not deep enough to be compared to these uv observations and we have to wait for new fir large field instruments like wire to perform such a comparison .",

    "<S> we study the fir and uv - visible properties of star forming galaxies in the nearby universe . </S>",
    "<S> this comparison is performed using the local luminosity functions at uv and fir wavelengths and on individual starburst galaxies for which photometric data from uv to nir and fir are available .    </S>",
    "<S> the fir and uv luminosity functions have quite different shapes  : the uv function exhibits a strong increase for low luminosity galaxies whereas the fir tail towards ultra luminous galaxies ( @xmath0 ) is not detected in uv . the comparison of the fir and uv local luminosity densities argues for a rather moderate extinction in nearby disk galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the galaxies selected to be detected in fir and uv are found to be located in the medium range of both luminosity functions .    </S>",
    "<S> an emphasis is made on starburst galaxies . for a sample of 22 of these objects </S>",
    "<S> , it is found that the uv ( 912 - 3650 @xmath1 ) , the visible ( 3600 - 12500 @xmath1 ) and the nir ( 12500 - 22000 @xmath1 ) wavelength range contribute @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively to the total emerging stellar emission ( for a subsample of 12 galaxies for the nir and visible light ) . </S>",
    "<S> the mean ratio of the dust to bolometric luminosity of these galaxies is 0.37@xmath50.22 similar to the ratio found for normal spiral galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> only 4 out of the 22 galaxies exhibit a very large extinction with more than 60@xmath6 of their energy emitted in the fir - submm range . </S>",
    "<S> the mean extinction at 2000@xmath7 is found to be @xmath8 mag although with a large dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> the uv , visible and nir emissions of our sample galaxies are consistent with a burst lasting over @xmath9 gyr . </S>",
    "<S> the conversion factor of the stellar emission into dust emission is found to correlate with the luminosity of the galaxies , brighter galaxies having a higher conversion factor . since our sample appears to be representative of the mean properties of the galaxy population in fir and uv , a very large conversion of the stellar light into dust emission </S>",
    "<S> can no longer be assumed as a general property of starburst galaxies at least in the local universe </S>",
    "<S> . instead a larger amount of energy emerging from the present starburst galaxies seems to come from the stars rather than from the dust .    </S>",
    "<S> we compare the uv properties of our local starburst galaxies to those of recently detected high redshift galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the larger extinction found in the distant galaxies is consistent with the trend we find for the nearby starburst galaxies namely the brighter the galaxies the lower the escape fraction of stellar light . </S>"
