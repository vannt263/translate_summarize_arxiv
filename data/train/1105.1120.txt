    "( 1999 ) using the observations of transition region and coronal explorer ( trace ) .",
    "nakariakov et al .",
    "( 1999 ) reported the detection of spatial oscillations in five coronal loops with periods ranging from 258 to 320 s. the decay time was @xmath4 min for an oscillation of @xmath5 mhz .",
    "also wang and solanki ( 2004 ) described a loop oscillation observed on 17 april 2002 by trace in 195 @xmath6 .",
    "they interpreted the observed loop motion as a vertical oscillation , with a period of 3.9 min and a decay time of 11.9 min .",
    "nakariakov et al .",
    "( 1999 ) obtained that the amplitude of the oscillations decreases by more than 50 percent in several oscillation periods . to estimate the energy flux of the euv kink oscillation observed by nakariakov et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , we use the maximum kinetic energy flux of an oscillating loop given by @xmath7 . where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the mass density , the peak loop velocity , the loop radius , the loop length , and the damping time of oscillation , respectively . taking @xmath13 km , @xmath14 gr @xmath15 for a typical coronal loop in active region and using @xmath16 km s@xmath17 and @xmath18 min given by nakariakov et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , we obtain the energy flux as @xmath19 erg @xmath20 s@xmath17 which is three orders of magnitude smaller than the radiated energy flux @xmath21 erg @xmath20 s@xmath17 in active regions ( see klimchuk 2006 ) .",
    "therefore , the energy flux in the euv kink oscillations is unlikely to be sufficient to cover heating of coronal loops .    since the discovery of the coronal green line during the 1869 eclipse which identified as fe xiv spectral line by grotrian ( 1939 )",
    ", different theories of coronal heating have been put forward and debated ( for reviews see , e.g. , hollweg 1991 : narain and ulmschneider 1996 ; walsh and ireland 2003 ; erdlyi 2004 , 2005 ; klimchuk 2006 ; erdlyi and ballai 2007 ; taroyan and erdlyi 2009 ) .",
    "ionson ( 1978 ) was first to suggest that the resonant absorption of mhd waves in coronal plasmas could be a primary mechanism in coronal heating .",
    "since then , much analytical and numerical work has been done on the subject .",
    "rae and roberts ( 1982 ) investigated both eikonal and differential equation approaches for the propagation of mhd waves in inhomogeneous plasmas .",
    "hollweg ( 1987a , b ) considered a dissipative layer of planar geometry to study the resonant absorption of coronal loops .",
    "davila ( 1987 ) derived the resonant heating rate in the low - beta compressible resistive mhd approximation with the shear viscosity and found that the heating does not depend explicitly on the dissipation coefficients .",
    "poedts , goossens , and kerner ( 1989 , 1990 ) developed a finite element code to elaborate on the resonant absorption of alfvn waves in circular cylinders .",
    "sakurai , goossens , and hollweg ( 1991a , b ) , goossens , hollweg , and sakurai ( 1992 ) , steinolfson and davila ( 1993 ) did much work on resonant absorption .",
    "ofman , davila , and steinolfson ( 1994 ) , and erdlyi and goossens ( 1994 ) included viscous and resistive dissipations in their analysis and concluded that the heating rate due to shear viscosity is comparable in magnitude to the resistive resonant heating .",
    "also , they concluded that the heating caused by compressive viscosity is negligible .",
    "goossens , ruderman , and hollweg ( 1995 ) extended the analysis of sakurai et al .",
    "( 1991b ) on resonant alfvn waves in nonuniform magnetic flux tubes for a static mhd equilibrium .",
    "they showed that the conservation law found in ideal mhd is valid in dissipative mhd .",
    "they derived analytical solutions to the dissipative mhd equations for the lagrangian displacement and for the total pressure perturbation .",
    "erdlyi and goossens ( 1995 ) studied the heating of solar coronal loops by resonant absorption of alfvn waves in visco - resistive mhd .",
    "they pointed out that under solar coronal conditions the two dissipative mechanisms are both operational and that electrical resistivity appears to be slightly more important than viscosity .",
    "erdlyi and goossens ( 1996 ) studied the effect of an equilibrium flow on resonant absorption of linear mhd waves in compressible viscous cylindrical magnetic flux tubes .",
    "they showed that the presence of the equilibrium flow is very determinant for resonant absorption and significantly affect the resonance absorption rate suffered by the incoming driving waves .",
    "goossens , andries , and aschwanden ( 2002 ) used the trace data of ofman and aschwanden ( 2002 ) to infer the width of the inhomogeneous layer for 11 coronal loops .",
    "ruderman and roberts ( 2002 ) solved the initial value problem for a zero - beta loop driven by a kink perturbation .",
    "they pointed out that the observed damping rate of the coronal oscillations is due to the resonant damping of the quasi - mode kink oscillations .",
    "they estimated the inhomogeneity length scale ( thickness of the boundary layer ) of the loop with the data of nakariakov et al .",
    "note that nakariakov et al .",
    "( 1999 ) showed that the damping rate of the global kink oscillation observed by the trace can be justified by the energy absorption due to anomalous viscosity . whereas ruderman and roberts ( 2002 ) cleared that for large values of the viscous reynolds number , the damping rate is independent of the viscous reynolds number and proportional to the ratio of the thickness of the inhomogeneous layer and the radius of the tube .",
    "van doorsselaere et al .",
    "( 2004a ) used the leda code ( large - scale eigenvalue solver for the dissipative alfvn spectrum ) to study the resistive absorption of the kink modes of cylindrical models .",
    "they concluded that , when the width of the nonuniform layer was increased , their numerical results differed by as much as 25 per cent from those obtained with the analytical approximation .",
    "safari et al .",
    "( 2006 ) studied the resonant absorption of mhd waves in magnetized flux tubes with a radial density inhomogeneity . using the approximation that resistive and viscous processes",
    "are operative in thin layers surrounding the singularities of the mhd equations , they concluded that as the longitudinal wave number increases , the maximum amplitude of the body eigenmodes shifts away from the resonant layer and causes a decrease in damping rates .",
    "an additional features of the flux tube is that of twist .",
    "there is observational evidence for the existence of twist in the solar atmosphere .",
    "the trace 171 @xmath6 observations of a postflare loop system on 1999 confirmed the existence of the twisted loops in the corona ( see aschwanden 2005 ) .",
    "rotational movement along a loop observed by chae et al .",
    "( 2000 ) indicates the existence of twist .",
    "aschwanden ( 2005 ) discusses observed noncoplanarity of loops which implies kinked field lines which , in turn , are also intimately related to twist . besides",
    ", it is unfeasible that every flux tube within the solar atmosphere is entirely twist free in spite of the random continuous motions observed at the footpoints ( see erdlyi and carter 2006 ) . following aschwanden ( 2005 )",
    ", the magnetic twist parameter @xmath22 can be estimated as @xmath23 . here",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 are the azimuthal and axial components of the magnetic field , respectively .",
    "also @xmath26 is the shear angle between the untwisted and the twisted field line .",
    "the geometric shear angle @xmath26 , can observationally be measured in twisted coronal loops .",
    "bennett , roberts , and narain ( 1999 ) examined the influence of magnetic twist on the modes of oscillations of a magnetic flux tube .",
    "they found that twist introduces an infinite band of body modes .",
    "erdlyi and fedun ( 2006 ) studied the wave propagation in a twisted cylindrical magnetic flux tube embedded in an incompressible but also magnetically twisted plasma .",
    "they found that increasing the external magnetic twist from 0 to 0.3 caused an increase in the normalized periods of sausage mhd waves approximately by 1@xmath272@xmath28 .",
    "erdlyi and fedun ( 2007 ) extended the work of erdlyi and fedun ( 2006 ) to the case of compressible plasma .",
    "they found that increasing the internal twist may result in about up to @xmath29 changes in periods for sausage modes .",
    "erdlyi and carter ( 2006 ) studied the propagation of mhd waves in a fully magnetically twisted flux tube consisting of a core , annulus and external region .",
    "they investigated their analysis by considering magnetic twist just in the annulus , the internal and external regions having straight magnetic field .",
    "two modes of oscillations occur in this configuration ; surface and hybrid modes .",
    "they found that when the magnetic twist is increased the hybrid modes cover a wide range of phase speeds , centered around the annulus , longitudinal alfvn speed for the sausage modes .",
    "carter and erdlyi ( 2007 ) investigated the oscillations of a magnetic flux tube configuration consisting of a core , annulus and external region each with straight distinct magnetic field in an incompressible medium .",
    "they found that there are two surface modes arising for both the sausage and kink modes for the annulus - core model where the monolithic tube has solely one surface mode for the incompressible case .",
    "also they showed that the existence and width of an annulus layer has an effect on the phase speeds and periods .",
    "carter and erdlyi ( 2008 ) used the model introduced by erdlyi and carter ( 2006 ) to include the kink modes .",
    "they found for the set of kink body modes , the twist increases the phase speeds of the modes .",
    "also they showed that there are two surface modes for the twisted shell configuration , one due to each surface , where one mode is trapped by the inner tube , the other by the annulus itself .",
    "mikhalyaev and solovev ( 2005 ) investigated the mhd waves in a double magnetic flux tube embedded in a uniform external magnetic field .",
    "the tube consists of a dense hot cylindrical core surrounded by a co - axial shell .",
    "they found two slow and two fast magnetosonic modes can exist in the thin double tube .",
    "verwichte et al . ( 2004 ) , using the observations of trace , detected multimode oscillations for the first time .",
    "they found that two loops are oscillating in both the fundamental and the first - overtone standing kink modes . according to the theory of mhd waves , for uniform loops",
    "the ratio of the period of the fundamental to the period of the first overtone is exactly 2 , but the ratios found by verwichte et al .",
    "( 2004 ) are 1.81@xmath300.25 and 1.64@xmath300.23 .",
    "however , these values were corrected with the improvement of the observational error bars to 1.82@xmath300.08 and 1.58@xmath300.06 , respectively , by van doorsselaere , nakariakov , and verwichte ( 2007 ) .",
    "also verth , erdlyi , and jess ( 2008 ) added some further corrections by considering the very important effects of loop expansion and estimated a period ratio of 1.54 .",
    "all these values clearly differ from 2 .",
    "this may be caused by different factors such as the effects of curvature ( see e.g. van doorsselaere et al .",
    "2004b ) , leakage ( see de pontieu , martens , and hudson 2001 ) , density stratification in the loops ( see e.g. andries et al . 2005 ; erdlyi and verth 2007 ; karami and asvar 2007 ; safari , nasiri , and sobouti 2007 ; karami , nasiri , and amiri 2009 ) , magnetic field expansion ( see verth and erdlyi 2008 ; ruderman , verth , and erdlyi 2008 ; verth et al .",
    "2008 ) and magnetic twist ( see e.g. erdlyi and fedun 2006 , 2007 ; erdlyi and carter 2006 ; karami and barin 2009 ) .",
    "karami and barin ( 2009 ) studied both the oscillations and damping of standing mhd surface and hybrid waves in coronal loops in presence of twisted magnetic field .",
    "they considered a straight cylindrical incompressible flux tube with magnetic twist just in the annulus and straight magnetic field in the internal and external regions .",
    "they showed that both the frequencies and damping rates of both the kink and fluting modes increase when the twist parameter increases .",
    "they obtained that the period ratio @xmath2 of the fundamental and first - overtone for both the kink and fluting surface modes are lower than 2 ( for untwisted loop ) in presence of the twisted magnetic field .",
    "ruderman ( 2007 ) studied nonaxisymmetric oscillations of thin twisted magnetic tubes in a zero - beta plasma by taking into account the longitudinal density stratification . using the asymptotic analysis",
    ", he showed that the eigenmodes and eigenfrequencies of the kink and fluting oscillations are described by a classical sturm - liouville problem for a second - order ordinary differential equation .",
    "he also concluded that the results concerning nonaxisymmetric waves in twisted magnetic tubes obtained by bennett et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for incompressible plasmas can be applied to global nonaxisymmetric waves , i.e. kink and fluting modes , in coronal loops despite that the coronal plasma is a low - beta plasma .",
    "this conclusion was also in a good agreement with erdlyi and fedun ( 2007 ) .",
    "in the present work , our aim is to investigate the effect of twisted magnetic field on the resonant absorption of standing mhd waves in the coronal loops to justify the rapid damping of oscillations and deviation of the period ratio @xmath2 from 2 observed by trace .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we derive the equations of motion , introduce the relevant connection formulae and obtain the dispersion relation . in section 3",
    "we give numerical results .",
    "section 4 is devoted to conclusions .",
    "the linearized mhd equations for an incompressible plasma are @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the eulerian perturbations in the velocity , magnetic field and thermal pressure , respectively ; @xmath8 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the mass density , the electrical conductivity , the viscosity and the speed of light , respectively . in the momentum",
    "( [ mhd1 ] ) like ruderman and roberts ( 2002 ) we write the viscous force in a simplified form @xmath40 instead of the classical braginskii s expression for the viscosity tensor in a magnetized plasma ( braginskii 1965 ) . because according to ruderman and roberts ( 2002 ) , under typical coronal conditions , the coefficient of the shear viscosity is at least 10 orders of magnitude smaller than that of the compressional viscosity .",
    "however , in the problem of oscillations of coronal loops , dissipation is only important in an alfvnic dissipative layer embracing an ideal resonant magnetic surface .",
    "numerical studies by ofman et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , and erdlyi and goossens ( 1994 , 1995 ) have shown that in alfvnic dissipative layers only the shear viscosity is significant , all other terms in braginskii s tensorial expression being neglected .",
    "equation ( [ mhd3 ] ) satisfies the incompressibility condition .",
    "the assumption of incompressibility reduces the direct full applicability to coronal loops except for kink modes observed by the trace as they are highly incompressible perturbations ( see carter and erdlyi 2007 ) .",
    "recently goossens et al .",
    "( 2009 ) showed that in the thin tube approximation neglecting contributions proportional to @xmath41 then the frequency of the kink wave and its damping due to resonant absorption are the same in the three cases including a compressible pressureless plasma , an incompressible plasma and a compressible plasma which allows for mhd radiation .",
    "this is expected as kink modes are linearly incompressible .",
    "note that here the energy equation is absent .",
    "because for incompressible plasmas when sound speed ( or adiabatic gas index ) goes to infinity then the energy equation is decoupled from the system of linearized mhd equations .",
    "the simplifying assumptions are as follows .    * the background magnetic field",
    "is assumed to be @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 are constant and the magnetic field is uniformly twisted inside and outside the tube ( see fig .",
    "[ rho_va_bphi_p_ptot ] ) .",
    "this is unphysical as @xmath45 , and caution has to be exercised .",
    "following ruderman ( 2007 ) , to satisfy the shafranov - kruskal stability criterion we assume that the azimuthal component of magnetic field is smaller than the axial component .",
    "this assumption is also compatible with observed weakly twisted coronal loops ( see erdlyi and fedun 2006 ) .",
    "the stability of a twisted magnetic flux tube has been studied in some details by bennett et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , ruderman ( 2007 ) , and carter and erdlyi ( 2008 ) .",
    "note that the choice of @xmath46 implies that there is a constant longitudinal current density along the flux tube . * from safari et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and karami et al .",

    "[ rho_va_bphi_p_ptot ] ) .",
    "note that for resonant absorption a number of density profiles have been considered .",
    "for instance , ofman et al . ( 1994 , 1995 ) have taken @xmath51 with @xmath52 . here",
    "since we use the thin boundary approximation , we assume that the inhomogeneous layer and the resonance layer coincide ( see goossens et al .",
    "therefore any well behavior function of the density like that selected by ofman et al .",
    "( 1994 , 1995 ) in the resonance layer , i.e. the region @xmath53 where the singularity occurs , can be approximated with a linearly varying profile . *",

    "since we have no discontinuity in the background magnetic field , then the thermal pressure remains continuous across @xmath58 ( see fig .",

    "this is due to existence of the resonant absorption which is absent in their work .",

    "iv ) for a given @xmath118 and @xmath22 , when the azimuthal mode number , @xmath117 , increases , the frequencies and damping rates increase but the ratio @xmath130 decreases .    here in our calculations , the sausage modes ( @xmath142 )",
    "are absent . because following edwin and roberts ( 1983 ) , and roberts , edwin , and benz ( 1984 ) , the sausage modes have a cut - off longitudinal wave number @xmath143 , and they are only expected in fat and dense loops . according to aschwanden ( 2005 ) the longitudinal wave number cut - off @xmath143 for sausage - mode oscillations",
    "is expressed as a requirement of the loop length - to - width ratio @xmath144 as a function of the density contrast @xmath145 between the external and internal loop densities .",
    "for instance , for a typical active region , loops which have a density contrast of the order of @xmath146 would be required to have length - to - width ratios of @xmath147 .",

    "figure shows that for both kink and fluting modes , the period ratio @xmath2 decreases when the twist parameter increases .",
    "for instance , @xmath2 decreases from 2 ( for untwisted loop ) and approaches below 1.6 , 1.2 and 1.1 for @xmath117 = ( 1 , 2 and 3 ) , respectively , with increasing the twist parameter .",
    "note that when the twist is zero , the diagrams of @xmath2 do not start exactly from 2 .",
    "this may be caused by the radial structuring @xmath148 .",
    "but for the selected thin tube with @xmath98 , this departure is very small , @xmath149 for kink ( @xmath0 ) and @xmath150 for fluting ( @xmath151 ) modes , and does not show itself in the diagrams ( see mcewan et al .",
    "figure [ surface - p1p2 ] clears that for kink modes @xmath152 , the ratio @xmath2 is 1.821 when @xmath22=0.0065 , and is 1.584 for @xmath22=0.0212 .",
    "these are in good agreement with the period ratios observed by van doorsselaere et al .",

    "( 2007 ) considered only the effect of density stratification and neglected the effect of loop expansion .",
    "it has been shown by verth and erdlyi ( 2008 ) that failure to take account of the flux tube expansion causes the density scale height to be overestimated by a factor of approximately 2 .",
    "verth et al .",

    "they reported a period ratio of 1.54 deduced from the observations of trace for the kink modes . here in our numerical calculations , if we take @xmath22=0.0255 and @xmath153 then we can obtain the period ratio @xmath2=1.539 for the kink modes which is in good agreement with that reported by verth et al .",
