    "we present the results of the measurements performed by the  and belle collaborations , to determine the value of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) _ cp _ violating phase @xmath0 ( @xmath13}$ ] ) .",
    "these measurements are based on the studies done with the charged @xmath6 decays , , and , where  indicates either a  or a  meson .",
    "they are based on the interference of the amplitudes proportional to the @xmath8 and @xmath7 ckm - matrix elements that generate asymmetries through direct _",
    "violation effects associated to the electroweak ( _ ew _ ) phase @xmath0 carried by the @xmath7 amplitude .",
    "these measurements are at the present time the most constraining ones , but neutral @xmath6 decays such as @xmath9 and @xmath10 are also used to extract constraints on @xmath11 , as -  mixing is present in addition to the above described direct _",
    "violation phenomenon .",
    "the sensitivity to the @xmath7 amplitude is relatively small for these decays , so it has been proposed to use the rare decays  where larger _ cp _ asymmetries are expected .    at the time of this conference",
    "the two asymmetric - energy colliders pep - ii at slac and kek@xmath6 at kek have produced a huge quantity of data at the  resonance .",
    "@xcite and belle  @xcite detectors have integrated over @xmath14  of data ( respectively about @xmath15  and @xmath16  ) .",
    "this corresponds to a sample of more than one billion  pairs collected .",
    "it can be noticed that the measurements presented here are all statistically limited and most of them use only a fraction of the currently available dataset .",
    "it is therefore crucial that they will be updated soon .",
    "methods are exploited  @xcite , where the decays either to a _",
    "cp _ eigenstate ( _ glw _ method ) , or to a doubly cabibbo - suppressed flavor decay ( dcsd ,  wrong sign \" decay , _ ads _ method ) , or to the   final state , for which a dalitz analysis has to be performed ( _ ggsz _ method ) . to extract @xmath0 ,",
    "those three methods are all based on the fact that a  can decay into a color - allowed ( color - suppressed ) final state via @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) transitions .",
    "the amplitude @xmath19 of the @xmath17 transition is proportional to @xmath20 and the amplitude @xmath21 of the @xmath18 transition to @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 is the related to the cabibbo angle ) .",
    "the second amplitude therefore carries both the _ ew _ @xmath0 _ cp _ phase and the relative strong phase of those two transitions . as the total amplitude for the  decay is the sum of the two amplitudes @xmath24 and @xmath25",
    ", the two amplitudes interfere when the  and  decay into the same final state .",
    "this interference leads to different and  decay rates ( direct _ cp _ violation ) .",
    "these methods apply to the two other charged @xmath6 decays : and , as well .",
    "the various methods are  theoretically clean \" because the main contributions to the amplitudes come from tree - level transitions , in an excellent approximation .",
    "in addition to the parameters and to the strong phase , @xmath25 is significantly reduced with respect to @xmath26 by the color - suppression phenomenon .",
    "one usually defines the parameter @xmath27 that determines the size of the direct _ cp _ asymmetry .",
    "it is a critical parameter for these analyses .",
    "its value is predicted  @xcite to lie in the range @xmath28 as it has been argued that color - suppression may not be as important as expected from naive factorization in charmed b decays  @xcite .",
    "the smaller @xmath29 is , the smaller is the experimental sensitivity to @xmath0 .",
    "as the three decays modes , , and  are used , one should remark that 7 parameters have to be extracted from the three used methods : the common _ ew _ phase @xmath0 and the nuisance parameters for the measurements , i.e. , a respective strong phase  @xmath30 \" and an  @xmath31 \" parameter for each of the three modes : @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .    the ckm - angle @xmath0 , and the parameters  @xmath29 \" , and  @xmath30 \" can be measured experimentally by two quantities ( asymmetry and ratio of branching ratios ) :    @xmath36    @xmath37    for @xmath38",
    ", the denominator is built with branching ratios of specific flavor  decays .",
    "for the _ glw _ method  @xcite the   is reconstructed in various _",

    ". the total branching ratio of each considered decay mode , including secondary decays is relatively small ( @xmath47 or less ) . as many modes are taken into account to reconstruct the  it is anyway possible to have enough signal events to study asymmetries , but this technique is obviously strongly statistically limited .",
    "so the small _ cp _ asymmetry ( @xmath48 ) and the rareness of these  _ cp _ eigenstate modes , make this method difficult with the present @xmath6 factories dataset .    in the _ glw _",

    "only three are independent , as : = - .",
    "the observable  is normalized to the branching ratios as obtained from three flavor state decays : @xmath46 , , and . in principle with infinite statistics",
    "this method is very clean to determine @xmath0 , but up to an 8 fold - ambiguity , as the above equations show .",
    "it can be noticed from the definition of  that the sensitivity to the nuisance parameter @xmath51 is quite weak , as it is expected to be much smaller than unity .",
    "the  @xcite and belle  @xcite collaborations have published results based on a limited fraction only of their full available dataset .",

    "the channel is the one with the highest sensitivity to @xmath0  @xcite because of the best overall combination of branching ratio magnitude , -  interference and background level .",
    "this mode offers a reasonably high branching ratio ( @xmath104 , including secondary decays ) and a clean experimental signature ( only charged tracks in the final state ) .",
    "the decay mode  can be accessed through many intermediate states :  wrong sign \" or  right \" @xmath44 resonances ( such as @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , or @xmath109 ) , _ cp _ eigenstates @xmath110 , @xmath42 , or @xmath111 , ... therefore , an analysis of the amplitude of the decay over the @xmath112 vs @xmath113 ( i.e. : @xmath114 vs @xmath115 ) dalitz plane structure is sensitive to the same kind of observable as for both the _ glw _ and _ ads _ methods , and obviously carries more information .",

    "as opposed to the previously described neutral @xmath6 decays , it is feasible to extract both @xmath270 and @xmath221 coefficients , so that no theoretical assumption nor any model is needed to measure @xmath266 , @xmath271 , and @xmath269 at the same time .",
    "so far , belle with @xmath272  pairs and  @xcite with @xmath273  pairs , have measured the branching ratios of these decays .",
    "they lie in the range @xmath274 , while the mode @xmath275 has not yet been observed .",
    "the most precise upper limit for its branching fraction is @xmath276 at 90  % c.l .. it is then obvious that no direct measurement of @xmath269 is yet accessible .    using the self tagging decay @xmath277 , it is possible to estimate the ratio @xmath278 .",

    ",  @xcite has set the upper limit @xmath288 at 90  % of c.l .. this suggests that , as the branching fraction of the decay @xmath289 is still unknown , that this technique is still not yet powerful enough with the existing @xmath6 factories dataset and will not even be in near future .",
    "we have presented a review on the measurements of the ckm - angle @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) as performed at the @xmath6 factories pep - ii and kek@xmath6 by  and belle collaborations .",
    "these measurements were considered as more or less impossible for these experiments a few years ago .",
    "thought we have not yet entered the era of precision , many methods using charged or neutral @xmath6-decays have been employed , pioneering the measurements at the future lhcb experiment , or possibly at future super @xmath6 factories .    before to get there , the present existing @xmath6 factories will have to update these results with already existing additional dataset and non negligible forthcoming statistics .",
    "in addition , many refinements and new methods continue to be developed  @xcite .",
    "one can therefore anticipate substantial improvements .",
    "all the machinery is in place , but all these measurements are by far dominated by statistics uncertainty .",
    "puzzles remain such as the exact value of the @xmath29 that sizes the sensitivity to @xmath0 and that is always exploited in each of the previously described methods",
    ". the bigger it is , the shorter will be the way to precision era .",
    "so far the _ ggsz _ method exploiting the dalitz decay @xmath46  in charged @xmath6 decays @xmath290 continues to provide us with the most powerful constraint on @xmath0 . the dalitz model systematic uncertainty",
    "is not yet a concern at the present time .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to reduce the model dependence systematic uncertainty by using the original idea of the ggsz method  @xcite . using cleo - c and future @xmath291-charm factories it is possible  @xcite to produce at the @xmath292 resonance coherent states of  and pairs .",
    "the amplitude @xmath127 is no more fitted but replaced by event yields of _ cp _ and flavor tagged @xmath293 within bins of the dalitz plan . with the existing cleo - c statistics ( 280  corresponding to about 570 _ cp _ tagged events ) this method should help reducing this uncertainty down to @xmath294 . for a projection to about 750  , corresponding to about 1500 _ cp _ tagged events",

    "should ultimately be able to measure @xmath0 , in a model - independent way , with an accuracy of the order of @xmath296 .",
    "to conclude , we present on figure  [ fig : gammackm ] the combination on the constraints on @xmath0 obtained with the charged @xmath6 decays .",
    "the present fit  @xcite is performed with the hfag  @xcite combinations of 32 observables ( the , , , and _ cartesian coordinates _ ) to extract 11 physics constants ( we have evaluated the strong phases and relative amplitudes ratios for @xmath293 decays to @xmath93 and @xmath297 modes ) .",
    "the value @xmath298 is extracted .",
    "this is coherent with the 1  @xmath253 interval from a global ckm coherence fit where these measurement are absent : @xmath299 . at 90  % of c.l .",
    "one gets from that fit : @xmath300 , @xmath301 , and @xmath302 . adding the information coming from the constraint on @xmath258 a slightly more precise value is obtained : @xmath12 .",
    "i would like to thank the organizers and especially peter krizan and his team , for the choice of the beautiful location of bled lake for that conference .",
