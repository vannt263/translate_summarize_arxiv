    "for example , in @xcite cabling was used to better understand open book decompositions of contact structures ; in particular , leading to non - positive monodromy maps supporting stein fillable contact structures , monoids in the mapping class group associated to contact geometry and procedures to construct open books on manifolds after allowable transverse surgery ( from an open book for the original contact manifold ) . moreover , the first classification of a non - transversely simple knot type was done in @xcite for the @xmath12-cable of the @xmath12-torus knot . in that paper",
    "it was also shown that studying solid tori with convex boundary that represent a given knot type ( that is , their core curves are in a given knot type ) is key to understanding cables ; such an analysis for solid tori representing negative torus knots yielded simple legendrian and transverse classifications for cables of negative torus knots .",
    "tori representing iterated cables of torus knots were further studied in @xcite as well as @xcite .",
    "building on these works we completely classify embeddings of solid tori representing positive torus knots and use this to give a complete classification of legendrian and transverse knots in the knot types of cables of positive torus knots .    before discussing the technical classification results we state qualitative versions that demonstrate new phenomena in the geography of legendrian knots .",
    "we begin with some notation . given a topological knot type @xmath13 and integers @xmath14 and @xmath15 we denote by @xmath16 the set of legendrian knots ( up to legendrian isotopy ) topologically isotopic to @xmath13 and by @xmath17 we similarly denote the set of transverse knots isotopic to @xmath13 by @xmath18 and the ones having self - linking number @xmath19 by @xmath20 .",

    "moreover , these non - destabilizable knots must be stabilized until their self - linking number is @xmath41 before they become transversely isotopic .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that there are knot types , specifically certain twist knots , that have arbitrarily many transverse knots with the same self - linking number .",
