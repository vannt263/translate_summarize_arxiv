    "the formation of protostellar discs under the influence of magnetic fields has received a great deal of attention for about one decade  ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in these works a highly idealised numerical setup usually consisting of an overall core rotation and a magnetic field parallel to the rotation axis was used .",
    "one common finding of these simulations is that for an initial setup with a magnetic field strength comparable to observations , i.e. a mass - to - flux ratio smaller than 5  10  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , no rotationally supported discs were found .",
    "this result is also called the  magnetic braking catastrophe  owing to the fact that magnetic braking is responsible for the removal of the angular momentum which would be necessary to form the discs",
    ". however , these results seem to be in contrast to recent high - resolution observations revealing the existence of keplerian discs around class 0 protostellar objects  ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .    trying to circumvent this",
    " magnetic braking catastrophe  by the inclusion of non - ideal mhd effects seems to fail .",
    "for instance the inclusion of ambipolar diffusion  ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) does not result in the formation of keplerian discs in the earliest phase of protostellar evolution .",
    "furthermore , ohmic dissipation does also not allow for large - scale ( @xmath1 100 au ) but only for very small ( @xmath1 10 solar radii ) rotationally supported structures  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , unless one assumes an unusually high resistivity  @xcite .",
    "even the combined effects of ambipolar diffusion and ohmic dissipation can not reduce the magnetic braking efficiency significantly  @xcite .",
    "recently , a third non - ideal mhd effect namely the hall effect was shown to enable the formation of keplerian discs  @xcite . however , this seems to require a hall coefficient about one order of magnitude larger than expected under realistic conditions .",
    "furthermore , the formation of a disc in these simulations is not due to a reduced magnetic braking efficiency but due to the spin - up of the gas in the midplane by the hall effect as the authors clearly demonstrated by the occurrence of a disc spinning in the opposite direction than the surrounding protostellar core .    as mentioned before",
    ", all the simulations use a highly idealised setup of a uniformly rotating core and a magnetic field parallel to the rotation axis .",
    "only recently have the effects of deviating from such a highly idealised setup been included .",
    "@xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite investigated how an inclination between the overall magnetic field and the core rotation affects the formation of keplerian discs .",
    "the authors found that even for a moderate inclination the formation of rotationally supported discs is possible .",
    "however , as  @xcite pointed out recently , for a realistic distribution of magnetic field strengths and misalignment angles , this would lead to a fraction of keplerian discs between 10  50% only . in an alternative approach ,",
    "the inclusion of turbulent motions in the initial conditions and their effect on the formation of rotationally supported discs was studied  @xcite , again showing the possibility of forming keplerian discs for strong magnetic fields . @xcite",
    "attribute the formation to turbulent reconnection occurring in the region of the disc , which in turn reduces the magnetic flux and thus the magnetic braking efficiency .",
    "in contrast , in  @xcite we suggest that the build - up of keplerian discs is due to the turbulent motions in the surroundings of the discs rather than due to magnetic flux loss .",
    "these motions distort the magnetic field and hamper the build - up of a toroidal magnetic field component responsible for angular momentum extraction , but simultaneously provide a sufficient amount of angular momentum necessary for disc formation .",
    "in this work we investigate this  as we call it  turbulence - induced formation mechanism in more detail and for a wider range of initial conditions . in  @xcite we tested this mechanism only for a massive molecular cloud of 100 m@xmath0 and supersonic turbulence .",
    "since we consider the turbulent motions to be the main driver of the formation of keplerian discs , it is particularly interesting to test this mechanism for the weaker case of subsonic turbulence . as subsonic turbulence is expected to dominate in low - mass molecular cloud cores , we extend our analysis also to the low - mass range .",
    "moreover , we study if or to what extent the turbulence - induced formation mechanism depends on the presence of an overall uniform rotation .",
    "we show that in the presence of turbulence in essentially any case keplerian discs are formed by the aforementioned mechanism .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : techniques ] we present the details of the initial conditions of the simulations and briefly describe the numerical techniques .",
    "the result of the simulations are presented are in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "first , we present the details of the keplerian discs formed and analyse possible reasons for their formation .",
    "next , we consider the time evolution of global disc properties before studying the fragmentation properties of the discs in more detail . in section",
    "[ sec : discussion ] the results are discussed in a broader context and are compared to related numerical and observational work before we summarise our main findings in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we now describe the setup of the different simulations .",
    "we performed several simulations with core masses ranging from to 2.6 m@xmath0 to 1000 m@xmath0 ( see table  [ tab : models ] for an overview over the different models and their parameters ) .",
    "all cores are embedded in a cubic box with a length of approximately three times the cores diameter to avoid corruption of the results by boundary effects .",
    "the ambient medium has a density a factor of 100 lower than the density at the edge of the cores , hence its dynamical influence can be considered negligible . the runs 2.6-norot - m2 and 2.6-rot - m2 have a core mass of 2.6 m@xmath0 and a gas temperature of 15 k. here",
    "we note that the first part in the name of each run denotes the mass - to - flux ratio , the second whether a uniform rotation is present or not , and the third the ( approximate ) core mass in m@xmath0 .",
    "the remaining runs with higher core masses have a initial temperature of 20 k , thus somewhat higher than in the low - mass cores  ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in all runs we set up a kolmogorov - type turbulence field so that 3d - turbulent rms mach number ( @xmath2 ) ranges from subsonic turbulence ( @xmath3 ) in the low - mass runs to strongly supersonic turbulence in the high - mass cases ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "these values represent the typical level of turbulence observed in molecular cloud cores  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* but see also the review of  @xcite and references therein ) and result in a ratio of the turbulent energy to gravitational energy @xmath5 of about 0.08 to 0.12 ( see table  [ tab : models ] ) . here",
    "the gravitational energy is determined from the analytical expression for the given density profile ( see further down ) of 0.04 was given .",
    "this value resulted from the calculation of the gravitational energy from the simulation data not taking into account a systematic offset in the numerical gravitational potential compared to the analytical value , which results in the somewhat lower value for @xmath6 . ] .",
    "for the runs with 100 m@xmath0 we performed several simulations in order to test to what extent the results depend on the random realisations of the turbulence field ( seed a , b , and c ) .",
    "we found that the results do not change qualitatively if the turbulence field is varied  ( but see * ? ? ? * for a detailed discussion ) . in some of the runs in addition",
    "we superimpose a rigid rotation of the core around the @xmath7-axis on the turbulent velocity field . for the sake of simplicity the rotation frequency in these runs",
    "is chosen such that the rotation energy equals the turbulent kinetic energy , i.e. @xmath8 . all cores are threaded by a magnetic field parallel to the @xmath7-axis .",
    "the strength of the field declines with increasing cylindrical radius @xmath9 as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the density in the midplane at the radius @xmath9 .",
    "this guarantees that @xmath12 is constant in the equatorial plane , where @xmath13 is the thermal pressure .",
    "furthermore , in order to guarantee @xmath14 , @xmath15 does not vary along the @xmath7-axis .",
    "the strength of the magnetic field is chosen such that the ( normalised ) mass - to - flux ratio @xmath16 of the cores is 2.6 .",
    "we emphasise that throughout the paper the mass - to - flux ratio is given in units of the critical mass - to - flux ratio @xmath17  @xcite , where @xmath18 is the gravitational constant .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      next , we consider the velocity structure in the discs in more detail .",
    "for this purpose we calculate the rotation velocity @xmath19 and the radial velocity @xmath20 for each cell in the disc .",
    "we note that the calculation is done in the rest - frame of the discs , i.e. the @xmath7-axis is defined by the disc angular momentum vector and the velocity is corrected by the velocity of the disc s centre - of - mass before calculating @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "in contrast to the column density plots presented before we restrict the consideration to the final snapshot at the end of each simulation .",
    "however , we emphasise that when considering the velocity structure at earlier times , the results do not change qualitatively as could already be inferred from the velocity vectors shown in the column density plots .",
    "furthermore , we note that for radii larger than @xmath1 50 au ( depending on the actual simulation ) , where no cells with gas densities above @xmath21 g @xmath22 are found , we adopt a simple geometrical criterion considering all the gas within a height of 20 au above / below the midplane defined by the disc .",
    "hence , we are able to analyse the velocity structure also outside the disc defined by the density threshold . in order to get an impression of the scatter of @xmath19 and @xmath20 ,",
    "the values are not averaged azimuthally .",
    "the keplerian velocity @xmath23 is calculated by taking into account the mass of gas and all sink particles within a sphere of radius @xmath24 around the centre of the disc .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : velm2 - 100 ] we plot the radial dependence of @xmath19 and @xmath20 for the four discs in the runs 2.6-norot - m2 , 2.6-rot - m2 , 2.6-norot - m100 and 2.6-rot - m100 and in fig .",

    "the radial velocity on the other hand scatters around zero as expected for a keplerian disc and is in general significantly smaller than the rotation velocity .",
    "interestingly , for some of the runs the keplerian velocity structure extends up to @xmath1 100 au and thus even beyond the disc radius inferred from the column density plots .",
    "this result is in strong contrast to a series of star formation simulations in which turbulence is neglected  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in general , in these simulations it was found that for mass - to - flux ratios below 5 - 10 , i.e. for moderately strong magnetic fields , no rotationally supported discs are formed .",
    "again , we stress that these results are due to the particular choice of the initial conditions namely the omission of turbulence . on the other hand , if turbulence is taken into account , recently the build - up of early - type keplerian discs was reported even for strong magnetic fields  @xcite .    as demonstrated in this section ,",
    "the build - up of keplerian discs does not depend on the mass of the prestellar core  and hence also not on the strength of the turbulence , which ranges from subsonic motions for the low - mass cores to highly supersonic motions for the most massive cores .",
    "furthermore , for the 2.6 m@xmath0 and 100 m@xmath0 cores it can be seen that the lack of an overall core rotation does not significantly affect the build - up of keplerian discs since turbulence always produces local shear flows which carry a sufficient amount of angular momentum to build up the discs . for both cases , the rotating and the non - rotating , keplerian discs build up in the low - mass and high - mass case",
    "however , a close inspection fig .",
    "[ fig : diskm2 ] and  [ fig : diskm100 ] shows that in the case of an overall core rotation the discs seem to be slightly larger than for the non - rotation case .",
    "this statement , however , has to be taken with caution since we obviously require a larger number of discs in order to obtain statistically significant results",
    ". nevertheless , our result of slightly larger discs for uniformly rotating cores agrees with what one would naively expect .    to summarise , the mechanism of turbulence - induced disc formation as proposed recently in  @xcite works for a wide range of core masses , turbulence strengths , and even for cores without uniform initial rotation .",
    "we again emphasise that the keplerian disc structure seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : velm2 - 100 ] and  [ fig : velm300 - 1000 ] at 15 kyr is present at much earlier times already , i.e. as early as 5 kyr .",
    "assuming rotation velocities of a few km s@xmath26 at a radius of 100 au , this time corresponds to about one to a few rotation periods of the disc  and correspondingly more at smaller radii indicating that keplerian discs build up in the very beginning . in the following",
    "we will explore this mechanism and the differences to the non - turbulent case in more detail .",
    "the extensive work on disc formation under the influence of magnetic fields has revealed a critical value for the mass - to - flux ratio of 5  10 below which the formation of keplerian discs is suppressed in collapsing cloud cores without turbulent motions  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the following we test to what extent the formation of keplerian discs in our simulations can be explained by the loss of magnetic flux in the discs vicinity . for this purpose",
    "we calculate the mass - to - flux ratio @xmath16 in spheres of radius @xmath24 = 500 au around the centre - of - mass of the discs formed in the four runs 2.6-norot - m2 , 2.6-rot - m2 , 2.6-norot - m100 and 2.6-rot - m100 .",
    "we note that we have chosen a radius of 500 au for a particular reason : by calculating the gas torque and the magnetic torque in  @xcite we have shown that a large fraction of the angular momentum is removed already _ before _ the gas falls onto the disc .",
    "the analysis showed that up to a distance of 500  1000 au from the centre of the disc the ( negative ) magnetic torque balances the ( positive ) inwards angular momentum transport by the gas  ( see bottom panel of fig .",
    "11 in * ? ? ?",
    "hence , this result clearly illustrates the importance to check what happens on scales larger than 100 au .    in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mum2 - 100 ] we plot @xmath16 in the @xmath24 = 500 au - sphere .",
    "below which keplerian disc formation is suppressed .",
    "the arrow indicates the time when a disc with significant rotational support is observed for the first time .",
    "bottom : inclination of the disc angular momentum to the mean magnetic field for the same spheres as in the top panel.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]   below which keplerian disc formation is suppressed .",
    "the arrow indicates the time when a disc with significant rotational support is observed for the first time .",
    "bottom : inclination of the disc angular momentum to the mean magnetic field for the same spheres as in the top panel.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    it can be seen that @xmath16 increases over time reaching values @xmath27 for the 100 m@xmath0 runs .",
    "this indicates that there is a loss of magnetic flux in the vicinity of the discs over time by a factor of a few .",
    "however , we emphasise that a part of the increase of @xmath16 is most likely due to accretion along the magnetic field lines  a fact which can not be covered by a simple geometrical calculation of the mass - to - flux ratio and which is often ignored in literature .",
    "hence , it is likely that the influence of flux loss e.g. by magnetic reconnection  @xcite on the increase of @xmath16 and thus the formation of keplerian discs is somewhat overestimated .    despite the steady increase of @xmath16",
    "the observed flux loss is still too small to explain the build - up of keplerian discs on its own .",
    "for the 100 m@xmath0 runs @xmath16 exceeds 10 only after 10 kyr , i.e. well _ after _ the keplerian disc has built up , and for the 2.6 m@xmath0 runs it stays below 10 for the entire 15 kyr . since non - turbulent simulations , however , suggest that a value of @xmath28 is necessary for keplerian discs to form , clearly the loss of magnetic flux alone can not explain the observed build - up of keplerian discs at t @xmath25 5 kyr .",
    "we note that for the remaining runs not considered here the time evolution of @xmath16 is qualitatively and quantitatively very similar to the runs 2.6-norot - m100 and 2.6-rot - m100 , i.e. @xmath16 reaches values @xmath29 10 at the end of the simulation ( see table  [ tab : prop ] ) .",
    "recently , @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite suggested that an inclination of the magnetic field with respect to the rotation axis of the core decreases the magnetic braking efficiency . in order to test this statement , we inspected the magnetic field structure in the vicinity of our discs . for this purpose , in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mum2 - 100 ] we plot the inclination @xmath30 of the disc angular momentum to the average magnetic field in the sphere of @xmath24 = 500 au .",
    "the inclination @xmath30 is found to be relatively large except for run 2.6-rot - m2 .",
    "we note that also for the remaining runs there is in general a significant inclination between the disc angular momentum and the mean magnetic field .",
    "interestingly , @xmath30 seems to be somewhat smaller for the runs with overall rotation .",
    "this can be easily understood given the fact that for these runs the disc angular momentum at later times is much closer to the @xmath7-axis ( see left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : theta ] ) and thus also closer to the overall direction of the magnetic field in the core .    at first sight ,",
    "the relatively large inclination between the angular momentum of the disc and the mean magnetic field support the findings of @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite showing that inclined magnetic field lines aid the formation of keplerian discs even for high magnetic field strengths . to investigate those arguments in more detail , we inspect the structure of the magnetic field lines in the vicinity of the disc in run 2.6-rot - m100 in fig .  [ fig : edgeon ] .",
    ".,width=226 ]    although a preferred direction of the magnetic field is recognisable , there is a significant distortion of the magnetic field due to the turbulence on scales of a few 100 au .",
    "for such a distorted magnetic field , however , the definition of a mean field direction , as used by @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite , and its inclination to the disc orientation can be considered questionable .",
    "hence , we strongly suggest that the large inclination between the disc orientation and the mean magnetic field measured in the bottom panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : mum2 - 100 ] is most likely not the only reason for the build - up of keplerian discs .",
    "the distortion of the magnetic field in the surroundings of the discs itself can explain the reduced magnetic braking efficiency and the subsequent build - up of keplerian discs since the disordered field structure prevents an effective coupling of the inner parts close to the disc to the outer parts .",
    "a magnetic field line structure , however , which fans out from a typical disc radius @xmath31 to a radius @xmath9 somewhere outside , would significantly increases the magnetic braking efficiency by a factor of @xmath32  @xcite . for a non - turbulent simulation",
    "usually such a configuration is present , see e.g. fig . 13 in  @xcite or fig . 9 in  @xcite . in our simulations , however , only a strongly disordered field structure is present due to the turbulent motions .",
    "this is what we consider to be the main reason for the reduced magnetic braking efficiency .",
    "we emphasise , however , that more generally one could regard the reduced magnetic braking efficiency due to misaligned magnetic fields  @xcite as being closely related to our case when interpreting the misalignment as some kind of disorder .",
    "moreover , the magnetic braking mechanism as described by  @xcite relies on the build - up of a toroidal magnetic field due to coherent rotational motions . in the vicinity of the discs presented here such coherent rotation structures are barely present .",
    "instead , mass accretion occurs along distinct channels ( shear flows ) created locally by the turbulent motions ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : diskm2 ]  [ fig : diskm1000 ] ) . since we have shown in  @xcite that a significant fraction of the angular momentum is removed by magnetic braking already before the gas falls onto the disc , the lack of a coherent rotation structure in the surroundings of the discs further reduces the magnetic braking efficiency .",
    "simultaneously , the shear flows can provide enough angular momentum to build up the discs as already pointed out in  @xcite .",
    "for the analysis of the time evolution of the discs we restrict ourselves to the runs 2.6-norot - m2 , 2.6-rot - m2 , 2.6-norot - m100 and 2.6-rot - m100 .",
    "there are some interesting differences between low - mass and high - mass cores as well as rotating and non - rotating cores , which will be demonstrated in the following .",
    "we remind the reader that we define the discs by all the gas with a density larger than @xmath21 g @xmath22 around the corresponding sink particle .",
    "first , we consider the time evolution of the orientation of the discs in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : theta ] . for this purpose",
    "we calculate the angular momentum of the discs and show its deviation from the @xmath7-axis , i.e. the polar angle @xmath33 .",
    "we have chosen the @xmath7-axis as it corresponds to the direction of the initial magnetic field .         as can be seen",
    "there is a significant difference between the runs with an overall core rotation compared to that without any rotation as well as between the low- and high - mass runs . in the beginning",
    "the four discs have an angular momentum well off from the @xmath7-axis .",
    "however , for the runs 2.6-rot - m2 and 2.6-rot - m100 the orientation of the disc angular momentum approaches the @xmath7-axis ( @xmath34 ) after some time , for run 2.6-rot - m2 significantly earlier than for run 2.6-rot - m100 .",
    "moreover , one can see that this change in the direction of the angular momentum happens rather quickly  within about 1000 yr .",
    "after the disc orientation has approached the @xmath7-axis it stay more or less constant , which is particularly interesting for run 2.6-rot - m100 since here strongly supersonic turbulent motions are present .",
    "such an alignment of the rotation and magnetic field direction was first observed by  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , for run 2.6-norot - m2 , where no overall rotation but only turbulent motions are present , the disc orientation remains remarkable constant and also the azimuthal angle @xmath35 does not change significantly over time .",
    "we note that we decided not to show the azimuthal angle in fig .",
    "[ fig : theta ] since for the cases where @xmath33 is close to zero the variation in @xmath35 can be very large  although the disc orientation itself does hardly change in this case  which would make the figure basically unreadable .",
    "in contrast to run 2.6-norot - m2 , run 2.6-norot - m100 shows large variations in the disc orientation , which we attribute to the very turbulent environment they form in .",
    "again the changes in the disc s orientation occur rapidly within about 1000 yr or even less .",
    "this points to very distinct accretion events of blobs of gas onto the disc , which results in an almost instantaneous change of the angular momentum .    in run 2.6-rot - m100",
    "the mass of the disc is a factor of a few larger than that of the disc in run 2.6-norot - m100 .",
    "this could be attributed to the closer orientation of the disc in run 2.6-rot - m100 to the @xmath7-axis thus profiting from the large reservoir of angular momentum due to the overall rotation . for the runs with 2.6 m@xmath0 ,",
    "however , both discs have rather similar masses of about 0.05 m@xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , these discs do not grow over time but keep their mass whereas the discs in the high - mass core runs show a clear increase of mass over time despite distinct events of significant mass loss . moreover , a close comparison between the disc orientation and mass for run 2.6-norot - m100 shows that the rapid change of the disc s orientation after 4 kyr and 6 kyr is correlated to a strong increase of the disc mass .",
    "this confirms our assumption of distinct accretion events onto the disc being responsible for the rapid changes .",
    "we note that at the end of each simulation the disc masses are well below the total sink particle masses in the discs , which range from 0.25 m@xmath0 in run 2.6-rot - m2 to 6.3 m@xmath0 in run 2.6-norot - m100 ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : theta ] ) .",
    "we find that phases of significant decrease in disc mass ( see middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : theta ] ) are usually accompanied with increased sink accretion rates .",
    "this can be explained by the preceding accretion of gas onto the disc with a small or even negative angular momentum ( with respect to the disc angular momentum ) .",
    "hence , the specific angular momentum of the disc is lowered and so is the rotational support , which in turn results in a subsequent increase of the sink accretion rate until a rotationally supported equilibrium in the disc is established again .",
    "we emphasise that the discs in the runs not discussed above show qualitatively very similar properties with typical masses of a few 0.1 m@xmath0 and partly strong fluctuations ( see table  [ tab : prop ] ) and a disc angular momentum well off from the @xmath7-axis ( and thus from the overall magnetic field ) . however , as for the runs 2.6-rot - m2 and 2.6-rot - m100 in all other runs with an overall core rotation the orientation of the disc approaches the @xmath7-axis over time as seen already before .",
    "the only exemption is run 2.6-rot - m100-c , where the disc stays misaligned over the entire 15 kyr .    to summarise",
    ", we find that there are some differences in the time evolution of the discs between the runs with and without core rotation as well as between high- and low - mass cores .",
    "nevertheless , as demonstrated in section  [ sec : discs ] , the velocity structure of the individual discs is barely affected .",
    "recently , it was suggested that a large fraction of low - mass protostar and brown dwarfs form via gravitational fragmentation of protostellar discs  ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "in contrast ,  @xcite and  @xcite find that the degree of disc fragmentation is reduced when including radiative feedback .",
    "in these simulations low - mass stars mainly form via the collapse of distinct gravitational cores or condensations  ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the multiple sink particle systems in the discs in our high - mass core runs support the classical disc fragmentation picture  @xcite .",
    "however , a second mechanism to form such a system is the so - called disc - assisted capture  ( see e.g. section 5.4 in * ? ? ? * and references therein ) where the cross section for capturing a bypassing protostar is increased significantly due to the presence of an extended disc . in the following we examine the exact mechanism how the multiple protostellar systems are formed in our simulations .    in fig.[fig :",

    "hence , these sink particles do _ not _ form by fragmentation of the already existing disc but clearly outside it during the collapse of distinct , gravitational unstable regions . only during their further evolution",
    "do the secondarily formed sinks approach the first sink particle and are then captured in the disc . from fig .",
    "[ fig : dist ] it can also be seen that two of the sinks get ejected from the disc due to close three - particle interactions and move away relatively quickly .",
    "these ejected sinks usually do not build up an associated disc around them as already pointed out in section  [ sec : discs ] .    at first sight",
    "it seems interesting that the sink particles in run 2.6-rot - m100 do not form via disc fragmentation but rather due to the fragmentation of the entire core . for this reason we consider the toomre parameter  @xcite describing the stability of the disc : @xmath40 with the epicyclic frequency @xmath41 , sound speed c@xmath42 , surface density @xmath43 , and gravitational constant @xmath18 . gravitational instability sets in when @xmath44 .",
    "as magnetic fields are present in the discs , a magnetic toomre parameter  @xcite @xmath45 can be defined as well , where @xmath46 is the alfvnic velocity taking into account all components of the magnetic field . since we know from section  [ sec : discs ] that the discs have almost keplerian rotation velocities",
    ", we can easily replace the epicyclic frequency @xmath41 in the above equations by the rotation frequency of the gas . in fig .",

    "= 35 au and t = 15 kyr does @xmath47 drop below 1 .",
    "however , since @xmath48 remains clearly above 1 and since no disc fragmentation is recognisable at that stage in the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : diskm100 ] , this indicates that the magnetic field has a stabilising effect on the disc  ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we note that also for other times the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : toomre ] remain qualitatively unchanged .",
    "this supports our conclusion that the sink particles are formed outside the discs by core fragmentation as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dist ] .",
    "we emphasise that also for the runs 2.6-norot - m100 , 2.6-rot - m100-c , 2.6-rot - m100-p2 , 2.6-norot - m300 and 2.6-rot - m1000 , where more that one sink particle forms , fragmentation is not a consequence of a toomre instability in the disc but due to the collapse of distinct gravitationally unstable regions . hence , in these runs the occurrence of multiple protostellar systems is due to the capturing of bypassing protostars and not due to disc fragmentation . the only exemption is run 2.6-rot - m100-b where in total 36 sink particles form . in this run",
    "after roughly 11 kyr disc fragmentation occurs around the most massive sink particle at a radius of about 25 au . in this case",
    "both the classical and the magnetic toomre parameter clearly drop below 1 shortly before the fragment forms as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : toomre ] ( green lines ) .",
    "in section  [ sec : discs ] we have shown that the first disc - like structures with noticeable rotational support build up around 5 kyr and are already well developed around 7.5 kyr ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : diskm2 ]   [ fig : velm300 - 1000 ] ) .",
    "since the mass - to - flux ratio @xmath16 , however , stays well below the critical value of 10 found in non - turbulent simulations over at least the first 10 kyr , no rotationally supported discs should be expected to form .",
    "thus , the build - up of keplerian discs from the very beginning on has to be attributed rather to the disordered magnetic field structure and the lack of a coherent rotation structure in the surroundings of the discs .",
    "the required amount of angular momentum is mainly carried by shear flows produced by the turbulent motions .",
    "recently ,  @xcite reported a significant misalignment of outflows and magnetic fields in low - mass star forming regions .",
    "the misalignment was measured on scales of @xmath1 1000 au , thus on the same scale considered in fig .",
    "[ fig : mum2 - 100 ] in this work . as discussed in section  [ sec : massflux ] , our simulations suggest that the observed misalignment could also be a consequence of an unresolved disordered magnetic field structure .",
    "moreover , since misaligned magnetic fields are simply a particular form of a disordered field structure , we suggest that the formation of keplerian discs in the misaligned case  @xcite and in our work can be traced back to the same physical origin",
    ".    we note , however , that very recently  @xcite tried to confirm the results found by the authors mentioned before with a different numerical scheme .",
    "one striking result of their study is that misalignment does _ not _ allow for keplerian disc formation for @xmath49 , i.e. for typical observed values .",
    "moreover , based on the work of  @xcite and  @xcite ,  @xcite estimated the expected fraction of keplerian discs to be as low as 10  50 % . in the presence of turbulence",
    ", however , we showed that in essentially any case  even for @xmath49  keplerian discs can form .",
    "recently , @xcite suggested that the loss of magnetic flux due to turbulent reconnection is responsible for the reduced magnetic braking efficiency .",
    "magnetic flux loss alone , however , does not necessarily change the _ classical picture _ of magnetic braking , i.e. a well - ordered magnetic field and coherent rotating as studied in numerous simulations neglecting turbulence .",
    "hence , in this case the value of @xmath16 would be an appropriate quantity to assess the magnetic braking efficiency .",
    "however , in our simulations @xmath16 stays well below the critical value of @xmath1 10 during the formation phase of the keplerian discs ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mum2 - 100 ] ) indicating that flux loss alone can not account for the observed build - up of keplerian discs .",
    "thus , other mechanisms like the aforementioned disordered magnetic fields and turbulent motions in the close vicinity of the discs  which are natural outcomes when using realistic initial conditions for star formation  have to account for this .    in a second paper @xcite",
    "argue that , when considering scales of the size of the disc ( @xmath1 100 au ) , @xmath16 will increase , a fact we also observe in our simulations . as mentioned in section  [ sec : massflux ] , the increase of @xmath16 could partly be due to accretion along the field lines .",
    "moreover , we consider it as crucial to reduce the magnetic braking efficiency already on larger scales ( by means of disordered magnetic fields but not weaker field strengths as indicated by the low value of @xmath16 ) since otherwise there would be no angular momentum left on the small scales ( 100 au ) to form the discs .",
    "this idea is also supported by the findings that for a well - ordered magnetic field the inwards transport of angular momentum is balanced by the ( negative ) magnetic torque at scales up to 500  1000 au  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we suggest that the magnetic flux loss occurring subsequently in the evolution of the discs helps to maintain them in a rotationally supported state , in particular in the later phase ( t @xmath50 10 kyr ) .",
    "finally , we note that we did not cover the parameter space in a uniform way .",
    "since we have a ( at least ) 5-dimensional parameter space spanning the strength of turbulence , magnetic fields and rotation as well as the core mass and the density profile , even a limited coverage of the parameter space would result in a considerable amount of different initial conditions . in combination with the very high resolution of 1.2 au this leads to significant requirements of computational resources making a uniform coverage of the parameter space impossible .",
    "nevertheless , even with the simulations presented here it becomes clear that turbulence - induced disc formation works for a wide range of molecular core masses and for different turbulence strengths .",
    "furthermore , we showed that the formation of discs does not depend on the presence of an overall core rotation although the orientation of the discs does .",
    "the degree of fragmentation in most of the runs with 100 m@xmath0 is relatively low ( @xmath1 5 sinks ) given a highly gravitationally unstable core with supersonic turbulence .",
    "however ,  @xcite have shown that the fragmentation properties of a molecular cloud core with a density profile @xmath51 as chosen in this work strongly depend on the realisation of the initial turbulence field .",
    "indeed , in run 2.6-rot - m100-b the core fragments much more heavily forming 36 sink particle in the first 15 kyr .",
    "the formation of keplerian discs , however , is not affected by the different fragmentation behaviour .    however , since we do not include radiative feedback from the protostars in our simulations , in particular in the heavily fragmenting runs 2.6-rot - m100-b , 2.6-norot - m300 and 2.6-rot - m1000 we might significantly overestimate the number of fragments  @xcite . for the runs 2.6-norot - m100 , 2.6-rot - m100 , 2.6-rot - m100-c and 2.6-rot - m100-p2 , however , we find a similar number of fragments as in comparable simulations of  @xcite ( 5  10 sinks ) , despite the fact that we did not include radiative feedback .",
    "this is most likely a consequence of the presence of strong magnetic fields .",
    "this was already stated by  @xcite , who find that magnetic fields seem to suppress fragmentation in the diffuse core regions whereas radiative feedback mainly acts in the dense disc region .",
    "however , also in our simulations without radiative feedback we find that disc fragmentation is not the main fragmentation mechanism in our simulations . in all",
    "runs the sink particles are formed via the gravitational collapse of distinct overdense condensations  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also  @xcite for an overview ) , only in run 2.6-rot - m100-b a few sinks are formed via disc fragmentation .",
    "comparing @xmath47 and @xmath48 shows that the magnetic field can strongly contribute to the stability of the discs ( fig .",
    "[ fig : toomre ] ) .",
    "we note that whereas in related work the reduced degree of fragmentation was often simply due to the suppression of keplerian discs formation  @xcite , here it is indeed a consequence of rising the toomre parameter above the critical value for stability .",
    "hence , our result is complementary to the work of  @xcite , @xcite and  @xcite , who show that also radiative feedback suppresses the fragmentation of protostellar discs .",
    "for the accretion discs around high - mass stars , however ,  @xcite have shown that ionization feedback and radiative heating is insufficient to strongly suppress fragmentation , at least outside of radii of @xmath52au .",
    "therefore it seems that the question of the importance of radiative feedback is not yet fully resolved .",
    "the capture and inwards migration of secondarily formed sinks in the high - mass cases presents a path to form tight binaries ( separation @xmath1 1 au ) .",
    "however , in run 2.6-norot - m100 and 2.6-rot - m100 the binary forms after roughly 5 kyr ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dist ] ) with the lower - mass sink having a mass of @xmath1 0.1 m@xmath0 .",
    "hence , by that time an extended first core might still exist  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which might have merged with the more massive sink to form a single protostar .",
    "we note that a more detailed study on the process of binary formation will be postponed to a subsequent study .",
    "the initial conditions of run 2.6-norot - m300 were motivated by the recent work of  @xcite . in their work",
    "the authors study the collapse of a molecular cloud core with similar properties under the additional influence of radiative feedback . using a spatial resolution of 1.25 au",
    "these authors find a 40 au - sized keplerian disc .",
    "with our run 2.6-norot - m300 , which has a spatial resolution similar to that of  @xcite , we can confirm this result finding even two keplerian discs .",
    "the first disc in run 2.6-norot - m300 shows heavy fragmentation and temporarily gets completely disrupted but quickly re - establishes its keplerian structure after each disruption event .",
    "furthermore , we note that  @xcite do not find a keplerian disc when they reduce the spatial resolution by a factor of 8 .",
    "we performed a resolution study for run 2.6-rot - m100 with a four times and eight times coarser resolution , i.e. d@xmath53 = 4.7 and 9.4 au , respectively .",
    "we find that with decreasing resolution the discs become smaller and progressively sub - keplerian .",
    "although there is still an indication of a rotationally supported structure in the run with a 8 times coarser resolution , the results of our resolution study strongly suggest that a spatial resolution of _ at least _ a few au  depending on the actual numerical method used  is needed to properly simulate the formation of keplerian discs in a strongly magnetised environment .",
    "recently , the emergence of magnetic bubbles expanding radially outwards _ in the plane _ of the disc have been observed in non - turbulent simulations  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this feature , which occurs after a relatively short time ( t @xmath54 10 kyr ) , is a consequence of the ongoing mass accretion and  due to the conditions of ideal mhd  a corresponding magnetic flux accumulation . once the magnetic pressure in the centre is strong enough to overcome the gravitationally drag , a low - density , highly magnetised bubble forms thus reducing the flux in the centre of the disc .",
    "clearly , this bubble - like feature does not show up in our runs including turbulence .",
    "since the accretion rates of the sink particles of 10@xmath55 m@xmath0 yr@xmath26 and a few 10@xmath56 m@xmath0 yr@xmath26 for the low - mass and high - mass runs , however , are comparable to the non - turbulent runs , one could naively expect the same amount of magnetic flux to accumulate in the disc centre eventually resulting in the appearance of a magnetic bubble .",
    "since this is not the case , the magnetic field has to diffuse outwards before it is accreted onto the sink .",
    "this could be achieved by processes like magnetic reconnection and/or numerical diffusion in the already existing , rotationally supported disc .",
    "this agrees with the fact that @xmath16 increases in time ( see top panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : mum2 - 100 ] ) and for smaller radii  ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a reason for an increased numerical diffusion of magnetic fields could be the lower infall velocities associated with keplerian discs , which in turn give magnetic diffusion more time to operate .",
    "we note that the occurrence of numerical diffusion can also be motivated physically since in this regime non - ideal mhd effects like ohmic dissipation or ambipolar diffusion are expected to come into play  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as pointed out in section  [ sec : time ] , the masses of the discs range from about 0.05 m@xmath0 up to a few 0.1 m@xmath0 and thus are a factor of about 10 below the sink particle masses . a simple density threshold criterion was used to define the disc .",
    "we note that recently  @xcite suggested a more sophisticated criterion including also the velocity structure to determine the gas belonging to the disc .",
    "however , since both criteria can only give an approximate mass for the disc , we decided to stay with our simple criterion . for a more sophisticated comparison with observational data anyway",
    "synthetic observations produced with a radiation transfer code would we required .",
    "nevertheless , the disc masses in our runs agree reasonably well with a number of observations ranging from low - mass  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to high - mass protostellar objects  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , in particular for the latter case discs with significantly higher masses up to a few m@xmath0 are observed , although these discs might correspond to structures without significant rotational support  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , keplerian rotation in a class 0 protostellar disc has been observed up to a radius of 90 au  @xcite in accordance with our findings .",
    "in contrast ,  @xcite do not find keplerian discs around class 0 objects .",
    "hence , to unambiguously answer the question at which stage keplerian discs form , high - resolution observations e.g. with alma are required .",
    "our work clearly shows that under realistic conditions , i.e. when including turbulent motions , early - type , rotationally supported protostellar discs can form in typical star forming regions .",
    "this study was aimed at testing the turbulence - induced disc formation mechanism reported in  @xcite for a wider range of initial conditions .",
    "we performed several simulations of collapsing molecular cloud cores with a wide range of masses ( 2.6  1000 m@xmath0 ) as well as different turbulence strengths ranging from sub- to supersonic .",
    "we showed that independently of the cores mass , the strength of turbulence , or the presence of global rotation in all cases keplerian discs build up after a few kyr already .",
    "the discs typically have a diameter of 50  150 au and masses of 0.05 up to a few 0.1 m@xmath0 .",
    "interestingly , fragmentation mostly occurs in distinct overdense regions of the core rather than in the discs due to the toomre instability .",
    "we showed that magnetic fields significantly contribute to the stability of the discs .",
    "tight binaries can still form by disc capturing and inwards migration of secondarily formed protostars .    from the work on disc formation under the influence of magnetic fields done",
    "so far a common picture seems to arise : due to the turbulent nature of star forming regions the classical picture of a well - ordered magnetic field structure and coherent rotational motions , used by  @xcite to assess the efficiency of magnetic braking , seems to break down . under realistic conditions a disordered and/or misaligned magnetic field structure  ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as turbulent shear flows emerge , which cause the classical magnetic braking efficiency to drop and allow for the formation of keplerian discs in essentially all cases considered here .",
    "the likelihood of disc formation in the turbulent case is therefore higher than that for purely misaligned fields in non - turbulent cores  @xcite . during the formation of the discs the mass - to - flux ratio stays well below the critical value of 10 ,",
    "hence magnetic flux - loss alone can not explain the formation of keplerian discs .",
    "however , the subsequent increase of @xmath16 due to magnetic flux loss and mass accretion along magnetic field lines certainly helps to maintain a rotationally supported state during the further evolution of the discs .",
