    "we wish to extract any collider implications , as well as implications for the dark matter annihilation mechanism .",
    "the mssm contains several good candidates for cold dark matter , the most studied being the lightest neutralino @xmath19 .",
    "the assumption that thermally produced neutralinos make up the dominant component of dark matter leads to strict constraints upon the parameter space of the mssm .",
    "we shall here take this assumption , as well as the assumption of r - parity ( which provides stability for the lightest neutralinos ) . in order to keep the dimensionality of the parameter space down , we shall further specialise to the cmssm .",
    "the cmssm unifies all susy breaking scalar mass parameters to @xmath20 , the standard model gaugino mass parameters to @xmath21 and the susy breaking trilinear scalar couplings to @xmath22 at a high energy scale , commonly taken to be the scale of electroweak gauge unification @xmath23 .",
    "our choice of parameters from which to calculate the fine - tuning includes the susy breaking higgs bilinear @xmath24 : @xmath25 @xmath24 is used in preference to @xmath26 since it directly appears in the lagrangian and is therefore considered to be more fundamental .",
    "our definition of @xmath18 does not include the sensitivity to the gut - scale top yukawa coupling @xmath27 .",
    "we can argue about whether to include it or not in the definition since its value is determined by aspects of flavour physics in the model , an orthogonal aspect to the susy breaking aspects studied in the present paper .",
    "were we to include it in the definition of @xmath18 , a strong suppression of the high @xmath20 regime would be the likely result of the naturalness prior , since @xmath28 is very high there  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , exclusion limits from lep1 and lep2 were placed upon the cmssm and a probability of @xmath29 was applied to the remaining parameter space .",
    "this resulted in probability distributions for sparticle masses and various observables .",
    "this work is similar in spirit to the ingredient of the naturalness prior that we will follow .",
    "a more common approach in the literature involves applying separate 95@xmath5 c.l .",
    "constraints upon a two - dimensional sub - space of the model , see recent examples in ref .",
    "the advantage of this simple approach is that it is easy to discern which constraints act on different parts of parameter space . on the other hand ,",
    "it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that a more complete approach would perform a combined likelihood fit in the full dimensionality of the parameter space , including variations of important standard model input parameters .",
    "in fact , the feasibility of the approach had already been demonstrated in a four - dimensional subspace  @xcite .",
    "this was achieved by utilising the metropolis algorithm in a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the mcmc approach to parameter sampling has a calculation time that scales linearly with the number of dimensions , rendering it very useful for investigating parameter spaces with dimensionality greater than 3 .",
    "we point the interested reader to refs .",
    "@xcite for details on the algorithm , but the important point for the present paper is that the algorithm provides a list ( or `` chain '' ) of points in parameter space . the density of points that it produces is proportional to some specified function of the parameters . in reference",
    "@xcite , the function chosen was the likelihood , the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of reproducing data @xmath30 given a point in cmssm parameter space @xmath31 : @xmath32 .",
    "one ideally wishes to determine the posterior pdf that the model point @xmath31 is correct given the data @xmath30 : @xmath33 .",
    "the relative posterior between two different points @xmath34 in parameter space can be determined provided one assumes a prior pdf for the model parameters @xmath35 : @xmath36 thus , the likelihood distribution is proportional to the posterior distribution for the case of flat prior distributions , i.e. when @xmath37 is a constant across the relevant parameter space . for a brief discussion on a bayesian interpretation of the prior probability distributions , see the appendix .    here",
    ", we will go beyond the mcmc analysis of ref.@xcite by using a plausible _ naturalness_-favouring prior proportional to @xmath29 .",
    "this will then disfavour regions of parameter space with high fine - tuning , arguably a commendable effect .",
    "we will then compare and contrast the resulting probability distributions of observables , parameters and sparticle masses with the flat - prior case .",
    "having obtained a chain of points whose density is proportional to their posterior assuming some prior , we could in principle",
    "just re - weight the probability of each point by some new prior and re - plot all of the results . in the present case , we would for example use the flat - prior sample , but reweight the probability of each point by @xmath29 , then re - bin any results . the only disadvantage to this approach is that if previously unlikely regions of parameter space now have high probabilities , they will not have been sampled very often in the initial markov chain run .",
    "thus the statistical fluctuations in this region will be large .",
    "if the prior does nt make a lot of difference to the posterior , this degradation of the statistics may not matter much . here",
    "though , we will find a significant difference in the results due to different priors , implying that a simple re - weighting procedure would suffer from poor statistics .",
    "we have actually re - run the mcmc with the new prior , which circumvents any potential statistics problem .",
    "the numerical analysis follows ref .",

    "although this range was initially considered on perturbativity and naturalness grounds , there is a further pragmatic region for not extending it , namely that an enlarged space will result in less efficiency in the mcmc algorithm .",

    "a convergence test was applied . as described in ref .",

    ". an estimation of the convergence of the individual chains can be determined by comparing how similar the distributions of interesting quantities are between the different chains . the technique ( invented in ref .",
    "@xcite ) as implemented in ref .",
    "@xcite , provides an estimated upper bound on the potential root variance reduction of each scalar quantity if the chain were run for an infinite number of steps .",
    "after 10@xmath57 steps , the upper bound is less than the required 5@xmath5 for the naturalness prior sample and for the flat prior sample , for every scalar distribution that we are interested in .",
    "the chains were therefore deemed to have converged .",
    "for all of the numerical results presented below , the full 9@xmath5810@xmath57 potential - point sample was used .",

    "marginalisation simply means that the unseen dimensions are integrated over .",
    "individual mcmc points were placed in 75 by 75 bins in the 2 dimensional space , and for each plot the probabilities are normalised by the probability in the highest bin .",
    "thus , one can consider the marginalisation process to be an averaging of the posterior in the unseen dimensions .",

    ".    the amount of skew of the probability distributions will be modified by changing the prior assumption .",
    "for example , choosing a prior that is proportional to @xmath84 instead of @xmath29 ( thus effectively counting the naturalness twice rather than just once ) would produce more skew in the distributions .",
    "there are many possible future directions for the use of mcmc algorithms in fits to supersymmetric models .",
    "one obvious direction is the possibility of considering different supersymmetry breaking models , for example relaxing some of the universality assumed in the cmssm .",
    "another possible direction would be to include electroweak observables in the fit .",
    "yet another would be to explore the @xmath85 part of parameter space and work out its probability normalisation with respect to the @xmath86 part .",
    "the mcmc procedure carried out here was at the limit of cpu capabilities available to the author , but finding a more efficient algorithm could allow for an enlargement of the parameter space considered .",
    "in particular , going to high values of @xmath20 would be useful in order to fully investigate the focus point regime  @xcite .",
    "we would like to thank g g ross for providing the idea and motivation for this project , to cern for hosting the computer facilities used and to m drees for an argument about the priors .",
    "this work has been partially supported by pparc .",
    "we are aware that readers that are unfamiliar with bayesian statistics might feel uncomfortable at the appearance of the admittedly subjective priors ( see for example , a footnote on page 6 of ref .",
    "a bayesian viewpoint is that we are allowing the data to modify our uncertainty in some parameter and that probability is a measurement of our uncertainty .",
    "for example , one might estimate the chances of throwing a 6 on a straight cubic die to be 1 in 6 , but knowledge of the position , the speed and the initial configuration of the die etc .  would allow us to calculate the spin and trajectory of the die and so to modify the probability of throwing a 6 .",
    "solace may be taken from the fact that the more precise data are , the more insensitive the posteriors will be to the priors .",
    "for instance , the data on the electron mass @xmath87 is so precise that different priors proportional to , say , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 will result in almost identical posterior distributions for @xmath87 .",
    "choosing an extreme prior such as a delta - function for @xmath87 at 1 tev , will result in a posterior delta function also at 1 tev and it appears that many feel that this renders the bayesian approach followed in this paper suspect . usually , the sub - text to this argument is the assumption that the prior is some probability distribution set by nature .",
    "however , if we interpret the prior as a measure of _ our _ uncertainty on @xmath87 , setting it to be a delta function is equivalent to stating that we are absolutely sure of its value and we are not going to let data give us any information about it .",

    "<S> the dark matter relic density , the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and the branching ratio of @xmath0 are all used to constrain the model via a markov chain monte carlo sampler . as a result of the naturalness prior , posterior probability distributions skew towards lighter higgs and sparticle masses , the effect being most pronounced in the gaugino sector . </S>",

    "<S> the lightest cp - even higgs @xmath1-pole annihilation mechanism becomes allowed at the 2@xmath2 level for the latest combination of measurements of @xmath3 gev , provided we allow for a theoretical error in the prediction of its mass @xmath4 . </S>",

    "<S> probing the branching ratio of @xmath6 to the level of 2@xmath7 , as might be achieved by the tevatron experiments , would cover 32@xmath5 of the probability density , irrespective of which of the two priors is used . </S>"
