    "the explicit solution corresponding to a general convex set in @xmath22 was described in the papers @xcite ( covering also the case of the union of convex sets which are sufficiently far in a precise sense ) .    when @xmath4 is the union of two convex sets @xmath23 , the situation may become more complicated , even when both sets are calibrable .",
    "in particular , if the sets are near each other , more precisely if the perimeter of its convex hull is smaller than the sum of the perimeters of the two sets , then the sets interact , and the solution outside @xmath4 is not null ( for small values of @xmath24 ) .",

    "we extend the result of allard @xcite to the case where @xmath4 is the union of any two balls in @xmath5 .",
    "the interesting case is when the perimeter of the convex hull of @xmath4 is less than the perimeter of @xmath4 , since otherwise the solution can be described as the sum of the solutions corresponding to each ball @xcite .",
    "our approach differs from the one in @xcite even for the case of two balls of the same radius .",
    "while the solution in @xcite is obtained by a explicit computation , we describe it in a shorter way by means of more general geometric arguments .",

    ", we prove that the intersection of @xmath40 , with the minimizing sets is either @xmath41 or @xmath42 .",
    "we also give a counterexample showing that this result is not true for any value of @xmath24 .",

    "the computation of explicit examples of tv denoising permits to exhibit qualitative features of the solution .",
    "in particular , the appearance of new level lines is a undesirable feature for denoising .",
    "better denoising algorithms have been developed in the last few years @xcite .",

    ": preliminaries ] we review some known results that permit to set the context of our analysis .    in section [ sect : solutionballs ] we describe the generic properties of the minimizers @xmath48 of and we prove that , if @xmath4 is the union of two balls and @xmath43 , then the intersection of @xmath48 with @xmath41 , @xmath49 , is either @xmath41 or the empty set .",
