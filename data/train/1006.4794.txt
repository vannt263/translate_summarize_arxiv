    "let us consider @xmath0 time series @xmath1 ; after a linear transformation , we may assume all the time series to be normalized and with zero mean .",
    "the lagged times series are denoted @xmath2 .",
    "we make the hypothesis that the dynamics of the system under consideration may be described in terms of a few modes , and that these modes may be extracted by principal components analysis , as follows . calling @xmath3 the @xmath4 matrix with elements",
    "@xmath5 , we denote @xmath6 the ( normalized ) eigenvectors of the matrix @xmath7 corresponding to the largest @xmath8 eigenvalues .",
    "the t - dimensional vectors @xmath9 summarize the dynamics of the system ; the lagged correlations of the system determine to what extent the modes @xmath10 may be predicted on the basis of the @xmath11 variables .",
    "preliminarily , we select the variables which are significatively correlated with the modes @xmath10 . for each @xmath12 and each @xmath13",
    "we evaluate the probability @xmath14 that the correlation between @xmath15 and @xmath16 is due to chance , obtained by student s t test .",
    "we compare @xmath14 with the @xmath17 confidence level after bonferroni correction ( the threshold is @xmath18 ) and retain only those variables @xmath15 which are significatively correlated with at least one mode .",
    "the variables thus selected will be denoted @xmath19 , @xmath20 being their cardinality .",
    "the second step of the present approach is the introduction of a bivariate measure of redundancy , as follows .",
    "for each pair of variables @xmath21 and @xmath22 , we denote @xmath23 the projector onto the one - dimensional space spanned by @xmath21 and @xmath24 the projector onto the space corresponding to @xmath22 ; @xmath25 is the projector onto the bi - dimensional space spanned by @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "then , we define : @xmath26 according to the discussion in @xcite , @xmath27 is positive ( negative ) if variables @xmath21 and @xmath22 are redundant ( synergetic ) w.r.t . the prediction of the future of the system . in other words ,",
    "if @xmath21 and @xmath22 share the same information about @xmath10 , then @xmath27 is positive .    in the third step ,",
    "the matrix @xmath27 is used to construct a weighted graph of @xmath20 nodes , the weight of each link measuring the degree of redundancy between the two variables connected by that link . by maximization of the modularity @xcite",
    ", the number of modules , as well as their content , is extracted from the weighted graph .",
    "each module is recognized as a group of variables sharing the same information about the future of the system .    as an example we report the following example .",
    "let us consider the following autoregressive system : @xmath28 where @xmath29 are i.i.d .",
    "unit variance gaussian variables . by construction",
    ", @xmath30 is caused by @xmath31 and viceversa .",
    "a system of @xmath32 time series is constructed as follows . for @xmath33 : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath29 are i.i.d .",
    "unit variance gaussian variables . starting from a random initial configuration ,",
    "the above equations are iterated and , after discarding the initial transient regime , @xmath36 consecutive samples of the system are stored for further analysis .",
    "note that the first ten variables share the same information corresponding to @xmath30 , whilst the second ten variables share the information of @xmath31 .",
    "the variables @xmath37 , with @xmath38 , form a group of variables with correlations at equal times , similarly to the group of variables with @xmath39 .",
    "the variables @xmath37 , with @xmath40 , correspond to pure noise . in figure ( [ fig1 ] )",
    "the equal - times correlations of the system are depicted , for a typical case with @xmath41 , showing four groups of correlated variables .",
    "we perform the principal components analysis and retain a variable number @xmath8 of modes for the analysis .    in figure ( [ fig2 ] ) , top - left , we depict @xmath20 , the number of selected variables , as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "for @xmath42 , twenty variables ( @xmath37 with @xmath43 ) are selected ; nineteen variables for @xmath44 .",
    "then , for each value of @xmath8 , the quantities @xmath27 are evaluated .",
    "we find that , in this example , the matrix @xmath27 is non - negative and can be treated as a weighted graph .    in figure ( [ fig2 ] ) ,",
    "top - right , we plot the number of modules @xmath45 we find by applying the method described in @xcite to the matrix @xmath27 ; the method correctly recognizes the two modules for each value of @xmath8 .    in figure ( [ fig2 ] ) ,",
    "bottom - left , we plot a measure of the stability of the partition while going from @xmath46 to @xmath8 , defined as follows .",
    "we consider all the pairs of variables that are selected both in correspondence of @xmath46 and @xmath8 .",
    "the stability is one minus the fraction of pairs such that the variables are recognized to be in the same module in one instance and in different modules in the other instance . in this case",
    "the stability is always one ; when the method is applied to real data , the stability curve may be helpful to fix the optimal number of modes @xmath8 .    finally , in figure ( [ fig2 ] ) , bottom - right , the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath47 are depicted .",
    "in this case it is clear that the optimal number of modes is four .",
    "we remark that a suitable number of samples is needed to obtain reliable results . in figure ( [ fig3 ] )",
    "we depict the number of selected variables , for this example , as a function of @xmath36 for three choices of @xmath8 : it vanishes as the number of samples decreases .",
    "the fmri signal can be regarded as a proxy for the underlying neural activity .",
    "remote regions of the brain do not operate in isolation and there is a growing interest in studying the interactions and connectivity patterns between these regions , which have been investigated by independent component analysis @xcite , principal components analysis @xcite and other approaches .",
    "temporal and spatial functional networks , corresponding to spontaneous brain activity in humans , were derived in @xcite on the basis of the equal - time correlation matrix .",
    "modularity in the resting state of the human brain has also been studied in @xcite .",
    "the connectivity structure of brain networks extracted from spontaneous activity signals of healthy subjects and epileptic patients has been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "here we consider fmri data from a subject in resting conditions , with sampling frequency 1 hz , and number of samples equal to 500 .",
    "a prior brain atlas is utilized to parcellate the brain into ninety cortical and subcortical regions , and a single time series is associated to each region . all the ninety time series",
    "are then band - passed in the range 0.01 - 0.08 hz .    in figure ( [ fig4 ] ) , top - left , we depict @xmath20 , the number of selected variables , as a function of @xmath8 . for @xmath48 ,",
    "all the ninety regions are recognized as influencing the future of the system .",
    "for each value of @xmath8 , the quantities @xmath27 are evaluated . in figure ( [ fig4 ] ) , top - right",
    ", the number of modules @xmath45 we find by applying the method described in @xcite to the matrix @xmath27 is depicted ; this plot suggests the presence of four modules for @xmath49 .",
    "these values are the most stable , as it is clear from figure ( [ fig2 ] ) , bottom - left , where we plot the measure of the stability of the partition while going from @xmath46 to @xmath8 .",
    "it follows that the optimal value of @xmath8 is four , corresponding to a graph structure with four modules and modularity equal to 0.3 .",
    "we find that module 1 includes brain regions from ventral medial frontal cortices which are primarily specialized for anterior default mode network , module 2 is typical referred to as posterior default mode network , module 3 mainly corresponds to executive control network and module 4 refers to the subcortical network . in figure ( [ fig4 ] ) , bottom - right ,",
    "the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath47 are depicted .",
    "it is worth comparing the histogram of the values of @xmath27 , in this example ( figure ( [ fig5])-bottom ) , with those corresponding to a random choice of the modes @xmath10 ( figure ( [ fig5])-top ) . in the random case , the pairs of variables are either redundant or synergetic , and the typical values of @xmath50 are very small . on the data set at hand ,",
    "the magnitude of the values of @xmath50 s is much higher and variables are mostly redundant ; indeed the @xmath50 s are negative ( with small absolute value ) only for a few pairs of regions .",
    "we remark that the presence of a few small and negative weights does not influence significantly the output from the modularity algorithm of @xcite : the output does not change if all @xmath50 s with absolute value less than a threshold are set to zero ( the threshold being chosen so that all the elements of the resulting matrix are nonnegative ) .    averaging the time series belonging to each module , we obtain four time series and we evaluate the causalities between them : the result is displayed in figure ( [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to observe that module 4 influences all the three other modules but is not influenced by them , it is an out - degree hub ; this is consistent with the fact that it corresponds to subcortical brain .",
    "another striking feature is the clear interdependencies between modules 2 and 3 .",
    "the reliability of this pattern needs to be assessed on a large population of subjects .",
    "hela @xcite is a famous cell culture , isolated from a human uterine cervical carcinoma in 1951 .",
    "hela cells have somehow acquired cellular immortality , in that the normal mechanisms of programmed cell death after a certain number of divisions have somehow been switched off .",
    "we consider the hela cell gene expression data of @xcite .",
    "data corresponds to @xmath51 genes and @xmath52 time points , with an hour interval separating two successive readings ( the hela cell cycle lasts 16 hours ) .",
    "the 94 genes were selected , from the full data set described in @xcite , on the basis of the association with cell cycle regulation and tumor development .",
    "this data has been also considered in @xcite .",
    "the static correlation analysis between time series , which is the result of regulation mechanisms with time scales faster than the sampling rate , revealed a highly related network with the presence of two modules : the first module was recognized as corresponding to the regulatory network of the transcriptional factor nfkb @xcite , whilst the second module appeared to be orchestrated by transcriptional factors p53 and stat3 .",
    "use of bivariate granger causality , in @xcite , has put in evidence 19 causality relationships acting on the time scale of one hour , all involving genes playing some role in processes related to tumor development .    as stated in @xcite ,",
    "fundamental patterns underlie gene expression profiles .",
    "this suggest the use of the proposed approach on gene expression time series . in figure ( [ fig6 ] )",
    "we describe the application of the proposed approach on the hela data - set .",
    "the stable partition corresponds to @xmath53 and consists of two modules of 9 and 7 genes ( the modularity is 0.1 ) .",
    "the first module is characterized by the transcriptional factor nfkb and consists of nfkb , mcp-1 , icam-1 , bcl - xl , iap , a20 , c - myc , tsp1 , and mcl-1 .",
    "the second module is related to the transcriptional factor junb , known to be a regulator of life and death of cells @xcite , and consists of junb , il-6 , ikappaba , p21 , noxa , c - jun and nrbp . averaging the time series belonging to each module , and evaluating the causality between the two time series thus obtained",
    ", we obtain a relevant ( 0.145 ) causality of the first module on the second one .",
    "we note that all the sixteen genes selected by our approach were recognized as interacting in @xcite ; nine of them were involved also in the causalities described in @xcite .",
    "it is not surprising that different methods , on the same data set , provide slightly different results : currently available data size and data quality make the reconstruction of gene regulatory networks from gene expression data a challenge . in figure ( [ fig5])-bottom )",
    "we depict the histogram of the values of @xmath50 on this data - set , with those corresponding to choosing randomly the modes @xmath10 ( figure ( [ fig5])-top ) . on this data ,",
    "the values of @xmath50 that we obtain are significatively greater than those one finds in the random case , and all the pairs are redundant .",
    "grouping redundant time series reveals their functional roles in complex systems . in the frame of causal approaches ,",
    "grouping redundant time series may reflect directed influence of one group over another . in this work",
    "we have proposed a novel approach which assumes that ( i ) the dynamics of the system can be described using just a small number of characteristic modes , and that ( ii ) a pairwise measure of redundancy is sufficient to elicit the presence of correlated degrees of freedom .",
    "grouping is provided by the identification of the modules of the weighted graph of redundancies .",
    "the method may be seen as an alternative to the analysis of @xcite , which can be applied also for large systems .",
    "we have shown the effectiveness of the proposed approach in two applications , the analysis of fmri data and the analysis of gene expression data . in both",
    "these applications usually linear interactions are sought for , and only lags of 1 are considered , therefore here we limited to consider a linear pairwise measure of redundancy , and considered only lags of 1 .",
    "the generalization of the pairwise redundancy measure , here introduced , to the nonlinear case and to lags of higher order is matter for further work , along the lines described in @xcite .",
