    "the remarkable homogeneity of type ia sne has led to general consensus regarding the nature of the progenitor system .",
    "type ia sne are believed to result from the thermonuclear disruption of a carbon - oxygen white dwarf . in the favored scenario ,",
    "the white dwarf is one component of a close binary , and accretes hydrogen from its companion star .",
    "when the white dwarf reaches the chandrasekhar limit , explosive carbon burning sets in .",
    "burning to nuclear statistical equilibrium ensues , yielding radioactive @xmath2ni .",
    "although the intrinsic peak brightness of type ia sne can vary by up to 2.5 magnitudes in the @xmath3-band , there exists a tight correlation between the peak luminosity and the shape of light curve which can be exploited to derive accurate relative distances .",
    "the peak brightness is determined by the amount of radioactive @xmath2ni produced in the explosion .",
    "this amount spans 0.09  0.93@xmath4 , although most events cluster in the 0.4 - 0.7@xmath4 range @xcite .",
    "the cause of this large variation is not understood .",
    "it is becoming increasingly clear that type ia sne are not a one - parameter family @xcite .",

    "one way of gaining physical insight is to assemble a sample of type ia sne with complete observational coverage from pre - maximum to nebular phases , over as wide a wavelength range as possible .",
    "such data can then be used to confront state - of - the - art explosion and spectral synthesis models . until recently ,",
    "such data have been non - existent . for the very nearby events ( @xmath5 )",

    "the strong and early presence of iron group elements in sn 2003gs suggests that the outer layers of partially burned ejecta have lower opacities in sn  2003gs than they do in normal type ia sne .",
    "this is an important clue to understanding the photometric behavior of sn  2003gs , which indicates a faster than normal decline from approximately normal peak brightness . in sn  2003gs ,",

    "as we have found before , the uncertainties in the near - ir extinction corrections are comparable to the random errors of the photometry , even if a given object is dimmed and reddened by dust with non - standard properties .    in table [ properties ] we give the absolute magnitudes of sn  2003gs for the @xmath13 and @xmath16 bands .",

    "the @xmath31-band data just after maximum light are convincingly fit with the _ unstretched _ template given by @xcite .",
    "the implication is that the @xmath31-band maximum was 0.23 mag brighter than our first ( s - corrected ) value , obtained 2.1 days after t(@xmath0 ) . that the unstretched template fits the data is evidence that in the @xmath31-band the photometric behavior of sn  2003gs was more like a mid - range decliner than a fast decliner .",
    "if we use the unstretched maximum light @xmath32- and @xmath20-band templates of @xcite , the @xmath32- and @xmath20-band maxima were approximately 0.13 mag brighter than our earliest observations .",

    "the early - time colors of sne 2001el and 2006mr have been excluded from the fits . given the reduced @xmath44 values and the @xmath110.2 mag rms scatter of the fits to the early - time data of sne 1999by , 2003gs , 2005bl , and 2005ke , we should not consider these colors to be `` uniform '' .",
    "but we find that the @xmath40 and @xmath41 colors of the fast decliners are remarkably uniform after @xmath42 + 30 d , and identical to the unreddened colors of the mid - range decliner sn  2001el .",

    "we are reminded of the so - called `` lira law '' for the @xmath22 colors of type ia sne starting at @xmath42 + 32 d. the only late - time outliers in the @xmath40 and @xmath41 plots are the @xmath40 data of sn  2003gs , which are apparently redder than other objects due to an interesting bump in the @xmath32-band spectra of sn  2003gs after @xmath42 + 45 d @xcite .",
    "@xcite first showed that a stack of @xmath23-band light curves , ordered by the optical decline rate parameter , exhibits weaker and weaker secondary maxima as we proceed from the slowest to the fastest decliners .",
    "if we consider the mean flux 20 to 40 days after the time of @xmath3-band maximum , typical mid - range decliners have a secondary maximum that is 0.5 times as strong as the i - band maximum ( * ? ? ?",

    "many type ia sne observed by the carnegie supernova project ( csp ) show the same phenomenon @xcite .",
    "the secondary hump is apparently maximized in the 1.03 @xmath45 m band . according to @xcite , it is due to a change of opacity , when the expanding fireball undergoes a transition from primarily doubly ionized species to singly ionized ones .",

    "it is also possible that the depth of the surrounding envelope is approximately the same , but the opacities at these wavelengths are reduced by some other mechanism . in  [ bolo_lc ] we showed that sn  2003gs has a larger @xmath2ni mass than other fast declining type ia sne ( see table [ nickel ] ) . in any case",
    ", this is an important clue to understanding the photometric behavior of sn  2003gs , which indicates a faster than normal decline from approximately normal peak brightness . if the envelope surrounding the iron and cobalt line - forming regions is not as deep or is more transparent than in normal type ia sne , then @xmath1 rays that power the luminosity will escape more easily and the decline rate will increase .",

    "these objects were subluminous in the optical band passes , but their near - ir maximum light absolute magnitudes were statistically equal to those of the slow decliners and mid - range decliners . also , the near - ir maxima of these four objects apparently occurred prior to the time of @xmath3-band maximum light . in the case of sn",

    "there appears to be a bimodal distribution of near - ir absolute magnitudes of type ia sne at maximum light .",
