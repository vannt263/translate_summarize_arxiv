    "control through adjusting the state of the environment in general does not preserve quantum coherence in the controlled system and for this reason is called incoherent  @xcite .",

    "other environments , either markovian or non - markovian , can also be used as incoherent controls ; however , the ability to use a particular environment for engineering arbitrary quantum states using the proposed scheme requires a separate analysis in each case .",

    "the scheme to steer @xmath40 into @xmath43 consists of two stages . in the first stage ,",
    "the system evolves on the time scale of several orders of magnitude of the relaxation time , @xmath44 ( where @xmath45 can be chosen in the range @xmath46 depending on the required degree of accuracy ) under the action of a suitable optimal incoherent control @xmath47 into the state @xmath48 diagonal in the basis of @xmath20 and having the same spectrum as the final state @xmath43 .",

    "the system evolves on the fast ( e.g. femto - second ) time scale under the action of a suitable coherent laser control which rotates the basis of @xmath20 to match the basis of @xmath43 .",
    "the first stage exploits incoherent control with any @xmath47 such that @xmath50 to prepare the system in the state @xmath49 .",

    "the first stage when necessary can be divided into two parts , diagonalization of the density matrix with any @xmath28 producing positive and sufficiently large @xmath63 , followed by the evolution produced by any @xmath47 such that @xmath50 to produce @xmath49 .",
    "the second stage implements coherent dynamics with unitary evolution transforming the basis @xmath64 into @xmath65 and hence steering @xmath49 into @xmath43 . for successful realization of this stage",
    "we assume that any unitary evolution operator of the system can be produced with available coherent controls when @xmath66 on a time scale sufficiently shorter than @xmath0 , i.e. that the system is unitary controllable when decoherence effects are negligible .",
    "incoherent control is switched off during this stage by setting @xmath67 and the dynamics is well approximated by the unitary evolution  ( [ sec2:eq2 ] ) .",

    "the second stage can be implemented also on the long time scale using dynamical decoupling  @xcite to effectively decouple the system from the environment .",
    "there exist other methods to prepare arbitrary quantum states .",
    "an example is the method of engineering arbitrary kraus maps proposed by lloyd and viola  @xcite which in particular can be used to produce arbitrary quantum states .",

    ". this advantage should significantly simplify practical realization when individual addressing of quantum systems is hard to realize .",
    "we remark that the first control stage requires individual addressing of each transition frequency .",
    "if the system is non - generic , in particular , is degenerate then the method may work if the degenerate states can be selectively addressed by using polarization of the incoherent radiation . for degenerate systems ( harmonic oscillator )",
    "another scheme was proposed  @xcite .",
    "determining the correct form of the master equation for systems with time dependent hamiltonians in general is a non - trivial problem  @xcite .",
    "however , the proposed scheme does not use the master equation with time dependent hamiltonian @xmath77 and therefore the problem of choosing the correct form of the master equation with time dependent hamiltonian is not relevant for this work .",
    "the scheme in its first step exploits incoherent control when the coherent control is switched off and therefore the system hamiltonian is time independent . in this case",
    "the system dynamics under markovian approximation is governed by a master equation of the form  ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the second step exploits fast coherent control on a short time scale when incoherent control is switched off and the decoherence effects are negligible . in this case @xmath78 and the dynamics is well approximated by  ( [ sec2:eq2 ] ) .     and @xmath71 .",
    "in ( b ) , the objective @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the output state , is measured ( block with letter  m  ) at the end of each iteration and the result is used to design a new control , ideally with better performance .",
    "the cycle is repeated until obtaining a satisfactory output . ]",

    "depending on a particular problem , various notions of controllability for quantum systems are used  @xcite , including unitary controllability , pure state , density matrix and observable controllability  @xcite , and complete density matrix controllability  @xcite .",
    "unitary controllability means the ability to produce with available controls any unitary evolution operator @xmath70 .",
    "density matrix controllability means the ability to transfer one into another arbitrary density matrices with the same spectrum ( i.e. , kinematically equivalent density matrices ) ; a particular case is pure state controllability as the ability to transfer one into another arbitrary pure states .",
    "complete density matrix controllability means the ability to steer any initial ( pure or mixed ) density matrix @xmath40 into any ( pure or mixed ) final density matrix @xmath82 , irrespective of their relative spectra  @xcite .",
    "this notion is different from density matrix controllability  @xcite , where only kinematically equivalent density matrices are required to be accessible one from another , and is the strongest among all degrees of state controllability for quantum systems ; complete density matrix controllability of a quantum system implies in particular its pure state and density matrix controllability .",
    "the suggested scheme allows for transferring one into another arbitrary density matrices thereby approximately realizing complete density matrix controllability of quantum systems  the strongest possible degree of their state control .",
    "an all - to - one control @xmath1 is a control which steers all initial states into one final state .",
    "such controls can be optimal simultaneously for all initial states  @xcite and their importance is motivated by the following .",

    "<S> controlled manipulation by atoms and molecules using external controls is an active field of modern research with applications ranging from selective creation of atomic or molecular excitations out to control of chemical reactions or design of nanoscale systems with desired properties </S>",
    "<S> . the external control may be either coherent ( e.g. , a tailored laser pulse  @xcite ) or incoherent ( e.g. , a specially adjusted or engineered environment  @xcite or quantum measurements commonly used with and sometimes without feedback  @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> a challenging topic in quantum control is to provide practical methods for engineering arbitrary quantum states  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the interest to this topic is driven by fundamental connections to quantum physics as well as by potential applications to quantum state measurement  @xcite and quantum computing with mixed states and non - unitary quantum gates  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> various recipes for engineering arbitrary quantum states of light were proposed  @xcite . for matter , engineering arbitrary open system s quantum dynamics with coherent control , quantum measurements and feedback was shown to be achievable  @xcite . however , the problem of deterministic engineering of arbitrary quantum states of matter has generally been remained unsolved .    </S>",
    "<S> this works proposes the first , to the best of the author s knowledge , deterministic method for engineering arbitrary pure and mixed density matrices for a wide class of quantum systems . </S>",
    "<S> the method uses a combination of incoherent control by engineering the state of the environment ( for which we consider appropriately filtered incoherent radiation ) on the time scale of several orders of magnitude of the characteristic system relaxation time @xmath0 followed by fast ( e.g. , femto - second ) coherent laser control to produce arbitrary pure and mixed states for a wide class of quantum systems . </S>",
    "<S> the method is deterministic in the sense that it does not use real - time feedback and can be applied to an ensemble of systems without the need for an individual addressing of each system . </S>",
    "<S> important is that the suggested scheme requires the ability to manipulate by both hamiltonian and non - hamiltonian aspects of the dynamics ; a fundamental result of altafini shows that varying only the hamiltonian is not sufficient to produce arbitrary states of a quantum system  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> engineered environments were suggested for improving quantum computation and quantum state engineering  @xcite , making robust quantum memories  @xcite , preparing many - body states and non - equilibrium quantum phases  @xcite , inducing multiparticle entanglement dynamics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this work exploits incoherent control by engineered environment  @xcite in a combination with coherent control for producing arbitrary pure and mixed density matrices . </S>",
    "<S> while incoherent processes were used in various circumstances , as for example in cold molecule research , to prepare a pure state needed for a full control over the system s pure states  @xcite , their use in the proposed method serves for a more general goal of engineering arbitrary pure and mixed quantum states .    </S>",
    "<S> the method has two special properties . </S>",
    "<S> first , it implements complete density matrix controllability  the strongest possible degree of state control for quantum systems meaning the ability to prepare in a controllable way any density matrix starting from any initial state . </S>",
    "<S> second , the produced controls are all - to - one  any such control @xmath1 transfers all pure and mixed initial states into the same final state and thus can be optimal simultaneously for all initial states  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this property has no analog for purely coherent control of closed quantum systems with unitary evolution , where different initial states in general require different optimal controls . </S>",
    "<S> while an abstract theoretical construction of all - to - one controls was provided  @xcite , the problem of their physical realization has remained open . </S>",
    "<S> the suggested method provides a solution for such a physical realization . </S>"
