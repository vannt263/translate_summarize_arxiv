    "measurement and interpretation of `` elliptic flow '' ( @xmath8 ) is considered of central importance to the rhic program because it provides the main support for interpretation of rhic collisions as producing sqgp  a thermalized _ strongly - coupled _ partonic medium with very low viscosity , sometimes described as a `` perfect liquid ''  @xcite .",
