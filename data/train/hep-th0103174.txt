    "the results by seiberg and witten were extended to the case with the explicit soft susy breaking terms by using spurion technique .",
    "unless these terms do not change the holomorphy and duality properties of the theory , we can derive the exact effective action for @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( non - supersymmetric ) susy gauge theories up to the leading order for the soft susy breaking terms . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the exact superpotential and the phase structure in @xmath5 sqcd were discussed based on the @xmath0 susy gauge theory with some soft breaking terms . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the vacuum structure of non - susy gauge theory was investigated in which soft susy breaking terms directly break @xmath0 susy to @xmath7=0 .    in this paper , we study a spontaneously broken @xmath0 susy gauge theory .",
    "it is well known that , in the frame work of @xmath0 susy theory , the only possibility to break susy spontaneously is to introduce the fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) term .",
    "therefore , in the following , we consider the gauge theory which includes @xmath3 gauge interaction together with the fi term .",
    "the simplest example of this type of theory is @xmath0 susy qed ( sqed ) with the fi term @xcite . at the classical level , although susy is spontaneously broken in coulomb branch , there are degenerate vacua ( moduli space ) parameterized by the vacuum expectation value of the scalar field , @xmath8 , in the @xmath3 vectormultiplet . the direction of this vacuum degeneracy in the absence of susy",
    "is called `` pseudo flat '' direction .",
    "however , it is expected that this direction is lifted up , once quantum corrections are taken into account . by virtue of @xmath0 susy , the effective action is found to be one loop exact , and the effective gauge coupling is given by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the landau pole .",
    "note that there are two singular regions in moduli space , namely , the ultraviolet ( uv ) region such as @xmath11 and the massless singular point at the origin @xmath12 .",
    "since the effective potential is described as @xmath13 , the potential minimum emerges at the origin , where susy is formally restored .",

    "the potential minimum is obtained by solving the stationary conditions with respect to these scalar components .",

    "this naive expectation seems natural , if we notice that the above potential energy is described by the bare gauge couplings , which should be replaced by the effective one ( non - trivial functions of moduli parameters ) in the effective theory .",

    "the exact effective lagrangian , if it could be obtained , can be expanded with respect to the parameter @xmath26 as @xmath41 here , the first term @xmath42 is the exact effective lagrangian containing full susy quantum corrections .",

    ", we obtain the effective potential of the order of @xmath43 .",
    "the coefficient of @xmath43 in the effective potential includes full susy quantum corrections .",
    "therefore , what we need to analyze the effective potential is nothing but the effective lagrangian @xmath42 .    except the fi term , the classical @xmath14 gauge theory has moduli space , which is parameterized by @xmath35 and @xmath34 . on this moduli space except the origin ,",

    "we should make it clear how to treat the @xmath3 gauge interaction part . in the following analysis ,",
    "this part is , as usual , discussed as a cut - off theory .",
    "thus , the landau pole @xmath10 is inevitably introduced in our effective theory , and the defined region of the moduli parameter @xmath34 is constrained within the region @xmath46 . according to this constraint , the defined region for moduli parameter @xmath35",
    "is found to be also constrained in the same region , since two moduli parameters are related with each other through the hypermultiplets .",
    "we take the scale of @xmath10 to be much larger than the dynamical scale of the @xmath4 gauge interaction @xmath47 , so that the @xmath3 gauge interaction is always weak in the defined region of moduli space .",
    "note that , in our framework , we implicitly assume that the @xmath3 gauge interaction has no effect on the @xmath4 gauge dynamics .",
    "this assumption is justified in the following discussion about the monodromy transformation ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : mono ] ) ) .",
    "we first discuss the general formulae for the effective lagrangian @xmath42 , which consists of two parts described by light vectormultiplets and hypermultiplets , @xmath48 .",

    "this part should be added to the effective lagrangian around a singular point on moduli space , since the hypermultiplet is expected to be light there and enjoys the correct degrees of freedom in the effective theory .",
    "the explicit description is given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 denote light quark or light dyon hypermultiplet  ( the bps states ) , and @xmath62 is the dual gauge field of @xmath45 .    in order to obtain an explicit description of the effective lagrangian ,",
    "let us consider the monodromy transformation of our theory .",
    "suppose that moduli space is parameterized by the vectormultiplet scalars @xmath35 , @xmath34 and their duals @xmath63 , @xmath64 which are defined as @xmath65 ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "these variables are transformed into their linear combinations by the monodromy transformation . in our case , the monodromy transformation is subgroup of @xmath66 , which leaves the effective lagrangian invariant , and the general formula is found to be @xcite @xmath67 where @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 . note that this monodromy transformation for the combination @xmath71 is exactly the same as that for sqcd with massive quark hypermultiplets , if we regard @xmath34 as the same mass of the hypermultiplets such that @xmath72 .",
    "this means that the @xmath3 gauge interaction part plays the only role as the mass term for the @xmath4 gauge dynamics .",
    "this observation is consistent with our assumption . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath4 dynamics plays an important role for the @xmath3 gauge interaction part , as can be seen in the transformation law of @xmath64 .",
    "this monodromy transformation is also used to derive dual variables associated with the bps states . as a result ,",

    ", we obtain three solutions as follows : @xmath82 the solution ( [ eq : sol2 ] ) or ( [ eq : sol3 ] ) , in which the light hypermultiplet acquires the vacuum expectation value , is energetically favored , because of @xmath83 and @xmath84 . since the hypermultiplet appears in the theory as the light bps state around the singular point on moduli space ,",
    "the potential minimum is expected to emerge there .",
    "on the other hand , the solution ( [ eq : sol1 ] ) describes the potential energy away from the singular points , which smoothly connects to the solution ( [ eq : sol2 ] ) or ( [ eq : sol3 ] ) .",
