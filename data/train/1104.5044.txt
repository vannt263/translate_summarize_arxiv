    "in evolutionary genomics , two genomes are frequently compared by the minimum number of ` rearrangements ' ( of various types ) required to transform one genome into another @xcite .",
    "this minimum number is then used to estimate of the actual number of events and thereby the ` evolutionary distance ' between the species involved . since both the precise number and the actual rearrangement events that occurred in the evolution of the two genomes from a common ancestor are unknown",
    ", it is pertinent to have some idea of how sensitive this distance estimate might be to the sequence of events ( not just the number ) that really took place @xcite .",
    "this question has important implications for the accurate inference of evolutionary relationships between species from their genomes , and we discuss some of these further in section  [ stats ] .",
    "however , we begin by framing the type of mathematical questions that we will be considering in a general algebraic context .",
    "let @xmath4 be a finite group , whose identity element we write as @xmath5 , and let @xmath6 be a subset of generators , that is _ symmetric _",
    "( i.e. closed under inverses , so @xmath7 ) . in addition , let @xmath8 be the associated _ cayley graph _ , with vertex set @xmath4 and an edge connecting @xmath9 and @xmath10 if there exists @xmath11 with @xmath12 ( unless otherwise stated , we use the convention of multiplying group elements from left to right ) .",
    "for any two elements @xmath13 , the distance @xmath14 in @xmath15 is the minimum value of @xmath16 for which there exist elements @xmath17 of @xmath6 so that @xmath18 ( for @xmath19 , we set @xmath20 ) .",
    "note that @xmath21 is a metric , in particular , @xmath22 , since @xmath6 is symmetric .    in this paper ,",
    "our focus is on the following two quantities : @xmath23 @xmath24    one way to view these quantities is via the following result which is easily proved .",
    "[ interpret ] let @xmath6 be a symmetric set of generators for a finite group @xmath4 . then :    * @xmath25 is the maximum value of @xmath14 between any pair of elements @xmath9 and @xmath10 of @xmath4 for which @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 for all but at most one value ( say @xmath29 ) for @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "* @xmath32 is the maximum value of @xmath14 between any pair of elements @xmath9 and @xmath10 of @xmath4 for which @xmath26 and @xmath27 where @xmath28 for all but at most one value ( say @xmath29 ) for @xmath30 , and @xmath33 .",
    "thus , @xmath25 tells us how much ( under @xmath21 ) a product of generators can change if we drop one value of @xmath34 , whilst @xmath32 tells us how much ( again under @xmath21 ) a product of generators in @xmath6 can change if we substitute one value of @xmath34 by another @xmath35 ( see fig . 1 for an example where @xmath36 ) .    [ figure0 ]    as such , @xmath37 is a measure of the ` sensitivity ' of walks in the cayley graph to a switch in or deletion of a generator at some point .",
    "moreover , if @xmath4 acts transitively and freely acts _ transitively _ on @xmath0 if for any pair @xmath38 there exists @xmath39 with @xmath40 ; the action is _ free _ if @xmath41 , for all @xmath42 and @xmath43 , where ` @xmath44 ' denotes the action of @xmath4 on @xmath0 . ] on a set @xmath0 then @xmath37 provides a corresponding measure of sensitivity of this action to a switch in or deletion of a generator ( since a transitive , free action of @xmath4 on @xmath0 is isomorphic to the action of @xmath4 on itself by right multiplication ) . actions with large @xmath37 values can thus be viewed as exhibiting a discrete , group - theoretic analogue of the ` butterfly effect ' in non - linear dynamics ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in the genomics applications that we shall consider , elements of the group @xmath4 correspond to genomes , and @xmath21 to the evolutionary distance between them .",
    "after presenting some general results concerning @xmath37 in the next section , in sections  [ genome ] and [ break ] we discuss some applications arising for various choices of @xmath4 and @xmath6 .",
    "these include the klein four group , which arises in evolutionary models of dna sequence evolution , and the permutatation group , which typically appears when studying rearrangement distances between genomes .",
    "we conclude in section  [ stats ] with some statistical implications of our results .",
    "one can imagine many other settings besides genomics where similar questions arise  for example , in a sequence of moves that should unscramble the rubik s cube from a given position @xcite , what will be the consequences ( in terms of the number of moves required ) for completing the unscrambling if a mistake is made at some point ( or one move is forgotten ) ?",
    "in addition , related questions arise in the study of ` automatic ' groups , where the group under consideration is typically infinite @xcite .",
    "we first make some basic observations about cayley graphs and the metric @xmath21 ( further background on basic group theory , cayley graphs , and group actions can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "it is well known that @xmath45 is a connected regular graph of degree equal to the cardinality of @xmath6 and that @xmath45 is also vertex - transitive ( see , for example , @xcite , proposition 1 ) .",

    ". moreover , for the abelian 2-group @xmath79 and with the symmetric set @xmath6 of generators consisting of all @xmath80 elements with the identity at all but one position , we have @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "this shows that the inequality @xmath83 can be arbitrarily large .",

    "our motivation here is to provide some basis for eventually extending the well - developed ( and tight ) results on the sequence length requirements for tree reconstruction under site - substitution models ( see e.g. @xcite ) to more general models of genome evolution .",
    "consider any model of genome evolution , where an associated transformation group @xmath4 acts freely on a set @xmath0 of genomes of length @xmath80 , and for which events in some symmetric generating set @xmath6 occur independently according to a poisson process .",
    "regard the elements of @xmath0 as leaves of an evolutionary ( phylogenetic ) tree with weighted edges @xcite , and let @xmath327 be the sum of the weights of the edges of the tree connecting leaves @xmath328",
    ". then we make the following assumption :    * the expected number of times that @xmath11 occurs along the path in the tree connecting @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be written as @xmath329 ( i.e. we assume that the rate of events scales linearly with the length of the genome ) .",
    "* @xmath332 depends just on @xmath9 , for each @xmath43 and @xmath39 .",
    "* @xmath333 is independent of @xmath80 . *",
    "@xmath334 where @xmath335 is the expected value in the model of @xmath336 and @xmath337 is a function with strictly positive but bounded first derivative on @xmath338 .",
    "an example to illustrate this process is site substitutions , under the kimura 3st model , described at the start of section [ genome ] , taking @xmath339 , where we observed that properties ( i ) and ( ii ) hold ( note that in this case , @xmath336 is the ` hamming distance ' between the sequences which counts the number of sites at which @xmath1 and @xmath2 differ ) . in that case ,",
    "property ( iii ) also holds , since @xmath340 note that , both breakpoint distance and @xmath21 satisfy ( i ) , and we have described above some cases where ( ii ) is satisfied . whether ( iii ) holds ( or the assumption that the expected number of events scales linearly with @xmath80 ) depends on the details of the underlying stochastic process of genome rearrangement .",
    "for example , for the approximation to the nadeau - taylor model of genome rearrangement studied in section 2 of @xcite , property ( iii ) holds under the assumption that the number of events separating @xmath1 and @xmath2 has a poisson distribution whose mean scales linearly with @xmath80 ( the proof relies on corollary 1(a ) of @xcite ) .",
    "the following result shows how @xmath341 can be used to estimate @xmath342 accurately , and thereby @xmath327 ( by the assumptions regarding @xmath337 ) .",
    "the ability to estimate @xmath327 accurately provides a direct route to accurate tree reconstruction by standard phylogenetic methods ( such as ` neighbor - joining ' @xcite ) since @xmath327 is ` additive ' on the underlying tree but not on alternative binary trees ( for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "[ random ] consider any stochastic model of genome evolution for which events in @xmath6 occur according to a poisson process with a rate that scales linearly with @xmath80 , and any metric @xmath288 that satisfies conditions ( i ) (iii ) above .",
    "then the probability that @xmath343 differs from @xmath342 by more than @xmath344 converges to zero exponentially quickly with increasing @xmath80 .",
    "more precisely , for constants @xmath345 and @xmath346 that depend just on @xmath327 and on the pair @xmath347 ) , respectively , we have : @xmath348 for @xmath349 .",
    "_ proof of proposition [ random ] : _ we first recall the azuma - hoeffding inequality ( see e.g. @xcite ) in which @xmath350 are independent random variables taking values in some set @xmath6 , and @xmath351 is _ any _ real - valued function defined on @xmath6 that satisfies the following property for some constant @xmath352 : @xmath353 whenever @xmath354 and @xmath355 differ at just one coordinate . in this case , the random variable @xmath356 has the tight concentration bound for all @xmath357 : @xmath358| \\geq z ) \\leq 2\\exp(-\\frac{z^2}{2\\xi^2k}).\\ ] ] we apply this general result as follows .",
    "let @xmath165 be the random total number of events in @xmath6 that occur in the path separating @xmath1 and @xmath2 . by assumption",
    ", @xmath165 has a poisson distribution with mean @xmath359 .",
    "conditional on the event @xmath360 , let @xmath361 be the actual elements of @xmath6 that occur .",
    "it is assumed that these events are independent .",
    "moreover , by ( i ) , @xmath336 is a function of @xmath361 , and by ( ii ) this function satisfies the requirements of the azuma - hoeffding inequality for @xmath362 .",
    "thus ( [ azuma ] ) furnishes the following inequality : @xmath363 invoking property ( iii ) and the law of total probability , we obtain : @xmath364 from which ( [ azh ] ) ensures the inequality : @xmath365,\\ ] ] where @xmath366 denotes expectation with respect to @xmath165 .",
    "let us write @xmath367 $ ] as a weighted sum of two conditional expectations : @xmath368\\cdot p + \\\\   { { \\mathbb e}}[\\exp(-\\frac{z^2n^2}{2\\lambda^2k})|k \\leq 2n \\cdot   \\mu(x , y ) ] \\cdot(1-p),\\ ] ] where @xmath369 . the first term in ( [ pp2 ] ) is bounded above by @xmath370 since @xmath371 ; moreover , since @xmath165 has a poisson distribution with mean @xmath359 ( and so is asymptotically normally distributed with mean and variance equal to @xmath372 ) , the quantity @xmath370 is bounded above by a term of the form @xmath373 where @xmath374 depends just on @xmath327 .",
    "@xmath104 + * remark .",
    "* referring again to the particular case of site substitutions under the kimura 3st model , proposition  [ random ] can be strengthened to : @xmath379 where @xmath380 can be chosen to be independent of @xmath327 .",
    "this stronger result is the basis of numerous results in the phylogenetic literature that show that large trees can be reconstructed from remarkably short sequences under simple site - substitution models @xcite .",
    "although the bound in proposition [ random ] is less incisive , it would be of interest to explore similar phylogenetic applications for other models of genome evolution in which @xmath182 is independent of @xmath80 , such as those involving breakpoint distance under reversals of fixed length .",
