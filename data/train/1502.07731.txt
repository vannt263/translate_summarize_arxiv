    ", these orthogonal orbitals are represented as a linear combination of atomic orbitals ( ao s ) with orbital coefficients * c * : @xmath13 , where we use greek letters ( @xmath14 ) to denote ao orbitals .",
    "the geometry dependence of the integrals arises from the ao functions , which ( as gaussian type basis functions ) explicitly depend on the nuclear positions , as well as through the lcao coefficient matrix @xmath15 , which also changes with geometry . the hamiltonian may be regarded as a function of the nuclear coordinates @xmath16 and the coefficient matrix @xmath17 : @xmath18 . as the electronic wavefunction @xmath19 depends on variational parameters @xmath20 ,",
    "the electronic energy is a function of @xmath21 , @xmath17 , and @xmath22 : @xmath23 .",
    "the energy gradient with respect to nuclear coordinate @xmath24 takes the form @xmath25 if @xmath19 is determined variationally , the energy is stationary to changes of @xmath26 , thus the third term vanishes .",
    "the gradient then only depends on the change in nuclear coordinates and orbital coefficients , @xmath27    it is convenient to rewrite the energy gradient in terms of density matrices .",
    "the energy is expressed as @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the one- and two - particle density matrices .",
    "since the second - quantized operators have no dependence on geometry , and the wavefunction depends only on @xmath22 , it follows from eq .",

    "in general , the orbital derivative @xmath47 requires the solution of equations which couple the wavefunction coefficients @xmath48 to the orbital coefficients @xmath49 . however , there are two common situations where the orbital response is simplified .",

    ", the orbital response @xmath50 is defined by the hartree - fock convergence condition , @xmath51 which leads to the definition of the @xmath50 matrix @xmath52 where @xmath53 with @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and the various @xmath56 are hf orbital energies .",

    "the second simplifying case is when the correlated wavefunction energy is itself stationary with respect to orbital variations . in this case @xmath57 , and the orbital response",
    "is not required , even though it is formally coupled to the correlated variational wavefunction coefficients .",
    "the energy gradient reduces to the simpler form , @xmath58",
    "the dmrg is a variational wavefunction method@xcite . for a set of @xmath59 orthogonal orbitals ( where the states for the @xmath36th orbital are @xmath60 ) we choose a partitioning of the orbitals into a left block , single site , and right block , consisting of orbitals @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively . the corresponding canonical `` one - site '' dmrg wavefunction takes the matrix product form @xmath64 the ( rotation ) matrices @xmath65 and @xmath66 are of dimension @xmath67 , except for the first and last which are of dimension @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively .",

    "the dmrg sweep algorithm is normally used . here , at a given step @xmath76 of the sweep ,",

    "an important aspect of dmrg calculations is the enforcement of symmetries , including global symmetries such as the total particle number and spin . in the dmrg wavefunction , abelian global symmetries ( such as total particle number )",
    "are enforced by local quantum numbers .",
    "for example , to enforce a total particle number of @xmath86 in the wavefunction , each value of the 3 indices @xmath87 , @xmath88 in the matrix elements @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 can be associated with an additional integer @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 .",
    "( these values can be interpreted in terms of the particle numbers of the renormalized states ( for @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) and for the states of the single site ( for @xmath94 ) ) .",
    "then , a total particle number of @xmath86 is enforced with the rules : @xmath95 applying these conditions to @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 means that the matrices have a block - sparse structure , which is important to maintain during geometry optimization .",

    "for the dark state , however , the precision of the optimized geometry was more sensitive to the choice of @xmath97 for the longer polyenes . this may not be surprising , as the first optically bright state is mainly a single - reference state , while the lower dark state has more challenging multi - reference character  @xcite . for all the polyenes",
