    "both galaxy clusters and individual early - type galaxies contain virialized hot gas in which the radiative cooling time is much less than the hubble time .",
    "according to the standard interpretation , as hot gas loses energy by emitting the x - radiation we observe , it slowly migrates inward . since these `` cooling flows '' are nearly in hydrostatic equilibrium in the cluster or galactic potential ,",
    "the temperature and density profiles measured in the hot gas can be used to determine the underlying mass distribution . for this reason it is particularly interesting to study cooling flows in galaxies since we already have information about the mass distribution from optical studies within the half - light radius @xmath6 where the contribution of dark matter to the total mass is small .",
    "our objective in the calculations discussed here is to determine the nature of the interaction between cluster and interstellar gas in bright cd galaxies centrally located in galaxy clusters . in our previous studies of x - ray luminous massive elliptical galaxies located in small galaxy groups ( e.g. brighenti & mathews 1999 )",
    ", we have assumed that the interstellar and circumgalactic gas have been relatively unperturbed since the galaxy first formed . by following the growth of cosmological perturbations , including star formation and feedback",
    ", we can compute the gas flow over most of the hubble time , successfully reproducing the radial dependence of hot gas density , temperature and abundance currently observed in massive group - centered elliptical galaxies .",
    "however , the hot gas surrounding cluster - centered elliptical galaxies has a much higher cluster virial temperature .",
    "as cluster gas flows into the central cd or elliptical galaxy , the interstellar gas is perturbed from that of more isolated or group - centered ellipticals , providing a useful test of the many parameters involved in these calculations .",
    "in particular , cluster - centered cd galaxies provide an excellent venue to explore the nature or reality of the mass `` dropout '' hypothesis , i.e. that the hot gas is multiphase , having locally varying densities and cooling times , so that it cools ( `` drops out '' ) throughout a large volume of the cooling flow .",
    "unfortunately , the long term evolution of ambient cluster gas around cluster - centered cd galaxies is uncertain because of the likelihood of disruptive mergers in the cluster environment .",
    "nevertheless , much can be learned if we assume that the cluster gas as currently observed near the cd galaxy has been relatively stable for times longer than several sound - crossing times , typically several gyrs .    in the traditional interpretation of cooling flows",
    ", it is assumed that the x - ray luminosity @xmath7 reflects energy lost from the hot gas which is not balanced by a heating source .",
    "as the radiating gas loses energy and slowly migrates toward the potential minimum , it is maintained near the local virial temperature by @xmath8 compression . in the simplest ( single phase )",
    "cooling flows all the gas cools rapidly at very center of the e or cd galaxy where the gas density and radiative emission are greatest .",
    "this model clearly fails since strong localized central peaks of thermal x - ray emission are not generally observed and the total mass of cooled gas concentrated in the central regions would increase the stellar velocity dispersions considerably above those observed ( e.g. thomas 1986 ; white & sarazin 1987 ; mathews & brighenti 2000 ) . to alleviate these difficulties ,",
    "it has been fashionable for many years to assume that the hot gas is `` multiphase '' and therefore cools throughout a larger volume , depositing its mass in a less concentrated manner ( nulsen 1986 ; thomas et al . 1987 ; allen et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "multiphase cooling can be incorporated into the equation of continuity for cooling flows with a mass sink term : @xmath9 the source term proportional to the stellar density @xmath10 represents stellar mass ejected from evolving stars . the following dropout or sink term simply removes gas from the flow at a rate characterized by the local radiative cooling time at constant pressure @xmath11 .",
    "this term is preceded by a dimensionless coefficient @xmath12 which is adjusted to best fit the observed x - ray surface brightness and other observations .",
    "we recognize the _ ad hoc _ character of this sink term , particularly in view of the well known failure of linear analysis to find instability in cooling flows ( e.g. balbus & soker 1989 ) . nevertheless , the compelling astrophysical arguments against concentrated cooling at the center of the flow suggest either some form of distributed mass dropout as in equation ( 1 ) or an equally _ ad hoc _ heating effect that supplies thermal energy without driving a strong global wind .",
    "ironically , we have recently shown ( brighenti & mathews 2002 ) that nonlinear density perturbations and subsequent thermal instabilities occur naturally in cooling flows that are decelerated by heating or additional non - thermal pressure near the center of the flow .    to estimate @xmath13 we use the recent compilation of six",
    "well - observed cluster cooling flows from allen et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for which the local radiative cooling times are linear functions of radius , @xmath14 , for @xmath15 . since @xmath16 kpc is much greater than the central galactic half - light radius @xmath17 kpc , @xmath18 beyond the central galaxy .",
    "multiplying the equation above by @xmath19 , assuming quasi - steady state flow and substituting @xmath20 , @xmath21 we see that @xmath22 implies @xmath5 as verified by figure 6 of allen et al . who determine consistent mass flow or dropout profiles",
    "@xmath4 from both spectroscopic and surface brightness observations . integrating this equation to @xmath23 and rearranging we find @xmath24 which is constant in @xmath15 in this simple approximation . using data from the six well - observed clusters in allen et al .",
    ", we find @xmath25 .",
    "but the implication that @xmath22 requires @xmath5 is very sensitive to the steady state assumption as we show in section 4 below .    recently , _ xmm _ and _ chandra _ have revealed new and unexpected attributes of galactic and cluster cooling flows ( mcnamara et al . 2000 ; fabian et al . 2001 ; fabian 2001 ) .",
    "in several cluster cooling flows there is spectroscopic evidence for only partial cooling , down to @xmath26 kev , but no further ( e. g. peterson et al .",
    "2001 ; tamura et al . 2001 ; kaastra et al .",
    "2001 ; molendi & pizzolato 2001 ; xu et al . 2001 ) .",
    "this has led some to question the reality of the @xmath13-term in the equation of continuity and to postulate instead some as yet poorly understood form of heating ( e.g. tucker & rosner 1983 ; binney & tabor 1995 ; tucker & david 1997 ; ciotti & ostriker 2000 ; soker et al . 2001 ) .",
    "although the traditional mass dropout hypothesis is being challenged , at the present time there is no accepted alternative model with heating that can be compared in detail with observations .",
    "nevertheless , some recent observations continue to support the reality of traditional cooling flows .",
    "buote ( 2000 , 2001 ) finds evidence of widespread x - ray absorption from warm gas at @xmath27 k in many cooling flows including m87 .",
    "fuse observations of cluster a2597 have detected the ovi doublet from gas at @xmath28 k corresponding to a lower than expected @xmath29 , but ovi lines are undetected in a1795 ( oegerle et al .",
    "similar fuse observations of elliptical galaxies find ovi emission consistent with ( but possibly somewhat less than ) the expected mass cooling rate @xmath29 and the usual multiphase cooling flow model ( e.g. bregman et al .",
    "perhaps some ovi line emission may have escaped detection because of broadening by turbulent velocities .",
    "finally , canizares et al .",
    "( 1982 ) discovered line emission in m87 corresponding to temperatures of a few @xmath30 k which they interpret at radiatively cooling gas . although the evidence is somewhat contradictory at present , we adopt provisionally the traditional assumption that cooling flows do in fact cool and seek values of @xmath31 for cluster - centered cd galaxies that agree best with recent x - ray observations .    in the following",
    "we describe the transition flow as cluster gas enters m87 from the virgo cluster and ngc 4874 from the coma cluster , both of which have been observed by _",
    "xmm _ and/or _ chandra_. remarkably , there is little evidence that the powerful , ongoing agn in m87 , with its jet and radio lobes , are heating the cooling flow at small galactic radii ( e.g. fabian 2001 ; soker et al .",
    "indeed , we demonstrate below that the gas temperature , density and entropy profiles in m87/virgo and ngc 4874/coma are approximately consistent with a normal galactic - scale cooling flows , requiring little or no additional local heating .",
    "the interaction of cluster and galactic gas has been discussed previously by thomas ( 1986 ) , meiksin ( 1990 ) and bertin & toniazzo ( 1995 ) .",
    "using rosat data , nulsen & bhringer ( 1995 ) determined the azimuthally averaged mass distribution of the virgo cluster within 50   ( 247 kpc at distance @xmath32 mpc ) of m87 .",
    "their best - fitting model has a total density structure @xmath33^{-1}\\ ] ] and mass profile @xmath34\\ ] ] where @xmath35 kpc and @xmath36 @xmath37 .",
    "the mass distribution is sensitive to the observed gas temperature variation @xmath38 which for @xmath39 kpc is approximately isothermal at @xmath40 kev ( @xmath41 k ) ( nulsen & bhringer 1995 ) . the observed x - ray surface brightness in virgo is more consistent with this @xmath42 than with an nfw mass profile , although the difference is not great .",
    "each gas dynamical calculation begins with a determination of the gas density profile of isothermal intracluster gas in hydrostatic equilibrium in the virgo potential defined by @xmath42 .",
    "at cosmic time @xmath58 the central galaxy and its dark halo are inserted into the virgo environment .",
    "after this time stellar mass loss contributes to the local gas at a rate @xmath59 gm s@xmath60 @xmath61 .",
    "here @xmath62 s@xmath60 , appropriate for a nearly coeval burst of star formation at high redshift where @xmath63 s@xmath60 , and @xmath64 gyrs is the present age of the universe .",
    "gas within the optical galaxy is heated by type ia supernovae which occur at a rate snu@xmath65 snu@xmath66 where snu@xmath67 supernovae per @xmath68 @xmath69 per 100 years .",
    "these stellar mass loss and supernova rates are consistent with x - ray observations of massive e galaxies such as ngc 4472 that are not centered in large clusters ( e.g. brighenti & mathews 1999 ) .    after time @xmath58 ,",
    "as the hot intracluster gas flows into the optical galaxy , it is cooled by radiation losses and mass ejected from evolving stars .",
    "since mass - losing stars orbit rapidly through the hot gas , we expect instabilities to thermally mix stellar and ambient gases .",
    "this assumption is confirmed by negative abundance gradients of @xmath70-elements observed in m87 ( molendi & gastaldello 2001 ) which can not have been produced by type ia supernovae . in large galaxies such as m87 , the global potential is so deep that type ia heating has rather little effect on the thermal budget of the gas ; the snia luminosity at @xmath71 , @xmath72 erg s@xmath60 , is considerably less than the total x - ray emission @xmath7 from within the optical image of m87 . following a brief transient ( @xmath73 gyr ) just after m87 is introduced into the virgo environment , the gas flow settles into a subsonic , but secularly changing flow .",
    "the gas dynamical equations that we use are identical to those discussed in brighenti & mathews ( 1999 ) to which we refer the reader for further details .",
    "the equations are solved with a considerably modified 1d spherical version of the zeus code ( stone & norman 1992 ) using 360 logarithmically increasing zones beginning with a central zone of size 15 pc and extending to 2.1 mpc .",
    "the appropriate initial temperature @xmath74 for virgo gas at time @xmath58 depends somewhat on the nature of the assumed mass dropout profile @xmath31 .",
    "if distributed mass dropout is small at large radii , i.e. @xmath75 , the isothermal temperature @xmath74 should be close to that observed by nulsen & bhringer .",
    "but if @xmath76 at large radii , the temperature of the background flow @xmath74 must exceed that observed , which is a weighted average over both background and cooling regions .",
    "the factors that influence the radial variation of gas density and temperature within the optical galaxy at time @xmath64 gyrs are : ( 1 ) the assumed mass dropout profile @xmath31 and therefore @xmath74 , ( 2 ) the central gas density @xmath77 of the hydrostatic cluster gas distribution just before the galaxy is inserted , ( 3 ) the time elapsed since this initial configuration @xmath78 , ( 4 ) the specific stellar mass - loss rate @xmath79 and ( 5 ) thermal conductivity . as we show below , our computed values of @xmath80 and @xmath81 inside and near m87 are only weakly sensitive to the time @xmath78 over which the gas flow evolves after the initial setup , provided @xmath78 is larger than @xmath82 gyr , i.e. several sound crossing times .",
    "the time @xmath78 can be regarded as the ( unknown ) interval since the last major merger event in virgo when the gas density and temperature may have changed appreciably .",
    "while it is unlikely that @xmath83 varies strongly with galactic radius , the normalization coefficient @xmath84 can influence @xmath80 and @xmath81 somewhat .",
    "it is unlikely that thermal conduction plays an important role in the thermal structure of m87/virgo ( e.g. saito & shigeyama 1999 ) .",
    "we find that thermal conduction at @xmath85 of the spitzer ( or saturated ) rate can not occur since the gas temperature would be nearly isothermal at @xmath86 kev even within @xmath87 kpc and this is not observed .",
    "thermal conduction can help reduce the total mass of cooled gas in the central regions of m87 , but this requires that the conductivity be reduced by a carefully chosen factor that preserves the observed temperature profile ( e.g. bertschinger & meiksin 1986 ) .",
    "therefore , in our discussion below we concentrate mostly on the remaining factor that influences the currently observed gas density and temperature distributions : the mass dropout coefficient @xmath31 .      in figures 1 and 2",
    "we compare the observed gas density and temperature profiles in m87/virgo with results of our gas dynamical calculations .",
    "unless otherwise noted , all calculations begin at cosmic time @xmath88 gyrs and continue to the present time @xmath64 gyrs . at time",
    "@xmath58 the hot cluster gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium in the mass distribution @xmath42 .",
    "the cluster gas is isothermal at @xmath89 kev ( @xmath90 k ) for models with @xmath91 at @xmath92 kpc and @xmath93 kev ( @xmath94 k ) for ( globally multiphase ) models with @xmath95 . the central gas density @xmath96 @xmath61 is chosen to agree with x - ray surface brightness observations at radii far beyond the optical extent of m87 .",
    "if @xmath95 throughout the flow , about half of the total x - radiation comes from the cooling elements and the rest comes from the background flow .",
    "we distinguish these two sources of emission in figures 1 and 2 by plotting both the background density @xmath97 ( light solid line ) and the density @xmath98 that would be determined from the combined emission from background and cooling regions ( heavy solid line ) .",
    "this latter @xmath98 can be compared with the density profile determined from observations . in the temperature plots we show three temperatures : the temperature @xmath99 of the hot background gas flow at radius @xmath100 ( dotted lines ) , the mean local emission - weighted temperature @xmath38 including both background and cooling gas ( light solid lines ) , and the emission - weighted temperature @xmath101 which is @xmath38 averaged along the line of sight , including emission from both background flow and cooling gas ( heavy solid lines ) .",
    "@xmath102 is the projected radius . if @xmath103 , @xmath101 is greater than @xmath38 for @xmath104 because emission from hotter gas along the line of sight is included in the weighted average @xmath101 .",
    "the temperature @xmath101 reported by observers is not simply an emission - weighted mean along the line of sight , but is derived by fitting single temperature ( 1 t ) or composite temperature ( 2 t or 1 t + cf ) xspec models to the projected x - ray spectrum .",
    "nevertheless , in the following discussion we assume that our computed @xmath101  which includes effects of @xmath105 as well as cooling dropout when @xmath106  can be directly compared with observed temperatures .    over time",
    "@xmath107 gyrs , cooling flows do not form in virgo without m87 .",
    "if the evolution of the cluster gas after @xmath58 is calculated without m87 , we find that @xmath101 at time @xmath71 rises from @xmath108 kev at the center , reaches 2.6 kev at @xmath109 kpc , then slowly rises toward @xmath74 .",
    "the gas density is similar to @xmath110 for @xmath111 kpc , but within this radius it is much less than observed , @xmath112 @xmath61 and by time @xmath71 no gas has cooled . however , when m87 is introduced at @xmath58 , the central gas density and x - ray surface brightness increase both because of the locally deepened ( stellar ) potential and because of the addition of stellar mass loss .",
    "we find that the deep potential of m87 is sufficient to create a cooling flow in m87/virgo even if stellar mass loss is absent ; this is possible since the virgo virial temperature is only 2 - 3 times larger than that of m87 .",
    "stellar mass loss further cools the cluster gas and increases its density as it flows into the optical galaxy , lowering the radiative cooling time .",
    "figure 1 shows the resulting density and temperature profiles for the @xmath95 model in which cooling dropout occurs uniformly throughout the flow .",
    "the computed density variation @xmath98 ( heavy solid line ) agrees quite well with the gas density observed in m87/virgo .",
    "the density continues to rise in @xmath113 kpc , where the observational data are sparse , but in this region it is likely that the magnetic field is high enough @xmath114 g to flatten the gas density profile .",
    "owen , eilek & keel ( 1990 ) estimate a field of @xmath115 g at @xmath116 kpc .",
    "the projected model temperature profile @xmath101 also agrees reasonably well with observed values but is somewhat lower for @xmath117 kpc and @xmath118 kpc .",
    "m87 observations are more difficult near the center because of non - thermal x - radiation from the active nucleus ( e.g. bhringer et al . 2001 ; molendi & gastaldello 2001 ) , which may explain some of the temperature discrepancy at small @xmath100 , along with a variety of other possible explanations ( see below ) .",
    "the failure of the @xmath95 model to match observed temperatures beyond @xmath119 kpc suggests that @xmath13 may be less than 1 in this region since the observed temperatures in figure 1 increase toward that of the uncooled background gas @xmath99 ( dotted line ) which is @xmath120 kev hotter than @xmath101 .    to explore variable mass dropout",
    ", we show in figure 2 the results of a calculation with a cooling dropout that decreases with gas density and therefore galactic radius , @xmath121 $ ] , but which is otherwise identical to the solution shown in figure 1 . as a function of radius , @xmath76 , 0.5 and 0.1 at @xmath122 , 2.8 and 7.6",
    "kpc respectively .",
    "the agreement with observed density is very good and @xmath101 agrees adequately with observed values .",
    "it is interesting that the observed density @xmath98 and temperature @xmath101 profiles can be fit for either constant or spatially variable @xmath13 , particularly for @xmath1 kpc .",
    "but the observed spectra of the two flows are quite different , as we discuss below .    inside @xmath26 kpc in figure 1 or @xmath123 kpc in figure 2",
    "the computed temperature @xmath101 is somewhat lower than observed .",
    "it is unlikely that this discrepancy is due to shock heating by the m87 agn or radio source . in our experience",
    "the principal long term consequence of local heating is to lower the central gas density with only a very small change in temperature . in any case , _ chandra _ observations provide little or no direct evidence of shock heating in radio galaxies ( e.g. fabian 2000 ) .",
    "several possible explanations for this temperature discrepancy are explored in the additional @xmath121 $ ] solutions shown in figure 3 .",
    "if the time since the initial m87/virgo configuration @xmath78 is @xmath124 gyrs , we find that both @xmath101 and @xmath125 are larger in @xmath126 kpc .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 3 with a solution at @xmath127 gyrs ( long dashed lines ) which is a poor fit to observed @xmath98 and @xmath38 .",
    "however , for @xmath128 gyrs all @xmath101 profiles resemble that in figure 2 . reducing",
    "the normalization of the stellar mass loss rate @xmath84 by a factor of 2 also has a beneficial , but limited affect on @xmath101 ( short dashed line in fig .",
    "however , if the stellar mass to light ratio is twice that of van der marel , @xmath129  and therefore in better agreement with the @xmath130 of faber et al .",
    "( 1997 )  the temperature profile is considerably improved ( solid line ) .",
    "( note : @xmath131 has been reduced by 2 in this model . )    in figure 2 @xmath101 is in excellent agreement with observations in @xmath132 kpc . in this region",
    "the gas is essentially single phase , @xmath133 , and the full line of sight variation @xmath134 \\approx 0.4 - 0.7 $ ] kev is comparable to the cooling flow temperature range @xmath135 in the xspec ( model c ) analysis of molendi & pizzolato ( 2001 ) at @xmath1 kpc .",
    "the multiphase appearance is due entirely to contributions of various single phase temperatures along the line of sight . at smaller radii , @xmath3 kpc , @xmath13 increases , and @xmath101",
    "is reduced by contributions from gas that is cooling below 1 kev .",
    "we have also repeated m87/virgo calculations with no dropout at all , @xmath136 , so that all the gas cools right at the origin .",
    "the results of these calculations agree surprisingly well with observations at @xmath137 kpc , particularly if @xmath83 is also lower .",
    "but there is a major problem . in @xmath138 kpc both the gas density and temperature increase in the ( point source ) potential of the centrally cooled mass , producing a dense , luminous x - ray core .",
    "however , central masses @xmath139 @xmath37 and central peaks in @xmath140 and @xmath7 are not typically observed , so cooling inflows without spatially distributed dropout are unrealistic .      the detailed shape of the density and temperature profiles in m87/virgo can be adequately reproduced with either constant or variable @xmath13 , but this degeneracy can be broken by examining the x - ray spectra of these models in more detail . if @xmath95 as in figure 1 , the line and continuum x - ray spectrum in @xmath92 kpc should consist of two components of approximately equal flux : ( 1 ) a blend of emission from line of sight plasma at temperatures @xmath141 kev , and ( 2 ) emission from regions cooling at every radius through all temperatures @xmath142 . however , if @xmath75 as in our variable @xmath13 model beyond 10 kpc , @xmath101 is determined by only the first of these two components . in the upper panel of figure 4 we show approximate local spectra at @xmath143 kpc for both constant and variable @xmath13 models . for the @xmath144 $ ] flow we use a single temperature ( 1 t ) , solar abundance mekal model ( using xspec version 11.0.1 ) at @xmath145 kev . for the @xmath95 model spectrum",
    "we combine two bolometrically equal components : a 3 kev 1 t spectrum and a mekal cooling flow ( cf ) spectrum with @xmath146 kev .",
    "the difference between the @xmath95 and variable @xmath13 spectra is most apparent near the fe - l line complex near 1 kev which is broadened toward lower energies in the ( 1 t + cf ) spectrum for @xmath95 flow .",
    "the current observational evidence for truly multiphase gas in m87/virgo is contradictory .",
    "buote ( 2001 ) reanalyzed _ rosat _ pspc data from m87/virgo , including the important spectral range down to 0.2 kev , and concluded that a single temperature gas can not explain the x - ray spectrum .",
    "instead , buote finds evidence of emission in the 0.2 - 0.4 kev band from warm ( @xmath27 k ) gas in m87/virgo at almost every radius @xmath147 kpc except , curiously , in the @xmath148 kpc region where the multiphase flow appears to be suppressed .",
    "buote also finds ( oxygen edge ) absorption in the 0.5 - 0.8 kev range throughout m87/virgo consistent with absorption by the same warm gas that emits at lower energies .",
    "the mass of warm gas necessary for this absorption in m87 is enormous , comparable to the total mass of hot gas observed , and it is unclear why the warm gas would not cool further ( see also bonamente et al .",
    "2001 ) . an important part of buote s argument , shown in his figure 4",
    ", is that if data below 0.5 - 0.7 kev is neglected , as many authors have done , the absorbing foreground column @xmath149 greatly exceeds the galactic value ; conversely , if the entire spectrum down to 0.2 kev is considered , the foreground @xmath149 is approximately galactic at every projected radius in m87/virgo , but some warm gas absorption is required .",
    "buote s _ rosat _ data can not easily discriminate between spectra of two temperature plasma and and a single temperature with cooling elements .",

    "data analyzed by bhringer et al .",

    "( 1 ) the only multiphase attributes apparent in m87/virgo spectra are those introduced by the variation of single phase temperatures along the line of sight , and ( 2 ) there is no evidence for intrinsic multiphase gas that is cooling locally . in their best multiphase cooling flow ( model b ) ,",
    "molendi & pizzolato find ( 1 ) that the ( spectroscopic ) total mass deposition rate in m87/virgo is less than 0.5 @xmath37 yr@xmath60 , at least an order of magnitude less than that expected from @xmath7 , and ( 2 ) very large absorbing columns @xmath149 .",
    "they suggest that earlier claims of large soft x - ray absorption are an artifact resulting from the multiphase assumption .",
    "but there remain problems with the model favored by molendi & pizzolato , model c , in which the temperature range viewed along the sight is sufficient to account for the full temperature range observed at all @xmath102 .",
    "they model this temperature range with a partial isobaric cooling flow from @xmath154 to @xmath155 rather than by integrating over the known @xmath38 along the line of sight . but gas can not just cool to some minimum temperature  ether locally as cooling dropout or during its radial flow  and accumulate there since that would eventually distort the entire spectrum toward this low temperature .",
    "this is the conundrum discussed by fabian et al .",
    "( 2001 ) who claim that `` cooling flow '' gas appears to cool to some intermediate temperature @xmath155 , then disappear .",

    "returning to figure 4 , the easily visible low - energy extension of the fe - l line feature , which indicates cooling to very low temperatures , was evidently not seen at @xmath158 kpc by molendi & pizzolato ( 2001 ) in their xmm spectra of m87 .",

    ".2 cm ( 5 ) if we insist that the gas must cool somewhere in the flow , we suggest that this occurs within the optical extent of the central cd galaxy where the gas temperature is close to the galactic virial temperature @xmath0 kev . at such low temperatures",
    "it is observationally more difficult to detect intrinsic multiphase flow than in hotter gas more distant from the cd .",
    "these remarks are specific to ngc4874/coma and m87/virgo ; in more massive cooling flow clusters , the cooled dropout mass may be distributed over a larger spatial region .",
    ".2 cm ( 6 ) unfortunately , when most of the radiative cooling is restricted to the central regions of the cd galaxy ( @xmath3 kpc ) , the mass of cooled gas there may be inconsistent with mass to light ratios determined from stellar kinematics . at early times when most of the cooling mass dropout occurred , the cooled gas probably formed into luminous stars .",
    "stellar h@xmath175 observations suggest that luminous stars may continue to form from cooling dropout . if the dropout mass is nonluminous , as many authors assume , then it is easy to violate observations of the stellar mass to light ratio unless the nonluminous mass is widely dispersed over the inner @xmath180 kpc in m87 .",
    ".2 cm ( 7 ) in this paper we have sought ways to hide the multiphase nature of gas cooling within 10 kpc of the center of m87 and to hide the presence of large masses of optically dark cooled gas there . in spite or our limited success , it is difficult to fully embrace this approach . if m87 were in a much richer cooling flow cluster , it may be impossible to assert that all of the cooled gas accumulates within the central 10 kpc .",
    ".2 cm ( 8) we confirm early studies that the coefficient for thermal conductivity must be unrealistically fine - tuned or entirely negligible to lower the mass deposition rate without disagreeing with the observed temperature profiles .    .2 cm ( 9 ) for the cooling flow models considered here we find that the mass flow rate @xmath243 can be very sensitive to small transient velocities in the flow that have no consequence for @xmath98 and @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore , the often used equation ( 12 ) is incapable of accurately detecting the presence of radially dependent mass dropout @xmath31 in flows that are not completely relaxed , which may apply to the majority of cooling flows . in particular , when flows become nearly single phase at large radius , as indicated by recent _",
    "data , our models suggest that @xmath249 found from equation ( 12 ) predicts a larger mass dropout at the current time than really exists in the flow .",

    "<S> the evolution of hot interstellar gas in cluster - centered cd galaxies and the inflow of gas from the surrounding galaxy clusters are strongly coupled . cooling flows </S>",
    "<S> arise inside the cd galaxy because the deep stellar potential and stellar mass loss increase the gas density and decrease the radiative cooling time within the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> recent x - ray observations of m87 in the virgo cluster and ngc 4874 in coma reveal that the gas temperature beyond about 50 kpc from these cd galaxies is comparable to the virial temperature of the cluster , 3 or 9 kev respectively , but within the optical galaxy the temperature drops to the galactic virial temperature @xmath0 kev . we show that these steep thermal gradients on galactic scales follow naturally from the usual cooling inflow assumptions without recourse to thermal conductivity </S>",
    "<S> . however , most of the gas must radiatively cool ( `` dropout '' ) before it flows to the galactic core , i.e. the gas must be multiphase . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature and density profiles observed in m87 and ngc 4874 can be matched with approximate gas dynamical models calculated over several gyrs with either globally uniform or centrally concentrated multiphase mass dropout . </S>",
    "<S> recent _ xmm _ observations of m87 indicate single phase flow at every radius with no apparent radiative cooling to low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> gas dynamical models can be made consistent with single phase flow for @xmath1 kpc , but to avoid huge central masses of cooled gas , we assume that some distributed cooling dropout occurs near the center of the flow where the gas temperature is @xmath2 kev . the evidence in x - ray spectra for multiphase cooling beginning at lower temperatures @xmath0 kev may be less apparent than for higher temperatures and may have escaped detection . however , even if the mass of cooled gas is distributed within @xmath3 kpc , it is necessary that the mass of cooled gas not conflict with dynamical mass to light determinations . because of small deviations from true steady state flow , we find that the standard decomposition methods used by x - ray observers to determine the mass flow @xmath4 may fail rather badly , particularly when the mass dropout decreases with radius in the flow . for this case </S>",
