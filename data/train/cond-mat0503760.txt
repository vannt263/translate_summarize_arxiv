    "growing networks is a vivid area of interdisciplinary sciences , with long list of applications @xcite .",
    "the mainstream of literature is concentrated on the structure of the networks . however , from the point of view of some applications it is of interest to decorate nodes with additional degrees of freedom . in the simplest case , these variables are discrete , with two possible values : @xmath8",
    ". such an extension can be useful when discussing numerous examples , from neural and logical networks through sexual networks to quantum gravitation @xcite .",
    "our topic here is a network of interacting magnetic moments ( spins ) , with two possible magnetic orientations , up or down .",
    "the models of spin networks with ferromagnetic interaction have been considered in several recent studies @xcite .",
    "the case of spin networks with antiferromagnetic interactions is essentially different because of the frustration effect along closed cycles on the graph @xcite .",
    "this difference is well known also for regular lattices @xcite .",
    "recently we introduced and investigated field - driven dynamics of spins on complex networks with the antiferromagnetic interaction @xcite .",
    "we found that the structural complexity of the networks leads to avalanches of spin flips and a criticality of the hysteresis loop .",
    "the desired shape of hysteresis curves can be obtained by tuning the clustering parameter @xmath4 . this parameter counts the number of links , which attach each new node to the growing network .    in this work we expand the study of the reversal processes in the antiferromagnetic spin networks .",
    "we demonstrate the genesis of avalanches due to inhomogeneity in network s connectivity when the clustering is low . in this limit",
    "the avalanche structure and duration can be clearly interpreted in terms of the theoretical distribution of connectivity and depth of the network . for large clustering , the character of the avalanche spectra @xmath0 for large @xmath1 change from mulitipeaky to a soft decreasing . for small avalanches , the avalanche spectra display the power - law character in the whole range of the clustering parameter @xmath4 .",
    "we define the size @xmath1 of avalanche as a number of spins which were flipped at a given value of external field @xmath9 .    in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we introduce details of the model and discuss spin reversal on small graphs .",
    "section [ sec3 ] contains details of the emergent structures for two classes of growing networks exponential and scale - free .",
    "our results on the magnetization reversal in these networks are given in section [ sec4 ] and discussed in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "to describe our procedure in details , we begin with small simple graphs ( fig .",
    "[ fig - net - his ] ) .",
    "a spin @xmath10 is placed at each node .",
    "if two nodes are linked together , antiferromagnetic interaction tends to keep them in one of two antiparallel configurations .",
    "energy of the whole system is written as @xmath11 where coupling constant @xmath12 for the antiferromagnetic interaction and the first summation goes over all nearest neighbor pairs @xmath13 .",
    "we assume symmetric neighbors , i.e. if spin @xmath14 is neighbor to spin @xmath15 then also @xmath15 is neighbor to @xmath14 .",
    "( we note , that results may be drastically different when the neighbor relations are directed @xcite . ) to draw the hysteresis loops , graphs are placed in saturating magnetic field @xmath16 , which forces all spins to be positive , i.e. to point upwards .",
    "we ramp the field @xmath9 by integer steps @xcite from @xmath17 to @xmath18 in order to avoid ambiguous spin orientation at integer field values @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "as the field decreases gradually at zero temperature @xmath21 some spins are flipped ( @xmath22 ) because of the antiferromagnetic interaction with their neighbors .       the same evaluation for exn , i.e. , @xmath23 for @xmath6 , and @xmath24 for @xmath25 from fig .",
    "[ fig - sn - h](a ) , when compared with @xmath0 gives a qualitative accordance . as a rule ,",
    "the size of maximal avalanches is comparable with the system size .",
    "this results suggests that the self - organized criticality ( soc ) might be a possible mechanism of the spin - reversal dynamics in the antiferromagnetic disorder - free networks .",
    "we note that for exn trees , the number of leaves of minimal degree @xmath26 can be evaluated from @xmath27 @xcite as @xmath28 for @xmath6 . for @xmath25 ,",
    "the distribution @xmath29 @xcite gives @xmath30 .",
    "comparison of the results for exn is included in third and fourth column of tab .",
    "these numbers prove , that in the hysteresis experiment , maximal avalanches for the descending field appear when @xmath31 .",
    "the spins flipping in these avalanches occupy the nodes with minimal degree @xmath4 .",
    "the observed quantitative differences might be attributed to the finite network sizes in the numerical calculations ; this produces deviations of simulation results from theoretical formula , which are exact in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "left parts of the histograms , i.e. the spectra for small avalanche sizes , are straight lines in the log - log scale .",
    "this means that @xmath2 , with @xmath3 close to @xmath32 for the exponential networks and @xmath3 slightly increasing with @xmath4 for the scale - free networks .",
    "it is not clear if this variation of @xmath3 for the scale - free networks is a consequence of a @xmath4-dependent finite size effect , or it means just a lack of universality .",
    "we can not verify it , because for large networks , the numerical algorithm becomes very time - consuming .",
    "however , this scaling behavior is valid only in the range of the avalanche size @xmath1 not much larger than one order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "the latter apply also to the distribution @xmath33 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - ndeltam ] ) . the effective exponents @xmath3 and",
    "@xmath34 are also shown in tab .",
    "spins which flip in this way are neither leaves ( for @xmath6 ) , nor `` leaves with two stems '' ( for @xmath25 ) , but they form `` central '' ( here the oldest ) parts of the networks .",
    "the results suggest that the spin flips in the better connected parts of the network form small avalanches with power - law distributions .    basing on these results we expect that avalanches and critical behavior may occur in various systems with broad connectivity distributions where some negative feedback exists between local degrees of freedom . in our spin - networks",
    "it is the antiferromagnetic character of interaction which causes this kind of feedback .",
    "more direct interpretation depends on particular systems . in particular , avalanches seem possible in complex magnetic systems as quantum magnetic cellular automata with magnetostatic interaction between particular monodomain elements @xcite .",
    "the size of avalanches is limited only by the size of the network .",
    "then , this kind of collective flipping is related to an instability of the system .",
    "design of an appropriate spatial structure , in particular by increasing clustering of the networks @xcite allows to tune and control the magnetization curve .",
    "concluding , our numerical results indicate that the positions of the largest peaks in the spectra of avalanches , which measure the size of the largest avalanches , agree well with the numbers of spins flipped at the field equal to the connectivity parameter @xmath4 .",
    "the latter can be interpreted as the numbers of nodes with minimal degree for networks with different topologies and connectivities .",
    "these results agree qualitatively with known theoretical formula for the degree distributions .",
