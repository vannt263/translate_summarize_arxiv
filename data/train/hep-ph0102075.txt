    "the phenomenological consequences of the cmssm have been studied extensively  @xcite , including the cosmological implications of its ( presumed stable ) lsp  @xcite . in such a regime",
    "the entire low energy phenomenology is specified by five parameters : a common gaugino mass @xmath4 , a common scalar mass @xmath5 , a common trilinear scalar a - term @xmath6 , the value of @xmath7 and the sign of the @xmath8-parameter in the scalar potential .",
    "these values are defined at some high energy scale , typically taken to be the scale of gauge coupling unification @xmath9 gev .    to obtain the superpartner spectrum at the electroweak scale the renormalization group equations ( rges )",
    "are run from the boundary scale to the electroweak scale  @xcite . in the following ,",
    "all gauge and yukawa couplings as well as a - terms were run with one loop rges while scalar masses and gaugino masses were run at two loops to capture the possible effects of heavy scalars and a heavy gluino on the evolution of third generation squarks and sleptons .",
    "we chose to keep only the top , bottom and tau yukawas and the corresponding a - terms .",
    "at the electroweak scale @xmath10 the one loop corrected effective potential @xmath11 is computed and the effective @xmath8-term @xmath12 is calculated @xmath13 in equation  ( [ eq : radmuterm ] ) the quantities @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the second derivatives of the radiative corrections @xmath16 with respect to the up - type and down - type higgs scalar fields , respectively .",
    "these corrections include the effects of all third generation particles .",
    "if the right hand side of equation  ( [ eq : radmuterm ] ) is positive then there exists some initial value of @xmath8 at the high energy scale which results in correct electroweak symmetry breaking with @xmath17  gev .",
    "the neutralino states and their masses are calculated using the neutralino mass matrix @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the mass of the hypercharge u(1 ) gaugino at the electroweak scale and @xmath20 is the mass of the su(2 ) gauginos at the electroweak scale .",
    "the matrix  ( [ neutmatrix ] ) is given in the @xmath21 basis , where @xmath22 represents the bino , @xmath23 represents the neutral wino and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the down - type and up - type higgsinos , respectively .",
    "the lightest eigenvalue of this matrix is then typically the lsp and it is overwhelmingly bino - like in content over most of the parameter space when @xmath7 is low .",
    "this is because the cmssm universality constraint on gaugino masses at the high scale of the theory implies @xmath26 when the masses are evolved to the electroweak scale via the rges .",
    "provided @xmath27 , which is the case for low @xmath7 , the lsp mass is then dominated by @xmath19 and has a typical bino content of @xmath28% .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to this low @xmath7 regime and adopt a value of @xmath29 for the remainder of the paper .",
    "the dark matter prospects of the high @xmath7 limit have been studied recently by feng et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "more generally the content of the lsp can be parametrized by writing the lightest neutralino as : @xmath30 which is normalized to @xmath31 .",
    "thus by saying that the bino content of the lightest neutralino is high , we mean @xmath32 .    given the particle spectrum we compute the thermal relic lsp density with a modified version of the software package _",
    "neutdriver _  @xcite .",
    "this program includes all of the annihilation processes computed by drees and nojiri  @xcite which are used to compute a thermally averaged cross section @xmath33 and freeze - out temperature @xmath34 . from knowledge of the mass of the lightest neutralino @xmath35 ( assumed to be the lsp ) , @xmath33 and @xmath36 ,",
    "a relic abundance can be computed using the standard approximation  @xcite @xmath37 where we have expressed the thermally averaged annihilation cross section as an expansion in powers of the relative velocity : @xmath38    a proper determination of relic lsp densities requires that the above computation be amended to include the possible effects of coannihilation  .",
    "this occurs when another particle is only slightly heavier than the lightest neutralino so that both particles freeze out of equilibrium at approximately the same temperature .",
    "the neutralino can now not only deplete its relic abundance through annihilation processes such as @xmath39 , but also through interactions with the coannihilator such as @xmath40 .",
    "the extreme importance of including relevant coannihilation channels has recently been emphasized for the case of the cmssm  @xcite , and in that spirit we have added a number of coannihilation channels which are relevant for both the universal gaugino mass case  @xcite as well as the case of nonuniversal gaugino masses to be considered in section  [ sec : general ] .    the program _ neutdriver _",
    "includes @xmath41 coannihilation to @xmath42  @xcite and two ( massless ) fermions @xmath43 which we recalculated to account for non - zero fermion masses .",
    "we have also included a calculation of the process @xmath44 , and found this channel to often dominate when kinematically accessible .",
    "additionally , we have inserted the results of  @xcite for @xmath45 coannihilation to @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 final states .",
    "the region of cmssm parameter space that gives rise to acceptable levels of bino - like lsp relic density is given in figure  [ fig : efoplot ] where we have plotted contours of @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 . here",
    "@xmath53 is the fractional lsp matter density relative to the critical density and @xmath54 is the reduced hubble parameter : @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "we have chosen @xmath4 and @xmath5 as free parameters in the manner of ellis , falk & olive  @xcite with @xmath56 , @xmath57 and positive @xmath8-term . least constrained by the measurement of the branching ratio for @xmath58 events .",
    "this is the opposite convention used by the _",
    "neutdriver _ package .",
    "]    this plot is similar to the ones presented in  @xcite and we reproduce it here to draw attention to two important facts .",
    "first , observations suggest that the preferred values for cold dark matter densities are in the range @xmath59  @xcite , though including the latest evidence of a cosmological constant  @xcite may shift this to @xmath60 .",
    "this experimental data points to a region of the cmssm parameter space in which both the universal scalar mass and the universal gaugino mass are small , on the order of @xmath61 gev for each ( see , for example , the region around point a in figure  [ fig : efoplot ] ) .",
    "in fact , heavy scalars can only be accommodated cosmologically if nature was kind enough to arrange the soft - supersymmetry breaking parameters so that the mass of the lsp is about half of the mass of the lightest higgs boson . in that case , though t - channel scalar fermion exchange may be suppressed and the annihilation rate into two fermions is not sufficient to deplete the lsp density adequately , the annihilation through resonant s - channel exchange of the lightest higgs is efficient enough to provide an acceptable dark matter region insensitive to the scalar mass .",
    "we have allowed our @xmath5 value to range to as much as a tev , in contrast to  @xcite , to accentuate the point that most of the cmssm parameter space considered `` natural '' in the literature predicts far _ too much _ neutralino relic density .",
    "every point in figure  [ fig : efoplot ] above the @xmath62 line is already excluded by astrophysical measurements of the dark matter density .",
    "this rules out almost all of the plotted parameter space except for the low - mass region including point a and the thin strip right above the region excluded due to a charged lsp ( the region including point b ) .",
    "once we begin to impose constraints arising from higgs searches at lep , the preferred low mass region in figure  [ fig : efoplot ] begins to be ruled out .",
    "the only region which then remains in the @xmath63 plane for @xmath29 is that which is due to coannihilation between the lsp and the lightest stau .",
    "being in this region requires a very specific relationship between the gaugino mass parameter and the unrelated scalar mass parameter .",
    "to better illustrate the physics behind figure  [ fig : efoplot ] and to serve as a comparison for our subsequent analysis we have chosen four representative points from the parameter space for deeper investigation . both points a and b fall within the cosmologically preferred region .",
    "point b is in the coannihilation tail,",
    "so we would expect most of the annihilation cross section to come from coannihilation .",
    "as we can see in figure  [ fig : dsigmas ] the annihilation cross section of point b is indeed dominated by coannihilation .",
    "we can also see the importance of t - channel sfermion exchange to @xmath64 in points a and b , which is due to the universal scalar mass being relatively light so that this channel is open . referring back to figure  [ fig : efoplot ] , both points c and d are in regions where there is too much relic density . figure  [ fig : dsigmas ] shows that , indeed , the annihilation is too inefficient to eliminate enough dark matter .",
    "the annihilation channels to two fermions still dominate but now sfermion exchange is too suppressed to provide the critical annihilation rate ( indicated by the dashed line ) . as with points c and d , most of the parameter space of the cmssm is experimentally excluded since there is no efficient way of depleting the relic density .    it is a generic result of the low @xmath7 cmssm scenario that , excluding stau coannihilation , cosmological viability depends almost solely on the t - channel exchange of sfermions .",
    "this strict dependence causes most of the presumed parameter space to be experimentally excluded , leaving the dark matter prospects of the cmssm in serious jeopardy .",
    "the reason for the failure of the low @xmath7 cmssm to solve the dark matter problem is the low annihilation cross section for the neutralino .",
    "the only channel capable of providing a suitable cross section is the aforementioned t - channel sfermion exchange which is only efficient in a small region of parameter space .",
    "if we relax the gut relationship between the gaugino masses but still remain in the large @xmath65 limit ( low @xmath7 ) then we will continue to have a predominantly _ gaugino - like _ lsp ( @xmath66 ) with the relative values of @xmath67 and @xmath68 governed by the relative values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "decreasing @xmath20 relative to @xmath19 at the electroweak scale increases the wino content of the lsp until ultimately @xmath69 and @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "the bino component of the neutralino couples with a u(1 ) gauge strength whereas the wino component couples with the larger su(2 ) gauge strength , thus enhancing its annihilation cross section and thereby lowering its relic density . as @xmath68",
    "is increased more parameter space should open up for dark matter until annihilation becomes too efficient in the pure wino - like limit and we are left with no neutralino dark matter at all  @xcite .",
    "this is evident in figure  [ fig : e4plot ] where we plot contours of @xmath72 as a function of scalar mass and the ratio @xmath73 at the boundary condition scale @xmath74 .",
    "allowing the gaugino masses to vary independently introduces two new degrees of freedom .",
    "we have chosen to vary the ratio @xmath73 while fixing the value of @xmath75 and @xmath76 at the high scale . in practice",
    "we use our choice of @xmath4 to determine the value of the smaller of the pair @xmath77 at the high scale and then use the ratio @xmath73 to determine the larger of @xmath77 . in figure",
    "[ fig : e4plot ] we have set @xmath78 gev and @xmath79 .",
    "particular values of @xmath73 which deviate from the universal cmssm case allow for cosmologically interesting relic densities which are almost independent of the scalar mass . to see how dark matter physics changes as one departs from the cmssm we have analyzed the six labelled points from figure  [ fig : e4plot ] in figure  [ fig : esigmas ] .",
    "starting with the two cmssm points , e and f , the importance of the process @xmath80 is again demonstrated .",
    "point f has scalars that are too heavy for the two fermion final state to sufficently deplete the lsp relic density while point e has much lighter scalars , allowing efficient annihilation to two fermions and resulting in an appropriate amount of dark matter . given the value of @xmath78 gev for this plot point",
    "e would lie a little to the left of point a in figure  [ fig : efoplot ] .",
    "points c and d sit at much lower values of @xmath73 , resulting in a lightest chargino that is much more degenerate with the lightest neutralino .",
    "this enhances the importance of coannihilation channels , leading them to dominate the annihilation cross section .",
    "the main channels for coannihilation are @xmath81 , making up the left - hand coannihilation column in figure  [ fig : esigmas ] , and @xmath82 , which is the main contributor to the right - hand coannihilation column .",
    "chargino - neutralino coannihilation has become so efficient here that the relic density is now not enough to account for observations .",
    "it should be noted that point d gives almost the cosmologically preferred relic density  its relic density is higher than that of point c for two reasons .",
    "first , the mass of the lightest neutralino drops slightly in going from point d ( @xmath83 gev ) to point c ( @xmath84 gev ) .",
    "second , the lower scalar mass at point c allows t - channel exchange of scalar fermions to go unsuppressed .",
    "this is important in one of the diagrams contributing to @xmath85 .",
    "the wino content of the lightest neutralino is also increased by lowering @xmath73 , causing the standard annihilation channel to two fermions to become relatively unimportant .",
    "this increase in efficiency continues through points a and b , now making the neutralino relic density cosmologically irrelevant .",
    "the irrelevance of scalar masses above @xmath86 tev can be simply understood . above @xmath86",
    "tev the t - channel scalar exchange contribution to @xmath80 is suppressed due to the scalar mass . with enhanced wino content , however , channels that were previously suppressed are now more efficient , such as @xmath87 .",
    "more importantly , we can also see from figure  [ fig : e4plot ] that much of the parameter space in the @xmath88 plane is not ruled out : an @xmath89 is not experimentally excluded , it just does not completely explain all of the needed dark matter .",

    "[ fig : eplots1 ] and subsequent plots we impose the constraint that the lsp be electrically neutral and that the resulting spectrum at the electroweak scale satisfies the search limits of table  [ tbl : massbounds ] .",
    "the shaded region in panel ( a ) of figure  [ fig : eplots1 ] is excluded by the gluino mass bound while the shaded region in panels ( c ) and ( d ) are excluded by the constraint on the stau mass . as the value of the gluino mass @xmath76 is increased relative to the other gaugino masses the cosmologically preferred range of the ratio @xmath73 moves to slightly higher values .",
    "it is apparent from figure  [ fig : eplot5 ] that the crucial variable in the determination of the lsp relic density is the value of the ratio @xmath73 at the electroweak scale .",
    "the region of preferred relic density @xmath106 consistently asymptotes to the region between the values @xmath107 and @xmath108 independent of the value of @xmath76 , with the influence of the universal scalar mass @xmath109 most pronounced for small values of @xmath76 .",
    "most of the reason for this behavior is the composition of the low - scale squark masses . for large values of @xmath76 the rg evolution of the squark masses",
    "is dominated by @xmath76 which drives scalar masses to higher values and further suppresses the t - channel slepton and squark exchange diagrams .",
    "this causes the asymptotic approach to scalar - mass - independence to saturate for much lower values of @xmath109 than in the low @xmath76 case , where the value of squark and slepton masses is largely independent of @xmath76 and merely a function of the boundary value @xmath109 at the high scale .",
    "these results are robust under changes in the relative sign between the soft supersymmetry - breaking values of @xmath110 and @xmath76 , as well as changes in the overall gaugino mass scale @xmath4 , as is demonstrated in figure  [ fig : flipm3 ] .   and",
    "@xmath20 see  @xcite .",
    "] for low values of @xmath76 there is little difference between the positive and negative values , though for high values of @xmath76 the entire plot moves from right to left when the sign is reversed .",
    "nonetheless , the cosmologically preferred region falls between the same values of @xmath111 ( denoted by dashed lines ) , regardless of the sign of @xmath76 : it is only the preferred region of @xmath112 that changes with the sign flip .",
    "both the effects of the magnitude of @xmath76 as well as its relative sign can be understood from the effect @xmath76 has on the running of @xmath20 and @xmath19 , starting at two loops .",
    "the two loop running of the gaugino masses , in the conventions of  @xcite , is partially given by @xmath113 where @xmath114 is a matrix of positive entries . therefore the higher the value of @xmath115 the greater the impact on the gaugino masses @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , this effect is felt more strongly by the su(2 ) gaugino mass than the u(1 ) gaugino mass .",
    "thus for a given value of @xmath112 changing the sign of @xmath76 drives the value of @xmath20 higher at the electroweak scale to a greater degree than it does @xmath19 , resulting in a higher value of @xmath111 .",
    "this in turn leads to an increased relic density as can be seen by comparing the right and left sets of panels in figure  [ fig : flipm3 ] .",
    "we have seen that relaxing the gut constraint on the gaugino masses allows for significant improvement in the dark matter arena .",
    "this relaxation only requires a slight increase in the wino content of the lsp on the order of 0.1 to 5% ( see figure  [ fig : eplots1 ] ) : the lsp is still predominantly bino - like and is not in the unappealling wino - dominated scenario which must rely on other mechanisms to generate supersymmetric dark matter  @xcite .",
    "the observations made in this section indicate that models which allow control over @xmath73 at the boundary scale may be more suitable to providing supersymmetric dark matter than the unified cmssm paradigm .",
    "in fact , requiring a cosmologically relevant relic lsp density may in turn shed light on the nature of physics at the gut scale in models of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "we will carry out an example of just such an investigation in the next section on a class of supergravity models derived from heterotic string theory .",
    "in this section we turn our attention to a class of heterotic string - derived supergravity theories that invoke gaugino condensation in a hidden sector to break supersymmetry .",
    "the framework for this model was first put forward by bintruy , gaillard and wu  @xcite and its phenomenology was considered in subsequent papers  @xcite . as a supergravity model with a unification scale , many of the typical results of msugra continue to hold  in particular the few number of parameters necessary to determine the low - energy spectrum",
    ". however , a newly - emphasized contribution to the gaugino masses resulting from the superconformal anomaly  @xcite gives a correction to the standard gaugino mass unification that has been investigated recently  @xcite .",
    "thus in this model one is able to determine the ratio @xmath73 as a function of the parameters of the hidden sector .",
    "the soft supersymmetry - breaking gaugino masses @xmath116 in the bgw model are determined at the scale of gaugino condensation ( typically of order @xmath117 gev ) .",
    "they are proportional to the gravitino mass @xmath118 and depend on the value of the beta - function coefficient of the condensing gauge group(s ) of the hidden sector . in practice",
    "the soft supersymmetry - breaking terms are dominated by the condensing group with the largest beta - function coefficient , which we label @xmath119 : @xmath120 with @xmath121 here @xmath122 and @xmath123 are the quadratic casimirs of the adjoint and matter representations @xmath124 , respectively , under the largest condensing gauge group . in equation  ( [ eq : gaugmass ] ) @xmath125 is the dilaton field whose vacuum expectation value determines the string coupling constant at the string scale : @xmath126 .",
    "here we have assumed the standard string coupling suggested by gut scale unification : @xmath127 . finally , the constants @xmath128 and @xmath129 in  ( [ eq : gaugmass ] ) depend on the group theory parameters of the observable sector gauge groups . for example the su(2 )",
    "gaugino mass depends on the constants : @xmath130 with similar definitions for the su(3 ) and u(1 ) gaugino masses .",
    "thus the key variable @xmath73 depends on the value of @xmath119 : @xmath131    figure  [ fig : c2plot1 ] shows contours of constant lsp relic density for the bgw model in the @xmath132 plane , where @xmath109 is the usual universal scalar mass whose value is given by @xmath133 in the model we will consider here .",
    "while the axes of figure  [ fig : c2plot1 ] are very similar to those of figures  [ fig : e4plot ] ,  [ fig : eplots1 ] and  [ fig : eplot5 ] there are some notable differences in the bgw model .",
    "the gluino mass parameter @xmath76 relates to @xmath20 and @xmath19 through an identical relationship to equation ( [ eq : bgwratio ] ) and therefore changes with @xmath119 . in the previous figures @xmath76",
    "was held constant at the high scale within a single plot , but in figure  [ fig : c2plot1 ] the ratio @xmath134 at the condensation scale varies from 0.2 at @xmath135 to 0.8 at @xmath136 .",
    "nevertheless , there is still a region of viable dark matter largely independent of the universal scalar mass , as in the general nonuniversal cases studied in section  [ sec : general ] , for the same reasons : a smaller value of @xmath73 for lower @xmath119 results in higher wino content as well as more degeneracy between the lightest neutralino and chargino , resulting in conannihilation .    in the left plot of figure  [ fig : c2plot1 ]",
    "it is evident that this is not a result of the masses being tuned to sit on a pole .",
    "the higgs pole , given by the locus of points for which @xmath137 , is indicated by the uppermost dotted line .",
    "more important is the @xmath138-pole , denoted by the second lower dotted line in the left plot , where a neutralino and chargino go to an on - shell @xmath138-boson , severely warping the lower part of the plot .",
    "however , both of these resonant regions are excluded experimentally by the criteria of table  [ tbl : massbounds ] as indicated in the right plot of figure  [ fig : c2plot1 ] by the shaded region .",
    "the key constraints include the gluino mass ( given by the dashed line ) and the chargino mass ( given by two parallel solid curves representing a chargino mass of 75 and 90 gev from bottom to top ) .    as with the previous cases the additonal physics contained in this plot is easily seen through a few representative points given in more detail in figure  [ fig : c2sigmas ] .",
    "starting from the top right in figure  [ fig : c2plot1 ] , point f sits at far too high a value of @xmath109 for the normal cmssm annihilation channels to be effective .",
    "its high value of @xmath119 also gives a high value of @xmath111 ( between 1.3 and 1.4 ) , so the wino content of the lsp is low .",
    "the dominant channels are neutralino - chargino coannihilation but this is not sufficient to deplete the relic density to acceptable levels .",
    "point e lies exactly on the pole for two neutralinos going to an on - shell higgs which then naturally decays to two fermions , making this the dominant final state .",
    "a lowered sfermion mass scale also allows coannihilation to two fermions to increase .",
    "nevertheless , the net effect is still too small to bring the relic density down far enough .",
    "point d is in the region where one would not expect much annihilation to fermions , but for this @xmath119 value the neutralino and chargino are becoming more degenerate , increasing coannihilation and bringing the relic density down towards the cosmologically preferred region .",
    "additionally , points d and f are the only two points which kinematically allow @xmath139 .",
    "once this channel is open it is the main determining factor in the relic density .",
    "points b and c both lie near the region where the masses of the lightest chargino and the lsp add up to exactly the mass of the charged @xmath138-boson .",
    "this enhances the efficiency of most channels of chargino - neutralino coannihilation , resulting in a relic density that is now a little too low to account for astrophysical observations . for point a , by contrast , the particles are off - shell so these processes are too inefficient and the relic density is too high .",
    "note that for points a , b and c the value of the lightest chargino mass is below the experimental limit so these points are excluded .",
    "figure  [ fig : c2plot2 ] shows how the parameters of the bgw model determine wino content and the ratio @xmath111 . as in the case of figures  [ fig : eplots1 ] and",

    "the shaded region between these curves can then be thought of as the phenomenologically preferred region of hidden sector configuration space .    upon @xmath174 orbifold compactification of the heterotic string",
    "the @xmath175 gauge group of the hidden sector is presumed to break to some subgroup(s ) of @xmath175 . for each such subgroup the equations in  ( [ eq : coeff ] ) define a line in the @xmath176 plane which we have displayed in figure  [ fig : c1plot ] .",
    "we then sampled 25,000 combinations of @xmath177 which give rise to gravitino masses between 100 gev and 10 tev and which yield a particle spectrum consistent with the bounds in table  [ tbl : massbounds ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : c1plot ] we display those combinations which implied a relic density in the range @xmath59 ( fine points ) , as well as the slightly higher range @xmath178 ( coarse points ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : c1plot ] clearly favors a very specific region of hidden sector parameter space with a preferred value of @xmath119 in the neighborhood of @xmath179 and a corresponding range in @xmath180 of @xmath181 , which points towards a large condensing group such as @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 or @xmath186 .",
    "a typical matter configuration for the hidden sector would be represented in figure  [ fig : c1plot ] by a point on one of the gauge group lines .",
    "the number of possible configurations consistent with a given choice of @xmath187 and supersymmetry - breaking scale @xmath118 is quite restricted .",
    "for example , if we ask for a hidden sector configuration charged under the @xmath185 gauge group for which @xmath188 and @xmath189 , and require that our matter condensates be gauge invariant so that fundamentals must come in groups of three , then from  ( [ eq : coeff ] ) the only combination that falls in the preferred region of figure  [ fig : c1plot ] is @xmath190 .",
    "this combination is notable in that it was shown in  @xcite to possess many desirable phenomenological features .",
    "a similar analysis for the other allowed gauge groups leaves only a handful of possible hidden sector configurations , summarized in table  [ tbl : gaugegroups ] , where we have included some examples with various hidden sector effective yukawa couplings @xmath168 and the implied values of @xmath118 and @xmath191 .",
    "as is evident from the table and from figure  [ fig : c1plot ] , using the dark matter constraint on lsp relic densities is a very powerful tool in restricting the high energy physics of the underlying theory .",

    "this is due to the inefficient annihilation of a dominantly bino - like lsp .",
    "departure from the standard cmssm gut relation allows values of @xmath73 that accomodate small admixtures of wino content for the lsp . lowering this ratio at the electroweak scale increases the lsp annihilation efficiency by virtue of its higher wino content and the tightening degeneracy between the lightest chargino and the lsp , resulting in increased coannihilation .",

    "tev  quite in contrast to the very light scalars required in the standard cmssm case .",
    "the requirement of cosmologically interesting relic densities , or at least the demand that @xmath224 , can be a powerful constraint on models with nonuniversal gaugino masses which is often quite complementary to the constraints arising from direct search limits for superpartners .",

    "similar analyses on models with small deviations from universality should prove equally fruitful . while relic densities of supersymmetric particles that were once in thermal equilibrium need not be the explanation for the missing nonbaryonic mass in the universe , it is nevertheless one of the most compelling aspects of low - energy supersymmetric phenomenology and promises to remain so even in scenarios with heavy squarks and sleptons .",
