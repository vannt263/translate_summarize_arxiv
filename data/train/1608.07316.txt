    "quantum interference with entangled - photon states is a major tool in quantum information processing , communication , and quantum metrology , dating to the early days of quantum optics @xcite .",
    "polarization entanglement is a common method for encoding qubits and for quantum information processing @xcite , while spectral entanglement is at the heart of the dispersion cancellation effect used in quantum measurement schemes @xcite .",
    "the simultaneous entanglement of multiple variables is often called hyper - entanglement @xcite .",
    "frequency - polarization hyper - entanglement gave rise to a special type of quantum interferometer @xcite used in quantum metrology for super - resolution sensors to measure polarization - dependent optical delays@xcite .",
    "the central element of any high - resolution quantum interference measurement device is an ultra - broadband source of polarization and frequency entangled photon pairs .",
    "the process of type - ii spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) in nonlinear crystals is a preferred source of hyper - entangled states  @xcite , but unfortunately , the natural spectral bandwidth of emitted pairs in type - ii interaction is rather narrow .",
    "the bandwidth is always smaller than that of type - i spdc because the different dispersive properties of orthogonally - polarized down - converted photons tighten the requirements for phase matching .",
    "early demonstrations of broadband type - ii sources simply used very thin ( 50 - 100 microns ) non - linear crystals , taking advantage of the fact that the phase - matching bandwidth in the nonlinear medium is inversely proportional to the interaction length @xcite .",
    "however , the resulting small interaction volume inevitably lead to a very low quantum state production rate , limiting its practicality .    the majority of recent entangled - photon source implementations use quasi - phase - matched ( qpm ) nonlinear crystals in order to avoid cumbersome arrangements in bulk crystal .",
    "the ideology of quasi - phase - matching proposed in the early days of nonlinear optics @xcite blossomed into a mainstream technology @xcite .",
    "it enables researchers to achieve high - quality phase matching without need for rotating the bulk nonlinear crystal searching for the correct angle .",
    "quasi - phase - matching enables effective nonlinear conversion over much longer interaction regions when compared with bulk crystal phase matching , helping achieve significantly higher production rates of entangled photon pairs .",
    "however , the increase in the nonlinear interaction length also narrows the down conversion spectral bandwidth .",
    "the technique of chirping ( changing the periodicity of the modulation pattern ) is a tool that can broaden the nonlinear conversion spectrum .",
    "chirping has been successfully implemented in conventional broadband parametric amplifiers and converters .",
    "one known problem is that linear chirping of periodic structure in nonlinear crystals inevitably deforms the initial @xmath6 spectral phase matching profile @xcite and reduces parametric amplification of gaussian signals .",
    "a special process of chirping pattern apodization was introduced with the goal of smoothing the spectral intensity profile in parametric amplifiers @xcite leading to a quasi - gaussian spectral intensity envelope .",
    "the production of significantly broadband ( @xmath7100 nm wide ) and simultaneously high quality hyper - entangled photon states for quantum interferometry is a more demanding task .",
    "in addition to the broad and smooth spectral intensity profile of the source , quantum interferometry relies on the purity of the generated spectral entanglement .",
    "it is known from the early days of quantum optics that the quality of quantum interference depends on complete indistinguishability of contributions from photons produced in different parts of the nonlinear interaction region , and on the stable phase relationship between all conjugated signal and idler spectral components @xcite .",
    "the effect of indistinguishability can be described using a spectral amplitude and phase distribution in the output signal . a convenient way to model",
    "the spdc in a qpm structure is to consider a sequence of coherently pumped conversion processes in each nonlinear domain .",
    "the photons generated in different domains interfere at the output of the crystal and produce the final broadband spectrum .",
    "the timing of each photon s arrival at the surface of detectors in quantum interferometry is defined by the location of its origin inside the nonlinear source . in the standard case of a coherent pump and _ uniform _ poling period",
    "the difference in arrival of two photons is a linear function of this location and is directly connected with the differential group velocity delay accumulated inside the source .",
    "one polarization emerges ahead of the other because of birefringence .",
    "this constant phase dependance , together with a symmetric spectral intensity distribution , opens up a means to compensate for the increased distinguishability due to difference in the arrival time .",
    "compensation is achieved by using a linear external polarization delay @xcite in order to reinstate indistinguishability of contributions from orthogonally - polarized photon pairs generated in the front and in the back portion of the crystal .",
    "the situation changes in the case of a strongly chirped qpm crystal .",
    "the chirp - induced distortion of timing between photons generated in different regions of the nonlinear material becomes so significant that it strongly deforms the interference pattern by creating beating - type modulations .",
    "the reduced visibility of the quantum interference pattern and its deformed shape are caused by the spectral intensity modulation and by the asymmetry of higher - order phase derivatives in the spectral profile of the down converted radiation .",
    "this detrimental phase - distortion effect must be mitigated in order to restore high - quality quantum interference and to build quantum interferometric sensors capable of resolving sub - femtosecond time delays @xcite .",
    "this paper demonstrates that a special poling profile that is asymmetric in regards to the center of the physical sample in a strongly - chirped quasi - phase - matched nonlinear crystal can remedy this complex problem , enlarging the entangled photon source bandwidth while simultaneously achieving high visibility in a quantum interferometer .",
    "the main novel feature is that the symmetrization and establishment of indistinguishability between signal and idler spectral contributions occurs in the _ phase - amplitude parameter space _ instead of traditional spatial symmetrization procedure .",
    "the positive effect of the proposed symmetrization in phase - amplitude space is illustrated by numerical simulation of coincidence interferometry outcomes using quantum states produced with nonlinearly - chirped poling patterns imposed on titanium diffused lithium niobate waveguides ( ti : ppln ) .",
    "the diffusion of titanium creates waveguides in lithium niobate that are capable of supporting type - ii nonlinear interactions , in contrast to proton - exchange embedded ppln waveguides that can support only one polarization mode .",
    "we consider a nonlinear optical process of type - ii spdc pumped with a monochromatic , plane - wave laser of angular frequency @xmath8 in a ti - diffused waveguide in lithium niobate with a custom periodic poling pattern ( see fig .",
    "[ ppln ] ) .        using the well - established general theoretical description @xcite ,",
    "the two - photon portion of the outgoing state can be expressed ( up to overall constants ) as    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the two - photon amplitude of type - ii spdc as a function of signal frequency ,  @xmath11 , and idler frequency ,  ( @xmath12 ) , and the sinc function is defined by @xmath13 . here",

    "the subscripts @xmath19 and @xmath20 indicate horizontal and vertical polarizations respectively , and we have arbitrarily identified the horizontal polarization with the signal .",
    "the summation in equation ( 2 ) represents a coherent superposition of contributions occurring in individual domains .",
    "the phase accumulated by passive linear propagation of photons created in each domain is shown as the summation in the exponent .",
    "note that this model is capable of describing arbitrary complex poling profiles since there is no restriction on the length of each domain .",
    "the total length of the waveguide ( or periodically poled interaction region ) is @xmath21 .",
    "the state @xmath22 produced by collinear type - ii interaction in the waveguide is introduced into a two - photon correlation interferometer ( fig .  [ setup ] ) .",
    "the polarization entangled state , @xmath23 , is post - selected by recording only coincidence counts between two single - photon detectors @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the polarization interferometer consists of a non - polarizing beam splitter  ( npbs ) and a diagonally - oriented polarizer in each output arm of the beam splitter .",
    "additionally a birefringent delay line  ( bdl ) made of two crystal quartz prisms to provide variable thickness is placed in the output arm of the npbs leading to detector @xmath25 . after projecting incoming photons onto a diagonal polarization basis using polarizers in both arms , we record coincidence counts using @xmath24 , @xmath25 and a time interval analyzer .    in the case of a monochromatic pump with angular frequency @xmath8 , the signal  ( @xmath26 ) and idler ( @xmath27 ) frequencies are anti - correlated .",
    "combined with energy conservation , ( @xmath28 ) , this allows us to write the signal and idler frequencies in terms of a detuning frequency @xmath29 , @xmath30 where @xmath31 . note that @xmath32 may be either positive or negative ,",

    "the two terms in the integrand represent the two amplitudes that contribute to coincidence counts    ( i )  a horizontally - polarized signal photon at frequency @xmath39 reaching d1 along with a vertical idler photon at @xmath40 reaching d2 , or ( ii ) a vertical idler at @xmath40 reaching d1 along with a horizontal signal at @xmath39 reaching d2 . in each case",
