    "during the last year , type 0 string theories@xcite , which are superstring theories without spacetime supersymmetry , have attracted much attention .",
    "they allow us the possibility to analyze non - supersymmetric qcd by means of the brane techniques developed for supersymmetric theories@xcite . however , the properties of type 0 theories are not as well known as other supersymmetric string theories , because bps conditions , which provide a great deal of information concerning supersymmetric theories , are not available .",
    "recently , bergman and gaberdiel found a duality between type 0 and type ii theories@xcite . with this duality",
    ", it may become possible to obtain new properties of type 0 theories from knowledge of type ii theories .",
    "therefore , it is important to investigate this duality . the purpose of this paper is to find the duality relations between brane configurations in type 0 theories and those in type ii theories .",
    "as is mentioned in @xcite , type ii theory compactified on @xmath0 with monodromy @xmath1 is t - dual to type 0 theory on @xmath0 with monodromy @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are operators that count spacetime fermions and right - moving worldsheet fermions , respectively . in ref.@xcite",
    ", these compactifications are represented as compactifications on @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 is generated by an operator @xmath7 or @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a half shift of @xmath0 .",
    "these two expressions are the same , except that the definitions of the radius of @xmath0 are different by a factor @xmath10 .",
    "( precisely , duals of type iia and type iib are type 0b and type 0a , respectively .",
    "we omit the letters a and b in what follows . ) instead of explicitly showing the equivalence of these two theories in terms of the world sheet cft , we only give the spectra of these theories in table [ typeii.tbl ] and table [ type0.tbl ] . in these tables , @xmath11 and @xmath12 represent the wrapping number and the kaluza - klein momentum along the compactified direction .",
    ".spectrum of type ii theory on @xmath0 with monodromy @xmath13 .",
    "the upper ( lower ) signs in the complex signs correspond to type iib ( iia ) theory .",
    "the variables @xmath11 and @xmath12 represent the wrapping number and the kaluza - klein momentum along the compactified direction . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     indeed , according to the results given in these tables , we find that these two spectra are identical if we swap the wrapping number and the kaluza - klein momentum",
    ". in particular , a type ii ( type 0 ) closed string with wrapping number @xmath14 corresponds to a type 0 ( type ii ) kaluza - klein mode with momentum @xmath15 .",
    "this implies the relations @xmath16 where @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) are the string tension and the compactification radius in type ii ( type 0 ) theory .",
    "using these two equations , we obtain @xmath21 and @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the string length scale defined with the common string tension by @xmath24 . the relation ( [ rr ] ) is different from that in usual type ii / type ii t - duality by the factor @xmath25 on the right - hand side .",
    "this is the same as in the case of heterotic / heterotic t - duality where , for example , an @xmath26 heterotic string with wrapping number @xmath14 is dual to a kaluza - klein mode with momentum @xmath15 in the @xmath27 representation of unbroken @xmath28 .    concerning the string coupling constants @xmath29 and @xmath30",
    ", we can obtain the following relation by requiring the nine - dimensional newton s constants of the two theories to agree : @xmath31",
    "similarly to the type ii / type ii t - duality , under the type 0/type ii t - duality , wrapped d - branes and unwrapped d - branes are transformed into unwrapped d - branes and wrapped d - branes , respectively . however , the situation is more complicated and interesting .",
    "it is known that the tensions of type 0 d - branes are @xmath32 times those of type ii d - branes@xcite .",
    "namely , with the string coupling constant and the string length scale , the tensions of d - branes are represented as @xmath33 using ( [ rr ] ) , ( [ gg ] ) and ( [ tensions ] ) , we can obtain @xmath34 this equation implies that an unwrapped type ii d - brane is transformed into a wrapped d - brane with wrapping number @xmath10 by the duality . at first sight , this seems strange because it seems that we can decompose the type 0 d - brane into two wrapped d - branes with wrapping number @xmath14 .",
    "this is , however , impossible on the type ii side .",
    "this is interpreted as follows . in the type 0 theory , by the monodromy @xmath35 around @xmath0 , the two r - r fields @xmath36 and @xmath37 are transformed into @xmath36 and @xmath38 , respectively . ( the fields @xmath36 and @xmath37 are massless fields in the ( r@xmath39,r@xmath40 ) and ( r@xmath41,r@xmath42 ) sectors , respectively . ) in terms of the d - brane charge , this implies that when an electric ( magnetic ) d - brane goes around @xmath0 , it is changed into a magnetic ( electric ) d - brane .",
    "( we call d - branes ` electric ' when the signs of two r - r charges are the same and ` magnetic ' when they are opposite , although , except for d3-branes , these are not electric nor magnetic in the usual meanings . ) therefore , if the wrapping number of a d - brane is @xmath14 , it can not be closed . to connect two endpoints of a wrapped d - brane",
    ", the wrapping number should be even .",
    "this is the reason that a type 0 d - brane with wrapping number @xmath10 , which is dual to the single type ii d - brane , can not be decomposed ( figure [ dual.eps ] ) .    on a stack of @xmath43 type ii d - branes , there exist @xmath44 gauge bosons and adjoint fermions , and they make a vector multiplet of ten - dimensional @xmath45 supersymmetry . following the argument above , the type 0 dual of this brane configuration is a stack of @xmath43 electric and @xmath43 magnetic type 0 d - branes .",
    "the field theory on the type 0 brane configuration is known to be @xmath46 yang - mills theory with fermions belonging to the bi - fundamental representation@xcite .",
    "however , now , because the electric d - branes and the magnetic d - branes are connected , the gauge group is broken to the diagonal @xmath44 . as a result ,",
    "all massless fields on d - branes belong to the adjoint representation of this @xmath44 , and the massless spectrum agrees with that on type ii d - branes .",
    "next , let us consider the duality between wrapped type ii d - branes and unwrapped type 0 d - branes . using ( [ rr ] ) , ( [ gg ] ) and ( [ tensions ] ) we obtain @xmath47 this equation implies that the dual of a wrapped type ii d(@xmath48)-brane is an unwrapped type 0 d@xmath49-brane .",
    "is it electric or magnetic ?",
    "we should remember the fact that because of the existence of the monodromy @xmath35 , we can not globally define ` electric ' and ` magnetic ' d - branes .",
    "therefore , we can freely call a certain d - brane electric or magnetic",
    ". however , it makes sense to say that two d - branes are of the same type or not . if two type 0 d - branes are of different types , where does the difference come from on the type ii side ? to obtain an answer to this question ,",
    "let us consider an electric type 0 unwrapped d - brane .",
    "it is dual to a type ii wrapped d - brane . on the type 0 side",
    ", we can change the d - brane to a magnetic one by moving it around @xmath0 . on the type ii side , this corresponds to a change of the wilson line @xmath50 . in the case of type ii / type ii duality , to move an unwrapped d - brane round @xmath0 corresponds to a change of the wilson line @xmath51 .",
    "now , however , the size of @xmath0 of type 0 theory is @xmath52 , unlike @xmath53 in type ii / type ii duality , and this implies that the change of the wilson line should also be halved .",
    "namely , the change should be @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that electric and magnetic unwrapped type 0 d - branes correspond to wrapped type ii d - branes with wilson lines @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively ( fig.[dual2.eps ] ) .",
    "we can show that the massless spectra on these type 0 and type ii d - branes agree .",
    "let us consider a stack of @xmath57 electric and @xmath58 magnetic unwrapped type 0 d - branes .",
    "the massless fields on this stack are @xmath59 gauge fields and fermions in the @xmath60 and @xmath61 representations .",
    "the dual brane configuration is a stack of @xmath62 type ii d - branes with the wilson line @xmath63 , where @xmath55 is a phase factor which does not affect the spectrum . with the wilson line , the gauge group @xmath64 is broken to @xmath59 .",
    "fermions in the adjoint representation are decomposed into @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "in addition to the wilson line acting on these four representations as @xmath67 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath68 , we should take account of the monodromy @xmath1 , which reverses the sign of wave functions of all the fermion fields . as a result",
    ", fermions in @xmath60 and @xmath61 remain massless .",
    "this is consistent with the type 0 spectrum .",
    "as d - branes , ns5-branes play important roles in brane constructions of yang - mills theories@xcite , and they are important to establish the duality relations of ns5-branes . in this section ,",
    "we give the duals of type 0 and type ii ns5-branes .",
    "regardless of the type of string theory in question , we can obtain the tensions of ns5-branes by using the dirac quantization condition as follows : @xmath69 from ( [ gg ] ) and ( [ ns5s ] ) , the relation @xmath70 is obtained .",
    "this relation strongly suggests that the dual of a wrapped type ii ns5-brane is a wrapped type 0 ns5-brane .    in type ii / type ii t - duality ,",
    "an unwrapped ns5-brane is transformed into a kaluza - klein monopole with nut charge @xmath14 . on the other hand , in the case of type 0/type ii duality",
    ", the dual of an unwrapped ns5-brane should be a kaluza - klein monopole with nut charge @xmath10 .",
    "the reason for this is as follows .",
    "because the momentum of kaluza klein modes along the compactified direction is quantized as @xmath71 , the minimum electric charge coupled with the @xmath72 gauge field @xmath73 is @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , due to the dirac quantization condition , the minimum nut charge is @xmath10 .",
    "kaluza - klein monopoles with nut charge @xmath10 can be made by dividing the taub - nut manifold by @xmath6 , generated by a half shift of the @xmath0 cycle . because there exists the monodromy @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) in type ii ( type 0 ) theory ,",
    "the shift should be accompanied by the operator @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the central region of this kaluza - klein monopole is @xmath74 .",
    "@xmath6 is generated by @xmath75 ( type ii ) or @xmath76 ( type 0 ) , where @xmath77 is the parity operator which changes the coordinates @xmath78 on the @xmath79 to @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , the origin of the manifold is the @xmath81 singularity .",
    "next , let us consider massless spectra on ns5-branes . on every ns5-brane , there exist four massless scalar fields representing the position of the brane . in the dual picture",
    ", they appear as zero modes of ns - ns fields on the kaluza - klein monopole .",
    "in addition to these , on type ii ns5-branes , a one - form @xmath72 gauge field ( type iib ) or self - dual two - form and zero - form gauge fields ( type iia ) exist .",
    "( here , we focus only on bosonic fields . )",
    "these gauge fields are represented as zero modes of r - r fields on the kaluza - klein monopoles .",
    "indeed , there is one zero mode of a self - dual two - form field on the taub - nut manifold .",
    "therefore , in type 0a theory , a zero mode of an r - r three - form field @xmath82 ( the indices @xmath83 and @xmath84 label the directions contained in the taub - nut manifold , and @xmath85 labels the flat directions parallel to the kaluza - klein monopole . )",
    "gives a @xmath72 gauge field , while a zero mode of the other r - r three - form field @xmath86 is projected out by @xmath6 .",
    "in the same way , on the kaluza - klein monopole in type 0b theory , there are zero modes of the four - form field @xmath87 and the two - form field @xmath88 , and they correspond to the self - dual two - form field and zero - form gauge field on type iia ns5-branes .",
    "zero modes of @xmath89 and @xmath90 are projected out by @xmath6 again .",
    "conversely , by analyzing the type ii kaluza - klein monopoles , we can find gauge fields on type 0 ns5-branes . on the type iia kaluza - klein monopole",
    ", there is a zero mode of the r - r three - form field @xmath82 , and on the type iib kaluza - klein monopole , zero modes of @xmath87 and @xmath88 exist .",
    "because the monodromy @xmath1 acts on bosonic fields trivially , none of these zero modes are projected out .",
    "furthermore , to obtain complete spectra , we should consider the twisted sector at the orbifold singularities .",
    "from the ( r@xmath41,r@xmath42 ) sectors of twisted closed strings at the singularities , we obtain a one - form gauge field ( type iia ) or a zero - form gauge field and an anti - self - dual two - form field ( type iib ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that gauge fields on type 0 ns5-branes are doubled and non - chiral , like the r - r fields in the bulk . that is , in addition to four scalar fields corresponding to fluctuations of branes , there exist two zero - form gauge fields and an unconstrained two - form field on a type 0a ns5-brane and two one - form fields on a type 0b ns5-brane .",
    "these fields are necessary for the electric and magnetic d - branes to be attached independently on ns5-branes.@xcite    in the supersymmetric @xmath91 orbifold case , four massless scalar fields appear in the ( ns@xmath40,ns@xmath40 ) sector of twisted closed strings .",
    "they belong to the @xmath92 of the @xmath93 rotation group and correspond to the ( geometric and non - geometric ) blow - up modes of the singularity . in the present case , from the twisted ( ns@xmath42,ns@xmath42 ) sector , we have four massless scalar fields belonging to the @xmath94 representation . because they have chirality opposite to that of those in the supersymmetric case , they correspond to ` non - supersymmetric blow up modes ' ; they express a blow up respecting hyper - khler structure that differs from that of the kaluza - klein monopole before the blow up . if these modes are switched on , all the supersymmetries are broken . due to this property",
    ", they can acquire mass , and , perhaps , they are removed from the massless spectrum . after the blow up , the manifold becomes smooth and simply connected .",
    "therefore the wrapping number of a string is not conserved and , at first sight , it seems that the gso projection , which depends on the wrapping number , is ill - defined .",
    "however , this is not a problem , as explained below . because the worldsheet fermions @xmath95 ( we use ns - r formalism . )",
    "take values in the tangent bundle of the target space at @xmath96 , the boundary conditions of @xmath95 depend on the target space holonomy along closed strings .",
    "using the complex coordinates @xmath97 , @xmath98 and their hermitian conjugates @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) , the action of @xmath101 rotation is expressed as @xmath102 the kaluza - klein monopole with non - supersymmetric blow up is approximately divided into two parts : the central region , which is almost @xmath81 ale , and the outer region , which is only weakly affected by the blow up modes .",
    "these two regions possess different hyper - khler structures , and holonomies of cycles in the outer and central regions are elements of @xmath103 and @xmath104 , respectively .",
    "let us consider a process in which a wrapped string in the outer region moves adiabatically into the central region and the wrapping becomes loose . in the initial and final string configurations , the holonomy along the string is @xmath105 ( the rank two unit matrix ) . on a string",
    "passing across the border between the two regions , where the target space is approximately @xmath74 , the holonomy is @xmath106 .",
    "connecting these with passes in @xmath103 and @xmath104 , we obtain the change of the holonomy during the adiabatic process as follows : @xmath107[c]{the outer region } & & & & \\makebox[0em][c]{the border } & & & & \\makebox[0em][c]{the central region } \\\\ { \\bf1}_2 & \\rightarrow & g_l\\in su(2)_l & \\rightarrow & -{\\bf1}_2 & \\rightarrow & g_r\\in su(2)_r & \\rightarrow & { \\bf1}_2 \\end{array}\\ ] ] more explicitly , for example , we can choose the path of the string so that @xmath108 and @xmath109 , where @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) is a parameter in the outer ( central ) region changing from @xmath112 to @xmath113 ( from @xmath113 to @xmath112 ) .",
    "in this case , the phases @xmath114 in the boundary conditions of the fermions @xmath115 are change as @xmath116[c]{the outer region } & & & & \\makebox[0em][c]{the border } & & & & \\makebox[0em][c]{the central region } \\\\",
    "\\omega_1 & :   & 0 & \\rightarrow & \\theta_1 & \\rightarrow & \\pi & \\rightarrow & \\theta_2 & \\rightarrow & 0 \\\\ \\omega_2 & :   & 0 & \\rightarrow & -\\theta_1 & \\rightarrow & -\\pi & \\rightarrow & \\theta_2 - 2\\pi & \\rightarrow & -2\\pi .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] ( here , we are considering the ns - ns sector . for the r - r sector",
    ", we should use the boundary conditions @xmath117 . ) therefore , this process causes a shift of the oscillators of @xmath118 ( @xmath119 for the left - moving fermions and @xmath120 for the right - moving fermions ) while the oscillators of @xmath121 do not change ( @xmath122 and @xmath123 ) .",
    "this shift implies that even if we started from a string in the ground state @xmath124 , we have an excited state @xmath125 after the adiabatic process .",
    "these two states have different eigenvalues of operators @xmath2 and @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is operator that counts left - moving worldsheet fermions .",
    "if the initial state is ( not ) projected away by the gso projection , the final state also should ( not ) be projected away .",
    "therefore , we should impose different gso projection on the initial and final states .",
    "finally , i would like to note that the scenario described above does not work for type 0 kaluza - klein monopoles , which are dual to type ii ns5-branes , because the @xmath35 twist can not be explained by holonomies of the target space .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that no bosonic fields appear in the twisted sector of type 0 strings .",
