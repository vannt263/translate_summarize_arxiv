    "-line ( tl ) theory is a powerful concept which simplifies the fields of transverse electromagnetic ( tem ) modes and allows them to be expressed as circuit quantities , making it a critical tool for high - accuracy circuit design .",
    "basic tl systems contain only two conductors , whereas generalized _ multiconductor _ tl ( mtl ) systems may contain three or more conductors .",
    "the two common representations ( or  domains \" ) of mtls are as follows :    1 .   the _ terminal _ domain ( also referred to as the _ natural _ domain ) , in which the various tl parameters are defined between each conductor and a pre - selected reference conductor .",
    "these parameters are expressed as matrices which are ( generally ) fully populated , which implies that the terminals are coupled to each other .",
    "the _ modal _ domain ( also referred to as the _ diagonalized _ or _ decoupled _",
    "domain ) , in which the tl s properties are given in terms of the tl s characteristic modes and expressed as diagonal matrices .",
    "the diagonality of the matrices implies that the solutions are isolated from one another , and due to this fact , each mode can be expressed by a simple two - conductor tl model .",
    "a process exists by which the terminal - domain parameters may be transformed into the modal domain , and vice - versa @xcite .",
    "this process , known as diagonalization , results in the solution of two _ transformation _ matrices , which are responsible for transforming the currents and voltages ( and by extension , other parameters ) between the two domains .",
    "these matrices are solved independently , which is the source of some ambiguity when they are used together . the specific process of , for example",
    ", the diagonalization of the propagation constant requires that only one of the transformation matrices be used and solved ; however , the process for the diagonalization of some properties such as the characteristic impedance involves both the transformation matrices .",
    "this fact has historically resulted in the conclusion that some modal properties such as characteristic impedance are generally ambiguous when transformed from the terminal domain ( although other methods may of course be used to obtain the correct values , such as derivation from known modal field quantities @xcite ) .    over roughly the last two decades , solutions have been proposed in attempts to overcome this ambiguity @xcite , and present similar processes to what will be introduced in this work , but generally either utilize ambiguous normalizations that lack physical bases , or produce non - unique results .",
    "this work demonstrates that any such ambiguities can be resolved by noting that physical quantities  specifically , total power and current  must be equivalent under both forms of representation .",
    "these physical facts are used together to constrain the spectrum of possible mathematical solutions and produce unique modal results . while attempts have been made to equate total real power in both domains",
    "@xcite , it will be shown that the consideration of total power ( i.e. , including the reactive component ) is required in order to produce a unique solution .",
    "additionally , it can be demonstrated that given the equivalence of these properties in the two domains , the transformation matrices are required to be real .",
    "the layout of this document is as follows : the analytical process of the terminal - to - modal transformation is detailed in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] , along with the mathematical description of the ambiguity in the transforms relations , a brief overview of previously proposed solutions , and its resolution .",
    "[ sec : examples ] details the data obtained for a number of tls and demonstrates how the correct modal characteristic impedances may be directly computed using only the terminal domain per - unit - length inductance and capacitance matrices , even in the presence of extreme loss .",
    "the analysis of tl systems typically begins with extracting their per - unit - length inductance and capacitance matrices ( @xmath0 $ ] and @xmath1 $ ] , respectively ) .",
    "these matrices detail the terminal - domain values , but for clarity in the following analysis , the subscripts @xmath2 and @xmath3 will be used to indicate which domain ( terminal or modal ) is being used in each matrix , e.g. , @xmath4 $ ] or @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "the transformation between the two domains makes use of similarity transforms , specified in terms of currents and voltages , and which are expressed as ( nonsingular ) matrices @xcite .",
    "these transformations are defined as    @xmath6 \\vec{v}_m\\ ] ]    @xmath7 \\vec{i}_m\\ ] ]    such that each column of @xmath8 $ ] and @xmath9 $ ] corresponds to a particular mode , and for which the entries describe the _ relative _",
    "( i.e. , with respect to the modal quantities ) currents and voltages on each conductor for that mode .",

    "specifically , since these two equations are of the form @xmath27 = \\left[q\\right]^{\\text{-}1 } \\left[m\\right ] \\left[q\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath28 $ ] is a matrix to be diagonalized , @xmath29 $ ] is the diagonalization matrix , and @xmath30 $ ] is a diagonal matrix said to be the diagonalized form of @xmath28 $ ] , a regular eigenvalue process is typically used to simultaneously solve for @xmath29 $ ] and @xmath30 $ ] , given @xmath28 $ ] .",

    "furthermore , it can be shown that since @xmath29^{\\text{-}1 } \\left[m\\right ] \\left[q\\right]$ ] is diagonal , the product @xmath31^{\\text{-}1 } \\left[q\\right]^{\\text{-}1 } \\left[m\\right ] \\left[q\\right ] \\left[g\\right]$ ] reduces simply to @xmath29^{\\text{-}1 } \\left[m\\right ] \\left[q\\right]$ ] , such that the value of @xmath31 $ ] has no bearing on the solution values @xmath30 $ ] and @xmath29 $ ] in ( [ eq : example_diagonalization_qg ] ) @xcite .",
    "this fact allows for the correct diagonalization of the propagation constants in ( [ eq : g_definition_1 ] ) and ( [ eq : g_definition_2 ] ) , regardless of the values of @xmath31 $ ] .",
    "the problem with this ambiguity arises from attempting to solve any of ( [ eq : z_transform ] ) , ( [ eq : y_transform ] ) , ( [ eq : zc_transform ] ) , for which @xmath9 $ ] and @xmath8 $ ] could each be post - multiplied by an arbitrary diagonal matrix  however , in these equations , the value of @xmath31 $ ] will indeed have a direct impact on the diagonalized results , for example @xmath36 = \\left[g_v\\right]^{\\text{-}1 } \\left[t_v\\right]^{\\text{-}1 } \\left[{z_c}_t\\right ] \\left[t_i\\right ] \\left[g_i\\right],\\ ] ] the solution of which is presently ambiguous . in the following work the correction matrices",

    "presently , there exist some strategies for solving the appropriate values of @xmath39 $ ] and @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "two of the most common are based on simple normalizations that are typically arbitrarily chosen and applied ; both were detailed extensively in @xcite .",
    "the first is the normalization of the product @xmath9^t \\left[t_i\\right]$ ] , for which it was shown that the symmetric nature of @xmath41 ^ 2 $ ] , @xmath12 $ ] , @xmath13 $ ] leads to the conclusion that @xmath42^t}_{new } { \\left[t_v\\right]}_{new } = { \\left[t_v\\right]^t}_{new } { \\left[t_i\\right]}_{new } = \\left[d\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath30 $ ] is any diagonal matrix , typically chosen to be identity for convenience .",
    "this is the introduction of one ambiguity , since the choice is entirely arbitrary .",
    "the second method involves a form of self - normalization of the matrix diagonals , such that @xmath43^t}_{new } \\left[t_i\\right]_{new } = { \\left[t_v\\right]^t}_{new } \\left[t_v\\right]_{new } = \\left[i\\right]\\ ] ] this process also introduces some ambiguity , since there is no physical justification for such a method .",
    "however , even though these processes are not rigorously justified or correct , they typically result in solutions with tolerable error , and therefore have been widely adopted .",
    "some work has also been done in attempting to normalize via physical quantities such as voltage , current , and power , but this has generally resulted in non - unique solutions @xcite .",
    "the definition of such a modal - terminal domain transformation relies on the fact that both domains are equally valid representations of the same physical system .",
    "therefore , various physical properties must be equivalent in both domains , foremostly , total energy and total charge . in the frequency domain ,",
    "these are directly related to total power and current .",
    "accordingly , the following are postulated :    * that the total power being carried by a tl in the modal domain is equal to that carried in the terminal domain .",
    "this will be elaborated on in sec .",
    "[ sec : powerconservation ] .",
    "* that the total co - directed currents in the modal domain are equal to the total of those in the terminal domain",
    ". this will be investigated in sec .",
    "[ sec : currentconservation ] .",
    "while the total voltages and currents in the terminal domain ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively ) represent a superposition of excited modes , it will be of interest to examine the effects of a single excited mode in the terminal domain . in this case , these terminal voltages and currents will be expressed as :    @xmath46 \\vec{\\delta}_n { v_m}_n\\ ] ]    @xmath47 \\vec{\\delta}_n { i_m}_n\\ ] ]    where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the voltage and current of the excited mode @xmath50 , respectively , and the delta vector @xmath51 is defined as @xmath52 the complex - conjugate transpose of a matrix or vector will be expressed as @xmath53^ * = \\overline{\\left[a\\right]}^t,\\ ] ] where the over - bar denotes the element - wise complex conjugate .",

    "consider first a single excited mode , @xmath50 , which is modelled via a two - conductor tl .",
    "the current magnitude for this mode is expressed , in accordance with the previous definitions , as @xmath49 . while this is a single quantity , there are of course two currents present : one on each conductor",
    ". let the magnitude of the current on one of the conductors be labelled @xmath65 , and the magnitude of the current flowing in the opposite direction ",
    "that is , on the other conductor  be labelled @xmath66 .",
    "the conservation of current enforces the equality of the currents @xmath67 .",
    "consider next a tl with more than two conductors , as described in the terminal domain .",
    "assume for now that the current carried by the reference conductor is included in the set of all currents .",
    "it is certain that the conservation of current specifies that the sum of the currents on all conductors must be zero .",
    "similar to the modal domain tl , assume that the current magnitudes may be divided into two sets @xmath68 and @xmath69 , with the membership of the sets being determined by the phase of these currents with respect to the modal currents .",
    "although it may seem intuitive for tem modes , a proof that only two such contra - directed phases ( corresponding to co- and contra - directed currents ) exist is supplied in appendix [ sec : appendixcontradirectedphases ] . according to the conservation of current",
    ", the sums of each group must be equal to each other , that is : @xmath70 .",
    "furthermore , the set of total currents on all conductors is equal to the difference of the two groups , such that @xmath71 the vector @xmath68 will then contain an entry of zero wherever @xmath69 has a nonzero entry , and vice - versa , such that all vectors have the same length ( which is the number of conductors in the tl ) .",
    "it is known from ( [ eq : ti_def ] ) that the distribution of terminal - domain currents is dictated by the transformation matrix @xmath8 $ ]  that is , if a single mode is excited , the currents on each conductor are uniquely specified by the corresponding column of @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "let the transformation matrix then be separated into two new matrices ",

    "the unique determination of the properties of tl modes may find meaningful applications in fields such as electromagnetic compatibility , signal and power integrity in printed - circuit - board environments , and the analysis of coupling between closely spaced power system circuits .",

    "david sawyer for inspirational discussion and proof - reading of this work .",
    "it is typically assumed that the forms of the transformation matrices @xmath9 $ ] and @xmath8 $ ] are not limited .",
    "however , this assumption implies that for a given excited mode , currents may be excited which possess any arbitrary phase , with respect to the excitation . here",
    ", this possibility is formally investigated , assuming only the equivalence of power between the two domains .    comparing ( [ eq : g_definition_1 ] ) to the transpose of ( [ eq : g_definition_2 ] ) in the case of corrected transformation matrices , and noting that the matrices @xmath12 $ ] and @xmath13 $ ] are symmetric , it can be concluded that @xmath132_{new } = \\left[t_i\\right]_{new}^{\\text{-}1 t } \\left[d\\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath30 $ ] is an arbitrary matrix , which is required to be diagonal . inserting @xmath9_{new}$ ] into the proposed equality of power ( [ eq : modal_terminal_power_condition ] ) yields @xmath133 = \\overline{\\left[t_i\\right]}_{new}^{\\text{\\ -}1 }   \\left[t_i\\right]_{new}\\ ] ] the right - hand side of the preceding equation is not generally diagonal for any complex @xmath8_{new}$ ] , whereas @xmath30 $ ] is required to be diagonal .",
    "this apparent contradiction is resolved by rearranging ( [ eq : diagonality_of_d ] ) to give @xmath134_{new } = \\overline{\\left[t_i\\right]}_{new } \\left[d\\right]\\ ] ] observe that this can also be expressed as @xmath135_{new } = \\overline{\\overline{\\left[t_i\\right]}_{new } \\left[d\\right ] } \\left[d\\right]\\ ] ] which can be further simplified to @xmath136_{new } = \\left[t_i\\right]_{new } \\left[\\left|d\\right|\\right]^2\\ ] ] this interesting result yields a pair of useful conclusions .",
    "firstly , observing each column @xmath50 of the transformation matrix , where @xmath137 , it is noted that if @xmath138 , then @xmath139 must equal @xmath140 , a case that can be physically discounted , since it represents a mode that excites no terminal - domain currents . secondly , it is then noted that @xmath141 must be of the form @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is any real number . inserting this observation into each row of ( [ eq : diagonality_of_d2 ] ) yields",
    "@xmath144 generally , expressing each entry in @xmath139 in polar form gives the following : @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the phase angle of the complex entry @xmath147 .",
    "note that this equation implies @xmath148 and thus , @xmath149 where @xmath150 is any integer .",
    "this result relates the phase of any element in a given column of @xmath8_{new}$ ] to the value @xmath143 , which only depends on the column @xmath50 . that is to say",
    ", the elements of each column @xmath50 can only possess one of two possible phases , which are 180@xmath93 out of phase with each other .",
    "a similar conclusion can be demonstrated for the phases of @xmath9_{new}$ ] .",
    "having established that in the terminal domain , there exist only two phases of currents which are 180@xmath93 apart , let the set @xmath72_{new}$ ] be defined as consisting of the terms of @xmath8_{new}$ ] which possess a phase of @xmath142 , and @xmath73_{new}$ ] as consisting of the terms of @xmath8_{new}$ ] which possess a phase of @xmath151 ( removing the @xmath152 phase shift ) :    @xmath153_{new } = \\left[|t_i(+)|\\right]_{new } \\left[e^{j\\theta}\\right]\\ ] ]    @xmath154_{new } = \\left[|t_i(-)|\\right]_{new } \\left[e^{j\\theta}\\right]\\ ] ]    where @xmath155_{new}$ ] and @xmath156_{new}$ ] are matrices for which each entry is the magnitude of the corresponding entry in @xmath72_{new}$ ] and @xmath73_{new}$ ] , respectively , and @xmath157 $ ] is a diagonal matrix , the entries of which are @xmath142 . inserting these relations into ( [ eq : conservation_of_charge_positive3 ] ) and ( [ eq : conservation_of_charge_negative3 ] ) , respectively , gives :    @xmath158_{new } \\left[e^{j\\theta}\\right ] \\vec{\\delta}_n\\ ] ]    @xmath159_{new } \\left[e^{j\\theta}\\right ] \\vec{\\delta}_n\\ ] ]    which establish that @xmath160 .",
    "this is a remarkable result since , in conjunction with ( [ eq : modal_terminal_power_condition ] ) , it clearly indicates that the corrected transformation matrices are real .",
    "obtaining the sum of each of the ( non - reference ) components of the columns of @xmath8 $ ] will yield two quantities : if these values are equal , then it can be stated conclusively that the current component on the reference conductor is zero , and that the value of @xmath161 is simply the inverse of either the positive or negative sum . if the two sums do not have the same magnitude ,",
    "then the larger sum is the correct value ( with the difference being the current component on the reference conductor ) , the inverse of which is @xmath161 . with this knowledge , the pseudocode alg .",
    "[ correctionalgorithm ] is proposed , where all scalar or matrix values are assumed to be of a complex , floating - point type , unless they are indices .",
    "this algorithm has an outermost loop which iterates over each column . for each column",
    ", a guard loop ensures that the column is sufficiently corrected before proceeding to the next column ",
    "if it is not , then the inner loop is repeated .",
    "the inner loop has four main processes : in order of operation , the positive and negative sums are computed , and the larger sum is selected and evaluated .",
    "if the sum is sufficiently close to 1 , the guard loop is notified that the process is complete , otherwise the column s @xmath161 is multiplied by the inverse of the sum and the loop is repeated .",
    "lastly , once the complete @xmath40 $ ] matrix has been calculated for all columns , the corrected @xmath8 $ ] can be calculated , and utilizing the power equality , @xmath9 $ ] is calculated directly from this .",
