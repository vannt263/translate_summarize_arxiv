    "the detailed properties of multiplicity distributions of gluon and quark jets are studied in experiment nowadays @xcite",

    "they alternate in sign , and third coefficients are larger than the first ones .",
    "it is an indication on the sign - alternating asymptotic series , and borel summation can be effective here .",
    "the increase of the coefficients originates from the terms containing the integrals of the type @xmath63 .",

    "the first correction given by @xmath66(susy)=@xmath67(susy)=0.844 is almost as large as for ordinary gluon jets .",
    "it is similar to the correction for second moments .",
    "however , nnlo and 3nlo - terms for moments in susy qcd differ drastically from those for ordinary jets both in absolute values and signs as seen from the tables 1 and 2 .",
    "it demonstrates their sensitivity to the value of @xmath68 which is drastically different in the two cases .",
    "the similar procedure can be used for higher rank moments as well .",
    "the equations ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) are dealing with probabilities and , therefore , are of classical nature .",
    "however , the quantum - mechanical interference has been accounted in the angular ordering effect .",
    "nevertheless , there is no proof of their validity at all orders .",
    "the approach advocated above treats these equations as the kinetic equations in qcd for partonic cascade processes .",
    "implicitly we have assumed that these equations describe the cascade down to extremely low energies of partons by imposing the limits 0 and 1 of integration in the shares of energy .",
    "thus the non - perturbative region of soft partons was assumed to be described in the same manner as the perturbative cascade .",
    "probably , one should include into the consideration only the perturbative region by the requirement that the evolution parameters under the integral in ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) stay always positive i.e. by introducing the cut - off at @xmath69 and @xmath70 where @xmath71 .",
    "such a modification would lead to the power - like corrections which can be neglected asymptotically but contribute at present energies .",
    "their role was considered for average multiplicities in @xcite .",
    "they are not very important for the moments in the nlo - approximation as shown above . however , more thorough treatment is needed , especially , in view of rather large contribution of soft gluons to @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "other analytic solutions of these equations different from the perturbative one as well as nonperturbative modifications of the equations @xcite can be looked for .",
    "especially interesting would be to learn more about the singularities of the generating functions in the @xmath9-plane which are known up to now for the leading order solution only .    leaving this program for future studies",
    ", we can now compare the results obtained from perturbative solutions of the equations for average multiplicities [ 3 - 7 ] and for widths of the multiplicity distributions of gluon and quark jets up to 3nlo approximation of pqcd .",
    "leading order predictions for any quantity are quite far from present experimental data .",
    "nlo corrections are always pointing in the right direction of closer agreement with experiment .",
    "in particular , the energy dependence of the gluon jet average multiplicity , of the ratio of its slopes for gluon and quark jets and the values of widths at @xmath74-energies can be fitted with rather high accuracy .",
    "however , it still fails in the ratio of average multiplicities of gluon and quark jets differing from experiment by about 30@xmath0 in absolute values and even more in its energy dependence slope @xcite . here ,",
    "2nlo and 3nlo terms improve the situation so that the ratio @xmath75 differs by about 1015@xmath0 only",
    ". they do not spoil good qualitative features of nlo in the energy dependence @xcite .",
    "however , these corrections become very large for the widths and for the third moments as shown above , as well as for the slope and curvature in the energy dependence of average multiplicities @xcite .",
    "thus we conclude that present perturbative qcd results can describe the experimental data within 1015@xmath0 accuracy .",
    "the perturbative series breaks down , however , at different orders for different quantities .",
    "there seems to be no standard way to improve the analytic results and unanimously predict where one should truncate the expansion .",
    "nevertheless , the general trends obtained from the perturbative approach are steadily indicating qualitative convergence of theory and experiment .",
    "moreover , the computer results @xcite show that the exact solutions of qcd equations can be even closer to experiment .",
