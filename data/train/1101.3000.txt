    "begging from works by ohm in xix century @xcite and till seventeenth of xx century all studies of ordinary conductivity in solid crystals were restricted by the weak field regime , where the electric field is considered as a perturbation .",
    "this approach was actually justified because for typical laboratory conditions the bloch frequency , which is proportional to the electric field , is much smaller than the characteristic relaxation rate in a crystal .",
    "the situation has changed in 1970 , when esaki and tsu reported first measurements of the ohm current in semiconductor superlattices @xcite .",
    "it was found that with increase of the electric field the current reaches some maximum value and then decreases  the phenomenon known nowadays as the negative differential conductivity . this pioneering work initiated experimental and theoretical studies of ordinary conductivity in the strong field regime , where the electric field can not be considered as a perturbation .",
    "we note that , besides semiconductor superlattices , the negative differential conductivity was also observed for cold neutral atoms in ( quasi ) 1d optical lattices subjected to a static force @xcite .",
    "a great advantage of the latter system over semiconductor superlattices is full experimental control over relaxation processes . because of this control one can study with cold atoms both the hamiltonian and dissipative dynamics of the carriers , i.e , bloch oscillations and ohmic current .",
    "a different yet related transport problem is the hall current in quantum dot and antidot arrays ( see , @xcite , to cite a few of hundreds relevant papers ) .",
    "these systems can be considered as 2d superlattices , where the 2d electron gas is subjected to a periodic potential with period of few hundreds nanometers .",
    "here researches mainly focus on the effect of a magnetic field rather than on bloch oscillations @xcite .",
    "indeed , because of a large superlattice period already a modest magnetic field @xmath0 t causes dramatic changes in the electron energy spectrum .",
    "this new spectrum is then substituted in the kubo - type equation to calculate the conductivity tensor @xmath1 . during the last two decades",
    "many exciting theoretical and experimental results on the hall conductivity in quantum - dot arrays were reported .",
    "these studies revealed very nontrivial dependence of the conductivity tensor on the magnetic field and the fermi energy .",
    "let us also note that in a typical quantum - dot array the fermi energy of the 2d electron gas is in a bloch ( mini)band with large index @xmath2 , so that the single - band approximation , which is known to result in the famous hofstadter s butterfly spectrum @xcite , is not applicable . because of this complication of the problem",
    "almost all theoretical studies on the hall conductivity in quantum - dot arrays have been restricted by the linear response regime @xcite .",
    "recently it has been noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite that the hofstadter butterfly can be realized with cold atoms in a 2d optical lattice by introducing an artificial magnetic field , which imposes the lorentz force on moving neutral atoms . to create this artificial field the authors of the cited paper suggested to use raman transitions between the internal atomic states",
    "this idea of an artificial magnetic field was developed further in other publications and today there are several different theoretical proposals for creating effective magnetic fields for atoms in a lattice ( see , for example , the recent paper @xcite and references therein ) and a successful realization of one of schemes for atoms in a harmonic trap @xcite .",
    "thus this is a matter of time when experimentalists will be able to mimic magnetic fields for cold atoms in a lattice , in the same manner as they now routinely mimic electric fields . since optical lattices are much cleaner and controllable systems than quantum - dot arrays , this will open wide perspectives for studying the hall conductivity in different parameter regimes , including the nonlinear response regime .",
    "the present work precedes these anticipated experimental studies .",
    "it presents a semi - analytical method for calculating the hall current in the single - band approximation which , as mentioned above , can be easily justified for cold atoms in optical lattices .",
    "the method treats magnetic and electric fields on equal footing and , hence , goes beyond the linear response theory . in this sense",
    "we extend the esaki - tsu approach to the ohm current in 1d lattices onto the hall current in 2d lattices .",
    "first we recall the reader few results on ordinary conductivity in the non - perturbative regime .",
    "to explain the negative differential conductactivity in semiconductor superlattices esaki and tsu used a kind of semiclassical approach , which resulted in the following dependence for the ohm current : @xmath3 in eq .",
    "( [ 0 ] ) @xmath4 is the electric field , @xmath5 the lattice period , @xmath6 the charge , @xmath7 the relaxation constant , and the pre - factor @xmath8 accounts for the temperature dependence of the current [ @xmath9 .",
    "a microscopic derivation of the esaki - tsu dependence ( [ 0 ] ) was given by minot in 2004 @xcite .",
    "this was obtained by solving the master equation for the carriers one - particle density matrix @xmath10 : @xmath11 -\\gamma(\\hat{\\rho } - \\hat{\\rho}_0 ) \\;.\\ ] ] in this equation @xmath12 is the single - particle hamiltonian of a carrier in a biased superlattice , @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the equilibrium density matrix for @xmath15 , @xmath16 the model ( [ 0a]-[0c ] ) results in eq .",

    "@xcite with respect to the problem of ordinary conductivity with cold atoms in 1d optical lattices",
    ". a weak point of the master equation ( [ 0a ] ) is that it is not in the lindblad form .",
    "( exclusions are the cases of zero and infinite temperature , where it can be rewritten in the lindblad form . ) because of this drawback it may give wrong result for the velocity distribution of the carriers . however , it was confirmed that it gives qualitatively correct result for the mean velocity , i.e. , the current .",
    "the master equation ( [ 0a ] ) will be our theoretical framework in studying the hall conductivity in 2d lattices .",
    "we consider a quantum particle in a square lattice of side @xmath5 in the @xmath18 plane . the particle is subjected to an in - plane electric field @xmath4 , aligned with the @xmath19 axis , and a magnetic field @xmath20 normal to the @xmath18 plane . using the tight - binding approximation and the gauge @xmath21 for the vector potential",
    "the particle hamiltonian reads @xmath22 @xmath23 the dimensionless parameter @xmath24 in ( [ 1b ] ) is the peierls phase , which is given by number of magnetic flux quanta per unit - cell area , @xmath25 .",
    "besides the peierls phase @xmath24 and the bloch frequency @xmath26 the other important characteristics of the system are the carrier effective mass , @xmath27 , the cyclotron frequency , @xmath28 , and the drift velocity @xmath29 .",
    "we note that for a charged particle ( electron in a solid crystal ) the hamiltonian ( [ 1b ] ) is justified only in the limit of small @xmath24 , where the cyclotron radius of the classical orbit essentially exceeds the lattice period .",
    "this is , however , not the case for cold atoms in optical lattices , where the actual parameter of the system is the peierls phase but not the magnitude of a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "hence , we impose no limitations on @xmath24 and , without any loss of generality , one may consider @xmath30 .",

    "we considered the quantum particle in a 2d lattice subjected to ( real or artificial ) electric and magnetic fields and calculated the hall and ohm currents as functions of the electric field magnitude .",
    "although the obtained dependence @xmath85 for the hall current resembles the esaki - tsu dependence @xmath97 for the ohm current in the absence of magnetic field , the physics behind these two dependences is completely different .",
    "indeed , the esaki - tsu dependence for the ohm current appears due to an interplay between bloch oscillations and relaxation processes and the ohm current vanishes if @xmath84 .",
    "conversely , the hall current in the transverse direction takes place even in the absence of dissipation . the actual reason for the esaki - tsu like dependence for the hall current is a qualitative change in the structure of the landau - stark states , which happens around @xmath88 .",
    "note that the condition @xmath102 means the bloch frequency to coincide with the cyclotron frequency .",
    "thus the ezaki - tsu like dependence for the hall current is the result of an interplay between bloch and cyclotron oscillations but not bloch oscillations and relaxation processes .    concluding the discussion we would like to stress that in this work we do not addresss the quantum hall effect .",
    "the latter phenomenon occurs for fermionic carriers when the magnetic field or the fermi energy are varied .",
