    ", linear repetitivity ( introduced by lagarias and pleasants in @xcite ) has become a key feature ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and many known examples of quasi - crystalline solids may be modeled using linearly repetitive delone sets .    a standard tool in the study of a delone set @xmath1 is provided by its hull @xmath2 and the natural @xmath3-action on it .",
    "the hull is defined as an appropriate closure of the family @xmath4 and @xmath3 acts over the hull by translation . from this point of view",
    ", the hull can be regarded as a generalization to higher dimensions of the standard orbit - closure construction for aperiodic sequences in symbolic dynamics ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in this",
    "context , linear repetitivity corresponds to linear recurrence ( see @xcite ) .    a powerful combinatorial tool in the study of linearly recurrent subshifts is provided by kakutani - rohlin towers ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in particular ,",
    "a fundamental result in this context is the following ( see @xcite ) :    [ teocdhm ] let @xmath5 be an aperiodic linearly recurrent subshift .",
    "then there exist a sequence of kakutani - rohlin ( kr ) partitions and @xmath6 such that    a.   the number of kr towers of level @xmath7 is uniformly bounded by @xmath8 , b.   every kr tower of level @xmath7 crosses all the kr towers of level @xmath9 and the total number of these crossings is uniformly bounded by @xmath8 .",
    "an equivalent statement for theorem [ teocdhm ] is that linearly recurrent subshifts admit nested sequences of kr partitions with transition matrices that are strictly positive and uniformly bounded in norm . as a corollary , for instance , it is easy to deduce that linearly recurrent subshifts are uniquely ergodic ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "other applications include the study of spectral properties of these systems ( see @xcite ) .    in the context of delone sets ,",
    "tower systems were introduced in @xcite , and provide a proper generalization for sequence of kr towers ( see section [ sec : towers ] for the definition ) .",
    "a natural question we answer in this paper is whether an analog of theorem [ teocdhm ] for linearly repetitive delone systems and tower systems holds . to answer this question",
    ", we refine the construction in @xcite to linearly repetitive systems to obtain several estimations on parameters that control the growth of the towers and , therefore , also the norms of the associated transition matrices .",
    "our main result is the following :    let @xmath2 be the hull of a linearly repetitive delone set @xmath1 .",
    "then there exist a tower system and @xmath6 such that    a.   the number of boxes at each level is uniformly bounded by @xmath8 , b.   every box of level @xmath7 crosses every box of level @xmath9 and the total number of crossings is uniformly bounded by @xmath8 .",
    "for similar constructions , we refer to @xcite .    in @xcite , it is proved ( using standard arguments ) that delone systems satisfying the assertions of the main result are uniquely ergodic .",
    "hence , as a corollary of this result and our main result , we obtain an alternative proof of the unique ergodicity of the hull of an aperiodic linearly repetitive delone set @xmath1 .",
    "this is equivalent to say ( see e.g. @xcite ) that @xmath1 has uniform patch frequencies , i.e. , for every patch @xmath10 in @xmath1 , the number @xmath11 of patches of @xmath1 that are equivalent to @xmath10 and whose center is included in a @xmath12-cube @xmath13 of side @xmath14 , divided by the volume of @xmath13 converges to a limit , called the _ frequency _ of @xmath10 and denoted by @xmath15 , when @xmath14 goes to infinity .",
    "the existence of uniform patch frequencies is well - known for linearly repetitive delone sets , and it is a consequence of the following stronger result of lagarias and plesants @xcite :    [ teo : lpintro ] let @xmath1 be a linearly repetitive delone set .",
    "then , @xmath1 has uniform patch frequencies .",
    "moreover , there exists @xmath16 such that , for every patch @xmath10 of @xmath1 , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is either a @xmath12-cube with side @xmath14 or a ball of radius @xmath14 .    in this paper",
    ", we give an alternative proof of lagarias and pleasants theorem as an application of our main result .",
    "a key step in the proof is the introduction of a markov chain associated with the tower system , whose mixing rate is related to the constant @xmath19 .",
    "we remark that in the original proof of lagarias and pleasants , the constant @xmath19 depends on the geometry of @xmath18 .",
    "our new approach suggests that the @xmath19 should be defined purely in terms of @xmath1 and the tower system , and so we expect that the proof can be extended to provide estimations for more general additive ergodic theorems in @xcite .",
    "we also remark that the proof can be applied to self - similar systems , with better bounds , and this will be the subject of a forthcoming paper .",
    "we finish the introduction by giving the organization of the paper . in section [ sec : back ] we review the theory on delone set and the dynamical system approach that will be needed in the sequel . in section [ sec : boxes ] , we review the definition of tower system and prove the main result , by supposing the existence of a tower system satisfying some extra conditions ( see theorem [ thm : towerslr ] ) . in section [ proof : gambaudo ] we prove the existence of this tower system . then , the construction of the markov chain and the proof of lagarias - pleasant s theorem are given , respectively , in section [ sec : markov ] and section [ seclp ] .",
