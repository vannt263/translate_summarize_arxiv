    "deciding whether a given bipartite quantum state is entangled or separable ( or even just close to separable ) is known to be a computationally hard task ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "several much more easily checkable necessary conditions for separability do exist though , the most famous and widely used ones being perhaps the positivity of partial transpose criterion @xcite , the realignment criterion @xcite or the @xmath0-extendibility criterion @xcite . all of them have in common that verifying if a given state fulfils them or not may be cast as a semi - definite program ( sdp ) and hence be efficiently solved ( see e.g.  the quite extensive review @xcite for much more on that topic ) .",
    "we focus here on a relaxation of the notion of separability of quite different kind : the so - called @xmath0-extendibility criterion for separability , which was introduced in @xcite .",
    "it is especially appealing because it provides a hierarchy of increasingly powerful separability tests ( expressible as sdps of increasing dimension ) , which is additionally complete , meaning that any entangled state is guaranteed to fail a test after some finite number of steps in the hierarchy .",
    "let us be more precise .",
    "let @xmath7 .",
    "a state @xmath8 on a bipartite hilbert space @xmath9 is @xmath0-extendible with respect to @xmath10 if there exists a state @xmath11 on @xmath12 which is invariant under any permutation of the @xmath10 subsystems and such that @xmath13 .",
    "[ th : k - extendibility - criterion ] a state on a bipartite hilbert space @xmath9 is separable if and only if it is @xmath0-extendible with respect to @xmath10 for all @xmath7 .",
    "note that one direction in theorem [ th : k - extendibility - criterion ] is obvious , namely that a separable state on some bipartite system is necessarily @xmath0-extendible for all @xmath7 ( with respect to both subsystems ) .",
    "indeed , if @xmath14 is separable , then @xmath15 and @xmath16 are symmetric extensions of @xmath17 to @xmath0 copies of the first and second subsystems respectively .",
    "the other direction in theorem [ th : k - extendibility - criterion ] follows from the quantum finite de finetti theorem ( see e.g.  @xcite for the seminal statements ) .",
    "the latter establishes , roughly speaking , that starting from a permutation - invariant state on some tensor power system and tracing out all except a few of the subsystems , one gets a state that may be well - approximated by a convex combination of tensor power states ( with a vanishing error as the initial number of subsystems increases ) .",
    "it is easy to see that if a state is @xmath0-extendible for some @xmath7 , then it is automatically @xmath18-extendible for all @xmath19 .",
    "hence , the necessary and sufficient condition for separability provided by theorem [ th : k - extendibility - criterion ] actually decomposes into a series of increasingly constraining necessary conditions for separability , which are only asymptotically also sufficient ( see figure [ fig : k - ext ] ) . in real life however , checks can only be done up to a finite level in this hierarchy .",
    "it thus makes sense to ask , given a finite @xmath7 , how `` powerful '' the @xmath0-extendibility test is to detect entanglement .",
    "-extendibility relaxations of separability , @xmath7,width=226 ]    actually , various more quantitative versions of theorem [ th : k - extendibility - criterion ] do exist , that put bounds on how far a @xmath0-extendible state can be from separable .",
    "let us mention two quite different statements in that direction .",
    "the original result , appearing in @xcite , establishes that a state on @xmath9 which is @xmath0-extendible with respect to @xmath10 is at distance at most @xmath20 , in @xmath5-norm , from the set of separable states .",
    "it is a direct consequence of one of the quantitative versions of the quantum finite de finetti theorem .",
    "a more recent result , proved essentially in @xcite and improved in @xcite , stipulates that such a state is at distance at most @xmath21 , in @xmath22-norm , from the set of separable states ( see e.g.  @xcite for a precise definition of the operational one - way - locc norm ) .",
    "it relies on the observation that a @xmath0-extendible state has a small squashed entanglement , and therefore can not be distinguished well from a separable state by local observers .",
    "the main problem of such estimates is that they become non - trivial only when @xmath23 or @xmath24 .",
    "so in the case where @xmath25 are `` big '' , can anything interesting still be said for a `` not too big '' @xmath0 ?",
    "on the other hand , these bounds valid for any @xmath0-extendible state are known to be close from optimal ( there are examples of @xmath0-extendible states whose closest separable state is at distance of order @xmath26 in @xmath5-norm or of order @xmath27 in @xmath22-norm ) .",
    "consequently , one may only hope to make stronger statements about average behaviours .",
    "this is precisely the general question we address here , being especially interested in the case of high - dimensional bipartite quantum systems .",
    "we try and quantify in two distinct ways the typical efficiency of the @xmath0-extendibility criterion for separability in this asymptotic regime .",
    "the first approach consists in estimating a specific size parameter ( known as the _ mean width _ ) of the set of @xmath0-extendible states when the dimension of the underlying hilbert space goes to infinity . comparing the obtained value with the known asymptotic estimate for the mean width of the set of separable states",
    "then tells us how the sizes of these two sets of states scale with one another .",
    "the computation is carried out in section [ section : w(k - ext ) ] ( where all needed notions related to high - dimensional convex geometry are properly defined as well ) and ends with the concluding theorem [ th : w(k - ext ) ] , some technical parts being relegated to appendix [ appendix : gaussian ] . in section [ section : w - comparison ] , the result is commented and comparisons are made between the mean - widths of , on the one hand , @xmath0-extendible states , and on the other , separable or ppt states .",
    "besides , a smaller upper bound is derived , in section [ section : w(k - ext - ppt ] ] and its companion technical appendix [ appendix : gaussian - gamma ] , on the mean width of the set of @xmath0-extendible states whose extension is required to be ppt ( precise definitions and motivations to look at this set of states appear there ) .",
    "the second approach consists in looking at random mixed states which are obtained by partial tracing over an ancilla space a uniformly distributed pure state , and characterizing when these are , with overwhelming probability as the dimension of the system grows , @xmath0-extendible or not .",
    "again , comparing the obtained result with the known one for separability provides some information on how powerful the @xmath0-extendibility test is to detect entanglement . section",
    "[ section : random - states ] introduces all required material regarding the considered model of random - induced states and one possible way of detecting their non-@xmath0-extendibility .",
    "the adopted strategy is next seen through in section [ section : non - k - ext - witness ] , relying on technical statements put in appendix [ appendix : wishart ] , and concludes as theorem [ th : not - kext ] .",
    "the determined environment dimension below which random - induced states are with high probability violating the @xmath0-extendibility criterion is then compared , in section [ section : threshold - comparison ] , with the previously established ones for violating other separability criteria , and for actually not being separable .",
    "finally , generalizations to the unbalanced case are stated in section [ section : unbalanced ] ( theorems [ th : unbalanced ] and [ th : unbalanced ] ) , while section [ section : miscellaneous ] exposes miscellaneous concluding remarks and loose ends .",

    "the asymmetry in the definition of @xmath0-extendibility appears more strikingly in this unbalanced setting .",
    "indeed , for a finite @xmath7 , a given state on @xmath9 may be @xmath0-extendible with respect to @xmath10 but not @xmath0-extendible with respect to @xmath438 .",

    "however , what theorem [ th : unbalanced ] stipulates is that , even for a finite @xmath7 , when both subsystems grow , being @xmath0-extendible with respect to either one or the other are two constraints which are , on average , equivalently restricting . on the contrary , what theorem [ th : unbalanced ] shows is that when only one subsystem grows , and the other remains of fixed size , being @xmath0-extendible with respect to the bigger one is , on average , a tougher constraint than being @xmath0-extendible with respect to the smaller one ( as one would have probably expected ) .",
    "this is to be put in perspective with some of the original observations made in @xcite .",
    "it was indeed noticed that checking whether a state on @xmath440 is @xmath0-extendible with respect to @xmath441 requires space resources which scale as @xmath442 ^ 2 $ ] when implemented .",
    "it was therefore advised that in the unbalanced situation of @xmath2 `` big '' and @xmath443 `` small '' , one should check @xmath0-extendibility with respect to @xmath441 rather than @xmath444 , the former being much more economical . on the other hand ,",
    "it comes out from our study that , in this case , an entangled state is likely to fail passing the @xmath0-extendibility test for a smaller @xmath0 when the extension is searched with respect to @xmath444 than when it is searched with respect to @xmath441 .",
    "but understanding the precise trade - off seems out of reach at the moment .",
    "all the statements proven sofar , regarding either the @xmath0-extendibility of random - induced states or the mean width of the set of @xmath0-extendible states , converge towards the same ( expected ) conclusion : for any given @xmath7 , the @xmath0-extendibility criterion becomes a very weak necessary condition for separability when the dimension of the considered bipartite system increases .",
    "so the natural question at that point is : what can be said about the @xmath0-extendibility criterion on @xmath1 when @xmath445 is allowed to grow in some way with @xmath2 ?",
    "unfortunately , most of the results we established rely at some point on the assumption that @xmath0 is a fixed parameter , and therefore do not seem to be directly generalizable to the case where @xmath0 depends on @xmath2",
    ".    there is at least one estimate though that remains valid in this setting , which is the lower bound on the mean width of @xmath0-extendible states .",

    "so by the same arguments as in the proof of proposition [ prop : gaussian - p ] , we still have in that case at least the lower bound @xmath450 & = \\underset{f:[2p]\\rightarrow[k(d)]}{\\sum } \\underset{\\lambda\\in\\mathfrak{p}^{(2)}(2p)}{\\sum } d^{\\sharp(\\gamma^{-1}\\lambda)+\\sharp(\\gamma_f^{-1}\\lambda)+k(d)-|\\operatorname{im}(f)|}\\\\ & { \\geqslant}\\mathrm{cat}_p\\,k(d)^pd^{2p+k(d)+1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this lower bound on moments in turn guarantees , as explained in the derivation of proposition [ prop : gaussian - infty ] from proposition [ prop : gaussian - p ] , that there exist positive constants @xmath150 such that we have the inequality @xmath451 which yields the announced lower bound for the mean width of @xmath452 .    theorem [ th : w(k(d)-ext)-lower ]",
    "only provides a lower bound on the asymptotic mean width of @xmath453 when @xmath0 is allowed to depend on @xmath2 .",
    "it is nevertheless already an interesting piece of information . indeed , as mentioned in section [ section : w - comparison ] , we know from @xcite that the mean width of the set of separable states on @xmath1 is of order @xmath175 .",
    "theorem [ th : w(k(d)-ext)-lower ] therefore asserts that , on @xmath1 , one has to go at least to @xmath0 of order @xmath2 to obtain a set of @xmath0-extendible states whose mean width scales as the one of the set of separable states .",
    "furthermore , it may be worth mentioning that the proof of proposition [ prop : gaussian - infty ] actually provides additional information , namely an upper bound on the mean width of @xmath0-extendible states which remains valid for a quite wide range of @xmath0 .",
    "[ th : w(k(d)-ext)-upper ] for any @xmath449 , provided that @xmath454 and @xmath2 is big enough , the mean width of the set of @xmath447-extendible states on @xmath1 satisfies @xmath455    let @xmath449 with @xmath454 .",

    "nevertheless , since the set of @xmath0-extendible states contains the set of @xmath18-extendible states for all @xmath461 , we also have as a ( potentially weak ) consequence of theorem [ th : w(k(d)-ext)-upper ] that for @xmath462 and @xmath2 big enough , @xmath463    theorems [ th : w(k(d)-ext)-lower ] and [ th : w(k(d)-ext)-upper ] together imply in particular the following : in the regime where @xmath447 grows with @xmath2 slower than @xmath2 itself , both the ratio @xmath464 and the ratio @xmath465 are unbounded .",
    "to rephrase it , for @xmath447 having this growth rate , the set of @xmath447-extendible states lies `` strictly in between '' the set of separable states and the set of all states from an asymptotic size point of view .",
    "the result provided by theorem [ th : not - kext ] is only one - sided : it tells us that if @xmath466 , then a random mixed state on @xmath1 obtained by partial tracing on @xmath4 a uniformly distributed pure state on @xmath467 is with high probability not @xmath0-extendible .",
    "but what can be said about the case @xmath468 ? or more generally , can one find a reasonable @xmath469 such that if @xmath470 , then a random mixed state on @xmath1 obtained by partial tracing on @xmath4 a uniformly distributed pure state on @xmath467 is with high probability @xmath0-extendible ?    by the arguments discussed in extensive depth in @xcite , one can assert at least that there exists a universal constant @xmath258 such that @xmath471 is a possible value for such @xmath469 .",
    "we will not repeat the whole reasoning here , but let us still give the key ideas underlying it .",
    "define @xmath472 the translation of @xmath288 by its center of mass , the maximally mixed state @xmath192 , i.e.  @xmath473 define also @xmath474 the convex body polar to @xmath472 , i.e.  @xmath475 what then has to be specifically determined is ( see @xcite , section 2 , for further comments ) @xmath476 one can first of all use the fact that , roughly speaking , when @xmath477 , the random matrix @xmath478 for @xmath479 `` looks the same as '' the random matrix @xmath480 for @xmath481 ( see @xcite , proposition 3.1 and remark 3.2 as well as appendices a and b , for precise majorization statements and proofs ) .",
    "in particular , there exists a constant @xmath364 such that , for all @xmath312 with ( say ) @xmath482 , we have the upper bound @xmath483 next , due to the fact that , again putting it vaguely , the convex body @xmath472 is `` sufficiently well - balanced '' ( see @xcite , section 4 as well as appendices c and d , for a complete exposition of the @xmath484-position argument ) , we know that there exists a constant @xmath485 such that , for all @xmath124 , we have the upper bound @xmath486 now , @xmath487 is nothing else than the gaussian mean width of @xmath472 , which is the same as the gaussian mean width of @xmath288 , so for which we have an estimate thanks to theorem [ th : w(k - ext ) ] , namely @xmath488 .    putting everything together , we see that @xmath489 for some constant @xmath490 independent of @xmath491 , which implies as claimed that if @xmath492 , then @xmath493 .",
