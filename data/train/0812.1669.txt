    "structural properties of solids like interatomic distances , bond angles and equilibrium lattice parameters are customarily calculated by assuming that atomic nuclei ( or ionic cores ) behave as classical particles . within this framework ,",
    "the electronic problem is solved for a fixed configuration of clamped nuclei .",
    "the resulting ground state electronic density allows for the computation of the forces acting on the nuclei through hellman - feynman s theorem .",
    "these forces are then used to determine the equilibrium configuration .",
    "while this is justified for a large variety of systems of interest , the assumption of classical nuclei becomes questionable whenever light atoms such as hydrogen are involved .",
    "moreover , this approximation can not address isotope effects ; the ground state electronic energy does not depend on the nuclear masses but only on the atomic numbers . a widely - used approach to introduce the quantum nature of the nuclei",
    "is the quasi - harmonic approximation ( qha).@xcite in this approximation , the nuclear ground state energy is supplemented with the zero - point - energy ( zpe ) corresponding to _ harmonic _ nuclear vibrations .",
    "this is based on a second - order taylor expansion of the potential energy surface ( pes ) in terms of the atomic coordinates around the equilibrium configuration of the nuclei .",
    "the resulting dynamical matrix , given by the second derivatives of the potential with respect to the nuclear coordinates , can be diagonalized thus leading to a set of orthogonal eigenvectors or normal modes @xmath0 , together with the corresponding set of frequencies @xmath1.@xcite    to simulate an infinite crystal , it is customary to apply periodic boundary conditions on the unit cell.@xcite therefore , a crystal described by a basis of @xmath2 atoms in the unit cell is characterized by @xmath3 vibrational bands @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a wave vector in the phonon brillouin zone ( bz ) . within this framework ,",
    "the qha energy at zero temperature , @xmath6 , is defined as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the volume of the system , @xmath9 is the density of states and the integral extends to the brillouin zone .",
    "the first term in the rhs is the ground state energy for the equilibrium configuration at volume @xmath8 .",
    "the second term includes the quantum nature of the nuclei through the harmonic zpe , which also depends on @xmath8 in a way that is characteristic of the type of bonding . for covalent bonding it increases upon compression , while for hydrogen - bonding there is a competition between increasing and decreasing frequencies .",
    "the combination of ground - state and zero - point energies leads to a modified @xmath6 vs. @xmath8 curve  in contrast to @xmath10 vs. @xmath8 , with a minimum located at a volume corrected by quantum nuclear effects .",
    "the qha has the additional advantage of lending itself naturally to the simultaneous incorporation of quantum and thermal effects .",
    "@xcite    in the harmonic approximation the ground state nuclear wave function is a product of single - mode gaussians on the vibrational normal mode variables @xmath0 , and the expectation value of the nuclear coordinates coincides exactly with the classical nuclear configuration .",
    "apart from variations mediated by volume changes , internal structural parameters ( distances and angles ) are unaffected in the qha .",
    "it is then expected that the qha breaks down when treating highly anharmonic systems .",
    "additional terms in the taylor expansion lead to anharmonicity , which can come essentially in two forms .",
    "the simplest one is _",
    "intra - mode _ anharmonicity , when the vibrational modes remain non - interacting but the potential felt by one or more modes can not be approximated by a quadratic expression .",
    "this type can be included in a rather simple way .",
    "normal modes can be used as coordinates to map the pes beyond the harmonic level , and the energy of each mode obtained by solving a set of independent one - dimensional schrdinger equations .",
    "the second type of anharmonicity is due to mode - coupling .",
    "when the excursions along a vibrational normal coordinate are large , the approximation of small oscillations implicit in the second - order expansion breaks down .",
    "successive terms in the expansion involve products of modes of the form @xmath11 as well as higher - order terms involving more than two modes . which groups of modes are more strongly coupled depends very much on the specific system .",
    "in general there are no rules to find out a priori which couplings need to be considered .",
    "a possible strategy is to displace the system along one mode , say @xmath12 , by an amount @xmath13 , and then optimize the atomic coordinates under the constraint @xmath14 . by projecting the displacements obtained for the optimized configuration onto the original normal modes , one can identify and select the modes with the largest projection.@xcite the main goal of this paper is to evaluate the quality of the qha and , where required , to provide improved schemes at an affordable computational cost . to this end",
    ", we will include anharmonicity by solving the vibrational schrdinger equation in a sequence of increasingly accurate approximations , and compare to the qha results .",
    "an additional issue that arises when computing the zpe is that the bz integrals in ( [ e_qha ] ) must be replaced with appropriate averages over a finite set of representative points in the bz .",
    "this can be done in several ways .",
    "the most accurate one is to compute the force constants in real space and then use them to obtain the dynamical matrix at an arbitrarily dense mesh of @xmath5-points in the bz .",
    "this requires calculations in large supercells or , alternatively , linear response calculations .",
    "@xcite on the other extreme , the crudest approximation is to include only the bz - center modes of the unit cell , while improvements can be achieved by considering bz - center modes of larger supercells .",
    "the advantage of this latter is that it is easier to extend to anharmonic situations .",
    "a second goal of this paper is to analyze how large a supercell should be in order to reproduce the equilibrium structure obtained with converged bz averaging .",
    "this issue has rarely been discussed in the literature .    in order to answer these questions",
    "we have studied two qualitatively different models : a one - dimensional monoatomic chain and a diatomic linear chain that models a double - well hydrogen - bonded system . in section [ monoatomic ]",
    "we show that , as usually done in the literature , systems characterized by covalent bonding can be safely described within the quasi - harmonic approximation using a rather coarse bz sampling . in section [ diatomic ] , in contrast , we show that hydrogen - bonded systems require some level of anharmonicity in their treatment .",
    "an anomaly in the zpe appears when the protons center in the h - bonds , upon compression .",
    "this produces an unusual behavior of the qha , which can lead to a secondary spurious minimum in the energy - volume curve .",
    "we then study a realistic linear f - h@xmath15f chain where the pes has been obtained from first - principles calculations ( section [ first_principles ] ) .",
    "we study quantum effects , in particular the isotope effect on equilibrium lattice constant and internal geometry ( h - f distance ) occurring when the nuclear masses are modified ( section [ isotope ] ) . in this case ,",
    "an inexpensive anharmonic approximation that neglects mode - coupling appears to produce an accurate lattice constant . in section [ conclusions ]",
    "we present our conclusions and elaborate on possible extensions . in the following ,",
    "we introduce the theoretical and computational approaches used in the present work .",
    "in this paper we will only consider one - dimensional systems , for the sake of simplicity .",
    "although computationally more demanding , extensions to higher dimensions are straightforward . in the qha ,",
    "the energy for a one - dimensional system containing @xmath2 particles is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the lattice constant  which plays the role of the volume , and @xmath18 is the ground state eletronic energy in the approximation of classical nuclei ( classical energy ) .",
    "the vibrational frequencies @xmath19 are obtained by assuming periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) , i.e. we consider a cyclic chain .",
    "the sum runs up to @xmath20 because the vibrational mode corresponding to the rigid translation of the whole chain has zero frequency .    in the harmonic approximation",
    "there is no need to consider explicitly the @xmath2-atom chain .",
    "the same result can be obtained by studying monoatomic or diatomic cells subject to pbc .",
    "this equivalence is explained thoroughly in most solid state books .",
    "@xcite here we just quote the main result , i.e. the dispersion relations that express the frequency as a function of wavenumber @xmath21 in the one - dimensional phonon brillouin zone . for a monoatomic chain",
    "the dispersion relation is @xmath22 with @xmath23 the mass of the particles , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the quantity @xmath26 is the second derivative ( curvature ) of the interaction potential @xmath8 evaluated at the equilibrium configuration , and depends on the lattice constant @xmath17 .",
    "the frequencies obtained in this way correspond exactly with those of an @xmath2-atom cyclic chain . in the limit of @xmath27 , the qha energy for a monoatomic chain",
    "is @xmath28 the case of a diatomic linear chain is analogous , with the difference that there are two dispersion relations , representing the acoustic and optical branches .",
    "the expressions are still analytic , but slightly more complicated .",
    "@xcite    for a hydrogen - bonded diatomic chain like f - h@xmath15f the harmonic approximation can only be carried out at one of the two equivalent global minima .",
    "if the barrier is so high that tunnelling is unlikely , this is a reasonable approximation .",
    "however , if tunnelling is important , anharmonic effects start to play a significant role and the qha breaks down . by symmetry",
    ", one could also choose a reference configuration at the top of the inversion barrier , i.e. with the h - atoms centered between f - atoms .",
    "this configuration is a stationary point of the pes , but the qha breaks down because a whole portion of the optical phonon branch is unstable around zone - center .",
    "the calculated normal modes can now be used to map the true pes , beyond the harmonic approximation . in general , this is a complicated mutidimensional fitting problem that requires specific techniques such as the product representation @xcite . a much simpler alternative is to keep considering the normal coordinates as non - interacting , but anharmonic .",
    "this corresponds to pure intra - mode anharmonicity .",
    "the full - dimensional vibrational problem is then reduced to mapping the one - dimensional potential for every normal coordinate keeping the other normal coordinates at their classical value , i.e. zero .",
    "then , the 1-d schrdinger equation is solved for each one of these potentials and their ground state energies are added up .",
    "we call this the _ anharmonic _ approximation ( anha ) .    at the other end of the theoretical spectrum",
    ", the problem of interacting phonons can be tackled exactly by solving the @xmath29-dimensional schrdinger equation .",
    "this task can be accomplished with little effort for three degrees of freedom , but finds a hard wall at six .",
    "this means that , in the one - dimensional case , one can routinely compute the exact solution for a 4-atom supercell , but can not go beyond 7-atom chains if a significant fraction of the eigenvalue spectrum is required .",
    "stochastic methods such as diffusion monte carlo can , however , be used to compute the low - energy region of the spectrum , as it has been done for vibrations in molecular systems .",
    "@xcite    here we have chosen the strategy of solving the vibrational schrdinger equation using a discrete variable representation .",
    "we used lagrange grids based on a combination of cartesian and hermite orthogonal polynomials @xcite for double - well and single - well potentials , respectively . when solving the schrdinger equation exactly ,",
    "a maximum of three vibrational degrees of freedom was considered .",
    "this implies that the largest monoatomic linear chain we studied was made of four unit cells , while the largest diatomic chain contained two unit cells .",
    "we have also studied a class of approximations to the full - dimensional solution inspired by the vibrational self - consistent field ( vscf ) method , @xcite which is frequently used to compute vibrational excitation spectra of large molecules .",
    "@xcite in the vscf method the normal coordinates are taken as completely uncorrelated and the total wave function is written as a product of single - mode wave functions : @xmath30 in the same spirit of the hartree approximation to the problem of interacting electrons .",
    "contrary to the harmonic and anharmonic approximations , each mode now feels the presence of the other modes , but in a mean - field way .",
    "the vscf equations are @xmath31\\phi_i(\\zeta_i)= \\epsilon_i\\,\\phi_i(\\zeta_i)~~,\\ ] ] where @xmath32 are the mean - field potentials for each mode .",
    "for a 1-d system the energy in the vscf method is given by @xmath33 where the second term corrects for double - counting in the sum of eigenvalues .",
    "notice that the integral in this term should be independent of @xmath34 , within numerical accuracy .",
    "the determination of the mean - field potential requires the computation of @xmath35-dimensional integrals , which rapidly becomes an expensive operation .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to find either simpler approximations or some way of evaluating these integrals at a reduced computational cost .",
    "the _ anharmonic _",
    "approximation ( anha ) mentioned above removes this limitation by replacing the single - mode densities @xmath36 in ( [ pot_vscf ] ) with delta - functions centered at @xmath37 . with this",
    ", the anha can be carried onto much larger systems .",
    "the quality of the vscf results depends on the choice of coordinates .",
    "if the system is only weakly anharmonic , then the classical normal modes are a very reasonable choice .",
    "this is not necessarily the case when anharmonicity becomes important .",
    "the question arises of whether it is still possible to find a set of orthogonal coordinates that are only weakly correlated , or whether correlation is intrinsic to the problem and can not be significantly reduced by a clever choice of coordinates . within the vscf context ,",
    "finding the optimally de - correlated coordinates is equivalent to requiring that these minimize @xmath38 .",
    "the optimal coordinates @xmath39 can be obtained by solving the vscf problem for a linear combination of normal modes @xmath40 , and minimising @xmath38 with respect to the coefficients @xmath41 of the rotation matrix , subject to orthonormality constraints .",
    "@xcite this task can be accomplished by constrained multidimensional optimisation algorithms .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , there is no clear evidence of a general method for obtaining the optimal set of coordinates . in this work",
    "we analyze the quality of the vscf approximation with respect to the choice of vibrational coordinates for the ab initio hydrogen - bonded linear chain .",
    "we first considered a periodic monoatomic chain where the atoms interact via a morse potential of the form @xmath42 where parameter @xmath43 represents the binding energy of a dimer , @xmath44 is the location of the minimum of the potential , which corresponds to the classical lattice constant , and @xmath45 is a parameter that determines the curvature of the potential through the relation @xmath46 .",
    "the morse potential is intrinsically anharmonic , and allows us to study the effect of quantization of the vibrations on the lattice constant . for the various approximations described in the previous section we calculated the quantum - corrected energy as a function of the lattice parameter @xmath17 , and then determined the minimum of the @xmath47 vs. @xmath17 curve .    in the solution of schrdinger s equation",
    ", the extent of quantum nuclear effects can be measured by the product @xmath48 , with @xmath23 the mass of the particles and @xmath43 the energy scale of the potential .",
    "small values of @xmath49 lead to important quantum effects , becoming less relevant as @xmath49 increases , and eventually converging towards the classical results for @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , we report our results in terms of this quantity . in this work",
    "we have used @xmath51 bohr and @xmath52 bohr@xmath53 .",
    "we first analyzed the effect of brillouin zone sampling on the equilibrium lattice constant .",
    "for the qha this can be done for an arbitrarily large number @xmath2 of k - points in the bz , which is equivalent to considering a supercell containing an equal number @xmath2 of unit cells . in fig .",
    "[ a_vs_m_mon ] we show the convergence pattern of the qha lattice constant as a function of @xmath49 , for increasing values of @xmath2 .    ,",

    "the dashed horizontal line represents the classical value . ]",
    "it is obvious that quantum effects are more important for smaller masses and for weaker interaction potentials . for h - atoms and @xmath59 ev ( @xmath60 a.u .",
    ") we are in the region to the left of fig.[a_vs_m_mon ] , where the quantum - corrected lattice constant is about 4% larger than the classical value ( horizontal line ) .",
    "it can be seen that , for this type of potential , 10 cells are already sufficient to reproduce the infinite crystal lattice constant to high accuracy .",
    "however , 4 cells already produce excellent results and 2 cells underestimate @xmath17 in less that 1% .    in order to illustrate the origin of the lattice expansion , we show in fig .",
    "[ zpe_harmonic_vs_a_monoatomic ] the various energy curves for a 4-atom supercell , as a function of the lattice parameter for @xmath49=304.97 a.u .",
    "the classical energy curve @xmath18 ( black , solid line ) exhibits a minimum at the equilibrium lattice constant , where the one - dimensional pressure , @xmath61 , vanishes .",
    "the zpe ( red , dot - dashed line ) depends on the lattice constant through the curvature of the potential . upon compression ( reducing @xmath17 ) ,",
    "the chain becomes stiffer , all frequencies increase and so does the zpe .",
    "therefore , the qha energy given by the sum of the two terms in ( [ e_qha_1d ] ) , and represented by the blue , dashed curve , exhibits a minimum at an expanded lattice constant .",
    "this effect is similar to thermal expansion , but the origin is purely quantum - mechanical .",
    "it can also be ascribed to a zero - point pressure originated in the dependence of the zpe on the lattice constant .",
    "= 304.97 a.u . since the zpe increases as @xmath17 decreases ( red , dot - dashed line ) , the qha lattice parameter ( vertical dashed line ) corresponding to the minimum of the qha energy curve ( blue , dashed ) , is expanded .",

    "the black solid curve is for the anha , the red ( dot - dashed ) for the vscf , and the blue ( long - dashed ) for the exact calculation . ]    to evaluate the quality of the qha we calculated the equilibrium lattice constant in the anha and vscf approximations , and exactly for a 4-atom supercell .",
    "the differences between these results and the qha lattice parameter , @xmath62 , are reported in fig .",
    "[ comp_meth_mon ] .",
    "it can be seen that these differences are one order of magnitude smaller than those arising from a poor sampling of the bz .",
    "thes observations justify the approach commonly used to determine the quantum - corrected lattice constant of solids , i.e. that of computing the harmonic zpe for a coarse bz sampling  preferably only the @xmath63-point  , adding it to the electronic ground state energy corresponding to the equilibrium configuration , and obtaining the lattice constant as the minimum of the sum . as we shall see now , however , this procedure is not necessarily useful for very anharmonic systems such as hydrogen - bonded crystals .      as an extension to highly anharmonic systems , we considered a model for a hydrogen - bonded diatomic chain where the light atoms are generally hydrogens , and the heavy atoms can be oxygen or fluorine . for the sake of simplicity , and to be consistent with the following section , we call them h and f , respectively . for the f - h potential",
    "we retain a morse - type of interaction ( eq .",
    "[ morse ] ) . for sufficiently large f - f distances",
    "the h atoms feel attracted to one or the other f - atom , rather than being shared between them .",
    "therefore , the h - atoms in the chain are subject to a double - well potential .",
    "this potential has an important property for what concerns isotope effects : the barrier between the two wells becomes lower when the two neighbouring f - atoms approach each other .",
    "this is an essential ingredient , which allows for an easier migration of the protons upon compression .",
    "the f displacements ( @xmath64 ) are measured from the given lattice parameter . on the other hand , the h displacements ( @xmath65 )",
    "are measured from the midpoint between the equilibrium positions of the f - atoms .",
    "displacements @xmath64 and @xmath65 are continuous variables associated to discrete lattice sites @xmath34 . with this ,",
    "the double morse contribution to the pes is @xmath66 where @xmath2 is the number of sites and @xmath17 is the lattice parameter .",
    "the potential parameters are the well depth @xmath43 and the position of the minima @xmath67 , measured from the f - atoms .",
    "the effects of periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) are included in the last term on the rhs .",
    "when the h - atom sits off - center it forms a neutral unit with the f - atom , and another h - atom on the opposite side of the f is not welcome due to electronic closed - shell repulsion effects .",
    "a similar effect occurs in ice , where oxygens make two strong covalent bonds with h - atoms to form the water molecules , and two weaker hydrogen bonds with neighboring molecules .",
    "this , however , is not taken into account by the morse potential . to introduce this feature , usually known as pauling s  ice - rules",
    "\" , it is necessary to include an interaction between the h - atoms that discourages them from approaching the same f - atom .",
    "there are several possible ways of doing this .",
    "a popular choice is to include a harmonic interaction between h - atoms .",
    "the h - h contribution to the pes is @xmath68 where the last term takes care of pbc .",
    "this potential encourages adjacent h - atoms to move the same amount in the same direction , thus promoting the ice rules .",
    "the larger the constant @xmath69 , the more effectively these are respected . a similar term is included for the f - atoms @xmath70 with the corresponding pbc .",
    "this potential favors the f - atoms to move in the same direction so that two f - atoms can not approach the same h at once .",
    "this model has been taken from a work by yanovitskii et al , @xcite who studied the phase diagram in the self - consistent harmonic approximation for a o - h@xmath15o linear chain .",
    "the only difference with respect to yanovitskii s model is the value of the harmonic constant @xmath69 ( 0.06413 instead of 0.01413 a.u . ) .",
    "this modification was necessary because the original value did not enforce the ice rules strongly enough , thus leading to a potential with quite unrealistic features such as unstable acoustic phonon branches , as shown in a preliminary version of this work .",
    "@xcite    this model assumes that the h - h and the f - f interactions are independent of the lattice parameter @xmath17 .",
    "a mild dependence on the lattice constant enters through the h - f interaction , but it is quite unrealistic .",
    "in order to render quantum effects more realistic we have introduced an additional morse - type potential @xmath71 the parameters used in the present work were inspired in the calculations presented in the following section , and are summarized in table [ param ] . with this choice of parameters , the classical lattice constant is @xmath72 bohr . in fig .",

    "the classical f - h distance increases by a substantial 10% when the true h and f masses are used .",
    "in contrast , at fixed lattice constant the qha values are insensitive to @xmath73 .",
    "this is because quantum and classical harmonic oscillators have the same equilibrium position , and thus the quantum harmonic approximation does not modify the internal geometry .",
    "more generally , the f - h distance in the qha corresponds to the classical value obtained at the @xmath73-dependent equilibrium lattice constant , which is reported in the inset to fig .",
    "[ isot_hf ] ( red symbols ) .",
    "therefore , the influence of mass - scaling is limited to the _ volume _ effect , which is significantly smaller than the full quantum effect .",
    "firstly , the dependence of the qha lattice constant with @xmath73 is milder than the exact one . secondly , as shown in fig .",
    "[ pot_fe_hf ] , variations of this magnitude lead to small changes in the location of the minima of the double - well . as a consequence , the f - h distance is severely underestimated in the qha , thus precluding its use in the description of the internal geometry of h - bonded systems .    in the present case , the isotope effect upon doubling of all the masses , which is closely related to deuteration , does not entail a significant change in the f - h distance . in a first instance",
    "one could think that this is because it was calculated at fixed lattice constant ( see table [ d_fh_vs_s ] ) . in effect , this would be consistent with theoretical calculations @xcite and experiments under pressure . @xcite when sufficient pressure is applied to deuterated compounds to reproduce the lattice parameters of its protonated analogue , the internal geometries turn out to be quite similar . within this context",
    ", one of us has shown that most of the isotope effect arises from a self - consistent interplay between wave function localization , internal geometry and lattice parameters .",
    "@xcite therefore , to assess the full extent of the isotope effect one would have to compare the internal geometries at the corresponding equilibrium lattice constants . in the present case we obtained f - h distances of 2.12 and 2.10 bohr , respectively",
    "interestingly , the isotope effect remains as small as before .",
    "this is not inconsistent with experimental data , though .",
    "in fact , the magnitude of the isotope effect on inter - atomic distances in hydrogen - bonded systems ranges from almost insignificant values for some systems , to large differences as in kdp , where the o - h distance of 2.45   rises to 2.52   in its deuterated analogue dkdp .",
    "@xcite this depends on several factors , mainly the size of the coupling between internal coordinates and strain and the shape of the double - well ( barrier height and distance between minima ) in the region around the equilibrium lattice constant .",
    "we have analyzed the influence of quantum nuclear effects on the structural properties of solids . to this end",
    "we have implemented a simple methodology of mapping the multidimensional pes in the space of normal modes , and then solving the resulting vibrational schrdinger equation .",
    "this has been done exactly when possible , and also using a number of computationally tractable approximations that range from the vibrational self - consistent field ( vscf ) method and its variants , down to the quasi - harmonic approximation ( qha ) .",
    "we have studied the behaviour of energies and lattice constants in an anharmonic monoatomic chain as a function of the size of the supercell , and showed that results for four cells are probably already quite close to convergence . here",
    ", the qha is an excellent approximation unless the masses become exceedingly small , thus justifying the customary approach followed in solid - state physics .",
    "we have then analyzed the behaviour of a model hydrogen - bonded chain , and observed that the coupling between modes can be important .",
    "finally , we considered a realistic h - bonded chain where the pes was determined from first - principles calculations .",
    "here we obtained the quantum - corrected lattice constant and internal structural parameters ( distances ) , and showed how isotope effects arise in these systems .",
    "we have also analyzed the various approximations and showed that the qha is insufficient , while the independent - mode anharmonic approximation anha appears to introduce an important improvement at the energetic and structural level .",
    "nevertheless , results obtained for the model hydrogen - bonded chain suggest that this may be accidental and due to size effects .",
    "vscf results are very close to exact ones , thus suggesting that correlation between modes is a minor effect .",
    "optimizing the vibrational coordinates in the vscf method does not constitute a significant advantage ; further improvement should arise from correlated methods such as vibrational ci or mctdh . in any case , the vscf approach using the modes calculated at the classical equilibrium geometry appears to be a very good approximation .    although technically the extension to higher dimensionalities is straightforward , there are some features that are not present in one - dimensional systems .",
    "for example , the tunneling mode can be strongly coupled to other modes @xcite so that , for large amplitude of motion , correlation between them may become important . in this case",
    "we enter the realm of multi - dimensional tunneling where , if we insist on describing the proton motion in terms of a single , effective tunneling coordinate , this latter tends to be curvilinear .",
    "therefore , it is quite likely to have to adopt schemes that combine the exact solution for one or a few subspaces of strongly coupled modes , with a vscf representation or a lower - level scheme such as the qha for the remaining modes .",
    "@xcite it remains the problem of identifying which are those subspaces , though .",
    "there are many aspects of this approach that can be improved , especially for what concerns simplified methods that can be used for larger systems and higher dimensionality . within the vscf scheme ,",
    "the limiting factor is the mapping of the pes and the multi - dimensional integration .",
    "the latter can be efficiently dealt with by factorizing the pes into a sum of products of modes .",
    "@xcite this allows for the computation of vscf potentials as products of inexpensive one - dimensional integrals .",
    "the problem of fitting the pes remains open , although there are general strategies for pes fitting based on interpolation methods , @xcite or using principles of multivariate analysis such as the high - dimensional model representation of rabitz and ali .",
    "@xcite an improvement to the anha that approximately recovers the interaction between modes at the mean - field level consists of using the quantum expectation value of the geometry as a reference , rather than the classical one .",
    "this can also be seen as a simplification of the vscf approximation where the vibrational wave functions in the integrals are replaced by completely localized delta - functions .",
    "this is a good approximation unless one or more approximated wave functions exhibit two peaks corresponding to a double - well potential .",
    "another subtle issue in hydrogen - bonded systems is that , although dft - gga approaches reproduce structural properties quite well , proton transfer barriers appear to be exceedingly small , in some cases even disappearing altogether .",
    "@xcite therefore , other electronic structure methods such as hybrid hartree - fock - dft @xcite or correlated quantum chemical methods have to be explored .",
    "@xcite    a straightforward extension of this methodology is the calculation of vibrational excitations . once the pes is known , excited states can be easily calculated and used to compute thermodynamic quantities beyond the quasi - harmonic approximation .",
    "general vscf algorithms useful to tackle mild anharmonicities in molecular systems have been implemented many years ago , @xcite and more recently in conjunction with an ab initio description of the pes .",

    "<S> we study the structural effects produced by the quantization of vibrational degrees of freedom in periodic crystals at zero temperature . to this end </S>",

    "<S> a number of increasingly accurate approximations ranging from the quasi - harmonic approximation ( qha ) to the vibrational self - consistent field ( vscf ) method and the exact solution are described . </S>",
    "<S> a thorough analysis of the approximations is presented for model monoatomic and hydrogen - bonded chains , and results are presented for a linear hf chain where the potential energy surface is obtained via first - principles electronic structure calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on quantum nuclear effects on the lattice constant , and show that the vscf is an excellent approximation , meaning that correlation between modes is not extremely important . </S>",
    "<S> the qha is excellent for covalently - bonded , mildly anharmonic systems , but it fails for hydrogen - bonded ones . in the latter , </S>",
    "<S> the zero - point energy exhibits a non - analytic behavior at the lattice constant where the h - atoms center , which leads to a spurious secondary minimum in the quantum - corrected energy curve . an inexpensive anharmonic appoximation of non - interacting modes appears to produce rather good results for hydrogen - bonded chains , for small system sizes . </S>",
    "<S> however , it converges to the incorrect qha results for increasing size . </S>",
    "<S> isotope effects are studied for the first - principles hf chain . </S>",
    "<S> we show how the lattice constant and the hf distance increase with decreasing mass , and how the qha proves to be insufficient to reproduce this behavior . </S>"
