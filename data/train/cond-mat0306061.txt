    "in this article , we investigate the properties of a simple model of opinion formation .",
    "the model consists of @xmath9 agents , each of which can assume one of two opinion states of @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "these agents evolve according to the following rules ( fig .  [ update ] ) :    * pick a group of @xmath12 agents ( spins ) from the system , with @xmath12 an odd number .",
    "this group could be any @xmath12 spins in the mean - field limit , or it could be a randomly - chosen contiguous cluster of spins in finite - dimensional systems . * with probability @xmath0 , the spins in the group",
    "all adopt the state of the local majority .",
    "with probability @xmath1 , the spins all adopt the state of the local minority .",
    "* repeat the group selection and attendant spin update until the system necessarily reaches a final state of consensus .",
    "we term this process the _ majority - minority model _ ( mm ) , in keeping with the feature that evolution can be controlled either by the local majority or the local minority .",
    "the mm model represents a natural outgrowth of recent analytical work on the _ majority rule _ model of opinion formation @xcite , which , in turn , represents a particular limit of a class of models introduced by galam @xcite . in majority rule",
    ", the opinion evolution of any group is controlled only by the local majority within that group .",
    "thus majority rule corresponds to the @xmath13 limit of the present mm model .",
    "a basic motivation for this type of modeling is to incorporate , within a minimalist description , some realistic aspects of the manner in which members of an interactive population form consensus on some issue . in this spirit , the mm model allows for the possibility that a forceful and/or charismatic minority can sometimes dominate the opinion of a group , an experience that many of us have had in our everyday lives .",
    "the limit where @xmath0 is close to 1 is probably closer to socially realistic situations .",
    "part of our interest in consider the case of general @xmath0 is to understand the change in dynamics as a function of @xmath0 and the kinetic phase transition that occurs at @xmath8 .",
    "we shall see that the interplay between minority and majority rule leads to three distinct kinetic phases in which the approach to ultimate consensus is governed by different mechanisms . as in the earlier work on majority rule @xcite",
    ", we seek to understand the long - time opinion evolution .",
    "we will be primarily concerned with determining the probability of reaching a given final state ( the exit probability ) as a function of @xmath0 and the initial densities of each opinion state .",
    "spins according to mm dynamics .",
    "majority rule applies with probability @xmath0 and minority rule applies with probability @xmath1.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    to provide perspective for this paper , we briefly review related work on opinion dynamics models . perhaps the simplest such example in this spirit is the classical voter model @xcite . here",
    "a 2-state spin is selected at random and it adopts the opinion of a randomly - chosen neighbor .",
    "this step is repeated until a finite system necessarily reaches consensus .",
    "one can think of each spin as an agent with zero self confidence who merely adopts the state of one of its neighbors .",
    "an attractive feature of the voter model ( in contrast to the familiar ising model with glauber kinetics @xcite ) is that it is exactly soluble in all spatial dimensions . for a finite system of @xmath9 spins in @xmath14 dimensions , the time to reach consensus scales as @xmath9 for @xmath15 , as @xmath16 for @xmath17 ( the critical dimension of the voter model ) , and as @xmath18 in @xmath19 @xcite . in @xmath19 and 2 ,",
    "an infinite system coarsens so that consensus emerges on progressively larger length scales , while for @xmath15 , an infinite system approaches a steady state of mixed opinions . because the average magnetization is conserved @xcite , the probability that the system eventually ends with all plus spins equals the initial density of plus spins in all spatial dimensions .    from a more practically - minded viewpoint",
    ", there has been a recent upsurge of interest in kinetic spin - based statistical physics models that attempt to incorporate some realistic sociological features .",
    "one such example is galam s rumor formation model @xcite , in which a population is partitioned into variable - sized groups , and in each update step the spins in each group may adopt the majority state or the minority state of the group depending on additional interactions .",
    "our majority model represents a special case in which only a single group of fixed size @xmath12 is updated at each step .",
    "another prominent example is the sznajd model , where spins evolve only when local regions of consensus exist @xcite . in the basic version of the model , when two neighboring spins are in the same state , this local consensus persuades a neighboring spin to join in .",
    "such a rule naturally leads to eventual global consensus except in the anomalous case of an antiferromagnetic initial state .",
    "the generic questions posed above about opinion evolution in the mm model are also of basic interest in the sznajd model @xcite and considerable work has recently appeared to quantify its basic properties @xcite .",
    "there is also a wide variety of kinetic spin models of social interactions that incorporate , for example , multiple traits @xcite , incompatibility @xcite , and other relevant features @xcite .",
    "a new feature of our mm model is that the competition between majority and minority rule leads to a kinetic phase transition in all spatial dimensions @xmath14 at a critical value of @xmath20 for group size @xmath2 .",
    "the existence of such a transition can be easily understood by considering the average change of the magnetization in a single update step .",
    "a group undergoing an update must consist of 2 spins of one sign and a single spin of the opposite sign . according to fig .",
    "[ update ] , the magnetization change in such a group is proportional to @xmath21 , which is zero when @xmath22 . for @xmath4 and for all @xmath23",
    ", the system quickly evolves toward global consensus where the magnetization equals @xmath24 @xcite . for @xmath6 ,",
    "the average magnetization is conserved , as in the voter model .",
    "consensus is again always reached , but the time until consensus grows as a power law in time . for @xmath5 ,",
    "the system is driven toward a state with equal densities for the two species of agents .",
    "since consensus is still the only absorbing state of the dynamics , consensus is eventually reached in a finite system , but the time needed grows exponentially with the system size .",
    "it bears emphasizing that for all @xmath0 and for all @xmath14 , a finite - size system necessarily reaches consensus in the mm model .",
    "there are no metastable states that prevent the attainment of ultimate consensus as in the related majority vote process @xcite or in the zero - temperature ising model with glauber kinetics @xcite .",
    "the mm model exhibits special behavior in one dimension in which the magnetization quickly approaches a static value that depends only on the initial magnetization . if one focuses on the interfaces between domains of agents in the same state , these domain wall particles undergo the diffusive annihilation reaction @xmath25 , but with constraints in the motion of domain walls , when they are nearby , that reflect the constraints of the mm dynamical rules .",
    "our understanding of this intriguing aspect of the problem is still incomplete .    in sec .",
    "ii , we investigate the exit probability and exit times in the mean - field limit of the mm model .",
    "we then turn to the case of one dimension in sec .",
    "we first write the master equation for the configurational probability distribution , following the original glauber formalism .",
    "we apply a kirkwood decoupling scheme @xcite for correlation functions to compute the final magnetization as a function of the initial magnetization .",
    "finally , we show that in the exactly solvable case of @xmath26 , the 2-spin correlation function @xmath27 approaches one as @xmath28 for all @xmath29 .",
    "thus the system exhibits diffusive coarsening , as in the traditional voter model .",
    "we give a summary and discussion in sec .",
    "calculational details are given in the appendices .",
    "following the approach developed in @xcite , we first study the exit probability @xmath30 , namely , the probability that a system that initially contains @xmath31 up spins in a system of @xmath9 total spins ends with all spins up .",
    "this exit probability obeys a simple recursion relation in which @xmath30 can be expressed in terms of the exit probabilities after one step of the mm process @xcite .    to construct this recursion relation",
    ", we note that @xmath32 are the respective probabilities that a group of 3 spins contains 2 plus and 1 minus spins or contains 1 plus and 2 minus spins , and that the majority rule is applied to the group .",
    "thus @xmath33 is the probability that there is a change @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the probability that there is a change @xmath36 in a single step of the mm process .",
    "similarly @xmath37 with @xmath38 , are the respective probabilities for @xmath31 to change by @xmath39 steps due to minority rule being applied to the group .",
    "the master equation for the exit probability is @xcite @xmath40     that a finite system with initial magnetization @xmath41 ends with all spins plus for @xmath42 ( solid ) , @xmath6 ( dashed ) , and @xmath5 ( dotted ) .",
    "also indicated is the @xmath9 dependence of the deviation of the first and last curves from a step function.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    while the exact solution to this discrete recursion relation was given in @xcite ( for @xmath13 ) , it is much simpler to consider the continuum limit of @xmath43 with @xmath44 finite . in this limit",
    ", the hopping probabilities reduce to @xmath45 and after some straightforward steps , the continuum version of the master equation simplifies to @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the magnetization and the prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath41 .",
    "this equation can be easily integrated and the final result is @xmath48 where @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath51 versus @xmath41 is sketched in fig .",
    "[ e - sketch ] and it merely represents the continuum version of the corresponding result given in ref .  @xcite . for @xmath4 ,",
    "the exit probability approaches a step function as @xmath52 with a characteristic width that scales as @xmath53 .",
    "this feature reflects the fact that when @xmath54 , the hopping process underlying the exit probability is controlled by the global bias .",
    "conversely , for @xmath5 , the exit probability approaches 1/2 for nearly all initial values of @xmath41 except for a thin region of width @xmath55 about @xmath56 .",
    "this reflects the fact that minority rule tends to drive the system toward zero magnetization .",
    "thus the exit probability is independent of the initial state unless the system begins at an exponentially small distance ( in @xmath9 ) from consensus .",
    "the average magnetization also obeys a simple rate equation in the continuum limit . with probability @xmath57 , where @xmath44 , a group of 3 consists of 2 plus spins and 1 minus spin .",
    "if this group is picked , then majority rule applies with probability @xmath0 and the magnetization increases by 2 , while with probability @xmath58 , the magnetization decreases by 4 .",
    "a complementary reasoning applies to a group with 2 minus spins and 1 plus spin .",
    "thus the rate equation for the magnetization is @xmath59 where again @xmath47 .",
    "this approximate equation becomes an exact description in the limit @xmath52 .",
    "the long - time solution is @xmath60 e^{-36(p - p_c)t}\\right\\ } } & { \\displaystyle p > p_c},\\\\ \\\\ { \\displaystyle m(0 ) } & { \\displaystyle p = p_c},\\\\ \\\\ { \\displaystyle \\frac{m(0)}{\\sqrt{1-m^{2}(0)}}\\ , e^{-18(p_c - p)t } } & { \\displaystyle p < p_c } , \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where in the first line , the @xmath61 sign occurs if @xmath62 or @xmath63 respectively .    for @xmath4 , majority rule prevails and the dynamics",
    "is essentially the same as in the original majority rule model @xcite .",
    "the approach to the asymptotic behavior is exponential in time with a relaxation time @xmath64^{-1}$ ] .",
    "this corresponds to an exit time that scales logarithmically in the system size .",
    "conversely , when @xmath5 the dynamics is dominated by the rule of the minority so that the asymptotic magnetization vanishes ( for @xmath65 ) .",
    "the approach towards this steady state is again exponential , but with a relaxation time @xmath66^{-1}$ ] that is twice as large as @xmath67 . in spite of the bias away from consensus , this state is necessarily reached in a finite system , because this is the only absorbing state of the dynamics , but the time required to reach consensus grows exponentially in the system size .",
    "finally , at the critical point @xmath3 , the average magnetization remains invariant , as in the voter model @xcite .",
    "in one dimension , the original formalism of the ising - glauber model @xcite can be exploited to obtain the equation of motion for the magnetization , as well as that for higher - order spin correlation functions .",
    "we consider only the simplest case of group size equal to three and denote the spins in a group , that can take the values @xmath24 , by @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70",
    ". then the rate at which spin @xmath68 flips according to majority rule is @xcite , @xmath71 this rate expresses the fact that @xmath69 and @xmath70 must be equal but opposite to @xmath68 for spin @xmath68 to flip .",
    "conveniently , this same expression also gives the rate at which the spins @xmath69 and @xmath70 flip according to minority rule dynamics .",
    "thus for minority rule the spin - flip rate @xmath72 .    first consider majority rule dynamics . in this case",
    "a given spin @xmath73 belongs to the three groups @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 .",
    "this then leads to the total flip rate @xcite @xmath77.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on the other hand , for minority rule , the spin - flip rates are @xmath78    the kinetics of the system is described by the master equation for the probability distribution for a given spin configuration @xmath79 . the derivation of this master equation is standard but tedious and the details are given in appendix a. from the master equation , we can then compute the rate equation for the magnetization ( eq .  ( [ eqmagn ] ) ) .",
    "for the present discussion , we only study a spatially homogeneous system . in this case",
    "( [ eqmagn ] ) simplifies considerably and the resulting rate equation is @xmath80 with the magnetization @xmath81 written as the first moment of the spin expectation value , and @xmath82 is the 3-spin correlation function .",
    "notice that this equation has a very similar structure to eq .",
    "( [ magnmf ] ) , the mean - field equation for the magnetization .",
    "in fact , eq .  ( [ eqmagn1 ] ) reduces to ( [ magnmf ] ) if we neglect fluctuations and assume that @xmath83 . from eq .",
    "( [ eqmagn1 ] ) , we deduce several basic facts :    * for @xmath26 and @xmath84 , the magnetization is conserved . this conservation ,",
    "valid in all spatial dimension , relies on the fact that the group size equals 3 .",
    "thus at @xmath8 we expect kinetics similar to that in the classical voter model .",
    "* for any @xmath0 , a system that is initially in consensus ( @xmath85 ) or a system with zero initial magnetization @xmath86 ) does not evolve .",
    "that is , @xmath87 in the former case and @xmath88 in * the magnetization is generally _ not _ conserved , except for the initial state @xmath89 or @xmath24 .",
    "this non - conservation leads to unusual kinetics of the interfaces between regions of plus and minus spins .",
    "while these domain walls diffuse if they are widely separated , mm dynamics leads to additional interactions between walls when their distance is less than or equal to 2 . * for @xmath90 , the equation for the magnetization is not closed but involves the 3-spin correlation function . in turn ,",
    "the equation for this correlation function involves higher - order correlations , thus giving rise to an insoluble , infinite equation hierarchy .    to make analytical progress for the behavior of the magnetization in one dimension",
    ", we need to truncate this equation hierarchy . in the next section",
    ", we implement such a truncation within the kirkwood approximation scheme .",
    "we now study the behavior of the magnetization in one dimension .",
    "contrary to the case of spatial dimension @xmath91 , the magnetization quickly approaches a saturation value that has a smooth and non - trivial dependence on @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "we implement a kirkwood decoupling scheme to the exact master equation to obtain the mean magnetization @xmath93 .",
    "we shall see that this uncontrolled approximation gives surprisingly accurate results .",
    "our approach is based on writing the exact equation of motion for @xmath94 and then , in the spirit of the kirkwood approximation @xcite , factorizing the 4-point functions that appear in this equation as products of 2-point functions .",
    "such an approach has proven quite successful in a variety of applications to reaction kinetics @xcite . by solving the resulting nonlinear but closed equation",
    ", we obtain an approximate expression for @xmath95 . then in eq .",
    "( [ eqmagn1 ] ) for the magnetization , we factorize the 3-point function @xmath96 as @xmath97 ( instead of @xmath98 as in the usual mean - field analysis ) .",
    "we now determine the equation of motion for the correlation function @xmath95 from the master equation ( [ master ] ) .",
    "following the same steps as those followed to find the equation for the mean magnetization , we find , after a number of straightforward steps ( see appendix  b ) , @xmath99\\nonumber\\\\ & + & 4(2 - 3p ) \\ , m_4,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the shorthand notations ( for a translationally invariant system ) @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "in general , we reserve the notation @xmath102 to denote the average value of a chain of @xmath103 contiguous spins and @xmath104 for the correlation function between two spins that are separated by a distance @xmath29 .",
    "thus when the separation between the two spins equals one , we have that @xmath105 .    in spite of the fact that eq .",
    "( [ c1mmm ] ) is exact , the 2-spin correlation function @xmath106 is coupled to higher - order correlations and it is therefore difficult to compute these quantities exactly .",
    "however at @xmath107 , this equation is closed in that it involves 2-spin correlation functions only ( see sec .",

    "this exit probability changes abruptly from @xmath11 for initial magnetization @xmath63 to @xmath10 for @xmath197 .",
    "conversely , for @xmath5 , this exit probability is 1/2 for almost all @xmath198 .",
    "these behaviors reflect the inherent biases of majority and minority rule .    in one dimension ,",
    "the magnetization quickly approaches a fixed value that depends only on the initial magnetization .",
    "this then immediately determines the exit probability . within a kirkwood decoupling scheme for the infinite hierarchy of equations for correlation functions",
    ", we obtained a reasonable approximation for the dependence of the final magnetization ( equivalently the exit probability ) on the initial magnetization .",
    "it is worth noting that other decoupling schemes can also be applied .",
    "one such example is the so - called `` simple method '' @xcite , where the 3- and 4-point correlation functions are decoupled according to @xmath199 and @xmath200 .",
    "while this approach sometimes gives superior results to the kirkwood scheme @xcite , this approach turns out to be ill suited to determining the initial density dependence of the final magnetization in one dimension .    at the critical point of @xmath124",
    ", we obtained the exact 2-spin correlation function and showed that it exhibits the same @xmath192 coarsening as in the classical voter model .",
    "although the 2-spin correlation function has the same behavior as in the voter model , it is possible that two - time correlation functions , such as @xmath201 , or quantities related to persistence phenomena , will give behavior different that the voter model .",
    "we would like to suggest several directions for further research .",
    "first , it would be worthwhile to understand the mm model in finite spatial dimensions strictly greater than one .",
    "in the special case where the majority exclusively rules ( @xmath13 ) , numerical evidence suggested that the upper critical dimension of the system is greater than four @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the upper critical dimension for the voter model equals two and this appears to coincide with the behavior of the mm model for @xmath6 .",
    "it should be instructive to understand the nature of the crossover between these two behaviors .",
    "another question involves the dependence of the kinetics on the group size . for group size @xmath202 , a sharp transition between majority - dominated and minority - dominated kinetics can be engineered by the following somewhat baroque construction .",
    "for a group that contains @xmath203 plus spins and @xmath204 minus spins , apply majority rule with probability @xmath205 and minority rule with probability @xmath206 .",
    "it is easy to verify that this rule gives zero net magnetization change in each elemental group update .",
    "thus this construction should lead to kinetics similar to that of the voter model .",
    "however , in the more natural situation where the probabilities of applying the majority or minority rules are independent of group composition , we do not yet understand the nature of the change between majority - dominated and minority - dominated dynamics .",
    "the kinetics in one dimension presents an intriguing challenge . within the glauber formalism",
    ", the mm model appears to be insoluble because correlation functions of different orders are coupled in the equations of motion .",
    "however , the evolution of interfaces between domain walls obeys relatively simple kinetics that closely resembles the diffusion - limited reaction @xmath207 . for the mm model",
    ", it is easy to see that , in addition to diffusion of domain walls , there are specific constraints in their motion when domain walls are either nearest - neighbor or next - nearest - neighbor . in spite of these complications , we would hope that this model is exactly soluble in one dimension .",
    "finally , it should be worthwhile to extend the model to allow for agents that have an intrinsic identity . in the mm model , the state of an agent",
    "is determined only by the local environment .",
    "however , it is much more realistic for individuals to inherently prefer one of the two states so that the transition rates depend both on this factor , as well as on the state of its neighbors .",
    "this seems a natural step to bring the mm model a bit closer to political reality .",
