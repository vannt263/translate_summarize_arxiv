    "capillary waves represent a conceptual problem for the interpretation of the properties of liquid - liquid or liquid - vapor planar interfaces , because long - wave fluctuations are smearing the density profile across the interface and all other quantities associated to it .",
    "this is usually overcome by calculating the density profile using a local , instantaneous reference frame located at the interface , commonly referred to as the intrinsic density profile , @xmath1 , where ( @xmath2,@xmath3,@xmath4 ) is the position of the @xmath5-th atom or molecule , and the local elevation of the surface is @xmath6 , assuming the macroscopic surface normal being aligned with the z axis of a simulation box with cross section area @xmath7 . during the last decade",
    "several numerical methods have been proposed to compute the intrinsic density profiles at interfaces@xcite . despite several differences in these approaches , they are , in general , providing consistent distributions of interfacial atoms or molecules@xcite and density profiles@xcite . among these methods ,",
    "itim @xcite proved to be an excellent compromise between computational cost and accuracy@xcite , but it is limited to macroscopically flat interfaces , therefore there is a need to generalize it to arbitrary interfacial shapes .",
    "before these works , albeit for other purposes , several surface - recognition algorithms have been devised , and will be briefly mentioned below .",
    "all of them are possible starting points for the sought generalization under the condition that , once applied to the special case of a planar interface , they lead to consistent results with existing algorithms for the determination of intrinsic profiles .",
    "historically , the first class of algorithms addressing the problem of identifying surfaces was developed to determine molecular areas and volumes .",
    "the study of solvation properties of molecules and macromolecules ( usually , proteins ) might require the identification of molecular pockets , or the calculation of the solvent - accessible surface area for implicit solvation models@xcite .",
    "two intuitive concepts are commonly used to describe the surface properties of molecules , namely , that of solvent - accessible surface@xcite ( sas ) , and that of molecular surface@xcite ( ms , also known as solvent excluded surface , or connolly surface ) .",
    "the ms can be thought as the surface obtained by letting a hard sphere roll at close contact with the atoms of the molecule , to generate a smooth surface made of a connection of pieces of spheres and tori , which represents the part of the van der waals surface exposed to the solvent . during the process of determining the surface ,",
    "interfacial atoms can be identified using a simple geometrical criterion .",
    "many approximated@xcite or analytical@xcite methods have been developed to compute the ms or the sas . in general , these methods are based on discretization or tessellation procedures , requiring therefore the determination of the geometrical structure of the molecule .",
    "other methods which allow to identify molecular surfaces include the approaches of willard and chandler@xcite or the circular variance method of mezei@xcite .",
    "incidentally , the way the ms is computed in the early work of greer and bush@xcite resembles very closely the itim algorithm@xcite .    from the late 1970s ,",
    "the problem of shape identification had started being addressed by a newly born discipline , computational geometry . in this different framework",
    ", several algorithms have been actively pursued to provide a workable definition of surface , and in particular the concept of @xmath0-shapes@xcite showed direct implications for the determination of the molecular surfaces@xcite .",
    "the approach based on @xmath0-shapes is particularly appealing due to its generality and ability to describe , besides the geometry , also the intermolecular topology of the system .",
    "noticeably , none of these methods  to the best of our knowledge  has ever been employed for the determination of intrinsic properties at liquid - liquid or liquid - gas interfaces .",
    "prompted by the apparent similarities between the usage of the circumsphere in the alpha shapes and that of the probe sphere in the itim method , as we will describe in the next section , we investigated in more detail the connection between these two algorithms . as a result",
    ", we developed a generalized version of itim ( gitim ) based on the @xmath0-shapes algorithm .",
    "the new gitim method consistently reproduces the results of itim in the planar case while retaining the ability to describe arbitrarily shaped surfaces . in the following",
    "we describe briefly the alpha shapes and the itim algorithms , explain in detail the generalization of the latter to arbitrarily shaped surfaces , and present several applications .",
    "the concept of @xmath0-shapes was introduced several decades ago by edelsbrunner@xcite . to date the method",
    "is applied in computer graphics application for digital shape sampling and processing , in pattern recognition algorithms and in structural molecular biology@xcite .",
    "the starting point in the determination of the surface of a set of points in the @xmath0-shapes algorithm is the calculation of the delaunay triangulation , one of the most fruitful concepts for computational geometry@xcite , which can be defined in several equivalent ways , for example , as the triangulation that maximizes the smallest angle of all triangles , or the triangulation of the centers of neighboring voronoi cells .",
    "the idea behind the @xmath0-shapes algorithm is to perform a delaunay triangulation of a set of points , and then generate the so - called @xmath0-complex from the union of all k - simplices ( segments , triangles and tetrahedra , for the simplex dimension k=1,2 and 3 , respectively ) , characterized by a k - circumsphere radius ( which is the length of the segment , the radius of the circumcircle and the radius of the circumsphere for k=1,2 and 3 , respectively ) smaller than a given value , @xmath0 ( hence the name ) .",
    "the @xmath0-shape is then defined as the border of the @xmath0-complex , and is a polytope which can be , in general , concave , topologically disconnected , and composed of patches of triangles , strings of edges and even sets of isolated points . in a pictorial way",
    ", one can imagine the @xmath0-shape procedure as growing probe spheres at every point in space until they touch the nearest four atoms .",
    "these spheres will have , in general , different radii .",
    "those atoms that are touched by spheres with radii larger than the predefined value @xmath0 are considered to be at the surface .",
    "o / ccl@xmath8 system .",
    "the oxygen atoms at the interface between the h@xmath9o phase ( inner ) and ccl@xmath8 phase ( outer ) as recognized by the gitim algorithm are represented with an additional halo .",
    "unconnected points belong to molecules which cross periodic boundary conditions.[fig : mixture ] ]    an example of the result of the @xmath0-shapes algorithm in two dimensions is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch]a .",
    "the itim algorithm is based instead on the idea of selecting those atoms of one phase that can be reached by a probe sphere with fixed radius streaming from the other phase along a straight line , perpendicular to the macroscopic surface .",
    "an atom is considered to be reached by the probe sphere if the two can come at a distance equal to the sum of the probe sphere and lennard - jones radii , and no other atom was touched before along the trajectory of the probe sphere . in practice , one selects a finite number of streamlines , and if the space between them is considerably smaller than the typical lennard - jones radius @xmath10 , the result of the algorithm is practically independent of the location and density of the streamlines .",
    "the same is not true regarding the orientation of the streamlines ; this is a direct consequence of the algorithm being designed for planar surfaces only .",
    "the basic idea behind the itim algorithm are sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch]b .",
    "a closer inspection reveals that the condition of being a surface atom for the itim algorithm resembles very much that of the @xmath0-shapes case .",
    "quadruplets of surface atoms identified by the itim algorithm have the characteristic of sharing a common touching sphere having the same radius as the probe sphere . in this way",
    ", one can see the analogy with the @xmath0-shapes algorithm , the @xmath10 parameter being used instead of @xmath0 .",
    "the most important differences in the @xmath0-shapes algorithm with respect to itim are the absence of a volume associated with the atoms , and its independence from any reference frame .",
    "we devised , therefore , a variant of the @xmath0-shapes algorithm that takes into account the excluded volume of the atoms .    in the approach presented here the usual delaunay triangulation",
    "is performed , but the @xmath0-complex is computed substituting the concept of the circumsphere radius with that of the radius of the touching sphere , thus introducing the excluded volume in the calculation of the @xmath0-complex . note that this is different from other approaches that are trying to mimic the presence of excluded volume at a more fundamental level , like the weighted @xmath0-shapes algorithm , which uses the so - called regular triangulation instead of the delaunay one@xcite .",
    "in addition , in order to eliminate all those complexes , such as strings of segments or isolated points , which are rightful elements of the shape , but do not allow a satisfactory definition of a surface , the search for elements of the @xmath0-complex stops in our algorithm at the level of tetrahedra , and triangles and segments are not checked . in this sense gitim can provide substantially different results from the original @xmath0-shapes algorithm .",
    "the equivalent of the @xmath0-complex is then realized by selecting the tetrahedra from the delaunay triangulation whose touching sphere is smaller than a probe sphere of radius @xmath10 , and the equivalent of the @xmath0-shape is just its border , as in the original @xmath0-shapes algorithm .",
    "the procedure to compute the touching sphere radius is described in the appendix .    in the implementation presented here , in order to compute efficiently the delaunay triangulation ,",
    "we have made use of the quickhull algorithm , which takes advantage of the fact that a delaunay triangulation in @xmath11 dimensions can be obtained from the ridges of the lower convex hull in @xmath12 dimensions of the same set of points lifted to a paraboloid in the ancillary dimension@xcite .",
    "the quickhull algorithm employed here@xcite has the particularly advantageous scaling @xmath13 of its computing time with the number @xmath14 and @xmath15 of input points and output vertices , respectively .",
    "a separate issue is represented by the calculation of the intrinsic profiles ( whether profiles of mass density or of any other quantity ) as the distance of an atom in the phase of interest from the surface is not calculated as straightforwardly as in the respective non - intrinsic versions . for each atom in the phase , in fact , three atoms among the interfacial ones have to be identified in order to determine by triangulation@xcite the instantaneous , local position of the interface .",
    "this issue will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : comparison ] for the planar , for the spherical or quasi - spherical and for the general case : here we simply note that we turned down an early implementation of the algorithm that searches for these surface atoms , based on the sorting of the distances using @xmath16 algorithms like quicksort , in favor of a better performing approach , based on kd - trees@xcite , a generalization of the one - dimensional binary tree , which are still built in a @xmath17 time , but allow for range search in ( typically ) @xmath18 time .",
    "we have compared the results of the itim and gitim algorithms applied to the water / carbon tetrachloride interface composed of 6626 water and 966 ccl@xmath8 molecules .",
    "the water and ccl@xmath8 molecules have been described by the tip4p model@xcite , and by the potential of mcdonald and coworkers@xcite , respectively .",
    "the molecules have been kept rigid using the shake algorithm@xcite .",
    "this simulation , as well as the others reported in this work have been performed using the gromacs@xcite simulation package employing an integration time step of 1 fs , periodic boundary conditions , a cutoff at 0.8 nm for lennard - jones interactions and the smooth particle mesh ewald algorithm@xcite for computing the electrostatic interaction , with a mesh spacing of 0.12 nm ( also with a cut - off at 0.8 nm for the real - space part of the interaction ) .",

    "we have used the itim and gitim algorithms to identify the interfacial atoms of the water phase in the system , for different sizes of the probe sphere . in general",
    ", gitim identifies systematically a larger number of interfacial atoms than itim for the same value of the probe sphere radius @xmath10 , as it is clearly seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : nvsa ] . remarkably , for values of the probe sphere radius smaller than about 0.2 nm ( compare , for example , with the optimal itim parameter @xmath19 nm suggested in ref .  ) , the interfacial atoms identified by gitim show the onset of percolation .",
    "the reason for this behavior traces back to the fact that itim is unable to identify voids buried in the middle of the phase , as it is effectively probing only the cross section of the voids along the direction of the streamlines .",
    "this difference could explain the higher number of surface atoms identified by gitim , as voids in a region with high local curvature ( or , in other words , with a local surface normal which deviates significantly from the macroscopic one ) will not be identified as such by itim . in gitim , on the contrary , probe spheres can be thought as inflating at every point in space instead of moving down the streamlines , and this is the reason why the algorithm is able to identify also small pockets inside the opposite phase .",
    "it is possible to make a rough but enlightening analytical estimate of the probability for a probe sphere of null radius in the itim algorithm to penetrate for a distance @xmath20 in a fluid of hard spheres with diameter @xmath21 and number density @xmath22 .",
    "using the very crude approximation of randomly distributed spheres , the probability @xmath23 to pass the first molecular layer , at a depth @xmath24 is the effective cross section @xmath25 , and that of reaching a generic depth @xmath20 can be approximated as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 defines a penetration depth .",
    "therefore , using a probe sphere with a null radius , itim will identify a ( diffuse ) surface at a depth @xmath28 , while gitim will identify every atom as a surface one . for water at ambient conditions , the penetration is @xmath29 nm , a distance smaller than the size of a water molecule itself .",
    "this could explain why in ref .",
    ", even using a probe sphere radius as small as 0.05 nm , almost only water molecules in the first layer were identified as interfacial ones by itim ( see the almost perfectly gaussian distribution of interfacial water molecules in fig.9 of ref .  ) .",
    "o / ccl@xmath8 system in one simulation snapshot as recognized by gitim exclusively ( small spheres ) , itim exclusively ( large spheres ) or by both methods ( sphere with halo).[fig : recognition ] ]    nevertheless , it is important for practical reasons to be able to match the outcome of both algorithms .",
    "it turns out that choosing @xmath10 so that the average number of interfacial atoms identified by both algorithms is roughly the same leads also , not surprisingly , to very similar distributions . the probe sphere radius required for gitim to obtain a similar average number of surface atom as in itim",
    "can be obtained by an interpolation of the values reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : nvsa ] .",
    "an example showing explicitly the interfacial atoms identified by the two methods ( @xmath30 nm for itim and @xmath31 nm for gitim ) is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : recognition ] : roughly 85% of surface atoms are identified simultaneously by both methods , demonstrating the good agreement between the two methods once the probe sphere radius has been re - gauged .",
    "the condition of identifying the same atoms as interfacial ones is much more strict that any condition on average quantities , like the spatial distribution of interfacial atoms or intrinsic density profiles .",
    "hence , it is expected that a good agreement on such quantities can also be achieved .",
    ".[fig : density ] ]    the intrinsic density profiles of water and carbon tetrachloride are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : density ] , as computed by itim and gitim , respectively , with the interfacial water molecules as reference .",
    "the procedure for identifying the local distance of an atom from the surface is in its essence the same as described in ref .  .",
    "starting from the projection @xmath32 of the position of the given atom to the macroscopic interface plane , the two interfacial atoms closest to @xmath33 are found ( their position on the interface plane being @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively ) .",
    "the third closest atom with projection @xmath36 has then to be found , with the condition that the triangle @xmath37 contains the point @xmath33 .",
    "a linear interpolation of the elevation of @xmath33 from those of the other points is eventually performed , and employed to compute the distance @xmath38 which is used to compute the intrinsic density profile .    efficient neighbor search for the @xmath34 , @xmath35 and candidate @xmath36 atoms is implemented using kd - trees@xcite as discussed before .",
    "the two pairs of profiles are very similar , besides a small difference in the position and height of the main peak of the ccl@xmath8 profile ( curves on the right in fig .",
    "[ fig : density ] ) and in the minimum of the water profile ( curves on the left in fig .",
    "[ fig : density ] ) right next to the surface position , which are anyway compatible with the differences observed between various methods for the calculation of intrinsic density profiles@xcite .",

    "[ fig : density ] , and defines the origin of the reference system .",
    "negative values of the signed distance from the interface correspond to the aqueous phase .",
    "before applying gitim to non - planar interfaces , one important issue has still to be solved , namely that of the proper calculation of intrinsic density profiles in non - planar geometries . in general , one uses one - dimensional density profiles ( intrinsic or non - intrinsic ) when the system is , or is assumed to be , invariant under displacements along the interface , so that the orthogonal degrees of freedom can be integrated out .",
    "when the interface has a non - planar shape , one needs to use a different coordinate system . in the case of a quasi - spherical object for example",
    ", one could use the spherical coordinate system to compute the non - intrinsic density profile , and normalize each bin by the integral of the jacobian determinant , that is the volume of the shell at constant distance from the origin . in the intrinsic case , however , it is necessary to know at every time step the volume of the shells at constant distance from the interface .",
    "the volume of shells at constant intrinsic distance can , in principle , be calculated at each frame by regular numerical integration , but this would require a large computing time and storage overhead . here , instead , we propose to employ an approach based on simple monte carlo integration : in parallel with the calculation of the histograms for the various phases , we compute also that of a random distribution of points , equal in number to the total atoms in the simulation . the volume of a shell can be estimated as box volume times the ratio of the number of points found at a given distance and the total number of random points drawn .",
    "we are following the heuristic idea that for each frame @xmath39 one does not need to know the volume of the shell @xmath40 with a precision higher than that of the average number of atoms in it , @xmath41 .",
    "in addition , we assume that the surface area of the interface is large enough for the shell volume variations @xmath42 to be small with respect to its average value @xmath43 . the average density @xmath44 can be approximated as @xmath45.\\ ] ] when the relative volume changes @xmath46 are small , one can therefore simply normalize the histogram @xmath47 by the average volume @xmath48 obtained by the monte carlo procedure , disregarding the terms of order @xmath49 .",
    "the correctness of our assumption is demonstrated incidentally by the application of this normalization once again to the planar case .",
    "the thin lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : density ] represent the itim intrinsic mass density profile of water and carbon tetrachloride , using the monte carlo normalization scheme instead of the usual normalization with box cross sectional area and slab width .",
    "close to the interface , the monte carlo normalization gives results which are fully compatible with the usual method , showing that the accuracy of the volume estimate is adequate . on",
    "the other hand one can see that far from the interface the two profiles behave quite differently .",
    "the case with usual normalization decays slowly to zero : this effect is due to the presence of the second interface , whose profile is smeared again by capillary waves . the case with monte carlo normalization , on the contrary , shows that it is possible to recover the proper intrinsic density also at larger distances , and features such as the fourth peak at 2 nm , which are completely hidden in the normal picture , can be revealed .",
    "this shows that the use of the proper , curvilinear coordinate system is of fundamental importance also for macroscopically planar interfaces .",
    "the calculation of the monte carlo normalization factors does not change the typical scaling of the algorithm , as it consists in calculating the histogram for an additional phase of randomly distributed points ( which effectively behaves as an ideal gas ) . the better accuracy at larger distances ,",

    "the conditions of touching can be expressed with the following nonlinear system of four equations :      by subtracting one of them from the other three ( without loss of generality we subtract the one with @xmath71 ) , the quadratic term , @xmath72 , will be eliminated and the system eq.([eq : constr ] ) would become linear with respect to @xmath73 : @xmath74 where the matrix @xmath75 and the vectors @xmath76 and @xmath77 are defined as @xmath78 and @xmath79   \\mathbf{r}_1 ^ 2-\\mathbf{r}_3 ^ 2-r_1 ^ 2+r_3 ^ 2 \\\\[0.2em ] \\mathbf{r}_1",

    "once eq.([eq : r ] ) is substituted into the first of the constraints eq.([eq : constr ] ) , it leads to the quadratic algebraic equation with respect to @xmath65 : @xmath83 where @xmath84 .",

    "<S> we present a generalized version of the itim algorithm for the identification of interfacial molecules , which is able to treat arbitrarily shaped interfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the algorithm exploits the similarities between the concept of probe sphere used in itim and the circumsphere criterion used in the @xmath0-shapes approach , and can be regarded either as a reference - frame independent version of the former , or as an extended version of the latter that includes the atomic excluded volume . </S>",
    "<S> the new algorithm is applied to compute the intrinsic orientational order parameters of water around a dpc and a cholic acid micelle in aqueous environment , and to the identification of solvent - reachable sites in four model structures for soot . </S>",
    "<S> the additional algorithm introduced for the calculation of intrinsic density profiles in arbitrary geometries proved to be extremely useful also for planar interfaces , as it allows to solve the paradox of smeared intrinsic profiles far from the interface . </S>"
