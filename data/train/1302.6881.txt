    "the importance of b(e2)@xmath0 values compilation and evaluation was recognized in the 1960s by stelson and grodzins @xcite .",
    "evaluated quadrupole collectivity ( reduced electric quadrupole transition rates ) values are essential for nuclear structure physics and in high demand for nuclear model calculations .",
    "these nuclear data activities flourished at oak ridge national laboratory at the end of the century under the leadership of raman , who produced two excellent evaluations @xcite . in recent years , this project was transferred to brookhaven national laboratory in order to ensure continuation of this important work .",
    "the volume of b(e2)@xmath0 data is rapidly increasing due to the general availability of supercomputers and nuclear radioactive beam facilities .",
    "these facilities have been producing rare nuclei far from the valley of stability at an increasing rate , providing researchers with unprecedented opportunities to study their properties . in many cases , b(e2 ) values and energies of the low - lying states",
    "have been studied for the first time .",
    "large amounts of new data , especially for the a@xmath3100 region , require a new evaluation of quadrupole collectivities for proper interpretation and analysis of the newly - obtained values .",
    "access to these data is of paramount importance for the scidac ad frib collaborations @xcite . to satisfy the evolving needs of theoretical and experimental nuclear physics ,",
    "a new b(e2)@xmath0 evaluation has been launched @xcite .",
    "this work broadens the previous evaluation of even - even nuclei @xcite along the nuclear landscape , and includes many new experimental and evaluated quantities .",
    "it consists of an updated set of compiled experimental parameters , comprehensive data analysis and evaluation and large - scale shell model calculations .",
    "it extends the list of evaluated nuclei from 53 to 68 and from 20 to 38 in the z=2 - 22 and z=24 - 30 regions , respectively .",
    "more details are given in the following sections .",

    "the b(e2)@xmath0 evaluation is proceeding under the auspices of the u.s .",
    "nuclear data program .",
    "this effort is continuation of the previous works of stelson , grodzins and raman @xcite .",
    "this procedure includes the broadened nuclear structure data sets supported by shell model calculations for all known even - even nuclei .",
    "the subset of the latest quadrupole collectivity data relevant to double - beta decay problem has been noted @xcite .",
    "these well - established data could provide some guidance for theoretical calculations of double - beta decay rates for nuclei of interest where information on gamow - teller transitions is lacking .",
    "the data evaluation for the z@xmath428 nuclei @xcite is publicly available and the whole z=2 - 56 region is completed .",
    "the evaluation of the z@xmath556 region is currently underway and will become available in the next few years .    _ acknowledgments _ : we are indebted to m. herman ( bnl ) for his support of this project , and grateful to m. blennau ( bnl ) for help with the manuscript .",
