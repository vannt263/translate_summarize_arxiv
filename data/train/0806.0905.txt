    "conservative spectrum policies employed by regulatory authorities have resulted in spectrum underutilization of the overall available spectrum for wireless communications .",
    "measurements performed by agencies such as the federal communications commission @xcite in the united states and ofcom @xcite in the united kingdom have revealed that at any given time , large portions of spectrum are sparsely occupied .",
    "findings of such campaigns on spectrum usage have challenged the traditional spectrum management approaches .",
    "the concept of cognitive radio ( cr ) @xcite refers to a smart radio which can sense the external electromagnetic environment and adapt its transmission parameters according to the current state of the environment .",
    "crs can access parts of the spectrum for their information transmission , provided that they cause minimal interference to the primary users in that band  @xcite .",
    "therefore , spectrum sharing among the primary licensee and the secondary cr must be carried out in a controlled fashion . in the technical literature ,",
    "the _ interference temperature _ introduced by kolodzy @xcite indicates the interference level at the primary licensee s receiver . from the licensees point of view",
    ", the secondary access can be controlled in two ways .",
    "the total interference power can be required to remain below a certain threshold ( an interference temperature constraint ) or the signal - to - noise - and - interference ( sinr ) can be constrained .",
    "the capacity of wireless systems has been extensively studied under fixed spectrum access . for cr , this work is less mature and many information / communication theoretic problems and implementation issues @xcite remain to be solved . however , several interesting results on the capacity , outage probability and throughput of cr systems have recently emerged .",
    "see for example ,  @xcite . in @xcite , gastpar derived the capacity of different non - fading additive - white - gaussian - noise ( awgn ) channels with the average received - power at a primary receiver being constrained . in @xcite ,",
    "ghasemi and sousa showed that with the same limit on the received - power level , channel capacity for a range of fading models ( e.g. , rayleigh , nakagami-@xmath0 and log - normal fading ) exceeds that of the non - fading awgn channel . in some scenarios ,",
    "primary user spectral activity in the vicinity of the cognitive transmitter may differ from that in the vicinity of the cognitive receiver . considering this , in @xcite ,",
    "the capacity of opportunistic spectrum acquisition in the presence of distributed spectral activity has been investigated .",
    "we extend the work in @xcite which assumed that fading conditions for the interference path ( cr transmitter - primary receiver ) and the desired path ( cr transmitter - cr receiver ) are the same . in practice , these two links could experience different fading conditions ( types ) and different link powers ( due to path length or shadowing ) .",
    "this is referred as _ asymmetric _",
    "fading in this paper .    in this paper",
    "we consider rayleigh and rician fading .",
    "hence , we are able to quantify the effects of propagation paths consisting of both line - of - sight ( los ) and scattered components . building on the work in @xcite",
    ", this paper makes the following main contributions :    1 .",
    "the secondary capacity under average - received power and peak - power constraints is studied for asymmetric conditions including different fading types ( rayleigh and rician ) and different link powers . here",
    "we show that under low interference to the primary receiver , the secondary capacity is sensitive to the fading type on the desired and interference paths",
    "the impact of multiple primary licensee receivers in rayleigh and rician fading is studied for peak power constraints .",
    "closed - form expressions for the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) and the probability density function ( pdf ) of a random variable ( rv ) , @xmath1 is derived , for the cases where @xmath2 experience ( rayleigh , rician ) and ( rician , rayleigh ) fading .",
    "this is needed to derive the above mentioned capacities .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the system and channel model is described in section  ii . in section",
    "iii we derive the exact pdfs for the ratio of rayleigh and rician rvs . in section",
    "iv , these results are used to study the capacity gains under average / peak received - power constraints respectively .",
    "extensions of these results to multiple primary users are presented in section  v. finally , some conclusions are drawn in section  vi . throughout the paper",
    ", the reference to average / peak received - power refers to as the average / peak interference power at the primary receiver .",
    "the cr link is also referred to as a secondary link .",
    "in this section , the system and channel model considered in the paper are briefly outlined ( cf .",
    "the system model is borrowed from @xcite , however we have considered asymmetric fading scenarios .",
    "a point - to - point flat fading channel with perfect channel side information available to both the receiver and the transmitter is assumed .",
    "let @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the instantaneous channel gains from the secondary transmitter to the primary and secondary receivers respectively .",
    "furthermore , we denote the respective pdfs by @xmath5 and @xmath6 . for a unit power channel gain ,",
    "the rayleigh pdf is given by @xmath7 for @xmath8 .",
    "for a rician distribution the pdf is given by @xmath9 for @xmath8 , where @xmath10 is the rician @xmath10-factor defined as the ratio of signal power in dominant component over the scattered power and @xmath11 is the zeroth - order modified bessel function of the first kind . for @xmath12 , rayleigh fading is experienced and @xmath13 gives the awgn ( no fading ) situation .",
    "values of the @xmath10-factor in indoor / outdoor land mobile applications normally range from @xmath14 db @xcite . in a practical environment",
    "the cr transmitter to cr receiver link may not be of the same length as the cr interference path to the primary receiver .",
    "when the link powers , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , differ , it can be shown that capacity only depends on the power ratio .",
    "hence , we define the relative power parameter , @xmath17 , by @xmath18 . note that @xmath19 denotes the expectation operator",
    "two important items of notation should be stressed at this point .",
    "since the main results of the paper depend on the ratio @xmath1 , we use the shorthand notation rayleigh / rician to indicate that @xmath20 is rayleigh and @xmath21 is rician .",
    "similarly , rician / rayleigh indicates that @xmath20 is rician and @xmath21 is rayleigh .",
    "the second issue is that the secondary transmitter must constrain its power so that the interference at the primary is acceptable .",
    "hence the power constraints in this scenario are really interference constraints .",
    "this is different to many other problems where the constraints are for transmit power .",
    "here , we anticipate the results of section  iv , where it is shown that capacity depends on the ratio , @xmath1 . hence , in this section the cdf and the pdf for a rayleigh / rician rv and a rician / rayleigh rv are derived .",

    "the pdfs of and were validated by monte carlo simulations , and a perfect match was obtained .",
    "in this section , we investigate the capacity gains achievable by the secondary user under an average received - power constraint . in @xcite , the channel capacity was expressed as @xmath48 such that @xmath49 where @xmath36 is the maximum average interference power tolerated by the primary receiver  , @xmath50 is the available bandwidth , @xmath51 is the noise power at the secondary receiver and @xmath52 denotes the optimal power allocation . using the lagrangian technique ,",
    "@xcite has found @xmath52 to be @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes @xmath55 .",
    "note that @xmath56 is determined such that the average receive power is equal to @xmath36 .",

    "therefore , @xmath64 is the allowable interference - to - noise power ratio at the primary receiver . using integration by parts , can be further simplified as @xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes the cdf of @xmath63 .",
    "hence , using we have calculated @xmath67 numerically .",
    "note that the calculations in - are general and apply to both the equal power ( @xmath68 ) and the unequal power ( @xmath69 ) case . in section  iii the required pdfs and cdfs",
    "were derived for the equal power case .",
    "when @xmath69 , it is a simple process to repeat the steps in - and to show that using @xmath70 instead of @xmath64 in with the equal power results from section  iii gives the correct results .",
    "hence , we only require the pdf and cdf of @xmath71 for the equal power case . to obtain results for the unequal power case ,",
    "we simply use @xmath70 rather than @xmath64 in .",
    "this is equivalent to replacing @xmath51 by @xmath72 , which makes intuitive sense since a power ratio of @xmath17 implies that the secondary receiver receives a signal @xmath17 times stronger than the primary .",
    "hence , relative to the equal power case the snr is @xmath17 times bigger and the equivalent noise level is @xmath72 .    figs .",
    "[ fig_2 ] and [ fig_3 ] show the secondary capacity versus @xmath64 and under an average received interference power constraint . in all plots",

    "@xmath73 db . ]    1 .",
    "the secondary capacity increases if the primary receiver can tolerate more interference .",
    "this is because the secondary transmitter is able to transmit with higher power ( probabilistically ) .",
    "the case of interest in engineering practice is for a low value of @xmath64 , i.e. , when the acceptable cr interference is correspondingly low .",
    "here we see that the capacity can be sensitive to the type of fading and indeed the symmetric fading , i.e , the rayleigh / rayleigh case significantly overestimates the capacity compared to the rayleigh / rician case in the low @xmath64 regime .",
    "this observation is central to our contribution in this paper .",
    "the difference in capacity reduces to almost zero when the acceptable interference at the primary is large .",
    "3 .   the capacity of rician / rayleigh fading ( cf .",
    "[ fig_3 ] ) is not so sensitive to the @xmath10-factor @xmath74 db . for a given @xmath64 ,",
    "the rayleigh fading on the primary link determines the transmit power of the secondary user .",
    "once this is determined , the resulting secondary user capacity is less sensitive to the @xmath10-factor within the considered range of @xmath75 db .",
    "this is in contrast with rayleigh / rician fading , ( cf .",
    "[ fig_4 ] ) , where we see that the @xmath10-factor induces an appreciable capacity difference especially in the low @xmath64 regime .",
    "as @xmath10-factor decreases and in the low @xmath64 regime , more opportunities for the secondary user to transmit with relatively high power are created . however , for large @xmath64 , the impact of changing @xmath10-factor on the secondary user transmit power is reduced .",
    "4 .   under fading ,",
    "the secondary capacity is higher than the awgn case .",
    "this observation is consistent with the findings of @xcite . in a fading environment",
    ", the secondary user can transmit with high power , when its signal received by the primary user is subject to deep fades .      as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "although _ average _ received - power is reasonable for delay insensitive applications , in other cases it is desirable to impose a peak received - power constraint . under the peak received - power constraint @xcite @xmath76 and the channel capacity",
    "was given in @xcite as @xmath77 therefore , under rayleigh / rician fading the channel capacity is obtained by substituting the pdf in into .",

    "@xmath80    similarly , under rician / rayleigh fading the channel capacity is given by on the next page .",
    "the case where the shadowing on the two links is different can be derived using the same arguments as above .",

    "such differences usually arise from shadowing and path length differences .",
    "we assume two values for the power ratio between the links , @xmath81 db and @xmath82 db . the effect on cr capacity is a simple scaling by the @xmath17 parameter .",
    "hence , we have a simple and efficient approach to investigating such asymmetric links .    @xmath83",
    "when @xmath84 primary users are present , the transmit / receive powers of the secondary user would be subject to additional constraints .",
    "this leads to a capacity reduction @xcite .",
    "let @xmath85 denote the channel gain of the secondary transmitter to the @xmath86-th primary receiver . in this case",
