    "gas outflows a potential source of feedback that regulates the evolution of the central black hole , the host galaxy , and the intergalactic medium ( e.g. elvis 2006 ) . in the rest - frame uv spectra of 10",
    " 20% of all quasars @xcite , outflows are manifested in blueshifted broad absorption lines ( bal ) .",
    "the most common of these are associated with resonance lines of medium ionization species , such as , , , , and and can reach velocities as high as 50,000 km @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , their saturated nature limits their utility in determining the physical characteristics of the outflow .",
    "a subset of bal quasars , known as lobals , also show complexes of narrower ( on the order of @xmath3  km  s@xmath4 ) absorption features from low ionization species such as , , and . among these",
    ", objects that include troughs of metastable or are specifically called felobals .",
    "these are useful because the column densities of metastable levels offer valuable diagnostics of the outflow ( gabel et al .",
    "2006 ; arav et al . 2005 ; and references therein ) .",
    "these studies place the gas responsible for the felobal at distances between @xmath0 1  kpc @xcite and up to @xmath010 kpc @xcite .",
    "we studied the various kinematic components in the felobal troughs of two quasars , qso 23591241 and sdss j03180600 , @xmath50.868 and 1.967 respectively @xcite .",
    "it was found that among the various kinematic components the highest column density component of each system also had the highest particle density , while all other components have densities of about one quarter of that of the main component .",
    "moreover , all the components seem to be located at the same distance from the central source , suggesting that they are all related to each other .",
    "this is also consistent with the finding of @xcite that bals and lobals could be explained simultaneously by ablation of either a single large cloud or many scattered clouds .",
    "another characteristic of felobals is that , within the sample of known objects , they are borderline density - bounded .",
    "felobal quasars are seen in absorption from species that arise from the ionization front ( if ) of the cloud ( e.g. and ) while atoms from a neutral cold region , e.g. or , are not seen .",
    "this seems to point out some relationship between the ionization front and the nature of the clouds .",
    "the location of the if of a cloud of a given density depends on the flux of hydrogen ionizing photons , particularly in the @xmath01 to 4 ryd energy range , from the radiation source .",
    "however , quasar continua are known to vary in the optical and uv within time scales of the order of one year @xcite .",
    "hence , it is important to understand the effect of the varying radiation field on the structure of the felobal .    in this letter",
    "we show that when the flux that ionizes a felobal cloud drops the depth of the ionized region often shrinks at supersonic speeds followed by a cooling front , as explained in sections 2 and 3 . in section 4 we show that the supersonic cooling front creates a rarefaction wave , traveling in the opposite direction to the front , which results in fragmentation of the cloud . under some conditions",
    ", such a fragmentation can explain the observed structure of felobals .",
    "let us start with the simple picture illustrated in fig .",
    "[ sketch ] . here , @xmath6 is the depth of the neutral region of the cloud and it is measured from the far end of the cloud towards the central source . for a given luminosity of the source and a cloud of constant particle density",
    "@xmath7 moving in a medium of negligible density one can draw an imaginary radius within which the cloud is fully ionized .",
    "this is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is rate of hydrogen ionizing photons from the central source , @xmath10 is the recombination rate coefficient , and @xmath11 is the depth of the cloud . for a cloud located beyond @xmath12 the ionized depth ( @xmath13 )",
    "is related to the physical distance ( @xmath14 ) as @xmath15 .",
    "thus , felobal outflows that result from the formation of an if , but without an extended neutral region , must be located right at @xmath12 . then , a drop @xmath16 in the ionization flux , i.e. @xmath17 , will create a region of depth @xmath18 of either neutral or recombining plasma . here , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is total column density of the cloud and has a typical value of @xmath21  @xmath22 . in deriving this equation we assumed that @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in qso 23591241 and sdss j03180600 @xmath7",
    "are @xmath25  @xmath26 and @xmath27  @xmath26 and the sizes of the absorbers are @xmath28@xmath29  cm ( i.e. @xmath00.01 to 0.1 light - years ) .",
    "the change in the ionization of the gas is not instantaneous , but delayed by the recombination time scale of the plasma @xmath30 , with @xmath31@xmath32  s@xmath4@xmath26 at @xmath33  k. then , @xmath34  yrs in qso 23591241 and 100  yrs in sdss j03180600 . for example",
    ", in the case that @xmath9 is abruptly shut off , the size of the ionized region is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the time measured from the moment that the flux is turned off .",
    "thus , the depth of the ionized region shrinks with a speed @xmath37 thus , from the derivation of @xmath11 and @xmath38 above @xmath39  km  s@xmath4 , which is much faster than the speed of sound in the plasma .",
    "the width of quasi - static ifs is of the order of the mean free path for ionizing radiation , i.e. @xmath40 , where @xmath41  @xmath42 is the photoionization cross section .",
    "thus , the if s in qso   23591241 and sdss  j03180600 are on the order of @xmath43@xmath44  cm , which are much smaller than the distance on which the if retrats for flux variations on @xmath45  year time scale . still , these continuum variations much shorter than the recombination time will broaden the if creating an extended recombining region .",
    "but , as the if departs from ionization equilibrium it also departs from thermal equilibrium . in a static if the temperature drops to a much lower value for a given value of the optical depth to heating photons .",
    "the optical depth is @xmath46 with @xmath47 the neutral hydrogen density .",
    "let us assume , for instance , a static if of the form @xmath48 . as the ionized region shrinks the characteristic depth of the front increases to @xmath49 .",
    "at an early time @xmath36 after an instantaneous retreat of the if @xmath50 .",
    "thus , for an if brodening by a factor @xmath51 it will take a time @xmath52 for the cooling front to start moving with the retreating if . then",
    ", if the value of @xmath53 for which the temperature drops remains constant the depth within the if at which this happens , @xmath54 , will be reduced with respect to @xmath55 .",
    "for example , if the change in temperature occurred at @xmath56 in the static if , @xmath57 for @xmath58 , @xmath59 for @xmath60 , and @xmath61 for @xmath62 . in the region of new lower equilibrium temperature cooling of the plasma",
    "proceeds much faster than recombination , because the cooling time scale is only @xmath63  years @xcite . in conclusion ,",
    "the drop in temperature closely follows the supersonic shrinking of the ionized region despite the broadening if .",
    "note that a drop in temperature makes recombination speed up , because @xmath31 increases as @xmath64 as the electron temperature @xmath65 decreases .",
    "what happens when the flux increases again ?",
    "as the ionizing flux rises the neutral fragment of the cloud will be re - ionized .",
    "thus , an if will travel through the neutral fragment , in the direction away from the ionizing source .",
    "this process is governed by the equation @xmath66 the speed of the if in this case is proportional by the change in radiative flux and can be highly supersonic , in which case it will send shocks ahead of the if and rarefaction waves in the opposite direction .    in conclusion ,",
    "time variations of the ionizing flux are expected to have two kinds of effects : ( 1 ) in the region neighboring the if the ionization varies with time and departure from photoionization equilibrium could occur .",
    "this effect is out of the scope of this paper , but will be the subject of future investigation .",
    "( 2 ) the varying ionizing flux will create supersonic cooling and heating fronts traveling through the ionized fraction of the cloud and the neutral region .",
    "these will be accompanied by rarefaction waves and shocks .",
    "this process is investigated in section 4 of this letter , but first we will derive a more accurate description of the dynamics of the if .",
    "the if within a cloud is defined as the region where the ionization drops to near zero .",
    "thus , we solve for @xmath67 in the time dependent photoionization equation @xmath68[continuity ] where @xmath36 is time , @xmath69 is the velocity of the gas , and @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the ionization and recombination rates per volume , @xmath72 @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the optical depth within the cloud up to the depth @xmath75 .    integrating eqn .",
    "[ continuity ] in the co - moving frame of the if ( @xmath76 ) over the ionized volume @xmath77 , with @xmath78 the covering solid angle , one finds a differential equation for @xmath79 @xmath80[ifeqn ] for gas clouds much smaller than the distance to the ionizing source , i.e. @xmath81 , one can assume constant density during a crossing time of the cloud ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "then , @xmath83.\\]][ifsolution ]    to understand this solution it is useful to check a couple of cases :    _ 1 ) @xmath84 varying as a step function .",
    "_ let us assume that at @xmath85 the absorber just reached @xmath12 when the continuum flux was @xmath86 .",
    "thus , the cloud is fully ionized and a drop in @xmath87 will produce an if .",
    "if the absorber were closer than @xmath12 it could remain fully ionized even when @xmath87 is reduced .",
    "if the flux drops to @xmath88 at @xmath85 for @xmath89 one gets @xmath90\\ ] ] and @xmath91 which is consistent with the result of equation ( 4 ) and yields supersonic @xmath92 for flux variations of @xmath93 or greater , i.e. @xmath94 .    _ 2 ) @xmath95 from observed quasar continua_. here we compute the ionization of the cloud vs. time for selected quasar continua observed by @xcite using eqn.(10 ) .",
    "[ ifobs ] shows the observer flux , the if location with respect to the total depth of the cloud @xmath11 and @xmath92 for three quasars .",
    "these objects are chosen out of a sample of 17 quasars observed by kaspi et al . because these illustrate the types of dynamical behaviors of the if .",
    "because the calculations are done for illustrative purposes only we disregard the uncertainties on the measured fluxes .",
    "notice , for example , that in pg0844 the @xmath96 ratio is generally decreasing with time because the average ionizing continuum is lower than at the initial time of observation .",
    "this overall behavior is somewhat arbitrary as it depends on the initial observation .",
    "what is more meaningful , though , is the instantaneous velocity of the if front , computed as @xmath97 , and this is seen to reach highly supersonic values .",
    "this is because the flux levels in pg0844 , pg1226 , and pg1411 vary by @xmath040% , @xmath050% , and @xmath030% with respect to the value at @xmath85 in less than a year . clearly , this determination of velocities is sensitive to the observational errors as well as the sampling of the quasar luminosity .",
    "hence , we make no definitive claims on specific objects .",
    "however , the prediction that highly supersonic fronts are expected is supported in every object of the available sample .",
    "the supersonic if is accompanied by a cooling front that leaves a pressure step behind .",
    "this creates a rearward - facing , i.e. in the opposite direction to the if , rarefaction wave and a forward - facing shock @xcite . under homogeneous conditions and for an infinite flow stream these waves and shocks will form periodically @xcite . as discussed before ,",
    "the fragments once created become re - ionized and re - heated when the flux recovers",
    ". then one can study the jump conditions between the main cloud and the fragments assuming constant temperature .",
    "in one dimension the jump conditions across the rarefaction wave are @xmath98[maseqn ] @xmath99[preseqn ] @xmath100[mageqn ] where @xmath101 is the mass density of the gas , @xmath102 is the bulk velocity of the gas in the co - moving frame of the wave ( @xmath103 ) , @xmath104 is the thermal pressure , and @xmath105 is the strength of the magnetic field . because the jump is essentially isothermal we adopt @xmath106 , and from eqns . ( 13 ) - ( 15 ) one gets @xmath107,\\ ] ] where @xmath108 is the alfven velocity .",
    "thus , the difference of velocities between the fragments and the main cloud is @xmath109^{1/2},\\]][fragvelocity ] where we have used typical conditions @xmath110 and @xmath111  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "this result shows that rarefaction waves , originated by supersonic if , yield lower density fragments that detach from the main cloud with relative velocities of tens of km  s@xmath4 in absence of magnetic fields and much larger velocities when these are present .    there is evidence suggesting the presence of magnetic fields in bals .",
    "large trough widths , of the order of 100  km / s , are observed in felobals , with the largest widths being generally associated with the main absorber ( see table 1 of bautista et al .",
    "the widths are much greater than expected from thermal broadening and seem to indicate supersonic turbulent velocities which could only be sustained by equally fast alfven waves . the alternative scenario that observed trough widths could be mostly due to bulk velocity gradients along the line of sight is inconsistent with the fact that clouds have been able to travel @xmath112  kpc away from the agn without diffusing into the interstellar medium .",
    "moreover , it is difficult to understand how bulk velocity gradients could yield similar trough profiles for ions with different ionization stages ( but see arav et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "strong magnetic fields in bal clouds have been proposed in the past .",
    "@xcite pointed out that magnetic pressures in bal clouds must exceed thermal and radiative pressures to confine the clouds when accelerated up to thousands of km  s@xmath4 .",
    "their models for acceleration of bal clouds yield magnetic field strengths of the order of 10  mg .",
    "further , @xcite argue that bal quasar outflows could carry a large fraction of the magnetic energy of the intergalactic medium in clusters of galaxies",
    ". the source of such magnetic fields could be either from the accretion disc of the agn @xcite , or from dynamo - like effects in the plasmas such as in the solar winds and supernova remnants @xcite .",
    "we find that magnetic fields of the order of 10  mg , i.e. alfven velocities of a few hundred km  s@xmath4 , would explain the observed velocity separations between the main and the minor components as observed in qso  23591241 and sdss  j03180600 ( see bautista et al .",
    "2010 ) .    another interesting aspect of eqn .",
    "( 17 ) is that it predicts fragments that are faster than the main cloud as well as fragments that are slower than the main cloud , as seen in felobals .",
    "for example , since @xmath113 if @xmath114  km  s@xmath4 and @xmath115  km  s@xmath4 , then @xmath116  km  s@xmath4 and @xmath117  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "by contrast , if @xmath118  km  s@xmath4 then @xmath119  km  s@xmath4 and @xmath120  km  s@xmath4 . the faster clouds , in the rest frame of the quasar ,",
    "are expected to outrun the main cloud and remain undisturbed by it .",
    "the survival of the slower clouds depends on the geometry of the problem .",
    "in one dimensional geometry the slow clouds would be swept up by the main cloud . in two and three dimensions it is possible that magnetic fields produce surface tension in the clouds capable of withstanding the fluid bulk pressure .",
    "the deceleration of the flow along the axis of travel of the main cloud and its fragments yields a bow shock , where the supersonic gas of the main cloud flows smoothly around the small fragment ( see shu 1992 ) .",
    "we studied the effects of quasar time variable uv flux on felobal clouds . in these systems absorption from and comes from a region just before an if .",
    "this if is formed within the absorbing cloud when the cloud crosses a distance @xmath12 from the radiation source . at this distance ,",
    "when the radiation flux drops the ionized region of the cloud will retreat at supersonic speeds .",
    "a cooling front will follow the ionized region and the if will also retreat and broaden .",
    "this creates a pressure imbalance across the if on time scales much shorter than the sound crossing time .",
    "thus , the cooling front yields a rarefaction wave that travels into the low temperature region . to conserve momentum across the cloud",
    "the large pressure imbalance is compensated by an increased speed of the cold gas relative to the front .",
    "now , when the flux recovers the neutral rarefied region is re - ionized and re - heated by an if moving away from the ionizing source .",
    "this if can be highly supersonic , driving a shock ahead of it and a rarefaction wave in the opposite direction .",
    "the shocked gas forms new clouds and stabilize at a temperature of @xmath1  k , like the main cloud .",
    "these clouds are detached in velocity space from the main cloud and there are rarefaction waves moving between the clouds .",
    "there are two fundamental parameters in determining the speed of the retreating if .",
    "one is the ratio of the depth of the cloud to the recombination rate , @xmath121 , which in turn is proportional to the column density of the cloud , @xmath20 .",
    "thus , high column density clouds can have faster ifs .",
    "the other parameter is the ratio of the variability time scale of the ionizing source to the recombination time .",
    "flux variations on scales of @xmath45  year are enough for significant effects in felobals with particle densities of @xmath1  @xmath26 , while variability on shorter time scales would affect higher density clouds . when the flux drops , broadening of the if slows the cooling front down such that marginally supersonic if may not lead to shocks and waves , but faster ifs will .",
    "the thermal pressure imbalance across the ifs alone yields velocities to the fragments of the order of @xmath020  km  s@xmath4 with respect to the main cloud .",
    "much higher velocities can be attained if sizable magnetic pressures are considered . moreover , in two objects for which complete measurements exists , qso  23591241 and sdss  j03180600 , the observed separation between kinematic components is well reproduced by magnetic field strengths of the order of @xmath122  mg .",
    "our model predicts that the detached fragments can be either faster or slower than the main cloud , as observed in felobal spectra .",
    "survival of the slower fragments depends on the geometry of the problem .",
    "we propose that the slower fragments may permeate the main cloud if they are clumpy with a small filling factor and/or if the magnetic surface tension of the clouds is large enough to make the clouds flow around each other .",
    "the physical effects presented here may not be exclusive to felobals , but could have implications in a variety of galactic and extragalactic phenomena .",
    "for example , in cataclysmic variables , variable stars with circumstellar envelopes such as @xmath123 carinae , and in the narrow line regions of agn ."
