    "it is well known that single - particle motion in atomic nuclei is strongly renormalized by the coupling to low - lying surface vibrations , which leads to the fragmentation of the single - particle strength and affects basic quantities like the level density at the fermi surface , the effective mass and the width of giant resonances [ 13 ] .",
    "recently , it has been shown that the induced interaction resulting from such a coupling ( phonon - induced interaction ) leads to pairing gaps which account for about half of the experimental values [ 4 ] . in what follows",
    "we shall refer to these calculations of the state - dependent pairing gap as the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer plus bloch - horowitz ( bcs+bh ) approximation , in keeping with the fact that this form of perturbation theory was used to calculate the induced interaction entering the gap equation and arising from the exchange of phonons between pairs of nucleons moving in time reversal states close to the fermi level . in these calculations ,",
    "empirical single - particle levels were used , and the interplay between core polarization and self - energy contributions , as well as the energy - dependence of the effective mass [ 2 ] was neglected .    in the present paper",
    "we take a step towards a more consistent calculation of the renormalization effects associated with the particle - vibration coupling phenomenon , treating self - energy and induced pairing interaction processes on equal footing ( cf . fig .",
    "1(a ) ) , by solving the dyson equation ( also called nambu - gorkov equation , cf .",
    "e.g. [ 5 ] ) , describing the motion of nucleons and their contribution to both normal and anomalous densities . moreover and following ref .",

    "no vertex corrections ( cf .",

    "1 ) have been considered in the present calculations , because in the case of @xmath1sn , the nucleus we use in the present paper to exemplify the theory , vertex correction contributions are found to change ( reduce ) the value of the state - dependent pairing gap around fermi level only modestly . which states that the contribution of the vertex renormalization graphs to the total electron - phonon coupling strength is smaller than the lowest - order strength by a factor @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a typical phonon energy , @xmath11 being the fermi energy measured from the bottom of the single - particle potential . because in the nuclear case @xmath12 36 mev and @xmath13 is of the order of few mev , the ratio above turns out to be approximately equal to @xmath14 . however , this estimate can hardly be considered quantitative , because of the marked shell structure displayed by the single - particle levels , and by the associated particle - vibration coupling matrix elements ( spin - flip vs. non spin - flip processes ) as well as the strong cancellation existing between effective mass and vertex correction contributions associated with core polarization phenomena ( cf . e.g. [ 3 ] ) . ]",
    "the dyson equation approach has been customarily used in condensed matter physics to deal with strong coupling superconductors ( cf .",
    "e.g. ref .",
    "[ 59 ] and refs . therein ) . in nuclear physics ,",
    "this scheme has also been used previously both in the case of nuclear matter and of finite nuclei [ 1015 ] , the work of ref .  [ 15 ] being close in spirit to the one discussed here . however in this reference the focus was set on applying the method to correct the phenomenological values of single - particle energies and of the pairing gap to avoid double counting arising in connection with particle - vibration coupling processes .",
    "furthermore , since we do not make use of the linear approximation adopted in that reference to solve the dyson equation , the present approach should be also able to deal with strong - coupling situations .    in section 2 we present the formalism used in solving the dyson equation . in section 3",

    "the state - dependent gap obtained using @xmath124 mev , plus the induced phonon interaction used in the previous section , is shown in fig .  4 ; the average pairing gap in the valence shell 1.46 mev is close to the experimental value .",
    "the strength @xmath125 mev should be compared with the value @xmath126 mev needed to obtain the experimental value using the monopole - pairing field ( [ sigma12p0 ] ) and ( [ sigma11p0 ] ) without any phonon coupling ( that is , performing a simple bcs calculation starting from the unperturbed single - particle spectrum with @xmath127 ) .",
    "the enhancement of the pairing gap due to the induced phonon interaction seems to be in contrast with the effect of the induced interaction in nuclear matter , where it usually decreases the pairing gap .",
    "in fact , in neutron matter the induced interaction takes place mostly through the exchange of @xmath128 excitations via the spin - spin part , @xmath129 , of the nucleon - nucleon force , which leads to a repulsive interaction , and tends to suppress the pairing gap . in the case of finite nuclei",
    "the absence of collectivity associated to the @xmath130 modes should make its contribution only marginal with respect to the effect of the strongly collective low - lying surface modes treated in this paper .    in order to get more insight in the result shown in fig .  4",
    ", we decompose the anomalous self - energy @xmath131 in the sum of two terms , including only the matrix elements of either the induced or the monopole interaction , @xmath132 the imaginary parts of @xmath133 and @xmath134 are negligible , and the real parts have the same sign .",
    "also the state - dependent pairing gap , defined as @xmath135 can then be separated into two contributions , @xmath136 with @xmath137 the monopole interaction has only a small effect on the values of @xmath138 , since the interaction does not act in the particle - hole channel : from tables 2 and 3 it can be seen that the values of @xmath139 obtained with or without the monopole interaction agree within 10% for all the valence orbitals . from table 3 it can also be seen that the pairing gaps @xmath140 receive similar contributions from @xmath141 and from @xmath142 , except for the fragmented level @xmath93 where the phonon gap is much larger . in particular , the values of @xmath141 are enhanced compared to those obtained in section 3 without the monopole interaction , and listed in table 2 .",

    "4 we compare the gaps obtained in the present calculations with a bcs+bh calculation of the kind performed in [ 4 ] , but including the same monopole interaction and the same effective particle - vibration couplings as used here .",
    "it is seen that the dyson calculation leads to gaps which are lower again by about 200 kev in average in the valence shell as compared to the bcs+bh results .",
    "this is because nucleons spend , in the dyson scheme , part of their time in more complicated configurations .",
    "one can conclude , that in the case studied the induced phonon interaction contributes substantially to pairing correlations : the strength of the monopole interaction , needed to obtain the experimental value of the pairing gap , is strongly reduced when the phonon contribution is included , as the gaps receive almost equal contributions from the monopole and from the induced interaction .",

    "<S> this result is also reflected in the fact that if one were to reproduce the observed @xmath2 allowing the nucleons to interact only through the bare monopole - pairing force , a value of @xmath4 mev ( @xmath5 mev ) is needed , 50% larger than the value @xmath6 mev ( @xmath7 mev ) needed in the full calculation . to keep in mind that the bare and the induced pairing contributions to @xmath2 enter the corresponding equations in a very nonlinear fashion . </S>",
    "<S> it is furthermore found that self - energy processes reduce the contribution of the phonon induced interaction to the pairing gap by @xmath8 as compared to the value obtained by only phonon exchange without taking into account the breaking of the single - particle strength .    </S>",
