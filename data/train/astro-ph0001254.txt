    "the recent detections of co emission at cosmological distances provide hints about the physical structure of newly formed objects ( @xcite and reference therein ) .",
    "a measure of the total gas and dust mass is indeed a very useful indicator of the object evolutionary status , because it provides an estimation of the fraction of the galaxy which has yet to be turned into stars at the epoch of observation . at high redshifts such measurements ,",
    "therefore , provide hints about the occurrence of active star - formation processes and help in investigating models of galaxy formation ( @xcite ) .",
    "only a handful of distant objects was detected so far in co , and most of them appear to be magnified by gravitational lenses ( table 1 ) . for these objects",
    "the mass of molecular gas inferred from the co intensities  corrected for gravitational amplification and using the galactic co to h@xmath3 conversion factor  turns out to be @xmath11 % of the total dynamical mass , with typical values of m(h@xmath3 ) @xmath12 m@xmath6 .",
    "these masses could be somewhat smaller if the co to h@xmath3 conversion factor were higher than in the galaxy .",
    "large quantities of co are expected when large fir luminosities and dust content are detected .",
    "most of the objects detected until now in co were indeed selected because they were dust  rich systems .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,^,^ , < \" , ]     @xmath13 : evidence for a lensed object    @xmath14 : corrected for magnification    hr10 belongs to the class of objects with very red colours ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "their faintness at optical / nir wavelengths makes the redshift determination and the investigation of their nature difficult even with 4 m class telescopes .",
    "hr10 is so far the only one with a measured spectroscopic redshift ( @xcite ) .",
    "one of the main issues regarding ergs is whether they are young and starbursting galaxies hidden in the optical by a large amount of dust or whether they are old passively evolving galaxies at @xmath16 .",
    "recent results indicate that both classes contribute to the population of ergs ( @xcite).hr10 was first detected in the submm / mm continuum with the iram 30 m equipped with the mpifr bolometer and with the jcmt equipped with the scuba double arrays ( @xcite ) .",
    "subsequent observations confirmed the submm detection of this galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "the inferred properties of this object show its extraordinary nature : its dust mass is @xmath17 m@xmath6 and its total fir luminosity in the range 10 2000 @xmath18 m rest  frame is @xmath19 l@xmath20 ( h@xmath21 mpc / km / s ) .",
    "this places hr10 in the class of the ultra - luminous infrared galaxies and suggests the presence of a star ",
    "forming object with a sfr of @xmath22 m@xmath6 yr@xmath7 or even higher .    in this paper",
    "we present co(2 - 1 ) and co(5 - 4 ) observations of hr10 made with the iram plateau de bure interferometer .",
    "the observations are described in sect .",
    "2 , the resulting detection of both lines are presented in sect .",
    "3 , while implications of these measurements are reported in sect .",
    "4 . throughout the paper",
    ", we adopt h@xmath23 mpc / km / s and q@xmath24 .",
    "the observations were done partly during the winter 1998 - 99 and partly during the summer of 1999 with the iram plateau de bure interferometer . a dual sis 3mm/1.3 mm receiver",
    "was used to observe simultaneously the co(2 - 1 ) ( redshifted in the 3 mm band ) and the co(5 - 4 ) ( redshifted in the 1.3 mm band ) lines . in both cases ,",
    "the 3 mm receiver was connected to two units of the correlator , providing a velocity coverage of about 850 km s@xmath7 , while 4 units were connected to the 1.3 mm receiver providing a velocity coverage of about 650 km s@xmath7 .",
    "the observations made during the winter 1998 - 99 assumed a redshift of @xmath25 deduced from the h@xmath8 line .",
    "this yields frequencies of @xmath26 ghz for the co(2 - 1 ) line and @xmath27 ghz for the co(5 - 4 ) line .",
    "both lines were detected , but blue - shifted by about 400 km s@xmath7 with respect to the h@xmath8 line and thus truncated .",
    "the observations were repeated during the summer 1999 with a new frequency setup : @xmath28 ghz and @xmath29 ghz for the co(2 - 1 ) and co(5 - 4 ) lines respectively .",
    "the observations were made in the cd configuration of the interferometer .",
    "the phase drifts were calibrated by observing the nearby quasars 1633 + 382 and 1732 + 389 every 20 minutes throughout the observations .",
    "the amplitude was calibrated with the quasars 3c273 , 3c345 and 2145 + 067 , and the compact  region mwc349 at the beginning and/or the end of each transit .",
    "the passband of the system was calibrated using 3c273 or 2145 + 067 . at 1.3 mm , the total useful integration time on source",
    "was about 9 hours during the winter 1998/99 , and 12 hours during the summer 1999 .",
    "more integration time was available at 3 mm because some additional data were obtained , marginal at 1.3 mm but of good quality at 3 mm .",
    "the 3 mm receiver was tuned in single side band , while the 1.3 mm was tuned in double side band , with the co(5 - 4 ) in the lower side band .",
    "the upper side band was then available to measure the continuum .",
    "three visibility tables were produced from the calibrated data : two spectral tables containing the co(2 - 1 ) and co(5 - 4 ) data respectively and one continuum table with the 1.3 mm continuum .",
    "the spectral data were smoothed in frequency to improve their signal - to - noise ratio : the velocity resolution of the co(2 - 1 ) data was smoothed to 50 km s@xmath7 and that of the co(5 - 4 ) to 75 km s@xmath7 .",
    "the uv tables were imaged , cleaned and restored with elliptical gaussian beams of @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) for the 3 mm and 1.3 mm data respectively .",
    "signal is detected in the central channels of both the co(2 - 1 ) and co(5 - 4 ) spectral data sets at 10 and 5 sigmas respectively .",
    "the averages of the channels with detected emission were used to produce the integrated maps shown on figs .",
    "1a and 1c .",
    "the co(2 - 1 ) integrated flux is 1.4 jy km s@xmath7 .",
    "there is no indication for any extension of the emission at this resolution .",
    "the peak of the source is offset by about @xmath34 from the position of the optical source as measured by hst ( @xcite ) .",
    "this offset is well within the astrometric accuracy of hst but if real it may be indicative of a spatial extinction .",
    "the corresponding co(2 - 1 ) profile ( fig 1b ) is roughly gaussian , with a fwhm of almost exactly 400 km s@xmath7 , and a central frequency that corresponds to a redshift of @xmath35 .",
    "the appearance of a flat - top or even double peak profile around @xmath36 km s@xmath7 ( see fig1b ) can not be checked with the present data and only observations at higher signal - to - noise ratio ( those exploiting the full spectral resolution ) can settle its reality .",
    "the line - width observed is fairly large , although not atypical for this kind of sources ( e.g. smmj02399 , frayer et al . 1998 ) and could be due either to an edge - on system or to various separate components .",
    "the redshift deduced from the co line is apparently shifted from that deduced from the h@xmath8 line ( @xmath37 ) , but corresponds to the redshift deduced from the [ ] line at 3727    ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "this shift is still within the uncertainties in the optical redshift but if real it would be different from what is typically found for low redshift luminous galaxies ( @xcite ) , where systematic blue - ward offsets of optical lines from the co redshift are attributed to outflows with dust obscuration ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the question remains , however , completely open since a recent analysis by mcintosh et al .",
    "( 1999 ) of a sample of quasars shows how high - redshift objects present h@xmath39 lines with a systematic mean red - ward shift of @xmath40 500 km / s with respect to the systemic redshift of the objects ( that defined by the narrow line region ) . even though the comparison with quasars may not be fair since the line emitting regions could be different , hr10 seems to show similar properties with the co redshift corresponding to that of the narrow forbidden lines and coinciding with the centre of mass of the system , while the h@xmath8 line is shifted with respect to that .    the integrated map corresponding to the co(5 - 4 ) map ( fig .",
    "1c ) shows a source at the same position as the co(2 - 1 ) integrated map .",
    "the integrated intensity of that source ( corrected for the contribution of the continuum ) is 1.35 jy km s@xmath7 .",
    "the corresponding co(5 - 4 ) profile ( fig .",
    "1d ) is roughly gaussian , with a fwhm of 380 km s@xmath7 similar to that of the co(2 - 1 ) profile .",
    "the central frequency corresponds to a redshift of @xmath41 similar to that deduced from the co(2 - 1 ) line .",
    "although the co @xmath42 level is @xmath43 above the ground state the integrated flux ( in jy km s@xmath7 ) of co(5 - 4 ) is equal to that of the co(2 - 1 ) line , @xmath44 .",
    "co luminosities , in solar units , are @xmath45 and @xmath46 l@xmath6 for the co(2 - 1 ) and co(5 - 4 ) line respectively , while the total line luminosities  are @xmath47 and @xmath48 k km s@xmath7 pc@xmath49 @xmath50 , for the co(2 - 1 ) and co(5 - 4 ) line respectively .",
    "when expressed in these latter units , the ratio between the co(2 - 1 ) and co(5 - 4 ) luminosities of the same source is proportional to the line intrinsic brightness ( rayleigh - jeans ) temperature ratio integrated over the area of the source : @xmath51}{t_{\\rm b}[{\\rm co(2 - 1 ) } ] } = \\frac{l^\\prime_{\\rm co } ( 5 - 4 ) } { l^\\prime _ { \\rm co } ( 2 - 1 ) } \\cdot \\frac { \\omega_{\\rm s } ( 2 - 1)}{\\omega_{\\rm s } ( 5 - 4)}\\ ] ]    where @xmath52 is the source solid angle . if the spatial extent of the co(5 - 4 ) emission region is similar to that of the co(2 - 1 )",
    " a plausible hypothesis since both transitions have same line - width and profile  @xmath53 and corresponds to a value of the excitation temperature of @xmath54 k ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if gas and dust are in thermodynamic equilibrium the kinetic temperature @xmath55 would equal @xmath56 , but it is usually found that @xmath57 . in hr10 the dust temperature",
    "was estimated to be @xmath58 ( @xcite ) and this value can be taken as the upper limit to the gas temperature . if we assume that @xmath59 k the gas density implied by this ratio is less than @xmath60 . as an example , at @xmath61 k and @xmath62 k the estimated excitation temperature is @xmath63 k for a co density of @xmath64 .",
    "the present data can not distinguish between a picture where the dominant component of the ism in this system is a diffuse ( @xmath65 ) gas or whether the medium is clumpy .",
    "the spatial shift between the co and h@xmath8 lines would be more compatible with this latter picture .",
    "if the ratio between  and the mass of molecular gas is similar in hr10 and arp 220 ( @xcite ) , the molecular gas mass in hr10 , using the co(2 - 1 ) line , is @xmath66 , larger than what is usually found in local ulirgs ( @xcite ) but similar to that of other detected high - z sources ( @xcite ) .",
    "the 1.3 mm continuum map shows only a marginal ( @xmath67 ) detection at the position of the source , with an integrated flux of @xmath68 mjy beam@xmath7 .",
    "the flux detected with the iram 30 m telescope was @xmath69 mjy ( @xcite ) at 240 ghz . scaling the flux as @xmath70",
    ", the pdbi detection would correspond to an expected flux of @xmath71 mjy at the observed frequency of the 30 m .",
    "we exclude that this discrepancy is due to an extended component ; it is more likely due to the difference in the calibration of the two instruments since the two values are consistent within the error bars .",
    "the analysis of the spectral energy distribution of hr10 shows the presence of thermal emission at rest - frame @xmath72 with a range of dust temperatures between 30 and 45 k. the implied total dust mass is @xmath73 m@xmath6 ( for a dust emissivity index @xmath39 of 2 , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore the resulting gas - to - dust mass ratio for hr10 ranges between 200 and 400 , as local spirals ( @xcite ) , ulirgs ( @xcite ) and also sub - mm selected luminous sources show ( @xcite ) .",
    "the total rest - frame far - ir luminosity in the range @xmath74 is @xmath75 l@xmath6 ( @xcite ) as estimated taking into account the iso upper limits at 90 and 170 @xmath76 ( @xcite ) . when these latter are not considered and the 450 @xmath76 detection is included the luminosity turns out to be a factor of 3 larger ( @xcite ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath77 lies therefore in the range @xmath78 ( k km s@xmath7 pc@xmath49)@xmath7 , which agrees with the relation found for nearby luminous galaxies ( @xcite ) , whose emission is mainly powered by star - formation .",
    "objects whose fir emission is dominated by an agn  as the hyperluminous infrared galaxies  show much larger @xmath79 and do not even show up in co ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this indicates that the overall fir emission by hr10 is dominated by star formation .",
    "assuming that most of the fir luminosity is due to recent ob star formation activity , the star formation rate turns out to be @xmath80 m@xmath6/yr.star formation efficiency is usually measured by the ratios @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( see e.g. @xcite ) . while the former shows indeed quite a high value ( @xmath83 ) similar to that of merging local systems ( @xcite ) , the latter is of only 0.007 and very likely indicates a large extinction affecting the h@xmath8 emission .",
    "the large value of gas conversion into stars ( with respect to local galaxies ) could be consistent with two possible scenarios : either a genuinely young galaxy in the process of active star - formation ( and the detected amount of gas seems enough to feed it ) , or the presence of a large amount of gas could be the result of a merging process of two discs ( in this latter case the resulting galaxy will have a mass of a present - day massive elliptical ) .",
    "most of the properties of hr10 suggest that the ` locus ' , which best characterizes it , is that of local ulirgs ( @xcite ) .",
    "hr10 follows also the expected tight correlation between the infrared flux and the radio continuum : in fact the logarithmic ratio of fir ( 60 @xmath76 ) and radio ( 1.5ghz ) continuum flux density ( in hr10 rest - frame ) @xmath85 again falls within the value of nearby starbursts ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the ratio between the line ( 2 - 1 ) and ( 5 - 4 ) and the fir luminosities , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , agree with a model of co emission in high redshift galaxies , based on an extrapolation of the properties of local ulirgs ( @xcite ) .    with the detected line width and the upper limit on the co source size , given by the effective beam width @xmath88 , the upper limit to the total dynamical mass contained within the co emitting region is :      where @xmath90 is the observed deconvolved line width , @xmath91 is the inclination and @xmath92 is the linear diameter of the source ( @xmath93 ) . the resulting dynamical mass is a factor of 5 larger than the estimation of the molecular mass .",
    "the two values would coincide if the co emission were concentrated within the inner 10 kpc .",
