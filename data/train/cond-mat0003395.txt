    "the discovery of a metal - insulator transition ( mit ) in the two - dimensional electron gas in si - mosfets @xcite has induced renewed attention to the transport properties of disordered electrons .",
    "this mit is in conflict with the theory of localization for _ non - interacting _ electrons which predicts that all states are localized in 2d .",
    "the electron density in the si - mosfets is very low which makes the electron - electron interaction particularly important .",
    "thus it is generally assumed that some type of interaction effect is responsible for this mit .",
    "one of the most remarkable findings about the mit in si - mosfets is that an in - plane magnetic field ( which does not couple to the orbital motion of the electrons ) strongly suppresses the conducting phase @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the spin degrees of freedom play an important role for the transition .",
    "a complete understanding has , however , not yet been obtained .",
    "there have been attempts to explain the experiments based on the perturbative renormalization group @xcite , non - perturbative effects @xcite , or the transition being a superconductor - insulator transition rather than a mit @xcite .    in order to attack the problem of disordered interacting electrons",
    "numerically we have developed @xcite an efficient method , the hartree - fock based diagonalization ( hfd ) which is related to the quantum - chemical configuration interaction approach .",
    "we have used this method to study the influence of interactions on the conductance in one @xcite , two @xcite , and three @xcite dimensions .",
    "we found a delocalizing tendency of the interactions for strong disorder but a localizing one for weak disorder .",
    "similar results have been obtained by means of the density - matrix renormalization group @xcite in one dimension and exact diagonalization in two dimensions @xcite . since in most of the numerical work in the literature spinless electrons",
    "were considered , there are not many results about the importance of the spin degrees of freedom .    in this work",
    "we address this question by generalizing the hfd method to spinful electrons .",
    "we then use it study the influence of the spin degrees of freedom on the kubo - greenwood conductance .",
    "the generic model for _ spinless _ interacting disordered electrons is the quantum coulomb glass @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use a straight - forward generalization of the quantum coulomb glass to spinful electrons .",
    "it is defined on a regular hypercubic lattice with @xmath0 ( @xmath1 is the spatial dimensionality ) sites occupied by @xmath2 electrons ( @xmath3 ) . to ensure charge neutrality",
    "each lattice site carries a compensating positive charge of @xmath4 .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the creation and annihilation operators at site @xmath8 and spin @xmath9 , and @xmath10 denotes all pairs of nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "@xmath11 is the strength of the hopping term , i.e. , the kinetic energy , and @xmath12 is the occupation number of spin state @xmath9 at site @xmath8 .",
    "we parametrize the interaction @xmath13 by its value @xmath14 between nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "the coulomb repulsion between two electrons at the same site is described by the hubbard interaction @xmath15 the random potential values @xmath16 are chosen independently from a box distribution of width @xmath17 and zero mean .",
    "the boundary conditions are periodic and the coulomb interaction is treated in the minimum image convention ( which implies a cut - off at a distance of @xmath18 ) .    a numerically exact solution of a quantum many - particle system requires the diagonalization of a matrix whose dimension increases exponentially with system size .",
    "this severely limits the possible sample sizes . in order to overcome this problem",
    "we have developed the hfd method .",
    "the basic idea is to work in a truncated hilbert space consisting of the corresponding hartree - fock ( slater ) ground state and the low - lying excited slater states . for each disorder configuration",
    "three steps have to be performed : ( i ) find the hartree - fock solution of the problem , ( ii ) determine the @xmath19 slater states with the lowest energies , and ( iii ) calculate and diagonalize the hamilton matrix in the subspace spanned by these states .",
    "the number @xmath19 of new basis states determines the quality of the approximation , reasonable values have to be found empirically .",
    "the conductance of a quantum many - particle system can be obtained from linear - response theory .",
    "it is essentially determined by the current - current correlation function of the ground state .",
    "the real ( dissipative ) part of the conductance ( in units of @xmath20 ) is given by the kubo - greenwood formula @xcite , @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the frequency .",
    "@xmath23 is the @xmath24 component of the current operator and @xmath25 denotes the eigenstates of the hamiltonian .",
    "( [ eq : kubo ] ) describes an isolated system while in a real d.c .",
    "transport experiment the sample is connected to contacts and leads .",
    "this results in a finite life time @xmath26 of the eigenstates leading to an inhomogeneous broadening @xmath27 of the @xmath28 functions in ( [ eq : kubo ] ) @xcite . to suppress the discreteness of the spectrum of a finite system",
    ", @xmath29 should be at least of the order of the single - particle level spacing . for our systems",
    "this requires a comparatively large @xmath30 .",
    "we tested different @xmath29 and found that the conductance _ values _",
    "depend on @xmath29 but the qualitative results do not .",
    "the main results of this paper are summarized in fig.[fig : conductance ] which shows the disorder and interaction dependence of the typical conductance for both spinless and spinful electrons on a two - dimensional lattice of @xmath31 sites .",
    "the qualitative behavior in both cases is similar : in the strongly localized regime ( small @xmath11 ) a moderate interaction delocalizes the electrons while a sufficiently strong interaction always strongly suppress the conductance .",
    "this is the precursor of a wigner crystal or wigner glass . with decreasing disorder ( increasing @xmath11 )",
    "the interaction - induced enhancement of the conductance also decreases and eventually vanishes .",
    "the behavior of the conductance can be attributed to the competition of two effects : first , the interactions destroy the phase of the electrons and thus the interference necessary for localization .",
    "this is particularly effective if the localization length is small to begin with .",
    "second , the interactions introduce an additional source of randomness which tends to increase the localization .",
    "a comparison of the cases of spinless and spinful electrons shows that the interaction induced delocalization is significantly larger for spinful electrons .",
    "moreover , the enhancement seems to vanish at a larger kinetic energy ( which we did not reach in the simulations ) .",
    "a systematic investigation of the dependence of the conductance on @xmath14 and @xmath15 will be published elsewhere .    in summary , we have studied the influence of electron - electron interactions on anderson localization for spinless and spinful electrons in two dimensions . for strong disorder moderate interactions significantly enhance the transport .",
    "this enhancement is much stronger for spinful than for spinless electrons .",
    "identifying a real phase transition and thus establishing a connection between these findings and the experiments on si - mosfets requires a finite - size scaling analysis of the conductance .",
    "this remains a task for the future .",
