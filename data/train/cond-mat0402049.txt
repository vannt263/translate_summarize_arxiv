    "in recent years it has become increasingly clear that the emergence of non - trivial collective phenomena in systems of heterogeneous interacting agents ( e.g. markets , information networks , or ecosystems ) presents deep analogies with the occurrence of phase transitions in disordered statistical systems , when heterogeneities in the former can be mapped onto disorder variables in the latter .",
    "the ideas and techniques of mean - field spin - glass theory @xcite play a major role in the current studies of multi - agent systems . as happened in other interdisciplinary applications of spin - glass theory from neural networks @xcite to computer science @xcite , the effectiveness of these methods in economics - inspired problems can go well beyond the purely technical level .",
    "some issues like the emergence of collective phenomena in evolving populations of competing agents have already started to be elucidated via spin - glass type of ideas ( see e.g. the literature on the minority game @xcite ) .",
    "another intriguing class of problems arising in economics where such a potential can be fully expressed concerns the characterization of the equilibria of heterogeneous economies .    in a nutshell , economic equilibria are optimal microscopic states of an economy in which ( a ) all economic agents maximize their respective payoffs ( firms maximize profits and consumers maximize utilities ) and ( b ) the prices of goods are such that the total demand and the total supply of each commodity match exactly @xcite .",
    "microscopic degrees of freedom are typically the scale of production of firms and the level of consumption of consumers , while technologies and endowments or utility functions are heterogeneous across firms and consumers respectively .",
    "the central problem is extracting robust macroeconomic properties and laws that can be tested against observed patterns of real economies .",
    "heterogeneities complicate things considerably from a theoretical viewpoint .",
    "the traditional approach of economics is based on the so - called representative agent description , in which each class of economic agents ( firms and consumers ) is substituted by a single , `` average '' agent whose characteristics are , to a large extent , postulated .",
    "an alternative pathway consists in modeling heterogeneities through randomness @xcite . while this approach has drawn heavily from tools of statistical mechanics , mainly via analogies with random field models",
    "@xcite , the possibility of systematically employing statistical mechanics to clarify the statistical structure of economic equilibria has only been partially explored thus far .    in this work , we apply spin - glass techniques to the study of a random production economy assuming that technologies ( i ) are random vectors , ( ii ) are to some degree inefficient and ( iii ) can be operated at any ( non - negative ) scale . within this framework , which is standard in economics @xcite , it is possible to _ derive _ an effective - agent problem whose solution embodies that of the original multi - agent problem .",
    "key macroeconomic quantities such as averages and distributions of prices , operation scales and consumptions can be computed exactly .",
    "remarkably , they turn out to be either directly connected or easily derived from the spin - glass order parameters that naturally arise in calculations .",
    "consequently , a macroeconomic picture emerges naturally from microeconomic interactions and the corresponding phase structure can be fully characterized",
    ".    our emphasis in this paper will be mainly on ` physical ' properties of the model ( e.g. phase transitions ) , so we will not analyze the behavior of such quantities as the gross domestic product of the economy . for a more articulated economic discussion , we refer the reader to @xcite , where a slightly simpler model than the one presented here is studied in a fully economic perspective .",
    "the outline of this work is hence as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we expound the formal aspects of the multi - agent problem and outline the spin - glass approach",
    ". two types of economies are considered : those with strictly inefficient technologies and those whose technologies are inefficient _ on average_. these two situations give rise to strikingly different macroscopic properties .",
    "the former choice yields a more realistic economic picture and a non - trivial physical scenario , which is thoroughly analyzed in sec .",
    "3 . in the latter case",
    ", the economy displays simpler but less realistic properties , that are the subject of sec .",
    "4 . finally , in sec . 5",
    ", we fomulate our conclusions and discuss some possible directions for further work .",
    "the definitions of our model parallel those employed in the theory of economic equilibria , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "we consider an economy with @xmath0 firms or industries and @xmath1 commodities .",
    "each industry is endowed with a technology or activity that allows the transformation of some commodities ( `` inputs '' ) into others ( `` outputs '' ) .",
    "technologies are denoted as @xmath1-dimensional vectors @xmath5 , where negative ( resp .",
    "positive ) components represent quantities of inputs ( resp . outputs ) .",
    "furthermore , each firm can operate its technology at a scale @xmath6 , meaning that when run at scale @xmath7 the industry @xmath8 produces or consumes a quantity @xmath9 of commodity @xmath10 .",
    "the profit of firm @xmath8 is @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the price vector , which we assume to be non - negative .",
    "each firm chooses @xmath7 by solving @xmath13 at fixed prices .",
    "produced goods are bought by consumers to satisfy their needs . here",
    "we consider the case of a single consumer ( ` society ' ) endowed with an initial bundle of goods @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and with a prescribed utility function @xmath16 ( ` welfare ' ) .",
    "the consumer selects the desired consumption @xmath17 by solving @xmath18 at fixed prices .",
    "@xmath19 denotes the consumer s budget set .",
    "we specialize here to the case of a separable utility : @xmath20 which simplifies the analysis considerably .",
    "we assume in this way that commodities are _ a priori _ equivalent for the consumer . while our calculations hold in general for @xmath21 s such that @xmath22 and @xmath23 , for numerical calculations we set @xmath24 .",
    "equilibria are defined as microscopic configurations @xmath25 , with @xmath26 and @xmath17 , that solve ( [ maxf ] ) and ( [ maxc ] ) and such that @xmath27 the above `` market - clearing '' condition ensures that the total demand of each good , @xmath28 , matches the total supply @xmath29 .",
    "we concentrate on the limit of large economies , namely @xmath2 , @xmath30 , @xmath3 fixed .",
    "the consumer s initial endowments @xmath31 are assumed to be sampled independently from a distribution @xmath32 .",
    "the complexity of the production processes is modeled by postulating that technologies @xmath33 are quenched random vectors . in order to avoid unrealistic features , it is crucial to impose that it is not possible to produce , by some combination of the available technologies , a positive amount of some commodity without consuming a positive amount of some other commodity ( `` impossibility of the land of cockaigne '' @xcite ) .",
    "we enforce this condition in two ways .",
    "hard - constrained technologies . : :    the @xmath34 s are taken to be gaussian random    variables with zero mean and variance @xmath35    satisfying    @xmath36 the parameters @xmath37    measure the inefficiency of the transformation process of    technologies , i.e. the difference between the total quantity of inputs    and the total quantity of outputs . soft - constrained technologies . : :    the @xmath34 s are taken to be gaussian random    variables with mean @xmath38 and variance    @xmath35 .    these two choices give rise to very different macroscopic properties . in both cases , we further assume that @xmath39 and that @xmath40 is drawn from a distribution @xmath41 independently for each @xmath8 .    the parameters that ultimately regulate the economy s equilibria are thus @xmath4 and @xmath42 , together with the functions @xmath43 , @xmath32 and @xmath41 .    as said above , in this setup commodities are statistically equivalent in all respects . hence , this model focuses on the ability of the economy to produce scarce goods using abundant goods as inputs .",
    "our aim is thus to understand how the global level of prosperity , measured by the utility of the consumer and by the amount of economic activity , increases as the repertoire of available technologies expands .      in the following ,",
    "we shall generally denote by brackets @xmath44 the average over a random variable @xmath45 , irrespective of its distribution .    to begin with ,",
    "let us observe that the problem of finding the equilibrium of the economy ultimately takes the form @xmath46 this is self - evident from the consumer s viewpoint .",
    "but if ( [ maxu ] ) is solved , the firms profit maximization is solved too . indeed , taking the partial derivative of @xmath47 with respect to @xmath7 we find @xmath48 where we used the fact that the consumer s utility maximization , subject to the budget constraint , implies that @xmath49 for some lagrange multiplier @xmath50 .",
    "this is the content of the first welfare theorem @xcite : the market achieves an allocation of resources that is simultaneously optimal for all participants .",
    "( [ maxu ] ) is a standard problem in statistical mechanics , which can be solved by introducing a fictitious temperature , building a partition function with @xmath51 in place of the hamiltonian , and then letting the temperature to zero . in order to cope with the disorder ( either hard- or soft - constrained ) ,",
    "it is necessary to introduce replicas before averaging .",
    "this standard procedure generates macroscopic order parameters such as @xmath52 where the indices @xmath53 run over replicas .",
    "the convexity properties of @xmath47 ensure that the solution of the maximization problem is unique .",
    "this implies that the replicated partition function , which in the limit @xmath2 can be computed via a simple saddle - point integration , is dominated by replica - symmetric saddles where @xmath54 ( in spin - glass jargon , @xmath55 represents the self - overlap while @xmath56 is the analog of the edwards - anderson order parameter ) . here , we will leave routine calculations aside ( details of a very similar calculation can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "let it suffice to say that after taking the thermodynamic limit @xmath2 , the replica limit @xmath57 , and the limit of zero temperature , one arrives at an expression of the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a vector of order parameters and @xmath60 means that the solution is provided by the saddle point of the function @xmath61 , i.e. by the vector @xmath62 that solves the equation @xmath63 .",
    "the function @xmath61 depends in this case on the type of disorder @xmath64 one is considering .",
    "we shall first focus on the case of hard - constrained technologies , for which a well - behaved solution exists for all @xmath4 , as long as @xmath65 .",
    "such a solution exhibits two regimes , separated by a phase transition in the limit @xmath66 . for small values of @xmath4 ,",
    "when few technologies are available , the economy possesses many unexploited productive opportunities and the introduction of new technologies increases the productivity of existing ones . for larger values of @xmath4 ,",
    "the economy enters a mature phase , where the productive sector is largely saturated by existing technologies .    in the soft - constrained case , instead , the economy becomes unstable as the average scale of production diverges for @xmath4 larger than a critical @xmath42-dependent threshold .",
    "we will show explicitly that such an instability is related to the fact that , above this threshold , it is possible ( with probability one ) to combine existing technologies in order to produce outputs without using inputs .",
    "if all technologies are strictly inefficient ( i.e. if , for each @xmath8 ,",
    "@xmath67 ) , one finds that equilibria are described by the saddle point of @xmath68}\\right\\rangle}_{t , y}+\\nonumber\\\\ + n{\\left\\langle{\\max_{s\\geq 0}{\\left}[-\\frac{1}{2}\\delta\\widehat{\\chi}s^2 + st\\sqrt{\\delta(\\gamma - p^2)}-s\\eta p\\sqrt{\\delta}{\\right}]}\\right\\rangle}_{t,\\delta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is a unit gaussian random variable , and averages over @xmath70 and @xmath71 are performed with distributions @xmath32 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "the representative - agent problem embodying the equilibrium structure of the multi - agent economy is rather clear .",
    "the first maximization problem on the r.h.s . can be interpreted as an effective - utility maximization by the consumer with respect to the consumption of a single `` representative '' commodity .",
    "the second one corresponds instead to effective - profit maximization by a `` representative '' company with respect to its operation scale .",
    "the two problems are interconnected in a non - trivial way by the other terms .",
    "the solutions @xmath72 and @xmath73 of the effective problems as functions of the random variables @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively , are given by @xmath76 and @xmath77 notice that the equilibrium consumption @xmath78 is non - negative as long as @xmath79 diverges when @xmath80 .",
    "notice also that the dependence of the equilibrium scale @xmath81 on @xmath71 is described by @xmath82 moreover , by introducing the re - scaled variable @xmath83 the dependence of ( [ effe ] ) on @xmath71 disappears .",
    "this simple scaling will greatly simplify our discussion of the effects induced by heterogeneities in @xmath71 ( next section ) .    using the shorthand @xmath84 and a little algebra ,",
    "the saddle - point conditions can be seen to take the following form : @xmath85}\\label{sigma}\\\\ \\widehat{\\chi}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{nq}}{\\left\\langle{t u'(x^*)}\\right\\rangle}_{t , y}\\label{chihat}\\\\ q={\\left\\langle{(s^*)^2\\delta}\\right\\rangle}_{t,\\delta}\\label{q}\\\\ \\chi=\\frac{n}{\\sigma}{\\left\\langle{t s^*\\sqrt{\\delta}}\\right\\rangle}_{t,\\delta } \\label{chi}\\\\ \\kappa = p\\chi+n\\eta{\\left\\langle{s^*\\sqrt{\\delta}}\\right\\rangle}_{t,\\delta}\\label{kappa}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the next sections we shall discuss the generic properties of the above saddle - point problem and the corresponding phase structure .",
    "the meaning of the macroscopic order parameters and of the saddle - point conditions can be easily found with at most some basic algebra .",
    "* equation ( [ p ] ) implies that the order parameter @xmath86 is the average ( relative ) price , while @xmath87 ( see ( [ sigma ] ) ) measures ( relative ) price fluctuations .",
    "this is so because utility maximization under budget constraint gives @xmath88 with @xmath50 a lagrange multiplier that can be set to @xmath89 without any loss of generality .",
    "evaluating this at the saddle point gives precisely ( [ p ] ) .",
    "* averaging the expression in ( [ xstar ] ) over @xmath69 and @xmath70 and expressing @xmath90 via ( [ kappa ] ) one finds @xmath91 this equation can also be obtained by averaging the market clearing condition ( [ mc ] ) over technologies taking ( [ constraint ] ) into account .",
    "hence ( [ mcra ] ) can be seen as the macroeconomic analog of ( [ mc ] ) .",
    "* it is possible to show via elementary manipulations @xcite that @xmath92 remembering that @xmath93 is the relative price at equilibrium , this equation implies that the consumer saturates his / her budget when choosing his / her consumption .",
    "this law , known in economics as walras law @xcite , is a generic consequence of the microscopic setup of economic equilibria .",
    "the fact that it can be retrieved from our macroscopic saddle - point problem constitutes a significant consistency check .",
    "the distribution of operation scales @xmath94 provides important information , for it can be seen as a proxy for the distribution of firm sizes ( either in terms of revenues or in terms of the number of employees ) .",
    "its calculation in our model can be carried out with the help of ( [ scaling ] ) .",
    "in fact , one has @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the distribution of operation scales at fixed @xmath71 .",
    "the latter can be derived from ( [ sstar ] ) and from the ( gaussian ) distribution of @xmath69 : @xmath97 with @xmath98\\ ] ] the fraction of active firms ( i.e. firms such that @xmath99 ) , which is independent of @xmath71 .",
    "now ( [ scaling ] ) implies that @xmath100 so that @xmath101 where we simply set @xmath102 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath103 for large @xmath104 is related to the behavior of @xmath41 for small @xmath71 . in particular , if @xmath105 for @xmath106 , then @xmath107 for @xmath108 , which agrees with the power law behavior found empirically for the distribution of firm sizes @xcite .",
    "the distribution of equilibrium consumptions at fixed endowments can be computed from ( [ xstar ] ) via the distribution of @xmath69 .",
    "one gets @xmath109 as before , the equilibrium distribution of consumptions is given by @xmath110    likewise , it is also possible to compute , via the simple change of variable @xmath111 , the equilibrium distribution of prices .",
    "if the spread of initial endowments becomes vanishingly small , the amount of productive activity is expected , quite intuitively , to vanish too . in order to see this",
    ", one can proceed as follows .",
    "let the initial endowment be expressed as @xmath113 with @xmath114 a ( small ) r.v . with zero average and @xmath115 a positive number , and let @xmath116 anticipating that @xmath117 will be a small quantity when @xmath118 , we can write to leading order @xmath119 likewise , @xmath120 ^ 2{\\left}({\\left\\langle{\\psi^2}\\right\\rangle}_{t,\\zeta}- { \\left\\langle{\\psi}\\right\\rangle}^2_{t,\\zeta}{\\right})\\label{dc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] follow immediately from ( [ p ] ) , ( [ sigma ] ) and ( [ chihat ] ) .",
    "an expression for @xmath121 can be obtained from ( [ xstar ] ) via ( [ zazza ] ) : @xmath122\\simeq\\kappa+\\psi-\\zeta+t\\sqrt{nq}\\ ] ] separating terms of order @xmath123 from those proportional to @xmath121 , one has @xmath124 substituting ( [ psi ] ) into ( [ da ] ) , ( [ db ] ) and ( [ dc ] ) and carrying out the averages one gets @xmath125 in order to calculate @xmath55 , we can use ( [ nsigma ] ) .",
    "insertion into ( [ sstar ] ) yields @xmath126 , where @xmath127 in turn , from ( [ q ] ) we obtain @xmath128 where @xmath129 now ( [ nq ] ) and ( [ nqf ] ) together imply that @xmath130 for small @xmath131 so that , when @xmath132 , one can resort to an asymptotic expansion of @xmath133 for @xmath134 to calculate @xmath55 .",
    "this gives @xmath135 ^ 2 } { 2[u''({\\overline{y}})]^2{\\left\\langle{\\zeta^2}\\right\\rangle}_\\zeta}{\\right}]\\ ] ] so @xmath136 for @xmath132 with an essential singularity . in turn , by virtue of ( [ nsigma ] ) and ( [ phi ] ) , respectively , @xmath137 and @xmath138 for @xmath132 .",
    "hence when the spread of initial endowments decreases , economic activity vanishes very rapidly and no market activity takes place when initial endowments are all equal .      before discussing the actual solutions of the saddle - point equations as a function of @xmath4 and the corresponding economic picture ,",
    "let us briefly investigate the limit @xmath66 of marginally efficient technologies , in which the critical properties of the model can be elucidated in detail .",

    "let us then focus on the limit @xmath146 by studying the case @xmath147 .",
    "when there is an almost complete set of technologies ( i.e. when @xmath148 ) , goods can be transformed in almost all ways .",

    "this means that the typical scale of production diverges as @xmath155 when @xmath146 .",
    "a slightly more refined analysis is required to investigate the limit @xmath66 for @xmath143 . to simplify equations , for the remainder of this section we fix @xmath156 and resort to the notation introduced in the previous section , so that @xmath126 with @xmath157 and @xmath158 as defined in the equalities in ( [ namo ] ) and ( [ rinamo ] ) . again anticipating that , because the set of technologies is almost complete and efficient , the equilibrium consumption levels @xmath149 will fluctuate very little around the average @xmath115 ( i.e. @xmath159 )",

    "moreover , as @xmath170 for @xmath171 , it allows us to conclude that this solution holds for @xmath143 .",

    ", we found that for @xmath66 a critical value @xmath178 of @xmath4 exists such that @xmath179 while the typical scale of operations behaves as @xmath180 this shows that the behavior of the economy close @xmath181 for @xmath182 is totally analogous to that of a second - order phase transition in statistical physics .",
    "the analysis performed so far can be easily extended to negative values of @xmath42 . in this case",

    "the equilibrium is stable for @xmath186 , whereas equilibrium operation scales diverge as @xmath187 . once this has happened , initial endowments become irrelevant , so that @xmath183 is independent of @xmath32 .",

    "the distribution of consumptions preserves the character of the original distribution of endowments for low @xmath4 @xcite , while relative fluctuations stay roughly unchanged .",
    "when @xmath4 is close to @xmath210 , operation scales become larger and larger as @xmath42 decreases ( i.e. as technologies become more and more efficient ) and ultimately develop a singularity at @xmath210 in the marginally efficient limit @xmath66 ( see ( [ esseesse ] ) ) .",
    "the fluctuations of relative consumptions start to drop ( the sharper the lower is @xmath42 ) , as the distribution of consumptions becomes more and more peaked around the mean value . identifying abundant ( or scarce ) goods becomes increasingly hard .",

    "firms can not take advantage of the spread between scarce and abundant goods any longer , and technologies are subject to a much stronger selection . on the other hand , the average consumption starts growing with @xmath4 , as is expected in a competitive economy that selects highly efficient technologies .",
    "it is interesting to notice ( see @xcite for a more detailed economic discussion ) that while technological innovations ( i.e. increases of @xmath0 at fixed @xmath1 ) improve the global economic picture for @xmath212 , when @xmath208",

    "in particular , the average scale of operations diverges at a critical point that for @xmath218 is roughly @xmath219 .",
    "it is clear that such an economy is completely unrealistic .",
    "when @xmath215 diverges , the average relative price drops to zero , so that arbitrarily large consumptions can be achieved ( the reader can verify that relative price fluctuations are nevertheless finite above @xmath210 ) .",
    "we will show in the next section that this behaviour is due to the fact that for @xmath208 technologies can be combined in such a way that @xmath185 for all @xmath10 , i.e. that it is possible to produce every good without consuming .",
    "we will now proceed by calculating the typical volume of configuration space where technologies can be combined to yield @xmath185 for all @xmath10 . for a fixed disorder realization @xmath64",
    ", this volume is given by @xmath220 for @xmath212 , it is to be expected that @xmath221 is non - zero only with an exponentially small ( in @xmath0 ) probability , whereas the probability of it being finite becomes of order @xmath89 at @xmath210 .",
    "the typical volume is obtained from the quenched average of @xmath221 : @xmath222 we will focus in particular on the quantity @xmath223 ( analogous to a zero - temperature entropy in statistical physics ) . from the above discussion , we expect @xmath224 to be negative for @xmath212 and positive for @xmath208 , so that the critical point @xmath210 can be determined from the condition @xmath225 .    in principle , @xmath210 depends on @xmath42 and @xmath41 .",
    "notice , however , that because of the statistics of the @xmath34 s , a re - scaling @xmath226 makes the integral independent of @xmath40 s , apart from a trivial factor @xmath227 .",

    "the model we analyzed here is clearly unrealistic in many respects .",

    "a further extension to time dependent economies may provide interesting insights into economic growth theory .",
    "in particular , one can think about technological improvement as a dynamics of the @xmath34 s occurring on time scales much longer than those over which agents achieve equilibrium .",
