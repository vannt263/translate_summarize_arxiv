    "<S> we show that the effect of self - propulsion is sufficiently enough to generate crossing of high energy barrier . by assuming a random distribution of initial angles , we define a probability to cross the barrier of potential that matches with the data obtained by eddi _ </S>",

    "<S> the same qualitative behaviour is observed , therefore indicating that the crossing of the energy barrier originates from the rayleigh friction term rather than the specificity of the energy landscape ( in the low force limit ) . + </S>",
    "<S> this qualitative change can be revisited by looking directly at the flow in the velocity phase space [ see fig .  </S>",
