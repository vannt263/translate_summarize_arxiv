    "systems of particles governed by stochastic dynamics and exclusion interactions have been studied for a long time @xcite .",

    "the diffusion of a tagged particle , in a one dimensional system of brownian particles , interacting via hard core interaction is a model for the motion of a single molecule in a crowded one dimensional environment such as a biological pore or channel @xcite , and in experimentally studied physical systems such as zeolites @xcite , confined colloid particles @xcite and charged spheres in circular channels @xcite .",
    "since particles do not pass each other such diffusion processes are called single file diffusion .",
    "confinement of a tagged brownian particle , due to its interaction with other brownian particles , leads to a slow - down of the diffusion of the tagged particle @xmath6 instead of normal diffusion @xmath7 when the particles in the system are uniformly distributed @xcite .",
    "such many body problems can be treated using methods which exploit the relation between the dynamics of the interacting tagged particle and the motion of a particle free of interactions @xcite . in recent years at - least six new directions of research emerged .",
    "( i ) the effect of an external field acting on all the particles @xcite or on the tagged particle only @xcite has attracted attention since pores induce entropic barriers @xcite and are generally inhomogeneous . in this category the examples of single file motion in a periodic potential @xcite or in a box @xcite were considered in detail .",
    "( ii ) initial conditions may have a profound impact on diffusion of the tagged particle .",
    "for example if particles start as a narrow gaussian packet the diffusion of the tagged center particle increases linearly in time @xmath8 @xcite ( see details below ) .",
    "power law initial conditions induce @xmath9 and @xmath10 is neither @xmath11 nor @xmath12 @xcite ( see further details in text ) .",
    "when an external field is acting on the system , it is important to consider non uniform initial conditions where the density of particles is determined naturally from boltzmann s distribution .",
    "( iii ) in some investigations the underlying motion is not normal diffusion , instead the particles may be non - brownian , and following anomalous kinetics @xcite .",

    "( v ) interacting particles in systems with quenched disorder is yet another challenge .",
    "the motion of a tagged particle was recently treated in the context of single file diffusion in the sinai model @xcite .",

    "the diffusion constant of particles free of interaction is @xmath17 .",
    "as mentioned , towards the end of the paper we discuss the more general case where the dynamics between collision events is not necessarily brownian .",
    "an external potential @xmath15 acts on the particles .",

    "the initial conditions of @xmath22 particles residing initially to the right ( left ) of the test particle are drawn from the probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath30 @xmath31 respectively .",
    "we consider an ensemble of trajectories and average over trajectories and initial conditions ( see details below ) .",
    "our goal is to obtain the pdf of the position @xmath32 of the tagged center particle @xmath33 in the large @xmath22 limit .      a schematic diagram of the problem is presented in fig . [ fig1 ] for particles in a box .",
    "initial positions of particles are given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the label of the interacting particles ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the tagged particle whose coordinate is denoted with @xmath37 , is the center particle @xmath38 ( bold line in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "initially the tagged particle is at the origin @xmath39 . since particles do not pass each other , their order is clearly maintained , and the number of particles to the left and right of the tagged particle @xmath22 is fixed .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the straight line which starts at @xmath23 is called the jepsen line and follows @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is a test velocity @xcite .",

    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the tagged particle starts just to the right of the jepsen line so at @xmath42 the label of the particle to the right of the jepsen line is zero . in this system",
    "we have @xmath16 particles .",
    "hence initially we have @xmath22 particles to the left of the jepsen line and including the tagged particle @xmath43 particles to the right .",
    "let @xmath44 be the label number of the first particle situated to the right of the jepsen line . according to our rules , at @xmath42 we have @xmath45 , and",

    "is represented schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in one dimension",
    "a hard core collision event is equivalent to two particles that pass through each other , i.e. non interacting particles , and then after the particles cross each other , the labels of the pair of particles are switched ( see fig .",

    ", we let particles pass through each other , and then at time @xmath51 we label our particles ( or if we are interested only in tagged particle , locate the central particle ) .",
    "operationally this means that in the time interval @xmath52 we view the particles as non interacting , and then find the particle with @xmath22 particles to its right and @xmath22 to its left , which is equivalent to the tagged particle in the interacting system .",
    "hence the problem is related to the mathematical topic of order statistics @xcite as we will discuss briefly later .    following jepsen @xcite and levitt @xcite we introduce the stochastic process for the non interacting particles @xmath53",
    "where : + i ) if a particle crosses the jepsen line from left to right @xmath54 + ii ) if a particle crosses the jepsen line from right to left @xmath55 .",

    "<S> we study the diffusion of tagged hard core interacting particles under the influence of an external force field . using the jepsen line we map this many particle problem onto a single particle one . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain general equations for the distribution and the mean square displacement @xmath0 of the tagged center particle valid for rather general external force fields and initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> a wide range of physical behaviors emerge which are very different than the classical single file sub - diffusion @xmath1 found for uniformly distributed particles in an infinite space and in the absence of force fields . for symmetric initial conditions and potential fields </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the ( large ) number of particles in the system , @xmath4 is a single particle reflection coefficient obtained from the single particle green function and initial conditions , and @xmath5 its derivative . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this equation is related to the mathematical theory of order statistics and it can be used to find @xmath0 even when the motion between collision events is not brownian ( e.g. it might be ballistic , or anomalous diffusion ) . as an example we derive the percus relation for non gaussian diffusion . </S>"
