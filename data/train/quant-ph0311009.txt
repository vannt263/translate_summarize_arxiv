    "the effect of the phases can be completely mimicked by changes to @xmath43  @xcite .",
    "this does not carry over to our multi - coin history - dependent scheme .",

    "it is useful to consider the classical limit to our quantum scheme .",

    "as an example consider the @xmath63 case , with winning probabilities @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",

    "markov chain methods can not be used directly because of the history dependence of the scheme . if , however , we form the vector @xmath82,\\ ] ] where @xmath83 is the position at time @xmath84 , then @xmath85 forms a discrete time markov chain between the states @xmath86,\\ , [ -1,+1],\\ , [ + 1,-1]$ ] and @xmath87 $ ] with a transition matrix @xmath88 define @xmath89 to be the probability of @xmath90 , \\ ; i , j \\in \\{-1,+1\\}$ ] .",

    "the comparison with the classical history - dependent parrondo game requires @xmath77 . for game",
    "a , select the unbiased game , @xmath97 . for",
    "game b , choose , for example , @xmath98 or @xmath99 to produce a suitable bias ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - bias ] ) .",
    "the operators associated with a and b are applied repeatedly , in some fixed sequence , to the state @xmath100 .",
    "for example , the results of the game sequence aabb after @xmath84 time steps is @xmath101 figure  [ fig - newparrondo ] displays @xmath102 for various sequences . of sequences up to length four , with game",
    "b biased by @xmath103 only aabb and aab give a positive expectation , while when game b is biased by @xmath104 only aaab is positive .",
    "these results hold for @xmath47 up to approximately 0.6 , above which there are no positive sequences of length less than or equal to four .",
    "the sequences aabb and bbaa can be considered the same but with different initial states .",
    "that is , if instead of @xmath43 , we start with @xmath105 , bbaa gives the same results ( displaced by two time steps ) as aabb does with the original starting state . in the classical case , altering the order of the sequence results in the same trend but with a small offset , as one might expect .",
    "however , as fig .",
    "[ fig - newparrondo ] indicates , the change of order in the quantum case can produce radically different results .",
    "this feature also appears in meyer and blumer s quantum parrondo model .",
    "( 270,40)(0,0 )",
    "a scheme for a discrete quantum random walk with history dependence has been presented .",
    "our system involves the use of multiple quantum coins . by suitable selection of the amplitudes for coin",
    "flips dependent on certain histories , the walk can be biased to give positive or negative @xmath102 . in common with many other properties of quantum random walks , the bias results from interference , since the classical equivalent of our random walks are unbiased . with a starting state averaged over possible histories ,",
    "the average spread of probability density in our multi - coin scheme is slower than in the single coin case , with the appearance of multiple peaks in the distribution .",
    "for even numbers of coins there is a substantial probability of @xmath106 .",
    "however , the positions of the outer most peaks are the same as those of a single coin quantum random walk . as the memory effect increases , the dispersion of the quantum walk decreases .",
    "one may speculate that this feature may be relevant to an understanding of decoherence , here considered as loss of coherence within the central portion of the graph around @xmath106 .",
    "in particular , the dispersion in the wavefunction decreases as we move from a first - order markov system to a non - first - order markov system , that is , one with memory .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that the markovian approximations tend to over - estimate the decoherence of the system .",
    "our scheme is the quantum analog of the history - dependent game in a form of parrondo s paradox .",
    "the quantum history - dependent walk also exhibits a parrondo effect , where the disruption of the history dependence in a biased walk by mixing with a second , unbiased walk can reverse the bias . in distinction to the classical case , the effect seen here is very sensitive to the exact sequence of operations , a quality it shares with other forms of quantum parrondo s games .",
    "this sensitivity is consistent with the idea that the effect relies on full coherence over space and in time .",
    "we have only considered a quantum walk on a line .",
    "the effect of memory driven quantum walks on networks with different topologies and whether the memory structure can be chosen to optimize the path in such networks , are open questions .",
