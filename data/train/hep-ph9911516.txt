    "the ground state ( `` vacuum '' ) of non - abelian gauge theories like qcd is known to be very rich .",

    "the simplest building blocks of topological structure in the vacuum are  @xcite _ instantons _ with @xmath2 and _ anti - instantons _ with @xmath3 .",
    "instantons represent gluon field configurations that are localized ( `` instantaneous '' ) in euclidean time and space .",
    "while they are believed to play an important role in various long - distance aspects of qcd , there are also important short - distance implications . in qcd with @xmath4 ( light ) flavours , instantons induce hard processes violating _",

    "while in ordinary perturbative qcd ( @xmath7 ) these processes are forbidden , their experimental discovery would clearly be of basic significance .",
    "the deep - inelastic scattering regime is strongly favoured in this respect , since hard instanton - induced processes are both calculable  @xcite within instanton - pertubation theory and have good prospects for experimental detection at hera  @xcite .",
    "qcdins  @xcite is a monte carlo package for simulating qcd - instanton induced scattering processes in deep - inelastic scattering ( hera ) .",
    "it is designed as an `` add - on '' hard process generator interfaced by default to the monte carlo generator herwig  @xcite .",
    "it incorporates the theoretically predicted production rate for instanton - induced events as well as the essential characteristics that have been derived theoretically for the partonic final state of instanton - induced processes : notably , the flavour democratic  @xcite and isotropic  @xcite production of the final state partons , energy weight factors different for gluons and quarks  @xcite , and a high average multiplicity @xmath8 of produced partons with a ( approximate ) poisson distribution of the gluon multiplicity  @xcite .",
    "earlier versions of qcdins have been used already to establish first experimental bounds on the rate of instanton - induced events at hera  @xcite and to develop instanton search strategies  @xcite .    in the present report a comprehensive description is given of the theoretical framework built into the program ( section  [ theorie ] ) as well as of the various program components ( section  [ qcdins ] ) and of their usage ( section  [ usage ] ) .",

    "the colour flow is obtained simply by connecting the colour lines of adjacent partons within each of the above - mentioned @xmath4 @xmath60$]-``strings '' in a planar manner ( consistent with the leading order @xmath67 expectation ) .",
    "this choice is inspired by the leading - order partonic final state ( after averaging over colour )  @xcite , but may well deserve further research .",
