    "the problem we are going to study lies on the intersection of spectral theory and homogenization theory for partial differential operators .",
    "we recall that one of the central problems of homogenization theory is to study the asymptotic behaviour as @xmath0 of the solution @xmath14 to the problem @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a small parameter , @xmath17 , @xmath18 is a family of real measurable functions satisfying @xmath19 and becoming highly oscillating as @xmath0 .",
    "the typical example is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a fixed @xmath22-periodic function .",
    "it is well - known ( see , e.g , @xcite ) that if @xmath23 then the family @xmath24 is compact in @xmath25 , and if @xmath26 as @xmath27 then @xmath28 is a solution of the problem @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 is some bounded matrix - function , bounded away from zero , which depends , in general , on the subsequence @xmath32 .",
    "if @xmath20 then the whole sequence @xmath14 converges , and in this case @xmath31 is a constant matrix . as we see the limit differential operator has qualitatively the same form as the initial one provided holds .",

    "we refer to the monograph @xcite , where various problems of this type are studied .",

    "below we briefly present our main results .",
    "let @xmath8 be a bounded domain in @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) , @xmath16 be a small parameter .",
    "in @xmath8 we consider the operator @xmath45 subject to dirichlet boundary conditions on @xmath4 . here the functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 are bounded above and bounded away from zero uniformly in @xmath13 everywhere except a small neighbourhood of some hyperplane @xmath7 having non - empty intersection with the domain @xmath8 .",
    "more precisely , we denote by @xmath46 a family of thin spherical shells distributed periodically , with period @xmath13 , along @xmath7 ( counted by the parameter @xmath47 ) .",

    "we define the functions @xmath57 and @xmath58 as follows : @xmath57 is equal to @xmath59 for @xmath60 and equal to the constant @xmath61 for @xmath62 , @xmath58 is equal to @xmath59 for @xmath63 and equal to the constant @xmath64 for @xmath65 .",
    "operators of the form occur in various areas of physics .",
    "for example , in the case @xmath66 the operator @xmath9 governs the propagation of acoustic waves in a medium with mass density @xmath67 and compressibility @xmath68 .",
    "also , @xmath9 describes vibrations of a body occupying the domain @xmath8 , the functions @xmath57 and @xmath58 are its stiffness and mass density , correspondingly .",

    "asymptotics of eigenvibrations of a body with a mass density perturbed near a hypersurface was studied in a lot of papers  see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein .",
    "the case of simultaneously perturbed density and stiffness ( `` double - contrast '' ) was studied in @xcite ( see also @xcite , where the case of bulk distribution of double - contrast inclusions was studied ) . in all",
    "these works the geometry of a set supporting the perturbation differs essentially from that one considered in the current paper .    the spectrum @xmath70 of @xmath9 is purely discrete .",

    "we postpone the precise statement to section [ sec3 ] ( see remark [ remark_q ] ) because first we need to introduce some more notations .",
    "the finiteness of @xmath77 implies the uniform ( with respect to @xmath13 ) boundedness of the `` mass '' @xmath78 of @xmath79 , namely , using and the fact that @xmath50 , we obtain : @xmath80    in spite of the fact that @xmath9 contains many parameters the behaviour of its spectrum as @xmath0 depends essentially only on @xmath74 being finite or infinite and @xmath77 being positive or zero .    at this point",

    "also we note , that the choice of the boundary conditions on @xmath4 is not essential  instead of the dirichlet boundary conditions we can impose , for example , neumann or mixed ones .",
    "these conditions will be inherited by the limit spectral problem .    in the last part of the paper we consider the same problem for a waveguide - like domain @xmath8 : @xmath98 where @xmath99 , @xmath100 .",
    "here we are interested in the case @xmath101 , @xmath84 only .    due to the periodicity of @xmath9",
    "its spectrum is a locally finite union of compact intervals ( bands ) . in general the bands may overlap and the natural question arising here is whether gaps open up in the spectrum ( i.e. whether there is an open interval @xmath102 such that @xmath103 , while @xmath104 ) .",
    "this problem is interesting for applications since the presence of gaps is important for the description of wave processes which are governed by the differential operators under consideration .",
    "namely , if the wave frequency belongs to a gap , then the corresponding wave can not propagate in the medium without attenuation .",
    "this feature is a dominant requirement for so - called photonic crystals which are materials with periodic dielectric structure attracting much attention in recent years ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it was proved in @xcite that in the case @xmath105 and a bulk distribution of shells , the spectrum of @xmath9 has a gap when @xmath13 is small enough .",
    "our goal is to study whether gaps will open up in case of our waveguide - like domain .",
    "we will prove that the spectrum of @xmath9 converges in the hausdorff sense to the spectrum of some operator @xmath106 which is defined by the same differential expression as in the case of a bounded domain and its spectrum is as follows : if @xmath107 then @xmath108\\cup[{\\alpha}_2,\\infty),\\ ] ] otherwise @xmath109 .",
    "here @xmath110 are some positive numbers satisfying @xmath111 .",
    "thus if the waveguide is thin enough we have a gap in the spectrum of @xmath106 ( and , consequently , @xmath70 has a gap when @xmath13 is small enough ) .",
    "periodic perturbations of the laplacian in wavegide - like domains leading to opening of spectral gaps were also studied in @xcite . in all these papers ( except @xcite )",
    "spectral gaps appear because of a perturbation of the boundary of the waveguide ( for example by making small holes periodically distributed along the waveguide @xcite or by dividing the waveguide into two parts coupled by a periodic system of small windows @xcite ) . in the paper @xcite the authors considered small perturbations of the laplace operator in a cylindrical domain by second - order differential operators with periodic coefficients ; they gave sufficient conditions on this perturbation for gap opening .",
    "these conditions are not valid for the operators considered in the present work . in the paper",
    "@xcite the authors perturbed the laplace operator by a singular potential supported by a family of periodically distributed surfaces .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we set the problem and formulate the main result ( theorem [ th1 ] ) , also we prove the estimate ( theorem [ th2 ] ) .",
