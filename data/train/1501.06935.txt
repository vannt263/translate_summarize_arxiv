    "0.3 in sterile neutrinos ( whose existence is hinted by several experiments ) , if found , would inescapably play a revolutionary role in our understanding of particle physics .",
    "the now established fact of neutrino masses , highlights the incomplete theoretical understanding of the origin of neutrino mass .",
    "most models , of which there are many , invoke a heavy ( and sterile at ordinary energies ) neutrino state for the missing right - handed neutrinos , which in any case do not participate significantly in weak interactions at energies as yet probed ( less than a few hundredgev ) .",
    "definitive discovery of a sterile neutrino would point to the scale of physics responsible for neutrino mass , provide clues to the actual mechanism , potentially open a gateway to the dark sector , and be the first particle found outside the standard model .",
    "sterile neutrinos are well motivated over a wide range of parameter space , but there has been particular emphasis recently on sterile neutrinos in the 1ev mass range due to a variety of experimental hints  @xcite .    this white paper describes a unique project primarily designed to search for evidence of sterile neutrinos , but which possesses excellent potential for nuclear safeguard and other applications .",
    "the detector , called nulat ( short for neutrino lattice ) , is made possible by a natural synergy between the mini - lens and minitimecube programs .",
    "the goal of the mini - lens ( low - energy solar neutrino spectroscopy ) program has been to develop the `` raghavan optical lattice '' ( rol ) technology aimed primarily at low - energy solar - neutrino detection . excellent spatial and energy resolution of this technology combined with the custom , fast , digitizing electronics of minitimecube will allow a timely short - baseline reactor experiment sensitive to 1ev sterile neutrinos to be performed .",
    "rol technology will enable accurate measurement of the positron s energy in inverse beta decay ( ibd ) events while cleanly rejecting backgrounds via spatial and temporal coincidence of the ibd neutron tagging .",
    "described below are details of the minitimecube and lens programs and their merger .",
    "the minitimecube ( mtc ) group has constructed a two - liter neutrino detector to demonstrate the power of using fine pixels and fast timing to reconstruct detailed event topology in the ibd interaction coming from reactor antineutrinos , even in a scintillation medium ( previously believed to be useful for calorimetric measurement only , due to isotropy of emitted scintillation light ) .",
    "the next step in the timecube evolution has been projected to be a scale - up from the two - liter detector to a one - ton detector . with the evolution to a m@xmath3 scale and near surface location ,",
    "( necessitated by reactor locations ) , it was realized that a dominant problem in scaling up from two liters was going to be background rejection , a major challenge of any low - energy surface neutrino detector , especially in the close vicinity of a nuclear reactor .",
    "after extensive discussions and joint studies between the mtc collaboration and lens collaboration , the detector geometry concept of the lens collaboration has been adopted , as discussed below .",
    "the highly segmented lens geometry , by which individual cells in a cubical lattice are viewed from six sides , permits three dimensional , digital location of energy deposition within the detector .",
    "the unique 3d segmentation of lens provides superior background rejection and excellent resolution of the neutrino interaction observed in nulat simulations . as such , nulat is exceptionally well suited to precisely measure reactor antineutrino flux within a few meters from the reactor core , and perform a decisive test of small mixing angle oscillations ( at a few percent level ) of electron antineutrinos to a new sterile neutrino species ( proposed 4@xmath8 neutrino generation ) .",
    "such a breakthrough measurement has generated a worldwide interest with several experimental pursuits in parallel , to verify or falsify this hypothesis , with high stakes for being first with a clean measurement .    beyond the search for new physics , nulat has potential for multiple applications , ranging from technology demonstration for reactor monitoring purposes , precision ( to a few percent ) measurement of the antineutrino flux , national security applications , study of an apparent problem with the neutrino spectrum in the range of @xmath9mev , and training of young physicists .",
    "first , background information on sterile neutrinos is reviewed , followed by short baseline reactor physics and the reactor antineutrino anomaly ( raa ) , reactor flux measurements and predictions , anti - proliferation applications , directional sensitivity , and neutron detection applications .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : nulatdesign ] , general and detailed technical discussion of the new and unique rol design is presented .",
    "the design principles are clearly illustrated in the simulation of light channeling in a rol detector is shown in figure  [ fig : rol ] . a simulated light output on one face of the nulat detector and distribution of light per cell , due to 10mev deposition in the central cell is shown in figure  [ fig : xyface ] .",
    "similar output is expected on all six sides of the detector .",
    "the central cell along the axis from the event , has a much larger signal than adjacent cells even on a log scale , contributing to the powerful vertex reconstruction and energy localization , while effectively eliminating background gammas as discussed in detail later in the text .",
    "5% , mostly from dispersion at the opposite mirrored face but a small amount ( @xmath101% ) from minor in - plane cross talk , and negligible further out channeled light levels @xmath105% of central light .",
    "reducing the enclosing box thickness ( 6.35 mm acrylic box ( 1/4 \" ) surrounding the cells ) reduces the light dispersion shown here .",
    "this pattern is seen in all 3 projections , so that the cube containing the energy deposit is identified uniquely by amplitude alone .",
    "detected light may further be identified by signal timing , permitted location ( such as the gammas from positron annihilation must be on average in opposite directions ) , and sequencing on a per cell basis .",
    "this level of spatial and temporal segmentation , in addition to energy resolution , allows for elimination of background . ]",

    "0.3 in a sterile neutrino is a neutral lepton with no ordinary interactions ( except gravity ) other than those induced by mixing .",
    "they are present in most extensions of the standard model and in principle can have any mass .",
    "for example , sterile neutrinos are a natural ingredient of the most popular and appealing mechanism to generate neutrino masses , the type i seesaw mechanism  @xcite@xcite .",
    "they have also been shown to play an important role in leptogenesis  @xcite@xcite , and kev - scale sterile neutrinos could provide a warm dark matter candidate  @xcite .",
    "the focus of this review is a relatively light sterile neutrino that mixes significantly with ordinary neutrinos .",
    "there have been a number of recent experimental results that appear anomalous in the context of the standard 3-neutrino framework , but which can be explained by a sterile neutrino with a mass around 1ev ( summarized in a white paper@xcite that provides a comprehensive summary of this topic ) .",
    "the mentioned whitepaper@xcite , along with the recent report of the particle physics project prioritization panel ( p5 )  @xcite recommends construction of a short baseline neutrino oscillation experiment to clearly and unambiguously confront the hints of a 1ev sterile neutrino .",
    "inclusion of a new , sterile neutrino @xmath11 , requires minimal 3 + 1 neutrino mixing model in which the sterile neutrino is acting as a perturbation on the standard three flavor mixing . in this picture , the active neutrino flavors @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are predominantly composed of three light massive neutrinos @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 with masses @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20",
    ". the sterile neutrino would mostly be composed of a heavy neutrino @xmath21 with mass @xmath22 , so that @xmath23 , implying that @xmath24 which is of order 1ev@xmath2 .    in the 3 + 1",
    "neutrino mixing model , the survival probability in the very short baseline neutrino oscillation experiment is given by :    @xmath25 l[\\mathrm{m } ] } { e[\\mathrm{mev}]}\\ ] ]    where @xmath26 .",
    "there are pieces of experimental and observational evidence that either favor and disfavor a @xmath271ev sterile neutrino that mixes with the three active , light neutrinos .",
    "while a briefly review is presented here , a more complete review can be found in  @xcite .",
    "0.3 in the first , and individually still most significant , experimental evidence in favor of a light sterile neutrino is the result of the lsnd experiment at los alamos  @xcite , where electron antineutrinos were observed in a pure muon - antineutrino beam .",
    "the most straightforward interpretation of the lsnd result is antineutrino oscillation with mass squared difference @xmath28 . that value is incompatible with the mass squared differences implied by solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations , so a fourth neutrino is needed to account for this result .",
    "results on the invisible decay width of the z boson from the cern lep collider imply that a light fourth neutrino would have to be sterile ( i.e. it can not couple to z boson ) if it exists .",
    "support for the lsnd result comes from the miniboone experiment at fermilab which has reported a 2.8@xmath29 excess of events in the antineutrino mode  @xcite that is consistent with neutrino oscillations and the lsnd antineutrino appearance signal .",
    "miniboone also observes a 3.4@xmath30 excess of events in the neutrino mode data at low energy  @xcite . on the other hand , the karmen experiment @xcite saw no evidence of the disappearance of electron neutrinos , although probing a similar phase space as lsnd . other constraints disfavoring",
    "the sterile neutrino come from the non - observation of muon - neutrino disappearance by accelerator experiments like cdhsw @xcite and minos @xcite .",
    "finally , two more recent accelerator neutrino experiments opera @xcite and icarus @xcite reported negative results in a search for electron neutrinos in a muon - neutrino beam from cngs .",
    "however , these experiments did not test all regions of the relevant parameter space .      0.3 in for nearly three decades",
    "the expected nuclear reactor antineutrino flux has been calculated using a phenomenological model by conversion of the spectra from the thirty effective beta branches .",
    "the method relies on the measurement of the spectrum of fission induced electrons accompanying the antineutrino performed at ill  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "a new calculation of the reactor antineutrino flux was conducted in 2011  @xcite in preparation of the high precision @xmath31 search in the double chooz experiment .",
    "the new method relied on the detailed knowledge of the decays of thousands of fission products .",
    "inherent uncertainties in this model came from the various transitions that are not experimentally constrained .",
    "in addition to reducing the overall uncertainty of the expected antineutrino flux , the new calculation revealed a small overall increase in the expected flux at the level of 3.5% .",
    "when combined with small deficits in the detected antineutrino flux observed in near reactor experiments ( between 15 m and 1.5 km ) , the deficit between observed and expected reactor antineutrino rate increases to 5.7% with the mean value of : @xmath32    this amounts to a nearly 3@xmath29 effect and the effect was named the reactor antineutrino anomaly ( raa ) by g. mention _ et al . _",
    "@xcite .",
    "if the raa is due to neutrino mixing , it would require additional neutrino species with @xmath33 ev@xmath2 with the mixing amplitude @xmath34 .",
    "the existence of this new massive sterile neutrino would enable oscillations of electron antineutrinos into sterile neutrinos at distances less than @xmath35 m from the reactor core accompanied by the flat suppression of the electron antineutrino rate and spectrum observed at distances above 15 m indicated by the raa .",
    "the raa represents an independent hint of the existence of the new massive neutrino species potentially discernable at above 15 m baselines .      0.3 in calibrations with radioactive sources of @xmath36cr and @xmath37ar , which both decay via electron capture and",
    "emit mono - energetic electron neutrinos , were performed for the radio - chemical solar neutrino experiments based on gallium ( sage@xcite , and gallex@xcite ) . in both cases , a deficit of electron neutrinos of @xmath2725% was observed @xcite at distances of a few meters .",
    "this result can be explained by a @xmath271ev sterile neutrino , which would allow some of the electron neutrinos from the source to `` disappear '' before they can interact .",
    "the effect depends on nuclear matrix elements , but recent measurements of the relevant gamow - teller transitions strengths @xcite seem to support the gallium anomaly .",
    "0.3 in cosmological data , mainly from observations of the cosmic microwave background and large - scale structure , are sensitive to the possible existence of a light sterile neutrino .",
    "cosmology is sensitive to the effective number of neutrino families n@xmath38 primarily because energy density in relativistic particles affects directly the universe s expansion rate during the radiation dominated era .",
    "this results in sensitivity to light sterile neutrinos in cosmological observables such as the light elemental abundances from big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies , and the large - scale structure ( lss ) distribution . until very recently",
    ", a combination of these observables tended to favor a scenario with a fourth sterile neutrino .",
    "however , recent planck data @xcite seems to rule out the possibility of a fully thermalized light neutrino spectrum , finding @xmath39 at the 95% confidence level .",
    "wmap also published their limits based on the 7 years of data  @xcite and results vary depending on data sets included ( @xmath40 or @xmath40 + selected galaxy cluster abundances ( spt@xmath41 ) ) : @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "these results do not completely rule out the existence of a light sterile neutrino , because there are scenarios where sterile neutrinos would not have thermal energy spectra and number densities @xcite .    in summary",
    ", there are experimental results that appear anomalous ( at the @xmath44@xmath29 level ) in the context of the standard three - neutrino framework which can be explained by a sterile neutrino with a mass around 1ev . on the other hand , there are a number of results that are in conflict with this interpretation , also at the @xmath44@xmath29 level .",
    "it should also be noted that the experimental evidence in favor of a light sterile neutrino is from effects that are purely in count rates .",
    "to clearly resolve this situation , new experiments are needed , particularly ones at short baselines that can observe the energy spectrum distortion implied by a light sterile neutrino in addition to the overall rate deficit .",
    "the most promising venues are experiments close to nuclear reactor cores , with very strong radioactive sources ( @xmath45ce  @xmath45pr and @xmath36cr ) or at accelerators . the prospects of different experiments are discussed in detail in  @xcite .",
    "experiments very close to nuclear reactors and with intense radioactive sources are likely to be the first to provide data in favor / against the existence of sterile neutrinos .",
    "0.3 in nuclear reactors are copious electron antineutrino sources in the range below 10mev .",
    "a 1gw@xmath46 nuclear plant produces about @xmath47 @xmath48 from the beta decays of the reactor fission products originating mostly from @xmath49u , @xmath50u , @xmath51pu and @xmath52pu .",
    "the knowledge of reactor core composition and burn - up level allows calculation of the neutrino spectrum and rate as a function of time .",
    "since the spectrum and flux of reactor neutrinos are fairly well known , they are well suited for the study of the fundamental neutrino properties and neutrino oscillations in particular . in reactor neutrino experiments , the detected antineutrino rate and spectrum are compared with the expected spectrum and rate based on the reactor burn - up level . detected",
    "rate deficit and spectrum shape distortion indicate disappearance of electron antineutrinos , interpreted as antineutrino oscillations .",
    "reactor neutrino experiments with very short baseline ( @xmath53 m ) can test the @xmath271ev sterile neutrino hypothesis , as no other neutrino flavor oscillation can take place at such a short baseline .",
    "several such experiments are coming on line in the current and following years .",
    "the complete list ( to the best of our knowledge ) is given in the table  [ table : exp_list ] .",
    "0.3 in initial simulations of 2mev positrons show that both solid and liquid scintillators and different barrier choices have their advantages and disadvantages .",
    "solid detectors do not suffer from sprayed light and therefore have the most digital like signature . and",
    "while the overall amount of light reaching pmts is less , there is still enough light to detect 600kev positrons , below the ibd threshold .",
    "even with a very simple energy reconstruction , nulat can easily achieve 15% to 20% energy resolution at fwhm (                                                                                                                c.  grieb _ et al .",
