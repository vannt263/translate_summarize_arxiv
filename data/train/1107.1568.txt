    "the neutron spin echo technique ( nse ) @xcite in its different variants is a unique method for measuring dynamic processes in soft matter @xcite and spin excitations in magnetic systems @xcite . as it allows for the decoupling of the incoming wavelength distribution and the energy resolution , typically values in the nev to ev regime",

    "there exist different methods for neutron spin echo measurements , namely classical neutron spin echo ( nse ) @xcite and neutron resonance spin echo ( nrse ) @xcite .",
    "the application of nse and nrse is currently limited to measurements with dedicated instruments , where neither the samples nor the sample environment may depolarise the beam .",
    "a method similar to nrse is the mieze ( modulation of intensity by zero effort ) @xcite technique . as in mieze",
    "all spin manipulations are performed before the sample position it avoids the complications operating with polarised neutrons in strong magnetic fields or in a depolarising environment , like hydrogen containing samples , which introduce spin - flips .",
    "it can easily operate in any neutron scattering experiment with enough space before the sample and a detector with nanosecond time resolution .",
    "this method invented by ghler and golub @xcite has also been demonstrated experimentally in the nineties for soft matter samples @xcite .",
    "recently we published mieze measurements on the itinerant magnet mnsi in a magnetic field @xcite demonstrating the power of the method for magnetic applications .    mieze is easily implemented as an option at many instruments , provided a fast detector exists .",
    "it can add energy resolution down to the sub - ev region , mainly in the small angle regime .",
    "this paper aims to develop the tools necessary for designing a mieze option for a sans instrument adding high energy resolution to it .",
    "mieze uses the first arm of an nrse instrument , followed by a polarisation analyser in front of the sample and a fast neutron detector with ns time - resolution ( see figure [ fig : schema]b ) . in the following",
    "we use the wave packet description of the coarse monochromatised neutron beam . for",
    "a detailed quantum mechanical description see @xcite .",
    "while in nrse , all coils are operated at the same frequency @xcite , in mieze , the two coils are driven at different frequencies , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , with @xmath5 .",

    "the role of the polarisation in nse and nrse is now taken by the contrast @xmath22 of the time beating signal , which can be expressed as @xmath23 in analogy to nse , a signal measured at a specific spin - echo time @xmath24 is directly proportional to the intermediate scattering function @xmath25 . thus a typical mieze experiment results in the determination of @xmath26 over @xmath24 , where @xmath27 is the signal of an elastic reference sample , usually graphite or the sample in a frozen state ( like very low t in the case of magnetic systems ) .",

    "the flight paths of the neutrons are different , thus reducing the contrast of the intensity modulation . as an example , the instrument mira @xcite at the frm  ii will use a cascade detector @xcite with 2 m thick neutron detection planes .",

    "is demonstrated .",
    "the accessible parameter space in @xmath1 and @xmath24 can be enlarged when turning the sample by half the scattering angle , in the right direction .",
    "these theoretical predictions were tested for a cuboid of thickness @xmath69 mm and width @xmath70 mm using the mieze setup at frm ii @xcite and a very good agreement for various @xmath24 is obtained as shown in figure [ graphite ] .     the reduction factor @xmath51 versus @xmath1 for a cuboid of width @xmath70 mm and thickness @xmath69 mm compared to measured values of @xmath51 on the instrument mira with a wavelength @xmath63 of 10.4 .",

    "from the discussion above it becomes clear that the mieze technique is particularly well suited for measurements in the small angle regime as for low @xmath1 the contrast reduction due to the path length differences is less severe .",
    "therefore a combination of a time - of - flight sans instrument with a mieze option ( misans ) would allow for high resolution measurements both in energy- and q - space .",
    "the mieze principle at a time - of - flight source was recently demonstrated at the chopped cg-1d beam at hfir at the oak ridge national laboratory @xcite .    equations ( [ ver ] ) and ( [ time ] ) demonstrate that the different instrument design parameters are correlated . if @xmath73 is replaced by @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the distance between the last coil and the sample ( see figure [ fig : schema]b ) , one obtains @xmath76 this equation now allows for trading off different instrument designs if one defines the maximum range of spin - echo times .",
    "current nse measurements are performed up to 1s @xcite and are a benchmark for new spin echo beam lines . considering typical sans setups as proposed for long - pulse spallation sources such as the ess @xcite a zero - field region can be added to the 20 m long collimation section , with a coil distance , for example , @xmath77 m , a coil - sample distance @xmath78 m and a sample - detector distance @xmath79 m . for neutrons with @xmath80 , which is a typical wavelength used in nse for high resolution measurements , the remaining free parameter in eq .",

    "this can be obtained with current coil designs : rf coils that can be driven at these frequencies are in commissioning at the instruments reseda @xcite and trisp @xcite at frm  ii .    for these instrument parameters ,",

    "mieze times of 1s are achieved up to @xmath86@xmath2 for samples with a width of 5 mm and a thickness of 2 mm .",
    "the largest spin echo times are available for small @xmath1 , which matches the requirements of measuring quasi - elastic dynamics , i.e. very slow relaxation processes as they are expected for large scale structures , for example in soft matter and magnetic materials with novel topological structures .",
    "we do not discuss the @xmath1 resolution of such an instrument here , as it is mainly defined by @xmath87 , which is already small at a pulsed source , @xmath88 at the ess as discussed in @xcite , and by the beam divergence , which will also be excellent for such a long collimation section .    in conclusion , we propose to rather dramatically enhance the capabilities of a sans beam line at the ess with different options to obtain in parallel information on structure _ and _ dynamics , especially in magnetic fields .",
    "these options can be mieze , tisane @xcite and stroboscopic sans @xcite .",
    "the latter two are basically available free of charge with the fast time - resolving detector for mieze .",
    "they will cover the time domain from nanoseconds to minutes .",
    "such an instrument based on existing technology would open new perspectives for research in magnetic systems and soft matter .",
    "it would offer an excellent @xmath89-resolution and at the same time allow to measure the dynamics on a wide range of time scales , competitive to nse or nrse instruments .",
    "it would also be much cheaper and easier to build due to the reduced effort in magnetic shielding .",
    "furthermore it allows to use modern focusing neutron optics in any part of the instrument , enhancing the intensity at the sample .",
