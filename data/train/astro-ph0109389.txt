    "h  1821 + 643 is one of the most luminous quasars ( @xmath8 ) at low redshift ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "it was discovered as a serendipitous x - ray source detected with the _ einstein observatory _ @xcite and has been studied extensively ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it has been classified as a radio - quiet quasar according to its radio luminosity and nuclear [ ] luminosity @xcite .",
    "h  1821 + 643 is located in a cluster of galaxies with abell richness class @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "previous observations have shown an iron k@xmath11 emission line in the x - ray spectrum of h  1821 + 643 .",
    "_ ginga _ ( @xcite ) observed an iron line at @xmath12 kev ( rest frame of the quasar ) .",
    "the subsequent _ asca _ observation improved the measurement , and gave an observed line center energy of @xmath13 kev , or @xmath14 kev in the quasar rest frame @xcite , and a line width of @xmath15 ev .",
    "the authors attributed this to a broadened fluorescent iron line from a highly - ionized accretion disk .",
    "a particular problem with these observations is that although extened x - ray emission from the cluster that surrounds h  1821 + 643 has been detected with _",
    "rosat _ ( @xcite )",
    ", none of these observations has been able to obtain the spectrum of the cluster and therefore separate the contribution to the quasar iron line from the cluster . in a _ rosat _",
    "pspc observation @xcite concluded that the cluster could contribute @xmath16 to the observed fe emission line with _",
    "ginga_. @xcite placed an upper limit to the cluster contribution at @xmath17 by assuming a metal abundance of @xmath18 and a thermal temperature of @xmath19 kev .",
    "in this paper we present a high - resolution x - ray spectrum of h  1821 + 643 obtained with the _ chandra _ high energy transimission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ) .",
    "we clearly resolve an emission line from neutral or low - ionized iron . using the high spatial resolution of _ chandra _",
    "we have been able to resolve the extended emission from the surrounding cluster and for the first time obtain its x - ray spectrum .",
    "this enables us to determine the cluster contribution to the central quasar and make a more accurate line diagnostic .",
    "another motivation of this observation is to detect possible x - ray absorption features introduced by the warm / hot intergalactic medium in the local universe . at a moderate redshift",
    ", the sight line toward h  1821 + 643 traverses a distance of nearly @xmath20 gpc ( we use a hubble constant of @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) .",
    "numerous absorption systems ( such as h , c , n , o , si , etc . ) have been discovered in this sight line in optical and uv bands ( e.g. , @xcite ) . especially in recent observations , the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) and the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _",
    "( _ fuse _ ) have detected a number of absorption lines ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) which are not clearly associated with any galactic system .",
    "numerical simulations ( @xcite ) predict that at least some of this may be in the form of a moderately warm / hot ( @xmath23 k ) component of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) and the baryonic gas contained in the lines is about @xmath24 of this warm / hot igm ( whim ) .",
    "the remaining @xmath25 whim gas is in the form of hot gas which may be detected by and absorption lines in the x - ray band .",
    "h  1821 + 643 is one of the best candidates to observe for this purpose , given that it is one of the brightest x - ray quasars and has a relatvely simple spectral shape in the soft x - ray band .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows :  [ sec : da ] is data analysis ,  [ sec : con ] describes the continuum spectrum of h  1821 + 643 , ",
    "[ sec : emiss ] is devoted to emission line diagnostics , in ",
    "[ sec : abs ] we discuss the x - ray constraints on the absorbers , and study an absorption system at @xmath26 .",
    "we discuss the emission from the surrounding cluster in  [ sec : cluster ] .",
    "the last section is the summary .",
    "h  1821 + 643 was observed with the _ chandra _ high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ; @xcite ) on 2001 february 9 .",
    "the total exposure time was @xmath27 ksec .",
    "the hetgs produced a zeroth order image at the aim - point on the focal plane detector , the acis - s array , with higher order spectra dispersed to either side ( for acis - s , see @xcite ) .",
    "the telescope pointing direction was offset @xmath28 along @xmath29y in order to move the zeroth order off a detector node boundary . the science instrument module ( sim )",
    "was moved toward the read - out row by about @xmath30 to get better acis energy resolution ( for detailed instrument setups , see the _ chandra _ proposers observatory guide , or pog ) .",
    "figure  [ fig-1 ] displays the zeroth - order image in a @xmath31 region .",
    "we have smoothed the image for visual clarity .",
    "the zeroth - order count rate within a circle of @xmath32 radius is @xmath33 ( error is quoted at @xmath34 level ) and its light curve shows no significant variation during the observation .",
    "this count rate gives a pileup fraction of @xmath35 ( see pog ) and prevents us from analyzing the zeroth - order spectrum of the nucleus .",
    "we also label the position of the star k1 - 16 .",
    "the central star of the planetary nebula k1 - 16 was detected with the _ rosat _ pspc at about @xmath36 north and @xmath37 west of h  1821 + 643 @xcite .",
    "although this star would only significantly contribute to the ultrasoft emission between @xmath38 and @xmath39 kev , a roll angle of @xmath40 was applied to keep the spectra of the two sources from overlapping .",
    "spectral extractions and reductions were performed with the standard pipeline for the _ chandra _ hetgs provided by the chandra x - ray center ( cxc ) .",
    "we used a combination of _ chandra _ interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) v2.1 and custom routines in idl .",
    "the standard screening criteria were applied to the data .",
    "we selected photon events with _",
    "grades 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 and excluded those with energies above @xmath41 kev .",
    "the hetgs consists of two different grating assemblies , the high energy grating ( heg ) and the medium energy grating ( meg ) , and provides nearly constant spectral resolution ( @xmath42 for heg and @xmath43 for meg ) through the entire bandpass ( heg : 0.8 - 10 kev , meg : 0.4 - 8 kev ) .",
    "extraction windows of @xmath44 and @xmath45 widths in the cross - dispersion direction were applied for heg and meg , respectively .",
    "the moderate energy resolution of the acis - s is used to separate the overlapping orders of the dispersed spectrum .",
    "we added the plus and minus sides to obtain the first order spectra of both grating assemblies ( see figure  [ fig-2 ] ) .",
    "the effective area ( arf ) for this observation was obtained using the ciao tools .",
    "the spectrum in figure  [ fig-2 ] shows a smooth continuum with an emission feature at @xmath46 kev . in general , we find that a single power law with photoelectric absorption fits the entire bandpass of both meg and heg spectra very well .",
    "the meg and heg spectra were binned to a constant resolution of @xmath47 .",
    "we initially performed a simultaneous fit for heg ( 0.98 kev ) and meg ( 0.68 kev ) with a single power law plus photoelectric absorption at @xmath48 .",
    "we ignored the meg spectrum below 0.6 kev due to @xmath49 systematic uncertainties of spectral fluxes at the oxygen k edge region .",
    "the fitting parameters are shown in table  [ tbl-1 ] . in two fits , we fixed the absorption column density at the galactic value ( @xmath50 ; @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig-3 ] shows the best fit spectra and the ratio ( data divided by model ) .",
    "there is some weak evidence for excess emission below 1 kev .",
    "when we allow the absorption column density to vary , the best - fit column density @xmath51 is lower than @xmath52 at @xmath53 confidence level , so we infer that there is excess emission in the soft x - ray band .",
    "the free-@xmath51 model is a better fit to the data because the c - statistic drops significantly ( @xmath54 ) while the number of the degree of freedom drops imperceptibily .",
    "however , the soft excess might also result from residual calibration uncertainties in the meg effective area ( @xmath55 for @xmath56 kev ) .",
    "since the systematic uncertainties of the hetgs spectral fluxes are lower above 2 kev ( less than @xmath57 ) and an accurate measurement of the continuum level is important in identifying the emission feature , we fit instead the heg and meg spectra between 2 and 7 kev .",
    "figure  [ fig-2 ] shows that a single power law fits both meg and heg spectra very well in this band .",
    "since this energy band is largely insensitive to @xmath51 , we fix the column density at the galactic value . the best - fit photon index ( @xmath58 ) confidence level . ]",
    "is consistent with the previous result ( @xmath59 ) reported by _ asca",
    "_ @xcite at better than the @xmath34 level .",
    "it is also consistent with indices of other radio - quiet quasars @xcite . the flux ( 210 kev , observer frame ) and luminosity ( 210 kev , quasar frame ) are @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "these values are also consistent with those reported from _ asca _",
    "@xcite , _ exosat _",
    "@xcite , _ ginga _ ( @xcite ) and _ bbxrt _ @xcite .",
    "_ asca _ observation reported a flux of @xmath62 and a luminosity of @xmath63 in the corresponding energy bands .",
    "figure  [ fig-3 ] shows that the emission feature at @xmath64 5 kev can be well fitted with the gaussian parameters detailed in table  [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "we also fit the heg and meg spectra separately to check for consistency , and we list the results from fitting the heg data only in table  [ tbl-2 ] . given that the respective heg and meg resolutions are @xmath65 ev and 80 ev fwhm ( full width at half - maximum ) at the observed line energy ( pog ) , the line is clearly resolved by both grating assemblies .",
    "table  [ tbl-2 ] shows that the gaussian fit significantly improves the c - statistic by @xmath66 , indicating a detection significance of nearly @xmath67 for three degrees of freedom ( namely , gaussian line flux , line width and the center energy ) . to investigate whether or not the line is the neutral k@xmath11 line",
    ", we also fit the spectra by fixing the line center energy at 6.4 kev .",
    "the c - statistic is higher by 1.28 with one less degree of freedom , which means a neutral iron k@xmath11 line can be ruled out at @xmath68 level but not at @xmath53 level .",
    "figure  [ fig-4 ] shows the best fit and @xmath68 , @xmath53 and @xmath69 joint confidence regions for the line center energy and the line flux .",
    "the iron k@xmath11 line feature in h  1821 + 643 was measured with _ ginga _",
    "observations @xcite at @xmath12 kev ( rest frame of the quasar ) and with _ asca _ at @xmath14 kev @xcite .",
    "_ chandra _ observations give a rest - frame line energy of @xmath70 kev ( @xmath71 kev at @xmath4 level ) .",
    "this shows that the line energy from the _ asca _ observation was excluded at @xmath53 confidence but is within @xmath4 of the _ chandra _ observation .",
    "even after the addition of this iron k@xmath11 line , there are still residuals present at energies @xmath72 kev ( quasar frame ) in both heg and meg spectra .",
    "we add a second gaussian line component , with the energy and the line width as free parameters .",
    "the spectral fit results for this second component are also listed in table  [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "the c - statistic decreases by @xmath73 , which corresponds to a detection significance of @xmath74 . fitting with the heg data only fails to constrain the line width ; however , the simultaneous spectral fit of heg and meg gives a line width of @xmath75 ev .",
    "we have used the extracted cluster profile and spectrum to estimate the amount of flux that the cluster could have contributed to both emission lines in the grating spectra ( see  [ sec : cluster ] ) .",
    "we conclude that the hot cluster should have no contribution to the neutral iron line at @xmath76 kev ( rest frame ) . using the profile derived in  [ sec : cluster ] we find that the cluster can contribute at most @xmath77 flux to the 6.9 kev line .",
    "the observed line energy of @xmath64 @xmath78 kev implies that the fluorescent iron line is from neutral and/or low ionization states of iron , although the @xmath53 confidence errors can not rule out contribution from ionization states up to ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the line center energy is consistent with the energy of k@xmath79 ( 6.434 kev ) or k@xmath80 ( 6.435 kev ) ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) ; however , we can not rule out k@xmath11 emission from an outflow with a velocity of @xmath81 .",
    "such a fluorescent iron line implies the existence of cold ( @xmath82 k ) reprocessing material ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) illuminated by x - ray continuum .",
    "an incident x - ray photon is either compton scattered by electrons in the cold gas , or photoelectrically absorbed followed by fluorescent line emission or auger de - excitation .",
    "this photoelectric absorption would produce iron k edges at relatively higher energies .",
    "iron k edges were not detected in the heg and meg spectra of h  1821 + 643 . in order to estimate the significance of the iron k edge",
    ", we include a multiplicative edge model to the power law plus the gaussian model .",
    "the edge energy is fixed at 7.1 kev ( quasar frame ) because the k edges of most neutral and low ionization states of iron ( up to ) are around this energy @xcite .",
    "the @xmath53 upper limit to the optical depth of the edge is @xmath83 , which corresponds to a @xmath53 upper limit of the hydrogen equivalent column density at @xmath84 .",
    "here we assume solar abundance @xcite and use the photoionization cross sections from @xcite .",
    "several models have been proposed to explain the origin of the reprocessing material responsible for the fe line .",
    "three possible scenarios are that the iron line is reflected ( 1 ) from material in the disk close to the black hole which is subject to relativistic and transverse doppler effects ( diskline model , @xcite ) , ( 2 ) from a molecular torus @xcite , ( 3 ) or from the broad line region ( blr ) clouds @xcite .",
    "we find that the diskline model gives an acceptable fit to the iron emission line .",
    "however , we can not rule out the torus model if the reflection material has a small thomson optical depth .",
    "a blr origin for the fe line requires a strong flux variation on timescales of @xmath64 months .",
    "here we discuss each model .",
    "* diskline model : * the diskline model provides acceptable fits to both heg and meg data .",
    "thus far , this has been the most commonly used model for explaining the broad fe k@xmath11 line observed in many seyfert 1 galaxies @xcite and quasars @xcite . in this model , x - rays are reprocessed in a cold or highly ionized accretion disk rotating around a schwarzschild black hole with a characteristic radius of @xmath85 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , where @xmath86 is the mass of the central black hole . the intrinsically narrow line ( line width @xmath87 ev ) is broadened by the relativistic motion of the disk ranging from a few hundred ev to @xmath64 kev ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "we fix the inner and outer disk radii at @xmath88 and @xmath89 respectively , where @xmath88 is the last stable orbit radius of a schwarzschild black hole with mass @xmath86 .",
    "the radial power law index of the emissivity is fixed at @xmath90 .",
    "three parameters , the line centroid energy , the line intensity and the disk inclination angle ( @xmath91 ) , are allowed to vary .",
    "the spectral fit results are shown in table  [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "the c - statistic of the diskline model is comparable to that of a simple gaussian fit , implying both models are acceptable .",
    "the line centroid energy is @xmath92 kev , comparable to within the @xmath53 confidence error of the best - fit gaussian value reported earlier .",
    "the diskline model predicts a skewed , double - horned line profile in which the blueward side drops sharply .",
    "our _ chandra _ observation is not able to detect this level of structure .",
    "iron k emission line seen with _ asca _ shows an ew of @xmath93 ev at 6.58 kev @xcite .",
    "one of their explanations for the line strength and position is that the line is reprocessed from an accretion disk in which iron is ionized up to the he - like states ( @xmath94 kev ) in the innermost part , and redshifted to the observed 6.58 kev energy by the strong gravitation of the central black hole .",
    "we suspect that the _ asca _ data was unable to distinguish between the 6.4 and 6.9 kev lines , given its resolution ( the _ asca _ resolution at the fe k energies is @xmath15 ev fwhm , respectively 4 and 2 times worse when compared with the heg and meg ) .",
    "the _ chandra _",
    "data clearly show an emission line from neutral or low ionization states .",
    "* torus : * recent _ chandra _ hetgs and _ xmm - newton _ observations have shown that narrow iron k emission at @xmath76 kev is prevalent in many active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and quasars ( e.g. , @xcite for mkn 205 , @xcite for mkn 509 and @xcite for ngc 5548 ) .",
    "a common phenomenon is that these agns and quasars showed a broader fe k emission in their _ asca _ spectra . for mkn 205 and",
    "mkn 509 the narrow component is attributed to reflection from the putative torus based on the @xmath95 ev measured ews . according to @xcite",
    ", the the characteristic ew of an iron k@xmath11 line from the torus could be @xmath1 ev if the reflection material has a typical thomson optical depth @xmath96 .",
    "the ew in h  1821 + 643 is @xmath97 ev .",
    "* blr clouds : * the line width of the 6.4 kev line in h  1821 + 643 is @xmath98 ev , which corresponds to @xmath99 fwhm .",
    "@xcite observed a narrower line ( @xmath100 fwhm ) in ngc 5548 with the _ chandra _ hetg .",
    "they attributed the broadening of the fe k@xmath11 line to the bulk velocity of the emitting gas , which may be located in the broad line region . based on their model",
    ", we calculate the line intensity and ew of the 6.4 kev line in h  1821 + 643 , using the upper limit of the hydrogen column density from the iron k - edge constraint .",
    "we obtain the @xmath53 upper limit of the line intensity and ew of @xmath101 and @xmath102 ev , respectively .",
    "both values fall short of the observed values by a significant factor of @xmath46 .",
    "@xcite encountered the same problem and they attributed this to the possible variation of the continuum level shortly before the _ chandra _ observation . for h  1821 + 643 , on a central black hole mass of @xmath103 @xcite , the blr regions which emit the iron k line should be located at a distance of @xmath104 light days from the central x - ray source . in order to reconcile the observed ew with that expected from the blr , the x - ray flux of h  1821 + 643 would have to have varied by a factor of @xmath46 in a timescale of @xmath105 months .",
    "_ asca _ and _ chandra _ observations showed that h  1821 + 643 experienced only a @xmath106 flux variation in a timescale of a few years .",
    "so we consider a fivefold variation to be unlikely and conclude that the emission from blr is not the main source of the observed iron k line .",
    "there are several possibilities for the origin of the emission line detected at 6.9  kev .",
    "these include environments ( e.g. narrow line regions , or hot accretion disk ) which are hot enough , or have high enough ionization to produce h - like fe . however , it is of interest to consider a scenario which can accommodate both the fe  k@xmath11 and lines seen in the chandra hetgs spectrum for this source , since this could provide us with the unique prospect for probing in detail the condition and structure of the accretion disk in h  1821 + 643 .",
    "irradiation by x - rays can photoionize the surface layers of the accretion disk ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the iron line(s ) produced by the illuminated matter and the associated reflection spectrum depend largely on the ionization parameter @xmath107 ( e.g. @xcite , for the case of a constant density structure accretion disk ) .",
    "there are also other dependences , e.g. the spectral index of the incident x - rays ( the maximum gas temperature is indirectly related to @xmath108 ) , and the strength of the illumination ( characterized by the gravity parameter @xmath109 , respectively for high and low illumination , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 ) .",
    "recent calculations of ionized reflection spectra which include hydrostatic equilibrium effects have been presented by @xcite and @xcite .    in the context of these models ,",
    "one may envisage the accretion disk of h  1821 + 643 to be comprised of a highly ionized optically thin atmosphere sitting atop a mostly neutral disk .",
    "the thomson depth of the upper compton heated layer should be such ( e.g. @xmath112 ) that most of the x - rays propagating through the disk can reach the bottom colder layers to produce the observed cold reflection spectrum , while also showing ionized features .",
    "( @xcite and @xcite report narrow transitions from hot to cold material in the illuminated layers . )",
    "it is curious that a he - like fe line at @xmath113  kev is not seen .",
    "however , it is possible that the upper layer has an ionization state to support only h - like fe .",
    "h  1821 + 643 is one of the brightest x - ray quasars at low redshift , therefore it provides a unique opportunity to probe the so - called `` missing baryons '' along this particular line - of - sight ( see @xcite and @xcite for discussion about the missing baryons problem ) .",
    "the path length to h1821 + 643 is almost @xmath114 gpc .",
    "the low galactic hydrogen column density ( @xmath115 ) and relatively simple spectral shape reduce the spectral complexity typically seen in seyfert galaxies and other active galaxy nuclei , making it easy to identify any intervening absorption .",
    "furthermore , recent observations with _ hst _ and _ fuse _ indicate that there are at least six intervening absorption systems ( @xcite ; see table  [ tbl-3 ] ) .",
    "highly ionized ions , such as , are important ion species in diagnosing the physical conditions of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "the production of ions requires photons or electrons with energy @xmath116 ev , so can be produced by photoionization from the background radiation , or collision ionization in a hot gas with temperatures above @xmath117 k. however , current observations of absorption lines can not definitively constrain the ionization mechanism @xcite .",
    "x - ray absorption lines from he - like or h - like ions , such as ( 0.574 kev ) and ( 0.654 kev ) can give direct evidence of a hot , collisionally ionized gas with temperature ranging from @xmath118 k to @xmath119 k.    identifying absorption features requires a careful measurement of the continuum . to achieve this , we take the meg data ( heg does not have enough effective area below 0.8 kev ) and initially fit the 0.44 kev spectrum with a power law and the galactic absorption .",
    "we then fit the residual with a five - order polynomial to obtain an accurate characterization of the continuum .",
    "the five - order polynomial will account for spectral features larger than @xmath120 ( such as calibration uncertainties ) but will preserve narrow line features .",
    "the data are binned at @xmath47 and we calculated the @xmath121 ( the signal - to - noise ratio ) of each bin .",
    "figure  [ fig-5 ] shows the @xmath122 spectrum .",
    "the bottom panel of each plot gives @xmath121 , and the two dotted lines within the @xmath121 plot correspond to @xmath123 level .",
    "an absorption line feature should at least have a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath124 level to be identified .",
    "figure  [ fig-5 ] shows that each bin in 1628@xmath125 has @xmath126 , which indicates that no absorption line is identified in this observation .",
    "interestingly , we find an emission feature at around @xmath127 with @xmath128 .",
    "there is no known emission feature in this wavelength in the rest frame of the quasar . assuming a poisson distribution for each bin , the probability for observing one bin with @xmath129 in one observation of h  1821 + 643 is @xmath130 .",
    "so the line may be the result of a statistical fluctuation .",

    "three metallicity models are considered here : two with a constant metallicity ( @xmath160 and @xmath161 , where @xmath162 is the solar abundance ) and one in which metallicity is a function of baryon density . in the last model ,",
    "we adopt the numerical simulation data from @xcite .",
    "the cloudy calculation stops when the neutral hydrogen column density reaches @xmath163 @xcite . to obtain the , and column densities under different physical conditions we adjust the ionization parameter @xmath164 , where @xmath165 is the density of ionizing photons and @xmath166 is the hydrogen number density .",
    "we find that none of the three models can give detectable and column densities in the x - ray band .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig-7 ] .",
    "the top , middle and bottom panels stand for models with @xmath160 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 ( @xmath169 is the baryon density , see @xcite ) , respectively . for each model",
    "we calculate the , and column densities .",
    "the observed column density is shown as the horizontal dashed line in each panel and the vertical dashed line in each panel indicates the corresponding ionization parameters ( or hydrogen number density ) .",

    "none of these and column densities can be detected with current and planned x - ray telescopes ( for x - ray telescope detection limits , see @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , in the @xmath160 model , the expected and column densities are only @xmath170 and @xmath171 , respectively .",
    "given such a low density system at @xmath26 , only when its metallicity reaches solar abundance could absorption line be detected with current x - ray instruments ( when @xmath172 ; see figure  [ fig-7 ] ) .",
    "recent hydrodynamic simulations showed that the typical metallicity of the gas that produces absorption lines is @xmath173 @xcite .",

    "optical spectroscopy of six member galaxies showed that the redshift of the cluster , @xmath174 , is consistent with the redshift of the quasar @xcite .",
    "they also determined the velocity dispersion of the cluster to be @xmath175 which indicates that this cluster is quite massive .",
    "this is consistent with the cluster richness , r@xmath1762 , determined by @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig-1 ] shows the zeroth order image , and from the contours it appears that there is extended emission around h  1821 + 643 . to quantify this",
    "we first corrected the image for the known detector irregularities and for telescope vignetting .",
    "we then extracted a profile in radial bins with each bin being @xmath177 wide . the profile from 2@xmath178 to 160@xmath178",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig-8 ] along with the model fits .",
    "the initial model was a combination of the chandra point spread function ( psf ) and a @xmath139-model @xcite for the extended emission from the cluster .",
    "this proved to be a rather poor fit to the x - ray profile , leaving excess emission between 5 and 15@xmath178 .",
    "we then added a gaussian component to account for this extra emission and found an acceptable fit to the profile .",
    "formally , the reduced @xmath179 is 2.51 ( 343.6/137 dof ) but the largest contribution is from the quasar where a modest amount of instrumental pileup is not well modeled by the chandra psf .",
    "evaluating the model between 5@xmath178 and 160@xmath178 results in @xmath180 = 1.71 .",
    "the parameters for the cluster profile are similar to those found for other clusters , a core radius of @xmath181 ( 0.1 mpc ) and a @xmath182 .",
    "the additional gaussian component has a @xmath183 value of @xmath184 . at the distance of the cluster this corresponds to 37.3 kpc , which is similar to the scale for a giant elliptical galaxy .",
    "the acis - s3 spectral data for the cluster was extracted from @xmath185 to @xmath186 and this is what we refer to as the global spectrum ( figure  [ fig-9 ] ) . by excluding a 3@xmath178 radius circle around the quasar we have eliminated essentially all the flux from a point source from our analysis ( the _ chandra _ proposers observatory guide , figure 6.3 ) .",
    "we used the xspec mekal model with galactic absoption to fit the cluster spectrum and the fit parameters are given in table  [ tbl-4 ] .",
    "in addition to the temperature and abundance we also allowed the redshift to be a free parameter in fitting the global spectrum . from the x - ray data we find that the redshift of the hot gas is 0.303 with a lower limit of 0.299 and an upper limit of 0.309 ( @xmath53 confidence limits ) consistent with the redshift of the quasar and that of the optical galaxies .",
    "we also had sufficient counts to extract the spectrum in radial rings and the parameters for these fits are listed in table  [ tbl-4 ] .",
    "we find the overall temperature and metal abundance ( @xmath187 kev and @xmath188 ) are consistent with those of a typical hot cluster .",
    "the luminosity between 2 and 10 kev ( quasar frame ) is @xmath189 , which is roughly consistent with temperature - luminosity relationship obtained with _",
    "asca _ @xcite .",
    "we also find that the temperature is cooler in inner regions between 3 and @xmath190 ; however , the cooler temperature is not consistent with that of a typical elliptical galaxy @xcite .",
    "we estimate that the cluster makes negligible contribution to the iron 6.9 kev emission line detected in the grating spectrum .",
    "the strongest emission line from a hot cluster plasma in that line region is k@xmath11 line . from the 3 to @xmath191 region",
    ", we obtain the k@xmath11 line flux is @xmath192 .",
    "we also estimate that for the part of the cluster hidden by the quasar the fraction of the cluster flux should be at most @xmath193 from the surface brightness profile ( figure  [ fig-8 ] ) . by comparing the line flux from the grating spectra in table  [ tbl-2 ] , we find that the cluster can contribute at most @xmath194 to the 6.9 kev line flux .",

    "chandra _ hetgs .",
    "our main conclusions can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "an emission feature at @xmath64 5 kev was detected at nearly @xmath67 level and has been identified as a fluorescent iron line .",
    "the rest - frame line - center energy ( @xmath70 kev ) implies this line is from neutral or low ionization states of iron , although we can not rule out contribution from ionization states up to .",
    "an emission feature at around 6.9 kev ( rest frame of the quasar ) was marginally detected at @xmath74 level and is identified as a possible h - like fe emission line .",
    "the diskline model provides an acceptable fit to the 6.4 kev iron line ; however , a putative torus could also make contributions to the ew of the emission line .",
    "the model in which x - rays are reflected from the blr clouds requires the x - ray flux from h  1821 + 643 to vary at a significant level ( a factor of at least 5 ) on a timescale of @xmath105 months , which seems unlikely . in order to accommodate both the fe  k@xmath11 and lines",
    ", we suggest that both lines could originate in an accretion disk comprised of a highly ionized optically thin atmosphere sitting atop a mostly neutral disk .",
    "no absorption features were detected at or above the @xmath4 level .",
    "a total of six intervening absorption systems have been detected with _",
    "hst _ and _ fuse_. we place @xmath4 upper limits on and column densities at the corresponding redshifts , which have typical values of @xmath195 .",
    "we focus on the @xmath26 absorption system and constrain its physical conditions by combining uv and x - ray observations . assuming collisional ionization , we constrain the gas temperature at @xmath5 k , which is consistent the results from hydrodynamic simulations . however ,",
    "if the absorbers are photo - ionized by the background radiation , no detectable or lines are expected .",
    "we obtain the surface brightness profile and spectra of the cluster that surrounds h  1821 + 643 .",
    "the x - ray spectra reveal that this is a typical hot cluster with a temperature of @xmath196 kev and a metal abundance of @xmath7 .",
    "we also obtain the redshift of the cluster , which is consistent with results from optical measurements .",
    "we estimate that the cluster makes negligible contributions to the 6.9 kev iron k line flux .",
