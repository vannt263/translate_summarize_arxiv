    "relatively high superfluid @xmath0 of @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) compared with @xmath0 of @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) kindles the view that high - temperature superconductivity might derive from preformed real - space charged bosons rather than in the bcs state with the strongly overlapping cooper pairs . indeed ,",
    "there is increasing experimental evidence that cuprates are bosonic superconductors @xcite .",
    "a possible fundamental origin of such strong departure of the cuprates from conventional bcs behaviour is the unscreened ( frhlich ) epi of the order of 1 ev @xcite , routinely neglected in the hubbard @xmath5 and @xmath6 models of cuprate superconductors @xcite .",
    "this interaction with @xmath7axis polarized optical phonons is virtually unscreened because the upper limit for the out - of - plane plasmon frequency ( @xmath8 @xmath9 @xcite ) in cuprates is well below the characteristic frequency of optical phonons , @xmath10 400 - 1000 cm @xmath11 .",
    "since screening is poor , the magnetic interaction remains small compared with the frhlich epi at any doping of cuprates . in order to generate a convincing theory of high - temperature superconductivity , one has to treat the long - range coulomb repulsion and the _ unscreened _ epi on an equal footing .",
    "when both interactions are strong compared with the kinetic energy of carriers , this coulomb - frhlich model ( cfm ) predicts the ground state in the form of mobile small bipolarons , which bose - condense at high temperatures @xcite .",
    "most compelling evidence for ( bi)polaronic carries in cuprate superconductors is provided by the discovery of a substantial isotope effect on the carrier mass @xcite predicted for the ( bi)polaronic conductors in ref .",
    "high resolution arpes @xcite provides another piece of evidence for a strong epi in cuprates @xcite apparently with c - axis - polarised optical phonons @xcite .",
    "these as well as earlier optical @xcite , neutron scattering @xcite and more recent tunnelling @xcite experiments unambiguously show that the lattice vibrations play a significant though unconventional role in high temperature superconductors .",
    "operating together with a shorter range deformation potential and molecular - type ( e.g. jahn - teller @xcite ) epis , the frhlich epi readily overcomes the coulomb repulsion at a short distance about the lattice constant providing a non - retarded attraction to form small yet mobile bipolarons @xcite .",
    "when strong epi binds holes into intersite oxygen bipolarons @xcite , the chemical potential remains pinned inside the charge transfer gap , as clearly observed in the tunnelling experiments by bozovic et al . in optimally doped la@xmath12sr@xmath13cuo@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the bipolaron binding energy and the singlet - triplet bipolaron exchange energy are thought to be the origin of normal state charge and spin pseudogaps , respectively , as has been predicted by us @xcite and later supported experimentally @xcite . in overdoped samples carriers screen part of epi with low frequency phonons .",
    "hence , the bipolaron binding energy decreases @xcite and the hole bandwidth increases with doping . as a result",
    ", the chemical potential enters the oxygen band in overdoped samples , so that a fermi - level crossing could be seen in arppes at overdoping where mobile bipolarons coexist with the polaronic fermi - liquid @xcite .    here",
    "i briefly review a number of theoretical and experimental observations supporting the bosonic model of superconducting cuprates at variance with bcs - like and phase - fluctuation scenarios .",
    "a parameter - free estimate of the fermi energy @xcite clearly supports the real - space ( i.e individual ) pairing in cuprate superconductors .",
    "the band structure of cuprates is quasi - two - dimensional . applying the parabolic approximation for the band dispersion one",
    "readily estimates the fermi energy in 2d as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the distance between copper - oxygen planes , @xmath17 is the in - plane magnetic - field penetration depth at low temperatures , and @xmath18 are the density of hole polarons and their effective mass , respectively .",
    "here one assumes that the ` superfluid ' density at zero temperature is about the same as the normal state density of holes , as it must be in any clean superfluid @xcite .",
    "the low - temperature penetration depth is unusually large , @xmath19 nm , in cuprates , so that the renormalised fermi energy turns out to be surprisingly low , @xmath20 mev , rendering the migdal - eliashberg theory @xcite inadequate . in fact , @xmath21 is so small that the individual pairing is very likely .",
    "such pairing will occur when the size of the pair , @xmath22 is small compared with the inter - pair separation , @xmath23 , so that the condition for real - space pairing is @xmath24 . experimentally measured pseudogaps of many cuprates are about @xmath25 mev or larger .",
    "if one accepts that the pseudogap is about half of the pair binding energy , @xmath26 , @xcite then the condition for real - space pairing is well satisfied in most cuprates ( typically @xmath27 nm ) .",
    "when bipolarons are small so that pairs do not overlap , the pairs can form a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) @xcite .",
    "recent quantum monte carlo simulations of cfm show that with realistic values of epi coupling constant , @xmath28 , and high optical phonon frequencies one can avoid overlap of pairs and get a very high bose - condensation temperature @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "actually @xmath29 fits the experimental @xmath0 in a great number of cuprates without any fitting parameters @xcite .",
    "in contrast with ref .",
    "@xcite our expression for @xmath29 involves not only the in - plane , @xmath30 , but also the out - of - plane , @xmath31 , magnetic field penetration depth , and the normal state hall ratio @xmath32 just above the transition , @xmath33 here @xmath34 is measured in kelvin , @xmath35 in @xmath36 and @xmath37 in cm . since all quantities in eq.([tc",
    "] ) are measurable , the bipolaron theory provides the parameter - free expression , which unambiguously tells us how near cuprates are to the bec regime .",
    "its comparison with the experimental @xmath34 of more than @xmath38 different cuprates , where both @xmath30 and @xmath31 have been measured along with @xmath39 , show that @xmath29 fits experimental values within an experimental error bar for the penetration depths .",
    "one can argue that due to a large anisotropy cuprates may belong to the 2d ` @xmath40 ' universality class with the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) superfluid critical temperature @xmath41 of the cooper pairs @xcite .",
    "the kt transition temperature is expressed through the in - plane penetration depth alone as @xmath42 .",
    "it turns out significantly higher than the experimental values in many cuprates .",
    "there are also quite a few samples with about the same @xmath43 and about the same inter - plane distance @xmath16 , but with very different values of @xmath44 which makes the kt scenario unviable . on the contrary , our parameter - free fit of the experimental critical temperature and the critical behavior ( see below ) favor @xmath45 bec of charged bosons as the mechanism of high t@xmath46 rather than any low - dimensional phase - fluctuation scenario .",
    "the state of bipolarons above the resistive @xmath34 is perfectly `` normal '' in the sense that the off - diagonal order parameter ( i.e. the bogoliubov - gorkov anomalous average @xmath47 ) is zero ( here @xmath48 annihilates electrons with spin @xmath49 at the point @xmath50 ) .    on",
    "the contrary @xmath51 remains nonzero in the phase fluctuation scenario @xcite with vortexes in the normal state above @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "we have noticed that the phase fluctuation scenario is not compatible with extremely sharp resistive transitions at @xmath0 in high - quality underdoped , optimally and overdoped cuprates , and with the insulating - like in - plane resistivity of underdoped cuprates in high magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "for example ,",
    "the in - plane and out - of - plane resistivity of @xmath52 , where the anomalous nernst signal has been measured @xcite , is perfectly `` normal '' above @xmath0 , showing only a few percent positive or negative magnetoresistance @xcite , explained with bipolarons @xcite .",
    "both in - plane and out - of - plane resistive transitions of high - quality samples remain sharp in the magnetic field providing a reliable determination of the genuine upper critical field , @xmath53 .",
    "many high magnetic field studies revealed a non - bcs upward curvature of @xmath53 ( for review see @xcite ) with a non - linear temperature dependence in the vicinity of @xmath54 in many cuprates and some other unconventional superconductors , fig.[hc2 ] .",
    "if unconventional superconductors are in the ` bosonic ' limit , such unusual critical fields are expected in accordance with the theoretical prediction for bec of charged bosons in the external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "-0.5 mm    also the bipolaron theory accounts for the anomalous nernst signal , and the insulating - like in - plane resistivity of underdoped cuprates @xcite as observed @xcite .",
    "the transverse nernst - ettingshausen effect ( here the nernst effect ) is the appearance of a transverse electric field @xmath55 perpendicular to the magnetic filed and to a temperature gradient , @xmath56 .",
    "when bipolarons are formed the chemical potential is negative in the normal state .",
    "it is found in the impurity band just below the mobility edge at @xmath57 .",
    "carriers , localised below the mobility edge contribute to the longitudinal transport together with the itinerant carriers in extended states above the mobility edge .",
    "importantly the contribution of localised carriers adds to the contribution of itinerant carriers to produce a large nernst signal , @xmath58 , while it reduces the thermopower @xmath59 and the hall angle @xmath60 .",
    "this unusual `` symmetry breaking '' is at variance with conventional metals where the familiar `` sondheimer '' cancelation @xcite makes @xmath61 much smaller than @xmath62 because of the electron - hole symmetry near the fermi level .",
    "such behaviour originates in the `` sign '' ( or `` @xmath63 '' ) anomaly of the hall conductivity of localised carriers .",
    "the sign of their hall effect is often @xmath64 to that of the thermopower as observed in many amorphous semiconductors @xcite .",

    "this unusual effect can be broadly understood as the bose - einstein condensate tunnelling into a cuprate _",

    ". then the coherence length is @xmath153 from eq.([psi ] ) .",
    "if the normal barrier , at @xmath154 , is an underdoped cuprate semiconductor above its transition temperature , the chemical potential @xmath88 lies below the quasi-2d bosonic band by some energy @xmath155 given by @xmath156 which is exponentially small at @xmath157 turning into zero at @xmath158 . here",
    "@xmath159 , is the transition temperature of the barrier , and @xmath160 .",
    "the gp equation in the barrier is written as @xmath161 . in a wide temperature range",
    "@xmath162 , this length turns out much larger than the zero - temperature coherence length , @xmath102 , since @xmath163 in eq.([eps ] ) could be very small , which explains gpa .",
    "the physical reason why the quasi-2d bosons display a large normal - state coherence length , whereas 3d bose - systems ( or any - d fermi - systems ) at the same values of parameters do not , originates in the large density of states ( dos ) near the band edge of two - dimensional bosons compared with 3d dos .",
    "since dos is large , the chemical potential is pinned near the edge with the exponentially small magnitude , @xmath164 , at @xmath165 .",
    "importantly if the barrier is undoped ( @xmath166 ) @xmath163 becomes large , @xmath167 , for any finite temperature @xmath168 . in this case",
    "the current should exponentially decay with the characteristic length smaller that @xmath102 , as is also experimentally observed @xcite .",
    "a first proposal for high temperature superconductivity , made by ogg jr in 1946 @xcite , already involved real - space pairing of individual electrons into bosonic molecules with zero total spin .",
    "this idea was further developed as a natural explanation of conventional superconductivity by schafroth @xcite and butler and blatt @xcite .",
    "the ogg - schafroth picture was practically forgotten because it neither accounted quantitatively for the critical behavior of conventional superconductors , nor did it explain the microscopic nature of attractive forces which could overcome the coulomb repulsion between two electrons constituting a pair . on the contrary highly successful for low-@xmath0 metals and alloys the bcs theory , where two electrons were indeed correlated , but at a very large distance of about @xmath169 times of the average inter - electron spacing , led many researchers to believe that cuprate superconductors should also be `` bcs - like '' ( maybe with strong phase fluctuations ) .",
    "however , by extending the bcs theory towards the strong epi , a charged bose liquid of small bipolarons was predicted by us @xcite with a further prediction that high @xmath0 should exist in the crossover region of the epi strength from the bcs - like to bipolaronic superconductivity @xcite .",
    "later on we have shown that the unscreened frhlich epi combined with the strong coulomb repulsion provides superlight small bipolarons , which are several orders lighter than the holstein bipolarons @xcite .",
    "the bipolaron theory predicted such key features of cuprate superconductors as anomalous upper critical fields @xcite , spin and charge pseudogaps @xcite , and anomalous isotope effects @xcite later observed experimentally ( for review see @xcite ) .",
    "the strong epi has been experimentally established in cuprates beyond any reasonable doubt .",
    "we believe that the following conditions are responsible for the high - temperature superconductivity in cuprates @xcite : ( a ) the parent compounds are ionic insulators with light oxygen ions to form high - frequency optical phonons , ( b ) the structure is quasi two - dimensional to ensure poor screening of epi with c - axis polarized phonons , ( c ) there is strong on - site coulomb repulsion to form intersite mobile bipolarons rather than strongly localised on - site pairs , ( d ) there are moderate carrier densities to keep the system of small bipolarons close to the dilute regime .    here",
    "i have shown that the normal - state diamagnetism , the nernst , thermal hall and giant proximity effects provide further evidence for a genuine bose - einstein condensation of real - space lattice bipolarons in cuprates .",
