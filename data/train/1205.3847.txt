    "the correspondence between strongly coupled gauge theories and quantum gravity  @xcite-@xcite suggests that gravitation and spacetime may be viewed as emergent structures  emergent from within the intricate non - linear interactions of non - gravitational quantum field theories .",
    "one aspect of this correspondence that remains particularly challenging to understand has to do with a thermodynamics theme that seems to underly gravitational dynamics  @xcite .",
    "a representative illustration of this problem arises in the following process .",
    "a stringy  possibly planckian  probe falls into a black hole .",
    "the expectation from the gravity - gauge theory correspondence is that the probe gets thermalized as it flies through the spacetime region near the horizon of the black hole  @xcite .",
    "what underlies this mechanism of thermalization on the gravity side ?",
    "more precisely , what is the spacetime that the probe actually sees as it crosses the horizon  if not the smooth , traditional , no - hair region that ends with a pathological singularity .",
    "furthermore , there have been suggestions that this thermalization process is an unusual one , characterized by a fast scrambling of the information in the probe  @xcite .",
    "the situation also ties in with the black hole information paradox that attempts to account for such scrambled information  @xcite . in a slightly different language , we want to find out why does the traditional picture of the spacetime near a black hole horizon fail to fully capture horizon physics  even when the curvature scales at the horizon are very small .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate these questions using the strongly coupled @xmath0 dimensional gauge theory that describes d0 brane dynamics  @xcite .",
    "we want to quantify the thermalization process on the gauge theory side using numerical simulations ; and identify the role played by background fields that the d0 branes are immersed in .",
    "if a spacetime  be it that of a traditional black hole or one of the many fuzzball geometries  @xcite  is to thermalize a probe , in what way does this spacetime fix the thermodynamic attributes of this thermalization process ?",
    "for example , if a probe is to get scrambled into a configuration of temperature determined by the size of a black hole horizon , we want to find out how the geometrical information about the size of the horizon gets eventually encoded into the temperature attribute of the scrambled probe . through this",
    ", we can start addressing the difficult question as to how one determines the emergent spacetime that an in - falling probe actually experiences  assuming the traditional no - hair geometry somehow falters in the vicinity of a horizon .",
    "the numerical simulation of @xmath0 dimensional @xmath1 super yang - mills theory at strong coupling is a difficult one  even without the inclusion of supersymmetry  since it is particularly computationally intensive  @xcite .",
    "larger values of @xmath2 provide for numerical stability at the expense of time .",
    "and a thermodynamic treatment requires a large ensemble of simulations .",
    "we overcome these problems by a series of efficient physical and technical tricks that we develop ; and through the use of recent technological advances in parallel processing .",
    "the result is a framework of d0 brane dynamics exploration that can be done in real - time , pocking and tweaking the parameters as the dynamics evolves so as to develop physical intuition about this very rich system .",
    "we track the time evolution of a probe consisting of @xmath2 d0 branes in various background field configurations  in their center of mass frame .",
    "the d0 brane coordinates are represented by @xmath3 hermitian traceless matrices @xmath4 , nine in total , one for every spatial direction .",
    "the eigenvalues of these matrices may be interpreted as the positions of the individual d0 branes .",
    "we define _ the extent _ of the probe in a subspace of the nine space directions as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is one representative index within the subspace of interest ( no sum over @xmath6 ) .",
    "the actual size of the probe is defined as  @xcite @xmath7 for @xmath6 summed over @xmath8 .",
    "in all cases , we start the d0 branes in a static two - sphere configuration in three of the nine space directions @xmath9 = i \\varepsilon^{ijk } \\sigma^k\\ \\ \\ \\mbox{for $ i , j , k=1,2,3$}\\ ] ] where the @xmath10 s are the pauli matrices in an @xmath3 representation , and where @xmath11 is a tunable parameter that fixes the initial size .",
    "this initial size is then given by @xmath12 for @xmath13 .",
    "tuning @xmath11 also corresponds to adjusting the initial energy of the setup : smaller @xmath11 corresponds to smaller initial energy .",
    "we refer to the six directions transverse to the initial spherical configuration as the transverse directions ; and we refer to the remaining three as probe directions .",
    "matrices in the three probe directions are denoted by @xmath14 with @xmath15 ; while those in the transverse directions are denoted by @xmath16 with @xmath17 , initially set to zero .",
    "the momenta matrices in the probe directions are denoted by @xmath18 , while those in the transverse directions are labeled @xmath19 .",
    "we also add small random gaussian fluctuations to the initial positions of the d0 branes  off the spherical shape of the probe .",
    "this is so as to avoid starting on top of a saddle point in the potential , ending up exploring non - generic regions of the phase space .",
    "this initial randomization of the positions can be viewed as accounting for the effect of initial quantum or thermal fluctuations  @xcite .    in this work",

    "the spherical configuration oscillates to a smaller extent in the probe directions ; at the same time , its initial zero extent in the transverse directions expands to form a uniform fuzzy ball in all nine space directions . in a short time  within a few oscillations ",
    "the eigenvalue spectrum becomes thermal .",
    "the effective yang - mills coupling is mostly large  _",
    "i.e. _ the thermalization phenomenon is a strong coupling effect .",
    "there are various interesting attributes of this process that we discover as we vary the background parameters .",
    "we explore three qualitatively different scenarios .",
    "first , we consider zero but thermally fluctuating background fields .",
    "this corresponds to exploring the effects of a dilute gas of massless supergravity fields onto the probe . in this analysis",
    ", we include the effects of thermal back - reaction  a central but delicate mechanism to the process of thermalization in traditional thermodynamic systems .",
    "we consider only a fluctuating background metric and d2 brane flux for simplicity .",
    "next , we consider non - zero background fields with negligible fluctuations and study the effects of non - zero gravity and d2 brane flux on d0 probe thermalization . finally , we model the problem of the probe falling into a large schwarzschild black hole and determine the effect of the in - fall on the thermalization of the probe .",
    "we summarize the results in the upcoming three sections .",
    "we start with zero background fields  with or without thermal fluctuations of the supergravity fields . even when the background fluctuations are zero , we introduce a level of randomization into the problem by perturbing the initial spherical configuration of the d0 branes at around @xmath28 level .",
    "we can vary @xmath2 , the number of d0 branes in the probe , and the initial size of the probe sphere  through the parameter @xmath11 which also tunes the initial energy .",
    "figure  [ fig : effectofs ] shows the data we collect from a simulation for @xmath29 and @xmath30 d0 branes . in this case , we have no background field fluctuations .",
    "these six plots are generated for every simulation , and we use this example to outline the typical analysis we perform for any simulation . the top three plots in the figure     for the time to thermalize , @xmath31 for lifetime , @xmath32 for probe temperature , and @xmath33 for final probe size .",
    "for this simulation , the input parameters were : @xmath30 , @xmath29 , with no background fluctuations .",

    "the two leftmost graphs on the bottom are histograms of the eigenvalues of momenta matrices , computed for the last half of the simulation timeline where the probe has settled into a potentially thermal configuration .",
    "a semicircle pattern is indicative of thermalization , with the radius of the semicircle giving us a measure of the probe s temperature @xmath32 )  @xcite .",
    "the rightmost plot on the bottom is a graph of the autocorrelation function @xmath37 as a function of time @xmath22 ; and the @xmath38 operator is given by @xmath39 .",
    "this measures the autocorrelation of a gauge invariant operator over time : for a thermalizing state , the function should decay exponential over time .",
    "we see from the example depicted in the figure that the probe does indeed thermalize . from these graphs ,",
    "we extract the timescale of thermalization @xmath40 and the probe temperature @xmath41 as shown .",
    "eventually , our simulation invariably breaks down .",
    "we track this by looking at the constraint equation @xmath42 + \\left [ y^a , q_a \\right ] = 0\\ ] ] which needs to be satisfied for a consistent dynamical system .",
    "this break - down is seen to occur often ( but not always ) because the size of the probe suddenly explodes .",
    "it signals the accumulation of significant numerical errors by the evolution algorithm . for zero background fields",
    ", there is a flat direction in the system when all nine matrices become mutually commuting .",
    "then the configuration can expand unbounded with no cost of energy ",
    "the larger in size the better from entropic considerations .",
    "it is likely that the numerical errors that we see in the simulations are due to this instability some of the time .",
    "we associate a lifetime with the probe , denoted by @xmath31 , the time it takes for the probe to de - stabilize and fly apart , measured from the start of the simulation as shown in the figure . we are uncertain whether this quantity @xmath31 is a physical one , or a pathology of numerical simulations . finally , from a blow - up of the size plot",
    ", we can read off the equilibrium size of the probe @xmath43 .",
    "hence , each simulation gives us four outputs : @xmath40 , @xmath31 , @xmath41 , and @xmath43 .",

    "we have scanned over several orders of magnitude of background temperatures @xmath44 within the regime of validity of our formalism , and considered the delicate effect of thermal back - reaction  with no change in the conclusion .",
    ", @xmath30 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "we see that background fluctuations do not effect the thermal properties of the probe , except for its lifetime .",
    "the size of the fluctuations is determined by the temperature @xmath44 , as well as the string coupling @xmath49 , as described in detail in the main text.,width=672 ]    putting all these results together , we find the following scaling relation for the equilibrium size @xmath43 @xmath50 for the thermalization time , we find @xmath51 and for the temperature of the probe @xmath41 , we find @xmath52 as for the lifetime of the probe , we find @xmath53 irrespective of the details , the d0 brane probe seems to eventually disintegrate in a time @xmath31 .",
    "the thermalization time @xmath40 is of particular interest given the proposal of  @xcite suggesting that black holes are highly efficient scramblers  with their scrambling timescale proportional to the logarithm of the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "we will comment on the implications of our results with regards to this proposal in the conclusion section at the end .",
    "if the probe is too small and the background gas temperature @xmath44 is too large , the probe s thermalization is disrupted and the evolution follows deterministic oscillations .",
    "we can not determine whether this is a physical effect or a numerical pathology since these simulations lie at the edge of the regime of validity of our formalism .",
    "we also consider ` on - shell background fluctuations ' : that is , background field fluctuations that satisfy the laplace equation at the center of mass of the probe .",
    "this corresponds to a scenario where there is no matter sourcing the background fields at the probe s location .",
    "once again , thermalization is disrupted and we are unable to determine whether the effect is physical or numerical . either way , these scenarios are uninteresting since they do not lead to thermalization .",
    "all four of these relations  ( [ eq : relation1 ] ) to  ( [ eq : relation4 ] ) are insensitive to the temperature of the background @xmath44 !",
    "a thermal bath of massless supergravity fields seems to play no role in the thermalization of the probe .",
    "the conclusive theme of the analysis can be summarized as follows : the thermalization of a probe of d0 branes is an internal process arising from the non - linear d0 brane interactions and strong yang - mills coupling .",
    "a quartic term in the d0 brane matrix coordinates in the hamiltonian of the system underlies this thermalization phenomenon .",
    "the result depends on the number of d0 branes and their equilibrium size .",
    "fluctuations in the background fields do not play a relevant role in this process , a fact that is rather counter - intuitive as compared to more traditional statistical mechanical systems .",
    "there is however a role played by the fluctuating fields in destabilizing the configuration at high enough temperatures .",
    "this regime is however at the edge of the regime of validity of our analysis .",
    "the size of the probe may be sensitive to large non - zero background fields , as opposed to small fluctuating ones .",
    "we will investigate this case next .",
    "we next consider non - zero background fields with negligible thermal fluctuations .",
    "we turn on the effect of the background metric through tidal gravitational forces acting on the probe in its center of mass frame ; and we also turn on background d2 brane flux .",
    "these fields may be arising from a large number of background d - branes that our probe is inserted into .",
    "if the background is to represent a black hole , we may expect d2 brane flux from previous investigations of matrix black holes  @xcite .",

    "this is akin to the gravitational gregory - laflamme phenomenon , and syncs well with the gravitational analogue of this scenario presented in  @xcite . at this point",
    ", we get a ringing behavior as shown in figure  [ fig : ringing ] .",

    "larger d2 flux results in larger thermal equilibrium size of the probe , which correlates with the proximity of a larger background black hole .",
    "larger d2 brane flux seems to also hasten the thermalization .",

    "finally , in the lower right graph , we plot the @xmath72 parameter , defined later on in the main text : this parameter tracks the adiabatic regime of validity of the fermi normal coordinates . if @xmath73 , the simulation results can not be trusted .",
    "as we can see , the parameter remains well within the reliable range as the probe crosses the horizon , but not much beyond.,width=576 ]    we find that the probe thermalizes due to internal dynamics as seen earlier , when it is away from the horizon .",
    "we find surprisingly that this thermalization is insensitive to the black hole temperature ! the thermalization time and the equilibrium probe temperature and size do not depend on the black hole parameters .",
    "as the probe approaches the horizon , we do however see the probe explode in size .",
    "our formalism however breaks down before the probe can reach the size of the horizon .",
    "the trend however is consistent with a probe expanding violently in size as it nears the horizon , as proposed in  @xcite .",

    "the shorter timescale comes from the fluctuations in the thermal bath .",

    "this delicate mechanism is at the heart of thermalization in numerous physical systems and underlies for example brownian motion dynamics . to illustrate it concretely , and",

    "our system then oscillates harmonically with average spring constant @xmath147 .",
    "this treatment would miss the interesting effect of thermalization that , depending on the circumstances , may affect the dynamics significantly .",
    "instead , we need to keep track of the effect of the evolution of the system on the heat bath which then back reacts on the system .",
    "the fluctuations @xmath150 occur over the short timescale @xmath153 and have a prescribed distribution determined by the nature of the thermal ensemble .",

    "the time dependence of @xmath282 is given by @xmath283 where @xmath62 is the initial radial position of the center of mass , and @xmath226 is related to the local fermi time @xmath22 via @xmath284 or @xmath285 we assume the in - fall starts with zero velocity .",
    "we then identify the background field parameters of our dbi action as @xmath286 where we have divided the three dimensional subspace into two subspaces as defined in  ( [ eq : bhsubspace ] ) .",
    "the temperature of the black hole is given by @xmath287 with @xmath63 being the location of the black hole horizon .",
    "in dimensionless variables , we then have @xmath288 where @xmath44 is the black hole temperature @xmath151 in units of @xmath24 . to find @xmath282 as a function of time @xmath22",

    "the time to reach the horizon is then @xmath299    as input parameter , we get to specify the string coupling @xmath49 , the initial size of the probe ( through @xmath11 ) , @xmath296 , the back hole mass or equivalently horizon @xmath63 , and the initial position of the probe @xmath62 . for the analysis to be reliable",
    ", we need to satisfy the following conditions .",
    "we need small string coupling  ( [ eq : smallcouplingcond ] ) @xmath300 and weak background fields  ( [ eq : weakfieldscond ] ) @xmath301 g_s^{2/3}\\ll 1\\ .\\ ] ] this condition needs to be satisfied at all times .",
    "this means that , given a choice of valid @xmath296 , the simulation is still to break down as the probe approaches the black hole singularity .",
    "hence , we need to keep track of this condition as a function of time to know when to stop the simulation .",
    "a proper dbi approximation requires  ( [ eq : dbicond ] ) @xmath302 g_s^{2/3 } \\ll 1\\ .\\ ] ] this latter condition is now trickier to handle : in cases i and ii , the probe invariably collapsed to smaller sizes ; hence , assuring that @xmath11 is small enough at time zero was enough . in this case",
    ", we may see @xmath11 grow in size as a function of time , as the probe approaches the black hole .",
    "hence , we need to check that this condition is satisfied throughout time . finally , these fermi normal coordinates are reliable in the adiabatic regime .",
    "this requires the condition  @xcite @xmath303 @xmath304 is the size of the probe as defined in  ( [ eq : sizedef ] ) .",
    "once the probe becomes large enough to violate this condition , we need to stop the simulation .",
    "our strategy goes as follows .",
    "having experimented with the previous two cases , we know that we need a time of flight of the order of @xmath305 with @xmath306 to maintain control over the numerics of the simulations at the level of @xmath21 error .",
    "this fixes @xmath307 .",
    "hence , choosing any @xmath26 is enough to handle the first two conditions  ( [ eq : bhcond1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : bhcond2 ] ) .",
    "the third condition  ( [ eq : bhcond3 ] ) is inconsequential since we can always adjust @xmath49 to be smaller ( which makes the planck length smaller ) for given @xmath11 .",
    "the fourth condition  ( [ eq : bhcond4 ] ) is however one we need to keep a close eye on .",
    "it says that as the probe approaches the horizon , we need to make sure that the probe size @xmath304 is much less than the horizon size .",
    "this may be a problem , since one school of thought is that the probe may spread to the size of the black hole as it crosses the horizon ... if this is the case , the adiabatic approximation of the fermi coordinates breaks down and we may need to revise the setup .",
    "the simulations were implemented as a first order coupled hamiltonian system using a fourth - order runge - kutta algorithm with a typical time increment of @xmath306  except when the thermal fluctuation timescale is smaller @xmath308 , where we reduce the size of the time - step accordingly @xmath309 .",

    "we checked for both energy conservation and the constraint violation .",
    "this happens invariably as numerical errors accumulate over time , or when the probe starts exploding in size introducing large numbers in the simulation code that are more susceptible to computational errors .",
    "the simulation code was first implemented in mathematica ; and then , for efficiency purposes , recoded independently in objective - c .",
    "the two independent codes running on several different platforms , from linux to mac , were tested against each other and verified to yield the same results .",
    "then the computation - intensive work was delegated to the objective - c version with the addition of thermal fluctuations .",
    "single - precision floating numbers were used using the blas and lapack open source linear algebra libraries that take advantage of parallel - processing with multicore cpus .",
    "a typical simulation for @xmath30 takes about five minutes to complete on @xmath313 cores . at larger values of @xmath2 , we ran into memory limitations and hence an associated disk - writing time penalty . eventually , the code will be ported to gpu systems and is expected to run up to @xmath314 times faster .",
    "for now , we restricted our simulations to @xmath315 .",
    "with the fluctuations added , the constraint  ( [ eq : simconstraint ] ) is satisfied at the initial time .",
    "the system s evolution then assures that the constraint remains satisfied .",
    "we use the violation of the constraint to track numerical error and stop the simulation when the errors reach the @xmath21 level .",
    "the results shown in this work involved over @xmath20 simulations with varied parameters .",
    "mathematica was used to analyze the results and generate the plots .",
    "all code is available upon request .",
    "we also have developed a visual interface front - end to the code that allows realtime exploration of d0 brane dynamics .",
    "we have found that d0 brane probes have an internal mechanism , at strong coupling , for thermalizing and scrambling their initial conditions .",
    "the quartic term in the hamiltonian is at the heart of this process .",
    "this was already determined for the bmn case in  @xcite .",
    "our results extend this conclusion to a large class of backgrounds .",
    "this process of thermalization is a quick one : the configuration reaches an equilibrium size and temperature after a few natural oscillations .",
    "the final temperature and size , as well as the time scale of thermalization , are independent of thermal background field fluctuations  a surprising outcome given that in most traditional statistical mechanical systems this process is intimately tied with the dynamics of the background thermal bath .",
    "furthermore , background metric geometry on its own is not obviously correlated with this thermalization mechanism if the probe size is much smaller that the curvature length scale of the background ; but some background rr fluxes do play a critical role .",
    "these observations suggest that , if a black hole geometry is to imprint its attributes onto the thermalization process of an in - falling probe , it can do so in one of two ways : ( 1 ) have hair , perhaps along the line of the fuzzball proposal  @xcite . in our language",
    ", this corresponds to the effect of d2 brane flux on the thermal attributes of the probe ; or ( 2 ) by expanding the in - falling probe to the order of the size of the horizon , a phenomenon we see a signature of in this work on the gauge theory side , and in previous work  @xcite on the gravity side .",
    "it is most likely that both mechanisms are concurrently at work in higher dimensions .",
    "looking more specifically at the many scaling relations we extracted from the simulations , we found that the equilibrium size of the thermalized d0 brane probe scales linearly with the number of d0 branes @xmath2 : the more d0 branes , the bigger the equilibrium configuration , suggesting an incompressibility bound that these planckian building blocks seem to be saturating .",
    "furthermore , the larger this equilibrium size , the quicker the thermalization . and the equilibrium temperature of the probe increases with its equilibrium size , suggesting that perhaps we are not seeing the probe collapsing into an individual black hole  which would have an inverse relation between its temperature and its size . instead , the probe may be merging with a large background black hole .",
    "we see a correlation between the size of the probe and background d2 flux akin to the dielectric effect of  @xcite , but now in this more general dynamical scenario .",
    "the matrix black hole picture of  @xcite has reinforced the idea that the black hole must have some order or structure , perhaps in the form of a fuzzy d - brane stretched at the horizon .",
    "while the effect of the d2 flux on the thermal properties of the probe such as its temperature is in tune with such a picture , we fail to see a signature of this order emerging within the d0 brane probe itself .",
    "perhaps this requires a delicate phase transition within the probe  @xcite which can be captured when more background fluxes are turn on ; in particular , d0 brane flux , which we did not consider , would give a magnetic velocity dependent force that may play a crucial role .",
    "intuitively , we can summarize the thermalization phenomenon we observe throughout our simulations as follows . at strong coupling ,",
    "the d0 brane probe collapses in size but maintains a coherent , dense , seemingly incompressible configuration of finite smaller size . and",
    "when the system is maintained in such a confined space long enough  a few natural oscillations of the probe  the non - linear quartic term in the hamiltonian scrambles the information in the probe into a thermal distribution .",
    "the process is characterized by internal attributes of the probe , or external attributes of the background that effect the equilibrium size of the probe .",
    "this latter mechanism can arise from either background fluxes , or from the probe becoming large enough to experience the ir cutoff set by the background metric curvature .    through the works of  @xcite",
    ", it was proposed that black holes are the fastest scramblers in the universe .",
    "the associated scrambling time @xmath40 is conjectured to scale as @xmath316 where we have written the expression in terms of our notation ( @xmath41 being the probe temperature ) .",
    "this is to be contrasted with normal matter scramblers associated with a time scale @xmath317 where @xmath184 is a dimension dependent number .",
    "we will now argue that our results are indeed consistent with the conjectures of  @xcite . to see this , we start from  ( [ eq : scramblingtime ] ) and  ( [ eq : scramblingtemperature ] ) and get @xmath318 @xmath11 tunes the energy of the system , and hence is related to the dimensionless coupling defined in  ( [ eq : geff ] ) .",
    "given we are probing a large @xmath2 regime , we expect that the effective coupling would instead scale as @xmath319 instead of @xmath320 .",
    "@xmath72 is the energy of the probe , and , at equilibrium , scales as @xmath321 as argued in  ( [ eq : energyestimate])-([eq : energyestimate2 ] ) .",
    "@xmath123 is close to @xmath142 for a structure that is truly random .",
    "however , if there is @xmath125 order at equilibrium  that is a membrane like structure to the d0 branes  it would be close to @xmath143 as seen earlier for the perfectly spherical initial configuration .",
    "looking back at  ( [ eq : relation1 ] ) , we see that , at equilibrium , we have @xmath322 which indeed implies that the equilibrium configuration is closer to one forming d2 branes , with @xmath323 . putting things together with @xmath124 , we can express @xmath11 in terms of @xmath324 in  ( [ eq : thermal2 ] ) @xmath325 with no @xmath2 dependence left !",
    "the stronger the effective coupling , the shorter the thermalization or scrambling time , which makes sense .",
    "and we do not have a power law dependence on the degrees of freedom @xmath2 .",
    "the conjecture of  @xcite suggests a @xmath326 dependence .",
    "we believe that to capture this leading behavior in @xmath2 , we need a full quantum treatment of the problem . that all powers of @xmath2 cancel in this expression at the classical level is consistent with the conjecture .",
    "this also syncs well with our observation that d2 brane background flux affects the size of the configuration : if the background fields are to arise from other matrix black hole d0 branes interacting with the probe , a d2 brane order in the background matrix black hole would be seeding this flux that is needed to correlate thermalization properties of the probe with those of the background black hole .    for all of our simulations , a numerical instability developed after enough time had elapsed .",
    "it can not be determined conclusively and with certainty whether this phenomenon is a real physical one or a pathology of the numerical evolution of the hamiltonian system . for zero background fields ,",
    "the system does have a flat direction that drives the system to larger entropically favored configurations  which in turn increases numerical instability .",
    "however , we see this numerical instability even when there is no flat direction in the system . while we determined scaling relations for the lifetime of the probe",
    ", we do not hence know whether to accord any physical significance to these .",
    "our technique did eventually run against computational limitations and the truly large @xmath2 behavior of the dynamics could not be extensively developed .",
    "fortunately , this can easily be remedied given that our simulation code is parallelized and can be adopted relatively easily onto high performance gpu architecture .",
    "this would take us from @xmath327 cores to around @xmath328 cores ; that is a factor of @xmath314 decrease in computation time .",
    "we plan to implement these technical improvements in the near future .",
    "another direction for further exploration involves determining the effects of quantum back - reaction from the background fields onto d0 brane dynamics .",
    "it has been suggested in the fuzzball proposal context that the many fuzzball geometries are in a quantum superposition  @xcite ; hence a probe would be sensitive to quantum fluctuations of the background geometry instead of the thermal ones investigated in this work .",
    "this topic may be accessible analytically using adiabacity techniques developed in the context of the study of berry phases .",
    "we hope to report on this in the near future .",
