    "experiments which study deep inelastic @xmath2 scattering ( dis ) have given decisive information about the basic structure of matter .",
    "results from the linear accelerator at slac @xcite gave the first evidence for a pointlike substructure in the proton .",
    "at the higher energies available at the hera collider at desy it has been possible to penetrate still deeper into the proton .",
    "dis has the advantage over @xmath3-annihilation and hadronic collisions , that there are two different scales , the total hadronic energy @xmath4 and the photon virtuality @xmath1 , which can be varied independently .",
    "this offers a unique possibility to study the interplay between the perturbative and non - perturbative regimes in strong interaction .",
    "a remarkable result at hera is the observation that for a fixed limited value of @xmath1 , the @xmath5 cross section grows very rapidly for large @xmath4 or small @xmath6 , approximately proportional to @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "such a strong increase , which is significantly stronger than the corresponding growth of the @xmath9 cross section at similar energies , was predicted by the bfkl @xcite evolution formalism , based on the exchange of perturbative gluon chains .",
    "indeed , in leading logarithmic order the bfkl equation predicts an even stronger increase than what is experimentally observed .",
    "the significance of the bfkl result is somewhat reduced by the facts that first the next to leading order correction is very large , secondly the introduction of a running coupling would favour chains close to the non - perturbative region , which makes the result sensitive to a necessary soft cutoff .",
    "both of these effects make the perturbative expansion less reliable .",
    "although the experimental results do indicate that some hard perturbative mechanism is at work , it has also been possible to fit the data without the bfkl mechanism , provided the soft nonperturbative input gluon distribution grows sufficiently rapidly for small @xmath10 .",
    "measurements of the total cross section , described by the structure function @xmath11 , can not separate between the different mechanisms .",
    "further experimental studies of the properties of the final states are needed , in parallel with theoretical work to distinguish between different possibilities .",
    "the derivation of the bfkl equation , and also of the ccfm equation @xcite which interpolates between the finite-@xmath1-bfkl and the large-@xmath1 regimes , are technically quite complicated",
    ". a semiclassical description , which can give an intuitive picture of the results , may therefore be valuable and possibly helpful in the work towards a better understanding of dis , and of the strong interaction in general .",
    "an attempt for such a picture will be presented in the sections 2 - 5 below .    the linked dipole chain model ( ldc ) @xcite is a reformulation and generalization of the ccfm model .",
    "the formalism in the ldc model has great similarities with the description in the semiclassical model presented here , and thus it offers a quantitative motivation for the qualitative results in our intuitive picture .",
    "a very brief description of the ldc model is presented in section 6 , including also a discussion of possible applications to hadronic collisions .    in this article",
