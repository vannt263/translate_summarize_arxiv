    "the production of scalar mesons in radiative decays is a valuable source of information on hadron spectroscopy .",
    "it was argued @xcite that the branching ratio for @xmath5 can be used to make a unique choice among different models of @xmath2 : a conventional quark - antiquark state , an exotic @xmath6 state @xcite , and a @xmath1 molecule @xcite . such a possibility to resolve the long debated problem of the @xmath2 structure using a single partial width looks very attractive .",
    "however , it was argued in @xcite that the dependence of the theoretical predictions for the @xmath5 decay on the @xmath2 structure is partly due to differences in modeling .",
    "recent measurements of the radiative decays @xmath7 by snd @xcite and @xmath8 by cmd-2 @xcite in novosibirsk have made it possible to confront alternative models of the light scalar mesons with experimental data .",
    "the goal of this paper is to reanalyze the calculation of the decay width for @xmath5 in coupled channel models where the @xmath2 state arises as a dynamical state ( a @xmath1 molecule which may also have a substantial admixture of a quark - antiquark component ) .",
    "since the @xmath9 meson is nearly a pure @xmath10 state , the decay @xmath11 is an ozi  rule violating process which is expected to proceed via a two  step mechanism with intermediate @xmath1 states . therefore this decay is well suited for probing the @xmath1 content of the scalar mesons .",
    "the @xmath1 molecular state was originally proposed in the potential quark model @xcite . a dynamical state close to @xmath1 threshold",
    "is also introduced in the coupled channel models @xcite and in the meson exchange interaction models @xcite .",
    "a state strongly coupled to the @xmath10 and @xmath1 channels near the @xmath1 threshold was as well found in the unitarized quark model @xcite . the coupled - channel model derived from the lowest order chiral lagrangian @xcite produces a scalar state dominated by the @xmath1 channel .",
    "general discussions of the nature of the @xmath2 can be found in @xcite and references therein .",
    "our approach is based on a coupled channel model ( ccm ) for the @xmath12 and @xmath1 systems which is similar to the one studied in @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the decay @xmath13 for point - like particles is summarized in sec .",
    "the details of the coupled channel model are given in sec .",

    "the details of the formalism are collected in the appendices .",
    "for the benefit of the reader , we begin with a brief summary of the formulas describing radiative transitions between vector and scalar states . the amplitude of the radiative @xmath9 decay into the scalar meson @xmath15 has the following structure which is imposed by gauge invariance : @xmath16 where ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) and ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) are the polarizations and four - momenta of the @xmath9 and @xmath21 , correspondingly , and @xmath22 is the scalar invariant amplitude which depends on the invariant masses of the initial and final mesons .",
    "the polarization vectors satisfy the constraints @xmath23 and @xmath24 . using the three - dimensional gauge @xmath25 in the center - of - mass system ( cms )",
    "one gets the amplitude @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the @xmath9 mass , @xmath28 is the photon energy in the cms , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the @xmath9 and @xmath21 three  dimensional polarization vectors in the cms , respectively .",
    "+    for point - like particles , the amplitude @xmath31 is given by the diagrams in fig.[figmphigs ] ( see @xcite and references therein ) . while the diagram fig.[figmphigs](a ) corresponding to loop radiation is overall logarithmically divergent , its contribution to the @xmath32 term in eq.([mphigs ] ) is finite .",
    "gauge invariance enforces the appearance of the seagull diagram fig.[figmphigs](b ) which contributes only to the @xmath33 term in eq.([mphigs ] ) . since the sum of the loop ",
    "radiation and seagull terms is gauge invariant , one obtains the total amplitude @xmath34 by calculating only the @xmath32 term of the loop radiation .",
    "the result for the scalar invariant amplitude is @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the @xmath38 and @xmath39 coupling constants and the function @xmath40 is defined in [ appiab ] .",
    "the radiative decay width is @xmath41    the generalization of eqs .",
    "( [ mphigs],[hphigs],[gphigs ] ) to the case @xmath0 where the @xmath12 system has total angular momentum @xmath42 and isospin @xmath43 is straightforward @xcite : @xmath44 here the scalar invariant amplitude @xmath45 is given by ( compare with eq.([hphigs ] ) ) @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the @xmath42 part of the @xmath48-matrix for the @xmath49 scattering .",
    "the @xmath12 invariant mass distribution has the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the isoscalar @xmath52 amplitude and @xmath53 is the relative momentum of the pions in the final state : @xmath54    equation ( [ dgphigpipi ] ) leads to eq.([gphigs ] ) in the breit  wigner ( bw ) approximation for the @xmath49 scattering amplitude @xmath55 under the assumption that the integral over the @xmath12 mass spectrum is saturated by the narrow resonance with mass @xmath56 and width @xmath57 ( see [ appiab ] ) .    according to eq.([hphigpipi ] ) , the hadronic part of the amplitude , which contains the information about the scalar mesons , is factored out in the form of the @xmath48-matrix for the @xmath49 scattering , with both the physical region ( @xmath58 ) and the unphysical region ( @xmath59 ) being relevant to the @xmath0 decay .",
    "it is known from the studies of scalar mesons , see @xcite and references therein , that the analytical structure of the scalar  isoscalar amplitudes near the @xmath1 threshold is far from being a trivial bw resonance",
    ". therefore a coupled channel model of the @xmath49 scattering is required to describe the decay @xmath0 beyond the bw approximation .",
    "to describe the interaction in the @xmath60 system with total angular momentum @xmath61 and isospin @xmath62 we exploit a coupled channel model similar to that of @xcite .",
    "the two scattering channels , 1 and 2 , correspond to the @xmath12 and @xmath1 systems and channel 3 contains a single @xmath4 bound state .",
    "the @xmath48-matrix , as a function of the invariant mass squared @xmath63 , is defined by the lippmann - schwinger equation @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the free green function .",
    "the interaction potentials are taken in separable form : @xmath66 where the form factors in channel 1 and 2 depend on the corresponding relative three  momentum @xmath67 : @xmath68 in @xcite , the potentials @xmath69 were assumed to be energy independent , and the chiral symmetry constraints on the scattering amplitude were strictly imposed only in the @xmath12 channel by adjusting the strength of @xmath70 so that the adler zero is at the correct position . in the present case , it is essential to ensure a correct behaviour of the @xmath71 scattering amplitude not only in the physical scattering region but also down to the @xmath12 threshold .",
    "we found it easier to impose the chiral symmetry constraints by using energy dependent potentials .",
    "the energy dependence is taken in the form @xmath72 with our choice of interaction ( [ vsep]-[v22 ] ) the analytical solution for the @xmath48-matrix can be easily obtained .",
    "further details of the model are given in [ appccm ] .",
    "as in @xcite we assume that the diagonal interaction in the @xmath1 channel produces a weakly bound state in the absence of coupling to the other channels , thus simulating a `` molecular '' origin of the @xmath2 resonance .",
    "the state @xmath73 in channel 3 has a bare mass @xmath74 .     +    .[tfit]the model parameters obtained from the data fits .",
    "the fit 1 is based on using only the @xmath12 scattering data ( the phase @xmath75 and the inelasticity @xmath76 ) .",
    "the fits 24 include in addition the mass distribution @xmath77 in the decay @xmath78 : data from snd @xcite in fit  2 , from cmd-2 @xcite in fit  3 , and the combined data @xcite in fit  4 .",
    "the value of @xmath79 was fixed in all fits . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      +   +    the origin and the nature of the resonance poles found in our model can be elucidated by studying how these poles move in the complex @xmath63-plane when the model parameters are varied between the physical case determined by the fit and the limit of vanishing couplings in the @xmath12 channel and between the @xmath12 and the other channels ( @xmath1 and @xmath4 ) : @xmath80 the diagonal interaction in the @xmath1 channel with the _ physical _ strength of the coupling @xmath81 produces a bound state close to the @xmath1 threshold with mass @xmath82gev .",
    "+    our coupled channel model has only _ one _ pole @xmath83gev near the @xmath1 threshold , which is sufficient for a good description of the @xmath12 scattering data .",
    "this pole is directly related to a molecular @xmath1 state in the absence of coupling to the @xmath12 channel .",
    "the number of the @xmath3-matrix poles near the @xmath1 threshold has been discussed in the literature ( see @xcite and references therein ) for a long time . while the relation of the @xmath2 meson to at least one @xmath3-matrix pole close to @xmath1 threshold is well established , the exact location and even the number of the relevant @xmath3-matrix poles is model dependent as demonstrated in fig.[figsumf0 ] .",
    "the models based on dynamical input ( coupled channel , potential , unitarized chiral perturbation theory ) @xcite usually produce only one pole which can be traced to a weakly bound @xmath1 state in an appropriate limit of the channels coupling .",
    "one exception to this observation is a coupled channel model @xcite where the second pole near the @xmath1 threshold results from the interplay of a nearby @xmath4 pole with dynamical singularities .",
    "we were not able to find a good fit with the same feature in our model ; the main reason appears to be due to the using of the energy dependent potentials in eq.([vsep ] ) contrary to the case in @xcite .",
    "however , it is not excluded that two  pole solutions can be found with some other parametrization of interactions in ccm .",
    "it remains to be investigated whether two  pole solutions are compatible with the data on the @xmath0 decay .",
    "the @xmath84-matrix parameterizations @xcite routinely produce the second pole on sheet iii .",
    "there is , however , a much larger spread in this pole location than on sheet ii .",
    "as shown above , the reaction @xmath0 allows one to probe the scattering @xmath52 both above and below the @xmath1 threshold , and the @xmath12 mass distribution in @xmath0 is very sensitive to the @xmath3-matrix poles related to the @xmath2 .",
    "therefore more detailed experimental data on @xmath0 would be very useful for reducing the present uncertainty about the analytical structure of the @xmath3-matrix in the @xmath2 region .",
    "the mixing of the quark - antiquark states with the open meson channels can be studied in the ccm by using the probability sum rule for a resonance embedded into a continuum @xcite which is described in [ appccm ] .",
    "the spectral function @xmath85 which determines the probability density for the @xmath4 component in the scattering states , as defined by eq.([sumr ] ) , is shown in fig.[sd](a ) . in the case of weak coupling",
    ", the probability density would be well localized near the position of the bare @xmath4 state at @xmath86gev .",
    "for the physical case , we find a broad peak centered above the @xmath1 threshold in the region corresponding to the @xmath87 resonance ( the poles @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) .",
    "there is also a sizable contribution to the @xmath4 spectral density from the low  mass region of the @xmath90 meson .",
    "the @xmath85 distribution in the @xmath2 resonance has a characteristic dip - bump structure resulting from an interplay of the resonance pole @xmath91 with a nearby zero of the mass operator @xmath92 .",
    "the position and the width of the @xmath85 distribution indicates that an essential contribution to the saturation of the sum rule ( [ sumr ] ) comes from the pole @xmath93 related to the @xmath90 meson , while the narrow structure associated with the pole @xmath91 alone plays a minor role .",
    "the fact that @xmath4 coupling with the @xmath12 channel significantly enhances the spectral density @xmath85 in the region of the @xmath90 meson is related to the interplay of the @xmath3-matrix poles demonstrated in fig.[figpoles]c : the pole @xmath93 corresponding to the @xmath90 meson is pushed towards the @xmath12 threshold by the pole @xmath89 originating from the @xmath4 state .    using the spectral density @xmath85 we can calculate the contribution of the @xmath4 scalar mesons to the qcd sum rule related to the scalar quark condensate @xcite .",
    "figure  [ sd]b shows the laplace transform of the spectral density which is used in the sum rule analysis : @xmath94 the advantage of ccm with respect to the previous studies ( see @xcite and references therein ) where the contribution of the @xmath4 mesons was usually approximated by one narrow resonance is a more realistic shape of the @xmath4 spectral density in the low - mass region which is important in the laplace sum rules . as a result , the momenta @xmath95 and @xmath96 have quite different slopes in their @xmath97dependence as shown in fig.[sd](b ) .",
    "the theoretical calculations of the decays @xmath0 and @xmath5 and the corresponding experimental data are summarized in table  [ tabsum ] . the predicted branching ratios for the @xmath98 and @xmath99 channels",
    "should be compared with the experimental data with some caution .",
    "while these branching ratios can be easily defined theoretically ( @xmath100 for the isoscalar @xmath12 states , e.g. ) , the data analysis relies on the modeling of competing reaction mechanisms .",
    "in particular , the interpretation of the experimental results for the @xmath99 channel involves the consideration of the interference between the @xmath101 and @xmath102 mechanisms . in this respect ,",
    "we wish to emphasize again the importance of using a realistic @xmath49 amplitude instead of a simple superposition of bw resonances .",
    "the channel @xmath98 which is free from the @xmath103 meson contribution in the @xmath12 channel appears to be better suited for the study of the @xmath12 invariant mass distribution , although this case has some background due to the mechanism @xmath104 .",
    "our results are in good agreement with recent calculations within the chiral unitary approach @xcite both for the total width and for the @xmath12 mass distribution .",
    "this is not surprising because in both cases the @xmath2 resonance is produced mainly by the attractive interaction in the @xmath1 channel .",
    "our result for the total width @xmath105 is close to the earlier calculations of the two  step mechanism with the intermediate @xmath106 state @xcite which used the bw approximation ( [ gphigs ] ) with the coupling constant @xmath107 . in our model",
    "we can define an _ effective _ coupling constant @xmath108 by approximating the @xmath52 amplitude ( [ t12 ] ) by a bw resonance which leads to slightly higher value of @xmath109 .",
    "the effect of the form factor in the @xmath110 vertex was studied earlier in @xcite where a suppression by a factor of about 5 was given as an estimate .",
    "this significant suppression resulted from the use of a very soft dipole form factor with the characteristic parameter @xmath111gev ( eq.(4.14 ) in @xcite ) which was suggested by the study of the @xmath112 decay @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath113 decay is related to the short distance behavior of the @xmath1 wave function , while we are interested in the @xmath114 vertex at moderate relative momenta ( in general , there is no unique relation between these two properties , see the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "it is difficult to justify such a low value of the form  factor parameter in the ccm : a good fit of the scattering data requires much harder form factors as discussed in sec .  [ ccm ] .",
    "a weak effect of the form factor found in our case is consistent with the results in @xcite if the form  factor parameter @xmath115gev is used there .",

    "we use a well known result from nonrelativistic scattering theory : the residue of the scattering matrix at a pole corresponding to a bound state is uniquely related to the asymptotic normalization constant of the bound state wave function which for a weakly bound state depends , in leading order , only on the binding energy . for a weakly bound @xmath1 state , the relation between the @xmath108 and the binding energy @xmath142 has the form @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the range of the @xmath1 interaction .",
