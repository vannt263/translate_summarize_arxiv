    "we investigate a type of _ team competitions _ where there are two teams , each with a number of players , competing against each other .",
    "the competition proceeds in a fixed number of rounds . in each round",
    ", each team simultaneously sends out a player to a match .",
    "the result of the match is then revealed according to a probabilistic strength matrix between players .",
    "the selected players can not compete in the subsequent rounds .",
    "the competition proceeds to the next round if there is one ; or terminated otherwise .",
    "the format of the competition and the strength matrix are common knowledge to both teams .",
    "the final payoff of each team is the number of matches it wins .",
    "we also consider another commonly seen form where each team gets payoff @xmath0 if it wins strictly more matches than the other team , @xmath1 if ties , and @xmath2 if it wins less matches .",
    "clearly , the competition defines a standard _ extensive - form game _ , or more precisely , a _ stacked matrix game _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "we are interested in the sub - game perfect equilibria of the game , i.e. , a strategy profile that specifies for each team which player to play at each round .",
    "we are particularly interested in a situation where at least one team has more players than the number of rounds in the competition . as a result",
    ", some players will never have chance to participate in any match .",
    "the main agenda of this paper is to understand to what extent can the presence of additional players affect the payoff of both teams .",
    "in particular , we ask the following questions :    1 .   can the presence of additional weakest teammate , a teammate whose row in the strength matrix is strictly dominated by any other row , help increase the payoff of the team ? 2 .",
    "can the presence of additional dominated teammate , a teammate that always loses to any player in the opponent team , help increase the payoff of the team ?",
    "it might appear intuitive that the answers to both questions are negative .",
    "for the first question , it seems that the weakest teammate will never have a chance to participate in any match since one can always replace him by a better teammate and increase payoff .",
    "for the second question , it might seem more obvious since the dominated teammate will lose any matches thus must be replaced by a better teammate . to our surprise , we find that the answers to both questions are affirmative .",
    "we first show that uniformly random strategy is a sub- game perfect equilibrium strategy for both teams when there are no redundant players ( i.e. , the number of players in each team equals to the number of rounds of the competition ) .",
    "the uniformly random strategy always picks the unmatched player uniformly at random in each round .",
    "then , we consider the general case where at least one team has redundant players .",
    "we first study the case where the strength of players is transitive , which means that the players can be rearranged in a queue so that each of them is weaker than its successor .",
    "we prove that , a team can safely abandon its weak players if it has redundant players and the strength of players is transitive .",
    "therefore , this case reduces to the case where there are no redundant players .    finally , we focus on the case where there are redundant players and the strength of players is not transitive . in this case , we obtain a number of counterintuitive results .",
    "most importantly , a player might help improve its team s payoff , even if it is dominated by the entire opposing team .",
    "we give a necessary condition for a dominated player to be useful , which alternatively suggest that a particular utility function ( named @xmath3 below ) is more reasonable in team competition .",
    "our results imply that a team can increase its utility by recruiting additional dominated players .",
    "we further show that , the optimal number of dominated players to recruit can scale with the number of rounds .",
    "more precisely , this number can be @xmath4 if there are @xmath5 rounds .",
    "last but not least , we study the limitation of dominated players .",
    "our model is first motivated by the chinese horse race story described in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it represents one of the most popular forms of horse races where each team ranks its horses to match sequentially .",
    "moreover , the swaythling cup , as known as world table tennis championships , follows the same model described in our paper : each team adaptively selects a ranking of three players and brings two additional substitutes .",
    "in fact , this has been one of the most popular formats of team competition in table tennis .",
    "in addition , the card game goofspeil ( @xcite ) also falls into nearly the same model as described in our paper .",
    "tang , shoham and lin  @xcite study a team competition setting where the number of players equals the number of rounds and both teams must determine the ordering of players upfront , before the competition starts .",
    "they put forward competition rules that are truthful while satisfy other desirable properties .",
    "the main difference between their work and ours is that we do not design new mechanisms but study game theoretical properties of commonly used competition rules .",
    "the differences also lie in that the strategies are adaptive in our setting and each team can have more players than the number of matches .",
    "the strategic aspects of team competition have also been under scrutiny of computer scientists due to a recent olympic scandal in badminton , where several teams deliberately throw matches in order to avoid a strong opponent in the next round .",
    "the phenomenon has been discussed in depth in a series of algorithmic game theory blogposts by kleinberg  @xcite and procaccia  @xcite .    a parallel literature has been concerned with the strategic aspect of tournament seeding  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that there are cases where by strategic seeding and structuring , any player can be winner in knockout tournament .",
    "various game theoretical questions , such as player - optimal seeding , complexity of manipulation and incentives to guarantee strategyproofness , have been investigated in this literature .",
    "team  1 has a set of @xmath6 players @xmath7 .",
    "team  2 has a set of @xmath8 players @xmath9 .",
    "a competition between team 1 and 2 is a tuple @xmath10 where ,    1 .",
    "@xmath5 is the number of rounds . 2 .",
    "in each round , each team simultaneously selects one of its players that have not been selected yet .",
    "3 .   @xmath11 is a probabilistic matrix that describes the relative strength between players , with @xmath12 denoting the probability that @xmath13 wins against @xmath14 and @xmath15 the probability for @xmath13 to lose to @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath16\\rightarrow r$ ] denotes the utility function of each team .",
    "the utility function only depends on the number of rounds @xmath17 each team wins , i.e. , it can be represented by @xmath18 .",
    "this also implies that both teams have the same utility functions .",
    "the parameters @xmath19 are common knowledge to both teams , and historical plays are perfectly observable . it is assured that @xmath20 $ ] for all @xmath21 and that @xmath22 and @xmath23 so that there are enough players to complete the competition .",
    "the following utility functions @xmath3 and @xmath24 are two commonly seen ones :    @xmath25    in other words , @xmath3 describes a competition where a team s utility is exactly the number of rounds it wins ( minus some constant @xmath26 ) ; while @xmath27 describes a competition where a team s utility is whether it wins more than its opponent .",

    "in each deck one card is in suit  @xmath32 and two cards are in suit  @xmath33 .",
    "they play three rounds ; in each round alice and bob select one card and they reveal the cards simultaneously .",
    "if they select cards in same suit ( both in @xmath32 or both in @xmath33 ) , alice wins this round ; otherwise bob wins this round .",
    "the one who wins two or three rounds gets utility 1 ; the other one wins zero or one rounds and it gets utility -1 .",
    "this game can be conveniently represented in our model using the following parameters : @xmath34 for this game , according to our first theorem , a ( subgame perfect ) equilibrium strategy for both players exists , and it is to just to play uniformly random .",
    "it follows that alice has expected utility @xmath35 and bob has @xmath36 .",

    "a behavioral strategy in this game is a mapping from every history to a probability distribution over actions .",

    ", there is a subgame perfect equilibrium ( spe ) , in which both teams use behavioral strategies .",
    "according to the spe , a value @xmath43 can be defined for each history @xmath44 , which indicates the expected utility that team  1 would get at the end of the game if it is now at history @xmath44 .",
    "note that each history is the root of a subgame and so the value of a history is the same as the value of the subgame .      by backward induction",
    ", one can easily get    two histories have the same value if they have selected the same players to play ( but may be in different orders ) and team  1 won the same number of rounds .",

    "we can compute the value of all equivalent classes of histories according to the above induction .",

    "furthermore , if team  1 wins the second round ( say @xmath89 beats @xmath169 ) it can also wins the next ( let @xmath163 beat @xmath167 ) and thus gets utility 1 . by this strategy ,",
    "there is @xmath92 chance to get utility 1 and @xmath92 chance to get utility @xmath2 , so the expected utility is @xmath1 .",
    "however , for the game @xmath177 , we do not lose any utility by abandoning the dominated player .",
    "this is not a coincidence .",
    "in fact , this example belongs to a special case where the weakest player can indeed be abandoned .",
    "we show this in the next theorem .",
    "we have seen that the weakest redundant player is useless when the players are transitive ( as proved in theorem  [ thm : transitive ] ) but might be useful when the players are not transitive ( as shown in the previous subsection ) .",
    "so , the next question is :    if the players are not transitive , on what cases the weakest player can be abandoned ?",
    "we get the following result .",
    "[ thm : special ] suppose that team  1 has redundant players but team  2 does not .",
    "so , @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "suppose that each player in @xmath180 is weaker than each player in @xmath181 .",
    "let @xmath28 .",
    "then , team  1 can abandon all the players in @xmath180 without losing its utility .",
    "before we give the proof , we make two remarks .    \\1 .",
    "the condition @xmath182 is important for theorem  [ thm : special ] .",
    "if both team got redundant players , then the claim in this theorem does not hold anymore .    \\2 .",
    "from example  [ example : largest ] , we see that the claim in this theorem fails when @xmath29 . therefore , as a comparison , by recruiting extra dominated players , a team can gain more utility when @xmath29 , but can not when @xmath28 .",
    "this may suggest that @xmath3 is more reasonable than @xmath24 in team competition .",
    "we need the following lemma on proving theorem  [ thm : special ] .",
    "it is a technical statement of probability theory .",
    "proof omitted .",
    "[ lemma : probability ] assume that @xmath179 and @xmath62 are any pair of players from the two teams .",
    "let @xmath183 denote the probability that @xmath13 meets @xmath14 in the game when team  2 applies the uniformly random strategy and team  1 applies some strategy @xmath146 .",
    "then , @xmath184    we call @xmath180 the weak players . when the weak players are abandoned , there are @xmath5 remaining players for each team . by theorem  [ thm :",
    "random ] , the uniformly random strategy is a spe strategy for team  2 . to prove theorem  [ thm : special ] ,",
    "the key idea is to show that even if team  1 is allowed to select the weak player , it will not gain more utility if team  2 keep using the uniformly random strategy . on the other hand ,",
    "it is obvious that team  2 ca nt gain more utility .",
    "therefore , the value of game does not change when the weak players are allowed to play .",
    "when team  1 abandons its weak players , its maximum utility is @xmath185    let @xmath186 be defined as lemma  [ lemma : probability ] .",
    "the utility of team  1 when it applies strategy @xmath146 against the uniformly random strategy of team  2 is @xmath187    we need to prove that @xmath188 , and it reduces to show that for any fixed @xmath76 in @xmath189 , @xmath190    to prove ( [ eqn : compare ] ) , consider the following optimization problem : @xmath191    clearly , @xmath192 is maximized at @xmath193 , where @xmath194 .",
    "noticing the following facts , we see that inequality ( [ eqn : compare ] ) is just an application of the above problem . @xmath195      here we study the power of dominated players in another direction .",
    "as we see in subsection  [ subsect : useful ] , by abandoning a redundant dominated player , team  1 may decrease its utility .",
    "in other words , it states that team  1 may increase its utility by recruiting more dominated players .",
    "note that the utility of team  1 will not decrease by recruiting more dominated players .",
    "however , it is unclear that the utility will strictly increase by doing so .",
    "for example , it is clear that recruiting @xmath5 dominated players is the same as recruiting @xmath196 players  in any case , if any team uses @xmath5 dominated players in a competition , it gets the lowest utility !",
    "so , a natural question is ,    in order to get the maximum utility , how many dominated players should we recruit at least ?",
    "is it possible that we need as many as @xmath4 such players ?",
    "the theorem below answers this question .",
    "[ thm : number_burdens ]     1 .",
