    "recent determinations of the angular power spectrum of the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite have created much excitement . these data may be used to estimate cosmological parameters .",
    "the maximum in the angular power spectrum around the multipole value @xmath0 ( the first peak ) is consistent with inflation and vanishing mean spatial curvature @xcite .",
    "the lack of curvature adds compelling evidence to the case for the existence of some smoothly  distributed negative  pressure component which is possibly a cosmological constant ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the constraints on the amplitude of the predicted second peak lead to lower limits on the baryon density @xcite which are in conflict with the standard results from big bang nucleosynthesis ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; new data are eagerly awaited to provide a resolution .",
    "fortunately , future satellite missions will provide angular power spectrum determinations with greatly improved precision @xcite .",
    "the extraction of cosmological parameters from the cmbanisotropy data requires a long and computer  intensive analysis chain .",
    "here we are interested in the last step in the chain which is a derivation of cosmological parameters from the inferred angular power spectrum , @xmath1 .",
    "this last step is computer  intensive as well and promises to be more so as the number of parameters in ones model increases .",
    "current analysis exercises have included up to ten parameters@xcite ; the scalar quadrupole and gravity wave perturbation normalizations ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) , the scalar and tensor power  law indices for primordial perturbations ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) , the reionization optical depth @xmath6 , the spatial curvature @xmath7 , the energy densities for baryonic matter ( @xmath8 ) , cold dark matter ( @xmath9 ) , neutrinos ( @xmath10 ) and the vacuum ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "other logical cosmological parameters could include the number of neutrino families and their masses .",
    "potentially infinite degrees of freedom lie in the primordial spectrum of perturbations .",
    "the estimation of parameters can be thought of as an exercise in bayesian inference .",
    "one starts with the likelihood function , namely the conditional probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the observation @xmath12 _ given _ the unknown parameters , @xmath13 . for studies pertaining to the cmb",
    ", the likelihood used is an approximation to the probability of the power spectrum given the data , e.g. @xcite .",
    "if the likelihood function for a certain parameter vector @xmath14 is higher than for a parameter vector @xmath15 , the observations are more likely to have occurred under @xmath16 than under @xmath17 .",
    "thus , the observations give higher plausibility to @xmath18 and finding the parameter value that maximizes the likelihood seems to have some compelling logic .",
    "however , the only consistent way to quantify one s uncertainty about an _ unknown _ parameter @xmath19 is by specifying a probability distribution or equivalently a pdf for the parameter . after observing the data , this distribution should be updated to the pdf of the parameter _ given _ the data by incorporating the gained information .",
    "we are not interested in the pdf of the data given the _",
    "@xmath19 but in the pdf of @xmath20 given the _ known _ data ; we want the `` inverse probability '' , not @xmath21 but @xmath22 .",
    "the only coherent approach to update a _ prior _ probability distribution with experimental information consists of calculating the _ posterior _ pdf via bayes theorem : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the marginal pdf of @xmath12 .",
    "the denominator can be regarded as a normalization constant since it is independent of @xmath19 .",
    "the posterior pdf thus combines prior with likelihood information .",
    "a bayesian point estimate of the unknown parameter would be the posterior mean , median , or mode .",
    "the usual difficulties of bayesian inference apply here : namely , the challenge of high  dimensional integration .",
    "one needs to be able to perform high - dimensional integrations when calculating the normalization constant @xmath25 , for instance , or when calculating the marginal pdf of a single component of the parameter vector @xmath19 by integrating out all the other components , or when calculating posterior means .",
    "one of the main objectives of this paper is to demonstrate the potential of what statisticians refer to as simulation  based integration techniques for bayesian posterior computation of cmb model parameters .",
    "these are called simulation  based , not because there is any simulation of the data , but because the posterior distribution is simulated . the particular simulation ",
    "based method we use here generates a set of parameter vectors whose distribution simulates the posterior distribution .",
    "analyses of cosmological parameter constraints from the most recent angular power spectrum determinations start with the calculation of the likelihood on an @xmath26dimensional grid , where @xmath26 is the number of parameters @xcite .",
    "the next step is then the reduction of this large amount of data to a series of one or two  dimensional probability distributions functions which can easily be plotted .",
    "this is achieved by marginalizing over the other variables ; i.e. , integrating over them .",
    "note that some times ( and in all applications for at least some of the variables ) this marginalization is approximated by a _ maximization _ over the other variables .",
    "the chief drawback to the grid ",
    "based approach is the exponential increase in computing times and storage requirements with increasing number of parameters",
    ". even with @xmath27 ( plus a handful of instrumental parameters ) overly coarse grids and approximate treatment of some of the marginalizations are necessary to make the problem tractable .",
    "including more parameters , for example ones that describe instrumental effects , foreground contaminants , or departures of the primordial power spectrum from a strict power ",
    "law , will make the grid  based approaches even more difficult if not impossible .    in this paper",
    "we implement the bayesian approach to estimation of cosmological parameters using computer  intensive markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) methods .",
    "impediments to multidimensional integrations have been overcome by the progress made within the last decade in bayesian computational technology via mcmc methods @xcite . since its initial application in digital signal analysis @xcite mcmc  methods",
    "have revolutionized many areas of applied statistics and we expect there to be an impact on cosmological parameter estimation from cmb measurements as well .",
    "a distinct advantage of the mcmc  approach is that computational time does not grow exponentially with parameter number , as it does for other methods @xcite .",
    "mcmc  techniques have been applied in numerous areas , from science to economics @xcite .",
    "applications of state ",
    "space modeling in finance , e.g. stochastic volatility models applied to time series of daily exchange rates or returns of stock exchange indices , easily have 10005000 parameters @xcite .",
    "specially tailored mcmc algorithms can markedly improve the calculational speed @xcite .",
    "hence , the mcmc approach to cosmological parameter estimation may provide the best strategy when testing complex models with numerous parameters .",
    "we test our mcmc parameter estimation routine using simulated data .",
    "the likelihood is produced via a prototype fast calculator@xcite .",
    "the toy model depends on four parameters .",
    "we demonstrate the validity of the technique with this example .",
    "the goal of our research is to apply mcmcmethods to real cmb data , and we are currently optimizing our routines for this multiparameter ( 10 ) analysis .",
    "we are optimistic since experience has generally shown scaling of computing times with the number of parameters to be slower than exponential @xcite .",
    "in section 2 we review methods that have been used to estimate cosmological parameters from cmb  measurements , plus techniques for calculating likelihoods . in section 3",
    "we describe the bayesian approach to statistical inference and its implementation via markov chain monte carlo methods . in section 4",
    "we describe a method for applying mcmc  methods to cosmological parameter estimation with cmb  data .",
    "we test our method with a four parameter example , and our results are presented in section 5 .",
    "section 6 presents our conclusions .",
    "parameter estimation from cmb data is usually performed with a multi  step process , the last two steps of which are determining the power  spectrum from a map ( or otherwise  pixelized data ) @xcite , and then determining the cosmological parameters from the power spectrum .",
    "to date it has been impractical to go straight from the map to the parameters because of the computational expense of evaluating the probability of the map given the parameters thousands of times . fortunately , the structure of the probability of the map given the power spectrum ( the likelihood of the power spectrum ) is much simpler than that of the map given the parameters .",
    "the simple structure allows for the mode to be found in a small number of iterations of a levenberg ",
    "type search algorithm @xcite .",
    "this `` radical '' compression of the information in the map to information in the power spectrum is possible because we assume that the signal in the maps is gaussian and statistically isotropic .",
    "however , the uncertainties in the resulting power spectrum are not normally  distributed and the above search procedures do not allow one to completely characterize the distribution .",
    "fortunately there are analytic approximations to the complete distribution whose parameters one can calculate with minor adaptations of the power  spectrum mode search algorithms @xcite .    the most recent attempts at determining cosmological parameters ( @xcite ) are in fact attempts to determine the posterior probability distribution of the cosmological parameters under various prior assumptions .",
    "the first step is to evaluate the likelihood on a grid of cosmological parameters . to have constraints of reduced  dimensionality ( one or two ) suitable for plotting , one marginalizes over the other parameters .",
    "sometimes marginalization is approximated by simply maximizing over the remaining parameters .",
    "this approximation is exact if the marginalized parameters are normally distributed .",
    "direct grid  based evaluations of the likelihood have computation time and storage requirements which rise exponentially with the number of parameters .",
    "such approaches will be difficult to implement for models of greater complexity than have been studied so far .",
    "further , the maximization approximation to marginalization can sometimes lead to spurious results .",
    "numerical maximization techniques , such as the levenberg  marquardt method , are only guaranteed to find a local maximum .",
    "once they have reached a local maximum they might get stuck in their search and not reach the global maximum .",
    "for this reason statisticians have applied _ simulated annealing _ , which is a technique for global optimization .",
    "simulated annealing has been attempted for cosmological parameter estimation @xcite .",
    "simulated annealing is related to mcmc as its core component is the metropolis hastings algorithm . in this method",
    "the parameter space is searched in a random way .",
    "a new parameter space point is reached with a probability that depends on the likelihood and an _ effective temperature _ term . in the limit where the temperature approaches zero",
    "the _ thermodynamics _ of this parameter space search finds the system approaching the maximum of the likelihood .",
    "although these methods are applicable to high  dimensional problems , they can be very inefficient in certain situations .",
    "furthermore , there is no guarantee that the global maximum will be reached in a finite time .",
    "the efficiency depends very much on specifying a good cooling schedule which involves the arbitrary and skillful choice of various cooling parameters .",
    "implicit in the problem of parameter estimation , whether from a frequentist or bayesian perspective , is the calculation of the likelihood of the observed power spectrum ( determined from a map ) given some cosmological model .",
    "thus likelihood calculation requires us to be able to calculate the angular power spectrum for a given model ( with its associated cosmological parameters ) .",
    "this calculational task is accomplished with computer codes such as cmbfast @xcite or camb @xcite .",
    "these codes accept the cosmological parameters as input , and return the angular power spectrum of the cmbanisotropies , @xmath28 .",
    "these software packages serve as the work  horses of current cmb  parameter  determination efforts .",
    "for example , the likelihood has been calculated 30,311,820 times in order to cover a region in a ten  dimensional cosmological parameter space @xcite .",
    "in other studies the likelihood was evaluated as needed within the calculation @xcite .",
    "parameter estimation can be comprehensively described within the language of bayesian inference .",
    "application of bayes theorem is well  suited to astrophysical observations @xcite . in bayesian data analysis the model consists of a joint distribution over all unobserved ( parameters ) and observed ( data ) quantities .",
    "one conditions on the data to obtain the posterior distribution of the parameters .",
    "the starting point of the bayesian approach to statistical inference is setting up a full probability model that consists of the _ joint _ probability distribution of all observables , denoted by @xmath29 and unobservable quantities , denoted by @xmath30 . using the notion of conditional probability , this joint pdf ,",
    "@xmath31can be decomposed into the product of the pdf of all unobservables , @xmath32 , referred to as the _ prior _ pdf of @xmath19 , and the conditional pdf of the observables given the unobservables , @xmath33 , referred to as the sampling distribution or _ likelihood _ ,",
    "i.e.   @xmath34 the prior pdf contains all the information about the unobservables that is known from substantive knowledge and expert opinion _ before _ observing the data .",
    "all the information about the @xmath19 that stems from the experiment is contained in the likelihood . in the light of the data",
    ", the bayesian paradigm then updates the prior knowledge about @xmath35 , @xmath32 , to the _ posterior _ pdf of @xmath19 , @xmath22 .",
    "this is done via an application of bayes theorem through conditioning on the observations @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the marginal pdf of @xmath12 which can be regarded as a normalizing constant as it is independent of @xmath35 .",
    "the bayesian approach is based on the likelihood function but also quantifies the uncertainty about the parameters through a joint prior distribution that summarizes the available information about the parameters before observing the data . in the light of the observations ,",
    "the information about the unknown parameters is then updated via bayes theorem to the posterior distribution which is proportional to the product of likelihood and prior density @xcite .    as already mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the main difficulty with the bayesian approach to parameter estimation is high  dimensional integration . to calculate the normalizing constant of the joint posterior pdf , for instance , requires @xmath38dimensional integration .",
    "having obtained the joint posterior pdf of @xmath19 , the posterior pdf of a single parameter @xmath39 of interest can be obtained by integrating out all the other components , i.e. @xmath40 calculation of the posterior mean of @xmath39 necessitates a further integration , e.g.  @xmath41=\\int \\theta _ { i}p(\\theta _ { i}| \\mathbf{z})d\\theta _ { i}$ ] .",
    "this procedure is referred to as marginalization .    only in the simplest situations",
    "can these integrals be solved analytically .",
    "the main approximate techniques are normal and laplace approximations based on asymptotics , quadrature approximations , monte carlo integrations , and stochastic simulation .",
    "mcmc methods belong to the last category . for an overview",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the deterministic techniques rely upon approximate normality and asymptotic results in the sense of the sample size growing to infinity .",
    "these techniques were mostly developed before the immense technological advances that enabled computer  intensive methods to be applied .",
    "the complexity of these techniques increases substantially with the dimension of the parameter space . in very broad terms",
    ", experience suggests that deterministic techniques provide good results for low  dimensional models .",
    "similar comments are valid for non  iterative simulation techniques , since finding a suitable auxiliary distribution in rejections or importance sampling , for instance , becomes an extremely difficult task for high dimensions .",
    "as the dimension of the model increases , only iterative simulation  based integration techniques such as sampling  importance resampling ( sir ) or mcmc provide adequate solutions",
    ". one major advantage of using a sampling  based approach to posterior computation is that once a sample from the posterior pdf , say @xmath42 is available , we can employ this to estimate the posterior mean of each parameter by the sample average of the corresponding component , the marginal pdf s using kernel density estimates , and correlation between parameters using the sample correlations .    to avoid a time  consuming direct sampling of the joint posterior we propose a mcmc method @xcite . instead of generating a sequence of independent samples from the joint posterior , in mcmc",
    "a markov chain is constructed whose equilibrium distribution is just the joint posterior .",
    "thus , after running the markov chain for a certain _ burn  in _ period , one obtains ( correlated ) samples from the limiting distribution , provided that the markov chain has reached convergence .",
    "one method for constructing a markov chain is via the metropolis ",
    "hastings algorithm .",
    "the mh algorithm was developed by metropolis _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and generalized by hastings @xcite .",
    "it is a mcmc method which means that it generates a markov chain whose equilibrium distribution is just the target density , here the joint posterior pdf @xmath43 .",
    "this means that after sampling from this markov chain for a sufficiently long time to allow the chain to reach equilibrium , the samples can be regarded as samples from the joint posterior pdf .",
    "the mh algorithm shares the concept of a generating pdf with the well  known simulation technique of _ rejection sampling _",
    ", where a candidate is generated from an auxiliary pdf and then accepted or rejected with some probability .",
    "however , the candidate generating pdf , @xmath44 can now depend on the current state @xmath45 of the markov chain .",
    "a new candidate @xmath46 is accepted with a certain _ acceptance probability _",
    "@xmath47 also depending on the current state @xmath48 given by : @xmath49 if @xmath50 and @xmath51 otherwise .",
