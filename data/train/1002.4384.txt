    "in the historical conference _ combinatoire numerative _ that took place at the end of may 1985 , in montreal , richard stanley raised some intriguing problems about the enumeration of plane partitions ( see below ) , which he later expanded into a fascinating article  @xcite .",
    "most of these problems concerned the enumeration of `` symmetry classes '' of plane partitions that were discussed in more detail in another article of stanley  @xcite .",
    "all of the conjectures in the latter article have since been proved ( see david bressoud s modern classic  @xcite ) , except one , which until now resisted the efforts of the greatest minds in enumerative combinatorics .",
    "it concerns the proof of an explicit formula for the @xmath0-enumeration of totally symmetric plane partitions , conjectured , ca .",
    "1983 , independently by george andrews and david robbins  ( @xcite , @xcite conj .  7 , @xcite conj",
    ".  13 , and already alluded to in @xcite ) . in the present article",
    "we finally turn this conjecture into a theorem .",
    "a plane partition @xmath1 is an array @xmath2 , of positive integers @xmath3 with finite sum @xmath4 , which is weakly decreasing in rows and columns so that @xmath5 and @xmath6 . a plane partition  @xmath1 is identified with its 3d ferrers diagram which is obtained by stacking @xmath3 unit cubes on top of the location  @xmath7 .",
    "this gives a left- , back- , and bottom - justified structure in which we can refer to the locations @xmath8 of the individual unit cubes .",
    "if the diagram is invariant under the action of the symmetric group  @xmath9 then @xmath1 is called a totally symmetric plane partition ( tspp ) . in other words , @xmath1 is called totally symmetric if whenever a location @xmath8 in the diagram is occupied then all its up to  @xmath10 permutations @xmath11 are occupied as well .",
    "such a set of cubes , i.e. , all cubes to which a certain cube can be moved via @xmath9 is called an orbit ; the set of all orbits of  @xmath1 forms a partition of its diagram ( see figure  [ tsppfigure ] ) .",
    "[ tsppfigure ] .",
    "the yellow cubes form an orbit of length  @xmath12 ( corresponding to all permutations of @xmath13 ) , the red cubes an orbit of length  @xmath14 ( all permutations of @xmath15 ) , and the green cube on location @xmath16 represents an orbit of length  @xmath17.,title=\"fig:\",width=283 ]    in 1995 , john stembridge  @xcite proved ian macdonald s conjecture that the number of totally symmetric plane partitions with largest part at most  @xmath18 , i.e. , those whose 3d ferrers diagram is contained in the cube @xmath19 ^ 3 $ ] , is given by the elegant product - formula @xmath20 ten years after stembridge s completely human - generated proof , andrews , peter paule and carsten schneider  @xcite came up with a computer - assisted proof based on an ingenious matrix decomposition , but since no @xmath0-analog of their decomposition was found , their proof could not be extended to a proof for the @xmath0-case . a third proof of stembridge s theorem  @xcite , completely computer - generated , was recently found in the context of our investigations of the @xmath0-tspp conjecture .",
    "we have now succeeded in completing all the required computations for an analogous proof of the @xmath0-tspp conjecture , and can therefore announce :    [ qtsppthm ] let @xmath21 denote the set of orbits of a plane partition  @xmath1 under the action of the symmetric group  @xmath9 . then the orbit - counting generating function ( @xcite , @xcite ) is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the set of totally symmetric plane partitions with largest part at most  @xmath18 .",
    "our proof is based on a result by soichi okada  @xcite who has shown that the theorem is implied by a certain  conjectured  determinant evaluation .",
    "these preliminaries are stated accurately in section  [ secreduction ] below , followed by a description of the holonomic ansatz  @xcite that we are going to pursue .",
    "this approach relies on a kind of oracle that tells us a description of a certificate function  @xmath24 ; the odyssey how this function has been `` guessed '' is described in section  [ secguess ] .",
    "once @xmath24 is known , the determinant evaluation reduces further to proving the three identities , , and stated below . in section  [ secproof ]",
    "we come full circle by proving these identities .",
    "additional technical details of the proof and our computations as well as the explicit certificates are provided electronically on our website ( http://www.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/people/ckoutsch/qtspp/ ) .",
    "our proof is noteworthy not only for its obvious significance in enumerative combinatorics , as it settles a long - standing conjecture , attempted by many people .",
    "it is noteworthy also for computational reasons , as the computations we performed went far beyond what has been thought to be possible with currently known algebraic algorithms , software packages , and computer hardware .",
    "in order to prove the @xmath0-tspp conjecture , we exploit an elegant reduction by okada  @xcite to the problem of evaluating a certain determinant . this determinant is also listed as conjecture  46 in christian krattenthaler s essay  @xcite on the art of determinant evaluation .",
    "let , as usual , @xmath25 be the kronecker delta function and let , also as usual , @xmath26 denote the @xmath0-binomial coefficient .",
    "define the discrete function @xmath27 by : @xmath28 okada s crucial insight is that theorem  [ qtsppthm ] holds if @xmath29 so for proving the @xmath0-tspp conjecture , it is sufficient to prove this conjectured determinant evaluation . for this purpose",
    "we apply a computational approach originally proposed in  @xcite which is applicable to identities of the form @xmath30 where @xmath27 and @xmath31 ( with @xmath32 for all @xmath33 ) are given explicitly ( as it is the case here ) .",
    "the approach rests on the following induction argument on  @xmath18 . for @xmath34 ,",
    "the identity is trivial .",
    "suppose the identity holds for @xmath35 ; then the linear system @xmath36 has a unique solution @xmath37 .",
    "the component @xmath24 of this solution is precisely the @xmath38-cofactor divided by the @xmath39-cofactor of the @xmath40-determinant .",
    "the division is meaningful because the @xmath39-cofactor is just the @xmath41-determinant , which by induction hypothesis is equal to  @xmath42 , which by general assumption is nonzero . since the @xmath40-determinant can be expressed in terms of the matrix entries @xmath43 and the normalized cofactors @xmath24 via @xmath44 the induction step is completed by showing that this sum evaluates to  @xmath31 .",
    "the difficulty is that this last summation involves the function  @xmath24 ( of the discrete variables @xmath18 and @xmath45 ) for which we do not have an explicit expression for general  @xmath18 and  @xmath45 . in order to achieve our goal",
    ", we guess a suitable description of a function @xmath24 and then prove that it satisfies the three identities @xmath46 once this is done , then by the argument given before the  @xmath24 must be precisely the normalized @xmath38-cofactors of the @xmath40-determinant and the determinant evaluation follows as a consequence .",
    "so in a sense , the function  @xmath24 plays the rle of a certificate for the determinant identity .",
    "in our the setting the certificate function @xmath24 will be described implicitly by a system of linear recurrence equations in @xmath18 and @xmath45 with coefficients depending polynomially on @xmath0 , @xmath47 and  @xmath48 .",
    "such recurrence equations can be phrased as the elements of some noncommutative operator algebras @xmath49 $ ] where the symbols @xmath50 represent the shifts @xmath51 .",
    "if a function is annihilated by certain operators ( viz.it satisfies certain recurrence equations ) , then it is also annihilated by all the elements in the ( left ) ideal generated by those operators .",
    "we speak of an annihilating ideal and represent such ideals by ( left ) grbner bases , so that for instance ideal membership can be decided effectively .",
    "the annihilating ideals we use for representing functions are such that they uniquely determine the function up to some finitely many initial values .",
    "technically , this means that the ideals have dimension zero and that some particular polynomial coefficients appearing in the recurrence system must not vanish simultaneously for infinitely many points  @xmath38 .",
    "these recurrence systems are similar but somewhat simpler than @xmath0-holonomic systems  @xcite , which satisfy some additional requirements that are not needed for our proof .",
    "we have checked that all the ideals arising in our proof are indeed of the desired form , but in the interest of clarity we suppress a more detailed description of these checks here . for a complete analysis including all technical details we refer to the supplementary material on our website .",
    "also in the interest of clarity , we will from now on identify recurrence equations with their corresponding operators .",
    "a priori , there is no reason why the normalized cofactors @xmath24 should admit a recursive description of the kind we are aiming at , but there is also no reason why they should not .",
    "it turns out that they do , and this is fortunate because for functions described in this way , techniques are known by which the required identities  , and can be proven algorithmically  @xcite . in order to find a recursive description for  @xmath24",
    ", we first computed explicitly the normalized cofactors @xmath52 for a few hundred specific indices",
    "@xmath18 and @xmath45 by directly solving the linear system quoted in section  [ secreduction ] . using an algorithm reminiscent of polynomial interpolation , we then constructed a set of recurrences compatible with the values of @xmath24 at the ( finitely many ) indices we computed .",
    "polynomial interpolation applied to a finite sample @xmath53 of an infinite sequence @xmath54 will always deliver some polynomial  @xmath55 of degree at most @xmath56 which matches the given data . if it turns out that this polynomial matches some further sequence terms @xmath57 , then it is tempting to conjecture that @xmath58 for all  @xmath18 .",
    "the more specific points  @xmath18 are found to match , the higher is the evidence in favor of this conjecture , even though without further knowledge no finite amount of points will ever constitute a rigorous proof .",
    "very much analogously , it is possible to extract recurrence equations from some finite number of values  @xmath24 .",
    "the equations become trustworthy if they also hold for points  @xmath38 which were not used for their construction . in this way , we have discovered a system of potential recurrence equations for the  @xmath24 , which , despite being respectable in size ( about 30 megabytes ) , appears to be a rather plausible candidate for a recursive description of the normalized cofactors  @xmath24 .",
    "the system is available for download on our website .",
    "now we switch our point of view .",
    "we discard the definition that @xmath24 be the normalized @xmath38-cofactor and redefine the discrete function @xmath24 as the unique solution of the guessed recurrence system whose ( finitely many ) initial values agree with the normalized @xmath38-cofactor .",
    "if we succeed in proving that @xmath24 defined in this way satisfies the identities  , and , then we are done . for this purpose",
    "we provide operators which belong to the annihilating ideal of @xmath24 or related ideals and have certain features which imply the desired identities .",
    "so in a sense , these operators play the rle of certificates for the identities under consideration .",
    "because of their astronomical size ( up to 7  gigabytes ; equivalent to more than one million printed pages ; corresponding to about 2.5  tons of paper ) , these certificates are not included explicitly in this article but provided only electronically on our website . also because of their size , it was not possible to construct them by simply applying the standard algorithms from  @xcite . a detailed explanation of how exactly we found the certificates is beyond the scope of this article and will be given in a separate publication .",
    "but this lack of explanation does not at all affect the soundness of our proof , because the correctness of the certificates can be checked independently by simply performing ideal membership tests .",
    "our certificates are so big that even this `` simple '' calculation is not quite trivial , but a reader with a sufficient amount of patience and programming expertise will be able to do it .",
    "we proceed by explaining the properties of the certificates provided on our website and why they imply , and .",
    "to certify that @xmath59 for all @xmath33 , we provide a recurrence in the annihilating ideal of @xmath24 which is of the special form @xmath60 by virtue of the substitution @xmath61 , it translates into a recurrence for the diagonal sequence  @xmath62 .",
    "this recurrence contains the annihilating operator @xmath63 of the constant sequence  @xmath17 as a ( right ) factor , and therefore , after checking @xmath64 , it can be concluded that @xmath59 for all  @xmath18 .",
    "similarly , we showed that @xmath65 for all @xmath33 and that @xmath66 for all @xmath67 .",
    "this knowledge greatly simplifies the following proofs of the summation identities .      in order to prove the first summation identity , we translate   into the equivalent formulation @xmath68 taking into account that @xmath65 .",
    "we provide certificates for  .    to this end , let  @xmath69 be the summand of the sum on the left - hand side .",
    "a recursive description for @xmath69 can be computed directly from the defining equations of @xmath24 and the fact that the rest of the summand is a @xmath0-hypergeometric factor . in the corresponding operator",
    "ideal  @xmath70 we were able to find two different recurrence equations for @xmath69 which are of the special form @xmath71 where the @xmath72 are rational functions in @xmath73 and @xmath74 is a @xmath75-linear combination of certain shifts of @xmath69 ( which are determined by the grbner basis of  @xmath70 as described in  @xcite ) .",
    "next observe that @xmath76 for @xmath77 ( because of the @xmath0-binomial coefficient ) and also for @xmath67 ( because @xmath66 for @xmath67 ) .",
    "when summing the two recurrence equations for @xmath45 from @xmath78 to @xmath79 , the right - hand side telescopes to  @xmath80 and the left - hand side turns into a recurrence for the sum in  .",
    "this method is known as creative telescoping .",
    "finally we obtain two annihilating operators  @xmath81 and @xmath82 for the left - hand side of  .    for the right - hand side of",
    ", we can again construct an ideal of recurrences from the defining equations of  @xmath24 .",
    "it turns out that this ideal contains @xmath81 and  @xmath82 , so that both sides of are annihilated by these two operators .",
    "additionally , @xmath81 and @xmath82 have been constructed such that they require only finitely many initial values to produce a uniquely determined bivariate sequence .",
    "therefore it suffices to check that the two sides of agree at some finitely many points @xmath38 .      to certify the final identity , we rewrite equivalently into @xmath83 where @xmath84 denotes the @xmath0-pochhammer symbol . as before , we use creative telescoping to provide a certified operator  @xmath85 which annihilates the sum on the left - hand side .",
    "in the present case , a single operator is sufficient because the sum depends only on a single variable  @xmath18 ( there is no  @xmath86 there ) . using the operator  @xmath85 and the defining equations for  @xmath24",
    ", we then construct a recurrence for the entire left - hand side , which turns out to have order twelve . as",
    "this recurrence is a left multiple of the second order operator annihilating the right - hand side , the proof of theorem  [ qtsppthm ] is completed by checking   for @xmath87 .",

    "kurt gdel , on the other hand , meta - proved that there exist many short statements whose shortest possible proof is very long .",
