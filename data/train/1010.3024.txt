    "<S> we study the pseudogap bose - fermi anderson model with a continuous - time quantum monte carlo ( ct - qmc ) method . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss some delicate aspects of the transformation from this model to the bose - fermi kondo model . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the ct - qmc method can be used at sufficiently low temperatures to access the quantum critical properties of these models .    over the past decade </S>",
    "<S> intermetallic compounds have served as model systems to study instabilities of metallic magnets near zero temperature  @xcite . in particular </S>",
    "<S> the quantum critical properties found in several heavy fermion compounds seem to be beyond the ginzburg - landau paradigm of criticality  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a natural explanation for the new type of criticality invokes inherently - quantum critical modes in addition to the gapless order parameter fluctuations . in the case of heavy fermion compounds , </S>",
    "<S> the additional critical mode has been identified with the destruction of the kondo effect  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the destruction of the kondo effect is local in space it can be systematically studied in simplified , local models . in these quantum impurity systems </S>",
    "<S> the critical state only appears at the ( spatial ) boundary of suitable hosts .    in the present article </S>",
    "<S> , we study the kondo - destroying quantum critical point in the pseudogap bose - fermi kondo model ( pbfkm ) with ising anisotropy , defined as @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 are the fermonic and bosonic bath dispersions , @xmath3 is the kondo coupling between the spin of the conduction electrons and the spin of the impurity , @xmath4 is a vector of pauli spin matrices and @xmath5 is the coupling between the @xmath6-component of the impurity spin and the bosonic bath . </S>",
    "<S> we take a pseudogap density of states ( dos ) for the conduction electrons , @xmath7 for @xmath8 and @xmath9 where we have taken the fermi energy to be zero , and a sub - ohmic density of states for the bosons , @xmath10\\propto \\mathrm{sgn}(\\omega)|\\omega|^{\\alpha}$ ] up to a cutoff @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> a perturbative renormalization group study has been used carried out for the bose - fermi kondo model with non - zero conduction - electron dos ( @xmath12 ) in both the ising and continuous spin symmetry cases @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for the pseudogapped case ( @xmath13 ) , such a study has been possible only for the continuous spin symmetry case @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical renormalization group method , on the other hand , has been used to study the model in the ising limit @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ pbfkm ] ) has as particular limits the pseudogap kondo and the bose - fermi kondo models , which have recently been studied using related methods  @xcite . despite the seeming simplicity of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : pbfkm ] ) , it is hard to study the quantum critical properties of the pbfkm directly . in particular , the quantum - relaxational regime ( @xmath14 ) is difficult to address theoretically . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum - relaxational regime of the pseudogap kondo model has been studied previously  @xcite , by applying a ct - qmc algorithm  @xcite to the pseudogap anderson model whose low - energy sector in the local moment regime can be mapped onto the pseudogap kondo model via a schrieffer - wolff ( sw ) transformation . since the anderson model only involves fermions , standard perturbative expansion methods can be applied to it . in the ct - qmc approach </S>",
    "<S> , the full perturbative expansion in terms of the hybridization between conduction and localized fermions is then sampled stochastically using a monte carlo algorithm  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding bose - fermi anderson model is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the energy level of the impurity , @xmath17 is the on - site interaction , @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the hybridization of the impurity with the conduction electrons , and @xmath20 . the ct - qmc method has been extended to treat ohmic bosonic baths coupled to the charge of the impurity by invoking a firsov - lang ( fl ) transformation  @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we extend this approach to treat a sub - ohmic bosonic bath that couples to the spin of the impurity and explore the possibility of using it to access the quantum critical properties . as it turns out </S>",
    "<S> , the generators of the fl and sw transformations do not commute , raising the important question as to which is the proper order of applying the two transformations .    </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the particle - hole symmetric case , @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> first , we perform the fl transformation to eliminate the term linear in @xmath22 exactly . </S>",
    "<S> we choose a generator @xmath23 and the transformed hamiltonian @xmath24 is @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 for @xmath28/@xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath32 and the transformation does not destroy particle - hole symmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> a modified sw transformation  @xcite is used to eliminate the hybridization term in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ h_2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we only consider the kondo limit , and for simplicity neglect the @xmath33 dependence of @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the generator @xmath35 is standard but with @xmath36 replaced by @xmath37 , namely @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> writing the hamiltonian in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ h_2 ] ) as @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , we have @xmath43 + \\frac{1}{2}[s_{sw},\\tilde{h}_h]$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> projecting out unoccupied and doubly occupied states we arrive at@xmath44 </S>",
    "<S> where @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the kondo coupling , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 . the third term in equation  ( [ h_sw ] ) </S>",
    "<S> represents a potential scattering of the conduction electrons , and the last is the kondo term , but with renormalized impurity spin flip operators due to the presence of the bosonic bath . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath51 differs from the standard expression in that @xmath17 and @xmath16 is replaced by @xmath52 and @xmath53 .    </S>",
    "<S> we will now discuss the opposite order of transformations , namely , @xmath54 . applying the sw transformation , projecting out charge fluctuations and then applying the fl transformation arrives at equation ( [ h_sw ] ) , however with @xmath55 , @xmath56 replaced by @xmath57 , @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> we see that applying first the sw transformation , which is not exact , completely ignores the bosonic baths influence on the charge degrees of freedom of the impurity . whereas applying the fl transformation first , which is exact , correctly captures the bosonic baths influence on the anderson model which lowers the kondo coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the non - commutativity of the two transformations quantitatively affects the effective kondo scale at the quantum critical point , but it does not change the universal scaling behavior of the quantum critical properties because the critical value of the kondo coupling is not universal .    as a check on the ct - qmc approach we first compare the single particle green function and the spin susceptibility for the numerical result with @xmath59 to the analytic result . for @xmath60 the bosonic bath decouples from the problem and can be ignored , and taking @xmath61 reduces the hamiltonian in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hamiltonian_1 ] ) to the resonant level model with a pseudogap . </S>",
    "<S> the impurity single particle green function , @xmath62 is then @xmath63 . using @xmath34 and taking the infinite bandwidth limit </S>",
    "<S> we can perform the sum over @xmath33  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath64 , where @xmath65 , @xmath66 and we have defined the dynamic hybridization function to be @xmath67 . the imaginary time green function </S>",
    "<S> can then be obtain by fourier transform , @xmath68 and the local spin susceptibility can be constructed @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> as seen in figure  [ fig : figure2 ] we obtain quantitative agreement , within numerical accuracy , in the long time behavior for both @xmath70 and @xmath71 .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to the quantum - critical properties of the pbfkm defined in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hamiltonian_1 ] ) by measuring the static spin susceptibility , described below . </S>",
    "<S> in what follows we fix @xmath72 and @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> after the ( fl ) transformation , the hamiltonian in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ h_2 ] ) can be expanded in the hybridization term . </S>",
    "<S> we use the ct - qmc algorithm to calculate the partition function , the single particle green function and the local spin susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> fixing @xmath74 and varying @xmath5 we can tune the model to a quantum critical point ( qcp ) . within the ct - qmc approach we measure the local spin susceptibility @xmath75 and then calculate the static susceptibility @xmath76 , where we have set the lande g - factor and bohr magneton to unity . for small @xmath5 , </S>",
    "<S> the finite @xmath17 gives rise to a kondo screened local moment ; the static susceptibility approaches a constant for temperatures well below the kondo temperature , @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> for large @xmath5 , the impurity spin decouples from the conduction band and follows the fluctuations of the bosonic bath ; the static susceptibility takes the curie - weiss form , @xmath78 . at the qcp , the bosonic bath acts to decohere and destroy the kondo effect @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , at the qcp the scaling of @xmath79 acquires an anomalous exponent @xmath80 for temperatures well below @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> as seen in figure  [ fig : figure1 ] , using the ct - qmc approach we obtain @xmath81 and in the vicinity of the quantum critical point , @xmath82 with @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> our calculated exponent agrees with the numerical renormalization group result within numerical accuracy  @xcite ; the same exponent is also expected in related pseudogap bose - fermi kondo model with continuous spin symmetry @xcite or the bose - fermi kondo model with ising symmetry but with @xmath12 @xcite .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the low energy properties of the pseudogap bose - fermi kondo model can be addressed within a continuous - time quantum monte carlo approach . </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated that this approach correctly reproduces the exactly solvable limit of the pseudogap resonant level model , and been able to determine the critical behavior of the static local spin susceptibility in an interacting case .    </S>",
