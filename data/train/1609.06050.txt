    "there has been significant recent work on vlasov - maxwell ( vm ) equilibria that are consistent with nonlinear force - free @xcite and ` nearly force - free ' @xcite magnetic fields in cartesian geometry .",
    "therein , force - free refers to a magnetic field for which the associated current density is exactly parallel , which is the definition we shall also use , @xmath0 these works consider one - dimensional ( 1d ) collisionless current sheets , with refs . specifically calculating vm equilibrium distribution functions ( dfs ) that are self - consistent with a given specific magnetic field configuration .",
    "a natural question to consider is whether it is also possible to find self - consistent force - free ( or nearly force - free ) vm equilibria for other geometries , in particular cylindrical geometry . in this paper",
    "we shall present particular vm equilibria for 1d magnetic fields which are nearly force - free in cylindrical geometry , i.e. flux tubes / ropes    two of the archetypal field configurations in cylindrical geometry are the @xmath1-pinch ( with axial current and azimuthal magnetic field ) , a classical example of which is the bennett pinch@xcite ; and the @xmath2-pinch ( azimuthal current and axial magnetic field ) .",
    "consideration of ` vlasov - fluid ' models of @xmath1-pinch equilibria was given in ref .",
    ", with ref .",
    "calculating @xmath1-pinch equilibria and an extension with azimuthal ion - currents .",
    "others have also constructed kinetic models of the @xmath2-pinch , see refs . for examples . in the same year as pfirsch @xcite , cylindrical kinetic equilibria with only azimuthal current",
    "were studied in ref . .",
    "for examples of treatments of the stability of fluid and kinetic linear pinches , see refs respectively .",
    "recently there have been studies on ` tokamak - like ' vm equilibria with flows @xcite , starting from the vm equation in cylindrical geometry and working towards grad - shafranov equations for the vector potential .",
    "we also note two vlasov equilibrium dfs in the literature that are close in style to the one that we shall present .",
    "the first is described in a brief paper @xcite , with an equilibrium presented for a cylindrical pinch .",
    "however , their distribution describes a different magnetic field and the df appears not to be positive over all phase space .",
    "the second df is a very recent paper @xcite that actually describes a magnetic field much like the one that we discuss .",
    "their df is designed to model ` ion - scale ' flux tubes in the earth s magnetosphere .",
    "formally , their quasineutral model approaches a nonlinear force - free configuration in the limit of a vanishing electron to ion mass ratio . in their model ,",
    "current is carried exclusively by electrons and the non - negativity of the df depends on a suitable choice of microscopic parameters .",
    "finally , we mention that in beam physics , much work on constructing cylindrical vm equilibria is done by looking for mono - energetic distributions with conserved angular momentum , see refs . for some examples .",
    "magnetic flux tubes and flux ropes are prevelant in the study of plasmas , with a wide variety of observed forms in nature and experiment , as well as uses and applications in numerical experiments and theory . some examples of the environments and fields of study in which they feature include solar @xcite ; solar wind @xcite ; planetary magnetospheres @xcite and magnetopauses @xcite ; astrophysical plasmas @xcite ; tokamak @xcite , laboratory pinch experiments @xcite and the basic study of energy release in magnetised plasmas @xcite , to give a small selection of references .",
    "one application of flux tubes is in the study of solar active regions @xcite and the onset of solar flares and coronal mass ejections @xcite . a classic magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) model for magnetic flux tubes",
    "was first presented by t. gold and f. hoyle ( gh ) @xcite , initially intended for use in the study of solar flares .",
    "the gh model is an infinite , straight , 1d and nonlinear force - free magnetic flux tube with constant ` twist'@xcite .",
    "mathematically , the gh magnetic field could be regarded as the cylindrical analogue@xcite of the force - free harris sheet@xcite ( a planar current sheet model ) , as the bennett pinch @xcite might be to the ` original ' harris sheet @xcite .",
    "it is typical to consider solar , space and astrophysical flux tubes within the framework of mhd , e.g. see ref . .",
    "however , many of these plasmas can be weakly collisional or collisionless , with values of the collisional free path large against any fluid scale @xcite , making a description using collisionless kinetic theory necessary .",
    "it is the intention of this paper to study the gh flux tube model beyond the mhd description , since - apart from the very recent work in ref .",
    "- we see no attempt in the literature of a microscopic description of the gh field .",
    "other than any interesting theoretical advances , a possible application of the results of this study could be to implement the obtained model in kinetic ( particle ) numerical simulations .    in cartesian geometry , the work in refs .",
    "used the method proposed by channell@xcite to tackle the vm inverse problem , i.e. to determine self - consistent equilibrium dfs for a given magnetic field configuration .",
    "channell described the extension of his work to cylindrical geometry as ` not possible in a straightforward manner . ' as explained in ref .",
    "( in which cylindrical coordinates are used to model a torus ) , this is due in part to the ` toroidicity ' of the problem , i.e. the @xmath3 factor in the equations . as we shall see in this paper",
    ", another potential complication is the need to allow  at least in principle  a non - zero charge density .",
    "the work in this paper does not present a generalised method for the vm inverse problem in cylindrical geometry , but instead some particular solutions for a specific given magnetic field .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    "we first review the theory of the equation of motion consistent with a collisionless df in cylindrical geometry , and discuss the question of the possibility of 1d force - free equilibria .",
    "then we introduce the magnetic field to be used .",
    "we note that whilst the work in this paper is applied to a particular magnetic field from subsection 2.1 onwards , the steps taken to calculate the equilibrium df seem as though they could be adaptable to other cases . in section 3",
    "we present the form of the df that gives the required macroscopic equilibrium , and proceed to ` fix ' the parameters of the df by explicitly solving ampre s law and poisson s equation .",
    "note that whilst we choose to consider a two - species plasma of ions and electrons , we see no obvious reason preventing the work in this paper being used to describe plasmas with a different composition . in section 4 .",
    "we present a preliminary analysis of the physical properties of the equilibrium .",
    "particularly technical calculations are in the appendices .",
    "appendix a contains the zeroth and first order moment calculations , used to find the number densities and bulk flows directly , and in turn the charge and current densities .",
    "appendix b contains the mathematical details of the existence and location of multiple maxima of the df in velocity - space .",
    "a collisionless equilibrium is characterised by the 1-particle distribution function , @xmath4 , a solution of the steady - state vlasov equation ( e.g. see ref . ) .",
    "the vlasov equation in cylindrical coordinates is @xmath5=0,\\label{eq : vlasov}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] see for example refs . .",
    "here @xmath6 and @xmath7 are used as ` spatial ' indices running over @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is used as the particle species index .",
    "individual particle positions and velocities are given by @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively , for @xmath12 the horizontal distance from the @xmath1 axis , and @xmath2 the azimuthal angle .",
    "the totally antisymmetric unit tensor of rank 3 ( the levi - civita tensor ) is @xmath13 , and the einstein summation convention is applied ( such that repeated indices are summed over , with subscript and superscript indices used to describe co- and contravariant components respectively .",
    "the mass and charge of particle species @xmath9 are @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively .",
    "the electric and magnetic fields are defined as @xmath16 and @xmath17 , for @xmath18 the scalar potential and vector potential @xmath19 .",
    "the ` fluid ' equation of motion of a particular species @xmath9 is found by taking first - order velocity moments of the vlasov equation .    after a routine but laborious moment - taking calculation",
    ", we see that - in equilibrium ( @xmath20 ) , assuming a one - dimensional configuration with only radial dependence ( @xmath21 , and letting @xmath4 be an even function of the radial velocity @xmath22 - force balance for species @xmath9 is maintained according to @xmath23 the pressure tensor for species @xmath9 is a rank-2 tensor and is defined by @xmath24 where @xmath25 , for @xmath26 the bulk velocity of species @xmath9 and @xmath27 the individual particle velocity .",
    "note that the assumption of @xmath28 to be an even function of @xmath29 automatically implies that @xmath30 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : species ] ) can be summed over species to give @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the force density associated with the rotating bulk flows of the ions and electrons .",
    "equation ( [ eq : cmhde_alt ] ) is a cylindrical analogue of the force balance equation in cartesian geometry ( e.g. see ) .",
    "there are ` extra inertial terms ' as compared to the case of cartesian geometry . from the point of view of a particular magnetic field @xmath33 ( which is the point we take by specifying a particular macroscopic equilibrium )",
    ", we see that equilibrium is maintained by a combination of density / pressure variations as in the case of cartesian geometry , but with additional contributions from centrifugal forces and as an inevitable result of the resultant charge separation , an electric field .",
    "this clearly demonstrates that ` sourcing ' an exactly force - free macroscopic equilibrium with an equilibrium df in a 1d cylindrical geometry is inherently a more difficult task than in the cartesian case .",
    "the presence of ` extra ' positive definite inertial forces and , almost inevitably , forces associated with charge separation raises the question of whether exactly force - free equilibria are possible at all in this paradigm .    before proceeding ,",
    "we comment that given certain macroscopic constraints on the electromagnetic fields or fluid quantities - such as the force - free condition , or a specific given magnetic field ( for example ) - it is not _ a priori _ known how to calculate a self - consistent vlasov equilibrium , or if one even exists within the framework of the assumptions made .",
    "hence one has to proceed more or less on a case by case basis , with the intention of achieving consistency with the required macroscopic conditions , upon taking moments of the df .      in refs .",
    "for example , a method used to calculate a df , given a prescribed 1d magnetic field was inverse fourier transforms ( ift ) .",
    "a distribution function of the form @xmath34 was used , with @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 the conserved particle hamiltonian and canonical momenta in the @xmath38 and @xmath39 directions , and @xmath40 an unknown function , to be determined . since",
    "our problem is one of a 1d equilibrium with variation in the radial direction , the three constants of motion are the hamiltonian , and the canonical momenta in the @xmath2 and @xmath1 directions : @xmath41 a function of a subset of the constants of motion is automatically a solution of the vm equation ( e.g. see ref . ) .",
    "one can try to calculate an equilibrium distribution for the gold - hoyle force - free flux tube without a background field by a similar method , assuming a df of the form @xmath42 by exploiting the convolution in the definition of the current density ,",
    "@xmath43 ampre s law can be solved by ift , with the quantity @xmath44 defined by @xmath45 notice how when written in this integral form , @xmath46 is not only a function of @xmath47 , but - in contrast with the cartesian case - also of the relevant spatial co - ordinate , @xmath12 . in the case of zero scalar potential ,",
    "the result of the calculation is to give a distribution function that is not a solution of the vlasov equation as it is not a function of the constants of motion only .",
    "in essence , an additional @xmath48 factor is required in the df to counter @xmath49 terms that manifest by completing the square in the integration .",
    "the physical cause here would appear to be the inertial forces associated with the rotational bulk flow .",
    "if one assumes a non - zero scalar potential , then it seems impossible to satisfy ampre s law .",
    "the physical cause seems to be that , in the case of force - free fields , one would require a ` different ' electrostatic potential to balance the inertial forces for the ions and electrons , which is of course nonsensical .",
    "thus , our investigation seems to suggest that it is not possible to calculate a df of the form of equation ( [ eq : fansatz ] ) for the exact gh field .      to make progress",
    ", we introduce a background field in the negative @xmath1 direction .",
    "the mathematical motivation for this change is to balance the ` @xmath49 problem ' .",
    "physically , it seems that the background field introduces an extra term ( whose sign depends on species ) into the force - balance , to allow for both the ion and electrons to be in force balance simultaneously , given one unique expression for the scalar potential .",
    "the vector potential , magnetic field and current density used in this paper are as follows ( gh+b ) : @xmath50 the magnetic permeability _ in vacuo _ is given by @xmath51 and the characteristic magnetic field strength by @xmath52 .",
    "the constant @xmath53 has units of inverse length , and we use @xmath54 to represent the characteristic length scale of the system ( @xmath55 ) ( see table 1 for a concise list of the dimensionless quantities used in this paper , all denoted with a tilde , @xmath56 )",
    ". the dimensionless constant @xmath57 controls the strength of the background field in the @xmath1 direction , and as a result there are now two different interpretations to be made .",
    "we could either consider the system as a gh flux tube of uniform twist embedded in an untwisted uniform background field , or consider the whole gh+b magnetic field as a non - uniformly twisted flux tube .",
    "we note that flux tubes embedded in an axially directed background field have recently been observed during reconnection events in the earth s magnetotail , by the cluster spacecraft @xcite .    in the first interpretation",
    ", @xmath53 is a direct measure of the ` twist ' of the embedded flux tube ( see ref . ) , with the number of turns per unit length ( in @xmath1 ) along a field line given by @xmath58 @xcite . in the second interpretation",
    ", we see that the system is not uniformly twisted , with the @xmath1 distance traversed when following a field line ( e.g. ) given by @xmath59 the fact that this depends on @xmath12 demonstrates that the system as a whole has non - uniform twist .",
    "the number of turns per unit length in @xmath1 of the gh+b field : the ` twist ' is given by @xmath60 and is plotted in figure [ fig : twist ] for three values of @xmath7 .",
    "since @xmath61 corresponds to the field - reversal regime , we see a mixture of positive and negative twists ( figure [ fig : twist1 ] ) .",
    "however , for @xmath62 we see only negative values of the twist ( figures [ fig : twist2 ] and [ fig : twist3 ] ) , i.e. we travel in the negative @xmath1 direction as we wind round the gh+b flux tube in the anti - clockwise direction .",
    "the magnetic field is plotted in figures [ fig:0.3]-[fig:0.5 ] for two values of @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath63 case contains a reversal of the @xmath64 field direction and as such is akin to a reversed field pinch ( e.g. see ref . for a laboratory interpretation ) : this configuration may be of use in the study of astrophysical jets , see ref .",
    "for example .",
    "the value @xmath65 gives zero @xmath64 at @xmath66 , and as such is the value that distinguishes the two different classes of field configuration , namely unidirectional ( @xmath62 ) or including field reversal ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath67 for which the @xmath64 field reverses is plotted in figure [ fig : rev ] .",
    "the magnitude of the gh+b magnetic field is plotted in figure [ fig : bmag ] for three values of @xmath7 .",
    "for all values of @xmath7 , @xmath68 for large @xmath67 , i.e. to a potential field .",
    "the primary task of this paper is to calculate self - consistent collisionless equilibrium distribution functions for the gh+b field .",
    "this problem essentially reduces to solving ampre s law such that equation ( [ eq : vlasov ] ) is satisfied .",
    "we assume nothing about the electric field however , and in fact use that degree of freedom to solve ampre s law .",
    "the resultant form of the scalar potential is then substituted into poisson s equation , to establish the final relationships between the microscopic and macroscopic parameters of the equilibrium .",
    "although the ift method did not yield a self - consistent equilibrium df for the gh field without a background field , the outcome of the calculation can still be used as an indication of possible forms for the df for the gh+b field . using trial and error we arrived at the distribution function @xmath69,\\label{eq : ansatz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is a superposition of two terms that are consistent macroscopically with a ` rigid - rotor ' ,",
    "@xcite for example . a rigid - rotor is microscopically described by a df of the form @xmath70 ( with @xmath71 in the second term of the df in equation ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) ) .",
    "each @xmath72 term corresponds to an average macroscopic motion of rigid rotation with angular frequency @xmath73 , and rectilinear motion with velocity @xmath74 .",
    "the dimensionless constants @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 are yet to be determined , with @xmath79 for positivity of the distribution .",
    "note that the thermal beta is @xmath80 and @xmath81 is the thermal velocity of species @xmath9 .",
    "the ratio of the thermal larmor radius , @xmath82 ( for @xmath83 ) to the macroscopic length scale of the system @xmath84 , is given by @xmath85 typically known as the ` magnetisation parameter ' @xcite . in our system , the magnitude of the magnetic field and hence @xmath86 itself is spatially variable .",
    "for the purposes of the calculations in this paper however , we set @xmath87 as a characteristic value ( see table [ tab : param ] for a concise list of the micro and macroscopic parameters of the equilibrium ) .      by insisting on a specific magnetic field configuration ( the gh+b field ) we have made a statement on the macroscopic physics . in searching for the equilibrium df",
    ", we are trying to understand the microscopic physics . in this sense",
    "we are tackling an ` inverse problem ' .",
    "once an assumption on the form of the df is made then  should the assumed form be able to reproduce the correct moments  this inverse problem reduces to establishing the relationships between the microscopic and macroscopic parameters of the equilibrium . in this section",
    "we ` fix ' the free parameters of the df in equation ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) , such that maxwell s equations are satisfied ; @xmath88 note that the solenoidal constraint and faraday s law are automatically satisfied for the gh+b field in equilibrium , since @xmath17 implies that @xmath89 and @xmath16 implies that @xmath90 .      in appendix [ app :",
    "moments ] we have calculated the @xmath91 current density , found by summing first order moments in @xmath92 of the df .",
    "we now substitute in the macroscopic expressions for @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 from ( [ eq : current ] ) and ( [ eq : vecfield ] ) into the expression for the @xmath96 current density of equation ( [ eq : jzapp ] ) . after this substitution",
    ", we can calculate a @xmath97 that makes the system consistent .",
    "the substitution of the known expressions for @xmath91 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 gives    @xmath100    in order to satisfy the above equality we can construct a solution by introducing a ` separation constant ' @xmath101 .",
    "we multiply the above equation by @xmath102 which makes the left - hand side constant , whilst the right - hand side is a sum of two terms , one depending on ion parameters and the second depending on electron parameters",
    ". then we can define @xmath103 by @xmath104 associating the ` ion term ' with the first term on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : a1a2 ] ) , and the ` electron term ' with the second term on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : a1a2 ] ) .",
    "after some algebra we can rearrange these two associations to give two expressions for the scalar potential , one in terms of the ion parameters , and one in terms of the electron parameters : @xmath105\\right\\}\\nonumber\\\\",

    "given enough freedom in parameter space , we could say that the @xmath1 component of ampre s law is _ implicitly _ solved the above equations , in that one just needs to choose a consistent set of parameters .",
    "however , we seek a solution in an _ explicit _ sense .    in order to make progress we non - dimensionalise the above equations by multiplying both sides by @xmath106 with @xmath107 once this",
    "is done we can write the scalar potential in the form @xmath108^{\\frac{e\\beta_r}{q_i\\beta_i}}\\right\\},\\label{eq : phi3}\\\\ e\\beta_r\\phi(r)&=&\\ln\\left\\{\\left[\\text{electron terms}\\right]^{\\frac{e\\beta_r}{q_e\\beta_e}}\\right\\}.\\label{eq : phi4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] specifically , equations ( [ eq : phi3 ] ) and ( [ eq : phi4 ] ) require the equality of the arguments of the logarithm to hold in order for a meaningful solution to be obtained for the scalar potential .",
    "a first step towards this is made by requiring consistent powers of the @xmath109 ` profile ' in the right - hand side of the above expression to allow factorisation .",
    "hence @xmath110 and hence the rigid - rotation , @xmath75 , is fixed by the difference of the rectilinear motion , @xmath111 . on top of this , we require that the power of the @xmath109 ` profile ' on the right - hand side is the same for both the ions and electrons , thus @xmath112 this condition seems to be a statement on an average potential energy associated with the particles . once more to allow factorisation of the @xmath109 ` profile ' , we insist that net @xmath113 terms cancel , i.e. @xmath114 the physical meaning of this condition seems to be that the frequencies of the rigid rotor for each species are matched according to the relevant magnetisation , and the background field magnitude .",

    "thus far we have 8 constraints and 12 unknowns ( @xmath116 ) given fixed characteristic macroscopic parameters of the equilibrium @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath7 .",
    "we can now write down an expression for @xmath18 that explicitly solves the @xmath1 component of ampre s law ; @xmath117 with @xmath118 clearly , we require that @xmath119 for the expression above to make sense .",
    "it is clear that the sign of @xmath103 could , in principle , affect the sign of @xmath120 .",

    "thus far we have only considered the @xmath96 component , and it is premature to consider all components of ampre s law satisfied . let us move on to consider the @xmath2 component . in a process similar to that above , we substitute in the macroscopic expressions for @xmath128 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 for the gh+b field into the expression for the @xmath129 current density of equation ( [ eq : jthetageneral ] ) in appendix [ app : moments ] . after this substitution",
    ", we can once more calculate the @xmath18 that makes the system consistent .",
    "the substitution gives @xmath130 using the parameter relations as above , we determine that the scalar potential is again given in the form of ( [ eq : scalarpot ] ) , @xmath131 hence , this form of the scalar potential is consistent provided @xmath132^{\\frac{e\\beta_r}{q_i\\beta_i}}={\\mathcal{d}}=\\left [ -\\frac{1}{\\gamma_2 } \\frac{1}{4\\delta_e}\\frac{n_{0e}m_ev_{th , e}\\omega_e/\\tau}{b_0 ^ 2/(2\\mu_0 )   } e^{{\\tilde{{u}}_{ze}}^2/2 }   \\right]^{\\frac{e\\beta_r}{q_e\\beta_e}}\\label{eq : d2fix}\\ ] ] for @xmath133 another separation constant .",
    "these seem to be conditions on the ratios of the energy densities associated with the bulk rotation and the magnetic field respectively .",
    "this has added two more constraints .",
    "once again we must ensure that @xmath119 .",
    "since @xmath134 , the right - hand side of the above equation implies that @xmath135 to ensure that @xmath119 . whilst the left - hand side implies that @xmath136 for positivity of @xmath120 since @xmath137 .",
    "hence we can say that for positivity @xmath138    we can now consider ampre s law satsified , given a @xmath18 that solves poisson s equation . as a result ,",
    "the problem of consistency is now shifted to solving poisson s equation , where the remaining degrees of freedom lie .",
    "the final step in ` self - consistency ' is to solve poisson s equation .",
    "frequently in such equilibrium studies , this step is replaced by satisfying quasineutrality and in essence solving a first order approximation of poisson s equation , see for example refs . .",
    "here we solve poisson s equation exactly , i.e. to all orders .",
    "poisson s equation in cylindrical coordinates with only radial dependence gives @xmath139 the electric field is calculated as @xmath140 , giving @xmath141 we can now take the divergence of the electric field @xmath142 and so @xmath143 this gives a non - zero net charge per unit length ( in @xmath1 ) of @xmath144 the charge density derived in equation ( [ eq : edivergence ] ) must equal the charge density calculated by taking the zeroth moment of the df .",
    "the expression for the charge density calculated in ( [ eq : sigmaapp ] ) gives @xmath145 the second equality is found by substituting the form of the vector potential from equation ( [ eq : vecfield ] ) , and the final equality is reached by using the conditions derived in equations ( [ eq : omegafix ] ) - ( [ eq : scalarpot ] ) .",
    "we can now match equations ( [ eq : edivergence ] ) and ( [ eq : chargedensity ] ) to get @xmath146 we now have 12 physical parameters ( @xmath147 ) with 11 constraints ( [ eq : omegafix]-[eq : d1fix ] ) , ( [ eq : d2fix ] ) & ( [ eq : poisscon ] ) .",
    "for example , if one picks @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath7 and one microscopic parameter , say @xmath148 , then the remaining parameters of the equilibrium , ( @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 ) , are now determined .",
    "one could of course choose the values of a different set of parameters , and determine those that remain by using the constraints derived .",
    "note that whilst the constants @xmath125 and @xmath152 are system parameters , they are not physically meaningful as they only represent a change in the gauge of the scalar potential .",
    "it is seen from equations ( [ eq : edivergence ] ) and ( [ eq : coulomb ] ) that basic electrostatic properties of the equilibrium described by @xmath4 are encoded in @xmath153 .",
