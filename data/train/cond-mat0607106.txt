    "if macromolecules such as colloids are immersed in a solvent of smaller particles , the difference in size makes it useful to describe this mixture in terms of effective interactions by integrating out the degrees of freedom of the solvent .",
    "the resulting interactions between particles of the remaining larger component are often referred to as depletion interactions .",
    "such depletion forces have been studied in detail both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "most theoretical approaches are based on a brute - force approach in which the solutes are frozen in a given configuration and thereby turned into an external field for the solvent @xcite . from the inhomogeneous structure of the solvent in the external field due to two fixed solute particles",
    "one can calculate the solvent mediated effective force acting on the solutes .",
    "this brute - force approach turns out to be very time consuming because for each separation and orientation , for which one wants to determine the depletion force , the inhomogeneous solvent distribution has to be calculated anew .",
    "the insertion approach to depletion potentials @xcite differs in character in that there only one solute particle is fixed .",
    "the advantage is that the calculation of the solvent density profile in the external field of a single solute is usually much simpler and hence computational less demanding .",
    "the potential of the depletion force can be determined from the solvent density profile close to one solute by inserting the second solute into the system using the potential distribution theorem @xcite . however , for the insertion step a theoretical description of a mixture consisting of solute and solvent particles is required .",
    "so far , most studies of depletion forces have been focused on rather simple geometries , such as the force between a big sphere and a planar wall or between two big spheres in a solvent of small spheres . for these symmetric systems",
    "the depletion potential depends on the sphere - wall or the sphere - sphere separation as the only parameter characterizing the configuration .",
    "in addition , for these geometries the use of the aforementioned insertion approach is facilitated by the availability of reliable density functional theories for hard - sphere mixtures .    in colloidal mixtures one",
    "generally encounters more complex particle shapes both of the solute and solvent particles .",
    "however , the understanding of depletion potentials for non - spherical objects is still rudimentary .",
    "the corresponding calculations are much more challenging because in these cases the depletion potential depends not only on the separation between the solutes but also on their relative orientation .",
    "a first extension beyond the mixture of spheres is the case of spherical solutes immersed in a solvent of non - spherical particles .",
    "depletion agents such as thin rods @xcite or infinitely thin platelets @xcite can generate big depletion effects even at rather low solvent concentrations @xcite .",
    "the depletion potential in these cases can be calculated in the limit of small solvent densities so that correlations among the depletion agents are small .",
    "similar in spirit is also the calculation of the depletion force between spheres in a solvent of a liquid - crystal in its nematic phase @xcite , for which the strong correlations between particles of the liquid crystal are taken into account effectively by reducing their orientational degrees of freedom .",
    "the strength of the depletion interaction is then estimated by excluded volume calculations , following the ideas of asakura and oosawa @xcite .    a second , more complicated situation is the one studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , where one spherocylinder immersed in a spherical solvent close to a planar wall was considered .",
    "these calculations employed the insertion approach .",
    "the resulting depletion potential depends not only on the separation of the solute from the wall but also on its orientation .",
    "hence in addition to the depletion force an entropic torque acts on the solute .",
    "there are recent studies of depletion forces between two spherocylinders in a solvent of spheres which overcome the asakura - oosawa approximation @xcite . using a three - dimensional integral - equation theory ,",
    "kinoshita @xcite showed that the corresponding depletion potential displays a rich behavior and depends sensitively on the path along which the spherocylinders approach each other .",
    "similar findings were reported in a simulation study , in which the depletion potential was determined by the acceptance ratio method @xcite .    here",

    "although our approach is flexible and can treat also soft solvent - solvent and solute - solvent interactions , in the following we shall restrict our considerations to the case of hard - core interactions .",

    "( [ cerho ] ) and ( [ cepsi ] ) are merely approximations of the functions @xmath2 or @xmath49 that take the shape of the external potential into account in an efficient way . within this line of arguments",

    "@xcite we can determine uniquely the coefficient functions @xmath52 for @xmath53 up to third order in the inverse of the radii of curvatures inferred from planar , spherical , and cylindrical geometries . in order to obtain higher order contributions one would have to consider more complex wall shapes .",
    "the numerical accuracy of weighted densities calculated at more complex walls is , however , unsatisfactory and practically prevents a reliable decomposition into coefficient functions . since we are interested in calculating the depletion potential between two _ big _ non - spherical objects immersed in a solvent of _ small _ spheres , the coefficient functions which we have determined are sufficient . for our approach to be quantitatively reliable , curvatures of the surface of the non - spherical objects should always be sufficiently small .",

    "( [ cb1 ] ) the weight functions @xmath66 for a non - spherical object are required . for this problem",

    "entropic torque between two oblate ellipsoids with half - axes @xmath86 immersed in a solvent of hard spheres with radius @xmath10 as sketched in the inset .",
    "the angle @xmath97 parameterizes the rotation of the inserted ellipsoid and @xmath118 denotes the distance between the centers .",
    "the ellipsoids are aligned such that the vector connecting their centers runs through the north poles of the fixed ( lower ) ellipsoid . for this setup",
    "the entropic torque @xmath111 is given by @xmath119 @xcite . if @xmath120 , the inserted ( upper ) ellipsoid can be rotated as indicated in the inset and experiences an entropic torque .",
    "positive values of @xmath111 mean that the ellipsoid is pushed towards larger values of @xmath97 .",
    "the curves end if the two ellipsoids overlap due to the geometrical constraint .",
    "note that the visible discontinuities in the first derivative of the curves for @xmath121 and @xmath122 are not artifacts .",
    "they occur if both ellipsoids come so close that just a single small sphere with radius @xmath10 fits in between their surfaces . for @xmath123",
    "the distance between the ellipsoids is large enough so that this effect does not occur . ]",
    "if for any relative orientation of the ellipsoids the minimal distance between the surfaces equals the diameter @xmath124 of a solvent spheres , the torque exhibits a cusp , as can be seen in the cases of @xmath125 . for @xmath126",
    "this orientation occurs at @xmath98 .",
    "accordingly , for sufficiently large @xmath118 no such cusps occur .    all these feature of the torque ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : oblatetorque ] ) are similar to those of the entropic torque acting on a spherocylinder close to a planar wall @xcite .    from these results",
    ", one can speculate how two freely floating ellipsoids most likely would approach each other .",
    "similar to the case of a spherocylinder close to a planar wall @xcite we find that the ellipsoids prefer to be parallel once they touch each other . this configuration corresponds to @xmath98 in fig .",
    "[ fig : twooblates ] . in order to be able to overcome potential barriers while approaching ,",
    "it is easier for the ellipsoids to approach with a relative orientation different from the parallel configuration . by first seeking contact in regions of high curvature , and then by adapting the orientation such that regions of low curvature get in contact with each other , potential barriers , which have to be overcome , are significantly reduced and the minimum of the depletion potential can be reached .",
    "this interpretation agrees with observations reported in refs .",
    "@xcite where the depletion potential between two spherocylinder was studied .",
    "we have extended our density functional theory approach for calculating depletion potentials @xcite to the effective interactions between generally shaped convex particles with surface curvatures which vary smoothly . as in the previously studied @xcite geometrically simple case of two spherical particles ,",
    "it is most efficient to carry out the calculation in two steps . in the first step",
    "we describe the structure of the solvent close to a fixed object . we have shown that a curvature expansion of the density profile , or equivalently of the derivatives @xmath44 of the free energy density [ eq .  ( [ cepsi ] ) ] provides an efficient tool . by employing the curvature expansion we implicitly assume that the mean and gaussian curvatures of the surface of the solute vary smoothly across its surface .",
    "discontinuities in the curvatures , such as those observed at sharp edges or close to the spherical caps of a spherocylinder can not be captured fully by the curvature expansion in its present form ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : compare ] ) .    in a second step",
    "we insert the second particle into the inhomogeneous solvent . to this end",
    "we employ an extension of fundamental measure theory to non - spherical particles @xcite , which was already used in the study of a spherocylinder close to a planar wall @xcite . using this approach",
    "we have studied the depletion potential between one ellipsoid and a big sphere immersed in a hard - sphere solvent . in this case",
    "we could test the accuracy of our approach by carrying out the calculations in two different ways , which employ the various approximations of our approach independently .",
    "we have found excellent agreement between the two routes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : test ] ) which provides confidence for the scheme used .",
    "furthermore , we have studied the depletion potential between two equally sized oblate ellipsoids . for this case",
    "we have illustrated the potential of our approach . from the resulting depletion potential ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : twooblates ] and [ fig : oblatesangle ] ) one can calculate the entropic force acting on the centers of the solutes as well as the entropic torque ( fig .  [ fig : oblatetorque ] ) .",
    "this provides a picture for the likely pathway of how two freely floating ellipsoids approach each other under the action of entropic forces    besides the application to colloidal mixtures of non - spherical objects and spheres , this approach should prove useful to studying biological inspired model key and lock systems @xcite , for which depletion interactions between non - spherical objects and geometrically structured substrates are considered .",
    "the non - spherical objects and the substrates display a perfect geometrical match , similar to biological macromolecules ( key ) which can form chemical bonds with a cavity ( lock ) only if they are sufficiently close together . the issue is how the key can be guided into the lock using a robust , chemically unspecific mechanism .",
    "our present analysis provides first steps towards addressing this issue .",
