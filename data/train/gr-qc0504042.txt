    "recent targeted searches for gravitational waves from radio pulsars have needed to consider only four signal parameters : @xmath1 , the signal amplitude , @xmath2 , the inclination angle of the pulsar toward the line of sight , @xmath3 , the polarisation angle of the gravitational wave and @xmath4 , the initial phase of the signal . in the absence of a detection , it is possible to set an upper limit on @xmath1 , and therefore on the ellipticity of the pulsar in question .",
    "this is accomplished by defining a bayesian posterior probability density function ( pdf ) of the four signal parameters and marginalising it numerically on a grid . in the time - domain ,",
    "this search technique relies on precise heterodyning of data from the gravitational wave detector , which itself requires accurate information on the phase evolution of the signal . for known pulsars this",
    "is easily obtained by monitoring the timing of their radio wave pulses , which directly provides the frequency and frequency derivatives of the gravitational signal ( emitted at twice the object s rotation frequency ) @xcite . however , there are objects whose frequencies are not known accurately , such as the reported remnant of supernova 1987a @xcite . to perform",
    "a search over a range of frequencies would require a grid on frequency and frequency derivative with resolutions approximately @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively , which makes the number of search templates very large ( @xmath7 for ligo s3 data ) .",
    "we present an adaptation of this search based on a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method which does not require an exhaustive examination of the parameter space and therefore is able to search a range of frequencies in a reasonable time .",
    "after heterodyning at close to the expected signal frequency , the gravitational wave signal from a rotating triaxial neutron star has the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the beam patterns for the @xmath11 and @xmath12 polarisations , and @xmath13 is the phase of the signal given to the first two taylor expansion terms by @xmath14.\\ ] ] here , @xmath15 is the deviation of the signal frequency from the heterodyne frequency , and @xmath16 is the deviation from first derivative of the heterodyne frequency @xcite . by including these two parameters we can search around the heterodyne frequency for a signal .",
    "the heterodyned data is reduced to one complex sample per minute , @xmath17 , with variance @xmath18 , allowing a frequency range of @xmath19$]hz around the heterodyne frequency to be searched .",
    "the search in @xmath16 is limited to @xmath20$]hz / s which is likely to include any possible pulsar spindown rates .",
    "the search proceeds by heterodyning 480 separate frequency bands at intervals of @xmath21hz , and running parallel searches on each band . in this way",
    "we complete a search over a 4hz range ",
    "suitable for the putative sn1987a pulsar .",
    "the probability of a particular combination of the six parameters @xmath22 representing a signal in the data @xmath23 is @xmath24,\\ ] ] which is the prior probability of @xmath22 multiplied by its likelihood .",
    "this proportional definition is adequate for our application , as we will only be evaluating ratios of probabilities .",
    "we now have a joint posterior probability distribution over the six parameters in vector @xmath22 , but in the presence of a signal the probability will be strongly concentrated around the signal parameters .",
    "the markov chain monte carlo method takes advantage of this fact by preferentially sampling the areas of greatest probability density , in proportion to that probability @xcite . in this way we can approximate the posterior distribution @xmath25 by allowing the markov chain to accumulate many samples , where the density of samples in an area is then proportional to the probability density in that area . in order to accomplish this ,",
    "a markov chain in state @xmath26 chooses a candidate sample @xmath27 from proposal distribution @xmath28 , and then accepts the candidate as the next state of the chain with probability @xmath29.\\ ] ] if the proposal is not accepted , the current state @xmath22 is recorded as a sample again and the process repeats .",
    "the proposal distribution @xmath28 is a multivariate normal distribution , with covariances determined by the correlation between parameters in trial runs . in practice ,",
    "the highly correlated parameters @xmath1 and @xmath30 are replaced with a re - parameterisation , such that @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the frequency parameters are also changed to @xmath33 and @xmath34 , being the signal frequency at the start and end times of the data .",
    "it is important that the chain explore the parameter space adequately , in order to find the area of high probability . to this end",
    ", we have included a delayed rejection stage of the algorithm , so that if a proposal @xmath27 is rejected , a new candidate is generated from distribution @xmath35 , which has a narrower width and makes more conservative steps .",
    "these are accepted with probability @xmath36,\\ ] ] where the proposal distributions are included to satisfy the principle of detailed balance .",
    "this allows the chain to make small steps where a large step would be rejected .",
    "in addition to these measures , there is also a burn - in period at the start of each mcmc run where the exponent in eqn .  3",
    "is multiplied by an inverse temperature factor @xmath37 in the proposed step .",
    "initially @xmath38 , and gradually increases during the burn - in period to @xmath39 , where eqn .",
    "3 is restored .",
    "this decreases the likelihood of the chain getting stuck in a local maximum of probability without exploring the space adequately .",
    "no samples from the burn - in period are used in calculating the final pdf , as they do not represent the target distribution @xmath25 . in our implementation",
    "the burn - in lasts for @xmath40 iterations , followed by 100000 iterations with every 50th used as a sample , so as to reduce correlation between samples .",
    "the program is implemented in c , using the ligo algorithm library to calculate the beam patterns and time delays necessary for analysing a real signal @xcite .",
    "in the standard time - domain search , if a signal is not detected it is useful to set an upper limit on gravitational radiation emitted by the source under examination .",
    "this translates as an upper limit on the ellipticity of the pulsar which can be used to constrain physical models of a neutron star .",
    "this is achieved by marginalising the posterior pdf over @xmath30 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , leaving a distribution on @xmath1 which can then be integrated upward from @xmath41 until 95% of the probability is included in the interval .",
    "the upper limit of the interval is then the 95% upper limit on @xmath1 for the target .    in the mcmc",
    "routine however , if the signal is below a certain threshold then the chain may not converge on the correct mode of the signal in the pdf @xcite .",
    "this is partly due to the narrowness of the mode in @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where the bulk of the probability lies within a single frequency bin of width @xmath5 with a very small attraction area .",
    "hz and @xmath42hz / s ( vertical lines ) , and the best normal fits , having standard deviations @xmath43hz and @xmath44hz / s respectively.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0%,height=207 ] hz and @xmath42hz / s ( vertical lines ) , and the best normal fits , having standard deviations @xmath43hz and @xmath44hz / s respectively.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0%,height=207 ]    a weak signal will raise probability only slightly in this bin , so that even if the chain were to find the mode , it has a probability of jumping out and not returning .",
    "these factors therefore preclude the evaluation of an upper limit simply by marginalising the posterior pdf when there is no detection .",
    "instead , we performed a monte carlo simulation by injecting signals of known parameters into noise , and running the mcmc code to try and recover them .",
    "signals are injected with known parameters by calculating the value of the signal at each timestamp @xmath45 using lal and adding it to each sample @xmath17 in the input data file .",
    "real data would have to be heterodyned prior to this step , but the artificial noise is generated at @xmath46hz so heterodyning is unnecessary in the simulations .",
    "it can be shown that the probability of detecting a signal using our method depends strongly on the injected values of @xmath1 and @xmath30 , and much more weakly on the value of @xmath3 . to determine our upper limit for a particular set of data , we inject signals of varying @xmath1 and @xmath30 into the noise @xmath18",
    ", then analyse the results of the mcmc routine to determine if it has detected the signal .",
    "this is accomplished by observing the output pdfs in @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and determining if the chain has converged or not .",
    "if the injected value lies within three standard deviations of the mean , and the standard deviations themselves are less than one frequency bin in size , the chain is judged to have converged .",
    "if the chain has not converged , the samples are distributed widely over the entire @xmath15 range , and the standard deviation is typically five orders of magnitude higher .",
    "1 shows the posterior pdfs in the @xmath15 and @xmath16 parameters for a chain converged on a signal with injected parameters @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51hz and @xmath42 hz / s , where the noise level was @xmath52 .",
    "2 shows the same type of plot for a signal with @xmath53 and otherwise identical parameters ; this chain failed to converge , so there is no concentrated mode in the pdf .",
    "the attempted fit to a normal distribution to test convergence is therefore very wide , and poorly fitted .     and @xmath16 posterior pdfs ( bars ) for a 2000 sample chain which failed to converge on the injected parameters ( vertical lines ) .",
    "this distribution is clearly distinguishable from the converged case using the criteria defined above.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0%,height=207 ]   and @xmath16 posterior pdfs ( bars ) for a 2000 sample chain which failed to converge on the injected parameters ( vertical lines ) .",
    "this distribution is clearly distinguishable from the converged case using the criteria defined above.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0%,height=207 ]    the injections are repeated , using a different starting point in parameter space for the mcmc chain each time , and an empirical probability of signal recovery @xmath54 for each point on the ( @xmath1 , @xmath30 ) plane is obtained from the set of results .",
    "3 shows the result on the ( @xmath1 , @xmath30 ) plane of performing this procedure on 64000 samples of white noise with a variance of @xmath52 .",
    "the dark region shows where no signal is detectable , above which is a small transition zone where there is a finite probability of detection . with increasing iterations of the chain",
    ", the width of this zone reduces - we are using a chain of 1100000 iterations , of which the first 1000000 are burn - in time and the last 100000 used for sampling the pdf .",
    "the white area above this transition zone represents signals that are detected with very high probability .",
    "these are strong enough to cause the chain to converge on them in every instance of the monte carlo simulation .",
    "it is clear from the figure that this is strongly dependent on @xmath30 , as this acts a weighting factor between the power in the real and imaginary parts of the heterodyned signal .",
    "the distribution is symmetric about @xmath48 , so only the positive half was calculated .     and @xmath30 .",
    "this shows the strong dependence on both these parameters .",
    "the transition from detectable to undetectable occurs over a narrow region for a particular value of @xmath30 , but decreases in @xmath1 as @xmath30 tends to 1.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    this result can then be marginalised by summing over @xmath30 and normalising to give a distribution on @xmath1 , as required for an upper limit .",
    "the probability of there being an undetected gravitational wave is then @xmath55 , and the upper limit @xmath56 satisfies @xmath57 .",
    "note that @xmath58 is a probability rather than a probability density .",
    "the upper limit determined from this stage is applicable to each of the 480 bands in the 4hz frequency interval because the values of @xmath18 are determined by estimating the noise over the entire 4hz band at the heterodyne stage .",
    "the heterodyne then performs filtering of this band to calculate the signal @xmath17 in each @xmath46hz interval , from which the 480 bands are derived .     axis .",
    "this shows that the 95% confidence ( represented by the horizontal line ) may be drawn at @xmath59.,width=302 ]    fig .",
    "4 shows this final distribution on @xmath1 , where the horizontal line represents 95% confidence in detection , required for a 95% upper limit , which is achieved at @xmath60 .",
    "it is useful to express this in terms of noise power spectral density , @xmath61 , yielding the relation @xmath62 where the 512.2 is an indicator of the sensitivity of the search , empirically derived from the simulation .    for a realistic example , consider a noise power spectral density of @xmath63 , or @xmath64 , and a data run of 44 days , the upper limit would then be approximately @xmath65",
    "this mcmc search method is capable of reliably detecting a signal above a certain threshold and estimating its parameters including frequency and spindown .",
    "the computing time it takes to perform the search is dependent only on the amount of data and the number of mcmc iterations desired , which provides significant improvement over the previous time - domain targeted search@xcite . with the current version of the pipeline ,",
    "to analyse the entire 4 hz window would take about 17000 cpu hours on a 1.8ghz athlon processor , which is approximately two days on the 366-cpu merlin cluster at aei golm . in the absence of a signal",
    "an upper limit can be set using monte carlo injections , which require a similar amount of processing on top of the search itself .",
    "additional work is under way to tune the algorithm further , which may lead to improvements in sensitivity and speed of execution .",
    "we hope that this technique could be applied to a search for gravitational radiation from possible pulsar in the remnant of sn1987a at @xmath66hz , and in the absence of detection place upper limits on the gravitational radiation emitted by this object if it were triaxial .",
    "the method could also be easily applied to other similar objects .",
