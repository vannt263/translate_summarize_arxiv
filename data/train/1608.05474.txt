    "<S> in iron - based superconductors , a spin - density - wave ( sdw ) magnetic order is suppressed with doping and unconventional superconductivity appears in close proximity to the sdw instability . </S>",
    "<S> the optical response of the sdw order shows clear gap features : substantial suppression in the low - frequency optical conductivity , alongside a spectral weight transfer from low to high frequencies . here </S>",
    "<S> , we study the detailed temperature dependence of the optical response in three different series of the ba122 system [ ba@xmath0k@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2 , ba(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2  and bafe@xmath2(as@xmath0p@xmath1)@xmath2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> intriguingly , we found that the suppression of the low - frequency optical conductivity and spectral weight transfer appear at a temperature @xmath4 much higher than the sdw transition temperature @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> since this behavior has the same optical feature and energy scale as the sdw order , we attribute it to sdw fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , @xmath4 is suppressed with doping , closely following the doping dependence of the nematic fluctuations detected by other techniques . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest that the magnetic and nematic orders have an intimate relationship , in favor of the magnetic - fluctuation - driven nematicity scenario in iron - based superconductors .    </S>",
    "<S> iron - based superconductors ( fescs ) feature complex phase diagrams with multiple phase transitions , including unconventional superconductivity , magnetic and nematic phases . </S>",
    "<S> unconventional superconductivity always appears in the vicinity of other competing phases .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in fescs , the main competing phases are the sdw magnetic and nematic orders . by applying carrier doping , isovalent substitution , or pressure , the sdw and nematic orders are suppressed and unconventional superconductivity emerges .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    in fescs , the competing phases usually consist of various symmetry - breaking orders , which interact with superconductivity in a complicated way .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the sdw magnetic order is of the stripe type ( spins aligned ferromagnetically in one direction and antiferromagnetically in the other ) .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite such an order breaks the @xmath6 spin - rotational symmetry .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the nematic order breaks the @xmath7 symmetry , which is characterized by inequivalent @xmath8 and @xmath9 lattice parameters and anisotropic electronic properties .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the nematic order often occurs either simultaneously or slightly above the sdw transition , making these two orders track each other closely . at present , there are two scenarios for the development of nematic order and its relation to sdw magnetic order . </S>",
    "<S> one scenario is that nematic order is driven by orbital ordering of the iron @xmath10 electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the orbital fluctuations trigger the magnetic transition and induce the striped sdw order .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite another scenario is that the nematic order is driven by magnetic fluctuations , which produce a spin - nematic phase associated with the fact that the striped sdw order can be along either @xmath8 or @xmath9 axis .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite however , it is not easy to assess the relative importance of orbital fluctuations and spin fluctuations from measurable quantities , making the origin of nematicity remain a controversial issue .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it is known that the superconducting order parameter due to spin fluctuations has @xmath11 symmetry ,  @xcite whereas the one due to orbital fluctuations has @xmath12 symmetry .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite therefore , to understand the unconventional superconductivity in fescs , it is important to investigate these competing orders , as well as corresponding fluctuations , since the unconventional superconductivity may be driven by these fluctuations .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite        optical spectroscopy probes the charge dynamics in solid materials , providing important information about phase transitions . </S>",
    "<S> the optical response of the sdw and sc transitions in fescs has been studied by many previous works ,  @xcite where clear gap features have been identified . however </S>",
    "<S> , optical investigations into these materials with detailed temperature and doping dependence across the sdw or nematic transitions are still lacking , since a large amount of measurements are required . here </S>",
    "<S> , we fill this gap by presenting a systematic optical study on a series of high quality k- , co- , and p - doped ba122 single crystals . </S>",
    "<S> we observed strong sdw fluctuations above the sdw transition temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the onset sdw fluctuations temperature @xmath4 is defined by tracking the temperature evolution of the reflectivity and spectral weight . by plotting @xmath4 in the phase diagrams </S>",
    "<S> , we find that it is in good agreement with the doping dependence of nematic fluctuations reported by previous works ,  @xcite suggesting a close connection between the magnetic and nematic orders .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we study three series of ba122 fescs , including ba@xmath0k@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2  ( ref .  ) , ba(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2  ( ref .  ) , and bafe@xmath2(as@xmath0p@xmath1)@xmath2  ( ref .  ) . for each series </S>",

    "<S> an _ in situ _ gold overfilling technique  @xcite was used to obtain the absolute reflectivity of the samples . </S>",
    "<S> data from 30 to @xmath16 were collected at different temperatures on freshly cleaved surface for each sample , and then we extended the reflectivity to @xmath17 at room temperature with an avaspec-2048 @xmath18 14 optical fiber spectrometer . </S>",
    "<S> the optical conductivity , @xmath19 , was obtained by kramers - kronig analysis of the reflectivity . at low frequencies , we employed a hagen - rubens ( @xmath20 ) or a superconducting ( @xmath21 ) extrapolation . above @xmath16 , for all temperatures </S>",

    "<S> we start with our data analysis in the hole - doped compounds ba@xmath0k@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2 . in this system , </S>",
    "<S> the optical response is expected to exhibit distinct changes at each phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig1 ] shows @xmath15 in panels ( a  d ) and @xmath24 in panels ( e  h ) for ba@xmath0k@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2  at different temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> generally , the normal state ( @xmath25 ) optical spectra exhibit typical metallic response , realized by the relatively high @xmath15 and the drude - like behavior in @xmath24 . as the temperature is lower , @xmath15 increases continuously , but is suppressed in the frequency range of 200900@xmath26  for @xmath27 in bfa and bk16 . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , the corresponding @xmath19 is also severely suppressed and most of spectral weight below @xmath28  600@xmath26  is transferred to higher - energy region forming a peak around 900@xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> this spectral evolution manifests the behavior of the sdw gap on the fermi surface .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite upon entering the superconducting state , the low - frequency @xmath15 develops a sharp edge and rises to a flat 100% value , as shown by the 5  k data for bk27 and bk40 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a signature of the superconducting gap . in bk27 and bk40 , @xmath19 at 5  k drops to zero at low frequencies , indicating a fully open superconducting gap .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    in addition to these distinct spectral signatures associated with the sdw and superconducting gaps , we observe an anomalous behavior . as indicated by the orange filled area in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a  c ) , above @xmath5 , a small suppression of @xmath15 sets in between @xmath28  300 and 800@xmath26 , which falls into the energy scale of the sdw gap . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior can also be recognized on @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , in bfa [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](e ) ] , @xmath19 decreases continuously from 300 to 200  k in the grey filled region ( @xmath28  6001200@xmath26 ) , owing to the narrowing of the drude peak . </S>",
    "<S> however , we note that at 150  k the value of @xmath19 becomes slightly higher than that at 200  k. this is explicit evidence of the spectral weight transfer from low to high frequencies above @xmath5 . with more doping , this behavior becomes weaker in bk27 , and finally disappears in the optimally - doped compound bk40 above the sc transition .        in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we determine the onset temperature of the anomalous behavior observed above @xmath5 . one convenient way is to track the temperature dependence of @xmath15 at a certain frequency in the suppressed region . here , we take the value of @xmath15 at 500@xmath26 , @xmath29 , and plot it as a function of temperature for each doping [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a  g ) ] . in the parent compound bfa , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a ) , @xmath29 increases as the temperature is reduced , which is expected for a metallic behavior . </S>",
    "<S> in sharp contrast , @xmath29 begins to decrease at a temperature @xmath30 ( indicated by the red arrow at @xmath31 185  k ) . </S>",
    "<S> below @xmath5 ( indicated by the blue arrow ) , @xmath29 exhibits a more dramatic drop due to the opening of the sdw gap . </S>",
    "<S> in other samples , similar behavior is revealed , allowing the determination of the onset temperature @xmath4 for each doping . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is worth pointing out that @xmath29 does not show any anomaly above @xmath14 in bk40 , implying that this behavior is absent .    </S>",
    "<S> anomalies at @xmath4 can also be verified by a spectral weight analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral weight is defined as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the lower and upper cutoff frequency , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](h  n ) depict the spectral weight between 7001100@xmath26 , @xmath35 , for each doping . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath35 decreases continuously upon cooling due to the narrowing of the drude peak , but starts to increase at @xmath4 signaling the onset of the anomalous spectral weight transfer from low to high frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> below @xmath5 , the increase of @xmath35 becomes more substantial , which is caused the opening of the sdw gap . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] , we summarize the doping evolution of @xmath4 ( red crosses ) in the phase diagram of ba@xmath0k@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2 : with increasing k concentration , @xmath4 is suppressed and terminates on the border of the sdw phase .    in order to confirm whether these observations are common in all ba122 compounds , it is instructive to look into the electron - doped ba(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2  and isovalent - doped bafe@xmath2(as@xmath0p@xmath1)@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig4 ] manifests that these two series show identical optical response above the sdw transition . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4 is also extracted from the temperature dependence of @xmath15 and spectral weight . the phase diagrams in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](u ) and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](v ) summarized the doping evolution of @xmath4 in ba(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2  and bafe@xmath2(as@xmath0p@xmath1)@xmath2 , respectively . in both series </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath4 is suppressed with increasing doping , following the trend of the sdw order . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , @xmath4 survives up to the optimal doping in ba(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 , and the overdoping in bafe@xmath2(as@xmath0p@xmath1)@xmath2 .    based on the above optical results in all three series of the ba122 system , we summarize our new findings : ( i ) the onset temperature ( @xmath4 ) of the low - frequency @xmath24 suppression and spectral weight transfer is above the sdw transition ; ( ii ) the optical response and energy scale of the above anomalous behavior are the same as the sdw gap ; ( iii ) the doping evolution of @xmath4 is similar to the sdw order ; ( iv ) @xmath4 disappears in the underdoped region for ba@xmath0k@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2 , while it survives up to the optimally - doped and overdoped region in ba(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2  and bafe@xmath2(as@xmath0p@xmath1)@xmath2 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these facts suggest that the phenomenon we observed is likely to arise from sdw fluctuations , and these fluctuations span different regions of the phase diagram for different doping types .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    having attributed the observed anomalous behavior to sdw fluctuations , we now discuss its relation to nematicity in these compounds . in fescs , </S>",
    "<S> the electronic nematicity is characterized by anisotropic properties along the @xmath8 and @xmath9 axis .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in the sdw state , anisotropic energy gap and density of states have been revealed by previous theoretical work .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the @xmath36 orbital has fewer electronic states at the fermi level than the @xmath37 orbital . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the optical response of the sdw order is affected by these anisotropic electronic states . in the detwinned co - doped ba122 fescs , anisotropic optical properties have been experimentally observed below and slightly above the sdw transition temperature .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite although optical measurement on twinned crystals is not sensitive to the nematic order or fluctuations , we found that , as shown by the phase diagrams in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] , [ fig4](u ) and [ fig4](v ) , @xmath4 follows the reported doping dependence of nematic fluctuations  @xcite ( yellow areas ) quite well in all three series . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that sdw fluctuations and the nematicity are closed tied to each other . </S>",
    "<S> more interestingly , in ba@xmath0k@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2 , where sdw fluctuations vanish in the underdoped region , nematic fluctuations disappear at approximately the same doping , while in bafe@xmath2(as@xmath0p@xmath1)@xmath2 , where sdw fluctuations exist up to the overdoped region , nematic fluctuations persist to the overdoped regime . </S>",
    "<S> these observations indicate that the sdw and nematic fluctuations are governed by the same physics in all three series , which is in favor of the spin - fluctuation - driven nematicity scenario .    </S>",
    "<S> the distinct doping dependence of @xmath4 in ba@xmath0k@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2 , ba(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2  and bafe@xmath2(as@xmath0p@xmath1)@xmath2  may result from the complicated interaction between magnetism , nematicity and superconductivity , which depends on doping types . </S>",
    "<S> recently , in the hole - doped ba122 fescs , a @xmath7-symmetric magnetic phase has been revealed by the neutron scattering and thermodynamic experiments .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite this @xmath7 magnetic phase exists at the boundary between the superconductivity and sdw magnetic order in the phase diagram , reflecting the strong competition between the magnetism , nematicity and superconductivity . in ba@xmath0k@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2 , </S>",
    "<S> the termination of the nematic fluctuations in the underdoped regime is likely a direct result of the existence of this @xmath7 state . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4 also disappears at the same doping where the nematic order vanishes , suggesting the intimate relation between nematicity and sdw magnetism .    to summarize , we performed systematic optical studies on three series of ba122 single crystals , including ba@xmath0k@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2 , ba(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2  and bafe@xmath2(as@xmath0p@xmath1)@xmath2 . in the underdoped regime , optical evidence for strong sdw fluctuations has been revealed . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath13 approaches the optimal doping , this behavior disappears in the k - doped compounds and becomes weaker in the co- and p - doped compounds . by examining the doping evolution of the onset temperature of the sdw fluctuations , we found it agrees very well with the doping dependence of nematic fluctuations measured by other techniques . </S>",
    "<S> our observations point to an intimate relationship between magnetic fluctuations and nematicity , supporting the spin - fluctuation - driven namaticity scenario .  </S>",
