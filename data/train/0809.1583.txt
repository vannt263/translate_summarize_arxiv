    "after thirty years of experimental and theoretical effort , the mechanism of superconductivity ( sc ) in the organic charge - transfer solids ( cts ) is still elusive .",
    "electron - electron ( e - e ) interactions , electron - phonon ( e - p ) interactions , and lattice frustration all play key roles in the unusual insulating phases found in the cts , but it is not clear how these apparently very different effects come together in the sc state . in this paper",
    "we outline a unified theoretical approach to unconventional sc in the entire family of organic cts , and argue that all three of the above interactions are essential for sc . unlike existing theories of sc in the cts , our work can potentially explain the pairing mechanism in _ all _ @xmath2-filled molecular superconductors , spanning from the quasi - one - dimensional ( 1d ) ( tmttf)@xmath3x to the nearly isotropic two - dimensional ( 2d ) @xmath4-(bedt - ttf)@xmath3cu@xmath3(cn)@xmath5 and etme@xmath5z[pd(dmit)@xmath3]@xmath3 .",
    "the theory may additionally explain sc found in inorganic @xmath2-filled superconductors .",
    "sc in many cts , for example in @xmath4-(et)@xmath3x is proximate to antiferromagnetism ( afm ) .",
    "further , these 2d cts are strongly dimerized suggesting the possibility of describing the material by an effective @xmath7-filled band ( one carrier per dimer ) .",
    "it has consequently been proposed that the @xmath7-filled band repulsive hubbard model on an anisotropic triangular lattice can explain the superconducting behavior of the 2d cts @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7-filled band triangular lattice hubbard model believed to    show sc has two parameters , the onsite coulomb interaction , @xmath0 , and the lattice anisotropy , @xmath8 .",
    "the limit @xmath9 corresponds to the square - lattice hubbard model , which is an afm insulator for any @xmath10 . with increasing @xmath11",
    "the afm state is destroyed giving a paramagnetic metal ( pm ) .",
    "mean field and variational calculations find a narrow d - wave sc region in between afm and pm phases @xcite .",
    "a necessary condition for sc mediated by antiferromagnetic fluctuations is that @xmath0 must _ enhance _ the superconducting pair - pair correlations .",
    "we have calculated exact superconducting pair - pair correlation functions for the @xmath7-filled band triangular hubbard model , and find instead that the strength of pairing correlations always decays monotonically with increasing @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "these results show that there is no sc within this model .",
    "sc in cts is proximate to not only afm but to many other exotic insulating states such as charge ordering ( co ) and spin - peierls ( sp ) states .",
    "we argue that to understand the sc in the cts , one must first understand these insulating states .",
    "this requires returning to the full hamiltonian with the correct band filling ( @xmath2-filled or a carrier density of @xmath12 ) . for the 1d systems our hamiltonian contains inter - site e - p coupling , intra - site e - p coupling , and hubbard and extended hubbard e - e interactions , @xmath13 : @xmath14 ( c^\\dagger_{j,\\sigma}c_{i,\\sigma}+ h.c . ) \\\\ & = & + \\frac{1}{2}k_{\\rm{inter}}\\sum_{\\langle ij \\rangle } ( x_i - x_j)^2 \\nonumber \\\\ h_{\\rm{intra}}&= & g\\sum_i \\nu_i n_i + + \\frac{1}{2}k_{\\rm{intra}}\\sum_{i } \\nu_i^2 \\nonumber \\\\ h_{\\rm{ee}}&=&u\\sum_i n_{i,\\uparrow}n_{i,\\downarrow } + v \\sum_{\\langle ij \\rangle } n_in_j \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath15 creates an electron of spin @xmath16 on site @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the position coordinate of molecule @xmath17 , and @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",

    "in general two different kinds of charge ordered states are possible : ( i ) wigner - crystal .. 1010 .. co driven by the nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath1 , and ( ii ) bond - charge density - wave ( bcdw ) ordering with co pattern .. 1100 .. driven by the cooperation of e - e and e - p interactions . in this notation , ` 1 ' indicates a charge density of 0.5+@xmath24 , and ` 0 ' a charge density of 0.5-@xmath24 . for realistic @xmath25 and",
