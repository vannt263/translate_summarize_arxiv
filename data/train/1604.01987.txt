    "the radio loud active galactic nuclei ( rl agn ) constitute nearly 60% of all the @xmath0-ray sources detected in the first four years of all - sky - survey of the large area telescope ( lat ) on board the _ fermi _ satellite , and listed in the third _ fermi _ gamma - ray lat catalog ( 3fgl ; acero et al .",
    "2015 ) . the overwhelming majority ( 98% ) of the rl agn in the 3fgl have been classified as blazars , i.e. agn with relativistic jets oriented close to the line of sight of the observer ( see the third lat agn catalog , 3lac ; ackerman et al .",
    "the remaining 2% of the lat agn includes mostly radio galaxies whose jets point away from the observer , the so - called misaligned agn ( magn , abdo et al .",
    "2010a ) , and a few agn of other types ( see massaro , thompson & ferrara 2016 for a review ) .",
    "about one third of the 3fgl sources is still unidentified ( 1010 over 3033 ) and it is among them that we may expect to discover new classes of @xmath0-ray emitters .",
    "in blazars , doppler boosted @xmath0-ray emission is produced in a compact , relativistically moving jet region close to the agn .",
    "the origin of the emission detected by _",
    "fermi_-lat in magn is less clear ( abdo et al .",
    "2010a , kataoka et al . 2011 ) , and models of stratified jets or extended emitting regions have been considered .",
    "so far , given the point spread function ( psf ) of _ fermi_-lat , centaurus a remains the only radio galaxy in the 3fgl associated with a @xmath0-ray component that clearly extends beyond the central nuclear region and contributes more than @xmath1250% of the total @xmath0-ray flux ( abdo et al .",
    "this extended @xmath0-ray emission spatially coincides with the giant radio lobes of centaurus a and it is consistent with inverse - comptonization ( ic ) of the relic cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation . in centaurus",
    "a , the detection and imaging of the diffuse @xmath0-ray emission , which is isotropic and not boosted by relativistic effects , is likely possible because of the source physical extension ( @xmath14kpc ) and proximity ( distance of @xmath15mpc ) .",
    "compact radio sources with radio structures fully contained within the central regions of their host galaxies ( @xmath16kpc ) are thought to be the progenitors of the large - scale radio galaxies ( lobes linear sizes of 10s100s kpc ) .",
    "the initial stage of the radio source growth is represented by compact symmetric objects ( csos ) with sub - kpc - scale structures , symmetric radio morphologies , total radio emission dominated by the mini - lobes , and kinematical ages smaller than a few thousand years ( review by orienti 2016 ) .",
    "csos belong to the spectral class of gigahertz - peaked spectrum ( gps ) radio galaxies , characterized by a stable , convex radio spectrum peaking at ghz frequencies ( odea 1998 for a review ) .",
    "some theoretical models predict that csos should be relatively strong @xmath0-ray emitters as their compact radio lobes contain copious amount of highly relativistic particles and are embedded in an environment rich in low - energy photons ( see stawarz at al .",
    "2008 , ostorero et al .",

    "the radio lobes are expanding at sub - relativistic velocities , therefore the @xmath0-ray emission is expected to be isotropic and steady on short timescales ( up to months / years ) .",

    "the double - lobed , compact ( @xmath122 pc ) radio morphology of pks1718@xmath1649  and its estimated age ( @xmath17 years , giroletti & polatidis 2009 ) make this source one of the youngest in the class of csos . throughout the paper we assume a @xmath18cdm cosmology with @xmath19 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 , @xmath200.3 and @xmath210.7 .",

    "this initial analysis of five year accumulation of the _",

    "the 3fgl contains an unassociated @xmath0-ray source ( 3fgl j1728.0 - 6446 ) detected at 4.4@xmath5 level with a slightly different location , for which pks1718@xmath1649  lies just outside the 95% uncertainty radius ( figure [ f1 ] , left panel , table [ t2 ] ) .",
    "we thus performed a new analysis to assess the significance , flux , and location of the @xmath0-ray source , exploiting the improved data quality and statistics of the new pass 8 data release .",
    "we analyzed seven years of the _",
    "fermi_-lat data ( observations from august 8 , 2008 to august 8 , 2015 ) .",
    "we selected events of the pass 8 ( p8r2 ) source class ( atwood et al .",
    "2013 ) and used the adequate instrument response functions for the analysis ( p8r2_v6 ) and the science tools software package version v10r0p5 .",
    "the standard event selections were applied : we used front and back events and applied a zenith angle cut at 90@xmath25  to eliminate earth limb events .",
    "we made use of both the binned and unbinned analyses .",
    "given the long computational times due to the large dataset , we limited the unbinned analysis to consistency checks and , most importantly , to secure the source localization .",
    "we first considered the 0.2@xmath1100 gev band to minimize the systematic errors and study the background contamination ( ackermann et al .",
    "next , we increased the photon statistics by lowering the minimum energy threshold to 0.1 gev . in the latter case , we excluded the data with the lowest quality of the reconstructed direction ( evtype=56 ) and applied a zenith angle cut at 80@xmath25 , to minimize the contribution of the background @xmath0-rays from the earth s limb .",
    "we selected a circular region of interest ( roi ) of 15@xmath25 radius , centered on the radio position of pks 1718@xmath1649 .",
    "the _ fermi _  source model that we adopted to calculate the binned likelihood includes all the 3fgl point - like and diffuse sources within the roi .",
    "additionally , we included the 3fgl sources falling between 15@xmath25 and 25@xmath25 .",
    "in fact , due to the energy - dependent size of the _ fermi_-lat psf , these sources can contribute to the total counts observed within the roi .",
    "the 3fgl only accounts for sources detected within the first four years of observations .",
    "therefore , we carefully applied this initial model to the seven - year dataset and , whenever necessary , we improved it by , e.g. , adding sources that were detected in the following three years . in order to assess the fit quality",
    ", we inspected the residual maps obtained by comparing the _",
    "fermi_-lat count map with a count map created from the best - fit model .",
    "for example , we added a variable radio source , pks  1824@xmath1582 , located @xmath1210.3@xmath25  from the roi center ( flaring in april 2014 , atel # 6067 , atel # 6076 ) .",
    "the photon spectral indices , @xmath26 , of the faintest sources within 7@xmath25  from the roi center were fixed to the values reported in the 3fgl . for sources located 7@xmath25  away from the roi center ,",
    "all the spectral parameters were initially fixed to the respective 3fgl values .",
    "we opportunely modified these values , whenever the inspection of the residuals revealed a significant variation of a source ( e.g. , 3fgl j1703.6 - 6211 , atel # 7330 ) .",
    "the emission model also accounts for the galactic and extragalactic ( and instrumental ) diffuse backgrounds .",
    "we used the ` mapcube ' file ` gll_iem_v06.fits ` and the ` iso_p8r2_v6_v06.txt ` table to describe the emission from the milky way and the isotropic component , respectively .    to test the hypothesis that the @xmath0-ray source reported in the 3fgl",
    "is associated with pks1718@xmath1649 , in the model we substituted 3fgl j1728.0 - 6446 with a source located at the radio position of pks1718@xmath1649 , assuming a power - law spectrum model ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "we performed a fit of the data using the binned maximum likelihood ( _ gtlike _ ) .",

    "the best fit photon spectral index , @xmath62.9@xmath70.3 , is steeper than that measured at @xmath34 gev , but the two values are consistent within the uncertainties . as a check",
    ", we restricted the analysis to the two best quality quartiles of the data in the psf type partition ( event types psf2 and psf3 ) , i.e. the data with the best quality of the reconstructed direction of the photons .",
    "we used the python package ` s`ummedlikelihood to combine the likelihoods of the separately analyzed ( psf2 and psf3 type ) datasets . despite the significant cut in event number , we detected a source at the position of pks1718@xmath1649  with a ts@xmath1224 and spectral parameters consistent within the uncertainties with the 0.1@xmath1100 gev best fit values .",
    "the source is not detected at a significance level exceeding ts=10 on yearly timescales .",
    "the incremental time analysis shows that the source begins to be significantly detected over 4 years .",
    "the ts value progressively increases over 5 , 6 and 7 years , whereas the measured flux does not vary significantly ( table [ t1 ] ) .      in order to optimize the localization of the @xmath0-ray source , we ran the _ gtfindsrc _",
    "tool , which calculates the best ts for different positions given an initial guess ( in this case pks1718@xmath1649  coordinates ) until the convergence tolerance for a positional fit is reached .",
    "the best fit position and the corresponding 68% and 95% error radii are reported in table [ t2 ] .",

    "finally , we fit to the data a model with two distinct emitters located at the positions of pks1718@xmath1649  and 3fgl j1728.0 - 6446 : the @xmath0-ray emission in excess over the background is attributed to the former , whereas the latter has ts@xmath120 .",

    "for the remaining 14 sumss sources , the flux faintness ( only three of them have 843 mhz fluxes in the 100200 mjy range ) , non - detection at the higher frequencies , and lack of a 2mass counterpart strongly disfavor the identification with an extragalactic , flat spectrum radio source .",

    "<S> we report the @xmath0-ray detection of a young radio galaxy , pks1718@xmath1649 , belonging to the class of compact symmetric objects ( csos ) , with the large area telescope ( lat ) on board the _ fermi _ satellite . </S>",
    "<S> the third _ fermi _ gamma - ray lat catalog ( 3fgl ) includes an unassociated @xmath0-ray source , 3fglj1728.0@xmath16446 , located close to pks1718@xmath1649 . using the latest pass 8 calibration </S>",
    "<S> , we confirm that the best fit @xmath2 position of the @xmath0-ray source is compatible with the radio location of pks1718@xmath1649 . </S>",
    "<S> cross - matching of the @xmath0-ray source position with the positions of blazar sources from several catalogs yields negative results . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we conclude that pks1718@xmath1649 is the most likely counterpart to the unassociated lat source . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a detection test statistics ts@xmath3 ( @xmath45@xmath5 ) with a best fit photon spectral index @xmath62.9@xmath70.3 and a 0.1 - 100 gev photon flux density @xmath8(11.5@xmath70.3)@xmath9 ph @xmath10 s@xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the linear size ( @xmath122 pc ) , the kinematic age ( @xmath12100 years ) , and the source distance ( @xmath13 ) make pks1718@xmath1649 an ideal candidate for @xmath0-ray detection in the framework of the model proposing that the most compact and the youngest csos can efficiently produce gev radiation via inverse - compton scattering of the ambient photon fields by the radio lobe non - thermal electrons . </S>",
    "<S> thus , our detection of the source in @xmath0-rays establishes young radio galaxies as a distinct class of extragalactic high - energy emitters , and yields a unique insight on the physical conditions in compact radio lobes interacting with the interstellar medium of the host galaxy . </S>"
