    "perturbation of various kinds may produce discontinuities in astrophysical fluid flow .",
    "discontinuities in fluid flow are said to take place over one or more surfaces when any dynamical and / or thermodynamic quantity may change discontinuously as such surfaces are crossed ; the corresponding surfaces are called surfaces of discontinuity .",
    "certain boundary conditions are to be satisfied across such surfaces and according to those conditions , surfaces of discontinuities are classified into various categories ; the most important are being the shock waves or shocks , which , when the flow is adiabatic , obey the following conditions ( landau & lifsitz , 1959 , ll hereafter ) : @xmath3=0,~ \\left[p+{\\rho}u^2\\right]=0,~ \\left[\\frac{u^2}{2}+w\\right]=0\\ ] ] where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the fluid density , flow velocity , fluid pressure and the enthalpy of the flow respectively , and for any two arbitrary flow variables @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath8\\equiv \\left\\{\\left(\\alpha+\\beta \\right)_{-}-\\left(\\alpha+\\beta \\right)_{+}\\right\\}\\ ] ] @xmath9\\equiv\\left\\{{\\alpha_-}{\\beta_-}-{\\alpha_+}{\\beta_+}\\right\\}.\\ ] ] the subscripts @xmath10 and @xmath11 refer to the quantities measured just after and just before the flow encounters the surface(s ) of discontinuity .",
    "quite often , such shock waves are generated in various kinds of supersonic astrophysical flows having intrinsic angular momentum , resulting in a flow which becomes subsonic .",
    "this is because of the fact that the repulsive centrifugal potential barrier experienced by such flows are sufficiently strong to brake the motion and a stationary solution could be introduced only through a shock .",
    "rotating , transonic astrophysical fluid flows are thus believed to be ` prone ' to the shock formation phenomena .",
    "it has been established in recent years that in order to satisfy the inner boundary conditions imposed by the event horizon , accretion onto black holes should exhibit transonic properties in general ; which further indicates that formation of shock waves are possible in astrophysical fluid flows onto galactic and extra - galactic black holes .",
    "one also expects that shock formation in black hole accretion discs might be a general phenomenon because shock waves in rotating astrophysical flows are convincingly able to provide an important and efficient mechanism for conversion of a significant amount of the gravitational energy ( available from deep potential wells created by these massive compact accretors ) into radiation by randomizing the directed infall motion of the accreting fluid .",
    "hence shocks possibly play an important role in governing the overall dynamical and radiative processes taking place in astrophysical fluids and plasma accreting onto black holes .",
    "thus the study of steady , standing , stationary shock waves produced in black hole accretion has acquired a very important status in recent years .",
    "+ the issue of the formation of steady , standing shock waves in black hole accretion discs is addressed in two different ways in general .",
    "first , one can study the formation of rankine - hugoniot shock waves ( rhsw ) in a polytropic flow .",
    "radiative cooling in this type of shock is quite inefficient .",
    "no energy is dissipated at the shock and the total specific energy of the accreting material is a shock - conserved quantity .",
    "entropy is generated at the shock and the post - shock flow possesses a higher entropy accretion rate than it s pre - shock counterpart .",
    "the flow changes its temperature permanently at the shock .",
    "higher post - shock temperature puffs up the post - shock flow and a quasi - spherical , quasi - toroidal centrifugal pressure supported boundary layer is formed in the inner region of the accretion disc .",
    "fukue ( 1987 ) was the pioneer to initiate the systematic study of such shock dynamics using a rigorous equation of state valid for from the non - relativistic regime to the highly relativistic regime .",
    "then chakrabarti and collaborators ( chakrabarti 1989 , 1996 and references therein , abramowicz & chakrabarti 1990 , chakrabarti and molteni 1993 ) used the vertically integrated flow model of matsumoto et .",
    "al . ( 1984 ) to extended fukue s work towards the global study of shock formation in post - newtonian geometry .",
    "however , such shock solutions were obtained either on a case by case basis , or , even when successful attempts were made to provide a more complete analysis , the boundary of the parameter space responsible for shock formation was obtained only for global variation of the total specific energy @xmath12 ( or accretion rate @xmath13 ) and specific angular momentum @xmath1 of the flow , and not for variations of the polytropic constant @xmath14 of the flow ; rather , accretion was usually considered to be ultra - relativistic and @xmath15 respectively , according to the terminology used in frank et .",
    "al . 1992 . ] , which may _ not _ always be a realistic assumption . as @xmath14 is expected to have great influence on the radiative properties of the flow in general , ignoring the explicit dependence of shock solutions on @xmath14 limits claims of generality .",
    "also , all such so - called global shock solutions have been discussed only in the context of one particular type of pseudo - schwarzschild black hole potential , namely , the paczyski & wiita ( 1980 ) potential ( @xmath16 hereafter ) . for accretion in kerr geometry ,",
    "various authors ( lu 1985,1986 , lu et al 1987 , nakayama and fukue 1989 ) made attempts to provide a complete general relativistic description of shocked accretion flow by making a number of assumptions , some of which , however , may not appear to be fully convincing ( see a detail discussion in das 2002 ) and it is fair to say that no well accepted complete general relativistic global shock solution exclusively obtained for a hydrodynamic accretion disc around a schwarzschild bh has yet appeared in the literature . motivated by these limitations , das ( 2002 , d02 hereafter ) provided a generalized formalism allowing one to construct and solve the equations governing the hydrodynamic black hole accretion of a polytropic fluid in all available pseudo - schwarzschild potentials which may contain steady , standing rhsw . in this work ,",
    "the explicit dependence of shock solutions on all important accretion parameters was thoroughly studied . the generalized formalism developed by d02",
    "has also been used to explain related interesting phenomena like the analytical computation of qpo frequencies ( das 2003 ) and the generation of accretion powered - galactic jets ( das , rao and vadawale 2003 ) .",
    "+ in another class of shock study , one concentrates on shock formation in isothermal black hole accretion discs .",
    "the characteristic features of such shocks are quite different from the non - dissipative shocks discussed above . in isothermal shocks , the accretion flow is allowed to dissipate a part of its energy and entropy at the shock surface to keep the post - shock temperature equal to its pre - shock value . this maintains the vertical thickness of the flow exactly the same just before and just after the shock is formed .",
    "simultaneous jumps in energy and entropy join the pre - shock supersonic flow to its post - shock subsonic counterpart .",
    "chakrabarti ( 1989a , c89 hereafter ) studied the properties of such shocks in the rotating isothermal accretion around compact objects .",
    "however , his work was restricted to only one post - newtonian black hole potential , i.e. , the paczyski and wiita ( 1980 ) potential @xmath17 and the dependence of shock parameters on initial boundary conditions was not thoroughly studied .",
    "also , the degeneracy of the shock locations was not removed completely .",
    "later on , yang and kafatos ( 1995 , yk hereafter ) investigated the formation of isothermal shocks and studied the stability properties of such shocks for general relativistic accretion onto schwarzschild black holes .",
    "they also , quite successfully , computed the jump conditions for relativistic shocks .",
    "yk analyzed the stability of shocks in a more efficient way compared to the method used by c89 and could remove the two - fold degeneracy of shock locations ; in this way they could properly identify the most stable shock location .",
    "however , unlike c89 , yk used a one - dimensional conical model for accretion discs , where the existence of vertical hydrostatic equilibrium was not taken into account .",
    "also , the explicit dependence of various shock - related quantities on accretion parameters was not fully explored .",
    "nevertheless , yk still deserves special attention because it is the only work in the literature which attempts to study isothermal shock formation in a fully relativistic frame work .",
    "+ in this paper , we would like to address the issue of shock formation in isothermal black hole accretion discs from a more general point of view . instead of confining our calculation to a particular black hole potential , _ all _ available pseudo - schwarzschild potentials",
    "will be exhaustively used to investigate the possibility of shock formation in hydrodynamic , inviscid , isothermal black hole accretion discs . following matsumoto et .",
    "al . ( 1984 ) , we will be using the vertically integrated 1.5-dimensional model to describe the structure of the accretion discs , which is , perhaps , more realistic compared to simplified one dimensional conical flow model used by yk .",
    "in this 1.5 dimensional model ( which has extensive use in literature , see chakrabarti 1996 and references therein ) the equations of motion are written on the equatorial plane of the central accretor whereas the flow remains in hydrostatic equilibrium in the transverse direction . for all black hole potentials",
    "we first formulate and solve the equations governing multi - transonic accretion and wind around the central accretor in terms of _ only _ two parameters , namely , specific flow angular momentum @xmath1 and flow temperature @xmath0 .",
    "then we provide a self - consistent scheme to capture the stable shock location(s ) for multi - transonic accretion flow and finally we thoroughly study the dependence of various shock related quantities on fundamental accretion parameters . in this way we provide a generalized two parameter solution scheme for multi - transonic isothermal black hole accretion disc for all available pseudo - scharzschild black hole potentials which contains dissipative shock waves .",
    "our generalized formalism assures that our model is not just an artifact of a particular type of potential only , and inclusion of every black hole potential allows a substantially extended zone of parameter space allowing for the possibility of shock formation .",
    "+ rigorous investigation of the complete general relativistic multi - transonic black hole accretion disc and wind is believed to be extremely complicated . at the same time",
    "it is understood that as relativistic effects play an important role in the regions close to the accreting black hole ( where most of the gravitational potential energy is released ) , purely newtonian gravitational potential ( in the form @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the mass of the compact accretor ) can not be a realistic choice to describe transonic black hole accretion in general .",
    "to compromise between the ease of handling of a newtonian description of gravity and the realistic situations described by complicated general relativistic calculations , a series of ` modified ' newtonian potentials have been introduced to describe the general relativistic effects that are most important for accretion disc structure around schwarzschild black holes .",
    "introduction of such potentials allows one to investigate the complicated physical processes taking place in disc accretion in a semi - newtonian framework by avoiding pure general relativistic calculations so that most of the features of spacetime around a compact object are retained and some crucial properties of the analogous relativistic solutions of disc structure could be reproduced with high accuracy .",
    "hence , those potentials might be designated as ` pseudo- schwarzschild ' potentials .",
    "our calculations in this paper will be based on four such pseudo schwarzschild potentials .",
    "explicit forms of those four potentials are the following ( see das & sarkar 2001 , d02 and artemova , bjrnsson & novikov 1996 , abn hereafter , and references therein , for detail discussion about various properties of these potentials ) : @xmath20\\ ] ] @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the radial co - ordinate scaled in units of schwarzschild radius .",
    "hereafter , we will define the schwarzschild radius @xmath23 as @xmath24 ( where @xmath19 is the mass of the black hole , @xmath25 is universal gravitational constant and @xmath26 is velocity of light in vacuum ) so that the marginally bound circular orbit @xmath27 and the last stable circular orbit @xmath28 take the values @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively for a typical schwarzschild black hole .",
    "also , total mechanical energy per unit mass on @xmath28 ( sometimes called ` efficiency ' @xmath31 ) may be computed as @xmath32 for this case .",
    "we will use a simplified geometric unit throughout this paper where radial distance @xmath22 is scaled in units of @xmath23 , radial dynamical velocity @xmath33 and polytropic sound speed @xmath34 of the flow is scaled in units of @xmath26 ( the velocity of light in vacuum ) , mass @xmath35 is scaled in units of @xmath19 and all other derived quantities would be scaled accordingly . for simplicity , we will use @xmath36 . among the above potentials , @xmath37",
    "was introduced by paczyski and wiita ( 1980 ) which accurately reproduces the positions of @xmath28 and @xmath27 .",
    "also the keplerian distribution of angular momentum obtained using this potential is exactly the same as that obtained in a pure schwarzschild geometry .",
    "@xmath38 was proposed by nowak and wagoner ( 1991 ) to approximate some of the dominant relativistic effects of the accreting black hole ( slowly rotating or non rotating ) via a modified newtonian potential .",
    "it has the correct form of @xmath28 , and it produces the best approximation for the value of the angular velocity @xmath39 ( as measured at infinity ) at @xmath28 and the radial epicyclic frequency @xmath40 ( for @xmath41 ) .",
    "@xmath42 and @xmath43 were proposed by artemova , bjrnsson & novikov 1996 , abn hereafter , to produce exactly the same value of the free - fall acceleration of a test particle at a given value of @xmath22 as is obtained for a test particle at rest with respect to the schwarzschild reference frame ( @xmath44 ) and to produce the value of the free fall acceleration that is equal to the value of the covariant component of the three dimensional free - fall acceleration vector of a test particle that is at rest in the schwarzschild reference frame ( @xmath45 ) respectively .",
    "hereafter , we will denote any @xmath46th potential as @xmath47 where @xmath48 corresponds to @xmath49 respectively .",
    "+ at this point , one may ask why we are interested in studying shock formation ( and the overall structure of the isothermal black hole accretion disc in general ) for various pseudo schwarzschild potentials when yk have already performed shock study using complete general relativistic frame work .",
    "the answer is mainly two - fold .",
    "firstly , we have used , perhaps , a more realistic flow geometry ( 1.5 dimensional vertically integrated disc model ) than that of yk and we have provided a more detail dependence of various shock related quantities on fundamental accretion parameters . secondly , and more seriously , even if someone can provide a completely satisfactory model for shock formation in full general relativistic isothermal black hole accretion , still the importance of our work may not be under estimated as we believe . rigorous investigation of some of the shock related phenomena is extremely difficult ( if not completely impossible ) to study using full general relativistic framework .",
    "hence one is expected to always rely on these pseudo - potentials because of the ease of handling them .",
    "also , there are possibilities that in future someone may come up with a pseudo - schwarzschild potential better than any of the potentials used in this paper , which will be the best approximation for complete general relativistic investigation of multi - transonic shocked flow . in such case , if one already formulates a generalized model for multi - transonic shocked isothermal accretion disc for any arbitrary black hole potential , exactly what we have done in this paper , then that generalized model will be able to readily accommodate that new @xmath50 without having any significant change in the fundamental structure of the formulation and solution scheme of the model and we need not have to worry about providing any new scheme exclusively valid only for that new potential , if any .",
    "hereafter we all use the notation @xmath51_{i}$ ] for a set of values of @xmath2 for any particular @xmath52 .",
    "it is to be mentioned here that for spherically symmetric isothermal accretion , one can solve the whole problem if only @xmath0 alone is known .",
    "a one parameter solution scheme for bondi ( 1952 ) type black hole accretion in all @xmath52s has also been formulated quite recently ( sarkar & das 2002 ) . for isothermal equation of state ,",
    "@xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the pressure , density , constant temperature and the constant isothermal acoustic velocity of the flow respectively , @xmath56 and @xmath57 being universal gas constant and the mean molecular weight , @xmath55 and @xmath0 can be related as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a constant , @xmath60 being the mass of the hydrogen atom and @xmath40 is boltzman s constant . following standard literature",
    ", we consider a thin , rotating , axisymmetric , inviscid steady flow in hydrostatic equilibrium in transverse direction .",
    "the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium is justified for a thin flow because for such flows , the infall time scale is expected to exceed the local sound crossing time scale in the direction transverse to the flow .",
    "the flow is also assumed to posses considerably large radial velocity which makes the flow ` advective ' .",
    "we also assume that the disc to be non - self - gravitating , i.e. the increase of @xmath19 due to the accretion process itself is negligible .",
    "the local half - thickness @xmath61 of the disc for any @xmath62 can be obtained by balancing the gravitational force by pressure gradient and can be expressed as @xmath63 where @xmath64 . the radial momentum conservation equation and the equation of continuity",
    "could be written as : @xmath65=0 \\eqno{(4a)}\\ ] ] @xmath66=0 \\eqno{(4b)}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 is the effective potential which can be defined as the summation of the gravitational potential and the centrifugal potential for matter accreting under the influence of @xmath68 and can be expressed as : @xmath69 however , for inviscid flow , @xmath70 has been assumed to be @xmath1 only .",
    "one can calculate the expression for the effective potential in full general relativity ( d02 ) : @xmath71 to show that unlike @xmath67 , @xmath72 can not be obtained by linearly combining the gravitational and rotational energy contributions because various energies in general relativity are combined together to produce non - linearly coupled new terms .",
    "( 2a - 2b ) and ( 3 ) , we integrate eq.(4a-4b ) to obtain two conservation equations for our flow as : @xmath73 @xmath74 where * c * is a constant and @xmath75 is the mass accretion rate . the subscript @xmath76 indicates the values measured on the equatorial plane of the disc ; however , we will drop @xmath76 hereafter if no confusion arises in doing so and will denote @xmath75 by @xmath13 .",

    "( 7 ) equal zero .",

    "for all @xmath52 , we find a significant region of parameter space spanned by @xmath51_{i}$ ] which allows the multiplicity of sonic points for accretion as well as for wind where two real physical inner and outer ( with respect to the black hole location ) @xmath91 type sonic points @xmath92 and @xmath93 encompass one @xmath94 type unphysical middle sonic point @xmath95 in between . for a fixed set of @xmath2 , one can solve eq .",
    "( 9 ) to obtain required sonic points and for a particular set of values of @xmath2 , one obtains at most four real roots , one of which is always less than one @xmath23 , hence falls inside the event horizon .",

    "apparently there remains an ambiguity in determining the values of @xmath51_{i}$ ] for which three sonic points form in accretion and the values of @xmath51_i$ ] for which three sonic points form in wind because just by studying the values of @xmath2 or @xmath96 , one can not determine whether it is accretion or wind which is multi - transonic for that @xmath51_{i}$ ] .",
    "however , we can unambiguously classify the parameter space in the following way : + let us suppose that for a particular value of @xmath51_{i}$ ] , accretion can be multi - transonic .",
    "so the subsonic far field solution will become supersonic after crossing the outer sonic point @xmath97 in accretion .",
    "it would manifest the tendency for passing through the inner sonic point @xmath98 again after a shock transition if the solution passing through the inner sonic point is more preferred by nature for some physical reason(s ) .",

    "the shock location correlates with @xmath1 as well as with @xmath0 .",
    "this is obvious because a rapidly rotating flow will generate a centrifugal barrier at a relatively large distance from the event horizon and a hotter flow will generate sufficient amount of thermal pressure to break the flow well away from the black hole .",
    "also it is observed that the stronger the shock ( shock with large compression ratio ) , the higher the amount of dissipated energy at the shock location and that a shock formed closer to the event horizon will result in a larger amount of energy dissipation .",
    "this is also obvious because the closer the shock location to the event horizon , the higher the amount of available gravitational potential energy to be dissipated at the shock .",
    "the existing literature on shock formation in black hole accretion discs are heavily inclined towards the study of polytropic accretion and non - dissipative shocks while the formation of dissipative shocks in an isothermal flow is a relatively less well studied subject .",
    "such a ` preferential investigation ' is perhaps due to the fact that global isothermality in ` black hole accretion ' is difficult to achieve for realistic flows ( it is difficult to maintain exactly the same temperature throughout a disc ) , the more realistic kind of accretion is expected to be described using a polytropic equation of state .",
    "however , one should never forget that the techniques developed to study disc geometry and shock dynamics in all existing literature ( including the present paper ) are heavily based on various assumptions , and hence , are far from being sufficiently complete and self - consistent to model the exact physical situation . even if the vertically integrated 1.5 dimensional disc model developed by matsumoto et .",
    "al . ( 1984 ) , which has been used in this paper , is believed to be one of the most successful disc models , it suffers from a number of limitations in studying the polytropic shock dynamics .",
    "one of such major limitations is , even for an extremely thin shock , i.e. a polytropic shock with effective zero thickness , the thickness of the flow ( i.e. the disc thickness ) changes abruptly at the shock ( pre and post shock half thickness of the polytropic flow is quite different ) and it is impossible to write down the exact pressure balance condition at the shock by vertical averaging . on the other hand , for isothermal flows with dissipative shocks ( the kind of shock dynamics studied in this paper ) at constant acoustic velocity ,",
    "the flow thickness remains the same ( because of the quick removal of dissipated energy ) and a correct pressure balance condition is obtained .",
    "hence we believe that the study of shock formation in isothermal flow is quite important in its own right and we have provided _ for the first time _ a generalized formalism to study such shocks for _ all _ available pseudo - schwarzschild black hole potentials .",
    "also we have studied the _ complete _ disc dynamics for multi - transonic accretion and wind and have demonstrated _ all _ the shock solutions and successfully studied the dependence of important shock quantities on every fundamental accretion parameter .",
    "however , in this work is has not been possible to compare the different potentials in connection to the suitability of mimicking the exact general relativistic solutions as was done in d02 .",
    "it was beyond the scope of this paper to formulate and solve the complete general relativistic set of equations governing the isothermal accretion and wind , we hope to present that work somewhere else . + it is to be mentioned here that a number of recent works study the dynamical and radiative properties of the post - shock region of advective accretion discs ( inner part of the disc , so to say ) in order to understand the spectral properties of the black hole candidate ( shrader & titarchuk 1998 , and references therein ) and to theoretically explain a number of diverse phenomena which are supposed to take place in the inner part of the shocked black hole accretion discs .",
    "( titarchuk , lapidus & muslimov 1998 , and references therein , das 1998 , das & chakrabarti , 1999 , das 2003 , das , rao & vadawale , 2003 , naik et.al .",
    "the importance of studying the physics of post - shock accretion flow has also been realized from observational evidence ( rutledge et .",
    "al . 1999 ,",
    "muno , morgan & remillard 1999 , webb & malkan 2000 , smith , heindl and swank 2002 ) .",
    "thus we believe that our generalized model presented in this paper may have far reaching consequences in handling various shock related phenomena because this model deals with all available black hole potentials . nevertheless , one limitation of our model is that we have assumed the flow to be totally inviscid and viscous dissipation of azimuthal angular momentum was not taken into account .",
    "exact modeling of viscous multi - transonic black hole accretion , including proper heating and cooling mechanisms , is quite an arduous task , and we did not dare to attempt that in this paper .",
    "however , qualitative calculations show that the introduction of viscosity via a radius - dependent power - law distribution for angular momentum only weakens the strength of the centrifugal barrier and pushes the shock location closer to the event horizon , keeping the overall basic physics concerning the shock dynamics and related issues unaltered ; details of this work is in progress and will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "+ in our work , some of the examples of the shocked multi - transonic flow , especially for flows in @xmath170 and @xmath171 , contain low intrinsic angular momentum .",
    "such weakly rotating flows may be found in nature in systems like detached or semi - detached binaries fed by accretion from ob stellar winds ( illarianov & sunyaev 1975 , liang & nolan 1984 ) , semi - detached low - mass non - magnetic binaries ( bisikalo et al . 1998 ) or super - massive black holes fed by accretion from slowly rotating central stellar clusters ( illarionov 1988 , ho 1999 and references therein ) . + it is now a well established fact that a number of galactic black hole candidate show @xmath172 behaviours .",
    "associated large amplitudes and short time scales of such intensity variation suggests that such oscillations are a diagnostic of the accretion processes in the innermost regions of the accretion discs of the central accretor ( van derkliss , 1989 , and references therein ) and it has been suggested in recent years that such @xmath172s may be generated because of the shock oscillation in black hole accretion discs ( molteni , sponholz & chakrabarti 1996 , titarchuk , lapidus & muslimov 1999 ) we apply our shock solutions obtained in this paper to compute the frequency of the qpos generated by such shock oscillations ( das 2003 ) and study the dependence of such frequencies on various fundamental accretion and shock parameters .",
    "+ we would like to complete our discussion by pointing out one important finding in our work . since the accretion flows discussed in this paper",
    "are chosen to be inviscid and non - dissipative , most of the binding energy of the flow is dissipated at the shocks .",
    "thus such shocks can serve as the efficient provider of effective radiative cooling mechanism in the accretion discs . from fig .",
    "6 it is evident that for some region of parameter space spanned by @xmath51_i$ ] , the amount of energy dissipated at the shock could be as high as more than ten percent of the total rest mass energy of the flow .",
    "this large amount of energy has to be immediately removed from the accretion disc ( at least from the equatorial plane ) to maintain the isothermality of the flow .",
    "this dissipated energy may be drained from the disc through various processes like a sudden x - ray burst ( flare ) of energy from the accretion discs close to the event horizon ( few @xmath23 away ) or through energetic leptonic/ baryonic outflows and jets , the formation of which is likely to be initiated by this huge amount of dissipated energy at the shock .",
    "observational signature of such flares from the close vicinity of our galactic centre black hole has already been reported quite recently ( baganoff et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the observed length scale of the accretion flow from where such flares are generated , are in fairly close agreements with our theoretical calculations presented in this paper .",
    "thus one concludes that the kind of shock discussed in this paper could be efficiently radiative and ` bright ' .",
    "the energy dissipation at the shock and it s channeling from the accretion disc system may explain some interesting related issues like shock generated x - ray flares and the qpo of galactic microquasars ( das & rao 2003 , in preparation ) and the generation mechanism of accretion powered galactic jet ( das 2003a , in preparation ) .",

    "<S> unlike previous works in this field , our calculation is _ not _ restricted to any particular kind of post - newtonian gravitational potentials , rather we use _ all _ available pseudo - schwarzschild potentials to formulate and solve the equations governing the accretion and wind only in terms of flow temperature @xmath0 and specific angular momentum @xmath1 of the flow . </S>",

    "<S> we observe that a significant region of parameter space spanned by @xmath2 allows shock formation . </S>",
    "<S> our generalized formalism assures that the shock formation is not just an artifact of a particular type of gravitational potential , rather inclusion of all available black - hole potentials demonstrates a substantially extended zone of parameter space allowing for the possibility of shock formation . </S>",
