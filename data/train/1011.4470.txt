    "focusing light using negative refraction is an emerging subject mixing fascinating and elusive features .",
    "it is now well known that one can reverse the flow of light with negative refractive index materials , within which light takes the `` _ wrong _ '' turn in accordance with inverted snell - descartes laws of refraction @xcite .",
    "however , there has been a growing interest in a better control of light through transformational optics , following the recent proposals by pendry et al .",
    "@xcite and leonhardt @xcite .",
    "the former seminal paper demonstrates the possibility of designing a cloak that renders any object inside it invisible to electromagnetic radiation ( using the covariant structure of maxwell s equations ) , while the latter concentrates on the ray optics limit ( using conformal mappings in the complex plane ) . in both cases ,",
    "the cloak consists of a meta - material whose physical properties ( permittivity and permeability ) are spatially varying as well as anisotropic .",
    "importantly , if one considers a point source located inside the cloak , it appears to radiate from a shifted location : cloaking is nothing but a mirage effect @xcite . if one adopts this viewpoint , complementary media @xcite within which focussing effects via negative refraction occur can be designed using geometric transforms by mapping the image plane back onto the source plane @xcite .",
    "such lenses were coined as alice mirrors in @xcite since they exhibit certain anti - symmetric features .",
    "these make also possible perfect and poor man s cylindrical lenses @xcite , as well as generalized corner and checkerboard lenses @xcite",
    ".    however , there are other types of electromagnetic waves well worth controlling such as surface plasmon polaritons ( spps ) that allow for fascinating applications in the emerging field of nano - optics @xcite . back in 1998 , ebbesen et al .",
    "established that resonant excitation of spps on a metal film perforated at subwavelength periodicities leads to unusually high transmission coefficients  @xcite .",
    "pendry , martin - moreno and garcia - vidal further showed in 2004 that one can manipulate spps by structuring perfectly conducting surfaces in a periodic manner @xcite .",
    "other plasmonic metamaterials include plasmonic shells with a suitable out - of - phase polarizability in order to compensate the scattering from the knowledge of the electromagnetic parameters of the object to hide , and external cloaking , whereby a plasmonic resonance cancels the external field at the location of a set of electric dipoles @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we extend the design of transformation based perfect lens to the focussing of surface plasmon polaritons ( spps ) .",
    "the field of plasmonics has matured to the point where an introduction to the optical properties of metals and sometimes even surface plasmons is included in many standard texts in solid - state physics and optics , with a state of the art on meta - surfaces available in @xcite .",
    "interestingly , agranovich et al . have shown in 2004 that one can obtain negative refraction for exciton - plasmon waves in organic and gyrotropic material using a surface transition layer @xcite .",
    "our main contribution here is that we explain how one can manipulate spps in such a way that the electromagnetic space where they live is folded back onto itself , so that we can extend the proposal of pendry and ramakrishna to build generalized lenses using the original concept of complementary media @xcite to the area of plasmonic waves .",
    "this allows for instance the design of perfect corners , corner lenses and the like @xcite , using transformational plasmonics tools @xcite .",
    "importantly , we also perform full wave computations to exemplify the imaging effects of spps through negative refraction in a novel class of generalised plasmonic lenses .",
    "let us consider two semi - infinite regions separated by a plane interface at @xmath0 .",
    "the upper region ( @xmath1 ) is filled with air i.e. with relative permittivity @xmath2 ( resp .",
    "relative permeability @xmath3 ) , while the lower region ( @xmath4 ) is filled with a drude metal i.e. with relative permittivity @xmath5 ( resp . relative permeability @xmath6 ) : here , some gold with the plasma frequency ( @xmath7 thz ) and characteristic collision frequency ( @xmath8 thz ) .",
    "we would like to map these two isotropic homogeneous media on two metamaterials described by anisotropic heterogeneous matrices of permittivity and permeability given by @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the transformation matrix constructed using the jacobian associated with the change of coordinates .",
    "let us emphasize here that in our numerical implementation , we make use of finite edge elements that are nothing but discrete whitney differential forms , and behave nicely under pull - back transforms .",
    "thus , in what follows , we always map the destination domain onto the original one ( so we consider the inverse transforms ) .",
    "interface ; ( c ) underlying mechanism . ]    the original perfect lens presupposed a slab of material with @xmath11 = -1 and @xmath12 = -1 .",
    "let us now derive the result using the powerful tool of transformational plasmonics @xcite . in order to design generalized lenses for surface plasmon polaritons ,",
    "we want to fold the plasmonic space back onto itself , and this leads to negative coefficients within the permittivity and permeability matrices .",
    "the coordinate transformation is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the thickness of the generalized lens .",
    "the above coordinate transform leads to the identity for the transformation matrix @xmath15 outside the lens , whereas inside the lens i.e. for @xmath16 , @xmath17 which flips the sign of @xmath18 , so that the material properties differ from free space only for points along the @xmath19 direction .",
    "the above analysis demonstrates that spp focussing will always occur irrespective of the medium in which the lens is embedded .",
    "this is true for any medium which is mirror antisymmetric about a vertical plane . in the plasmonic case",
    ", we can define two complementary media above the metal surface and two complementary media within the metal as @xmath20 case @xmath21 corresponds to the top region : @xmath22 , while case @xmath23 corresponds to the bottom region @xmath24 , with @xmath2 and @xmath25 as in ( [ drude ] ) , we report in figure [ fig2 ] some finite element computations showing focussing of a spp at a wavelength of @xmath26 nm for two such complementary media i.e. a checkerboard lens for the special case @xmath27 . the cancellation of _ plasmonic _ space is noted .",
    "we further show in figure [ fig3 ] a focussing effect through a plasmonic flat lens with @xmath28 .",
    "the source and the perfect images indeed satisfy the inverted snell - descartes laws of negative refraction , as shown for a spp beam incident upon the lens at an angle of 45 degrees .",
    "however , in the case of anisotropic @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the transformed media are now characterized in the region @xmath31 by @xmath32 we note that there is no change in the impedance of the media , since the permittivity and permeability undergo the same geometric transformation : the perfect lens is impedance - matched with its surrounding medium ( air , say ) so that no reflection will occur at its interfaces .",
    "nanometers : @xmath33 in yellow block , @xmath34 in orange block with their drude metal counterparts @xmath35 in dark yellow block , @xmath36 in red block underneath .",
    "( b ) the middle regions cancel each other , leading to ( d ) . ]",
    "then the resulting complementary medium ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) is given by @xmath37 where @xmath2 and @xmath25 are as in ( [ drude ] ) , and @xmath21 for @xmath1 and @xmath23 for @xmath38 .",
    "this is a generalization to transformational plasmonics of the result first derived in @xcite and retrieved again using group theory ( symmetries of maxwell s equations ) in @xcite .",
    "the entries in @xmath39 and @xmath40 can also be spatially varying along @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "this covers the case of perfect corner reflectors of @xmath43-fold skew - symmetry and we are therefore ensured of the cancellation of the plasmonic path .",
    "it is worth noting that the generalized lens theorem was also applied to infinite checkerboards of skew - symmetry in @xcite .",
    "nanometers : ( a ) the medium @xmath44 in the yellow block and its drude metal counterpart underneath @xmath45 , @xmath46 ; ( b ) top and side views of the computed field for a spp line source ; ( c ) negatively refracted spp beam making an angle of @xmath47 degrees with the lens . ]    we now extend the dispersion relation for a surface plasmon at the interface between a transformed medium and a transformed metal @xcite to the case where we have four media described by diagonal tensors of relative permittivity and permeability : @xmath48 and @xmath49 with @xmath21 when @xmath1 and @xmath23 when @xmath4 , see figure [ fig1 ] ( a ) , the spp propagating at the metal surface has a wavenumber satisfying :    @xmath50    where @xmath51 denotes the @xmath52 transformed medium and its drude metal counterpart .",
    "this formula also characterizes the wavenumber of an spp propagating at a multi - layered metal surface , whereby the number @xmath53 of complementary regions is only constrained by the overall propagation length of the spp .    following the work by shen et al .",
    "@xcite on two - dimensional anisotropic perfect lenses , we report in figure [ anisotropic ] some computations for an spp ( gaussian beam ) incident from the left on such a lens in the three - dimensional transformational plasmonic setting . above the metal interface",
    ", the transformed medium is described by @xmath54 and @xmath55 for the bottom layer , the transformed metal is described by : @xmath56 and @xmath57 which is a particular case of ( [ sarlens2 ] ) . in panels ( b ) and",
    "( d ) of figure [ anisotropic ] , we place a line source within the slab lens ( shown by point @xmath58 in panel ( a ) ) , and we observe two perfect images on either sides of the anisotropic lens , in accordance with the inverted snell - descartes laws of refraction .",
    "we note that on the vertical sides of this lens , the following condition is met :    @xmath59    where @xmath60 describe the ambient medium above the surface ( air ) and @xmath25 is as in ( [ drude ] ) and @xmath6 .",
    "hence , the slab lens is perfectly matched to the surrounding medium .",
    "we numerically check this fact by sending a gaussian spp beam with a waste of @xmath61 nanometers on this less than usual lens .",
    "the wavefront shrinks within the lens , but forward and backward scatterings do not sense the presence of the lens : the lens is indeed invisible for any spp propagating on the metal surface .",
    "nanometers on normal incidence launched from the line g and a line source at point p ; b)magnetic field phase for a line source placed at the point p. c)magnetic field phase for a gaussian beam launched from the line g. d ) 3d view of b ) e ) 3d view of c ) . ]",
    "building on the previous perfect lens theory , we can use conformal transformations to bend the shape of the perfect lens into other geometries such as two concentric cylinders , see figure [ fig4](a ) .",
    "the objective is to follow pendry s proposal of a magnifying glass , and for this purpose the lens must be curved . the conformal transformation @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is known to preserve the solutions of laplace s equation and leaves the values of @xmath64 and @xmath12 unchanged .",
    "however , when one departs from the static case , the previous geometric transform leads to anisotropic heterogeneous permittivity and permeability tensors .    following the same algorithm as in the previous section",
    "we find that a possible design for a cylindrical perfect lens for spps ( avoiding spatially varying media outside the lens ) is given by    @xmath65    with @xmath21 for @xmath1 , @xmath23 for @xmath4 , and @xmath2 and @xmath25 as in ( [ drude ] ) .",
    "we show in panels ( b ) and ( d ) of figure [ fig4 ] some 3d finite element computations for a spp line source at a wavelength of @xmath26 nm , located inside the central region of the cylindrical lens .",
    "we also depict in panel ( c ) a 2d numerical simulation for comparison with the case of transverse electric waves ( whereby @xmath66 ) .",
    "we note that in such a configuration , the image is magnified .",
    "nanometers : ( a ) schematic diagram of the cylindrical lens ( the pink region is filled with spatially varying permittivity @xmath67 above and its drude metal counterpart below , the gold region is filled with negative permittivity @xmath68 and negative permittivity @xmath69 above and its drude metal counterpart below ; ( b ) 3d plot of the magnitude of the field ; ( c ) 2d computation for te waves ( with parameters of the top regions of a ) ; ( d ) top view of ( b ) . ]",
    "in conclusion , we have studied analytically and numerically the extension of optical space folding to the area of plasmonics .",
    "this requires anisotropic heterogeneous complementary media deduced from geometric transformations .",
    "focusing spp through a markedly enhanced control of their wave trajectories has been demonstrated .",
    "importantly , our analysis applies mutatis mutandis for a s - polarized spp ( interchanging the roles of permittivity and permeability ) . for illustrative purpose ,",
