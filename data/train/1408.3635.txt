    "our current understanding of tidal dissipation in solar - like stars suggests that the orbits of the shortest - period hot jupiters are rapidly decaying , driven by the darwin instability ( e.g. , rasio et al .",
    "how these giant planets reached their current orbits is still a matter of debate . in @xcite ( hereafter vr14 )",
    "we demonstrated that , including the effects of inertial wave dissipation @xcite , stellar tides can account for the observed distribution of misalignments between the stellar spin and the planetary orbital angular momentum ( e.g. , @xcite ) . moreover , orbital decay naturally explains the presence of hot jupiters with orbital separations @xmath0 less than _ twice _ the roche limit separation 2@xmath1 ( @xcite , hereafter vr14b ) .",
    "these results support a high - eccentricity migration scenario for the formation of hot jupiters @xcite .",
    "several previous studies have considered the fate of giant planets that reach @xmath1 . @xcite",
    "investigated stable mass transfer ( hereafter mt ) from a giant planet to its stellar host when the latter is still young and rapidly spinning , as one way of halting disk migration and producing a hot jupiter .",
    "@xcite studied the orbital expansion resulting from roche - lobe overflow ( hereafter rlo ) of young hot jupiters inside the magnetospheric cavity of a protoplanetary disk , to explain the absence of low - mass giant planets within @xmath20.03 au .",
    "many investigations have simply assumed that , whenever a planet reaches @xmath1 , it is quickly destroyed and its material accreted by the star @xcite .",
    "this could yield a detectable transient signal ( e.g. , @xcite ) and , if the star is spun up significantly through accretion @xcite , it could perhaps explain the claimed paucity of short - period planets around rapidly rotating stars @xcite .",
    "certainly current observations ( e.g. , table  1 in vr14b and references therein ) suggest that the host stars of hot jupiters close to @xmath1 are all slow rotators .    as a natural continuation of our previous work ( vr14 , vr14b ) ,",
    "we have used a standard binary mt model to investigate the evolution of a hot jupiter undergoing rlo . in",
    "particular we focus here on the evolution of the planetary mass and orbital separation during stable mt . indeed , for typical systems where a hot jupiter orbits a solar - like star",
    ", we expect the mt to be dynamically stable .",
    "based on @xcite the initial mass stream leaving the planet near the inner lagrange point l1 will not impact the surface of the star , so mt will proceed through an accretion disk .",
    "this is the standard case for close binary stars with a very small donor - to - accretor mass ratio , and it is indeed expected to be dynamically stable @xcite .",
    "this is also in agreement with @xcite s ( @xcite ) detailed study for wasp-12 .    as in our previous work",
    "we use full stellar evolution models and a detailed treatment of tidal dissipation . in what follows @xmath3 ,",
    "@xmath4 , and @xmath5 are the planetary mass , radius , and core mass , respectively .",
    "the stellar mass , radius , spin ( orbital ) frequency , and main - sequence lifetime are @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , and @xmath10 , respectively , while the orbital period is @xmath11 , and the mass ratio is @xmath12 .",
    "this study is partly motivated by the excess of _ kepler _  single - candidate systems with sizes less than a few earth radii ( @xmath13 ) and @xmath11 less than a few days that was seen in @xcite . they noted a significant excess of isolated hot super - earth- or sub - neptune - size planets , stating that they might be a small - planet analog of the hot jupiters .",

    "false positive signals are unlikely to have any impact on the statistical significance of this excess ( see @xcite for a discussion ) .    also shown in figure  [ fig : singlevsmultis ] is the distribution of @xmath11 and @xmath4 for _ kepler _  single - planet candidate systems ( generated through standard gaussian smoothing using silverman s rule ",
    "default options in mathematica ) .",
    "one can identify the island of hot jupiters centered near 3 days and 10 @xmath13 as well as the peak near 1 day and 1 @xmath13 .",
    "this excess population of low - mass single planets is the one we are trying to explain here , as these objects could be the remnants of hot jupiters that have lost their envelopes through rlo .    [ !",
    "our assumptions are based on the properties of observed hot jupiters close to @xmath1 ( vr14b ) .",
    "we consider circular orbits and assume that the star is slowly rotating ( @xmath18 ) and the stellar spin aligned with the orbital angular momentum ",
    "consistent with the majority of systems with solar - type stars .",
    "we assume the planet to be tidally locked .",
    "our models ( vr14 , vr14b ) can account for stellar wind mass loss and magnetic braking , but these mechanisms do not impact our results significantly and we omit them for simplicity . another mechanism that might affect the evolution of the tightest hot jupiters is photo - evaporation ( e.g. , the bright hd 209458b might be shedding mass through this mechanism , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite quoted a maximum mass - loss rate of @xmath19 and noted that a hot jupiter can not lose a significant fraction of its mass via photo - evaporation at any stage during its lifetime .",
    "we included this upper limit in our models before the envelope is completely lost and found that indeed most of the orbital evolution is not significantly affected .",
    "therefore , we do not consider photo - evaporation further here ( but see section  [ conclusions ] ) .",
    "we account for the host star evolution using mesa ( version 4798 , @xcite ) as in vr14 .",
    "our variables are @xmath0 , @xmath8 , @xmath3 ( donor ) and @xmath20 ( accretor ) , and their evolution is described by @xmath21    the subscripts `` tid '' , `` mt '' , and `` evol '' refer to tides , mt , and stellar evolution , respectively .",
    "the terms entering equation  ( [ eq : adottot ] ) can be derived from the system s total angular momentum , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the gravitational constant , as follows .",
    "let @xmath24 represent the fraction of mass lost by the planet and accreted onto the star via mt , then @xmath25    the total change in @xmath26 is given by @xmath27\\dot{m}_{\\rm pl , mt}+ \\frac{(\\dot{a}_{\\rm mt}+\\dot{a}_{\\rm tid})}{2a } , \\label{eq : jorbtotalderiv1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] or @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 represent the change in @xmath26 with respect to the system center of mass .",
    "following the standard binary star treatment ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we assume that the angular momentum carried onto the accretion disk is returned to the orbit via tidal torques ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , @xmath31 can be derived introducing the angular momentum parameter @xmath32 defined as @xmath33 from equations  ( [ eq : jorbtotalderiv1 ] ) and ( [ eq : jorbtotalderivwhereitislostfrom ] ) it follows that @xmath34 where we have set @xmath35 ( conservative mt , where @xmath32 is irrelevant ) for simplicity . in the limit of large @xmath36",
    "the final @xmath37 relation is independent on @xmath32 and @xmath24 ( i.e. , the details of the mt process ) , as they only affect the _ duration _ of the rlo phase . for @xmath38 , we treat stellar tides in the weak - friction approximation @xcite , as in vr14 and vr14b .",
    "specifically , we assume that the tidal perturbation is dissipated via eddy viscosity operating in the stellar convection zone ( equations  ( 1 ) , ( 4 ) , ( 6 ) , and ( 7 ) in vr14 ) .",
    "for the reduction in the efficiency of tides at high tidal forcing frequencies , we use the linear theory of @xcite , which is consistent with recent numerical results @xcite .",
    "as we consider only sub - synchronous configurations ( @xmath39 ) , tidal dissipation leads to orbital decay .",
    "the planetary mass evolution due to rlo is derived as in @xcite , where this phase begins when the planet fills its roche lobe ( of radius @xmath40 ) , and continues as long as @xmath41 . for large @xmath36 @xcite @xmath42 to determine @xmath43 ,",
    "a mass  radius relation is needed .",
    "detailed models suggest that the thermal timescale of typical hot jupiters is @xmath441myr ( e.g. , fig .  2 in @xcite ) , while the rlo timescales @xmath45 computed here are almost always @xmath46myr .",
    "therefore , we assume that throughout rlo the planet remains in thermal equilibrium ( but see section  [ conclusions ] ) .",
    "we have used two different approximations for the planet : a simple @xmath47 polytrope , corresponding to a constant radius independent of mass , and more realistic models with rocky cores , fitted to the results of @xcite and @xcite . specifically , we consider models with core masses @xmath48 , and  @xmath49 .    for the low envelope masses reached near the end of the rlo phase",
    "we also consider qualitatively the effects of strong irradiation , as modeled in detail by @xcite .",
    "note that the simple @xmath50 polytrope is actually a reasonably good approximation for large envelope masses , as detailed models show a nearly constant radius as a function of mass ( e.g. , fig .  3 in @xcite or fig .  8 in @xcite for the high - mass end )",

    "[ fig : massandradius_batygin ] ) leads to significant orbital expansion . for j3ei",
    "the orbit expands as long as mt dominates over tides .",
    "eventually , as the star approaches the end of the main sequence , the increase in @xmath7 and the dependence of @xmath38 on @xmath84 ( equations  ( 1 ) and ( 4 ) in vr14 ) cause tides to take over the mt and the system to evolve more rapidly .",
    "the evolution stops when stellar rlo begins ( denoted with `` @xmath85 '' ) .",

    "[ fig : evolutionexample ] .",
    "while most of the mass is lost within a few gyr , the orbital evolution slows down as the orbit expands ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : evolutionexample ] , right ) , and it eventually accelerates when tides dominate over mt .    varying the initial @xmath3 while using the same initial conditions and planetary models , the orbital evolution begins and ends at different @xmath11 , but it continues along the same tracks displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : radius_porb_koi_confirmed ] ( e.g. , starting with a higher @xmath3 , once @xmath3 drops to 2@xmath74 , the evolutionary tracks overlap ) .",
    "furthermore , varying @xmath20 between 0.5@xmath87 - 2@xmath87 ( typical for _ kepler_targets ) changes the duration of the various phases displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : radius_porb_koi_confirmed ] , but it does not affect the shape of the evolutionary tracks significantly . in our examples the evolution prior to rlo lasts only @xmath2 4myr , which may seem at odds with the observed hot jupiters close to @xmath1 .",
    "however , the evolutionary timescales can easily vary over several orders of magnitude depending both on the star under consideration as well as the assumed tidal efficiency .",
    "for instance , the pre - rlo phase for a host star of 0.5@xmath87 lasts several tens of myrs because of the smaller @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , debate still exists on whether the reduction in the effectiveness of tides at high tidal forcing frequencies should be described by a linear ( adopted here ) or quadratic prescription @xcite .",
    "the latter yields longer orbital evolution timescales , with a duration of the pre - rlo phase of @xmath83100myr ( @xmath8310gyr ) for a 1@xmath87 ( 0.5 @xmath87 ) host star .",
    "interestingly , some of the few known earth - size planets with observationally inferred masses ( e.g. , the intriguing kepler-78 , with @xmath88days , or kepler-98 at @xmath89days and @xmath90 ) lie along or very close to our evolutionary tracks .",
    "clearly , more mass measurements in this short orbital period and small mass regime would provide an important test of these ideas .",
    "our simple models naturally leads to planets similar in orbital period and mass to _ known _ systems hosting very hot sub - neptunes and super - earths .",
    "additionally , the wide range of masses and orbital periods covered by our evolutionary tracks suggest that , considering a variety of planetary interior models , the excess short - period , earth - sized planets seen in the _ kepler _  data @xcite could be explained as being the remnant planet cores from hot jupiters that went through rlo and lost their gaseous envelopes .",
    "one implication is that the number of systems that have ever had a hot jupiter is likely to be about 3 times larger than what one would infer directly from observations , since the number of single hot earths and super - earths in the _ kepler _  data is nearly twice the number of hot jupiters .",
    "if correct , these results suggest that many jovian planets have rocky cores and give a means to study the properties of those cores directly .",
    "core - less jupiters ( modeled here as simple @xmath50 polytropes ) would appear as very low - density planets at orbital periods of a few days and with sizes near their roche lobe .",
    "an absence of such planets would imply that most or all gas giants that form in systems capable of producing hot jupiters have rocky cores .",
    "observationally , if the excess hot earths comes from hot jupiters , then the host stars of these populations should have similar properties . specifically",
    ", their metallicities and masses should be somewhat higher than solar .",
    "depending on the details of the planetary interior , the orbital evolution timescales could be long enough that it might be possible to observe planets currently undergoing rlo .",
    "as shown by @xcite the resulting accretion disk could produce line absorption of stellar radiation , time - dependent obscuration of the starlight , and an earlier ingress for planetary transits .",
    "here we adopted simplified models for the planets , assuming thermal equilibrium throughout and using simple fits to published mass - radius relations .",
    "we also neglected photo - evaporation , even though it could play an important role in the evolution of highly irradiated super - earths and sub - neptunes ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "for example , it could naturally explain the density contrast observed in kepler-36 @xcite . if , near the end of the evolution , mass loss from the planet were significantly enhanced through photo - evaporation , this could lead to orbital expansion , potentially slowing down mt , or even completely halting rlo .",
    "magnetic fields and stellar winds , also ignored here , may well play a role in both enhancing photo - evaporation and in channeling or entraining the mt flow @xcite , questioning whether the mt really proceeds through an accretion disk , with all the angular momentum being returned to the orbit .",
    "finally , even though we assumed that the planet s spin remains tidally locked throughout the evolution , the synchronous rotation can not strictly be maintained as the orbit changes significantly .",
    "this could lead to significant tidal heating , potentially advancing the onset of rlo @xcite and enhancing mass loss .",
    "these various effects will have to be studied carefully in future work , which could combine the simple treatment of orbital evolution and tides introduced here with more detailed models of the planet ( e.g. , using mesa , as in @xcite ) .",
    "this approach , to use detailed models for the donor in mt calculations which are computed self - consistently as rlo proceeds , has been applied successfully for many years in calculations of interacting binary stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
