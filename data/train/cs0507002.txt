    "we are in the midst of a new wireless revolution , brought on by the adoption of wireless networks for consumer , military , scientific , and wireless applications .",
    "for example , the consumer potential is clearly evident in the exploding popularity of wireless lans and bluetooth - protocol devices .",
    "the military potential is also clear : wireless networks can be rapidly deployed , and the failure of individual nodes does not imply the failure of the network .",
    "scientific data - collection applications using wireless sensor networks are also gaining in numbers .",
    "these applications have sparked a renewed interest in network information theory . despite the recent progress ( see @xcite and references wherein ) , developing a unified theory for network information flow remains an elusive task .    in our work , we consider , perhaps , the most simplified scenario of wireless networks . our network is composed of only three nodes and limited by the half - duplex and total power constrains . despite this simplicity",
    ", this model encompasses many of the special cases that have been extensively studied in the literature .",
    "these special _ channels _ are induced by the traffic generated at the nodes and the requirements imposed on the network .",
    "more importantly , this model exposes the common features shared by these special cases and allows for constructing universal cooperation strategies that yield significant performance gains .",
    "in particular , we focus here on three special cases , namely 1 ) relay channel , 2 ) multicast channel , and 3 ) conference channel .",
    "these channels are defined rigorously in section  [ sec : general ] .",
    "we adopt a greedy framework for designing cooperation strategies and characterize the achievable rates of the proposed schemes .",
    "our analysis reveals the structural similarities of the proposed strategies , in the three special cases , and establishes the asymptotic optimality of such strategies in several cases .",
    "more specifically , our contributions can be summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "we propose a novel cooperation strategy for the relay channel with feedback .",
    "our scheme combines the benefits of both the decode - and - forward ( df ) and compress - and - forward ( cf ) strategies and avoids the idealistic assumptions adopted in earlier works .",
    "our analysis of the achievable rate of the proposed strategy reveals the diminishing gain of feedback in the asymptotic scenarios of low and large signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we further establish the sub - optimality of orthogonal cooperation strategies ( @xcite ) in this * half duplex * setting .",
    "2 .   inspired by the feedback strategy for the relay channel",
    ", we construct a greedy cooperation strategy for the multicast scenario .",
    "motivated by a greedy approach , we show that the _ weak _ receiver is led to help the _ strong _ receiver first . based on the same greedy motivation ,",
    "the strong user starts to assist the weak receiver after successfully decoding the transmitted codeword .",
    "we compute the corresponding achievable rate achieved by and use it to establish the significant gains offered by this strategy , as compared with the non - cooperative scenario .",
    "3 .   motivated by the sensor networks application",
    ", we identify the conference channel model as a special case of our general formulation . in this model ,",
    "the three nodes observe correlated date streams and every node wishes to communicate its observations to the other two nodes .",
    "our proposed cooperation strategy in this scenario consists of three stages of _ multicast with side information _",
    ", where the multicasting order is determined by a low complexity greedy scheduler . in every stage , we use a cooperation strategy obtained as a generalization of the greedy multicast approach .",
    "this strategy highlights the central role of cooperative source - channel coding in exploiting the side information available at the receivers . by contrasting the minimum energy required by the proposed strategy with the genie - aided and non - cooperative schemes ,",
    "we establish its superior performance .",
    "we identify the greedy principle as the basis for constructing efficient cooperation strategies in the three considered scenarios .",
    "careful consideration of other variants of the three node network reveals the fact that such principle carries over with slight modifications .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : general ] introduces our modelling assumptions and notation . in section  [ sec : relay ] , we present the new cooperation strategy for the wireless relay channel with _ realistic _ feedback and analyze its performance .",
    "building on the relay channel strategy , section  [ sec : multicast ] develops the greedy cooperation framework for the multi - cast channel .",
    "we devote section  [ sec : conference ] to the conference channel .",
    "finally , we offer some concluding remarks on section  [ sec : conclusion ] . to enhance the flow of the paper , all the proofs",
    "are collected in the appendices .",
    "figure  [ fig : conferencechannel ] illustrates a network consisting of three nodes each observing a different source . in the general case , the three sources can be correlated .",
    "nodes are interested in obtaining a subset or all the source variables at the other nodes . to achieve this goal , nodes are allowed to coordinate and exchange information over the wireless channel .",
    "mathematically , the three node wireless network studied in this paper consists of following elements :    1 .   the three sources @xmath0 , drawn i.i.d .  from certain known joint distribution @xmath1 over a * finite * set @xmath2 .",
    "we denote by @xmath3 the length-@xmath4 discrete source sequence @xmath5 at the @xmath6-th node . throughout the sequel , we use capital letters to refer to random variables and small letters for realizations .",
    "we consider the discrete - time _ additive white gaussian noise _ ( awgn ) channel . at time",
    "instant @xmath7 , node @xmath8 receives @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the transmitted signal by node-@xmath6 and @xmath11 is the channel coefficient from node @xmath6 to @xmath8 . to simplify the discussion ,",
    "we assume the channel coefficients are symmetric , i.e. , @xmath12 .",
    "these channel gains are assumed to be known _ a - priori _ at the three nodes .",
    "we also assume that the additive zero - mean gaussian noise is spatially and temporally white and has the same unit variance ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "we consider half - duplex nodes that can not transmit and receive _ simultaneously _ using the same degree of freedom . without loss of generality , we split the degrees of freedom available to each node in the temporal domain , so that , at each time instant @xmath7 , a node-@xmath6 can either transmit ( _ t - mode _ , @xmath14 ) or receive ( _ r - mode _ , @xmath15 ) , but never both . due to the half - duplex constraint , at any time instant ,",
    "the network nodes are divided into two groups : the t - mode nodes ( denoted by @xmath16 ) and the r - mode nodes ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "a partition @xmath18 is called a network state .",
    "4 .   let @xmath19 denote the average transmit power at the @xmath6-th node during the @xmath20 network state .",
    "we adopt a short - term power constraint such that the total power of all the t - mode nodes at any network state is limited to @xmath21 , that is , @xmath22 5 .",
    "we associate with node-@xmath6 an index set @xmath23 , such that @xmath24 indicates that node-@xmath6 is interested in obtaining @xmath25 from node-@xmath8 ( @xmath26 ) . 6 .   at node-@xmath6 , a causal joint source - channel encoder converts a length-@xmath4 block of source sequence into a length-@xmath27 codeword .",
    "the encoder output at time @xmath7 is allowed to depend on the received signal in the previous @xmath28 instants , i.e. , @xmath29 in the special case of a separate source - channel coding approach , the encoder decomposes into : * a source encoder @xmath30 maps @xmath3 into a node message @xmath31 , i.e. , @xmath32 , @xmath33 $ ] . *",
    "a channel encoder @xmath34 encodes the node message into a channel input sequence @xmath35 .",
    "7 .   at node-@xmath6 , decoder @xmath36 estimates the source variables indexed by @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the estimation of @xmath40 at node @xmath6 . in the case of a separate source - channel coding scheme ,",
    "decoder @xmath41 consists of the following : * a channel decoder @xmath42 , @xmath43 . * a source decoder @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "a decoding error is declared if any node fails to reconstruct its intended source variables correctly .",
    "thus , the * joint * error probability can be expressed as @xmath46 in the case of a separate coding scheme , the error probability reduces to @xmath47 9 .   an efficient cooperation strategy should strive to maximize the achievable rate given by @xmath48 , where @xmath27 is the minimum number of channel uses necessary to satisfy the network requirements . for a fixed @xmath49 ,",
    "this optimization is equivalent to minimizing the bandwidth expansion factor @xmath50 times the bandwidth of the source process . ] . due to a certain additive property ,",
    "using the bandwidth expansion factor will be more convenient in the conference channel scenario .",
    "a bandwidth expansion factor @xmath51 is said to be achievable if there exists a series of source - channel codes with @xmath52 but @xmath53 , such that @xmath54 . in the feedback - relay and multicast channel , minimizing the bandwidth expansion factor reduces to the more conventional concept of maximizing the rate given by @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the size of message set at the source node .",
    "10 . throughout the sequel we will use the shorthand notation",
    "@xmath57    the three - node network model encompasses many important network communication scenarios with a wide range of complexity , controlled by various configurations of the index sets and the sources . from this perspective",
    ", the relay channel represents the simplest situation where one node serves as the relay for the other source - destination pair , e.g. , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "if we enlarge the index set @xmath61 , meaning node-@xmath62 now is also interested in obtaining the source message , then the problem becomes the multicast channel .",
    "furthermore , if the two receivers ( node-@xmath62 and @xmath63 ) in the multicast case have additional observations , i.e. , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , which are correlated with the source variable @xmath66 , then the problem generalizes to the so - called multicast with side information scenario .",
    "we refer to the most complex scenario as the conference channel . in this scenario ,",
    "the three sources are correlated and every node attempts to reconstruct the other two sources , i.e. , @xmath67 . while it is easy to envision other variants of the three node network , we decide to limit ourselves to these special cases .",
    "this choice stems from our belief that other scenarios do not add further insights to our framework .",
    "for example , another variant of the feedback - relay channel would allow the relay to observe its own side information .",
    "careful consideration of this case , however , shows that our analysis in section  [ sec : relay ] extends to this case with only slight modifications .",
    "similarly , inspired by our modular approach for the conference channel , one can decompose the multiple - access channel with correlated sources into two stages of feedback - relay channels with side information .",
    "our formulation for the three node network allows for a more realistic investigation of the relay channel with feedback . in this scenario ,",
    "node-@xmath68 is designated as the source node , node-@xmath63 the destination , and node-@xmath62 the relay . since there is only one source in this case",
    ", one can easily see that maximizing the achievable rate @xmath69 from source to destination is equivalent to minimizing the bandwidth expansion factor . before proceeding to our scenario of interest ,",
    "we review briefly the available results on the awgn relay channel .    in a recent work @xcite , kramer _",
    "present a comprehensive overview of existing cooperation strategies , and the corresponding achievable rates , for full - duplex / half - duplex relay channels . in our work",
    ", we focus on two classes of cooperation strategies , namely 1 ) decode and forward ( df ) and 2 ) compress and forward ( cf ) strategies .    in df cooperation ,",
    "the relay node first decodes the source message and then starts aiding the destination node in decoding ( through a beamforming approach ) .",
    "more specifically , the transmission cycle is divided into two stages . in the first stage , which occupies a fraction @xmath70 of the total time",
    ", the source node sends common messages to both the relay and destination node .",
    "typically more information is sent in this stage than can the destination node decode .",
    "having successfully decoded the source message in this stage , the relay node uses the second stage to help the destination resolve its uncertainty about the transmitted codeword . during the second stage , a new message is also sent to the destination node from the source node , along with the information from the relay .",
    "when the source - relay link is very noisy , one can argue that requiring the relay node to decode the message before starting to help the destination may , in fact , adversely affect performance .",
    "the cf strategy avoids this drawback by asking the relay to `` compress '' its observations and send it to the destination . in this approach ,",
    "wyner - ziv source compression is employed by the relay to allow the destination node to obtain a ( noisy ) copy of the relay observations .",
    "similar to the df strategy , the transmission cycle is divided into two stages . during the first stage , both the relay and the destination listen to the source node .",
    "the relay then quantizes its observations and sends the quantized data to the destination node during the second stage . in general",
    ", the correlation between the relay observations and the destination observations can be exploited by the wyner - ziv coding to reduce the data rate at the relay node . during the second stage",
    ", new information is also sent by the source that further boosts the total throughput . here",
    "we omit the detailed proofs and refer the interested readers to the relevant works @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that the statement of the results allows for employing optimal power allocation policies to maximize the throughput .",
    "[ lem : df - cf ] the achievable rate of the df and cf strategies are given by @xmath71    @xmath72    where @xmath73 and @xmath74    we are now ready to present the cooperation strategy for the relay channel with feedback . in a nutshell ,",

    "the feedback stage lasts for a fraction @xmath78 of the cycle . in this stage",
    ", the relay listens to both the destination and the source .",
    "since the destination is not yet able to completely decode the source message , it sends to the relay node a wyner - ziv compressed version of its observations .",
    "we refer to the network state in this stage as @xmath79 . *",
    "the final stage lasts for a fraction @xmath80 of the cycle .",
    "having obtained source information , the relay is now able to help the destination node in decoding the source message .",
    "we refer to the network state in this stage as @xmath81 .",
    "the time - division parameters @xmath70 and @xmath82 control the relative duration of each network state . in particular",
    ", @xmath70 represents the total time when the relay node is in the receive mode .",
    "the feedback parameter @xmath82 controls the amount of feedback , i.e. , a @xmath83 fraction of the total relay listening time is dedicated to feedback .",
    "here , we stress that this formulation for a relay channel with feedback represents a `` realistic '' view that attempts to capture the constraints imposed by the wireless scenario ( as opposed to the _ ideal _ feedback assumed in existing works , e.g. , @xcite ) . the feedback considered here simply refers to transmission from the destination to relay over the same ( noisy ) wireless channel .",
    "using random coding arguments we obtain the following achievable rate for the proposed feedback scheme .",
    "[ lem : fb ] the achievable rate of the feedback scheme is given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 is the correlation between @xmath87 during state @xmath88 .",
    "in the proposed strategy , the total power constraint specializes to @xmath89    please refer to appendix  [ appex : fb ] .",
    "armed with lemmas  [ lem : df - cf ]  and  [ lem : fb ] , we can now contrast the performance of the df , cf , and fb strategies .",
    "our emphasis is to characterize the fundamental properties of the feedback scheme and quantify the gain offered by it under different assumptions on the channel gains and total power .",
    "the _ relay - off _ performance , i.e. , @xmath90 , serves as a lower bound on the achievable rate . in fact , the relay - off benchmark can be viewed as a special case of the three cooperative schemes .",
    "for example , setting @xmath91 and @xmath92 effectively reduces both df and cf strategies to the relay - off case .",
    "therefore , one can conceptually describe the order of containment of various schemes as `` relay - off @xmath93 df @xmath93 fb '' and `` relay - off @xmath93 cf '' . as for the performance",

    "i.e. , @xmath96 , enjoys an intuitive geometric interpretation : each expression within the min operator is a linear segment in the parameter @xmath97 $ ] ( see ) .",
    "hence , the optimal time @xmath70 , assuming the other variables remain fixed , can be simply determined by the intersection point of the two associated line segments , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : linebd ] . on the other hand , @xmath98 and @xmath99",
    "are characterized by more complicated expressions due to the dependency of @xmath100 and @xmath101 upon the time - division parameters .",

    "if , at the same time , the relay - destination link is stronger , then one may exploit feedback , i.e. , @xmath111 , to improve performance .",
    "the next result demonstrates the asymptotic optimality of the feedback scheme in the limit of large @xmath112 or @xmath113 .",

    "theorem  [ thm : relayhighp ] reveals the fact that strict feedback ( @xmath111 ) does not yield a gain in high power regime .",
    "the reason for this behavior can be traced back to the half - duplex constraint .",
    "when @xmath111 , the destination spends a fraction @xmath135 of time transmitting to the relay , which cuts off the time in which it would have been listening to the source in non - feedback schemes .",
    "such a time loss reduces the pre - log constant , which can not be compensated by the cooperative gain when p becomes large .    at this point",
    ", we wish to make a side comment contrasting the half - duplex constraint with orthogonal relay channels .",
    "the orthogonal cooperation framework was recently proposed as a practical way to address the half - duplex requirement @xcite . for simplicity , let s consider the non - feedback scenario and assume that the available bandwidth is @xmath136 hz , and hence , the total resources available to every node in network is @xmath137 real dimensions per second .",
    "the half - duplex constraint dictates * only * orthogonality at each node , where the available degrees of freedom , in the time - frequency plane , is splitted into two parts .",
    "the node uses the first part to receive and the second to transmit . in the orthogonal cooperation approach",
    ", however , one imposes orthogonality at the network level ( i.e. , no two nodes can now transmit in the same degree of freedom ) .",
    "in particular , the channel is split into two sub channels ( either in time domain  @xcite or frequency domain  @xcite ) , where the source uses one of the sub - channels to transmit information to the relay and destination , and the relay uses the other sub - channel to transmit to the destination .",
    "one can now see that this orthogonalization is sufficient but * not * necessary to satisfy the half - duplex constraint .",
    "figure  [ fig : orthogonal ] shows the orthogonal cooperation scheme which splits the channel in the time domain .",
    "when relay sends , it can use either the df or cf strategies . using the same argument as in the previous part ,",
    "one obtains the following achievable rate for the orthogonal df strategy scheme , @xmath138    it is now clear that @xmath139 is just a special case of @xmath96 where , for any @xmath70 , one can obtain the corresponding @xmath139 by setting @xmath140 in  .",
    "one can use the fact that @xmath140 is not necessarily the optimal power assignment that maximizes   to argue for the sub - optimality of the orthogonal df strategy ( i.e. , @xmath141 ) .",
    "more generally , the same argument can be used to establish the sub - optimality of any orthogonal cooperation strategy .",
    "we conclude this section with simulation results that validate our theoretical analysis .",
    "figure  [ fig : ratevsp ] reports the achievable rate of various schemes , when @xmath142 , @xmath143 , and @xmath144 .",
    "this corresponds to the case when the source - relay channel is a little better than the source - destination channel , and the relay - destination channel is quite good .",
    "this is the typical scenario when feedback results in a significant gain , as demonstrated in the figure . in the figure",
    ", we also see the sub - optimality of orthogonal cooperation strategies .",
    "figure  [ fig : ratevsh23 ] reports the achievable rates of various schemes , when @xmath142 , @xmath143 , and @xmath145 , as we vary the relay - destination channel gain @xmath113 .",
    "we can see that as the relay - destination channel becomes better , the advantage of feedback increases .",
    "figures  [ fig : relay_p2 ] ,  [ fig : relay_p001 ] ,  [ fig : relay_p100 ] illustrate regions in the @xmath146 plane ( @xmath143 ) corresponding to the best of the three strategies .",
    "it is seen that feedback can improve upon both df and cf strategies in certain operating regions . however , as predicted by our analysis , such gain diminishes when either @xmath147 or @xmath130 .",
    "overall , we can see that the proposed fb cooperation scheme combines the benefits of both the df and cf cooperation strategies , and hence , attains the union of the `` nice '' properties of the two strategies . on the other hand ,",
    "the gain offered by feedback seems to be limited to certain operating regions , as defined by the channel gains , and diminishes in either the low or high power regime .",
    "the relay channel , considered in the previous section , represents the simplest example of a three - node wireless network .",
    "a more sophisticated example can be obtained by requiring node-@xmath62 to decode the message generated at node-@xmath68 .",
    "this corresponds to the multicast scenario .",
    "similar to the relay scenario , we focus on maximizing the achievable rate from node-@xmath68 to both node-@xmath62 and @xmath63 , without any loss of generality .",
    "the half - duplex and total power constraints , adopted here , introduce an interesting design challenge .",
    "to illustrate the idea , suppose node-@xmath62 decides to help node-@xmath63 in decoding . in this case , not only does node-@xmath62 compete with the source node for transmit power , but it also sacrifices its listening time for the sake of helping node-@xmath63 .",
    "it is , therefore , not clear _ a - priori _ if the network would benefit from this cooperation . in the following , we answer this question in the affirmative and",
    "further propose a greedy cooperation strategy that enjoys several _ nice _ properties .",
    "in a recent work @xcite , the authors considered another variant of the multicast channel and established the benefits of receiver cooperation in this setup .",
    "the fundamental difference between the two scenarios is that , in @xcite , the authors assumed the existence of a dedicated link between the two receivers .",
    "this dedicated link was used by the _ strong _ receiver to help the _ weak _ receiver in decoding through a df strategy . as expected ,",
    "such a cooperation strategy was shown to strictly enlarge the achievable rate region @xcite . in our work",
    ", we consider a more representative model of the wireless network in which all communications take place over the same channel , subject to the half - duplex and total power constraints . despite these constraining assumptions ,",
    "we still demonstrate the significant gains offered by receiver cooperation .",
    "inspired by the feedback - relay channel , we further construct a greedy cooperation strategy that significantly outperforms the df scheme @xcite in many relevant scenarios .    in the non - cooperative scenario , both node-@xmath62 and node-@xmath63 will listen all the time , and hence , the achievable rate is given by @xmath148 due to the half - duplex constraint , time is valuable to both nodes , which makes them selfish and unwilling to help each other .",
    "careful consideration , however , reveals that such a _ greedy _ approach will lead the nodes to cooperate .",

    "moreover , finding the optimal cooperation strategy for the conference channel remains an elusive task .",
    "however , inspired by our greedy multicast strategy , we propose in the following a modular cooperation approach composed of three _ cooperative multicast with side information _ stages . in this scheme ,",
    "each node takes a turn to multicast its information to the other two nodes .",
    "the multicast problem here is more challenging than the scenario considered in section  [ sec : multicast ] due to the presence of correlated , and different , side information at the two receive nodes . as argued in the following section , in order to fully exploit this side information , one must adopt a cooperative source - channel coding approach in every multicast stage .",
    "furthermore , from one stage to the next , the side - information available at the different nodes changes .",
    "for instance , assuming the first stage is assigned to node-@xmath68 , then the side - information available at node-@xmath62 and @xmath63 will enlarge after the first stage to @xmath182 and @xmath183 , respectively . now , suppose node-@xmath62 is scheduled to multicast next , then the rate required by node-@xmath63 is now reduced to @xmath184 , thanks to the additional side - information @xmath66 .",
    "thus , one can see that the overall performance depends on the efficiency of the scheduling algorithm . in section  [ scheduler ] , we present a greedy scheduling algorithm that enjoys a low computational complexity and still achieves a near - optimal performance .",
    "the relay and multicast scenarios considered previously share the common feature of the presence of only one source @xmath66 . here , we expand our investigation of the multicast scenario by allowing the receive nodes to observe correlated , and possibly different , side information . to simplify the presentation , without sacrificing any generality , we assume that node-@xmath68 is the source and node-@xmath62 and @xmath63 are provided with the side information @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively . before presenting our greedy cooperation strategy , we study the non - cooperative scenario where the two receive nodes are not allowed to communicate .",
    "this investigation yields an upper bound on the bandwidth expansion factor achievable through cooperation .",
    "one can obtain a simple - minded transmission scheme by separating the source and channel coding components . in this approach , by appealing to the standard random binning argument @xcite , node-@xmath68 encodes the source sequence at the rate @xmath185 which allows both receivers to decode with the aid of their side - information .",
    "such a source code is then sent via the multicast channel assuming no receiver cooperation , which corresponds to a transmission rate @xmath186 .",
    "therefore , the above scheme would require @xmath187 channel uses per source symbol . in , the source code based on random binning",
    "reflects the worst - case scenario corresponding to the least correlated receiver node , i.e. , @xmath185 .",
    "a more efficient solution utilizes a _ nested binning _",
    "approach that combines the information required by the two receive nodes into a single hierarchical binning scheme . for the convenience of exposition , we assume that @xmath188 .",
    "a source sequence @xmath189 is randomly assigned to one of @xmath190 bins .",
    "this is the low - level indexing sufficient for node-@xmath62 to decode with side - information @xmath64 .",
    "these indices are then ( randomly ) divided into @xmath191 equal - sized groups , which corresponds to the random binning approach for node-@xmath63 .",
    "therefore , a source sequence @xmath189 is associated with an index - pair @xmath192 , where @xmath193 $ ] is the group index and @xmath194 $ ] identifies the bin index within a group .",
    "given side - information @xmath65 ( more correlated with the source ) , node-@xmath63 needs only the group index @xmath195 to recover the source sequence .",
    "but the low - level bin index is necessary for node-@xmath62 to decode . in summary ,",
    "the above nested binning scheme permits the source node to send @xmath192 to node-@xmath62 while only @xmath195 to node-@xmath63 .",
    "such a structured message is called the _ degraded information set _ in @xcite where @xmath195 is the `` common '' information for both receivers and @xmath196 the `` private '' information required by only one of the two receivers .",
    "the corresponding rate set can be written as @xmath197 , where @xmath198 is the rate associated with the private message for node-@xmath62 , @xmath199 is the rate associated with the common message , and node-@xmath63 receives no private information .",
    "this broadcast channel with a degraded message set has been studied in @xcite ( and references wherein ) .    [ them : broadwithdegra ] the capacity region of broadcast with degraded information set is the convex hull of the closure of all @xmath200 satisfying @xmath201 for some joint distribution @xmath202 .",
    "if the broadcast channel itself is degraded then the above three constraints can be simplified @xcite .",
    "consider the case where @xmath203 forms a markov chain .",
    "if the last constraint is satisfied ( in which case node-@xmath62 can decode both the private and common message ) , node-@xmath63 can also decode both parts of the source message although it does not need the private part . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath204 , the problem can be reduced to the conventional ( degraded ) broadcast setting where the rate @xmath198/@xmath199 is for node-@xmath62/@xmath63 and node-@xmath62 would automatically decode the message for the degraded node-@xmath63 .",
    "so , in this case , only the first two constraints are sufficient .",
    "the final step , in this approach , is to combine theorem  [ them : broadwithdegra ] with our nested binning approach . in this case , the rate set is given by @xmath205 and @xmath206 and we obtain the following result .    [",
    "lem : multicastsidedegraded ] for multicast with side - information , the achievable bandwidth expansion factor @xmath207 based on nested binning source coding and degraded information set broadcasting is given by    1 .   if @xmath208 , @xmath209 2 .",
    "if @xmath149 , @xmath210 for some @xmath211 .",
    "now , we are ready to describe our greedy cooperative source - channel coding approach . similar to the multicast scenario ,",
    "the receive nodes follow a greedy strategy to determine the order of decoding . due to the presence of side information , however , a more careful approach must be employed in choosing the _ strong _ receiver .",
    "to illustrate the idea , consider the following degenerate case , where @xmath212 , @xmath213 , and @xmath208 .",
    "although the channel between node-@xmath68 and node-@xmath62 is worse in this case , node-@xmath62 knows the information @xmath169 from the beginning because @xmath213 . so it can start to cooperate with node-@xmath68 from the very beginning .",
    "this toy example suggests that one should take the amount of side information available at each node into consideration . in our scheme , each node calculates the expected bandwidth expansion factor assuming no receiver cooperation , @xmath214 , where @xmath215 denotes the link capacity @xmath216 .",
    "the receive node with the smaller @xmath217 is deemed as the _ strong _ node , and hence , will decode first .",

    "after node-@xmath62 successfully decoding , with / without the additional help from node-@xmath63 , it coordinates with the source node to facilitate decoding at node-@xmath63 , in order to start the next round of multicast .    to better describe the cooperative source - channel coding , we consider first the simple case where node-@xmath63 does not help node-@xmath62 .",
    "we randomly bin the sequences @xmath169 into @xmath219 bins and denote the bin index by @xmath220 $ ] .",
    "we further denote by @xmath221 the mapping function @xmath222 .",
