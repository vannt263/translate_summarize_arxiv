    "spin effects in high energy fragmentation processes have attracted much attention recently [ see , e.g. , refs . [ 1 - 12 ] and the references given therein ] .",
    "one of the important issues is the study of spin transfer from the fragmenting quark to the produced hadrons .",
    "it can be studied by measuring the polarizations of the hadrons produced in the fragmentation of a polarized quark .",
    "hyperon polarization has been frequently used in this connection@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it has been pointed out@xcite that the vector meson polarization can also be used for this purpose since the polarization of a vector meson can also be studied easily in experiments .",
    "furthermore , compared with hyperon , the production rate of a vector meson is usually higher and the origin is simpler due to the much smaller contribution from the decay of heavier hadrons .",
    "this implies less theoretical uncertainties in calculations and better statistics in experiments .",
    "therefore , the study of polarization of the vector mesons may provide us important information to understand the role of spin in hadronic reactions .",
    "the polarization of a vector meson is described by the spin density matrix @xmath2 or its element @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 label the spin component along the quantization axis , usually the @xmath6-axis of the frame .",
    "the diagonal elements @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 for the unit - trace matrix are the relative intensities of meson spin component @xmath4 to take the values @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 respectively . in experiment ,",
    "@xmath8 can be measured from the angular distribution of its decay products and a deviation of @xmath8 from @xmath13 indicates spin alignment . in the helicity basis , i.e. , in the case that the @xmath6-axis is chosen as the moving direction of the vector meson , the matrix is usually called helicity density matrix and @xmath8 represents the probability of the vector meson to be in the helicity zero state .",
    "measurements have been carried out in different reactions@xcite in particular in @xmath0 annihilation at lep recently @xcite .",
    "the data@xcite show that @xmath8 is significantly larger than @xmath13 for vector mesons with large @xmath6 and increases with increasing @xmath6 ( here @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the momentum of the vector meson , @xmath16 is the total @xmath0 center of mass energy ) .",
    "this means that there exist a significant spin alignment for vector mesons in helicity frame in @xmath0 annihilation at the @xmath17 pole , and the effect is more significant for the large momentum fraction region .",
    "the simple statistic model@xcite based on spin counting gives the result of @xmath18 .",
    "a qcd - inspired model is given in ref .",
    "[ [ augustin80 ] ] , where a fast quark combines a soft anti - quark to form a vector meson and the soft anti - quark preferentially has the same helicity as the fast one .",
    "this model leads to @xmath19 .",
    "another model@xcite describes the production of vector meson through the channel @xmath20 , with the vector meson coupling to the quark like a vector current . in this case , the helicity - conserving vector current gives rise to @xmath21 .",
    "none of these predictions is consistent with the data@xcite .    in a recent paper@xcite ,",
    "we calculated the helicity density matrix of vector mesons inclusively produced in @xmath0 annihilation at @xmath17 pole by taking the spin of a vector meson which contains a fragmenting quark as the sum of the spin of the polarized fragmenting quark and that of the anti - quark created in the fragmentation process . by comparing the obtained results with the data@xcite",
    ", we showed that the experimental results for @xmath8 imply a significant polarization for the anti - quark which is created in the fragmentation process and combines with the fragmenting quark to form the vector meson .",
    "it should be polarized in the opposite direction as that of the fragmenting quark and the polarization can approximately be written as , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a constant ; @xmath24 is the polarization of the anti - quark in the moving direction of the fragmenting quark and @xmath25 is the longitudinal polarization of the fragmenting quark of flavor @xmath26 .",
    "the results of @xmath8 obtained from above relation are in good agreement with the data for different mesons .",
    "since the calculations are rather straight - forward , the relation given by eq . ( [ eq1 ] ) can be considered as a direct implication of the data@xcite in @xmath0 annihilation .",
    "it implies that there exists a spin interaction between the fragmenting quark and the anti - quark during the hadronization process",
    ". it should be interesting to extend the calculations to other processes and make further tests to see whether the relation is universal , in the sense that it is true for quark fragmentation in all different reactions .",
    "hence we made similar calculations for polarized lepton - nucleon deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) process and polarized @xmath1 collisions .",
    "the results for dis have been given in ref.[[xl02 ] ] .",
    "in this paper , we present the calculations and the results for high @xmath27 vector mesons in polarized @xmath1 collisions , where factorization theorem can be used so that fragmentation effects and other effects such as those from the structure functions can be studied separately .",
    "compared with those in the lepton - induced reactions such as @xmath0 annihilations and dis , the study of high @xmath27 vector mesons in @xmath1 collisions has the following properties .",
    "( 1 ) the involved hard scatterings are strong interaction processes rather than the electroweak processes in the lepton - induced reactions , so the corresponding cross section should in general be larger . furthermore , the luminosity of the incoming proton beams can in general be made higher than that for leptons .",
    "hence , the statistics in experiment can be better .",
    "( 2 ) not only longitudinally but also transversely polarized quarks can be produced , so that we can study the properties in both cases .",
    "( 3 ) there are many different hard subprocesses which contribute to the high @xmath27 hadron production .",
    "this makes the study more interesting and , at the same time , more complicated than those in lepton - induced reactions .",
    "for example , the gluon fragmentation is also involved here , which is unclear even for the unpolarized case .",
    "it is very important to know whether its contribution is significant in different kinematic regions .",
    "we will first make an estimation of it in next section using a monte carlo event generator and then present the calculation method of spin alignment of vector mesons in @xmath1 collisions . in section iii , we calculate the spin alignment of vector mesons with high @xmath27 in the helicity frame in @xmath1 collisions with one longitudinally polarized proton beam and present the results . in section iv , we extend the study to the the spin alignment of high @xmath27 vector mesons for the case that one proton beam is transversely polarized .",
    "finally , a short summary is given in section v.",
    "in this section , we first summarize the calculation method of spin alignment of vector mesons that was used in @xmath0 annihilation , and then extend it to the inclusive high @xmath27 vector meson production in longitudinally polarized @xmath1 collisions .",
    "the calculation method for vector mesons produced in @xmath0 annihilation has been presented in ref.[[xll01 ] ] .",
    "the main points are summarized as follows . for @xmath0 annihilation at a given energy ,",
    "we need to consider vector mesons produced in the fragmentation of a polarized initial quark @xmath28 of flavor @xmath26 and those of polarized initial anti - quark @xmath29 .",
    "the polarization of @xmath28 or @xmath29 is a given constant which can be calculated using the standard model for electroweak interaction . to calculate the spin density matrices of these vector mesons , we divide them into the following two groups and consider them separately : ( a ) those which contain the fragmenting quark @xmath28 ; ( b ) those which do nt contain the fragmenting quark .",
    "the spin density matrix @xmath30 for the vector meson @xmath31 is given by : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are respectively the average number and spin density matrix of the vector mesons from group ( a ) ; @xmath35 and @xmath36 are those from ( b ) ; @xmath37= @xmath38 + @xmath35 is the total number of vector mesons and @xmath6 is the momentum fraction of the initial quark s momentum carried off by the vector meson .",
    "the average numbers @xmath33 and @xmath35 are independent of the spin properties and can be calculated using an event generator based on a fragmentation model which gives a good description of the unpolarized data .",
    "we used generator @xmath39@xcite in our calculations .    in terms of the usually used cross section and fragmentation functions , eq.([eq2 ] )",
    "has the following form , @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the fragmentation functions of the initial quark @xmath43 ( anti - quark ) into the vector mesons of group ( a ) and ( b ) with momentum fraction @xmath6 respectively ; @xmath44 is the usual fragmentation function ; @xmath45 is the cross section of the process @xmath46 .",
    "we see that , @xmath47 is just the cross section of the production of the meson @xmath31 which contains the initial quark via the fragmentation of @xmath26-flavor quark in @xmath0 annihilation , i.e. , @xmath48 .",
    "it is proportional to the average number @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "the denominator is the total cross section of inclusive vector meson production , which corresponds to @xmath37 of eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "there are many different possibilities for the production of of the vector mesons in group ( b ) , we take them as unpolarized , i.e. , @xmath36=1/3 . for those vector mesons from group ( a ) , i.e. , those which contain @xmath28 and an anti - quark @xmath49 created in the fragmentation , the spin is taken as the sum of the spins of @xmath43 and @xmath49 .",
    "the polarization of @xmath43 is taken as the same as that before the fragmentation .",
    "then the spin density matrix @xmath34 can be calculated from the direct product of the spin density matrix @xmath50 for @xmath28 and @xmath51 for @xmath52 .",
    "transforming the direct product , @xmath53=@xmath50@xmath54@xmath55 , to the coupled basis @xmath56 ( where @xmath57=@xmath58+@xmath59 ) , we can obtain the spin density matrix of the vector meson @xmath34 . in the helicity frame of @xmath43 ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath6-axis is taken as the moving direction of @xmath43 , the density matrix of the vector meson of type ( a ) is given by , @xmath60 where @xmath25 is the longitudinal polarizations of @xmath28 and @xmath61 is the polarization vector of the anti - quark @xmath49 . hence , the 00-component of the density matrix takes the following simple form , @xmath62 in which there is only one unknown variable @xmath24 , the polarization of @xmath49 along the moving or polarization direction of @xmath43 .    using eqs .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) , we can determine @xmath24 in different cases by fitting the data@xcite in the @xmath0 annihilation at @xmath17 pole for the production of different vector mesons .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we found that@xcite , the data for different vector mesons can reasonably be fitted if we take the @xmath24 satisfying the relation given by eq.(1 ) .",
    "now , we insert eq.(1 ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) and obtain that@xcite , @xmath63 finally , from eqs .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) , we have @xmath64      now we come to the high @xmath27 vector meson production in polarized @xmath1 collisions .",
    "such vector mesons come mainly from the fragmentation of outgoing partons in the hard scattering subprocesses",
    ". the outgoing parton can be a gluon or a quark , and the cross section of gluon - involved subprocess is even larger than others .",
    "however , the gluon distribution and fragmentation functions are both poorly known yet , especially for the polarized case .",
    "fortunately , the momentum fractions carried by the gluons in a proton are usually very small , so the gluon contributions to very high @xmath27 hard scattering subprocesses are suppressed .",
    "in addition , it is known that the gluon fragmentation function is softer than the quark fragmentation function .",
    "consequently , for the final hadron production with high @xmath27 , the contribution from gluon fragmentation is much smaller than that from quark fragmentation@xcite . to see it numerically",
    ", we calculate these contributions using @xmath39 . in fig .",
    "[ meta132 ] , we show the results for inclusive @xmath65 production with @xmath27@xmath6613 gev at @xmath67=500 gev in @xmath1 collisions .",
    "we see that , at such high @xmath27 cutoff , the contribution of gluon fragmentation is indeed much smaller than that of quark fragmentation , especially for the large @xmath68 region ( @xmath68 is the pseudo - rapidity of the vector meson ) .",
    "thus , as we did in studying hyperon polarization in high @xmath27 jets@xcite , we neglect the contribution of polarized gluon fragmentation to the spin alignment of vector mesons , and consider only the contribution of polarized quark s fragmentation .    for quark fragmentation",
    ", we can use the same method of calculating spin alignment as that used in @xmath0 annihilation . to do it",
    ", we need to know the polarization of the outgoing quark in the hard subprocess .",
    "such quark is also longitudinally polarized when one proton beam is longitudinally polarized and its polarization can be calculated in pqcd .",
    "the obtained polarization can be written as , @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the longitudinal polarization transfer factor in the scattering from the incoming parton to the outgoing parton ; @xmath70 is only a function of @xmath71 which is defined as @xmath72 for the subprocess @xmath73 , where @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the four - momenta of the partons @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 respectively .",
    "@xmath70 has been calculated using pqcd and the leading order results can be found in many publications , for example , in ref.[[xll02 ] ] .",
    "we take the parton @xmath78 as the parton from the polarized proton beam , and the polarization of the incoming parton @xmath78 is given by @xmath82 , where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the helicity and unpolarized distribution functions at momentum fraction @xmath85 and scale @xmath86 . therefore , the longitudinal polarization @xmath87 is the function of variables @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath71 .",
    "since we are now discussing @xmath1 collisions with one polarized beam , it is clear that the outgoing quarks with positive momenta in @xmath6 direction have a much larger probability of being polarized than those with negative momenta when the positive axis of @xmath6 is taken as the direction of the incoming polarized proton .",
    "similar to that in @xmath0 annihilation , to calculate the spin density matrix of the high @xmath27 vector mesons in @xmath1 collisions , we also divide them into two groups ( a ) and ( b ) according to whether they contain an outgoing quark in the hard scattering and consider them separately .",
    "the difference is that , now the fragmenting quark is an outgoing quark in the hard scattering subprocesses and its polarization is not a constant .",
    "it depends on the origin of this quark and is given by eq.([polq7 ] ) . obviously , it is a function of @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath71 .",
    "hence , @xmath8 for vector mesons of group ( a ) should be also a function of @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath71 and it is given by , @xmath88    to obtain @xmath8 for vector mesons at a given pseudo - rapidity @xmath68 , we need to replace the products in eq.([eq3 ] ) with the corresponding convolutions , i.e. , @xmath89\\otimes \\sigma_{pp\\to q_fx } } { \\sum_f d_{v / f}(z_c)\\otimes\\sigma_{pp\\to q_fx } } \\label{eqpp01}\\ ] ] to write it more precisely , we have , @xmath90 } { \\int   d^2{p_{t}}\\sum_{abcd } \\int dx_a dx_b f_a(x_a,\\mu^2)f_b(x_b,\\mu^2 ) \\frac { d \\hat { \\sigma } } { d\\eta}(ab \\to cd ) d_{v / c}(z_c,\\mu^2 ) } } , \\label{rhopp}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the transverse momentum of the vector meson ; @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the unpolarized distribution functions of partons @xmath78 and @xmath79 in proton at the scale @xmath93 , @xmath85 and @xmath94 are the corresponding momentum fractions carried by @xmath78 and @xmath79 ; @xmath95 is the usual fragmentation function of parton @xmath80 into vector meson @xmath31 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 are those of parton @xmath80 into vector mesons of group ( a ) and ( b ) respectively , @xmath98 is the momentum fraction of parton @xmath80 carried by the produced @xmath31 ; @xmath99 is the cross section at the parton level .",
    "the cross section of the hard subprocess can be calculated using perturbative qcd .",
    "the summation in eq .",
    "( [ rhopp ] ) runs over all possible subprocesses .",
    "the fragmentation functions are independent of the spin properties and can be calculated using an available monte carlo event generator . in practice",
    ", we generate a @xmath1 collision event and then search for the produced vector meson @xmath31 .",
    "we then calculate its contribution to @xmath100 by tracing back its origin : if the vector meson @xmath31 belongs to group ( b ) , then its contribution to @xmath100 is given by @xmath101 .",
    "if it belongs to group ( a ) , we then need to further trace back the origin of the fragmenting quark to calculate its polarization @xmath102 using eq.([polq7 ] ) .",
    "we insert the @xmath102 into eq.([eq8 ] ) to get the contribution @xmath103 of such vector meson to @xmath100 . after running the program for sufficiently large number of events",
    ", we obtain the final @xmath100 . in terms of a mathematic formula",
    ", the calculation in this procedure is expressed as , @xmath104/ { n(\\eta ) } , \\label{eq11}\\ ] ] where @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the numbers of vector mesons of group ( a ) and ( b ) as a function of @xmath68 , and @xmath107 is the total number of vector mesons . the results for @xmath100 in longitudinally polarized @xmath1 collisions are presented in next section .",
    "using the method described in last section , we calculate the @xmath8 s for different vector mesons in @xmath1 collisions with one proton beam longitudinally polarized .",
    "we now summarize the obtained results in the following . using the generator @xmath39@xcite",
    ", we first calculate the different contributions to vector meson production , i.e. , those of group ( a ) and ( b ) . as an example",
    ", we show the results for @xmath108 at @xmath67=500 gev and @xmath27@xmath6613 gev in fig .",
    "[ korg ] . from these results",
    ", we can see clearly that , the decay contribution is indeed very small .",
    "the contribution of those containing an outgoing quark in the hard scattering subprocess is very high , even larger than @xmath109 for large @xmath68 region .",
    "the results of @xmath8 s for different vector mesons are shown in fig .",
    "[ vfig13 ] .",
    "we see that , the spin alignment for @xmath108 , @xmath110 and @xmath65 are significantly high .",
    "the obtained @xmath8 s for these mesons increase from 1/3 to about 0.45 with increasing @xmath68 .",
    "there is nearly no spin alignment in the negative @xmath68 region since the scattered quark moving in the negative @xmath6 direction is almost unpolarized .",
    "the spin alignment for @xmath111 is smaller in both positive and negative @xmath68 region , this is because @xmath81 quark fragmentation dominate @xmath111 production at high @xmath27 and the polarization of @xmath81 quark @xmath112 is smaller than that of @xmath113 quark @xmath114 .",
    "we can also make calculations for other vector mesons , such as @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 .",
    "however , since these mesons do not contain @xmath113 or @xmath81 valence quark , which dominate the high @xmath27 hadron production in @xmath1 collisions , their production rates at high @xmath27 are small .",
    "this makes the statistics much worse than those for @xmath108 , @xmath111 , @xmath110 and @xmath65 . for the same reason ,",
    "the @xmath118 quark distribution is much more important .",
    "hence , the spin alignment for these mesons are much more sensitive to the helicity distribution of the strange quark in nucleon , which is less precisely determined yet .",
    "it is thus not a good choice to study the spin transfer in fragmentation process by measuring the spin alignment of these mesons .",
    "but , it is possible to use them to study the helicity distribution of the strange sea in nucleon if they can be measured with good accuracy .",
    "when one of the proton beams is transversely polarized , the incoming quark @xmath78 for the elementary hard scattering process can also be transversely polarized in the same direction .",
    "its polarization @xmath119 is determined by the transversity distribution function@xcite @xmath120 and the unpolarized distribution function @xmath84 , i.e. , @xmath121 .",
    "there is no gluon transversity distribution at leading twist@xcite , thus the incoming gluon in the hard scattering is not transversely polarized , which is different from the longitudinally polarized case .",
    "the transverse polarization can also be transferred from the incoming quark to the outgoing quark in the hard scattering .",
    "the polarization direction of the outgoing quark is also transverse to the moving direction of the quark but is in general different from that of the incoming quark .",
    "both the magnitude and the direction of the polarization of the outgoing quark can be calculated@xcite using pqcd for the hard elementary process .",
    "the results are summarized in the following .",
    "we recall that , for a quark @xmath78 with transverse polarization @xmath119 , the spin density matrix @xmath122 in the helicity basis is given by , @xmath123 where @xmath117 is the angle between the polarization direction and the @xmath124 axis .",
    "the @xmath125-plane is perpendicular to the moving direction of the quark , which is taken as the @xmath6-direction ; and the @xmath124-axis is taken as the normal direction of the scattering plane .",
    "the spin density matrix of the outgoing quark in the helicity basis can be obtained from @xmath126 given in eq .",
    "( [ eqrho1 ] ) and the helicity amplitudes of the scattering .",
    "the result is given by@xcite , @xmath127 where @xmath128 is a real function of @xmath71 defined in section 2b for the scattering and is called the polarization transfer factor . @xmath128 for different subprocesses have been calculated using pqcd and can be found , for example , in ref.[[collins94 ] ] .    from eq .",
    "( [ eqrho2 ] ) , we see that the outgoing quark is also transversely polarized .",
    "the magnitude of the the polarization is given by @xmath129 , i.e , @xmath130 we see also that , the angle between the polarization direction and the @xmath124-axis remains the same before and after the scattering .",
    "more precisely , the polarization vector of the outgoing quark is in the plane transverse to the moving direction of the quark and the angle between the polarization direction and the normal of the scattering plane is the same as that for the incoming quark . in another word , the direction of transverse polarization of the incoming and that of the outgoing quark are related to each other by a rotation around the normal of the scattering plane , which changes the moving direction of the quark from the incoming to the outgoing direction .",
    "fig . 2 of ref.[[collins94 ] ] ) .",
    "we note that the direction of the polarization of the outgoing quark depends not only on the scattering angle but also on the azimuthal direction .",
    "in contrast , the magnitude of the polarization depends only on the scattering angle .",
    "the dependence is given by the corresponding spin transfer function @xmath128 , which is only a function of @xmath71 defined above .",
    "having seen that the outgoing quarks are also transversely polarized if the incoming protons are transversely polarized , we now discuss the spin alignment of the vector mesons produced in the fragmentation of such quarks .",
    "we recall that , the relation given in eq . ( [ eq1 ] ) is obtained for the fragmentation of the longitudinally polarized quarks by fitting the @xmath0 annihilation data@xcite .",
    "it shows that the anti - quark which combines the fragmenting quark to form the vector meson is polarized in the opposite direction as that of the fragmenting quark . to test whether the relation is in general true for the fragmentation of a longitudinally polarized quark in any high energy reactions",
    ", we extended the calculations of the spin alignment of vector mesons to other lepton - induced reactions in [ [ xl02 ] ] and longitudinally polarized @xmath1 collisions in last sections .",
    "now we further assume that the relation is also true for the fragmentation of a quark polarized in any direction , i.e , we extend the relation to , @xmath131 we use this relation to calculate the spin alignment of the vector mesons in transversely polarized @xmath1 collisions so that this extension can be tested in future experiments . the calculations are carried out in a way similar to that in the longitudinally polarized case .",
    "we now present the calculations and the results in the following two different frames .",
    "\\(1 ) in the helicity frame : in the helicity frame of the outgoing quark of the hard scattering , its spin density matrix is off - diagonal and is given by eq .",

    "@xmath136 \" denotes the helicity frame .",
    "hence , the @xmath137 for such vector mesons in the helicity basis is given by , @xmath138 we can see that , as can be expected , if we look only at the @xmath139-component of the spin density matrix , the result is independent of the azimuthal direction of the transverse polarization , i.e. independent of the angle @xmath117 .",
    "it depends only on the magnitude of the transverse polarization @xmath140 , thus on the variables @xmath141 and @xmath71 .",
    "we see also that @xmath142 is smaller than @xmath13 , which is different from the results in the longitudinally polarized case .",
    "this shows that , if the fragmenting quark is transversely polarized , the produced vector meson should have a larger probability to be in the helicity @xmath143 states .",
    "as long as there exists the contribution of the vector mesons of group ( a ) , the final results for @xmath144 in this frame should also be smaller than @xmath13 .",
    "we know from fig .",
    "2 that the contribution of the group ( a ) increase with increasing @xmath68 , so we expect a decreasing @xmath144 as @xmath68 increases for vector mesons such as @xmath108 and @xmath145 .",
    "it is significantly smaller than @xmath13 for large @xmath68 .",
    "hence , the measurements of @xmath144 of the vector mesons in transversely polarized @xmath1 collisions should give a good check of the extension of the relation of eq .",
    "( 1 ) to the transversely polarized case .",
    "\\(2 ) in the transversity frame : to compare with the results in the helicity frame for the longitudinally polarized case , we also calculate the spin alignment of the vector mesons in the transversely polarized case in the `` transversity frame '' . in this frame ,",
    "similar to the helicity frame for longitudinally polarized case , we take the ( transverse ) polarization direction of the fragmenting quark as the quantization axis . the spin density matrix of the outgoing quark and that of the anti - quark are both diagonal in this frame , and they are given by @xmath146 @xmath147 where the superscript ",

    "( [ eq14 ] ) .",
    "we also see that , the obtained @xmath158 given by eq.([eq15 ] ) is in general larger than @xmath13 .",
    "this means that , the probability for the produced vector mesons to be in the spin states which are transverse to the moving direction are relatively smaller .",
    "we see that , although the values of @xmath158 and @xmath159 are different , they represent the same physical meaning .",
    "we should note that , to measure @xmath160 in experiments , we need to determine the quantization axis in this frame . since quantization axis is chosen as the polarization direction of the quark before the fragmentation , it can be different for different vector mesons .",
    "the polarization direction is determined by eq.([eqrho2 ] ) . in practice ,",
    "we first find out the normal direction of the scattering plane and then determine the polarization direction according to the rules described below eq .",
    "( [ eqpqt ] ) .",

    "the moving direction of the fragmenting quark can be replaced by the thrust axis of the quark jet .",
    "inserting eqs .",
    "( [ eq14 ] ) and ( [ eq15 ] ) into eq.([eq11 ] ) , we can calculate @xmath161 for different vector mesons in the above two frames in @xmath1 collisions with one beam transversely polarized . for these calculations ,",
    "we first need to calculate @xmath140 using eq.([eqpqt ] ) .",
    "so far , the transversity distribution @xmath162 is not known yet . in order to get a feeling of how large the spin alignment can be",
    ", we make an estimation using the simple form for @xmath163 in the light - cone su(6 ) quark - spectator model@xcite as input . in this model , the @xmath163",
    "is given by , @xmath164{\\widetilde { m}}_s(x ) -\\frac{1}{6}d_v(x){\\widetilde { m}}_v(x);\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath165 where @xmath166 and @xmath167 are related to the melsh - wigner rotation , which can be calculated according to the procedure given in [ [ bqma98 ] ] .",
    "the obtained results of @xmath161 for different vector mesons at @xmath168 gev and @xmath169 gev in the helicity frame are shown in fig .",
    "[ vfigt13h ] and those in the transversity frame are shown in fig .",
    "[ vfigt13 ] . for comparison",
    ", we also show the results obtained by taking the upper limit of @xmath162 in soffer s inequality@xcite , @xmath170.\\ ] ] from these figures , we see that , in the helicity frame , the @xmath8 s of vector mesons are smaller than @xmath13 in the large @xmath68 region , but the effect is not very significant . in the transversity frame , however , the @xmath8 s of @xmath108 , @xmath110 and @xmath65 are larger than @xmath13 and increase to about 0.5 with increasing @xmath68 , which are similar to the results of longitudinally polarized case .",
    "however , the results of @xmath111 s @xmath8 in both frames are much near the unpolarized case of 1/3 .",
    "this is because , the @xmath81 quark fragmentation dominates the @xmath111 s production at high @xmath27 , and according to the soffer s inequality , @xmath171 should be small , since @xmath172 is negative for valence quark .",
    "as we mentioned above , the gluon is not transversely polarized , so it is much safer to assume that there is no contribution of gluon fragmentation to the spin alignment of vector mesons in transversely polarized @xmath1 collisions .",
    "therefore , the high @xmath27 cut which we invoked in longitudinally polarized case to ensure a small contribution of gluon fragmentation is unnecessary now . here",
    ", only a relative high @xmath27 cut is required to ensure the validity of pqcd .",
    "we therefore make also the calculations for @xmath173 gev at @xmath168 gev and the results are given in fig .",
    "[ vfigt8h ] and fig .",
    "[ vfigt8 ] .",
    "the results are much similar to those obtained in the case of higher @xmath27 cut @xmath169 gev .",
    "in summary , we calculate the spin alignment of vector mesons with high @xmath27 in high energy @xmath1 collisions with one longitudinally polarized beam by taking the spin of vector meson as the sum of the spin of the scattered quark and that of the secondary anti - quark produced in the fragmentation process . the results for different vector mesons at rhic energy are presented .",
    "these results show that there exist quite significant spin alignment for @xmath108 , @xmath110 and @xmath65 .",
    "we also study the spin alignment of vector mesons in the case that one of the proton beams is transversely polarized . using the same method as that in the longitudinally polarized case",
    ", we obtain the results in the helicity and the transversity frame .",
    "the results show that , in the large @xmath68 region , the @xmath8 s in the helicity frame are smaller than @xmath13 , while the @xmath8 s in the transversity frame are larger than @xmath13 . the magnitudes of the effect depend on the transversity distribution of the quark in proton .",
    "they are expected to be more significant in the large @xmath68 region .",
    "measurements of them can provide useful information for spin effects in strong interaction and the spin structure of nucleon .    0.3 cm we thank li shi - yuan , si zong - guo , xie qu - bing and other members in the theoretical particle physics group of shandong university for helpful discussions .",
