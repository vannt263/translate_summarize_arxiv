    "the relation between spectral statistics of a quantum system and its classical counterpart is one of the main achievements of quantum chaos .",
    "it is established that at the scale of the mean level density the spectral statistics of classically integrable systems are described by the poisson distribution @xcite and the spectral statistics of classically chaotic systems are close to the statistics of eigenvalues of standard random matrix ensembles depending only on the underlying symmetry @xcite . though these statements had not mathematically been proved in the full generality and there exist noticeable exceptions ( e.g. chaotic systems on constant negative curvature surfaces generated by arithmetic groups @xcite ) , these conjectures are widely accepted for generic quantum systems .",
    "much less is known when a system is not classically integrable or completely chaotic .",
    "an important example which we have in mind is the case of pseudo - integrable systems ( see e.g. @xcite ) represented by 2-dimensional polygonal billiards whose each angle is a rational multiple of @xmath0 .",
    "a typical classical trajectory in such models covers a 2-dimensional surface of a finite genus @xmath1 @xcite . for comparison",
    ", a trajectory of a 2-dimensional integrable model belongs to a 2-dimensional torus of genus 1 and a typical trajectory of a 2-dimensional chaotic system covers ergodically the whole 3-dimensional surface of constant energy .",
    "numerical calculations @xcite clearly demonstrated that the spectral statistics of pseudo - integrable billiards is not universal and depends on billiard angles .",
    "it appears that spectral statistics of such models has two characteristic features : a level repulsion at small distances and an exponential decrease of the nearest - neighbour distribution at large separations .",
    "this type of statistics ( called intermediate statistics ) has been observed for the first time in the numerical simulations of the anderson model at the point of metal - insulator transition @xcite and later in this context has been profoundly investigated ( see e.g. a recent review @xcite and references therein ) . unfortunately analytical progress in the investigation of intermediate statistics in pseudo - integrable systems is limited . in @xcite",
    "the level compressibility of certain pseudo - integrable billiards was computed analytically , thus confirming the intermediate character of their spectral statistics .",
    "the main difficulty in analytical treatment of 2-dimensional pseudo - integrable billiards is the strong diffraction on billiard corners with angles @xmath2 with integer @xmath3 .",
    "though there exists the exact sommerfeld s solution for the scattering on such angles @xcite , the diffraction coefficient is formally infinite along the optical boundaries so it is impossible to treat the multiple corner diffraction in perturbation series .",
    "a certain progress has been made in @xcite where it was found that the multiple diffraction along periodic orbit channels in pseudo - integrable systems forces the wave functions to tend to zero on the channel boundaries thus forming superscarring states observed recently in micro - wave experiments @xcite .",
    "the difficulties in analytical solution of pseudo - integrable billiards lead to the necessity of investigation of simpler models with similar features .",
    "a promising example is the quantization of interval exchange maps which are known to be the correct description of classical dynamics in pseudo - integrable systems @xcite , @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "the following classical parabolic map had been quantized @xmath4 here @xmath5 is a constant and @xmath6 is a certain function ( taken equal @xmath7 in @xcite ) . for rational @xmath8",
    "this map corresponds to the simplest interval exchange map of 2 intervals .",
    "after a straightforward generalization of the results of @xcite the @xmath9 unitary matrix associated with the above map has the form of the diagonal matrix @xmath10 with real @xmath11 multiplied by a constant unitary matrix @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) @xmath14 where @xmath15= \\frac{1-{\\rm e}^{2\\pi{\\rm i}\\alpha n}}{n(1-{\\rm e}^{2\\pi{\\rm i}(k - p+\\alpha n)/n})}\\;. \\label{mu}\\ ] ] the matrix @xmath12 depends on a parameter @xmath5 and the last equality are valid when @xmath16 is not an integer .",

    "the map ( [ map ] ) is only a parabolic map and methods developed in @xcite and in the present paper can not be directly applied .",
    "numerical calculations suggest that for diophantine @xmath5 the spectral statistics of the matrix ( [ matrix ] ) is very close to the standard statistics of the gaussian ensembles of random matrices @xcite .",

    "it appears that to get a well defined limit in this case it is necessary to consider increasing sequences of matrix dimensions , @xmath19 , such that the product of the numerator of @xmath5 times @xmath19 has a fixed residue modulo the denominator of @xmath5 @xmath36 in @xcite it was demonstrated that for a special sequence of matrix dimensions with @xmath37 eigenvalues of the matrix ( [ matrix ] ) , ( [ mu ] ) are described by the so - called semi - poisson statistics which has been proposed in @xcite as the simplest model of intermediate statistics .",
    "let @xmath38 be an ordered sequence of real numbers ( eigenvalues ) .",

    "from a mathematical point of view the semi - poisson statistics can be considered as a stochastic process with independent increments ( with gamma - distribution ) forming a convolution semigroup @xmath50 according to @xcite when the condition ( [ modulus ] ) is satisfied the spectral statistics of the matrix ( [ matrix ] ) tends for large @xmath19 to the semi - poisson distribution with the following integer and half integer values of @xmath44 depending on the denominator of @xmath8 and the symmetry of the map @xmath51 to compare numerical calculations with theoretical predictions it is often more precise to consider instead of the nearest - neighbour distribution , @xmath52 , ( as in fig .",
    "[ wiegner ] ) its integral @xmath53 which gives the relative number of levels when the distance between the nearest - neighbour eigenvalues is less than @xmath54 .",

    "@xcite ) . in our case the both matrices ,",
    "@xmath28 and @xmath68 are unitary and their eigenvalues lie on the unit circle : @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
