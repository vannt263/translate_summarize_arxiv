    "since the discovery of @xmath3 in 1985 @xcite and the following large scale synthesis of fullerenes , considerable effort has been devoted to use these molecules as building blocks for novel and more interesting materials .",
    "one of the most important attempts is to try to change their electronic and mechanical properties through doping . in recent years",
    "exohedrally and endohedrally doped fullerenes have been produced , with a variety of doping atoms and even small molecules . in the exohedral case , the foreign atoms ( or groups of atoms ) are outside , attached to the fullerene , as in the case of the superconducting fullerides . in the endohedral case",
    "the molecule encloses the strange element , isolating it from the outside .",
    "many possible applications , specially in medicine , have been envisaged using these new systems . a third approach to create fullerene - related compounds",
    "is to modify the fullerene itself through substitutional doping .",
    "this is expected to be easier if the dopant atom has a similar electronic configuration to that of carbon , but has been successfully performed with several elements , such as b , n , o and some transition metal atoms as fe , co , ni , rh and ir . at first glance ,",
    "substitutional doping with silicon should be also easy due to the similar electronic configuration of carbon and silicon",
    ". however , both atoms prefer quite different kinds of bonding .",
    "while carbon can form @xmath4 , and @xmath5 bonds , silicon strongly prefers the @xmath5 configuration , making silicon clusters to be generally in a three - dimensional arrangement .",
    "silicon doped and silicon coated fullerenes have been produced only very recently @xcite , starting either from an initially doped carbon - based material or from precursor pure carbon fullerenes interacting with a vapor of the doping element .",
    "both mass abundance spectroscopy and the analysis of the photofragmentation products of selected species show clearly that several carbon atoms can be substituted in the cage structure and also that silicon clusters can be adsorbed on its surface .    from the theoretical side , some semiempirical @xcite and ab - initio calculations",
    "@xcite have been performed to study the structure , stability and electronic properties of these new molecules . up to now the main way to infer the structure of the doped systems is through the study of their fragmentation and the analysis of the residual clusters with different compositions .",
    "for this reason , in the present work we attempt to model those fragmentation processes , using molecular dynamics simulations within a density functional based tight - binding model @xcite .",
    "this seems to be an adequate choice , as it takes into account the bonding characteristics of the two elements , carbon and silicon , being less time consuming than full ab - initio simulations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii we present the method used in the calculations , putting special emphasis on the different approximations used . in section iii we analize the results , first for substitutional doping and then for coated fullerenes",
    ". finally in section iv are our conclusions and comments .",
    "along this work we use a density functional based non orthogonal tight binding hamiltonian , that was developed and tried for different systems containing carbon and silicon atoms @xcite .    in this method",
    "the hamiltonian and overlap matrix elements were obtained from pseudo - atomic orbitals as a function of distance , in a parameter free way . in this sense",
    "it seems more satisfactory than the orthogonal tight - binding parametrization we previously developed for mixed systems @xcite .",
    "although only a minimal basis set is used , the method has been proved to be transferable , giving good results for clusters , surfaces and solids @xcite .",
    "it gives also a good description of some non - trivial low dimensional systems , as for example the reconstructed si and @xmath6sic surfaces @xcite , which is an indication that a reasonable description of the fullerenes when bonds break up should be obtained .",
    "the method uses only two center integrals and the total energy is written as the sum of a band - structure term and a repulsive term , this last one being parametrized also with experimental information . when performing the dynamical simulations at finite temperatures or obtaining the relaxed equilibrium structures ,",
    "the atoms are moved according to the hellmann - feynmann forces and the equations of motion are integrated using verlet s algorithm .",
    "the approach used here does not consider charge self - consistency to avoid unreasonably large simulation times and the introduction of a new set of parameters ( a hubbard type u and a madelung correction ) .",
    "the effect of this approximation is that charge transfers may be rather large and the fragments carry incorrect amount of net charges .",
    "semiempirical methods , like this one , should be used instead of an ab - initio calculation when this one makes the simulation too lengthy .",
    "it is worth mentioning that experiments are performed on single positively charged clusters , however the fragmentation of non - doped fullerenes , the succesive emission of @xmath0 molecules is correctly described by simulations with neutral molecules .",
    "for this reason we have used the same approximation in this case .",
    "nevertheless , we have also proved with a few examples that there is no statistical difference when using positive ions instead of neutral fullerenes if the same parameters are used .",
    "our previous ab - initio calculations @xcite also show that even in the case of si substituted ions , where the original fullerene cage is far more strongly perturbed than in the adsorbed case , we do not find very different geometries or energy gaps .",
    "we therefore do not expect the fragmentation results to differ in any important way between the neutral molecules and the positive ions , in both substitutional and coated cases .    before starting the simulations we checked that the structure , stability and electronic properties of the substituted fullerenes , that we studied previously with an ab - initio procedure @xcite , are correctly reproduced .",
    "in fact , the substituted fullerenes are also stable in this case and the energy ordering of the different isomers containing 2 , 3 and 6 carbon atoms substituted by silicon atoms is well reproduced , giving energy differences of the same order of magnitude .",
    "the energy differences obtained by the tight - binding method are not consistently higher or lower than the corresponding ab - initio ones .",
    "the two characteristic @xmath7 bond lengths in the fullerene cage are maintained in the relaxed substituted molecules and the lowest energy , when more than two silicon atoms are in the cage , is when they are nearest neighbors , so as to reduce the number of @xmath8 bonds .",
    "as in the ab - initio calculations , sometimes lower energy configurations present some weak bonds that could indicate the possible fragmentation paths . in the case of adsorbed silicon atoms , they form weakly bound clusters of silicon atoms on the surface of the fullerene molecule , with silicon atoms locating preferentialy in front of a hh ( hexagon - hexagon ) @xmath7 bonds and close to each other for cases with more than two adsorbed silicon atoms .    with respect to the electronic properties",
    "the tight - binding calculations give very similar values for the band - gaps but , as expected for a non self - consistent calculation , the charge transfers between different atoms are rather large , about double those of the ab - initio calculations , and the bond orders somewhat smaller .",
    "to simulate the fragmentation process we start from a relaxed molecule at 0 k and attribute a random velocity to each atom , with a maxwellian distribution corresponding to a high temperature .",
    "it assumes a very fast energy interchange between electronic and ionic degrees of freedom .",
    "this high initial ionic temperature approximation has been used previously to simulate the excitation produced by a femtosecond laser pulse @xcite . in these experiments , after being photoexcited the molecules do not collide before dissociation , so that it is quite reasonable to assume energy conservation during the fragmentation process . for pure fullerenes",
    "a kinetic energy corresponding to an initial temperature of about 12000 k @xcite was needed to produce the first breakup , that is , the first emission of a @xmath0 molecule , in a reasonable simulation time of tens of picoseconds .",
    "this time is of course much smaller than the experimental time of flight , but the experimental facts are correctly reproduced and the energies involved in reasonable agreement @xcite .",
    "the occupation of the electronic energy levels is time dependent , in each simulation step it corresponds to the fermi function of the corresponding instantaneous ionic temperature .",
    "however , due to the large energy gap of the fullerene molecule , this only allows for a small amount of electronic excitation to the antibonding states .",
    "the microcanonical molecular dynamics interchanges kinetic and potential energy so that after a few time steps the system equilibrates at about 3000 k in the silicon substituted cases and it vibrates for some picoseconds before breaking up , the initial energy converts quickly into molecular vibrations .    substituted fullerenes need lower initial temperatures to break up , and coated ones even lower , but the contribution of excited states is always quite small , especially once the systems achieve a stable temperature of 3000k or less . according to our previous ab - initio calculations and also to the present tight binding ones the si doped fullerenes do not have a much smaller energy gap than the unsubstituted molecule .",
    "for example it is 1.32 @xmath9 for @xmath10 and around 1 @xmath9 for the different isomers of @xmath11 ,    each simulation run in this work lasted between 20 and 30 ps , the time step being either 0.5 fs or 1fs .",
    "this assures a reasonable energy conservation for the whole simulation . due to the random nature of the initial conditions ,",
    "several examples were performed for each type of molecule and each initial temperature .",
    "the tight binding approximation is only valid when the leaving fragment is at a smaller distance than the cut off from the remaining molecule .",
    "we therefore report here only the first event observed in each simulation run , and attribute significance to the results up to that fragmentation instant .",
    "once the system separates into fragments , they do not interact with each other and therefore the tight - binding wavefunction does not make sense .",
    "after the high initial temperature is applied , between 6000 and 9000 k , the system achieves in less than one picosecond a temperature of around 3000 k due to the fast interconversion between kinetic and potential energy .",
    "= 6.6 cm    when more than one silicon atom is present , the results may differ for the different isomers . in some cases it is particularly easy for one silicon atom to become adsorbed outside of the carbon cage , in others",
    "it is not .",
    "the dynamics of three different isomers is studied for two substituted atoms , two different isomers in the case of three substitutions and only the lowest energy isomer is studied in the case of six substitutions .",
    "table 1 shows the results from all the simulations , totalling about 3300 ps , and the following general features can be observed :    \\1 ) the most frequent first event is the ejection of a @xmath0 molecule , usually located near a silicon atom .",
    "the first bond to break is one between a @xmath1 and a @xmath2 atom , which leaved an open chain of carbon atoms from which @xmath0 is removed .",
    "the @xmath1 atom rebonds quickly , as it strongly prefers tetrahedral coordination , while the carbon atoms are quite confortable in the chain structure @xmath12 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "\\2 ) another very frequent first event is that a @xmath1 substituted atom moves to an adsorbed position , from which it orbits around the fullerene cage .",
    "this adsorbed atom easily leaves the molecule , alone .",

    "other possible explanations for the above mentioned discrepancy between experimental and simulation results can be suggested .",
    "for example , the experimental laser excitation lasts nanoseconds , therefore allowing for sequential absorbtion of several photons , while the simulations only study fast femtosecond laser induced fragmentations .",
    "different time scale excitations could produce different fragments .    also , the simulations study essentialy the dynamics of the first fragmentation event but the experimental spectra may be more related to the energies of the final products .",
    "for example , starting from @xmath10 one may end up with @xmath22 + @xmath21 or with @xmath23 + @xmath0 .",
    "the first system is energetically favorable , but there possibly is high activation energy for that fragmentation process that does not allow us to see it within our simulation time and statistics .",
    "a few examples were tried in which some excited ( antibonding ) states of the molecule were artificially populated , so as to simulate the laser excitation in a different way , as proposed by other authors to study non - thermal fragmentation @xcite .",
    "however , no qualitatively different results were obtained if the excitation energy was small , although after conversion of the electronic energy to phonons , the activated phonons are those in which the silicon atoms vibrate more than the carbons , as both the homo and the lumo have large contributions from the silicon atoms . of course , when all the antibonding states are populated a spherically symmetric explosion occurrs .",
    "singly substituted @xmath24 systems were also studied in some cases , but again no new fragmentation processes were evident .",
    "we have also investigated the stable geometries and the dynamical behavior of @xmath3 coated with a small number ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 ) of @xmath1 atoms . in the equilibrium configurations",
    "our results show that the @xmath1 atoms are weakly bound to the fullerene surface , each @xmath1 atom being located in front of a hh @xmath7 bond and therefore bonded to two @xmath2 atoms , if the number of adsorbed @xmath1 atoms is less than three . for three adsorbed @xmath1 atoms ,",

    "have two @xmath2 neighbors , two have only one , and the other two have no @xmath2 neighbors .",
    "table 2 shows the average @xmath25 and @xmath8 bond lengths for the lowest energy isomers . in the case of @xmath26",
    "the @xmath1 atoms prefer to be far away from each other but in systems containing more than two @xmath1 atoms they prefer to be close to each other and located in front of a hexagon .",

    "respectively were achieved in less than a picosecond . at these temperatures",
    "no desorption is observed in systems with one or two @xmath1 atoms , but the adsorbed atoms move on the fullerene surface . in @xmath26",
    "the two @xmath1 atoms move independently and if by chance they collide and form a dimer , they easily separate again . as the number of adsorbed @xmath1 atoms increases , the desorption probability also increases .",

    "if it is less than three they tend to have more carbon than silicon neighbors , while for larger groups they form clusters and the number of neighbors of the same kind increases .",
    "= 6.6 cm    our simulation results agree with the experimental mass abundance results , that show a much larger probability of finding molecules with one , two or three adsorbed @xmath1 atoms than with four or more @xcite .",
    "another interesting result also shown in table 3 is that smaller adsorbed groups have a higher probability to dissociate and then desorb separately while four adsorbed @xmath1 atoms or more , tend to desorb as a unit ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . fig .",
    "5 shows @xmath32 first dissociating into @xmath20 and @xmath1 , later @xmath20 desorbing and the remaining @xmath1 adsorbed atom orbiting on the fullerene surface . in fig . 6",
    "another possibility is shown , two @xmath1 atoms from @xmath29 exchange their positions with two @xmath2 atoms and as a result they are incorporated into the fullerene cage . the two @xmath2 atoms evaporate and therefore the final system consists of @xmath15 plus an adsorbed @xmath1 atom moving on the surface .",
    "this suggests that @xmath1 substituted and adsorbed fullerenes may be interchangeable cases , with a greater posibility of substituted @xmath1 atoms becoming adsorbed ones .",
    "non orthogonal tight - binding calculations are found to reproduce quite well the ab - initio static structural and electronic results for @xmath1 doped fullerenes and for this reason the method seems adequate to study the fragmentation of these molecules by molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "we have used this method in the microcanonical ensemble and simulated the initial excitation by giving a high initial ionic temperature to the atoms .",
    "the first fragmentation event in @xmath1 substituted fullerenes shows , as expected , that the molecules break in those places where the bond orders are smaller , that is , in some @xmath25 or @xmath8 bonds .",
    "however , the most frequent first event is the ejection of a @xmath0 molecule and the second most probable event is that of a @xmath1 substituted atom going to an adsorbed position .    for @xmath1 coated fullerenes",
    "we show that adsorbed @xmath1 clusters containing more than three @xmath1 atoms are less stable and tend to desorb as a whole while smaller clusters may break into even smaller groups , remain adsorbed or exchange with @xmath2 atoms and become substituted fullerenes .    comparison with experimental results @xcite shows several points of agreement , such as the stability of substituted and coated fullerenes and the succesive ejection of @xmath0 molecules when excited .",
    "the difference in abundance between adsorbed clusters with three or more silicon atoms is also well reproduced by the simulations .",
    "the agreements obtained between experiments and the results of past and also of the present calculations suggest that they must contain some real information about the very beggining of the fragmentation process , on a very local scale where the total charge and the charge transfers are not the deciding factor . however , the stability of odd numbered molecules and fragments , and the fact that the @xmath21 molecule was never found as an ejected fragment in the simulations are differences with the experiments that remain to be understood .",
