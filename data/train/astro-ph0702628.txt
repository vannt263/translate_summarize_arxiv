    "when low- and intermediate mass stars enter the agb phase at the end of their lives , the mass - loss rate exceeds the nuclear burning rate and so dominates the subsequent evolution . in this process , a circumstellar envelope ( cse ) of gas and dust is formed which expands at a rate of about @xmath5km@xmath6 ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the agb mass loss undergoes variations on different time scales .",
    "the mass loss gradually increases over a time scale of several hundred thousands of years to reach a maximum on the tip of the thermally pulsing - agb @xcite .",
    "the pulsations of the central star cause variations over several hundreds of days .",
    "strong variations in the mass - loss rate , probably related to thermal pulses occurring every @xmath7-@xmath5 @xmath8yr @xcite , can lead to the formation of circumstellar detached shells .",
    "@xcite have recently studied 7 carbon stars with known detached molecular shells .",
    "they find that the shells are caused by periods of very intense mass loss ( @xmath9 ) and that these shells are running into a previous low mass - loss - rate agb wind .",
    "after the intense mass - losing period , the mass loss decreases to a few @xmath10 , on a time scale of a few thousand years .",
    "the question then arises if these types of mass - loss variations can be deduced from the sed . to answer this question",
    ", we modelled the sed of a carefully selected sample of nearby agb stars , post - agb stars and supergiants . for modelling purposes it proved desirable to obtain millimetre observations of the stars in our sample , as there are not many observations available in the literature in this wavelength range .",
    "still , a considerable part of the dust envelope is so cold that it emits its radiation at millimetre wavelengths , making these fluxes necessary to constrain the models for the seds .",
    "+ the outline of this article is as follows .",
    "first , the obtained fluxes at @xmath0 mm are presented .",
    "sect.[observations ] contains information on the sample selection , the observations with simba and the data reduction with mopsi .",
    "sect.[aperture ] is devoted to the aperture photometry . in sect.[models ] the constructed models for the seds are presented and the quality of these models and the indications for variable mass loss are discussed . in sect.[variations ] , the variability at @xmath11 mm is analysed on the basis of our observations .",
    "the conclusions are summarised in sect.[conclusions ] .",
    "the agb stars in the sample include m- and c - stars .",
    "we have also observed some post - agb stars and supergiants that are known to have circumstellar shells . to improve the sensitivity to very faint circumstellar emission , the selection was restricted to objects with low mm - background emission based on the _ iras _ 60 and @xmath12 m data ( typically the cirr3 flag , which is the total @xmath13 m sky surface brightness , @xmath14 ) and the sample was further restricted to stars within 1kpc ( see table [ results ] ) .",
    "there are a few exceptions , such as the unique f - type supergiant irc@xmath15 .",
    "the data were taken with the 37-channel hexagonal bolometer array simba installed at the 15-m sest telescope , during @xmath16 observation runs : 2002 september 510 , 2003 may 913 and 2003 july 1315 .",
    "the channels have a half power beam width ( hpbw ) of 24arcsec and two adjacent channels are separated by 44arcsec .",
    "the filter bandpass is centered on 1.2 mm or 250ghz and has a full width half max ( fwhm ) of 90ghz .",
    "simba works without a wobbling secondary mirror ; the maps were made with the fast - scanning technique .",
    "the scans were performed in azimuthal direction by moving the telescope at a speed of @xmath17 with a separation in azimuth of 8arcsec .",
    "the size of the scans varies between 500arcsec x 360arcsec and 600arcsec x 480arcsec .",
    "4 to 8 consecutive scans were made of each source .",
    "this procedure was repeated several times for each source during the observation runs .",
    "although simba has a hexagonal array design , there are still gaps in the spatial coverage . because the telescope is set up in horizontal coordinates , the scan direction on the sky changes with the hour angle . by assembling scans taken at different hour angles ,",
    "the gaps in the spatial coverage are reduced .",
    "of course the assembling of the different scans also increases the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the mopsi software was used to reduce the data .",
    "basically the procedure described in the section on mopsi in the simba user - manual @xcite was followed , but the reduction was further divided into 3 different steps . in the first step some fundamental operations like despiking , opacity correction and sky - noise reduction",
    "are performed on each of the individual scans .",
    "also , the 4 to 8 consecutive scans of each source are put together to form one map . in a second step ,",
    "the maps made during different nights are assembled .",
    "if the source was detected in the individual maps , the maps were recentered before the assembling . out of this map information",
    "is gained about the position of the source , which is used in the last step to define a proper baseline and to improve the sky - noise reduction .",
    "for the absolute calibration , scans were made of uranus , typically at the beginning and/or end of each observing night .",
    "the data reduction is basically the same as for the scientific sources , although a few steps were altered because uranus is a relatively strong and extended source .",
    "only low order baseline fits were used ( with an appropriate base range definition ) and neither despiking nor sky - noise reduction were carried out , as recommended in the manual .",
    "the flux of uranus at 250ghz was estimated with the subprogram ` planet ' in mopsi .",
    "table [ tabelvarianties ] gives the resulting calibration factors for the 3 observation runs .",
    "k , amc @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22k , @xmath23 between @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath26 between @xmath25 and @xmath27 .",
    "the upper figure shows the photometric data ( asterisk ) and the model ( full line ) .",
    "error - bars are shown , but most of the time they fall within the symbols .",
    "a reversed triangle represents an upper limit .",
