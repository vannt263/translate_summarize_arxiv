    "recently a renormalizable theory of gravity in 3 + 1 dimensions was proposed by hoava , inspired from the lifshitz theory in solid state physics , now known as hoava - lifshitz(hl ) theory@xcite .",
    "the theory is a potential candidate of quantum field theory of gravity .",
    "it assumes a lifshitz - like anisotropic scaling between space and time at short distances , characterized by a dynamical critical exponent z = 3 and thus breaking the lorentz invariance .",
    "while in the ir limit it flows to z = 1 , retrieving the einstein s general relativity(gr ) .",
    "the discussions on the consequences of theory are going on@xcite . as a new theory , it is interesting to investigate its various aspects in parallel . since the theory has the same newtonian and post newtonian corrections as those of gr ,",
    "systems of strong gravity , like black holes , are needed to get observable deviation from the standard gr .",
    "various black hole solutions are found in hl theory@xcite of which one with asymptotically flat minkowski spacetime is the ks black hole obtained by applying deformation in the original theory@xcite .",
    "various aspects of ks black hole were explored in the past@xcite .",
    "perturbation of black hole is the best way to study the properties of these exotic objects .",
    "as it is well established , the evolution of perturbations in black hole space times involves three stages@xcite .",
    "the first one is an initial response containing the information of the initial form of the original wave field followed by a region dominated by damped oscillation of the field called quasinormal modes , which depends entirely on the background black hole spacetimes .",
    "finally the field decays at late time as a power - law fall off of the field .",
    "qnms play an important role in astrophysical processes involving black holes .",
    "these interests are associated with their relevance in gravitational wave analysis@xcite .",
    "apart from the observational interest of detection of quasinormal ringing by gravitational wave detectors@xcite , study of qnm of ads black holes are of particular interests in the study of ads / cft correspondence@xcite .",
    "it was conjectured that a large static black hole in ads space corresponds to a thermal state in conformal field theory ( cft ) .",
    "the fundamental link between qnms of a large ads black hole and the dual field theory were shown in the work of horowitz who computed the qnms of ads black holes@xcite .",
    "motivated by this , a series of studies on the qnms in asymptotically ads backgrounds were done for various fields and dimensions@xcite .",
    "see ref.@xcite for a recent review of qnms of the black hole .",
    "the late - time relaxation of field perturbation is also an interesting topic of study since it reveals the actual physical mechanism by which a perturbed black hole sheds its hairs .",
    "it was first demonstrated by price that in the background of the schwarzschild spacetime the massless neutral field at late time dies off as @xmath1 or @xmath2 depending on the initial conditions and the multipole order @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the evolution of field and the spectra of qnms may be different in various theories of gravity and would help us to distinguish these theories",
    ".    dynamical evolution of scalar field in horava black hole spacetimes is studied using horowitz - hubeny approach@xcite .",
    "the spectrum of entropy / area is discussed from the viewpoint of qnms of scalar field in hl gravity@xcite .",
    "qnms of various fields around ks black hole spacetime were calculated using wkb method@xcite . in earlier",
    "work@xcite we have studied time evolution of scalar field using the time domain integration method@xcite . a noticeable deviation of the evolution behavior of scalar field in the ringdown region from the standard schwarzschild black hole was found .",
    "however the late time evolution of field fails to show any distinction from the schwarzschild case .",
    "the late time behavior of massless scalar field depends only on the multipole order @xmath3 and decays as @xmath4 .",
    "where as massive field in the intermediate range the decays as @xmath5 , but in the asymptotic late time the decay is dominated by @xmath6 tail .",
    "it is interesting to see how various other field perturbations decay in ks black hole spacetime . in this paper",
    "we study the evolution of electromagnetic and massless dirac fields in the ks black hole spacetime and probe the signature of the now theory by comparing the present results with those of the standard theory of gr .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec2 ] we derive the radial wave equation for various field perturbations around ks black hole and discuss the numerical method used . in sec.[sec3 ]",
    "the evolution of electromagnetic and massless dirac field are studied using the method of time domain integration and the qnms are evaluated and the results are discussed in sec.[sec4 ] .",
    "the ir vacuum of pure hl gravity is found to be anti - de sitter@xcite .",
    "even though hl gravity could recover gr in ir at the action level for a particular value of the parameter @xmath7 , there found a significant difference between these black hole solutions and the usual schwarzschild ads solution .",
    "the asymptotic fall - off of the metric for these black hole solutions is much slower than that of usual schwarzschild ads black holes in gr .",
    "meanwhile kehagias and sfetsos@xcite could find a black hole solution in asymptotically flat minkowski spacetimes by applying deformation in hl theory by adding a term proportional to the ricci scalar of three - geometry , @xmath8 while the cosmological constant @xmath9 .",
    "this will not alter the uv properties of the theory but it does the ir ones leading to minkowski vacuum analogous to schwarzschild spacetime in gr .",
