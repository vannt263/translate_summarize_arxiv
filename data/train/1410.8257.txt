    "based on recent results of chen - fukushima - rhode @xcite on chordal komatu - loewner ( kl ) equation and following the lines briefly laid by r. o. bauer and r. m. friedrich @xcite , we show that , for a corresponding evolution in a standard slit domain @xmath38 , the possible candidates of the driving processes are given by the solution @xmath13 of a special markov type stochastic differential equation whose diffusion and drift coefficients are homogeneous function of degree @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively . here",
