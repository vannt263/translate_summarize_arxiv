    "glassy phases of fermions have long been predicted to exist in coulomb frustrated semiconductors , so - called electron- or coulomb glasses @xcite ; in our case , the fermionic atoms play the role of the electrons in these earlier studies . in these electronic systems frustration results naturally from a competition between long range coulomb repulsions and the random positions and energies of impurity sites . while the former favor a regular density pattern , such as in a wigner crystal , the latter disrupt this order and provoke a non - crystalline density order .",
