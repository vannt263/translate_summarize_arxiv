    "stellar mass black holes accreting at or below @xmath5 are found in the `` low  hard '' state ( mcclintock & remillard 2005 ) .",
    "this state is typified by a hard , power - law x - ray spectrum ( @xmath61.41.7 ) , band - limited x - ray noise and high fractional variability ( sometimes low  frequency quasi - periodic oscillations , or qpos , are observed ) , and steady jet production that has been imaged in at least one case ( for reviews , see mcclintock & remillard 2005 and fender 2005 ) .",

    "the properties of the thermal emission from the accretion disk and the width of a relativistic fe  k emission line reveal that the inner disk in gx  339@xmath04 is likely not radially truncated , in contrast to some models for the inner accretion flow and jet production in this regime .",
    "the moderate column density along the line of sight to gx  339@xmath04 ( @xmath7 ) enabled the study of disk emission below 12  kev .",

    "the hard power - law spectrum observed with the _ swift_/xrt ( morris et al .",
    "2005 ) and the detection of a 0.6  hz qpo in pointed _ rxte _ observations are characteristic of the low  hard state ( morgan et al.2005 ) .",
    "swift j1753.5@xmath00127 was detected in radio observations made with merlin at a flux density of 2.1 mjy at 1.7 ghz ( fender , garrington , & muxlow 2005 ) , likely indicating compact jet activity .",

    "the initial part of the outburst followed a fast - rise , exponential - decay profile over approximately 100 days , peaking at 0.2  crab .",
    "thereafter , the source has been persistently active at a low flux level ( approximately 15 millicrab ) .    to test whether or not the results from gx  339@xmath04 hold at lower factions of the eddington limit , we requested a joint _ xmm - newton _ and _ rxte _ observation of the stellar - mass black hole candidate swift j1753.5@xmath00127 .",

    "inspection of lightcurves made from the       data revealed no evidence of background flaring , and the entire 42  ksec was used to generate epic - pn spectra .",

    "this observation was reduced using the packages and tools available in heasoft version 6.0 . after standard screening ( e.g. , against saa intervals ) ,",
    "net pca and hexte exposures of 2.3  ksec and 0.8  ksec were obtained .",

    "background spectra were made using the ftool `` pcabackest '' using the latest `` bright source '' model .",

    "all spectra considered in this paper were grouped to require at least 10 counts per bin using the ftool `` grppha '' to ensure valid results using @xmath11 statistical analysis .",
    "the spectra were analyzed using xspec version 11.3.2 ( arnaud & dorman 2000 ) .",

    "similarly , fits to the pcu-2 and hexte - b spectra were restricted to the 2.825.0  kev and 20.0100.0  kev bands , respectively .",
    "all of the error measurements reported in this work are 90% confidence errors , obtained by allowing all fit parameters to vary simultaneously .",
    "using standard ftools , we made fast fourier transforms of the _ rxte _ lightcurves of swift j1753.5@xmath00127 taken in pca event modes .",
    "the resulting power spectra show strong , band - limited variability that is typical of the low  hard state in accreting black holes .",
    "the rms noise amplitude in the 0.01100  hz band is 30% .",
    "no qpos were detected in this observation .",
    "initial spectral fits were jointly made to the _ rxte _ pca and hexte - b spectra with a simple absorbed power - law model .",
    "a normalizing constant was allowed to vary between the spectra , and the column density was fixed at the expected value ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "this fit gave a power - law index of @xmath13 , and was in fact a formally acceptable result : @xmath14 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "_ rxte _ is not sensitive to variations in low column densities , given that its effective lower energy threshold is 3  kev .",
    "we note that variations in the column density as large as a factor of 2 only produced changes in the power - law index within the error range quoted above , and also resulted in statistically acceptable fits . the power - law index measured with _ rxte _ , then , is a constraint robust against plausible variations in the absorbing column .",
    "we next made fits to the epic - pn spectrum , using a simple power - law with the column density fixed at @xmath9 .",
    "this model yielded an unacceptable fit ( @xmath15 ) and strong residuals below 3  kev in the data / model ratio .",
    "we next allowed the column density to vary ; this step yielded an improved but unacceptable fit ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the addition of a disk component to this model yields significantly improved fits . with the addition of a disk component ,",
    "the following parameters are obtained @xmath17 , @xmath18  kev , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ( consistent with _ rxte _ ) , and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the soft excess in this spectrum is shown in figure 2 , and the total fit is shown in figure 3 . the disk component is required at more than the 8@xmath2 level of confidence , as determined by an f test .",
    "this two - component model gives an unabsorbed flux of @xmath23 ( 0.5 - 10.0  kev ) and a luminosity of @xmath24 ( or @xmath25 ) .",
    "of importance is the radius of the inner disk ; the normalization gives a radius of @xmath26  km ,       or @xmath27 ( where @xmath28 ) .    for the disk blackbody radius",
    "given above , @xmath29 for @xmath30 at 8.5  kpc , and for @xmath31 ( assuming @xmath32 ) assuming @xmath33kpc ( see below ) .",
    "at such high inclinations , eclipses ( not yet reported ) would be expected . for inclinations greater than @xmath34 , @xmath35 would nominally hold for @xmath36  kpc assuming @xmath32 , or for @xmath37  kpc assuming @xmath38 .",
    "however , it is likely that swift  j1753.5@xmath00127 is closer than 8.5  kpc , making it even more likely that the disk is close to the black hole . of the 18 dynamically - confirmed black hole binaries in the milky way",
    ", only one may be as distant as 20  kpc ( gs 1354@xmath064 , casares et al .",
    "2004 ) and only one other is more distant than 8.5  kpc ( grs  1915@xmath39105 , e.g. zdziarski 2005 ) .",
    "torres et al .",
    "( 2005 ) report @xmath4014.8 on 11 july 2006 . on that day ,",
    "an observation with the _",
    "rxte_/pca gives a flux of @xmath41  erg / s ( 2.8 - 12.0 kev ) , assuming a @xmath42 power - law spectrum .",
    "russel et al .  ( 2006 ) have recently found an empirical relation between optical / ir luminosity and x - ray luminosity : @xmath43 .",
    "given the observed fluxes and a reddening of 0.19 for @xmath12 , this relation implies a distance of 2.9  kpc to swift  j1753.5@xmath00127 .",
    "thus , the fit above implies that the accretion disk in swift  j1753.5@xmath00127 is likely sitting at or near to the innermost stable circular orbit , for a broad range of system parameters .",
    "apart from uncertainties in distance , black hole mass , and inclination , the choice of hard component model , disk model , and radiative transfer through a disk atmosphere can all act to distort the observed disk parameters .",
    "for instance , zimmerman et al .  (",
    "2005 ) show that enforcing a zero - torque inner boundary condition can drive estimates of the inner radius values smaller by a factor of @xmath442 , relative to the diskbb model .",
    "shimura & takahara ( 1995 ) suggest that radiative transfer may act to give an inferred inner disk radius that is too small by a factor of @xmath45 ; merloni , fabian , & ross ( 2000 ) suggest this factor may be as high as @xmath46 in some cases .",
    "torque conditions and radiative transfer may partially cancel out , but represent important additional uncertainties .",
    "in order to establish the nature of the disk as robustly as possible , we jointly fit the epic - pn , pcu-2 , and hexte - b spectra with several continuum models . for each model fit to the data ,",
    "an overall normalizing constant was allowed to float between the spectra .",
    "we employed three different disk models : `` diskbb '' ( which assumes maximal inner torque ) , `` ezdiskbb '' ( which assumes zero inner torque ) , and `` diskpn '' ( which assumes zero inner torque , and a pseudo - newtonian inner potential ) . for each disk model , we employed three different models for the hard component : a simple power - law , a hot optically  thin comptonizing corona , and a cool optically  thick comptonizing corona . the parameters obtained with these models are listed in table 1 .",
    "each of these models suggests that the disk in swift j1753.5@xmath00127 extended close to the innermost stable circular orbit during our observations , for plausible ranges of source distance , inner disk inclination , and black hole mass .",
    "the implication that the disk extends close to the black hole in swift j1753.5@xmath00127 is not strongly model - dependent .",
    "it is important to note that the models with a low coronal electron temperature are significantly worse than the others ; they fail to produce the hard flux required to fit the hexte - b spectrum .",
    "if we assume that a disk temperature of @xmath47 1.02.0  kev is typical for a stellar - mass black hole accreting at its eddington limit ( e.g. , mcclintock & remillard 2005 ) , the range of temperatures implied by our fits is consistent with the theoretical expectation that @xmath48 in standard disks around black holes ( see , e.g. , frank , king , & raine 2002 ) .",
    "this theoretical consistency indicates that the observed soft component is a simple accretion disk continuum spectrum .",
    "an independent observational constraint on the inner disk radius would have been possible , if a strong relativistic fe  k emission line like that in gx  339@xmath04 had been detected . for a broad range of disk inclinations , a relativistic `` laor '' line consistent with moderate black hole spin with an equivalent width of 60  ev",
    "can not be ruled out .",
    "this line strength would correspond to a reflection fraction of 0.3 for a disk with low ionization ( george & fabian 1991 ) , comparable to the reflection constraints reported in stellar - mass black holes in brighter phases of the low  hard state ( e.g. , miller et al .",
    "2006 ) . a strong line ( 200300  ev ) like that detected in gx  339@xmath04 ( miller et al .",
    "2006 ) is ruled - out in swift  j1753.5@xmath00127 .",
    "spectral and timing analysis of swift  j1753.5@xmath00127 reveal that the source was in the low ",
    "hard state when observed simultaneously with _ xmm - newton _ and _ rxte _ in march 2006 .",
    "fits to the _ xmm - newton_/epic - pn spectrum reveal clear evidence for an accretion disk which likely extends close to the innermost stable circular orbit around the black hole .",
    "this result confirms prior results based on an _ xmm - newton _ and _ rxte _ observations of the stellar - mass black hole gx  339@xmath04 ( miller et al .  2006 ) and _ asca _ observations of cygnus x-1 ( miller et al .",
    "2006 ; also see ebisawa et al .",
    "1996 and balucinska & hasinger 1991 ) and likely extends those findings down an order of magnitude in fractional eddington luminosity , to @xmath49 ) . whereas gx  339@xmath04 was observed in a low  hard state during the rising phase of its 2004 outburst , we observed swift  j1753.5@xmath00127 during the decay phase of its 20052006 outburst .",
    "it follows , then , that disks can remain close to the isco in the low ",
    "hard state both in rising and decay phases of an outburst .",
    "advection  dominated accretion flow models ( adafs ; e.g. esin , mcclintock , & narayan ) predict that the inner disk should be radially truncated in the low  hard state .",
    "indeed , in some black holes observed at similar fractions of the eddington limit ( e.g. , xte j1118@xmath39480 , mcclintock et al .",
    "2001 ) , and at lower luminosities , it is possible that the disk may be radially recessed .",
    "however , our results suggest that this prediction may not hold universally in the low  hard state .",
    "a phenomenological model for jet production ( fender , belloni , & gallo 2004 ) suggests that a truncated disk may facilitate jet production , in part because jet production does appear to be largely quenched in `` high  soft '' states of stellar  mass black holes ( fender 2005 ) wherein the inner disk is commonly thought to extend close to the black hole .",
    "our observation of swift j1753.5@xmath00127 suggests that the jet production may not be enabled by a radially truncated disk , nor quenched by a filled innermost accretion disk .",
    "other factors , perhaps including the mass accretion rate , or the absence of a strong corona in high  soft states , may inhibit jet production .",
    "as previously noted , the spectral results obtained from this analysis are not necessarily at odds with inferences drawn from x - ray timing analyses of black holes in the low  hard state ( miller et al .",
    "low - frequency qpos and noise components are not likely to be directly related to keplerian orbital frequencies at the isco . in transitions from the low ",
    "hard states to higher flux states , the frequency of low - frequency qpos are sometimes observed to saturate .",
    "however , this is again not necessarily indicative of the innermost stable circular orbit , as such qpos have been observed simultaneously with high - frequency qpos which are plausibly related to keplerian orbits in the inner disk ( remillard et a.  2002 ) .    on theoretical grounds , it is all but impossible that a standard optically - thick accretion disk can remain near the black hole in the least luminous phases of the low",
    " hard state as the source approaches quiescence .",
    "however , the fraction of the eddington luminosity at which the disk is actually truncated is yet to be determined .",
    "exploring the regime near @xmath50 will require an order of magnitude longer observation than this 43  ksec exposure .",
    "similarly , to obtain confirmation of the disk radius at @xmath51 via the width of an fe  k emission line , would likely also require a 400500  ksec observation .",
