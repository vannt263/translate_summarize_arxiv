    "the photon colliders offer unique possibility to probe qcd in a new and hitherto unexplored regime .",
    "very high luminosity and relatively sharp spectrum of the backscattered laser photons are the enormous advantages of the photon colliders making it possible to measure very precisely various quantities as well as to have an access to rare qcd processes .",
    "the aim of this introductory talk is to elaborate the following two broad subjects for which the possible measurements at photon colliders may be particularily relevant :    1 .   the photon structure .",
    "2 .   high energy qcd .",
    "the content of our talk is as follows : in the next section we discuss the deep inelastic @xmath4 scattering as the tool for probing the quark content of the photon while in section 3 we consider the measurements which may probe the gluon distributions in the photon . in section 4",
    "we very briefly summarise the theoretical expectations concerning the high energy behaviour of qcd ( i.e. the qcd pomeron and odderon ) and discuss the possibilities of the photon colliders to probe these expectations .",
    "we shall in particular consider production of vector mesons in @xmath5 and @xmath6 collisions and forward jet measurement in @xmath6 collisions . as a probe of the qcd pomeron . in section 5",
    "we discuss the spin dependent structure function @xmath1 of the photon .",
    "finally in section 6 we present a brief summary of our talk .",
    "the deep inelastic @xmath7 scattering , i.e. the process : @xmath8 is characterised by the following kinematical variables :    @xmath9    @xmath10    possibility of precise measurement of the kinematical variables @xmath11 in @xmath4 dis is an enormous advantage of photon colliders .",
    "it is linked with the form of the spectrum of the backscattered laser photons which is more advantageus than the weizsker - williams spectrum of the ( quasi ) real photons exchanged in single tagged @xmath12 collisions .",
    "this in particular allows precise measurement of the photon structure function(s ) with much better accuracy than in the single tagged @xmath12 collisions .",
    "+ the deep inelastic @xmath4 scattering is related in the following way to the photon structure functions @xmath0 and @xmath13 :    @xmath14    @xmath15 \\label{discx}\\ ] ]    where @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the energy and the scattering angle of the tagged electron .",
    "+ in the leading logarithmic approximation ( lla ) of perturbative qcd the structure function @xmath0 is derictly related to the quark distributions in the photon :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 are the quark charges .",
    "evolution of parton densities is governed by the altarelli - parisi equations which in the leading order take the following form @xcite :    @xmath20    @xmath21    where    @xmath22    and    @xmath23    the evolution equations ( [ ap ] ) involve , besides the quark distributions also the gluon distribution @xmath24 in the photon .",
    "+ the novel feature of the evolution equations for the parton distributions in the photons is the presence of the inhomogeneous term proportional to @xmath25 which corresponds to the point - like coupling of the photon to quarks ( antiquarks ) .",
    "the solution of equations ( [ ap ] ) for the parton distributions @xmath26 in the photon ( @xmath27 ) can be written in the following form :    @xmath28    in this equation the distributions @xmath29 are exactly calculable ( modulo dependence upon the scale @xmath30 where @xmath31 ) .",
    "the hadronic component @xmath32 , which corresponds to the general solution of the homogeneous evolution equatioms depends upon the non - calculable starting distributions at the input scale @xmath30 .",
    "existing qcd analyses use nlo approximation in @xmath33 or @xmath34 scheme(s ) @xcite .",
    "1 we show acceptance regions and event rates which are expected to be reached at @xmath3 dis for the backscattered - laser @xmath4 mode of a 500 gev linear collider @xcite . it can be seen from this figure that the @xmath4 collider can offer opportunity to probe the very low values of @xmath35 ( @xmath36 for reasonably large values of @xmath37 ) . at nlo",
    "low @xmath35 behaviour of parton distributions in the photon is dominated by a hadronic component . on the other hand at large values of @xmath35",
    "the quark distributions are dominated by the point - like term .",
    "+ at low @xmath35 one has also to include the low @xmath35 resummation effects in the spltting and coefficient functions which are generated by the small @xmath35 ( i.e. bfkl ) dynamics ( see sec . 5 ) @xcite .",
    "these small @xmath35 effects can significantly enhance the magnitude of the parton distributions in the photon and the photon structure function(s ) at low values of @xmath35 .",
    "the hadronic component remains to be the dominant contribution in this region yet the magnitude of the point like contribution is also enhanced .",
    "+ at very large values of @xmath38 the deep inelastic @xmath4 scattering can also acquire significant contribution from the @xmath39 exchange .",
    "it modifies formula ( [ discx ] ) which corresponds to the ( virtual ) photon exchange .",
    "moreover at very large values of @xmath38 one can have access to the charge current effects in the deep inelastic process @xmath40 which is mediated by the @xmath41 exchange .",
    "the study of this process can in particular give information about the flavour decomposition of the quark distributions in the photon @xcite .",
    "the gluon distribution in the photon is a poorly known quantity . in principle",
    "it can be determined from the analysis of the scaling violation of @xmath0 generated by the evolution equations ( [ ap ] ) , but this constraint turns out to be rather weak . in order to obtain the gluon distribution it is therefore much better to study the measurements which are predominantly sensitive to the gluon content of the photon . thus at low @xmath35 the measurement of the longitudinal structure function @xmath13 might provide a ueful constraint on the gluon distributions in the photon .",
    "the complementary and presumably much more feasible are the dedicated measurements of the hadronic final states in @xmath2 collisions .",
    "the following two processes are of particular interest :    1 .",
    "dijet production , which contains the process + @xmath42 2 .",
    "charm production , which is sensitive to the mechanism + @xmath43    since both these processes are , at least in certain kinematical regions dominated by the photon - gluon fusion mechanism as indicated above , they are sensitive to the gluon distribution in the photon . the detailed discussion of these processes is presented in this workshop in the talks by thorsten wengler and albert de roeck @xcite .",
    "important class of hard processes are the so called semi - hard processes in which the ( large ) scale @xmath38 characterising the `` hardness '' is much smaller than the very large energy squared @xmath44 , i.e. @xmath45 .",
    "these processes are sensitive to the resummation of the powers of the new class of large logarithm @xmath46 in perturbative qcd calculations , i.e. they do probe the high energy limit of perturbative qcd .",
    "+ the high energy limit of perturbative qcd is at present fairly well understood .",
    "the dominant contribution is given by the qcd pomeron singularity which is generated by the ladder diagrams with the ( reggeised ) gluon exchange along the ladder @xcite .",
    "two gluon exchange gives the energy independent cross - sections while exchange of the gluon ladder with interacting gluons generates increase of cross - sections with energy .",
    "+ the sum of ladder diagrams generates the balitzkij , fadin , kuraev , lipatov ( bfkl ) equation : @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes the unintegrated gluon distribution with @xmath35 and @xmath49 denoting the longitudinal momentum fraction of the parent photon carried by the gluon and @xmath49 is the transverse momentum squared of the gluon .",
    "@xmath50 is the suitably defined inhomogeneous term .",
    "+ in leading order ( i.e. in the leading @xmath51 approximation ) we have :    @xmath52\\ ] ]    the following properties of the bfkl dynamics embodied in the bfkl equation should be emphasised .",
    "1.diffusion of transverse momentum along the chain which should reflect itself in the hadronic final state +    \\2 .",
    "characteristic rise with decreasing @xmath35 . in lo @xmath53 +    \\3 .",
    "large subleading effects @xcite .",
    "their major part is however understood and is under control @xcite . +    besides the pomeron qcd does also predict existence of the so called qcd odderon @xcite .",
    "the qcd odderon corresponds to the ( interacting ) three gluons exchange with the three gluons coupled to the odd c , i.e. to non - vacuum quantum numbers .",
    "the intercept of the odderon is close to @xmath54 .",
    "the cross - sections generated by the odderon exchange should then be approximately independent of the incident energy .",
    "+ the high energy photon colliders offer interesting opportunities to probe the qcd pomeron .",
    "it may also appear possible that the photon colliders , thanks to their very high luminosity will allow to measure rare processes generated by the odderon exchange .",
    "+ the following processes are very useful tools for probing the qcd pomeron in high energy @xmath3 and @xmath55 collisions",

    "2 we show theoretical expectations for the cross - section of the diffractive @xmath64 production in @xmath5 collisions , i.e. of the process @xmath65 @xcite . expected magnitude of this cross - section suggests that the measurement of the reaction @xmath65 at the photon colliders should certainly be feasible .",

    "thanks to the possibiliity of having polarised beams the photon colliders offer an opportunity to measure the spin dependent structure function @xmath1 of the photon @xcite .",
    "this is completely unknown quantity and its measurement in polarised @xmath4 dis would be extremely useful for testing qcd predictions in the broad region of @xmath35 and @xmath38 .",
    "+ the spin dependent parton distributions in the photon @xmath70 satisfy in lo altarelli - parisi equations similar to equations ( [ ap ] ) with the term @xmath25 and the splitting functions @xmath71 being replaced by their spin dependent counterparts @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the nlo formalism is also available . in fig .",
    "3 we show theoretical expectations for @xmath74 , @xmath75 and for @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we show results for the two model assumptions concerning the input hadronic component @xmath76 at the reference scale @xmath30 :    @xmath77    where @xmath78 denotes hadronic component of spin independent parton distributions , and for @xmath79 it should be observed that the high energy photon colliders would make it possible to probe the spin dependent structure function of the photon @xmath1 for the very small values of @xmath35 where it is sensitive to the novel effects of the double @xmath80 resummation @xcite .",
    "study of some dedicated measurements , like dijet or charm production in polarised @xmath5 scattering might also give access to the spin dependent gluon distribution @xmath75 in the photon .",
    "in this talk we have confined ourselves to a brief survey of the possible measurements at photon colliders which could probe photon structure and high energy limit of perturbative qcd .",
    "we have in particular emphasised the following points :    1 .",
    "photon colliders permit precise determination of kinematical variables in @xmath61 or @xmath81 scattering that will allow precise measurement of quantities relevant for understanding the structure of the photon ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "2 .   photon colliders will give access to the ( very ) small @xmath35 region in @xmath4 dis .",
    "3 .   photon colliders will be a unique probe of the high energy limit of qcd testing effects of the qcd pomeron and possibly also the odderon exchanges .",
    "the diffractive production of @xmath83 mesons in @xmath5 collisions is one of the very promising processes for probing the qcd pomeron at photon colliders .",
    "4 .   photon colliders offer a unique possibility to measure the spin dependent structure function @xmath1 of the photon .",
