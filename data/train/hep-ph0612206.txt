    "it is well known that the three gauge couplings in the standard model ( sm ) do not unify for the canonical normalization of @xmath0 ( gauge coupling unification in the sm can be realized via non - canonical @xmath0 normalization  @xcite ) . with supersymmetry ( susy ) , which provides an elegant solution to the gauge hierarchy problem",
    ", gauge coupling unification can be approximately achieved in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with unification scale and @xmath5 couplings unify at around @xmath6 gev , while the @xmath5 and @xmath7 unification occurs around @xmath8 gev . ]",
    "@xmath9 around @xmath10 gev  @xcite .",
    "this unification is based on two implicit assumptions : ( 1 ) the @xmath0 normalization is canonical ; ( 2 ) there are no intermediate threshold corrections .",
    "however , the string scale @xmath11 in weakly coupled heterotic string theory is  @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the string coupling constant .",
    "since @xmath14 , we have @xmath15 thus , there exists a factor of approximately 20 to 25 between the mssm unification scale and the string scale . in the strongly coupled heterotic string theory or m - theory on @xmath16  @xcite",
    ", the eleven dimensional planck scale can be the mssm unification scale  @xcite . however , our focus in this paper is on the weakly coupled heterotic string theory .",
    "the discrepancy between @xmath9 and @xmath11 implies that the weakly coupled heterotic string theory naively predicts the wrong values for the electroweak mixing angle ( @xmath17 ) and strong coupling ( @xmath18 ) at the weak scale . because the weakly coupled heterotic string theory is one of the leading candidates for a unified theory of the fundamental particles and interactions in nature , how to achieve string scale gauge coupling unification is an important question in string phenomenology  @xcite .",
    "in addition , there exist intermediate scales in many supersymmetric theories , for example , the invisible axion models with an intermediate peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetry breaking scale around @xmath19 gev  @xcite , the see - saw neutrino models with intermediate right - handed neutrino mass scale around @xmath20 gev  @xcite , string models with gaugino condensation scale around @xmath21 gev  @xcite , or string constructions leading to new vector - like matter not associated with any particular motivation . thus , there could exist intermediate threshold corrections .",
    "in addition , there may exist threshold corrections close to the string scale , for example , around @xmath22 gev .",
    "similarly , heterotic constructions often involve non - canonical @xmath0 embeddings ( and normalizations )  @xcite .    in this paper , assuming a low scale ( tev ) supersymmetry , we systematically study string scale gauge coupling unification by introducing intermediate scale extra particles .",
    "we introduce vector - like particles whose quantum numbers are the same as those of the sm fermions and their hermitian conjugates , and sm adjoint particles .",
    "we do not consider particles which form complete ( or equivalent ) @xmath23 multiplets because they do not change the relative running among the gauge couplings at one - loop .",
    "our approach is different from previous approaches .",
    "we first list all the independent sets yi ( defined in section iii ) of particles that can be employed to achieve @xmath1 and @xmath2 string scale gauge coupling unification .",
    "second , for the case of non - canonical @xmath0 normalization , we achieve string scale @xmath24 unification by choosing suitable @xmath0 normalizations .",
    "alternatively , for canonical @xmath0 normalization , string scale unification can be realized by considering suitable combinations of yi sets .",
    "we also introduce the independent sets zi ( defined in subsection b in section iv ) of particles which do not affect the relative running between the @xmath1 and @xmath2 gauge couplings at one - loop .",
    "then , string scale gauge coupling unification can also be achieved by choosing suitable combinations of one set of particles from yi and one from zi . in quite a few cases",
    "the masses for all the extra particles are roughly the same at the intermediate scale of about @xmath25 gev , or else one set is around @xmath26 gev , which can be considered as string scale threshold corrections . in some cases there",
    "may exist extra particles with masses around hundreds of gev , which can be produced at the lhc or other future colliders .",
    "one can easily use our approach to discuss more general and complicated cases of gauge coupling unification at the string scale .",
    "any set of additional particles that can be employed to achieve the string scale gauge coupling unification can be decomposed as a combination of the yi and zi sets of particles , plus complete @xmath23 multiplets ( these could merely have the quantum numbers of @xmath23 complete multiplets ; the full @xmath23 structure is unnecessary ) . with complete @xmath23 multiplet ( or the equivalent ) , we can shift the mass scales of the extra particles by splitting their masses .",
    "furthermore , we briefly discuss string scale gauge coupling unification in models with higher kac - moody levels for @xmath2 or @xmath1 . a specific model with higher @xmath1 kac - moody level and nocanonical @xmath0 normalization can be found in  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii we present our conventions and input data for the renormalization group equations ( rges ) .",
    "we also list the sm vector - like and adjoint particles and their contributions to the beta functions .",
    "we study the string scale @xmath1 and @xmath2 gauge coupling unification in section iii , and the string scale @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath0 gauge coupling unification in section iv . in section",

    "although these threshold corrections could be important in general , we will not consider them in this paper because we would like to give generic discussions which are model independent .",
    "we define @xmath33 and denote the @xmath34 boson mass as @xmath35 .",
    "the one - loop renormalization group equations are given by @xmath36 with @xmath37 for the sm and @xmath38 for the mssm .",
    "the two - loop rge equations and beta - functions can be found in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "for the numerical calculations , we use the central values of @xmath39  @xcite , and @xmath40  @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we usually assume a supersymmetry breaking scale of @xmath41 gev",
    ". this would be appropriate if all of the sparticles had that value as a common mass .",
    "however , in more realistic scenarios the mass splittings , , between squarks and sleptons lead to an effective scale that is often much lower than the physical masses  @xcite .",
    "hence , we will also consider an effective scale of 50 gev .    to achieve string scale gauge coupling unification",
    ", we only introduce vector - like particles whose quantum numbers are the same as those of the sm fermions and their hermitian conjugates , and sm adjoint particles .",
    "the quantum numbers for additional particle multiplets under the @xmath42 gauge symmetry and their contributions to the one - loop beta functions ( @xmath43 ) are @xmath44    their two - loop beta functions are presented in @xcite .",
    "we include two - loop running for the gauge couplings and one - loop running for the yukawa coupling in the rg evolution .",

    "we do not consider particles with the quantum number of complete @xmath23 multiplets because they do not change the relative running among the gauge couplings at one - loop , although they can be employed to shift the mass scales of the extra particles by splitting the masses of the particles in the @xmath23 multiplets .",
    "in supersymmetric models with low scale supersymmetry breaking , without introducing additional particles , the @xmath1 and @xmath2 gauge couplings unify at about @xmath6 gev . to achieve @xmath4 unification at the string scale ,",
    "we need to introduce sets of particles with @xmath45 .",
    "the independent sets of yi particles , constructed from the extra particles in section ii , that satisfy @xmath46 are @xmath47 where @xmath48 , and @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",

    "assuming that the new particles are degenerate , their command mass can be determined from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq : eq3 ] ) . for simplicity",
    ", we will not study the cases with general combinations of the yi sets here . in the cases",
    "y1 , y2 , y3 , and y4 with @xmath51 , we have @xmath52 . at one - loop level",
    ", the gauge coupling unification only depends on the differences between the one - loop beta functions .",
    "hence , to achieve string scale @xmath4 unification we estimate that the mass scales ( @xmath53 ) at which these extra particles are introduced are all approximately @xmath54 for the other y4 cases , the mass scales of the extra particles depend on @xmath55 and @xmath56 @xmath57 the particles in the set y4 with @xmath58 and @xmath59 can be considered as string scale threshold corrections .",
    "for the two - loop predictions , the actual values of the beta functions matter and these values are shifted , as can be seen in the table  [ tbl : a3 ] .",
    "the mass scales of the extra particles can be shifted by introducing complete @xmath23 multiplets but splitting their masses .",
    "for example , consider the y2 set @xmath60 .",
    "we can give them vector - like mass @xmath61 with @xmath62 , provide that we also introduce vector - like particles @xmath63 with mass @xmath64 .",
    "above @xmath65 , we have complete @xmath66 contributions to the gauge coupling rge running , so that the @xmath67 gauge couplings can still be unified at the string scale .",
    "however , this approach introduces two mass scales for the extra particles , so for simplicity we do not consider it further .      at the string scale , where the @xmath1 and @xmath2 gauge couplings unify",
    ", the @xmath0 gauge coupling in general does not coincide with the other two couplings for a canonical @xmath0 normalization . to achieve string scale @xmath68 unification ,",
    "the simplest possibilities are to consider suitable non - canonical @xmath0 normalizations , add another yi set at a different scale , or introduce additional sets with @xmath69 at an intermediate scale .",
    "the @xmath0 normalization need not be canonical in string model building @xcite , orbifold grand unified theories ( guts ) @xcite and their deconstruction @xcite , and in 4d guts with product gauge groups . similar to heterotic string models , we assume that @xmath70 is a rational number .    once the @xmath71 gauge coupling unification at the string scale is realized , we can unify the @xmath0 gauge coupling by choosing a suitable @xmath0 normalization .",
    "the non - canonical @xmath0 normalizations required for the yi sets of the particles are given in table  [ tbl : a3 ] .",
    "the corresponding string scales @xmath72 can be obtained from eq .",
    "the two - loop prediction of the scale at which the yi particles are introduced is shown as @xmath53 , together with gauge coupling @xmath13 at the string scale @xmath11 .",
    "we also show the percentage deviation of @xmath73 from @xmath74 , @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the unified gauge coupling for @xmath4 at the string scale .",
    "the choice of @xmath70 is not unique .",
