    "one of the application of field theory at finite temperature [ 1 - 4 ] is to find the behaviour of coupling constant as a function of energy , temperature , and the chemical potential using the renormalization group ( rg ) equation .",
    "the knowledge of coupling constant at finite temperature environment then can be used , for instance , in perturbative calculations for quark - gluon plasma created in ion - ion collisions at high energies , in the evaluation of the grand unification scale in a cosmological context and the shift of the energy levels in a hydrogen plasma .",

    "the background field method provides notorious simplifications since we have to calculate only the renormalization constant of the background field gluon propagator .",
    "we discuss this method in section 2.1 .",
    "since the coupling constant depends not only on energy but also on temperature , we derive a pair of rg equations - one for energy and one for temperature .",

    "we discuss the feynman rules at finite temperature in the imaginary time formalism .    in order to get the renormalization constant of the background field gluon propagator we have to calculate the polarization tensor . at finite temperature due to the lack of the lorentz invariance",
    "the structure of the polarization tensor is not equivalent to the zero temperature one . in section 3.1",
    "we give a prescription how to define the renormalization constant at finite temperature . in section 3.2",
    "we calculate the polarization tensor in the one - loop approximation . in section 3.3 calculating the vacuum part of the polarization tensor we reproduce the well known zero temperature formula , i.e. the standard vacuum qcd one - loop result [ 22,23 ] , which reads as    @xmath2^{-1}=[g_{0}^{2}(\\mu_{0})]^{-1}[1 + 2g_{0}^{2}(\\mu_{0})k_{0}/ ( 4\\pi)^{2}]\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath3 here @xmath4 is for @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the number of flavours , @xmath7 is the energy scale and @xmath8 is the reference scale .",

    "( 5.10)-(5.12 ) the authors of ref.[9 ] have extracted the gluon and the vertex renormalization constants in front of lorentz invariant structures not paying attention to the break down of lorentz invariance .",
    "another possible source for discrepancies is that the ward identities are used at finite temperature for different renormalization constants .",
    "remember that the derivation of the ward identity is based on the gauge invariance and also on the lorentz invariance at @xmath89 .",
    "thus it is not a surprise that results from different gauges or even ( within the same gauge ) from different vertices are totally different .",
    "the correspondence between the imaginary and real time formalisms has been investigated in detail [ 14 - 16 ] .",
    "the choice of the formalism can also be the source of the discrepancies under study was pointed out in these references .    to clarify the issue of choosing a suitable renormalization prescription",
    ", one would need to compute the two - loop contributions to the coupling constant at finite temperature .",
    "it was shown , in particular , in the massive @xmath221 scalar model that the one - loop result is drastically changed by two - loop contributions at high @xmath1 and in zero momentum limit [ 29 ] .",
    "\\2 ) as we have seen the function @xmath222 shows a power - like @xmath1-dependence instead of a logarithmic fall - off as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "thus we have @xmath223\\nonumber \\\\ & & = \\sum_{n=1,2 } c_{n}[(t/\\mu)^{n}-(t_{0}/\\mu_{0})^{n}]+\\dots.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] however , if a relation @xmath224 holds , where @xmath225 [ 6 ] , then one would have a logarithmic @xmath1-dependence like in a zero temperature environment .",
    "such a relation holds if one is dealing with the thermal equilibrium . in a thermostat one can not speak about individuals and",
    "thus @xmath7 is not a measurable quantity .",
    "we have derived eq.(2.27 ) using two essentially different rg equations ( 2.23 ) and ( 2.24 ) .",
    "suppose we had used only one rg equation for @xmath1 , i.e. , eq .",
    "( 2.24 ) , then we would have instead of eq .",
    "( 5.33 ) @xmath226\\nonumber \\\\ & & = \\sum_{n=1,2 } c_{n}[(t/\\mu)^{n}-(t/\\mu_{0})^{n}]+\\dots.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this case we would have a power - like dependence even with the relation @xmath224 .",
    "\\3 ) since in a thermostat @xmath1 is a measurable quantity , though @xmath7 is not as , stated in 2 ) , we should be able to define the coupling constant as a function of only @xmath1 .",
    "this could be done by calculating an expectation value of the coupling constant . in that case as a probability density function we could use either the bose or the fermi distribution .",
    "however such an expectation value of the coupling constant could not be used to a scattering process in a thermostat wherein a particle with some definite energy enters .",
    "we would like also to mention that all the machinary for the evolution of the running coupling constant at finite temperature can be analogously applied for the case of a quantum field theory(such as qcd ) at finite energy as formulated in [ 30 ] .    in conclusion , we note in accordance with the previous observations that there is in fact no unique way to define a temperature depending qcd coupling constant and the issue of finding its reasonable prescription is left as a subject of further investigation .",
