    "is open to the values of shear and bulk viscosity , the equation of state , equilibration time , and other properties of the matter .",
    "distributions of hadrons are formed at the very last moment of fireball history when all hadrons leave from the hot and strongly coupled system .",
    "it is therefore instructive to understand how the observed anisotropies of the momentum distribution are connected to the shape and the expansion pattern of the fireball at freeze - out .",
    "helpful tools for this task are the hydrodynamically inspired models of hadron production which allow for easy simulation of different final states of the fireball . here",
    "we will use a model that is in close connection to exact solutions of hydrodynamics as well  the buda - lund model  @xcite .",
    "there are two kinds of source anisotropies which are translated into the anisotropy of hadron distributions .",
    "one is connected with the shape of the fireball and the other with the angular dependence of its expansion velocity .",
    "it has been investigated in the past how they both individually contribute to the second - order anisotropy of single - particle distributions and oscillations of correlation radii in femtoscopy  @xcite .",
    "unprecedented statistics collected in nuclear collisions at the lhc and at rhic allow also detailed study of higher - order anisotropies and higher - order oscillations of bose - einstein correlation radii  @xcite .",
    "there is at present no sufficient theoretical understanding of the femtoscopic measurements .    to this end , we extend here the buda - lund model so that it includes the third - order anisotropy in shape and expansion velocity .",
    "then we give an outlook at the extension to even higher orders .",
    "we further calculate the third - order angular dependence of the spectra and correlation radii and analyze how it is influenced by the different features of the model .",
    "the model provides description of direct hadron production without the inclusion of resonance decays .",
    "although resonances are not included in our current investigation , we note that the core - halo model was developed to correct the hydrodynamical and phenomenological calculations , similar to the ones presented here , to take into account the effects of decays from long - lived resonances  @xcite . long lived resonances decay in a halo region , characterized by large length - scales ( typically 20 fm or larger ) that are outside the hydrodynamically evolving , hot and dense hadronic matter , that is referred to as the core region . comparing the core - halo model calculations to experimental data ,",
    "the main effects of resonances appear to be the modification of the single - particle spectra of pions , and the suppression of the strength of the two - pion bose - einstein correlations , however , their effects on the short range bose - einstein correlation or hbt radii and on the anisotropies of the single particle spectra are negligible , as indicated by the hydrodynamical scaling of these observables  @xcite .",
    "the buda - lund model is formulated in terms of the source function , which represents the ( wigner ) probability density of particle creation at a space - time point @xmath0 and four - momentum @xmath1 .",
    "it generally takes the form of a jttner - type statistical distribution : @xmath2 where @xmath3 stands for degeneracy factor , @xmath4 is the cooper - frye factor  @xcite , @xmath5 is a quantum - statistical term , being @xmath6 for bose - einstein , 1 for fermi - dirac statistics , and 0 for maxwell - boltzmann statistics , and the thermodynamic distribution @xmath7 takes the form @xmath8\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the freeze - out in this model happens along the hypersurface perpendicular to the flow velocity and the cooper - frye factor is expressed as @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the freeze - out probability density in proper time , with @xmath11 being the proper time in the local frame co - moving with the velocity @xmath12 .",
    "the smearing factor of the freeze - out time will be assumed to take the form of a delta function : @xmath13 .",
    "this simplification corresponds to the approximation when the freeze - out happens suddenly at @xmath14 freeze - out time .",
    "the velocity field is calculated from a potential @xmath15 : @xmath16 where @xmath17 . with the potential field",
    "we shall be able to introduce azimuthal angle variations of the expansion velocity field .",
    "the model includes gradients in temperature profile : @xmath18 where @xmath19 parametrizes the gradient and @xmath20 is a scaling variable which depends on spatial coordinates and will be specified later .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 can also be expressed as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the central temperature and @xmath24 is the temperature at the surface of the fireball .",
    "the scaling variable @xmath20 is important when the parametrization is identified as a solution of a certain class of hydrodynamic models  @xcite .",
    "in such a case , its co - moving derivative must vanish @xmath25    the fugacity term is defined similarly @xmath26 i.e.  the parameter @xmath27 is the density gradient .",

    "next we extend the previous formulation of the buda - lund model so that anisotropy in azimuthal angle up to third order is included .",
    "there are two kinds of asymmetries which we investigate in this paper : the spatial asymmetry and the velocity field asymmetry .",
    "the former can be described by the scale variable @xmath20 . for completeness and for the sake of example",
    "let us review that the perfectly symmetric case ( not investigated here ) would be that of spherical symmetry with @xmath29 and the spheroidal symmetry with distinguished longitudinal direction @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",

    "anisotropy parameters are not listed here because they are varied in the different studies reported here .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     generally , one expects that the azimuthal anisotropy has no influence on the azimuthally integrated spectrum .",
    "however , the space and flow anisotropies in the present model modify the effective volume , particularly at high @xmath84 where the anisotropy is more pronounced .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : n1 ] .",
    "thus there is a slight flattening of the single - particle @xmath84 spectra connected with the increase of the anisotropy parameters @xmath85 and/or @xmath86 .",
    "note that in the figure we only show the dependence on @xmath87 but this is qualitatively similar to the dependences on other parameters .",
    "it has been calculated in  @xcite how the elliptic flow coefficient @xmath82 depends on the second order anisotropy in shape and expansion . here , in fig .",
    "[ fig : flows ]    we again plot this dependence together with the dependence of @xmath83 on @xmath88 and @xmath89 . similarly to the second order , also here we have an ambiguity : same values of @xmath90 can be obtained from various combinations of @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "note that @xmath87 and @xmath91 do not influence @xmath83 , and vice versa .",
    "the correlation radii are very important quantities for the exploration of the space - time structure of the source .",
    "generally , the two particle momentum correlation function is defined as @xmath92 the denominator which provides the two - particle distribution with no correlations is experimentally obtained by means of event mixing . usually one introduces the momentum difference @xmath93 and the average pair momentum @xmath94 @xmath95 then the correlation function can be determined ( within reasonable approximation ) from the source function @xmath96    if the shape of the correlation function is reasonably close to a gaussian , then the correlation function can be parametrized by a gaussian @xmath97 run over the spatial directions , and where the parameter @xmath98 stands for the ( in general , mean momentum dependent ) intercept parameter , that measures the strength of two - particle bose - einstein correlation functions .",
    "when particle identification errors are negligibly small , this parameter @xmath98 can be interpreted in the core - halo picture as the ( momentum dependent ) squared fraction of particles coming from the hydrodynamically evolving core  @xcite .    the temporal component of @xmath93 is suppressed via the on - shell constraint @xmath99 for nearly gaussian , for example hydrodynamically evolving sources , the correlation radii @xmath100 can be expressed through spatio - temporal ( co)variances of the hydrodynamically evolving , core part of the source function .",
    "the temporal admixture in these radii is due to the on - shell constraint ( [ e : onshell ] ) .",
    "note , however , that long lived resonances typically dominate the variances of the source distribution even if their decay products are present in a small relative fraction . due to this reason",
    ", the evaluation of the correlation radii has to be restricted to the core or the hydrodynamically evolving part of the source  @xcite .    when studying the azimuthal dependence of the correlation radii , meticulous bookkeeping of the angular variables is requested . recall that we denote that    mi    is the azimuthal angle of the emitted particles    is the @xmath44-th order event plane determined for the distribution of produced hadrons according to eq .",

    "these are sizes of the homogeneity regions from which particles with given momentum are produced . for hydrodynamically expanding fireballs ,",
    "these homogeneity regions are typically smaller than the whole volume of the fireball , if the fireball has gradients in the flow velocity distribution , that lead to variations in the local flow velocities that are larger than what can be overcompensated by the locally thermalized velocity distribution of the emitted particles .",
    "the spatio - temporal distribution of the particle emitting source is frequenty analyzed in the bertsch - pratt side - out - longitudinal decomposition , as measured in the longitudinal center of mass system of the particle pair ( lcms ) .",
    "lcms is the frame where the longitudinal component of a given particle pair has vanishing mean momentum along the beam direction , the transverse momentum components being the same as in the laboratory . in this frame ,",

    "the sidewards or _ side _",
    "direction is perpendicular to both the _ out _ and the _ long _ direction , so that the ( _ side_,_out_,_long _ ) directions form a right - handed coordinate system",

    "<S> the fireball shape however fluctuates on an event - by - event basis . </S>",
    "<S> the transverse plane asymmetry can be translated into a series of multipole anisotropy coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> these anisotropies then result in measurable momentum - space anisotropies , to be measured with respect to their respective symmetry planes . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we detail an extension of the buda - lund model to multipole anisotropies and investigate the resulting flow coefficients and oscillations of hbt radii . </S>"
