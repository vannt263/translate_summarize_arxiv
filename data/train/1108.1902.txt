    "the arithmetic of quadratic forms has long held a special place in number theory . in this paper",
    "we focus our efforts on algebraic varieties @xmath0 which arise as the common zero locus of two quadratic forms @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "we will always assume that @xmath3 is a geometrically integral complete intersection which is not a cone .",
    "under suitable further hypotheses on @xmath6 and @xmath7 , we will be concerned with estimating the number of @xmath8-rational points on @xmath3 of bounded height . where successful this will be seen to yield a proof of the hasse principle for the varieties under consideration .    the work of colliot - thlne , sansuc and swinnerton - dyer @xcite provides a comprehensive description of the qualitative arithmetic associated to the set @xmath2 of @xmath8-rational points on @xmath3 for large enough values of @xmath9 .",
    "in fact it is known that the hasse principle holds for any smooth model of @xmath3 if @xmath1 .",
    "this can be reduced to @xmath10 provided that @xmath3 contains a pair of conjugate singular points and does not belong to a certain explicit class of varieties for which the hasse principle is known to fail .    in this paper the quadratic forms @xmath6 and @xmath7 will have special structures .",
    "let @xmath11 and @xmath12 be integral quadratic forms in @xmath13 variables @xmath14 , with underlying symmetric matrices @xmath15 and @xmath16 , so that @xmath17 for @xmath18 .",
    "then we set @xmath19 we will henceforth assume that @xmath20 is non - singular and that as a variety @xmath21 in @xmath22 , the intersection of quadrics @xmath23 is also non - singular .",
    "it then follows that @xmath3 has a singular locus containing precisely two singular points which are conjugate over @xmath4 .",
    "the question of whether the hasse principle holds for such varieties is therefore answered in the affirmative by @xcite when @xmath24 .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath2 is non - empty , it is well - known ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 2.3 ) , for example ) that @xmath3 is @xmath8-unirational . in particular",
    "@xmath2 is zariski dense in @xmath3 as soon as it is non - empty .",
    "let @xmath25 be the function that counts the number of representations of an integer @xmath26 as a sum of two squares and let @xmath27 be an infinitely differentiable bounded function of compact support .",
    "our analysis of the density of @xmath8-rational points on @xmath3 will be activated via the weighted sum @xmath28 for @xmath29 .",
    "the requirement that @xmath30 be odd is not strictly necessary but makes our argument technically simpler .",
    "simple heuristics lead one to expect that @xmath31 has order of magnitude @xmath32 , provided that there are points in @xmath33 and @xmath34 for every prime @xmath35 .",
    "confirmation of this fact is provided by work of birch @xcite when @xmath36 .",
    "alternatively , when @xmath37 and @xmath20 are both diagonal and the form @xmath38 is indefinite and has rank at least @xmath39 for every non - zero pair @xmath40 , then cook @xcite shows that @xmath41 is permissible .",
    "the following result offers an improvement over both of these results .",
    "[ th1 ] let @xmath41 and assume that @xmath21 is non - singular with @xmath20 also non - singular .",
    "assume that @xmath42 and @xmath43 , for some absolute implied constant , for every @xmath44 .",
    "suppose that @xmath33 and @xmath34 are non - empty for each prime @xmath35 .",
    "then there exist constants @xmath45 and @xmath46 such that @xmath47 the implied constant is allowed to depend on @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "in  [ s : conclusion ] an explicit value of @xmath50 will be given and it will be explained that the leading constant is an absolutely convergent product of local densities @xmath51 whose positivity is equivalent to the hypothesis that @xmath33 and @xmath34 are non - empty for each prime @xmath35 . in particular theorem [ th1 ] provides a new proof of the hasse principle for the varieties @xmath3 under consideration .",
    "our proof of theorem [ th1 ] uses the circle method .",
    "an inherent technical difficulty in applying the circle method to systems of more than one equation lies in the lack of a suitable analogue of the farey dissection of the unit interval , as required for the so - called `` kloosterman refinement '' . in the present case this difficulty is circumvented by the specific shape of the quadratic forms @xmath52 .",
    "thus it is possible to trade the equality @xmath53 for a family of congruences using the familiar identity @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the real non - principal character modulo @xmath56 . in this fashion",
    "the sum @xmath31 can be thought of as counting suitably weighted solutions @xmath57 of the quadratic equation @xmath58 , for which @xmath59 , for varying @xmath60 .",
    "we will apply the circle method to detect the single equation @xmath58 , in the form developed by heath - brown @xcite , thereby setting the scene for a double kloosterman refinement by way of poisson summation .",
    "this approach ought to be compared with joint work of the second author with iwaniec @xcite , wherein an upper bound is achieved for the number of integer solutions in a box to the pair of quadratic equations @xmath61 and @xmath62 , when @xmath63 . in this case",
    "a simple upper bound sieve is used to detect the square , which thereby allows the first equation to be exchanged for a suitable family of congruences .",
    "finally we remark that with additional work it would be possible to work with more general quadrics , in which the term @xmath64 is replaced by an arbitrary positive definite binary quadratic form .",
    "the exponential sums that feature in our work take the shape @xmath65 for positive integers @xmath60 and @xmath66 and varying @xmath67 .",
    "the notation @xmath68 means that the sum is taken over elements coprime to the modulus .",
    "we will extend it to summations over vectors in the obvious way .",
    "there is a basic multiplicativity relation at work which renders it profitable to consider the cases @xmath69 and @xmath70 separately . in the former case",
    "we will need to gain sufficient cancellation in the sums that emerge by investigating the analytic properties of the associated dirichlet series @xmath71 for @xmath72 .",
    "this is facilitated by the fact that @xmath73 can be evaluated explicitly using the formulae for quadratic gauss sums .",
    "we will see in  [ sec : qsum ] that @xmath74 is absolutely convergent for @xmath75 . in order to prove theorem [ th1 ]",
    "it is important to establish an analytic continuation of @xmath74 to the left of this line .",
    "this eventually allows us to establish an asymptotic formula for @xmath31 provided that @xmath76 .",
    "the situation for @xmath77 is more delicate and we are no longer able to win sufficient cancellation through an analysis of @xmath74 alone . in fact",
    "it appears desirable to exploit cancellation due to sign changes in the exponential sum @xmath78 .",
    "the latter is associated to a pair of quadratic forms , rather than a single form , and this raises significant technical obstacles .",
    "we intend to return to this topic in a future publication .    with a view to subsequent refinements , much of our argument works under much greater generality than for the quadratic forms considered in theorem [ th1 ] .",
    "in line with this , unless otherwise indicated , any estimate concerning quadratic forms @xmath79 $ ] is valid for arbitrary forms such that @xmath12 is non - singular , @xmath80 and the variety @xmath81 defined by @xmath82 is a geometrically integral complete intersection .",
    "we let @xmath83 in the notation of .",
    "weil estimate yields @xmath84 when @xmath85 is a prime , since the affine cone over @xmath21 has dimension @xmath86 .",
    "we will need upper bounds for @xmath87 of comparable strength for any @xmath60 .",
    "it will be convenient to make the following hypothesis .",
    "let @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "then we have @xmath90 .    here , as throughout our work",
    ", the implied constant is allowed to depend upon the coefficients of the quadratic forms @xmath91 under consideration and the parameter @xmath92",
    ". we will further allow all our implied constants to depend on the weight function @xmath49 in , with any further dependence being explicitly indicated by appropriate subscripts .",
    "we will establish hypothesis-@xmath93 in lemma [ rho(d ) ] when @xmath21 is non - singular , as required for theorem [ th1 ] .    throughout our",
    "work @xmath94 will denote the set of positive integers .",
    "the parameter @xmath92 will always denote a small positive real number , which is allowed to take different values at different parts of the argument .",
    "we shall use @xmath95 to denote the norm @xmath96 of a vector @xmath97 .",
    "next , given integers @xmath9 and @xmath26 , by writing @xmath98 we will mean that any prime divisor of @xmath9 is also a prime divisor of @xmath26 . likewise @xmath99 is taken to mean the largest positive divisor @xmath100 of @xmath9 for which @xmath101 .",
    "it will be convenient to record the bound @xmath102 for any @xmath103 , a fact that we shall make frequent use of in our work .",

    "we present a proof of lemma [ lem : smith ] , for completeness , the upper bound @xmath120 being trivial .",
