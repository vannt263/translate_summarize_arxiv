    "the simplest model of ferromagnetism in metallic systems was proposed by stoner@xcite . the magnetic ordering in this model takes place when the increase in the orbital energy due to the promotion of electrons to higher energy states is smaller than the energy gain due to the exchange interaction .",
    "as soon as this happens , the system becomes unstable with respect to the transition to a state with a non - zero total spin @xmath0 and , hence , broken @xmath1-invariance . in a bulk system only macroscopically large @xmath0 matters . therefore",
    ", the onset of the instability is well determined - both the exchange and the orbital energies are self - averaging quantities",
    ".    this might not be the case for a small ( mesoscopic ) metallic grain since both orbital and exchange energies are sample specific .",
    "therefore , one should expect strong mesoscopic fluctuations of the magnetization of the grain made from a material that is close to the stoner instability .",
    "this paper is an attempt to develop a theoretical description of these mesoscopic fluctuations .",
    "consider a mesoscopic grain with an even number of electrons at zero temperature , t=0 .",
    "restricting ourselves to the hartree - fock approximation , we can speak about orbital states with energies @xmath2 . for a weak exchange interaction all of the orbitals below the fermi level @xmath3 are double - occupied ( 2-orbitals ) , while those with @xmath4 are empty ( 0-orbitals ) .",
    "this state is a singlet , @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath6=0,1 label correspondingly the highest 2-orbital and the lowest 0-orbital in the singlet ground state , see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ]    for the stronger exchange a state with @xmath7 can become a ground state .",
    "indeed , let us compare the lowest energies @xmath8 of the singlet @xmath9 and triplet @xmath10 states ( see fig .",

    "the lowest triplet state has two single occupied orbitals : @xmath11 ( 1-orbitals ) , while @xmath12 and @xmath13 label 0-orbitals and 2-orbitals respectively .",
    "for the ferromagnetic sign of the spin exchange the two electrons on the 1-orbitals have parallel spins .",
    "assuming @xmath14 symmetry in the spin space of the system we can write the exchange energy of two electrons , which occupy the orbital states @xmath6 and @xmath15 , in the usual heisenberg form @xmath16 where @xmath17 are the spin operators . from this point on the superscript",

    "as a result , the relationship ( [ doublediagonal ] ) is exactly what is needed for eq .",
    "( [ hint ] ) to be valid , provided that the sum in the right - hand side involves terms with @xmath158 as well as those with @xmath154 . therefore , the interaction between electrons on the same orbital _ does not violate the invariance under the rotation of the basis _",
    ", which becomes exact in @xmath159 limit .",
    "on the other hand , _ an additional term of the form eq .",
    "( [ wrong ] ) explicitly violates this symmetry_. for this reason we think that taking such a term into account , as it was done in ref .",
    "@xcite is incorrect .",
    "let us briefly discuss the physical meaning of the three terms in the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the last one exists only in the orthogonal case @xmath160 and leads to the superconducting instability provided that @xmath161 , i.e. , there is an attraction in the cooper channel .",
    "superconducting correlations are suppressed by the magnetic field , and thus do not exist at @xmath148 . here",
    "we are not interested in the effects of superconductivity and assume that the grain is a normal metal at @xmath162 .",
    "it means that @xmath163 .",
    "it is well known that the very same renormalization which leads to superconductivity at @xmath163 renormalizes the negative effective coupling constant in the cooper channel to zero ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "this fact enables us to simply neglect this interaction .",
    "the first two terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) represent the dependence of the energy of the grain on the total number of the electrons inside and on the total spin respectively .",
    "they commute with each other and with the single - particle part of the hamiltonian @xmath164 provided the grain is isolated .",
    "therefore , all states of the grain can be classified by @xmath165 and @xmath0 .    as long as we are interested in spin structure of the system with a _ fixed number of electrons _ , we can disregard the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) . as a result",
    "we arrive to a simple hamiltonian @xmath166    note that the only random component of the problem is the single - particle spectrum @xmath70 , while the exchange @xmath54 does not fluctuate !",

    "there are corrections to eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , which sometimes are of importance .",
