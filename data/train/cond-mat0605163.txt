    "the remarkable experimental control over ultracold atomic gases in optical lattices acquired in the last couple of years  @xcite has opened up completely new lines of interest in the field of bose - einstein condensation .",
    "one of these are ultracold atoms in optical lattices with disorder which can be created by several methods .",
    "one of the possibilities is to use a laser speckle field  @xcite .",
    "an alternative way of creating a disorder potential is the introduction of a tiny fraction of a second atomic species which are strongly localized on random sites  @xcite .",
    "tuning to a feshbach resonance , these random scatterers can even make the disorder very strong .",
    "the random potentials for atoms can be also created via the spatial fluctuations of the electric currents generating the magnetic wire traps  @xcite or with the aid of the incommensurate lattices  @xcite .",
    "disordered lattices for ultracold rubidium atoms have been recently created by superimposing a regular periodic optical potential on the speckle field  @xcite and on the incommensurate lattice  @xcite .",
    "these very recent experimental developments prompt the theoretical question what the behavior of ultracold atomic gases in lattice potentials with disorder might be .",
    "typical for the modern area of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in particular and ultracold atomic gases in general is that such basic theoretical questions have been asked before in a different context .",
    "indeed , there is an enormous body of literature on ultracold fermi gases in disordered lattices referring , first of all , to electrons in amorphous solids , either in the normal or in the superconducting state  @xcite .",
    "the possibility to study fermionic atomic gases from this point of view is a very active and interesting field with which we shall not deal here , however .",
    "suffice it to say that completely new questions appear like the bec - bcs crossover  @xcite .",
    "the influence of disorder on this problem is still completely unknown .    here",
    ", we shall focus exclusively on bosons in potentials with disorder .",
    "this is also known as the dirty boson problem. it first came up in the pre - bec area in the context of experimental investigations of superfluidity of @xmath0he in the random pores of vycor .",
    "the surprising finding that , for sufficiently low coverage of the pores , the @xmath0he superfluidity would disappear even in an extrapolation to zero temperature  @xcite prompted many theoretical studies .",
    "these were based on hartree - fock theory  @xcite , generalizations of the bogoliubov and the beliaev theory  @xcite for random potentials  @xcite , field - theoretical considerations  @xcite , mean - field theory  @xcite , renormalization group theory  @xcite and quantum monte carlo simulations  @xcite as well as numerical diagonalizations  @xcite .",
    "the consensus which developed from these studies is that in a disordered lattice at temperature @xmath1 two new phases of bosons may exist besides the superfluid phase which is theoretically defined by the presence of the off - diagonal long - range order : one is the mott - insulator phase , which only exists at commensurate fillings of the lattice , and is distinguished by the absence of the off - diagonal long - range order , a non - zero energy gap and a vanishing compressibility .",
    "the other is the bose - glass phase , which is distinguished again by the absence of the off - diagonal long - range order , a non - vanishing density of states at zero energy , and a non - zero compressibility .",
    "a more recent suggestion towards identifying the bose - glass phase has been made in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "while these operational definitions of a mott - insulator phase and a bose - glass phase at temperature @xmath1 are precise and clear - cut , they run into the obvious difficulty that experiments and quantum monte carlo simulations are never performed at @xmath1 .",
    "it is therefore necessary to examine the extent to which these or similar definitions can be applied at least at small non - zero temperature .",
    "this is the goal of the present paper . in order to achieve our goal",
    "we have to investigate the low - lying states of a suitable model of strongly interacting bosons in a lattice with disorder .",
    "we shall choose for this purpose a bose - hubbard model with on - site disorder of bounded variation .",
    "for our purpose of defining and distinguishing the various phases at non - zero temperature it is sufficient to analyse the basic model within a mean - field theory which allows to detect all the phases and to see what happens if the system parameters are changed , although it does not provide precise conditions for various phase transitions encountered in the system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 the model and the mean - field approach to its analysis",
    "are defined .",
    "then , in section 3 , the phase boundary between the superfluid and the two non - superfluid phases is derived from the condition of vanishing off - diagonal long - range order .",
    "this is first done for the pure case without disorder , reproducing a well - known result , and then generalizing it to the case with disorder . in section 4",
    "follows the definition of the bose - glass and mott - insulator phases at non - zero temperature and the examination of the phase boundary between them .",
    "a common criterion for the distinction of these two phases at @xmath1 is the compressibility .",
    "how well this quantity serves this purpose at finite temperature is therefore examined in section 5 . in section 6",
    "the paper ends with some final conclusions .",
    "we consider a system of spinless bosons in a homogeneous infinitely extended lattice of dimension @xmath2 described by the bose - hubbard hamiltonian ( in units of @xmath3 ) @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the tunneling matrix element , @xmath6 is the on - site interaction constant , and @xmath7 is the chemical potential . in this work",
    "we assume that the random on - site energies @xmath8 at different sites are uncorrelated and equally distributed with the probability density @xmath9 .",
    "we introduce the superfluid order parameter @xmath10 , where @xmath11   /   \\tr   \\left [       \\exp(-\\beta h )   \\right ] $ ] and @xmath12 denote quantum - mechanical and disorder averaging , respectively , and @xmath13 . making use of the decoupling mean - field approximation in the hopping term  @xcite which is valid for sufficiently high - dimensional systems ,",
    "we obtain the following on - site hamiltonian @xmath14 where we have omitted the site index .",
    "the phase diagram of the system can be obtained in the following manner .",
    "first of all one has to calculate the disorder - averaged free energy of the system @xmath15 corresponding to the hamiltonian  ( [ hmf ] ) . then minimizing it with respect to @xmath16 to determine",
    "@xmath17 one can distinguish the superfluid ( @xmath18 ) and non - superfluid ( @xmath19 ) regions of the parameter space . applying a small phase gradient to the atomic matter - field operator and calculating the corresponding correction to the free energy in a manner similar to ref .",
    "@xcite , one can show that the superfluid density following from the hamiltonian  ( [ hmf ] ) equals @xmath20 . in the non - superfluid region",
    ", one has to work out the disorder average of the static superfluid susceptibility @xmath21 or the density of states @xmath22 for the single - particle excitations  @xcite . in the region where @xmath23 in the interval @xmath24 we have , by the definition we apply , the mott - insulator phase with the energy gap @xmath25 . on the other hand ,",
    "again by definition , the bose - glass phase occurs when @xmath26 which corresponds to a divergent superfluid susceptibility  @xcite .",
    "the form of the mean - field hamiltonian ( [ hmf ] ) implies that , in our approximation , the properties of the mott - insulator phase as well as the bose - glass phase , where @xmath16 vanishes , do not depend on the tunneling matrix element @xmath5 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the boundary between these phases occurs only for small values of @xmath5 .",
    "the transition to superfluidity , where @xmath27 starts to appear , does depend on @xmath5 also in our approximation .",
    "in order to calculate the free energy of the system , one has to solve the eigenvalue problem for the hamiltonian ( [ hmf ] ) .",
    "this can be done exactly by means of numerical calculations .",
    "however , the boundary between the superfluid and non - superfluid phases can also be determined with high accuracy treating the first term in the hamiltonian ( [ hmf ] ) as a perturbation .",
    "the free energy can only depend on @xmath28 since a change of the phase in @xmath16 can be undone by the unitary transformation @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "indeed , the calculations show that the result has the following structure : @xmath31 the explicit form of @xmath32 as well as @xmath33 and @xmath34 for @xmath1 was obtained in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the generalization to @xmath35 and the average over disorder needed here is straightforward .",
    "since @xmath36 turns out to be always positive and @xmath37 can be either positive or negative , the superfluid / non - superfluid transition is of second order .",

    "however , from a thermodynamic point of view , it may be more natural to give the phase diagram in the ( @xmath148)-plane . this is done in fig .",
    "[ mtd ] for the two values of @xmath5 marked in fig .",
    "[ phd]b as dotted lines . on the high temperature side , the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ mtd ] is incomplete , because there the transition to the normal gas phase must occur , which we have not considered in the present work . for both the mott - insulator and the bose - glass phase",
    "this transition would be sharp , if the energy gap or the finite density of states would start to appear suddenly at a critical temperature .",
    "alternatively , the transition could also take the form of a smooth crossover .",
    "for the mott - insulator phase the crossover could occur at the temperature @xmath149 , where @xmath25 is the energy - gap for thermal excitations @xcite .",
    "for the bose - glass phase this would happen at the temperature where the density of states starts to be dominated by the normal bose gas .",

    "[ phd]b , with the tunneling amplitude @xmath74  ( a ) , @xmath75  ( b).,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    in our calculations , we find direct transitions from the superfluid phase either to the mott - insulator or to the bose - glas phase under variation of @xmath5 , depending on the values of @xmath7 and the disorder strength @xmath58 ( fig .  [ phd ] ) .",
    "the character of the transition from the superfluid to the bose - glas phase is in agreement with monte carlo calculations .",
    "the direct transition from the superfluid to the mott - insulator phase in the case of weak disorder @xmath51 is also in agreement with the results obtained by the path - integral monte carlo techniques  @xcite and by the monte carlo simulations based on the @xmath5-current model , which neglects amplitude fluctuations of the bosonic quantum fields , for @xmath97  @xcite and for some finite interval of @xmath7 near the tip of the mott - insulator lobe  @xcite .",
    "however , more recent monte carlo investigations of the @xmath5-current model  @xcite , still neglecting the amplitude fluctuations , show that the superfluid and the mott - insulator regions on the phase diagram are separated by a narrow region occupied by the bose - glas phase if the number of lattice sites is large enough .",
    "thus , different monte carlo techniques give different results on the character of the superfluid  mott - insulator transition in the presence of disorder .",
    "other methods lead also to mutually conflicting results concerning this point  @xcite . here",
    "we have presented the results of the mean - field approach .",
    "experimentally , the bose - glass phase may not be easy to identify with ultracold atoms in a suitably disordered lattice .",
    "in fact , it might best be identifiable indirectly by the absence of properties which are present in the competing phases for @xmath151 , like the absence of a macroscopic wave function and the absence of an energy gap or of incompressibility  @xcite .",
    "the finite density of states at @xmath152 would show up in a specific heat proportional to @xmath61 for @xmath153 and in a logarithmically diverging susceptibility @xmath21 .",
    "it would certainly be of great interest if a way could be found to measure @xmath154 directly .",
    "this work was supported by the sfb / tr 12 of the german research foundation ( dfg ) ."
