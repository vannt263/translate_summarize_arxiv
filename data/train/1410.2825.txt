    "current strategies to search for new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) can be broadly divided into two categories . in the first category",
    "we look for new resonant states . in the second category ,",
    "new states are assumed to be heavy , and we look for their indirect effects in the interactions of known particles .    the top quark has been a natural probe to new physics in the first category , due to its large mass and strong coupling to the electroweak symmetry breaking sector .",
    "searches for resonant states through decay processes involving the top quarks have been performed both at the tevatron and at the lhc .",
    "examples include @xmath0 resonance searches , top partner production , and so on .",
    "unfortunately , until now no new states have been discovered , and exclusion limits have been placed , up to around several tev scale .    on the other hand , the top quark physics has entered a precision era , thanks to the large number of top quarks produced at the tevatron and lhc .",
    "various properties of the top quark have been already measured with high precision , and the upcoming lhc run - ii will continue to increase the precision level . from the theory side ,",
    "accurate sm predictions are also available . as a result",
    "the focus of top quark physics is now moving toward the second category , i.e.  to measure accurately the known interactions and the rare processes of sm particles .",
    "examples are measurements on @xmath1-helicity fractions in top - quark decay , and searches for processes involving flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) of the top quark .",
    "these are the main topics of this talk .",
    "when looking for deviations from the sm interactions , the standard approach is to utilize the effective field theory ( eft ) framework , in which deviations from the sm are parameterized by including higher dimensional operators .",
    "the approach is valid when the new physics scale , @xmath2 , is higher than the scale of the process . assuming the full sm gauge symmetries , the leading new operators involving a top quark arise at dimension six . at this level",
    "the lagrangian can be written as @xmath3 a calculation in the eft framework consists of three steps :    1 .   matching calculation .",
    "the eft is matched to the full theory which lives at the high energy scale @xmath2 .",
    "this determines the operator coefficients @xmath4 , defined at the matching scale .",
    "2 .   renormalization group ( rg ) evolution .",
    "the coefficients will be evolved down to a lower scale @xmath5 where the actual process takes place .",
    "this essentially resums the @xmath6 terms .",
    "matrix element calculation , to be performed at scale @xmath5 .",
    "the procedures are familiar from the rg - improved perturbation theory which plays an important role in flavor physics .",
    "indeed there is a similarity between top quark physics and flavor physics . in flavor physics ,",
    "the full theory is the sm , possibly with some new physics .",
    "the matching is performed at scale @xmath7 , where the heavy sm particles are integrated out .",
    "the theory is then evolved down to lower scales where the matrix element can be computed either perturbatively or non - perturbatively . in the top quark physics ,",
    "the full theory is the sm plus new physics , which is to be matched to the eft at scale @xmath8 , where the new physics lives .",
    "the procedure integrates out heavy particles in the new physics , but the heavy particles of the sm remain in the effective theory , leading to 59 dimension - six operators in total for one generation of fermions @xcite .",
    "we then select the ones that are relevant for top - quark processes and evolve them down to a scale of @xmath9 .",
    "cross sections can then be computed in terms of these operator coefficients .",
    "recently the rg equations for all dimension - six operators have been derived at the one - loop level @xcite , completing the second step in this picture .",
    "there are also new developments in matrix element calculations .",
    "in particular , the top - quark decay and several fcnc processes have been computed at nlo in qcd , and the automation of the fcnc processes in the mg5_amc@nlo framework @xcite is now in progress .",
    "these will be discussed in the remainder of this talk .",
    "in this section we will discuss the main decay channel of the top quark , @xmath10 , focusing on the @xmath1-helicity fractions .",
    "for sm couplings and unpolarized top - quark production , the helicity fractions are approximately 70% longitudinal and 30% left - handed .",
    "accurate predictions at nnlo in qcd and nlo in electroweak are available .    in an eft",
    ", dimension - six operators will modify the helicity fractions .",
    "first of all , there are operators that directly modify the standard @xmath11 vertex function .",
    "they are @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the left - handed ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) doublet .",
    "the qcd corrections to these operators have been computed in ref .",
    "deviations from the sm predictions are expected to be dominated by contribution from @xmath16 .",
    "a second possibility comes from the color - dipole operator , @xmath17 which only contributes at nlo in qcd .",
    "this has been computed in ref .",
    "there is a mixing effect from operator @xmath18 to @xmath16 , given by @xmath19 .",
    "finally , four - fermion operators such as @xmath20 should also be considered .",
    "these operators arise from for example a heavy @xmath21 particle exchange , and can directly contribute to the @xmath22 final state .",
    "their contributions to the total decay rate are small .",
    "nevertheless we can hope to set some bounds using differential decay rate , since they will affect not only the measured @xmath23 value ( which would be tiny in the sm ) , but also the @xmath24 spectrum .",
    "the helicity fractions are measured both at the tevatron and at the lhc .",
    "using the results from ref .",
    "@xcite , one can already set some constraints . for illustration , assuming other operators vanish , the limit on @xmath16 is @xmath25 at 95% cl .",
    "however one should keep in mind that considering only one operator at a time is not natural , in particular due to the operator mixing effects . in principle , four - fermion operators should also be considered , however current strategy to top - quark reconstruction requires that @xmath24 is equal to the @xmath1 mass .",
    "this condition does not apply when four - fermion operators are present , so the current limits on the helicity fractions can not be used to constrain four - fermion operators .",
    "flavor - changing decay modes such as @xmath26 are suppressed by the glashow - iliopoulos - maiani mechanism , and the sm predictions for the branching ratios are of order @xmath27 .",
    "any evidence for these decay modes would be a definite signal for new physics . in the eft framework the decay rates for @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are all computed at nlo in qcd @xcite .",
    "relevant operators can be found in [ sec : app ] . on the experimental side , branching ratios for @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 final states have been measured both at the tevatron and at the lhc .",
    "single top production processes via fcnc couplings are also studied , via @xmath35 at lep2 , @xmath36 at hera , and @xmath37 at the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "limits on fcnc couplings obtained from production processes are often converted to limits on branching ratios .",
    "in general , a single process can depend on many operators , and so one measurement can only set bounds on a specific linear combination of operator coefficients .",
    "once we combine all available measurements , a global analysis can be performed to determine the allowed region for all operator coefficients .",
    "however , limits obtained by experimental collaborations almost always assume only one fcnc interaction is present at a time .",
    "in addition , four - fermion operators are always neglected in both production and decay processes .",
    "for these two reasons it is difficult to perform a real global fit based on the eft framework .    to illustrate the feasibility of such a global approach , here we present an `` approximate '' global fit for the top quark fcnc sector .",
    "we neglect all four - fermion operators , and only consider @xmath38 @xcite , @xmath39 @xcite , but limit for @xmath30 is expected to be better @xcite .",
    "a slightly weaker bound @xcite applies for both decay modes . ] and @xmath40 @xcite via fcnc couplings involving an up quark .",
    "moreover we interpret the limit from @xmath41 @xcite as a direct bound on the branching ratio of @xmath42 , which is much tighter than the current bound measured at the tevatron .",
    "these four measurements suffice to constrain all two - quark fcnc operators .",
    "unfortunately , the published information is not enough for a consistent combination of all four measurements at 95% cl , therefore we only require that all constraints at 95% cl are independently satisfied .",
    "the result of the fit is shown in figure  [ fig : limits ] .",
    "the blue lines are obtained by setting other coefficients to zero , while the red lines are obtained by allowing other coefficients to float .",
    "for some operators the blue and red lines are different , indicating that a correlation is present between the operators .",
    "this effect between @xmath43 and @xmath44 can be observed in figure  [ fig : ubuw ] .",
    "allowed region in @xmath45 space , from @xmath46 and @xmath41 , by fixing other coefficients to zero and by allowing them to float .",

    "@xmath47 tev . ]",
    "the situation can be more complicated if four - fermion operators are included .",
    "these operators may contribute to the decay channel @xmath48 , which is the actual final state of the @xmath38 measurements .",
    "consider for example the following operator @xmath49 its contribution is comparable with typical contributions from two - fermion operators . therefore constraining four - fermion operator coefficients from @xmath50 is possible .",
    "invariant mass distribution of lepton pairs from fcnc top - quark decay .",
    "contributions from two - fermion operators , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and four - fermion operator @xmath53 are compared .",
    "@xmath2=1 tev . ]",
    "the main difference between two- and four - fermion operators is reflected by the invariant mass distribution of the lepton pairs .",
    "two - fermion operators involve a @xmath54 boson and show a peak near the @xmath54 mass , while four - fermion operators give a more flat spectrum .",
    "we illustrate this difference in figure  [ fig:4fdecay ] , where the four - fermion operator @xmath53 and two additional two - fermion operators @xmath55 and @xmath52 are included .",
    "current strategies to searching for fcnc top - quark decay impose some on - shell cuts on the invariant mass of the two leptons , e.g.  @xmath56 $ ] gev , to select events with two leptons coming from an on - shell @xmath54 boson .",
    "these are displayed in figure  [ fig:4fdecay ] as two dashed straight lines . after applying these cuts ,",
    "the contributions from the three operators are : @xmath57 this implies that even with the on - shell cuts , the four - fermion operator is still not negligible .",
    "in fact , the above results will lead to limit on @xmath58 that is only 3 times larger than those of the two - fermion operator coefficients .",
    "on the other hand , looking at the off - shell regions of the spectrum will give us more information . the decay rate in @xmath59\\cup[102,\\infty]$ ]",
    "gev is : @xmath60 we can see that two - fermion contributions are suppressed while the four - fermion one is enhanced , so by looking at both regions we can constrain two- and four - fermion operators separately .",
    "due to less drell - yan background in the off - shell region , one might even get a better sensitivity on four - fermion operators .",
    "we now turn to single top production via top - quark fcnc .",
    "recently single top production associated with a photon and with a @xmath54-boson have been searched for at the lhc @xcite .",
    "limits are obtained on the fcnc couplings @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "single top production associated with a higgs boson has also been proposed as a probe of the @xmath61 and @xmath64 couplings .",
    "these analyses are important consistency checks for the fcnc searches already performed in top - decay processes . in a global fit based on an eft approach",
