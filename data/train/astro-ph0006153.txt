    "loose groups of galaxies are important but little - understood entities .",
    "they are intermediate in scale between galaxies and rich clusters , and thus their dynamics are important in the study of the distribution of dark matter on scales greater than haloes of galaxies but smaller than the typical sizes of large clusters [ see , for example , the review by oemler ( 1988 ) ] .",
    "their environment is also intermediate between that of isolated galaxies and that of the cores of rich clusters , and therefore the study of groups may provide clues to the processes that create the observed dependency of galaxy morphology on environment ( postman & geller 1984 ; oemler 1992 ; allington - smith et al .",
    "1993 ; whitmore , gilmore , & jones 1993 ; zabludoff et al .",
    "1996 ; hashimoto et al .",
    "1998 ) . only in the past 15 years , however , with the advent of extensive galaxy redshift surveys , have suitably uncontaminated , objective group catalogues been available for study .",
    "galaxies and rich clusters of galaxies are generally easy to identify .",
    "they are high - contrast objects compared with their immediate surroundings .",
    "unfortunately , loose groups of galaxies , which are neither particularly dense nor exceptionally populous , are much more difficult to distinguish from their surroundings .",
    "early group catalogues were based upon the identification of galaxy concentrations on the sky , first primarily by visual inspection of photographic plates ( e.g. , holmberg 1969 , de  vaucouleurs 1975 ) , and , later , via objective group - finding algorithms ( e.g. , turner & gott 1976 ) . since these group catalogues relied especially on just the two dimensions of spatial information available on the plane of the sky , they were greatly subject to contamination from projection effects",
    ". projection effects are largely mitigated ( although never fully eliminated ) in group catalogues derived from galaxy redshift surveys . in the early-1980 s , huchra & geller ( 1982 ; hg82 ) , pioneers in the extraction of groups from redshift surveys by means of objective , `` friends - of - friends '' percolation algorithms , compiled a group catalogue from a shallow ( @xmath10 ) whole - sky redshift catalogue containing 1312 galaxies .",
    "they later derived a group catalogue from the original ( @xmath11 ) cfa survey ( hereafter , cfa1 ) ( geller & huchra 1983 ; gh83 ) .",
    "the cfa1 has in fact proved to be a popular testing ground for group - finding algorithms ; additional group catalogues drawn from the cfa1 include those by nolthenius & white ( 1987 ; nw87 ) , nolthenius ( 1993 ; n93 ) , and moore , frenk , & white ( 1993 ; mfw93 ) .",
    "groups have also been identified in a @xmath12 slice from the cfa extension to @xmath13 [ henceforth , cfa2 ; ramella , geller , & huchra 1989 ( rgh89 ) ] and in the diameter - limited southern sky redshift survey [ ssrs ; maia , da costa , & latham 1989 ( mdcl89 ) ] .",
    "more recently , group catalogues have been extracted from the full northern cfa2 by ramella , pisani , & geller ( 1997 ; rpg97 ) , from the pisces - perseus redshift survey ( pps ) by trasarti - battistoni ( 1998 ; tb98 ) , and from the eso slice project ( esp ) galaxy redshift survey by ramella et al .",
    "( 1999 ; rzz99 ) .    in this paper , we will present a group catalogue based upon the las campanas redshift survey ( lcrs ; shectman et al .  1996 ) . due to the large volume this survey samples ,",
    "the lcrs includes numerous `` great wall''-like structures within its borders and is therefore one of the first redshift surveys which can claim to enclose a reasonably fair sample of the nearby universe . with the exception of the esp ,",
    "the redshift surveys from which the aforementioned group catalogues have been derived have all tended to be dominated by a very few large structures . therefore , a group catalogue based upon the lcrs should be found to contain groups in a wider range of environments than the groups identified from these shallower surveys .",
    "a census of group properties based upon lcrs groups would thus be more complete , and therefore more useful for studies of both galaxy dynamics and environmental dependences .",
    "in fact , this characteristic is so important that earlier variations of the present catalogue have already been used in studies of the environmental influence on galaxy morphology ( hashimoto & oemler 1998 ) , on the presence of `` e+a '' galaxies ( zabludoff et al .",
    "1996 ) , and on the general rate of star formation within galaxies ( hashimoto et al .",
    "1998 , allam et al.1999 ) .",
    "we divide the remainder of this paper as follows : we describe the lcrs galaxy sample in   2 , discuss the modified `` friends - of - friends '' algorithm used to extract the lcrs group catalogue in   3 ,",
    "present the catalogue itself in   4 , and compare it with various group catalogues and with abell clusters [ abell 1958 ; abell , corwin , & olowin 1989 ( aco ) ] in   5 and ",
    "6 ; in   7 , we summarize and conclude .",
    "the lcrs is an optically selected galaxy redshift survey which extends to a redshift of 0.2 and which is composed of a total of 6 alternating @xmath14 slices , 3 each in the north and south galactic caps . completed in 1996 ,",
    "the lcrs contains 26,418 galaxy redshifts , of which 23,697 lie within the official geometric and photometric limits of the survey .",
    "accurate @xmath7-band photometry and sky positions for program objects were extracted from ccd drift scans obtained on the las campanas swope 1-m telescope ; spectroscopy was performed at the las campanas du  pont 2.5-m telescope , originally via a 50-fiber multi - object spectrograph ( mos ) , and later via a 112-fiber mos . for observing efficiency ,",
    "all the fibers were used , but each mos field was observed only once .",
    "hence , the lcrs is a collection of 50-fiber fields ( with nominal apparent magnitude limits of @xmath15 ) and 112-fiber fields ( with nominal apparent magnitude limits of @xmath16 ) ; see figure  1 .",
    "thus , selection criteria vary from field to field , but these selection criteria are carefully documented and therefore easily taken into account . observing each field only once , however , creates an additional selection effect : the protective tubing of the individual fibers prevents the spectroscopic observation of both members of galaxy pairs within 55  arcsec of each other .",
    "hence , groups and clusters can be undersampled , potentially causing physical groups to be split by a `` friends - of - friends '' percolation algorithm and resulting in the mis - estimate of general group properties .",
    "we will return to this problem in the next section .",
    "in constructing the group catalogue , we have considered only those lcrs galaxies within the official geometric and photometric borders of the survey ; we have furthermore limited this sample to galaxies having redshifts in the range @xmath17 and luminosities in the range @xmath18 to avoid group - member incompleteness at the extremal distances of the sample , only groups within @xmath19 were admitted into the final group catalogue .",
    "[ n.b . : unless otherwise noted , all redshifts @xmath20 in this text are corrected for motion relative to the dipole moment of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ; lineweaver et al .  1996 ) .",
    "the lcrs group catalogue was extracted by means of an adaptive `` friends - of - friends '' percolation algorithm based upon that of hg82 and modified for use with comoving distances and field - to - field sampling variations .",
    "we outline the procedure as follows : first , a seed galaxy ( `` galaxy @xmath21 '' ) is selected which has not yet been classified as either a group member or an isolated galaxy .",
    "every other non - classified galaxy @xmath22 in the survey sample is then tested to see if it lies within a projected separation @xmath23 and a velocity difference @xmath24 of the seed galaxy ( note that both @xmath23 and @xmath24 are functions of both the field @xmath25 and of the mean distance to galaxy pair @xmath26 ) : @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 the distances @xmath30 are comoving , @xmath31\\ ] ] ( @xmath32 and @xmath33  km  s@xmath2  mpc@xmath2 ) .",
    "the variable @xmath34 is the angular separation between the two galaxies .",
    "if no companions are found within @xmath23 and @xmath35 of the seed galaxy , it is assigned `` isolated '' status and another seed galaxy is sought .",
    "if companions are found , they are added along with the seed galaxy to a list of group members forming a new group . in turn , the surroundings of each of these companions are combed for the next level of `` friends . ''",
    "this loop is repeated until no further companions are located , and the process is begun again by pursuing another seed galaxy .",
    "the group catalogue is complete only once every galaxy in the redshift sample has been classified as either `` isolated '' or `` grouped . ''",
    "only those groups containing three or more members are included in the final catalogue .",
    "the linking parameters , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , are specified in a manner which compensates for both the radial selection function and the field - to - field sampling variations characteristic of the lcrs . for each pair of galaxies , @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively , for a given fiducial field at given fiducial redshift , and where @xmath39 is a linking scale which takes into account variations in galaxy sampling rate .",
    "it is defined by @xmath40^{-1/3 } , \\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the number density of galaxies one would expect to observe at a comoving distance @xmath26 in field @xmath25 for a randomly homogeneous distribution of galaxies having the same selection function and sampling fraction as the lcrs redshift catalogue ; @xmath42 is @xmath41 for a given fiducial field at a given fiducial redshift ( fig .  2 ) . both @xmath42 and @xmath41",
    "are computed by numerically integrating the field s selection function ( see appendix  a ) .    to elaborate , the fiducial field is an idealized field with a given set of characteristics .",
    "the fiducial field is itself never generated .",
    "it merely serves as the basis for the normalization of the linking scale @xmath39 in equation  9 . for simplicity",
    ", we have chosen our fiducial field to have 100% sampling , flux limits of @xmath43 , and a schechter ( 1976 ) luminosity function with the same parameter values as the lcrs 112-fiber sample : @xmath44 ( lin et al .",
    "since it is roughly the median redshift of the survey , we have chosen the fiducial redshift @xmath45 to be 30,000  km  s@xmath2 .    moving on",
    ", we note that field - to - field sampling variations are of particular concern when linking occurs across a field border .",
    "this concern is especially important in the case of a group situated on the border between a 50-fiber field and a 112-fiber field , where a factor of 2 discontinuity can occur in the expected surface density of galaxies on the sky .",
    "( fortunately , only @xmath46 of the groups in the final catalogue  28 out of 1495  straddle a 50/112 border . ) therefore , when calculating the linking scale @xmath39 for two galaxies in two different fields , @xmath41 is taken to be its average from the two fields , @xmath47    but what of the artificial splitting of groups due to the lcrs s 55  arcsec fiber separation limit ? to avoid this problem ,",
    "each of the @xmath48 galaxies originally excluded from lcrs redshift catalogue due to the fiber separation limit has been re - introduced into the sample by assigning it a redshift equal to that of its nearest neighbor convolved with a gaussian of width @xmath49  km  s@xmath2 ( roughly the median line - of - sight velocity dispersion of a cleaned lcrs group sample which excludes the 55-arcsec `` orphans '' ) .",
    "the re - included galaxies subscribe to all the same photometric limits and spatial borders that are imposed upon the original galaxy sample (   2 ) .    in closing",
    ", we note that , for a given choice of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , this algorithm leads to a unique group catalogue independent of the choice of the original seed galaxy . due to the aforementioned field - to - field variations in sampling , however , it is more intuitive to characterize a group catalogue extracted from the lcrs not with @xmath37 for a certain fiducial field , but with @xmath50 the corresponding number density enhancement of the surface contour which delimits each group ; the value @xmath51 characterizes the groups more generally , as it is valid no matter the field in which a given group resides .",
    "so far , it has been shown how the superstructure of the group - finding algorithm has been set into place .",
    "the choice of values for @xmath52 ( @xmath37 ) and @xmath38 , however , has yet to be presented and explained .",
    "we shall follow a course very similar to that of hg82 in our justification of the two values ultimately adopted .",
    "take figure  3 as a guide to the choice of @xmath51 ( @xmath37 ) and @xmath38 .",
    "their selection should satisfy a few basic criteria .",
    "first , the density enhancement contour sought should be high enough to limit the number of interloper galaxies contained within a group , but not so high that only the cores of rich clusters are found .",
    "on the other hand , for a thin - wedge geometry like that of an lcrs slice , the groups selected should not be too loose ; otherwise , edge effects become excessive . furthermore , the value of @xmath38 , as with the value of @xmath51 ( @xmath37 ) , should minimize the number of interlopers , but without biasing group line - of - sight velocity dispersions toward artificially low values .",
    "as a definite upper limit , @xmath38 should not exceed the radius ( in  km  s@xmath2 ) of a typical void observed at @xmath45 .",
    "the range of acceptable values for @xmath51 ( @xmath37 ) and @xmath38 are enclosed by the solid border in figure  3 . by means of the following semi - quantitative arguments",
    ", it will be concluded that the most reasonable values for the two linking parameters are @xmath53 which are denoted in figure  3 by an asterisk .",
    "first , consider the number of interlopers per galaxy , @xmath54 , within a specified @xmath23 and @xmath24 of some galaxy .",
    "for a given galaxy , @xmath54 can be roughly estimated by the equation ( hg82 ) @xmath55 \\sigma_{\\rm gal } , \\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the surface number density of galaxies in the redshift catalogue , @xmath57 is the total number of galaxies in the sample , and @xmath58 is the number of galaxies within @xmath24 of the galaxy s velocity @xmath59 .",
    "( this measure is actually an underestimate of @xmath54 , since it neglects the correlation of galaxy positions on the sky , but , if we stringently limit the number of interlopers per galaxy , it is adequate for our purposes . )",
    "the lower curve in figure  3 denotes the locus @xmath60 for the the fiducial field at the fiducial redshift @xmath61 30,000  km  s@xmath2 . below and to the right of this curve , where @xmath62 , the number of interlopers per galaxy is considered excessive , and thus this curve constitutes one of our boundaries .",
    "figure  4 presents @xmath54 for the redshift of each galaxy in the lcrs sample for the values of @xmath51 ( @xmath37 ) and @xmath38 listed in equation  13 .",
    "the bumps and dips in figure  4 are due to inhomogeneities within the distribution of galaxy velocities ( the wall - like structures ) in the lcrs ( shectman et al .",
    "note that the median number of interlopers per galaxy @xmath63 for our eventual choice of @xmath51 ( @xmath37 ) and @xmath38 .",
    "there is only a slight large - scale trend evident in figure  4 , the fact of which argues that the number of spurious groups in the final catalogue should not be a strong function of redshift .    to preclude only finding the dense central regions of rich clusters , an arbitrary upper limit to the density enhancement contour cut",
    "is set at @xmath64 , equivalent to assigning a value of 0.528  @xmath65  mpc to @xmath37 . in the quest for a catalogue of loose groups ,",
    "a lower density contrast cutoff is preferred . upon testing , it was discovered that , below a contrast of @xmath66 , edge effects become a problem . at these cutoffs , over half of the groups must be excluded from the clean sample used in the study of group properties ; the group radii encroach upon the slice s borders .",
    "thus , the density contrast @xmath66 was chosen for the group catalogue , since it provides a reasonable compromise between the pursuit of loose groups and the desire for a large clean sample .",
    "next , the value of @xmath38 should be chosen such that group velocity dispersions are not overconstrained . to avoid seriously underestimating group velocity dispersions",
    ", we must set @xmath38 to a value which accommodates the maximum _ likely _ physical velocity dispersion , @xmath67 .",
    "mathematically , the maximum _",
    "possible _ velocity dispersion of a group , @xmath68 , is that obtained when the group is maximally spread out in redshift  i.e. , when each group member is just within the linking velocity @xmath24 of its nearest neighbor : @xmath69^{\\case{1}{2 } } .\\ ] ] for example , the maximum velocity dispersion possible for a group containing @xmath70 galaxies would be @xmath71 at the very least , we want this theoretical maximum _ possible _ velocity dispersion to encompass  i.e. , to be greater than  the maximum _ likely _ physical velocity dispersion . due to the lcrs galaxy selection function ,",
    "a group containing @xmath70 galaxies in a fiducial field at the fiducial velocity ( @xmath7230,000  km  s@xmath2 ) will typically be of abell richness class @xmath73 ( abell 1958 ) . if we make the conservative assumption that the maximum likely @xmath74 for a physical @xmath75 `` group '' is no more than about @xmath76  km  s@xmath2 ( zabludoff et al.1993 ; rpg97 ) , we can set a lower limit for @xmath38 by means of the relation @xmath77 which yields @xmath78 400  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "this value provides the leftmost boundary to the region of acceptable @xmath79 in figure  3 . at the other extreme ,",
    "the velocity linking parameter should not be so large that galaxies are linked across a void diameter .",
    "thus , we give @xmath38 a maximum limit equal to the typical radius of observed voids near @xmath80 30,000  km  s@xmath2 , or @xmath81 2000  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "this maximum @xmath38 provides the rightmost border in figure  3 . to fine - tune @xmath38 ,",
    "the group algorithm was run , using @xmath66 , for four different values : @xmath82 500  km  s@xmath2 , @xmath82 1000  km  s@xmath2 , @xmath82 1500  km  s@xmath2 , and @xmath82 2000  km  s@xmath2 ( fig .",
    "many of the group velocity dispersions are unaffected by the change in @xmath38 , but a significant number of groups , by adding progressively more outlying galaxies , see a dramatic increase in @xmath74 as @xmath38 is increased from 500  km  s@xmath2 to 2000  km  s@xmath2 . in the end , @xmath82 500  km  s@xmath2 was chosen , due to its lower probability of incorporating spurious groups into the catalogue , and due to its ability to generate a catalogue with a relatively low redshift - dependence in @xmath74 .",
    "this latter property especially makes for a more homogeneous group sample .",
    "the full catalogue contains 1495 groups and includes 35% of the lcrs galaxy sample ( figs .",
    "6 , 7 , & 8) .",
    "the complete list of lcrs groups and their individual properties is compiled in table  1 , which , due to its size , is confined to the electronic version of this text .",
    "members of the clean sample of 394 groups  those which have barycenters more than two pairwise separations [ column ( 12 ) ] from a slice edge , crossing times [ column ( 16 ) ] less than a hubble time , corrected line - of - sight velocity dispersions [ column ( 9 ) ] greater than zero , and no 55-arcsec `` orphan '' galaxies as group members  are marked by an asterisk in column ( 1 ) .",
    "group properties are calculated according to the prescriptions of rgh89 , but modified for use with comoving distances and field - to - field sampling variations .    before we enter a description of the tabulated group properties , we must note two caveats .",
    "first , even the clean sample is unlikely to be perfectly clean . as noted , one of the rejection criteria used is the removal of groups which are closer than two pairwise separations from a slice edge . in doing so , we have followed the lead of rgh89 , who used this same rejection criterion to define their clean group sample .",
    "clearly , having no `` edge - proximity '' rejection criterion would include many groups which overflow the survey boundaries .",
    "the measured properties of these groups would be biased from their true values due to their truncated membership . since the pairwise separation , @xmath83 , is a measure of the group radius , excluding groups which are closer than one @xmath83 to a slice edge should go far in counteracting this effect .",
    "one must be careful , though , since a truncated membership will both offset the position of the measured group barycenter away from the slice edge and bias the measure of @xmath83 itself toward small values .",
    "thus , a group which in fact extends over a slice border could still be accidentally included in the clean sample .",
    "therefore , choosing an edge - proximity rejection criterion of @xmath84  although still not perfect  is much safer .",
    "one could even make more stringent demands , requiring groups in the clean sample to be at least three or four times their measured @xmath83 from a slice edge . here",
    ", however , one must worry about biasing the clean sample unnecessarily towards only the most compact systems . in table  2 , we see the effects of steadily increasing the threshold of edge - proximity rejection on the resulting clean samples : although the sample line - of - sight velocity dispersion , @xmath74 , is not strongly affected , the sample pairwise separation and harmonic radius [ @xmath85 ; see column ( 14 ) of table  1 ] both drop precipitously for these larger values of the rejection criterion .",
    "therefore , as a compromise , we have chosen a value of @xmath84 .",
    "our second caveat is that the clean sample is not necessarily the best sample to use for all purposes . since the clean sample excludes groups containing 55-arcsec `` orphans '' , on average this sample discriminates against groups with dense cores . on some occasions ( as in ",
    "6 ) , a superset of the clean sample ",
    "one which does not exclude groups merely because they harbor an `` orphan ''  is the preferred catalogue . the clean sample , as defined",
    ", however , is the most conservative catalogue  the sample with the fewest extrinsic assumptions attached to it .",
    "therefore , in matters of discussing intrinsic mean group properties , we shall use this clean group sample .    with these caveats in mind",

    "the values tabulated for the eight non - lcrs group catalogues have been taken from the original papers , and , where necessary , these values were converted to be consistent with the property definitions detailed in   4 .",
    "the median properties for the lcrs catalogue were derived from the clean sample of 394 groups ; the fraction of grouped galaxies , from the full sample of 1495 groups .",
    "we have broken the lcrs groups catalogue into three sub - catalogues for the purpose of inter - comparison ; the sub - catalogues include the lcrs groups from 50-fiber fields , the lcrs groups from 112-fiber fields , and the lcrs groups which straddle a 50/112 border .",
    "furthermore , we can compare the present lcrs group catalogue with a precursor based upon the lcrs @xmath160 slice ( tucker 1994 ; henceforth , t94 ) . the properties of these lcrs group samples are tabulated under the lcrs main heading in table  4 .",
    "note that there is substantial variation in group properties among the three sub - catalogues .",
    "these variations are also apparent in figures 11  19 .",
    "first , we can discount the oddities apparent in the 50/112 group properties due to poor number statistics ( there are only 5 of these groups in the clean sample ) and due to the difficulties of linking group members across a 50/112 border . in any case , if not for its aberrantly large @xmath74 s  which in turn affect estimates of @xmath133 and @xmath145  the 50/112 sample properties would closely match those of the 50-fiber sample .",
    "unfortunately , the discrepancies between the 50- and the 112-fiber samples group properties are somewhat harder to dismiss .",
    "great effort was put forth into accounting for field - to - field sampling variations in the group - finding algorithm , including using appropriate luminosity functions and surface brightness cutoff functions for each of the northern 50-fiber , the southern 50-fiber , the northern 112-fiber , and the southern 112-fiber field types ( lin et al .",
    "apparently , some small residual selection bias between the 50- and 112-fields remains .",
    "fortunately , we can still follow one of two options : ( 1 ) we can choose to ignore the 50-fiber groups altogether ( they make up only @xmath161 of the total number of groups ) , or ( 2 ) we can note that both the 50-fiber and the 112-fiber group properties fall within the general range of typical group properties from other surveys (   5.2 ) and thus consider the combined lcrs group catalogue as being representative of groups as a whole . unless otherwise noted , we will take the latter course in the following sections .",
    "finally , consider the properties from an earlier version of the lcrs group catalogue ( t94 ) .",
    "this group catalogue is composed of only 50-fiber data from the lcrs @xmath160 slice , so it is not surprising that many of its general properties have values which approximate those of the present 50-fiber sample .",
    "one major difference is the percentage of galaxies in groups .",
    "the relatively small value for the t94 sample may be attributed at least in part to the fact that the earlier lcrs group - finding algorithm ignored 55-arcsec `` orphans , '' thus disrupting many groups into doublets or isolated galaxies which were excluded from the resulting t94 catalogue .",
    "it is instructive to compare the lcrs group catalogue with those derived from other galaxy redshift surveys . in this section",
    "we shall look at nine other group catalogues extracted from five different surveys and relate their properties to those of lcrs groups .",
    "the nine group catalogues considered are those by gh83 , nw87 , n93 , mfw93 , mdcl89 , rgh89 , rpg97 , tb98 , and rzz99 .",
    "the five surveys are the cfa1 ( huchra et al .",
    "1983 ) , the ssrs ( da costa et al .",
    "1988,1991 ) , the cfa2 ( de  lapparent , geller , & huchra 1988 ; huchra et al .",
    "1990 ; huchra , geller , & corwin 1995 ) , the pps ( giovannelli & haynes 1993 ; wegner , haynes , & giovanelli 1993 ) , and the esp ( vettolani et al .  1997 ) .",
    "table  5 summarizes the general properties of the different survey samples used to generate these group catalogues ; for comparison , the characteristics of the lcrs sample used in this paper are also included ( note that the lcrs sample contains substantially more galaxies and encloses the largest volume of any of the survey samples listed ) .",
    "the interested reader is urged to consult the original papers for details .",
    "now , as one might suspect from the small - but - statistically - significant differences between subsamples of the lcrs group catalogue (   5.1 ; figs .",
    "11  19 ) , it is unlikely that another group catalogue  extracted from a different survey with different galaxy selection criteria using another variation of a `` friends - of - friends '' group - finding algorithm  would be from the same statistical parent population of groups as the lcrs group catalogue . to verify this ,",
    "we have used the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test to compare the physical properties of the lcrs groups with those of the five group catalogues available in machine - readable form ( gh83 , mdcl89 , rpg97 , tb98 , and rzz99 ) .",
    "the results of our analysis are shown in figures  21  27 and summarized in table  6 .",
    "notice that most of the formal ks probabilities are so low that we needed to list them in logarithmic form in order to make table  6 readable .",
    "thus , these group catalogues are not extracted from the same parent population as the lcrs groups : their properties , although roughly similar ( table  4 ) , do differ significantly .",
    "there is a hidden benefit in these very low ks probabilities .",
    "the other four group catalogues are not available in machine - readable form ( and two of those were not even published in paper form ) .",
    "since these four have roughly the same number statistics and variations in physical properties as the other five , we can with some safety assume that the physical properties of the groups from these four catalogues also differ significantly from those of the lcrs group sample .",
    "we can therefore exploit the one statistic that is published for the properties of all nine of these group catalogues  the median  as a reasonable measure of comparison .",
    "now , in comparison with these other group catalogues , it is clear from table  4 that the median properties of the full lcrs group catalogue ( those under the `` all '' heading ) are fairly typical .",
    "this is comforting , since it shows that all these group catalogues are looking at roughly the same sort of systems .",
    "but can more be said ? due to differing survey characteristics and differing group - extracting parameters , it is notoriously difficult to make cross - catalogue comparisons .",
    "nonetheless , rough comparisons can be made .",
    "of the properties that table  4 lists , two are primarily @xmath162-dependent ( @xmath116@xmath85@xmath163 , @xmath116@xmath83@xmath163 ) , one is primarily @xmath24-dependant ( @xmath116@xmath164@xmath163 ) , and several are dependent in more - or - less complex ways on both @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( # of groups in catalogue , # of groups in clean sample , % of galaxies in groups , @xmath116@xmath165@xmath166 , @xmath116@xmath133@xmath163 , @xmath116@xmath137@xmath163 , @xmath116@xmath145@xmath163 ) .",
    "let us designate the properties which depend primarily only on @xmath23 _ or _",
    "@xmath24 as _ simply derived _ properties , and those that depend more complexly on both @xmath23 _ and _ @xmath24 as _ complexly derived _ properties . of the simply derived properties ,",
    "those depending mainly on @xmath23 can be considered density defining quantities ; the one that mainly depends on @xmath24 ( @xmath116@xmath164@xmath163 ) defines the mean gravitational energy content of the systems . many of the complexly derived properties are straightforward functions of combinations of the simply derived properties ( see   4 ) .",
    "let us first consider the simply derived properties .",
    "what can we say about the relative mean densities of the groups from the different catalogues ?",
    "consider @xmath116@xmath85@xmath163 .",
    "for the catalogues which on average contain the denser groups , @xmath116@xmath85@xmath163 should be relatively small . under this criterion",
    ", we find that the tb98 and rpg97 catalogues contain the densest systems on average ; the lcrs , gh83 , mdcl89 , rgh89 , and n93 catalogues , those of average density ; and the nw87 catalogue , the least dense .",
    "@xmath116@xmath83@xmath163 is another indicator of relative group density , and , albeit with some changes in rank , roughly the same trend is seen .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the tb98 and rpg97 groups are the densest on average ; the lcrs , gh83 , mdcl89 , rgh89 , and n93 groups are average systems ; and the nw87 groups are the least dense .",
    "next , what can we infer about the mean gravitational energy content of the various catalogues  i.e , which are the `` hottest '' systems , the systems with the highest @xmath116@xmath164@xmath163 ? from table  4 , we see that the gh83 and rgh89 catalogues have high @xmath116@xmath164@xmath163 , the lcrs , mdcl89 , rpg97 , tb98 , and rzz99 catalogues have intermediate values , and the nw87 , n93 , and mfw93 catalogues are the `` coolest '' of the systems listed ( this is a reflection in part on the functional forms of the linking lengths used in nw87 , n93 , and mfw93 , which strongly limit velocity outliers ) .",
    "the values for the complexly derived quantities are by their very natures less certain .",
    "we will consider three specifically  @xmath116@xmath133@xmath163 , @xmath116@xmath165@xmath163 , and @xmath116@xmath145@xmath163 .",
    "consider @xmath116@xmath133@xmath163 : the gh83 and the rgh89 systems are the most massive , followed in order of decreasing mass by the lcrs , the rpg97 , the mdcl89 , the nw87 , and the tb98 systems .",
    "it may seem strange that the catalogue containing the densest systems ( tb98 ) is also the catalogue with the least massive systems .",
    "in fact , this is a consequence of the relatively small linking lengths @xmath23 that tb98 used to extract his groups from the pps : his groups do not extend out to the same radii as those in the `` looser '' catalogues , so they enclose less mass . on the other hand , his groups are the most virialized systems in table  4 ( based upon their short crossing times ) , so his catalogue estimate for @xmath116@xmath133@xmath114 is probably the most accurate .",
    "( the lcrs groups catalogue have a somewhat longer median crossing time , but one can still expect a large fraction of them to be virialized  see equation  34 . )",
    "we can also ask which group catalogues give evidence for the most ( or least ) dark matter .",
    "the lcrs group catalogue has a @xmath116@xmath145@xmath166 of @xmath167 in the lcrs @xmath7-band ; if we convert this to the de  vaucouleurs @xmath147-band ( equation  39 ) used by the other group catalogues with measured mass - to - light ratios , we find @xmath116@xmath145@xmath168 .",
    "this is fairly average . of the other group catalogues with measured values of @xmath116@xmath145@xmath163 ,",
    "the n93 and rgh89 catalogues show lower mass - to - light ratios , and the rpg97 and nw87 show higher .    in conclusion , we can state the lcrs group catalogue is quite average in its simply derived properties  its groups are of average density and gravitional energy content .",
    "furthermore , it is not particularly distinct in its complexly derived properties  the groups being moderately massive with relatively long crossing times and average mass - to - light ratios .",
    "it is , however , a very large catalogue of groups in a wide variety of environments .",
    "the lcrs values for the properties tabulated here are among the least - biased presently available .",
    "the original abell catalogue ( abell 1958 ) is comprised of 2712 rich , highly dense clusters in the northern sky . revised and expanded to include southern clusters , an updated abell catalogue ( aco ) now contains 4073 rich clusters over a significant fraction of the whole sky .",
    "each cluster contains within a projected radius of @xmath169 ( @xmath170  mpc ) from its center at least 30 member galaxies in the magnitude range @xmath152 to @xmath171 , where @xmath152 is the apparent magnitude of the third brightest cluster member .",
    "the abell / aco catalogue nominally encompasses a redshift range of @xmath172 ; the redshifts are estimated empirically based upon the apparent magnitude of the tenth brightest member , @xmath173 , and tend to be accurate to within a factor of 2 .",
    "each cluster is classified according to distance class @xmath174 , estimated from @xmath173 , and according to richness class @xmath7 , based on the number of members meeting the above criteria for projected radial distance and apparent brightness .",
    "furthermore , a supplementary catalogue of southern clusters too poor or too distant to be included in the main catalogue contains an additional 1174 clusters ( abell s001 ",
    "s1174 ) .    how many abell clusters do we expect to identify within the lcrs group catalogue ?",
    "there are 206 abell clusters ( including those from the supplementary catalogue ) within the sky - projected confines of the six lcrs slices . if we confine ourselves to a superset of the clean sample ",
    "one which includes groups with 55  arcsec `` orphans '' meeting the other criteria for inclusion into the clean sample  there are 735 lcrs loose groups which could be matched .",
    "the abell catalogue is purported to be complete to a redshift of 0.20 , but the lcrs group catalogue only goes to a redshift of 0.15 ; so we expect @xmath175 of abell clusters to be lost due to distance .",
    "furthermore , if we assume a typical pairwise separation of @xmath176  mpc , the effective volume of the lcrs slices for the superset sample is again reduced by about half .",
    "therefore , we expect about @xmath177 matches between abell clusters and lcrs groups .",
    "we find 54 matches , which are described in table  7 .",

    "column ( 14 ) : the angular separation in arcminutes between the measured group center and the abell cluster center as reported by aco .",
    "a group - cluster pair was considered a `` match '' if this angular separation was less than 12  arcmin ( @xmath188  mpc at the median redshift of the lcrs ) .    of these matches",
    ", we see that some are quite good ( @xmath189 , separation @xmath190 6  arcmin , convergent cluster distance / group redshift , distance class @xmath116 6 ) , such as the match between lclg-42  010 and abell  2758 , and that others are not so good ( separation @xmath191 6  arcmin , widely divergent cluster distance / group redshift ) . of the latter , some of the lcrs groups are likely in the foreground ( lclg-39  172 , lclg-39  202 ) or in the background ( lclg-03  126 , lclg-39  256 , lclg-42  052 , lclg-42  234 ) .",
    "furthermore , some abell clusters have been split into two or more groups by the `` friends - of - friends '' algorithm ( abell  1200 , s418 , 2969 , s281 , s253 , s286 ) .",
    "all in all , however , the matchups are not too bad , especially for those groups with @xmath192 observed members and those clusters of abell distance class @xmath193 .",
    "if we consider just the non - split @xmath194 matches , we find by least - squares fit that @xmath195 ( eq . [ 41 ] ; see fig .",
    "such a poor correspondence between @xmath196 and @xmath187 may be disheartening at first  at least until one realizes that independent measures of @xmath187 among abell , corwin , and olowin _ themselves _ often had random and systematic offsets of up to 50 galaxy counts ( see aco , figs .  6 & 7 ) .",
    "furthermore , aco stress that the measured counts for individual clusters are nearly meaningless .",
    "therefore , we also stress that @xmath151 ( or the corresponding @xmath187 from eq .",
    "[ 31 ] ) for individual lcrs groups will likely be very noisy ; it is better to consider mean or median values of these estimates for sets of lcrs groups .",
    "for instance , the median @xmath151 for lcrs groups is 10.8 ( fig .",
    "this value for @xmath151 indicates a median @xmath197 , which implies that lcrs groups , on average , can be thought of as very poor clusters .",
    "( the negative values for the median counts is based in part to the different means of background subtraction used here and in aco . )",
    "clearly , the lcrs groups do define an environment intermediate between that of isolated galaxies and that of rich clusters .",
    "we have presented in this paper a catalogue of loose groups within the lcrs .",
    "these groups were extracted from the lcrs galaxy catalogue by means of a standard huchra - geller `` friends - of - friends '' percolation algorithm , modified for comoving distances and for the field - to - field sampling variations characteristic of this redshift survey .",
    "internal comparisons of characteristics within the lcrs group catalogue indicated some minor differences between groups extracted from the 50-fiber fields and those extracted from the 112-fiber fields .",
    "we attributed these differences to some small but still - hidden residual selection bias between galaxies in the 50-fiber and in the 112-fiber fields .",
    "since groups in the 50-fiber sample comprise only @xmath161 of the lcrs group catalogue , and since the properties of both the 50-fiber and the 112-fiber groups fall within the general regime of other group catalogues , we found this discrepancy to be of only minor importance .",
    "external comparison of the lcrs group catalogue with nine other group catalogues , all based upon other redshift surveys , showed that the general properties of lcrs groups are quite typical of current group catalogues .",
    "nonetheless , it , along with the esp group catalogue ( rzz99 ) , is the only group catalogue based upon a redshift survey covering a reasonably fair sample of the local universe .",
    "therefore , the properties of the lcrs group catalogue , containing groups from a wide range of environments , should be among the least biased to date .",
    "matchups of the lcrs groups with abell clusters indicated , not surprisingly , that , on average , these groups are much poorer than abell - class clusters , and therefore that lcrs groups do indeed inhabit a range of parameter space intermediate to that of individual galaxies and to that of rich clusters .    we therefore conclude that this catalogue will be useful for a variety of studies requiring an unbiased census of loose groups , including the measurement of the luminosity function of group members versus that of field galaxies , the investigation of various morphology - environment relations , and the study of the clustering of groups .",

    "a further complication exists in that the linking radius employed in the `` friends - of - friends '' percolation algorithm is only @xmath208 1  @xmath65  mpc at the fiducial redshift @xmath249 ; for some tightly configured groups containing only a few observed members , the full abell radius of 1.5  @xmath65  mpc ( projected ) may not be completely searched , resulting in underestimates of the abell counts @xmath233 .",
    "since most lcrs groups are not very tightly configured ( consider the mean pairwise separations , @xmath83 ) , this is not likely to be a significant effect for the catalogue as a whole . in a similar case ,",
    "apm clusters , which number counts only within a projected radius of 0.75  @xmath65  mpc from the cluster center , have been shown to underestimate their abell counts typically by only @xmath208 20% or less ( bahcall & west 1992 ) .",
    "the lcrs percolation algorithm , with its relatively large linking parameter @xmath23 ( typically @xmath250  mpc ) , should perform much better than do the apm counts .    when compared with actual abell clusters within the lcrs volume , we find the following relation between the lcrs group counts estimate , @xmath151 , and the revised abell cluster values given by aco , @xmath187 : @xmath195 ( eq .
