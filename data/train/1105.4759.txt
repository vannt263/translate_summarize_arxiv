    "in the early universe , astrochemistry is still almost unexplored . observations of dwarf galaxies with low metallicities and spectral scans of ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) in the local universe are a great help , not only in getting a better understanding of these interesting classes of targets , but also to improve our knowledge on molecular cloud properties and star formation under exotic conditions resembling to a certain extent those in the distant past .",
    "however , in the end  in spite of all difficulties related to their large distances  nothing can replace direct detailed studies of the high-@xmath14 sources themselves .    while there have been some attempts to search for molecules other than co at @xmath15 ( e.g. hcn , hnc , cn ; @xcite ) , the number of detected species is still fairly small .",
    "right now we only see the tip of the iceberg and a broader set of observational data is mandatory .",
    "one of the most promising molecules for studies of the early universe is heh@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "hydrogen and helium are the main components of matter in the universe .",
    "available chemical models predict heh@xmath0 to be one of the most abundant molecules in the post - recombination era ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "several authors analysed heh@xmath0 formation and excitation in astrophysical plasmas and in various nebulae ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "they found that the heh@xmath0 abundance can be particularly high in vicinity of strong extreme uv and x - ray emitting sources , sufficient to produce an observable line emission .    despite of the expectations",
    "this molecule has not been detected in space yet . with the iso lws instrument",
    "@xcite detected an emission feature at the frequency of the heh@xmath0 @xmath1 transition at 149.18  @xmath16 m in the planetary nebula ngc7027 .",
    "however , their analysis shows that this feature is most probably attributed to the ch @xmath3 fundamental pure rotational lines at nearby frequencies ( the iso lws spectral resolution was insufficient to separate these lines ) .",
    "nevertheless , we may expect a rather high abundance of heh@xmath0 in dense clouds near distant quasars where its cosmological abundance can be drastically enhanced by local energetic processes . some other simple molecules ( e.g. ch ) may also be sufficiently abundant .",
    "we report here results of a search for heh@xmath0 and ch in the spectrum of one of the highest - redshift quasars , sdss j114816.64 + 525150.3 ( @xmath5 ) . a rather strong emission in the redshifted @xmath17 fine - structure line of c@xmath0 at 157.74 @xmath16 m was detected there using the iram 30-m telescope @xcite , in addition to co emission detected earlier @xcite .",
    "here we report on a search for the heh@xmath0(10 ) line ( @xmath2 = 2010.183873ghz , @xcite ) and simultaneously for the ch @xmath3 lines ( @xmath4 2006.8 and 2010.8ghz , @xcite ) in this object . due to the redshift these lines fall into the frequency interval from 270.5  ghz to 271  ghz which can be readily observed at the 30-m iram telescope .",
    "the observations were performed in january 2011 in a pool observing session at the iram 30 m radio telescope in the dual beam switching mode using wobbler switching with a beam throw of @xmath18 towards the nominal source position of @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "the receiver at both polarizations was tuned to the red - shifted heh@xmath0 frequency , equal to 270.954437  ghz .",
    "the system temperature varied from @xmath21  k to @xmath22  k. the total integration time was about 20 hours .",
    "the antenna hpbw at this frequency is about 9  arcsec .",
    "pointing was checked approximately every 1.5 hours and was found to be stable within @xmath23 arcsec .",
    "the results are presented on an antenna temperature scale , @xmath24 , corrected for aperture blocking and for atmospheric attenuation .",
    "we used two spectral backends in parallel : the wilma autocorrelator with a 2  mhz channel width and the filter bank with a 4  mhz channel width .",
    "both backends had 4  ghz total bandwidth .",
    "the data reduction was performed with the gildas software package .",
    "the data set consists of about 250 individual spectral scans . each scan was checked visually ; several apparently corrupted scans were omitted . with the wilma backend",
    "many scans show spurious spikes in a few individual channels .",
    "however these channels are located well outside the expected frequency range for our lines and no special measures were made to exclude these spikes .",
    "on the other hand some spectra obtained with the filter bank suffer from a strong baseline curvature on rather large scales which can affect final results .",
    "an average spectrum obtained with the wilma autocorrelator smoothed to a 16  mhz ( 18  kms@xmath8 ) resolution after subtraction of a zero - order baseline is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : w - aver ] .",
    "the expected frequencies of the heh@xmath0 and ch lines are indicated .",
    "the shaded area shows the frequency range approximately corresponding to the width of the co and c@xmath0 lines at the half intensity level ( 300  kms@xmath8 ) .     +    according to the common detection criterion ( @xmath25 )",
    "there is no detected line in this spectrum .",
    "the rms noise in this 16  mhz resolution spectrum is @xmath6  mk ( @xmath7  mjy using a conversion factor of 8.4  jy / k ) .    at the same time",
    "one can see a possible emission feature in our spectrum close to the expected heh@xmath0 frequency .",
    "a formal gaussian fit gives for the integrated intensity @xmath26  mk@xmath11mhz or @xmath10  jy@xmath11kms@xmath8 , i.e. the signal to noise ratio is about 2.9 .",
    "the line width is @xmath27  mhz or @xmath28  kms@xmath8 .",
    "the feature is shifted by @xmath29  kms@xmath8 from the expected frequency of the heh@xmath0 line . as mentioned above",
    "this shift is well within the width of the line profiles for co and c@xmath0 .    in order to check further the significance of this result",
    "we split the data set into two approximately equal parts and analysed them separately .",
    "the average spectra for these parts are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2halves ] .",
    "both spectra show hints for the emission features in the same frequency range .",
    "the same feature is seen in the spectrum obtained with the filter bank ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4 m ] ) although the baseline here is worse than in the wilma spectrum .",
    "we conclude that we have obtained a very tentative detection of an emission line which can be attributed to heh@xmath0 , while there is no sign for ch emission or absorption .     +     +",
    "what could be the reason for the differences in velocity and width between this tentative heh@xmath0 line and the detected lines of co and c@xmath0 ? as shown by @xcite the heh@xmath0 emission should arise mostly from edges of dense ionized regions . according to these works",
    "heh@xmath0 can be effectively excited by electron impacts .",
    "the required electron density is @xmath30  @xmath31 .",
    "collisional excitation of heh@xmath0 by neutrals requires very high densities and seems to be unlikely .",
    "therefore , our tentatively detected line could be produced in dense ionized regions in this qso .",
    "it would then not be surprising that its central velocity and velocity dispersion are different from those of the neutral molecular gas traced by co and c@xmath0 .",
    "for example , high ionization uv lines in this object have a velocity offset of @xmath32  kms@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning also that presumably strong uv and x - ray emissions of this very luminous qso , which probably harbours a @xmath33  m@xmath13 black hole in the center @xcite , create favourable conditions for heh@xmath0 formation .",
    "the total luminosity in the line , if real , can be estimated as @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the line luminosity in l@xmath13 , @xmath36 is the line rest frequency in ghz , @xmath37 is the luminosity distance in mpc and @xmath38 is the velocity integrated flux density in jykms@xmath8 . using the cosmology calculator @xcite with the `` standard '' cosmological parameters ( @xmath39  kms@xmath8mpc@xmath8 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) we obtain @xmath42  mpc .",
    "then , @xmath12  l@xmath13 . until a reliable confirmation the estimates of the line intensity and luminosity",
    "should be considered rather as upper limits .",
    "our data provide no clear detection of either heh@xmath0 or ch in a high - redshift ( @xmath5 ) qso sdss j114816.64 + 525150.3 where a rather strong emission in several atomic and molecular lines has been detected earlier .",
    "however , there is a possible ( at a level of @xmath9 ) emission feature which can be attributed to the heh@xmath0 @xmath43 line .",
    "this feature is shifted by about 100  kms@xmath8 from the expected frequency of the heh@xmath0 line derived from the co and c@xmath0 line redshifts and is about 4 times narrower than these lines .",
    "this shift is well within the width of the line profiles for co and c@xmath0 .",
    "the difference in velocities as well as in the line widths can be explained by quite different conditions required for formation and excitation of heh@xmath0 on the one hand and co as well as c@xmath0 on the other hand .",
    "the heh@xmath0 emission could probably arise in dense ionized gas in this qso .",
    "the velocity integrated flux in this tentative line is @xmath10  jy@xmath11kms@xmath8 which corresponds to the total luminosity in the line of @xmath12  l@xmath13 .",
    "prior to a reliable confirmation , these values should be considered rather as upper limits .",
