    "the next step is different : we apply poisson summation formula while  @xcite applies weil s bound for kloosterman sums . as explained in the introduction , this yields much less savings . taking also into account the remaining terms which are difficult to estimate , this explains why the exponent @xmath163 obtained in  @xcite is really much larger .",

    "a key difference in their approach and ours is that we apply petersson trace formula and  @xcite apply selberg trace formula .",
    "the case of a general level @xmath5 ( square - free or not ) is delicate and the reader is referred to  @xcite for a clear solution .",
    "a lower bound for @xmath167 is obtained in  @xcite*theorem 3.3 as the logarithm of the sum of the volume , the number of cusps , the number of elliptic elements and the number of exceptional eigenvalues . as a consequence , in  @xcite*5.2",

    "as a consequence , in  @xcite*5.3 it is deduced an upper bound @xmath171 .",
    "it seems difficult to improve this growth from the geometric bound , in particular one needs both to control the number of short geodesics ( which is done using results of huxley ) and the huber constant ( which is discussed @xcite*remark 4.10 and @xcite ) .",
