    "in this note i perform a study of su(3 ) breaking for the decays @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "this system is interesting , because it allows for a determination of the angle @xmath2 from mixing - induced and direct cp asymmetries @xcite provided the su(3 ) symmetry breaking corrections to a certain double ratio of amplitudes are known .",
    "the analysis of su(3 ) breaking is done in the theoretical framework of qcd factorization @xcite , which expresses the hadronic decay amplitudes in terms of fundamental constants , decay constants , form factors etc . in the heavy quark limit .",
    "the following is a preliminary version of work in progress in collaboration with m. neubert .",
    "we write the decay amplitudes as @xmath3 where @xmath4 .",
    "the `` tree '' and `` penguin '' amplitudes are defined as the coefficients of the two terms with different ckm matrix elements .",
    "they also contain subleading penguin , electroweak penguin and weak annihilation amplitudes . in the su(3 )",
    "symmetry limit @xmath5 and @xmath6",
    ". we will be interested in the deviations of the ratios @xmath7 from unity .",
    "the ratio of tree amplitudes is the product of a factorizable and a non - factorizable term , @xmath8 .",
    "the factorizable term is given by @xmath9 where we have included the light meson masses and phase space effects .",
    "the @xmath10 form factor is taken from @xcite , but the assumed value for the @xmath11 form factor is only an `` educated guess '' . in the context of qcd sum rules",
    "this form factor is expected to depend sensitively on the poorly known first gegenbauer moment of the kaon light - cone distribution amplitude , since the form factor is dominated by the soft spectator - quark overlap term .",
    "the factorizable su(3 ) breaking correction cancels in the double ratio @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this ratio and @xmath13 deviate from unity due to non - factorizable effects that can be computed in qcd factorization assuming that @xmath14 .",
    "the computation is a straightforward extension of the results of @xcite .",
    "i refer to this paper and @xcite for all details concerning the method and the values of the hadronic parameters .",
    "the parameters relevant to su(3 ) breaking are :    * @xmath15 vs.  @xmath16 in the normalization of scalar penguin terms ; * the ratio @xmath17 vs.   @xmath18 in the normalization of the hard - scattering and weak annihilation terms ; * the gegenbauer moments @xmath19 , @xmath20 vs.  @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and the first inverse moments of the @xmath23-meson distribution amplitudes , @xmath24 vs.  @xmath25 ; * the parameters for soft power corrections from hard scattering and weak annihilation , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "since these parameters are often not well - known , we will make assumptions on the su(3 ) breaking and exhibit the effect of these assumptions on the ratios @xmath13 and @xmath12 .",
    "this should be distinguished from more ambitious approaches as discussed in @xcite , where the su(3 ) breaking in the input parameters is also computed",
    ".    for a given pair of related parameters denoted @xmath28 , for instance @xmath29 , we set all other parameters and @xmath30 to their standard values .",
    "we then write @xmath31 and vary @xmath32 , which controls the amount of su(3 ) breaking , between @xmath33 and 0.3 . for the complex parameters @xmath27 and @xmath26 we vary the magnitude and phase simultaneously and independently by this amount .",
    "we make two exceptions to this treatment . for the light meson gegenbauer moments , which are already small corrections to the su(3 )",
    "symmetric asymptotic distribution amplitudes , we take @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "second , we use @xmath37 with @xmath38 taken from @xcite .",
    "the resulting variations of the magnitudes and phases of @xmath13 and @xmath12 about their default values @xmath39 are shown in the upper part of table  [ tab : su3 ] .",
    "adding up the various uncertainties we obtain non - factorizable su(3 ) breaking effects of order @xmath40 for the ratio of tree amplitudes and of order @xmath41 for the double ratio of penguin and tree amplitudes .",
    "since the strong phases of the ratios are very small , the su(3 ) breaking effect on the phases is also small in absolute magnitude .",
    "these estimates have to be regarded with caution , since they rely on the default estimate of weak annihilation ( @xmath42 ) , in which the annihilation amplitude does not have a strong phase . to study the impact of weak annihilation in more detail we pick the four values @xmath43 corresponding to @xmath44 with phase 0 , 90 , 180 , 270 degrees for the pion mode and allow the corresponding parameters to vary by @xmath45 for the kaon mode .",
    "all the values of the annihilation parameter chosen by this procedure lie ( almost ) within our standard error assumption @xmath46",
    ". the lower part of table  [ tab : su3 ] demonstrates that the su(3 ) breaking effect on the ratio of penguin amplitudes can be large , up to @xmath47 in magnitude and @xmath48 on the phase of @xmath12 .",
    "we conclude that unless a better understanding of su(3 ) breaking effects in the weak annihilation amplitude is found the assumption @xmath49 should not be made .",
    ".[tab : su3 ] su(3 ) breaking effect on the magnitude and phase of @xmath13 and @xmath12 for variations of a given input parameter as described in the text . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "to estimate the theoretical uncertainty in the determination of the angle @xmath2 due to the su(3 ) breaking effects , we assume that the mixing phase @xmath50 is @xmath51 , corresponding to @xmath52 , and define the time - dependent cp asymmetry through @xmath53     & = & - s_f \\sin(\\delta m_b\\,t ) + c_f \\cos(\\delta m_b\\,t ) \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we assume that @xmath54 and @xmath55 have been measured",
    ". we can then determine @xmath56}{t_\\pi}\\ ] ] as a function of @xmath2 , differs from @xcite by a sign , so that @xmath57 is near zero in qcd factorization . ] and predict @xmath58 , the direct cp asymmetry in @xmath59 decay , for a given assumed value of the su(3 ) breaking ratio @xmath12 .",
    "a measurement of @xmath58 then results in a determination of @xmath2 with a theoretical error due to the uncertainty of @xmath12 .",
    "we dismiss solutions with @xmath60 as unphysical , since a large penguin amplitude is or will be excluded by branching fraction measurements .",
    "we generically find two solutions for @xmath61 .",
    "the second solution satisfies @xmath62 only in a small range around @xmath63 and will not be discussed further .",
    "the other solution already constrains @xmath64 from @xmath62 alone .",
    "the question is how a measurement of @xmath58 narrows this range further . in figure",
    "[ fig : su3 ] we show @xmath58 as a function of @xmath2 for five values of @xmath12 : the central value according to ( [ rptdef ] ) , and for the most pessimistic error assumptions corresponding to @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the figure also shows @xmath69 and @xmath70 .    the cp asymmetry exhibits a resonance - like behaviour after @xmath69 has gone through its minimal value , since the denominator of the expression for @xmath58 goes through a minimum when @xmath71 becomes small and positive .",
    "we find that the largest error is introduced by the uncertainty in the phase of @xmath12 , which in our analysis is entirely due to weak annihilation .",
    "for instance , if @xmath72 is found , the strategy would determine two values of @xmath2 in the absence of theoretical ( and experimental ) errors . including the su(3 ) breaking error",
    ", we obtain @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "since @xmath70 is expected to be positive , the second range is theoretically favored . in general , the theoretical error can become larger or smaller depending on @xmath58 as seen from the figure .",
    "it will also depend on what the mixing - induced and direct cp asymmetries in @xmath75 will eventually turn out to be , but our result should be generic .    we therefore conclude that the strategy to determine @xmath2 from the @xmath75 to @xmath76 system _ may _ suffer from considerable theoretical uncertainties , unless additional information is available .",
    "this can come from two sources : ( 1 ) excluding the possibility of a weak annihilation amplitude with a large strong rescattering phase would already eliminate the largest uncertainty that we could identify in the context of qcd factorization .",
    "this could be achieved experimentally by excluding a large direct cp asymmetry in @xmath77 and neglecting su(3 ) breaking effects in the estimate of the weak annihilation phase .",
    "( 2 ) if the @xmath78 mixing phase is known , the mixing - induced cp asymmetry in @xmath59 decay provides a fourth observable , which could be used to determine ( or eliminate ) @xmath57 , leaving only the su(3 ) breaking error on @xmath69 . to make this work in practice ,",
    "a significant experimental effort is required .",
