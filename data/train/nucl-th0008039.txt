    "( [ donsi ] ) , we obtain an average total kaon production cross section of @xmath69 = 65  @xmath70b for central @xmath52 collisions at 2 agev .",

    "note that the inclusion of even a slight modification of the @xmath1 mass because of the nuclear medium ( without the corresponding changes introduced here ) leads to a substantial reduction of the inclusive @xmath1 spectra ( by as much as a factor of 2 or 3 ) , compared to that calculated using the free space properties for the relevant hadrons  @xcite .    we stress that at sis energies reaction channels with a @xmath71-hyperon in the final state play a minor role , because of the upper limit of the energy available in the collisions .",
    "the downwardly shifted @xmath38 reaction threshold at small densities is still quite high .",
    "our present study shows that if one accounts for the in - medium modification of the production amplitude ( i.e. , the in - medium properties of the @xmath1-meson and hadrons ) correctly , it is possible to understand @xmath1 production data in heavy ion collisions at sis energies , even if the @xmath1-meson feels the theoretically expected , repulsive mean field potential . the apparent failure to explain the @xmath1 production data",
    "if one includes the purely kinematic effects of the in - medium modification of the @xmath1-meson and hadrons , appears to be a consequence of the omission of these effects on the reaction amplitudes .",
