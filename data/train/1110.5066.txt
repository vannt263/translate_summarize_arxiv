    "an amorphous solid reacts to an instantaneous affine shear deformation with the infinite frequency shear modulus @xmath1 .",
    "but the atoms are not in equilibrium then ; there is a non - affine motion of the atoms which lowers the energy @xcite , leading to a lower high - frequency modulus @xmath2 .",
    "this motion is intimately related to the boson peak and to the tunneling states which dominate the glass behavior at very low temperatures @xcite as well as to the plastic modes responsible for the shear thinning in non - newtonian flow @xcite .",
    "@xmath2 is the shear modulus which one measures in a light - scattering brillouin experiment at ghz frequency , a frequency markedly lower than the one of the boson peak .    in undercooled liquids ,",
    "the flow process becomes so slow that one begins to see the shear modulus @xmath2 for high enough frequencies @xcite . according to a very recent replica ( or cloned liquid ) theory result @xcite , the point in temperature where one begins to see the shear modulus is the critical temperature of the mode coupling theory @xcite , though numerical simulations @xcite see it already at a higher temperature .",
    "if one begins to see a high frequency shear modulus , one also has to distinguish between the high - frequency and zero frequency bulk moduli @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively ( @xmath4 is the inverse of the isothermal compressibility ) .",
    "though there is a standard textbook description of the viscoelastic liquid @xcite , there is no theory relating @xmath5 to @xmath2 .",
    "the mode coupling theory does not contain a shear modulus ; in fact , if the new cloned liquid theory result @xcite is correct , the theory is no longer valid at the temperature where the shear modulus appears . the random first order theory",
    "( rfot ) @xcite is supposed to be valid , but the rfot specifies only the entropy and the surface tension of a rearranging region and thus does not supply the needed information .",
    "similarly , the coupling model @xcite does not specify a difference between compression and shear .",
    "the elastic models @xcite postulate a proportionality of the flow barrier to @xmath2 ( one wonders a bit whether they should not propose a proportionality to @xmath1 ) , but they make no selective prediction for compression or shear .",
    "the counting of covalent constraints @xcite allows one to count the number of floppy modes per atom in a given substance , but tells nothing about a compression - shear ratio",
    ".    there are some specific atomic motion models , in particular for close - packed atoms interacting with a simple two - body potential , which do allow a prediction .",
    "one of them is the interstitial model @xcite . in the crystal ,",
    "the interstitial does not couple to an external compression , but only to an external shear @xcite .",
    "another one is the gliding triangle model @xcite , which postulates a shear motion of two adjacent triangles of atoms with respect to each other .",
    "both models predict the compression - shear ratio zero , because there is only a coupling to the shear .",
    "this result is indeed compatible with experiment and simulation in lennard - jones and metallic glasses @xcite , but not in other substances .",
    "the only theoretical concept able to derive a prediction on general grounds is the eshelby picture of local structural rearrangements within an elastic solid @xcite .",
    "the present paper derives a general relation for the compression - shear ratio on this basis .",
    "the paper proceeds by the derivation of the general relation in section ii .",
    "section iii compares to experimental data from glasses and liquids .",
    "section iv concludes and summarizes the paper .",
    "in the eshelby scheme , one considers a strain - free ground state of a volume @xmath6 of @xmath7 atoms or molecules with an atomic or molecular volume @xmath8 , embedded in an elastic matrix with the same elastic constants as the volume itself . a structural rearrangement to an alternative stable structure of the volume changes its shape . to first order ,",
    "the shape change is a pure distortion , describable in terms of the inner volume change @xmath9 and five linearly independent shear angles @xmath10 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    after the rearrangement , both the inner and the outer volume end up in a strained state , because the alternative stable state has a misfit with respect to the matrix .",
    "the resulting elastic strain energy @xmath11 is about half the energy needed to squeeze the new stable state into the old hole without deforming it .",
    "let the initial volume be a sphere . according to eshelby @xcite , for a specific pure volume change @xmath12 @xmath13 where the index @xmath14 stands for a bulk distortion and @xmath15 is the poisson ratio , related to the ratio @xmath16 by @xmath17 the coupling constant @xmath18 to an external volume change @xmath19 is given by @xmath20    similarly @xcite , for a pure shear change @xmath10 @xmath21 where the index @xmath22 stands for a shear distortion .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath23 to an external shear @xmath24 in the direction @xmath10 is @xmath25    for equal asymmetries @xmath26 one has @xmath27    in order to set the volume change on the same energy scale as the shear distortion , one defines the variable @xmath28 with @xmath29    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the experimental values for the tunneling states were taken from the data collections of berret and meissner @xcite , pohl , liu and thompson @xcite and bellessa @xcite .",
    "berret and meissner report values for the tunneling state coupling constants @xmath30 and @xmath31 to longitudinal and transverse sound waves , respectively .",
    "@xmath31 agrees with the @xmath23 of the present paper . for @xmath30 ,",
    "one has the relation @xmath32 because the longitudinal modulus @xmath33 .",
    "thus one can calculate @xmath34 from @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "pohl , liu and thompson @xcite report values of @xmath35 and @xmath36 from tunneling plateaus in the damping of longitudinal and transverse waves at low temperatures in glasses . from these and the sound velocities @xmath37 and @xmath38",
    ", one can again calculate @xmath39 via @xmath40 bellessa @xcite reports values of @xmath41 and @xmath42 from the temperature dependence of the sound velocities at low temperature in selenium and in three metallic glasses , where @xmath43 is the density of tunneling states . from the ratio of these two values",
    ", one can again calculate @xmath0 as from the data of berret and meissner .",
    "the error is large ; if @xmath44 and @xmath45 are measured with an error of 10 % , the error of @xmath0 is 40 % .",
    "but the scatter of the data is even larger than the one expected from the error .",
    "this is a first indication for a large substance dependence of @xmath0 .",
    "table i and table ii compile literature data for the prigogine - defay ratio and the poisson ratio . with these , one can calculate @xmath0 from eq .",
    "( [ dbdg ] ) .",
    "the results in fig . 2 show a similar scatter and a similar dependence on the poisson ratio as those determined from the tunneling states at low temperatures . not only the glass transition data , but also the tunneling state coupling constants follow the theoretical curve of eq .",
    "( [ gbgs ] ) at small poisson ratio @xmath15 . at about @xmath46 ,",
    "the value for central forces in close packing , the values begin to decline away from the theoretical curve , reaching zero at about @xmath47 .",
    "the equality of the coupling ratios at the glass transition and for the low temperature tunneling states is the first main result of the present paper .",
    "note that the few substances in table i and ii where both couplings have been measured show agreement within experimental error .",
    "the second main result is the gradual breakdown of the theoretical prediction as the poisson ratio begins to approach higher values .",
    "obviously , the assumption of a constant density of stable structural states in distortion space , on which the theoretical prediction is based , breaks down as the poisson ratio of the glass approaches the value 1/2 of the liquid .",
    "the reason for this breakdown is not yet clear , but it tends to occur in close - packed systems @xcite .",
    "the eshelby concept of a local structural rearrangement within a surrounding elastic matrix allows to derive the coupling ratio @xmath0 of structural relaxation processes to an external compression and an external shear , respectively . assuming a constant density of stable structures in distortion space , one finds a ratio between one and two , increasing with increasing poisson ratio .",
    "the comparison to literature data from the low temperature tunneling states in glasses provides essentially the same answer as the comparison to literature glass transition data : at low poisson ratio , the theoretical prediction is obeyed , though with a large scatter from a strong substance dependence of the ratio . above the poisson ratio 1/3 , the coupling ratio decreases , reaching zero at a poisson ratio of about 0.4 . at this point , the prigogine - defay ratio of the glass transition reaches unity , implying a perfect correlation of the additional enthalpy and the density fluctuations which distinguish the liquid from the glass .",
