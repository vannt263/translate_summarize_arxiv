    "when the link condition between two d2d ues is too poor for direct communication , the d2d traffic can be transmitted via a relay node , which performs scheduling and resource allocation for the d2d ues .",
    "we refer to this as _ relay - aided d2d communication _ which can be an efficient approach to provide better quality of service ( qos ) for communication between distant d2d ues . for this",

    "we consider scenarios in which the potential d2d ues are located in the same macrocell ; however , the proximity and link condition may not be favorable for direct communication .",
    "therefore , they communicate via relays .",
    "the radio resources ( e.g. , resource blocks [ rbs ] and transmission power ) at the relays are shared among the d2d communication links and the two - hop cellular links .",
    "we formulate an optimization problem to allocate radio resources at a relay node in a muti - relay multi - user orthogonal frequency - division multiple access ( ofdma ) cellular network ( e.g. , lte - a network ) . due to the np - hardness of the resource allocation problem",
    ", we utilize time sharing strategy and provide an asymptotically optimal centralized solution .",
    "considering the random nature of wireless channels , we reformulate the resource allocation problem using the worst - case robust optimization theory . the uncertainties in link gains are modeled using ellipsoidal uncertainty sets .",
    "each relay node can centrally solve the problem taking channel uncertainty into consideration .",
    "however , considering the high ( e.g. , cubic to the number of ues and rbs ) computational overhead at the relay nodes , we provide a _ distributed _ solution based on _ stable matching _ theory which is computationally inexpensive ( e.g. , linear with the number of ues and rbs ) .",
    "we also analyze the stability , uniqueness , and optimality of the proposed solution .",
    "considering the computational and signalling overheads and lack of scalability of the centralized solutions , game theoretical models have been widely used for wireless resource allocation problems .",
    "however , the analytical tractability of equilibrium in such game - theoretical models requires special properties for the objective functions , such as convexity , which may not be satisfied for many practical cases @xcite . in this context",
    ", resource allocation using matching theory has several beneficial properties @xcite .",
    "for example , the stable matching algorithm terminates for every given preference profile .",
    "the outcome of matching provides suitable solutions in terms of stability and optimality , which can accurately reflect different system objectives . besides , with suitable data structures , a pareto optimal stable",
    "matching ( e.g. , allocation of resources to the ues ) can be obtained quickly for online implementation .",
    "the goal of this work is to design a practical radio resource scheme for relay - aided d2d communication in a multi - user multi - relay ofdma network .",
    "as opposed to most of the work in the literature where channel gain information is assumed to be perfect , we capture the dynamics of random and time - varying nature of wireless channels . to this end",
    ", we develop a low - complexity distributed solution based on the theory of stable matching and demonstrate how this scheme can be implemented in a practical lte - a system .",
    "the major contributions of this work can be summarized as follows :    * we model and analyze the radio resource allocation problem for relay - aided d2d communication underlaying an ofdma cellular network considering uncertainties in channel gains .",
    "we formulate an optimization problem to maximize system capacity in a two - hop network while satisfying the minimum data rate requirement for each ue and limiting the interference to other receiving nodes .",
    "we show that the convexity of the optimization problem is conserved under bounded channel uncertainty in both the useful and interference links . *",
    "using the theory of stable matching , we develop a distributed iterative solution , which considers bounded channel uncertainty . the stability , uniqueness , optimality , and complexity of the proposed solution are analyzed .",
    "we also present a possible implementation approach of our proposed scheme in an lte - a system . *",
    "numerical results show that the proposed distributed solution performs close to the upper bound of the optimal solution obtained in a centralized manner ; however , it incurs a lower ( e.g. , linear compared to cubic ) computational complexity . through simulations , we also compare the performance of the proposed approach with a traditional underlay d2d communication scheme and observe that after a distant margin , relaying of d2d traffic improves network performance .",

    "<S> wireless device - to - device ( d2d ) communication underlaying cellular network is a promising concept to improve user experience and resource utilization . unlike traditional d2d communication where two mobile devices in the proximity establish a direct local link bypassing the base station , in this work we focus on relay - aided d2d communication . </S>",
    "<S> relay - aided transmission could enhance the performance of d2d communication when d2d user equipments ( ues ) are far apart from each other and/or the quality of d2d link is not good enough for direct communication . considering the uncertainties in wireless links , we model and analyze the performance of a relay - aided d2d communication network , where the relay nodes serve both the cellular and d2d users . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we formulate the radio resource allocation problem in a two - hop network to guarantee the data rate of the ues while protecting other receiving nodes from interference . utilizing time sharing strategy </S>",
    "<S> , we provide a centralized solution under bounded channel uncertainty . with a view to reducing the computational burden at relay nodes , we propose a distributed solution approach using stable matching to allocate radio resources in an efficient and computationally inexpensive way . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results show that the performance of the proposed method is close to the centralized optimal solution and there is a distance margin beyond which relaying of d2d traffic improves network performance .    </S>",
