    "an undirected graph is formed by a set of vertices and a set of undirected edges , with each edge connecting between two different vertices . a feedback vertex set ( fvs ) for such a graph is a set of vertices intersecting with every cycle of the graph . in other words , the subgraph induced by the vertices outside the fvs contains no cycle ( it is a forest ) @xcite .",
    "the feedback vertex set problem aims at constructing a fvs of small cardinality for a given undirected graph .",
    "it is a fundamental nondeterministic polynomial - complete ( np - complete ) combinatorial optimization problem with global cycle constraints @xcite . in terms of complete algorithms ,",
    "whether a graph @xmath0 has a fvs of cardinality smaller than @xmath1 can be determined in time @xmath2 @xcite . and an fvs of cardinality at most two times the optimal value can be easily constructed by an efficient polynomial algorithm @xcite .",
    "an optimal fvs is a feedback vertex set whose cardinality is the global minimum value among all the feedback vertex sets of the graph . for a given graph",
    ", an optimal fvs can be constructed in an exact way in time @xmath3 @xcite , where @xmath4 denotes the total number of vertices in the graph . applied mathematicians have obtained rigorous lower and upper bounds for the optimal fvs problem @xcite and have proved its tractability for graphs with specific structures",
    "( see for example , @xcite and references cited therein ) .    due to the np - complete nature of the fvs problem , in general it is not feasible to construct optimal feedback vertex sets for large cycle - rich graphs .",
    "an important question is then to design efficent heurstic algorithms that are able to obtain near - optimal fvs solutions for given graph instances .",
    "such a task is quite nontrivial .",
    "a major technical difficulty is that cycles are global objects of a graph and therefore the existence of cycles can not be judged by checking only the neighborhood of a vertext .",
    "( similar difficulties exist in other combinatorial optimization problems with global constraints , such as the steiner tree problem @xcite and the optimal routing problem @xcite . ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , one of the authors succeeded in converting the fvs problem to a spin glass problem with local interactions .",
    "the fvs problem was then studied from the spin glass perspective , and a message - passing algorithm , belief propagation - guided decimaton ( bpd ) , was impletmented to solve the fvs problem heuristically for single graph instances .",
    "this bpd algorithm is quite efficient in terms of computing time and computer memory ( since there is no need of cycle checking ) , and it can obtain fvs solutions that are very close to the optimal ones when applied on large random graph instances and regular lattices @xcite .    for the undirected fvs problem it is not yet known whether simple local search algorithms can achieve equally excellent results as the bpd algorithm .",
    "motivated by this question , we complement the message - passing approach in this paper by implementing and testing a simulated annealing local searching ( sals ) protocol @xcite for the undirected fvs problem . a similar algorithmic study has already been undertaken in @xcite for directed graphs . here",
    "we modify the microscopic search rules of @xcite to make it applicable to undirected graphs . in the sals algorithm ,",
    "an order is defined for the vertices outside the focal fvs , and this order is constrained by a set of local vertex constraints .",
    "our simulation results suggest that this local search algorithm is comparable in performance to the bpd algorithm at least for random graph instances .",
    "the feedback vertex set problem has wide practical applications in the field of computer science ( such as integrated circuit design and database management ) .",
    "although not yet seriously explored , the fvs problem may have many potential applications in complex systems research as well .",
    "for example , if a vertex is contained in a large fraction of the near - optimal feedback vertex sets , we may expect this vertex to play a very significant role for the dynamical processes on the graph .",
    "therefore the probability of belonging to a near - optimal fvs can serve as a centrality index of dynamical significance for each vertex of a graph .",
    "such a probablity can be computed by sampling many independent near - optimal fvs solutions or be computed directly using the belief propagation iterative equations @xcite .",
    "the construction of a near - optimal fvs also facilitates the study of a complex dynamical system as a simpler response problem of a cycle - free subsystem ( which is intrinsically simple ) under the influence of the vertices in the fvs vertices .",
    "if the subgraph induced by the vertices in the fvs itself contains many cycles , such a decomposition can be applied on this subgraph again . through this iterated process , an initial cycle - rich complex graph",
    "is then organized into a hierarchy of forest ( cycle - free ) subgraphs and the edges between these forests . a simple illustration of this hierarchical organization is shown in fig .  [ fig : fvshierarchy ] .",
    "we believe such a hierarchical representation of a complex graph will be very helpful in future dynamical applications .",
    "( color online ) .",
    "the four filled points form an optimal feedback vertex set for this graph @xmath0 .",
    "the subgraph @xmath5 induced by these four vertices and the cycle - free subgraph induced by all the remaining vertices ( shown as open points ) are connected through many edges ( shown in light blue ) .",
    "since the subgraph @xmath5 still contains cycles within itself , we decompose it into a tree subgraph of three vertices ( filled magenta points ) and a subgraph formed by a fvs of one vertex ( the central red point ) . by this way ,",
    "the vertices in the orginal graph @xmath0 are arranged into three different layers .",
    "the vertices of each layer form a cycle - free subgraph ( a tree or a forest ) , while different layers are connected by edges .",
    "an important property of such an organization is that each cycle must involves vertices from at least two layers .",

    "for a graph @xmath0 of @xmath4 vertices , let us consider an ordered list @xmath6 formed by @xmath7 vertices of this graph @xmath8 following @xcite , we assign to the first vertex @xmath9 of this list an integer rank @xmath10 , to the second vertex an integer rank @xmath11 , ... , and to the last vertex @xmath12 an integer rank @xmath13 .",
    "therefore each vertex @xmath14 has an integer rank @xmath15 which marks the position of this vertex in the list @xmath6 . for the purpose of the fvs problem , we introduce for each vertex @xmath14 a ranking condition as @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes an edge of the graph @xmath0 between vertex @xmath18 and vertex @xmath19 , and @xmath20 if @xmath21 and @xmath22 if @xmath23 . the ranking condition ( [ eq : rc ] )",
    "is satisfied by vertex @xmath18 if and only if among all the nearest neighboring vertices of vertex @xmath18 that are also contained in the list @xmath6 , at most one of them has a lower rank than that of @xmath18 .",
    "a list @xmath6 is referred to as a legal list if all its vertices satisfy the ranking condition ( [ eq : rc ] ) .",
    "the link between legal lists and feedback vertex sets is setup by the following two theorems :    [ th:1 ] if @xmath6 is a legal list , then the subgraph of the graph @xmath0 induced by all the vertices of this list is cycle - free .",
    "therefore the set @xmath24 formed by all the remaining vertices of @xmath0 not included in @xmath6 is a fvs .",
    "[ th:2 ] if @xmath24 is a fvs for a graph @xmath0 , then it is possible to form a legal list @xmath6 using all the vertices not contained in @xmath24 .",
    "these two theoretms are easy to prove , see the appendices for technical details .",
    "they suggest that there is a one - to - many correspondance between a fvs @xmath24 and legal lists @xmath6",
    ". therefore the problem of constructing an optimal fvs is converted to a problem of constructing a legal list @xmath6 of maximal cardinality .",
    "notice that judging whether a list @xmath6 is legal or not is algorithmically very easy as eq .",
    "( [ eq : rc ] ) involves only the neighborhood a focal vertex @xmath18 but not the connection pattern of the whole graph @xmath0 .",
    "a similar conversion from global constraints to local constraints has also been used in the steiner tree problem , which aims at constructing a tree of minimal total edge length connecting a set of specified vertices @xcite .    just for simplicity of later discussions ,",
    "let us define the energy of a legal list @xmath6 as the total number of vertices not contained in it , namely @xmath25 in otherwords , @xmath26 is just the cardinality of the complementary fvs @xmath24 of the list @xmath6 .",

    "set the temperature @xmath27 to an initial value @xmath28 .",

    "+ \\(b ) if @xmath6 contains exactly one nearest neighbor ( say @xmath19 with rank @xmath31 ) of the vertex @xmath18 , delete @xmath18 from @xmath24 and insert it to @xmath6 at the position just after vertex @xmath19 .",
    "then vertex @xmath18 has rank @xmath32 in the updated list @xmath6 and the energy of @xmath6 decreases by @xmath30 .",
    "+ \\(c ) if @xmath6 contains two or more nearest neighbors ( say @xmath33 with vertex @xmath19 having the lowest rank @xmath31 among these vertices ) of the vertex @xmath18 , we make a proposal of moving @xmath18 from @xmath24 to the ordered list @xmath6 at the position just after vertex @xmath19 and deleting all those nearest neighbors of @xmath18 from @xmath6 if the insertion of @xmath18 causes the violation of the ranking condition ( [ eq : rc ] ) for these vertices .",
    "suppose @xmath34 vertices have to be deleted from @xmath6 ( and be added to @xmath24 ) as a result of inserting vertex @xmath18 to @xmath6 , then the energy increase of @xmath6 is @xmath35 . if @xmath36 we accept the proposed action with probability @xmath30 , otherwise we accept it with probability @xmath37 .",

    "if the energy value @xmath39 does not change in @xmath42 contiguous temperature stages , then we stop the local search process and output the reached best fvs .    in our computer experiments we use @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 which are identical to the values used in ref .",
    "the temperature ratio @xmath46 is set to several different values @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 . as shown in fig .  2 , the slower the rate of temperature decrease , the lower is the energy of the constructed best fvs solutions .",
    "the bpd algorithm was applied to erds - renyi ( er ) random graphs and regular ( rr ) random graphs in @xcite to test its performance .",
    "as we want to compare the performance of the present sals algorithm with the bpd algorithm , we apply the sals algorithm on the same er and rr random graphs used in @xcite .",
    "an er random graph of @xmath4 vertices and @xmath50 edges was generated in @xcite by first selecting @xmath51 different vertex pairs uniformly at random from the whole set of @xmath52 candidate vertex pairs and then connecting the two vertices of each selected vertex pair by an edge .",
    "a vertex in such a graph has on average @xmath53 nearest neighbors ( i.e. , the mean vertex degree of the graph is @xmath53 ) .",
    "when @xmath54 the vertex degree distribution of the graph converges to a poisson distribution of mean value @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "a rr graph differs from an er graph with the additional constraint that each vertex has exactly the same number @xmath53 of nearest neighbors ( here @xmath53 must be an integer ) .",
    "it was generated by first attaching to each vertex a number of @xmath53 half - edges and then randomly connecting two half - edges into a full edge , but prohibiting self - loops or multiple edges between the same pair of vertices ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details of the graph generation process ) .",
    "the vertex number of all these random graph instances is equal to the same value @xmath55 .",
    "there are @xmath56 independently generated er or rr random graph instances at each fixed ( mean ) degree value @xmath53 .",
    "we run the sals process once on each of these @xmath56 instances and then compare the mean value of the obtained final @xmath39 values with the mean value of the final energies obtained in @xcite by running the bpd process once on each of these @xmath56 graph instances .    the evolution of the minimal energy @xmath39 as a function of the temperature @xmath27 is shown in fig .  [ fig : evolution ] for er ( a ) and rr ( b ) random graphs of @xmath57 .",
    "when @xmath58 the evolution curves for the three different cooling parameters @xmath49 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 coincide with each other .",
    "this indicates that at @xmath58 the typical relaxation time of energy is shorter than the time scale of temperature decreasing . at @xmath61",
    "the curve of @xmath49 starts to separate from the other two curves , and the final value of @xmath39 is considerably higher than those of the other two evolutionary trajectories .",
    "this indicates that at cooling parameter @xmath49 the simulated annealing process is eventually trapped in a local region of the configuration space whose energy minimal value is extensively higher than that of the optimal solutions .",
    "the two evolutionary curves of @xmath62 and @xmath47 again separate from each other at a lower temperature of @xmath63 , and the final value of @xmath39 reached at cooling parameter @xmath47 is slightly lower than the final value of @xmath39 reached at @xmath62 . if the value of @xmath46 is set to be more closer to @xmath30 the final value of @xmath39 will decrease slightly further ( at the expense of much longer simulation times ) .",
    "the observation that lower final energy values can be reached by lowering the cooling rate strongly indicates the system has a very complicated low - energy landscape with many local minima .",
    "this is consistent with the prediction that the undirected fvs problem is in a spin glass phase at low enough energy values @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : fvs ] compares the performance of the sals algorithm ( the cooling parameter fixed to @xmath47 ) with that of the bpd algorithm on er ( a ) and rr ( b ) random graphs . we see that bpd slightly outperforms sals for both ensembles of random graphs",
    "this is not surprising , since the bpd algorithm takes into account the global structure of the graph through message - passing , while the sals algorithm considers only the local graph structure .",
    "it is interesting to see that the results of the two algorithms are actually very close to each other , especially for er random graphs . as also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fvs ] , at each value of ( mean ) degree @xmath53 , the result obtained by the sals algorithm is very close to the predicted value of the global minimal energy by the replica - symmetric mean field theory @xcite .",
    "therefore message - passing algorithms are not the only candidate choices to construct near - optimal feedback vertex sets for undirected random graphs .",
    "an advantage of the sals algorithm is that its implementation is very straightforward .",
    "it may be the method of choice for many practical applications .    , a vertex s probability of being in a feedback vertex set increases with its vertex degree @xmath64 . each star point is the mean result obtained by averaging over the @xmath56 final fvs solutions obtained by the sals algorithm on the @xmath56 random graph instances of @xmath55 vertices .",
    "each plus point denotes the result obtained by the rs mean field theory at @xmath65 @xcite . , scaledwidth=35.0% ]    we also notice from fig .",
    "[ fig : fvs ] that the sals algorithm performs poorer in regular random graphs than in er random graphs .",
    "this is probably due to the following fact : each vertex in a regular random graph has the same degree so there is local guide as to whether a vertex should be included into the feedback vertex set or not .",
    "on the other hand the degree heterogeneity of an er graph will give some local guide to the sals process to arrive at a near - optimal fvs .",
    "based on the final @xmath56 fvs solutions obtained by the sals algorithm on the @xmath56 er random graphs with mean vertex degree @xmath57 , we compute the mean probability @xmath66 that a vertex of degree @xmath64 is contained in the fvs . the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vertexfvsprob ] demonstrate that @xmath66 is close to @xmath67 for @xmath68 and close to @xmath30 for @xmath69 , and it is an rapidly increasing function of @xmath64 in the range of @xmath70 .",
    "the empirically obtained mean value of @xmath66 is found to be very close to the value of @xmath66 computed using the replica - symmetric mean field theory .",
    "notice that for @xmath71 the empirical values of @xmath66 are slightly larger than those predicted by the rs mean field .",
    "such small differences cause the energies of the construsted fvs solutions to be higher than the corresponding optimal values .",
    "the graphs for real - world complex systems usually are highly heterogenous in terms of vertex degree distributions @xcite .",
    "therefore it is very likely that the sals algorithm to have very good performance for such graphs .",
    "in this paper , we implemented and tested a local search algorithm for the undirected feedback vertex set problem . similar to the local search algorithm for the directed fvs problem @xcite",
    ", our algorithm uses the technique of simulated annealing to explore the highly complex landscape of low - energy congiurations .",
    "our simulation results demonstrated that this algorithm is very efficient for large random graph instances .",
    "the relative sizes of the constructed fvs solutions by the local search algorithm are very close to the predicted values of the replica - symmetric mean field theory , and they are also very similar to the results obtained by the bpd message - passing algorithm .    it should be emphasized that the microscopic dynamical rules of our local search algorithm do not obey the detailed balance condition . these dynamical rules therefore need to be appropriately modified if one is interested in the equilibrial fvs solutions at a given fixed temperature @xmath27 .",
    "we are currently using a modified set of microscopic dynamical rules to study the spin glass phase transition of the model proposed in @xcite .",
    "such an equilibrium study will offer more physical insights on the cooling - rate dependent behaviors of fig .",

    "assume there is a cycle in the subgraph @xmath72 involving @xmath64 vertices : @xmath73 if the rank of vertex @xmath74 is lower than that of @xmath75 , then due to the fact of vertex @xmath75 having at most one nearest neighbor with lower rank than itself , the rank of @xmath76 must be higher than that of @xmath75 .",
    "continuing this analysis along the cycle , we obtain that the rank of vertex @xmath77 must be higher than that of @xmath78 but lower than that of @xmath74 .",
