    "type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) have contributed to the chemical evolution of the universe by releasing iron peak and alpha chain elements into the various star forming and other gaseous regions . as sne",
    "ia  are among the brightest objects known and their light curves can be used to improve their uniformity , they are among the most useful objects with which to study the structure and nature of the universe @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to have a fuller understanding of the underlying physics and origin of sne  ia .",
    "the current understanding of the progenitor system for sne  iafeatures a sub - chandrasekhar mass c+o white dwarf accreting mass from an ordinary star until reaching the chandrasekhar mass , or by merging with another c+o white dwarf and then exploding ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "sne  ia  scenarios with sub - chandrasekhar mass explosions have not been able to reproduce the observed spectra and photometry @xcite .",
    "sn 1994d , in ngc 4526 , was discovered 2 weeks before maximum brightness @xcite .",
    "it was one of the best observed sne  ia , with near - daily spectra starting 12 days before maximum brightness ( -12 days ) and continuing throughout the photospheric phase .",
    "sn  1994dhas been well observed photometrically @xcite and spectroscopically @xcite .",
    "@xcite found no significant polarization in sn  1994d  10 days before maximum light .",
    "@xcite placed a limit on a solar - composition progenitor wind of @xmath3  m@xmath4  yr@xmath1 for a 10 km  s@xmath1  wind .",
    "sn  1994d  has been previously modeled with synthetic spectra and light curves by several groups @xcite .",
    "our goal in this paper is to take a large set of observed spectra and a detailed ( even if somewhat parameterized ) hydrodynamical model and confront the two .",
    "@xcite did this to some extent , but focused on the photometry more heavily , partly because much of the spectroscopy has    sne  ia  with spectral coverage this frequent and early are still quite rare .",
    "other sne  ia   with excellent spectral coverage are : sn  1989b @xcite , discovered approximately 7 days before maximum light , sn  1996x @xcite , discovered 6 days before maximum light , and sn  1998bu @xcite , discovered 10 days before maximum light . both of these well observed , normal sne  iawere discovered after the phase in sn  1994d  when daily spectral coverage had already begun .",
    "this aspect of the available data for sn  1994d  make it still the best candidate for detailed , multi - epoch spectrum synthesis of the photospheric phase , especially at the earliest dates .",
    "this detailed and early set of spectra allow us to probe the spectrum formation at early epochs , and therefore the outermost layers of the supernova .",
    "we have used the multi - purpose spectrum synthesis and model atmosphere code phoenix  9.1  ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "phoenix  has been designed to accurately include the various effects of special relativity important in rapidly expanding atmospheres , like supernovae .",
    "ionization by non - thermal electrons from @xmath5-rays from the nuclear decay of @xmath6ni  that powers the light curves of sne  ia  is taken into account .",
    "we have tested , in a few models , an updated method for calculating the @xmath5-ray  deposition using a solution of the spherically symmetric radiative transfer equation for @xmath5-rays with phoenix , and found no difference in deposition or temperature convergence relative to the older , single @xmath7-iteration technique of @xcite which is based on the method of @xcite .",
    "we used an effective @xmath5-ray  opacity , @xmath8  y@xmath9  @xmath10  gm@xmath1 @xcite for all calculations . in the models presented here",
    "we solve the nlte rate equations for  ( 10 levels/37 transitions ) ,  ( 19/37 ) , ( 10/45 ) ,  ( 228/1387 ) ,  ( 36/66 ) ,  ( 26/37 ) ,  ( 3/2 ) ,  ( 73/340 ) ,  ( 93/436 ) ,  ( 84/444 ) ,  ( 204/2399 ) ,  ( 617/13675 ) , and  ( 255/2725 ) , which we have chosen both for computational efficiency and to be consistent with what was used in our earlier work @xcite . in future work",
    "we will use more species in nlte , but test calculations show that this is the primary feature forming species of each element and that it set is quite adequate .    the model w7 was prepared by homologous expansion using a rise time of 20 days after explosion to maximum light ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the hydrodynamic output was extended from @xmath11  km  s@xmath1  to 30000  km  s@xmath1  with the unburned c+o white dwarf composition as in previous phoenix  calculations using w7 @xcite . at each epoch",
    ", we have fit the luminosity to match the shape and color of the observations , while solving for the energy balance and converged nlte rate equations . to fit the spectra , after having fixed the date of explosion ( 20 days before maximum brightness in b ) , the model ( w7 ) , and the nlte species , the only parameter we allow to vary is the bolometric luminosity of the model .",
    "the bolometric luminosity for a model with a fixed density structure is a required boundary condition for the system of equations , but it may also be convienently thought of in terms of a `` model temperature '' so that one can see that varying the model temperature is the degree of freedom necessary to match of the shape of the synthetic spectrum to the observations .",
    "we have found that with luminosity changes of less than 20% it is difficult to discern differences in the quality of the fit , except in certain cases with good observed spectral coverage and good synthetic spectral fits .",
    "this corresponds to about 5% differences in temperature and about 0.2 magnitudes in the absolute luminosity calibration .",
    "our selection of the best fit is done by eye and at least two of the authors independently select the best fit .",
    "while a lot of experience is involved in selecting the best fit , we first strive to fit the overall shape ( or colors ) and then we strive to fit the lineshape of selected lines .",
    "we are developing statistical tests to improve the sensitivity and we note that we are sensitive to much smaller variations of order 0.02 mag when this method is applied to sne  ii ( r.  mitchell et al . , e.  baron et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "we have calculated synthetic spectra from -12 days after maximum light ( day 8 after explosion ) to 12 days after maximum light ( day 32 after explosion ) .",
    "the plotted synthetic spectra have been multiplied by an arbitrary constant to give the best fit to the de - redshifted and de - reddened observation .",
    "we have adopted the reddening , @xmath12 , of @xcite .",
    "the quoted error , @xmath13 , is consistent with the other estimates of @xmath14 ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "using @xmath15 , we have applied the @xcite reddening law to deredden the observations for comparison with the synthetic spectra .",
    "we have de - redshifted the observed spectra by @xmath16  km  s@xmath1  @xcite for the heliocentric velocity of the supernova , which is at the 0.3  % level .",
    "synthetic optical and infra - red photometry are listed in table  [ tab : phot ] . observed colors and reddened synthetic colors are listed in table  [ tab : color ]  for comparison .",
    "we plot the 9  march 1994 observed spectrum of sn  1994d  with our best synthetic spectrum at day  8 after the explosion in figure  [ fig : d08 ] .",
    "the features of the synthetic spectrum match the observations in strength and shape , except the large  h+kabsorption at 3800   .",
    "this feature is not well produced in the earliest synthetic spectra due to over - ionization , which we discuss in   [ cana ] .",
    "the 6000    absorption is shifted upward somewhat by a small difference in the ` continuum ' between the model and sn  1994d , but the strength and shape are otherwise fine .",
    "of special note is the broad  feature at 45005000   .",
    "@xcite attribute this feature to high - velocity iron in the unburned , or at least unenhanced by fresh iron , layers of the supernova . we concur with this conclusion , and note that if any minima exist in the  opacity , as they needed to fit the shape the feature , the minima arise naturally from the radiative equilibrium and nlte treatment within the w7 model .",
    "the red minimum in the absorption is weaker in our fit than in the observation , but the two minima are clearly indicated .",
    "this feature is robust . in a model with one - half the luminosity ,",
    "the  feature remains strong and continues to form in high - velocity material , though the total flux blueward of that feature ( synthetic spectrum not plotted ) is greatly reduced relative to the red flux .",
    "we have also tested the  hypothesis . in a spectrum containing only  line opacity",
    "the feature appeared with the same shape and strength .",
    "this technique is discussed in   [ ir105 ] .",
    "the overall shape of the synthetic spectrum fits the peaks in the spectrum as well as the ` continuum ' flux level blue of the  h+k feature and red of the  feature .",
    "the @xmath17and @xmath18  colors are within 0.1  mag of the observed values , which is less than the estimated errors , and therefore in agreement . the weakness of the  h+k  feature in the synthetic spectrum decreases ( brightens ) @xmath19 by about 0.2  magnitudes .",
    "we plot the 10  march 1994 observed spectrum of sn  1994d  with our best synthetic spectrum at day  9 in figure  [ fig : d09 ] .",
    "the ` continuum ' levels and spectral features of the synthetic again match the observation except for the  h+k  absorption .",
    "the features are similar to the 9  march spectrum and the day  8 synthetic spectrum , including the deep , fast  feature .",
    "the colors are consistent with observations except @xmath20 , which is too small , clearly caused by the weak  h+k  feature in the synthetic spectrum .",
    "we plot the 11  march 1994 observed spectrum of sn  1994d  with our best synthetic spectrum at day  10 in figure  [ fig : d10 ] .",
    "note that the observations obtained by patat are in cgs , whereas those obtained at lick are in arbitrary units .",
    "both scales are linear , so the reader should be able to judge the fit quality equally well when comparing between spectra obtained by different observers .",
    "again the model and observation are quite similar to the previous two dates . however , the  feature is changing in shape and is no longer as strong .",
    "this is reflected in the synthetic spectrum .",
    "the synthetic spectrum again falls short of the peak of the observed flux near 4000   , but this would be compensated if the  h+k  feature were stronger .",
    "this model has been chosen for the fit to the strength and shape of the  features and our estimate of the flux from the previous observations blueward of the  h+k  feature .",
    "the synthetic and observed optical colors are consistent .",
    "a good fraction of the 0.4  mag difference in the @xmath20  colors is related to the weak  h+kfeature .",
    "the 12  march 1994 observed spectrum of sn  1994d  and our best synthetic spectrum at day  11 are displayed in figure  [ fig : d11 ] .",
    "most of the features in the synthetic spectrum fit quite well at this epoch .",
    "the  h+k  feature is still weaker than the observed , but the relative strength has improved over the previous day .",
    "this is reflected in the better match of the @xmath20  synthetic color to the two observations .",
    "the fact that the model is bluer than the observations to the red of 6000    is likely due to the fact that there is not enough line blanketing produced by w7 , ( which would push flux from the blue to the red ) .",
    "we shall see that this is likely due to a flaw in the density and/or composition structure of the inner parts of w7 .",
    "the remaining colors are consistent with observations .",
    "figure  [ fig : d12 ] shows the 13  march 1994 observed spectrum of sn  1994d  with our best synthetic spectrum at day  12 .",
    "the synthetic spectrum fits the observation very well , with nearly all features represented , although some strengths are incorrect .",
    "the  h+kfeature is still weaker than the observation , but it now shows the ` split ' which we have previously shown to be generated by a blend of  h+k  and  @xmath21 @xcite . the blue  feature at 5800    is stronger than in the observation .",
    "@xcite  have shown that the relative strength of the two features are an effective temperature diagnostic .",
    "the stronger blue  feature in the model indicates that the line - forming region is cooler in the model than in sn  1994d .",
    "we can improve the ratio of the two  features by increasing the luminosity and therefore the temperature of the model , but this would change the overall shape of the spectrum . the flux levels in the red , and blue of the  h+k  feature , would not both match the observation .",
    "the part of the spectrum just blueward of  h+k  is a very sensitive temperature / luminosity diagnostic .",
    "the photometric colors of the synthetic spectrum and observations are consistent .",
    "the sn  1994d  observed spectrum of day  14 ( 15  march 1994 ) with our best synthetic spectrum is shown in figure  [ fig : d14 ] .",
    "the fit to the shape and features is good .",
    "the colors are in agreement , except @xmath22 , which is bluer than the observations .",
    "this is the result of a modest red deficit redward of the  features . in order to estimate the accuracy of our parameter determination ,",
    "we display the best fit model and observation with the models with luminosities @xmath23  from the best fit in figure  [ fig : d14comp ] . the differences are largest around the  h+k  feature .",
    "this shows how accurately the fits can be made if spectra are available extending blueward of the  h+k  feature and the input model provides a well fit spectrum .",
    "we plot the 16  march 1994 observed spectrum of sn  1994d  with our best synthetic spectrum at day  15 in figure  [ fig : d15 ] . the fit has a good shape and many of the features fit",
    "the  h+k  feature does not absorb blueward enough , and the feature just blueward absorbs much too strongly .",
    "the synthetic colors are good , especially the @xmath20  which agrees very well with @xcite .",
    "the @xmath22  color is significantly bluer than the observations , possibly due to the steeper slope at the red edge of the  feature .",
    "the 17  march 1994 observed spectrum of sn  1994d  with our best synthetic spectrum at day  16 are shown in figure  [ fig : d16 ] .",
    "the synthetic spectrum fits the observation very well .",
    "the shapes of the features match very well . of note",
    "is the fit in the  h+k  and blueward , and the fit of the  feature at 6150   including the slope and ` bend ' in the continuum redward of the feature .",
    "there is only the small downward continuum shift between these two well fit regions .",
    "this shift is reflected in the @xmath18  color which is 0.10 to 0.15 magnitudes redder depending on the comparison observations .",
    "the rest of the colors coincide with the observations . for this model the total continuum optical depth at 5000   , @xmath24 ,",
    "is unity at 9000  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "this is the transition point between the partially burned material and the @xmath6ni - rich core .",
    "we plot the 18  march 1994 observed spectrum of sn  1994d  with our best synthetic spectrum at day  17 in figure  [ fig : d17 ] . like day  16",
    ", the day  17 spectrum fits the  h+k  feature very well .",
    "the remaining feature shapes are also good , but the slightly lower continuum level between the  h+k  and  features remains .",
    "again , this makes the @xmath18  color redder than the observations .",
    "figure  [ fig : d18 ] displays the 19  march 1994 observed spectrum of sn  1994d  with our best synthetic spectrum at day  18 .",
    "the shape of the fit is good , especially blueward of 4000    and redward of 6000   .",
    "the shape of the features between the  h+k  and 6150    features is good , but they are shifted to lower flux .",
    "this lower flux makes the @xmath18  color redder than the observations .",
    "plotted in figure  [ fig : d19 ] is the 20  march 1994 observed spectrum of sn  1994d  with our best synthetic spectrum at day  19 .",
    "the shape of the synthetic spectrum is good .",
    "the fit is good blueward of 4000  and redward of 6000   .",
    "the shapes of many of the features between are poor . the overly strong blue  feature at 5750",
    "  indicates that the temperature of the line - forming region is too low . by increasing the luminosity by 40%",
    ", the resulting temperature change improves the fit of the blue  feature and the   w \"  feature at 5000 - 5500   .",
    "this badly changes the shape of the blue part of the synthetic spectrum .",
    "these features form in the optically thin zone at this and later epochs . if we could heat this zone without affecting the luminosity the quality of the spectrum could be improved . a viable way to achieve",
    "this would be to mix additional @xmath6ni  into the zone , which is expected in multi - dimensional burning models .",
    "the colors are all redder than the observations , particularly @xmath17  and @xmath22 , thus suggesting that the luminosity or model temperature is too low .",
    "we plot the 23  march 1994 observed spectrum of sn  1994d  with our best synthetic spectrum at day  22 in figure  [ fig : d22 ] .",
    "the shape of this spectrum is good , but the strength of some of the optical features is exaggerated .",
    "the   w \"  is far too weak in our synthetic spectrum .",
    "the observation shows a sharp edged feature which indicates that the opacity strongly cuts off at higher velocities .",
    "this is consistent with the sulfur distribution in w7 . in the region of strong sulfur concentration",
    ", the sulfur in the w7 model has an ionization ratio s@xmath25s@xmath26 .",
    "this , along with the temperature sensitive strength of the red  feature at 5800   , suggests that the ionization temperature should be higher in the zone between the fe - core and the unburned region in these epochs where they are optically thin .",
    "the colors are consistent with the trends in the observations , except the @xmath18 , which is affected by the larger fluxes at the   w \"  feature .",
    "we plot the 26  march 1994 observed spectrum of sn  1994d  with our best synthetic spectrum at day  25 in figure  [ fig : d25 ] . as in day  22 , the   w \"  is weak and the red  feature is too strong .",
    "the overall shape of the spectrum appears to be good , but the limited range of the spectral data make a more certain fitting of the blue peaks near  h+k , and therefore the total luminosity , difficult . this is reflected in the colors , which are erratic , and do not follow any general trend .",
    "of particular note is the shift in the synthetic @xmath20color to redder than the observations , indicating a near-@xmath27 deficit in the synthetic spectra .      plotted in figure  [ fig : d27 ]",
    "is the 29  march 1994 observed spectrum of sn  1994d  with our best synthetic spectrum at day  27 . as on day  25",
    "the limited range of the available observed spectrum makes precise fitting of the luminosity difficult .",
    "the general difficulties in making the rest of the spectrum fit may be due to problems with the w7 model or with the temperature structure we have calculated in our quasi - static , energy balanced models .",
    "the spectrum is also making the nebular transition , the continuum optical depth at 5000   , @xmath28 . like day  25 , the colors disagree with the observed photometry .",
    "we plot the 31  march 1994 observed spectrum of sn  1994d  with our best synthetic spectrum at day  30 in figure  [ fig : d30 ] .",
    "the minimum wavelength of the 31  march spectrum is only 5500   , so we have scaled the 2  april spectrum and added it to figure  [ fig : d30 ] .",
    "we have now switched to nebular boundary conditions because @xmath29 [ see @xcite and @xcite for a discussion of our choice of boundary conditions and the results of tests ] .",
    "this means that we assume that the space inside the innermost zone , at @xmath30  km  s@xmath1 , is completely transparent .",
    "the shape of the spectrum is good and the line features are acceptable .",
    "the largest discrepancy is the complete lack of the  d  feature .",
    "this feature has been slowly growing in the observations , but is not replicated in the synthetic spectra .",
    "we discuss this in   [ cana ] .",
    "the colors are still erratic , but the @xmath20  is not as excessively red as before .",
    "figure  [ fig : d32 ] shows the 2  april 1994 observed spectrum of sn  1994d  with our best synthetic spectrum at day  32 .",
    "this spectrum fits a bit less well than for day  30 .",
    "again the strong  d  feature is missing . like",
    "the day  30 model , the day  32 model uses nebular boundary conditions and the luminosity corresponds to instantaneous re - processing of deposited @xmath5-ray  energy .",
    "the continuum optical depth continues to decline and for this model is @xmath31 .",
    "the colors continue to be erratic , and the deficit in the near-@xmath27 is reflected by the very red @xmath20 .",
    "we have extended the luminosities found by fitting the earliest spectra using a parabolic luminosity law , @xmath32 , as used by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this form approximates the early sn  ia  as a fixed temperature object with a constant _ velocity _ photosphere .",
    "we plot our synthetic spectra using our extended luminosities in figure  [ fig : early ] . to avoid computational problems caused by the sharp density ` spikes ' at the edge of the unburned c+o which are close to the photosphere for the day  1 and day  2 models ,",
    "we have used an exponential density law , @xmath33 , where @xmath34  km  s@xmath1  to match the shape of the w7 density profile .",
    "the three exponential models ( dashed lines ) extend to @xmath35  km  s@xmath1  and show a much larger @xmath27-deficit at the  h+k  edge .",
    "we have computed another model at day  3 where the outer edge of the ejecta was at @xmath36  km  s@xmath1 , as it is in w7 , demonstrating that the strength of the large @xmath27 deficit is related to the extension of the atmosphere .",
    "this will be an interesting topic for future modeling of early sne  ia  @xmath27 spectra and photometry .",
    "the other significant difference between the exponential and regular w7 models is the  ir triplet  feature at 8000   .",
    "the features in the synthetic spectra evolve during the week after explosion .",
    "the  feature becomes weaker for earlier spectra .",
    "this behavior is the same as found in @xcite , where some features , including , were formed mostly in the intermediate velocity regions containing freshly formed silicon . at early times ,",
    "the outer layers are more opaque to the deeper , silicon - rich material and the  feature forms in the unenriched c+o layers .",
    "additionally at earlier times , the mass of silicon outside the `` photosphere '' , loosely defined as @xmath37 , is less than later times .",
    "this decrease in absorption is also likely the reason for the decreasing strength of the  feature at 7500   .",
    "the feature at 4800    is formed in the fast c+o layer as we have discussed in   [ mar9 ] .",
    "the  ir triplet  is likely saturated and only changes with the switch to an exponential density profile .",
    "we have computed synthetic @xmath38 @xcite using the prescription of @xcite , and @xmath39 ( m.  hamuy , private communication ) photometry from the synthetic spectra presented in   [ spec ] .",
    "the synthetic photometry are plotted in figures  [ fig : photuv ] , [ fig : photopt ] , &  [ fig : photir ] , and the colors in figures  [ fig : coloruv ] , [ fig : coloropt ] , &  [ fig : colorir ] .",
    "we have calculated the photometry for our synthetic spectra in the @xmath27 using the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) , scheduled to be installed in the hubble space telescope in 2001 .",
    "we used the acs exposure time calculatorto obtain count rates in each filter and calibrated the results with a vega calibration spectrum at @xmath40 .",
    "the acs absolute photometry and the count rates for our spectra when observed at @xmath41  cm , @xmath42 , are reported in table  [ tab : uv ] .",
    "we can see that with this instrument , accurate @xmath27 photometry of sne  ia  which are a few days old are possible with short exposures .",
    "the @xmath27 light curves in figure  [ fig : photuv ] peak 36  days before maximum light in the visual band .",
    "this is approximately consistent with the @xmath43-band peak displacements of -1  day @xcite and -2  days @xcite in the sn  1994d  observations and -1  day in the light curve analysis of @xcite .",
    "the peak timing of the @xmath27 light curves is also consistent with the report of @xcite .",
    "the colors ( figure  [ fig : coloruv ] ) between the three acs filters are fairly flat with no consistent trend , but with some oscillations as the @xmath27 region is the most sensitive to small fitting errors in modeling the synthetic spectra .",
    "the f330w-@xmath43 color is the difference between the ` acs  @xmath43 ' and the @xcite  @xmath43 .",
    "though the filters are intended to be equivalent , the large , strong , features of sne  ia  make simple transformations difficult .",
    "these difficulties can be overcome by applying the relevant transformations for the object s reddening and red - shift , and for the observational filter and detector , to the synthetic spectra when generating synthetic photometry for comparison with observations and illustrate the need for synthetic spectra when comparing photometric observations .",
    "figure  [ fig : photopt ] shows that the @xmath43-band , like the f330w band , peaks about 36  days before maximum light consistent with the observations .",
    "the @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 light curves do not fall as fast after maximum as the observations @xcite .",
    "this is likely due to the large features of the post - maximum spectra that did not fit as well as the pre - maximum spectra .",
    "the colors are plotted in figure  [ fig : coloropt ] .",
    "the @xmath20  curve corresponds well with the observations @xcite , getting bluer until @xmath48 at about -5  days , then becoming redder until @xmath49 .",
    "the final few models become too @xmath20  red , but this is clearly seen in the @xmath27-deficits in the related synthetic spectra .",
    "the @xmath17  curves show the same shallow blue minimum near maximum light and slow reddening afterward as in the observations @xcite .",
    "the @xmath18  curves follow the same blue evolution from @xmath50 at -10  days to @xmath51 at + 10  days as observed @xcite .",
    "the @xmath22  color falls from @xmath52 at -10  days to @xmath53 and then returns to @xmath52 afterwards as do the observations @xcite , but the timing of the synthetic colors is ambiguous and possibly earlier than the observations .",
    "we have plotted the synthetic infra - red light curves in figure  [ fig : photir ] .",
    "the @xmath54-band photometry seems to be consistent with the light curve templates of @xcite .",
    "the @xmath55-band is flat rather than falling during the post - maximum period we model , and the @xmath56-band rises rather than remaining flat .",
    "this is likely due to the difficulties noted in   [ postmax ] with features",
    "not fitting well .",
    "the pre - maximum @xmath57 photometry is flat within fitting scatter for all bands in the 10 days before maximum consistent with the @xmath57 photometry of sn  1998bu @xcite .",
    "the @xmath57 colors are presented in figure  [ fig : colorir ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : bolo ] displays the bolometric luminosity which is clearly too flat after maximum @xcite .",
    "we suspect that both the peak is a little too subluminous and that if the postmaximum fits better reproduced the observed colors , we would have better agreement with observed bolometric light curves after maximum .",
    "this shows that while the density structure and composition of the outer layers of w7 do a good job of reproducing the observed spectra , the structure of the inner layers is not quite correct .",
    "the identification of the absorption feature at 10500    in the spectra of sne  ia  has been the subject of debate .",
    "the primary candidates are :  @xmath5810830 ,  @xmath5811287 ,  @xmath5810926 , and  @xmath5810926 .",
    "all of these , except , are found in w7 .",
    "we have treated all of these species in nlte . @xcite and @xcite find both  and  as equally probable .",
    "@xcite found the feature best fit with .",
    "@xcite  and @xcite  have used delayed detonation models of c+o white dwarfs and found that the  provided a good fit and could be used as a diagnostic of the outer edge of the burned material in sn  ia .",
    "we have also used a model , w7 , that does not contain helium and found that the feature fit well .",
    "we have plotted the near-@xmath57 spectrum of sn  1994d  on 20  march with our best fit model and a diagnostic spectrum in figure  [ fig : day19ir ] .",
    "the diagnostic spectrum is generated from the converged atmosphere model and calculated with only  line opacity and no other line opacity .",
    "we can see that the 10500  feature in all three spectra are of the same strength and at the same wavelength .",
    "this feature , which does not shift in wavelength in the observations at earlier epochs @xcite , is clearly formed by  in our synthetic spectra of w7 .",
    "this also shows that the abundance of magnesium and the velocity range in w7 corresponds well to that in sn  1994d .",
    "we have applied our synthetic photometry of sn  1994d  and the many available observed photometric data to derive the distance to ngc  4526 using the spectral - fitting expanding atmospheres method ( seam ) .",
    "seam determines the distance to a supernova by fitting the spectra of a supernova and deriving a distance modulus , @xmath59 , from the synthetic photometry @xcite .",
    "we have used all @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 photometry from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite that correspond to the dates of the spectra we have fit in   [ spec ] .",
    "we plot the individual distance moduli obtained from each observation paired with the appropriate synthetic spectrum in figure  [ fig : mu ] .",
    "the error bars include the stated observational error and our estimate of the fitting error of the model luminosity . for the @xmath43-band data of @xcite we have used an error of 0.5 magnitudes to reflect the systematic error suspected by the observers .",
    "we have computed an error - weighted mean of the distance modulus and have found the value , @xmath60 , where 0.3 is the 1-@xmath61 error .",
    "the individual band averages range from @xmath62 for the @xmath47-band to @xmath63 for the @xmath43-band .",
    "the horizontal line in figure  [ fig : mu ] is a weighted least - squares fit to the distance modulus as a function of epoch .",
    "the fit varies by @xmath64 magnitudes over the range of epochs considered ( the slope of the fitted line is 0 to 2 parts in @xmath65 ) .",
    "the luminosity of the model atmosphere depends on the radius which is a function of time .",
    "small changes in the timing of the explosion will affect the derived distance . the spectra change slowly enough that a fit can be nearly replicated with a model expanded to an earlier ( later ) epoch with a lower ( higher ) luminosity .",
    "each day error in the risetime generates an error of @xmath66 magnitudes .",
    "there are also errors that may arise from deficiencies in the chosen model and the other inputs to the synthetic spectra .",
    "we derive the distance modulus to be @xmath67  ( internal )  @xmath68  ( timing ) .",
    "this result is consistent within errors with that of @xcite who find @xmath69 using the globular cluster luminosity function , and with that of @xcite who used light curve calculations to obtain @xmath70 .",
    "two concerns about the synthetic spectra are the general weakness of the  h+k  feature in the models for the first 12 days after the explosion , and the complete absence of the  d  feature , which begins to appear about one week after maximum light .",
    "to overcome these deficiencies we have attempted many modifications to the models . for the early  h+k  problem we have tried extending the models to higher velocities .",
    "this does increase the strength of the  ir triplet  and  h+kfeatures for the very early exponential models in figure  [ fig : early ] , but does not affect the models which correspond to the observed spectra , because at those later epochs the line forming region has moved into the velocities of our normal w7 model . increasing",
    "the density of the c+o region by decreasing the slope of the density decline did not have a significant effect .",
    "we also tried increasing the deposition of @xmath5-ray  energy , but as the problem is over - ionization rather than under ionization , this did not improve the  h+k  feature shape .",
    "we have also tried extreme abundance enrichment in calcium and sodium to make the corresponding features stronger with inadequate results .",
    "thus , overall it will require modifications to w7 to improve the lineshapes of the  h+kand  d  features .",
    "since the problem is that e.g. , ca exists primarily as and we need to increase the population , this would require higher densities , since lower temperatures would no longer fit the overall shape of the observed spectrum .",
    "this could be an indication that non - spherical effects , such as composition asymmetries and clumping are playing a role .",
    "the synthetic spectra made with w7 fit the observed spectra of sn  1994d   quite well in the pre - maximum epoch , except for the above discussed problem with  h+k .",
    "after the continuum ` photosphere ' , @xmath37 , recedes into the fe - peak element rich core the quality of the spectral fits begins to break down .",
    "the other significant possibility is that the particular density and abundance structure of w7 in the fe - rich core is not fully reflective of sne  ia  and sn  1994d .",
    "some neutron rich isotopes have been shown to be overproduced in w7 @xcite .",
    "the other deficiency is in the later pre - maximum spectra where the 40006000    flux is slightly low and certain temperature sensitive features , such as , indicate that the line forming region should be hotter .",
    "we found that these problems could be at least partially solved by increasing the luminosity , which seems to be required by the synthetic photometry .",
    "however , these higher luminosity models fit the blue flux poorly . a model with more @xmath6ni  mixed into the partially burned silicon and sulfur rich zones would raise the effective temperature of the region that is above @xmath71 , which could help both the feature shape and the overall agreement with the inferred maximum brightness of sne  ia .",
    "this type of mixing would be expected in the turbulent 3-d models @xcite .",
    "the sn  ia  c+o white dwarf deflagration model works reasonably well in fitting the normal sne  ia  sn  1994d .",
    "the fits are particularly good for the week before maximum light .",
    "there are some modest problems with the post - maximum spectra that are either due to differences between the w7 fe - rich core composition and structure and that of sne  ia , specifically sn  1994d , or due to significant departures from lte in the temperature , ionization , and level populations of the fe - peak species in the core which requires a more detailed nlte treatment . from these results",
    "it seems reasonable to infer that the outer parts of w7 reasonably well resemble the outer parts of sne  ia , whereas the inner parts differ in density , composition , or nickel mixing / clumping . from the synthetic spectra we have computed synthetic photometry",
    "this synthetic photometry combined with the synthetic specrta allow us to use the seam method to calculate the distance to ngc  4526 , which we find to be @xmath2 .",
    "this is a very encouraging demonstration of the potential of the seam method applied to sne  ia .",
    "observationally , the fitting described in this paper requires spectra that show a rise from the blue , through the peak of the distribution , to the red tail .",
    "practically , this means spectra covering the range 31008000   , preferably extending to 10000  or beyond .",
    "near-@xmath27 spectra and photometry are also needed for at least some objects , so that we might understand what variability exists in the near-@xmath27 .",
    "we hope that to have demonstrated that this data is accessible with the current generation of instruments for sne  ia  out to @xmath72 .",
    "early discovery and monitoring are also important since we can probe the outermost layers of sne  ia  only at these early times and hopefully better constrain the risetimes of sne  ia  as a group and individually .",
    "we plan to consider additional explosion models , peculiar sne  ia , and infra - red spectra in more detail .",
    "part of our efforts will be to test the effects of more complete nlte treatment of all relevant ionic species in the opacity .",
    "we are also working to include non - equilibrium temperature evolution effects through the calculation of light curves .",
    "we thank mario hamuy for providing us with the infrared filter and atmospheric transmission functions and for helpful discussions on their proper interpretation and use .",
    "we also thank alex filippenko , ferdinando patat , nic walton , jim lewis , and peter meikle for providing us with their observed spectra and photometry .",
