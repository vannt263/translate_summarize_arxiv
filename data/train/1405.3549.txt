    "superconducting magnetic energy storage ( smes ) has been traditionally considered for power conditioning applications , where instantaneous high power can be delivered in a matter of milliseconds . among the advantages exclusively offered by superconductors we could mention : _ i _ ) higher energy storage efficiency ( @xmath195@xmath2 ) than other existing energy storage systems @xcite , and _ ii _ ) almost - immediate charge / discharge characteristics @xcite .",
    "certain applications , such as the electrical power grid and electromagnetic rail launchers are heavily - dependent on the efficiency and rapid charge / discharge response of a smes @xcite . currently , it is one of a few superconductivity - based applications that is adaptable to the needs of the electric utilities markets @xcite .",
    "recently , a renewed interest in smes technologies has been motivated by the search for means of improving the stability of the future power grid system , that would incorporate a large number of intermittent energy sources , such as wind and solar @xcite .",
    "historically , the concept of the smes to a power system was originally developed in 1969 in order to balance the variations in the supply and demand of electricity @xcite .",
    "low - temperature superconductors , such as nb - ti , have been successfully used for smes , however , issues with reliability of 4.2 k cryogenics , efficiency of power electronics , and the relatively low energy density of nb - based smes have limited the applicability of the technology to a few cases , where electric power quality is at premium @xcite .",
    "since the magnetic energy stored in a smes is proportional to @xmath3 , doubling the operating field can quadruple the stored energy , an advantage , unmatched by other energy storage solutions .",
    "in contrast to the superconducting transition temperature , @xmath4 , and the upper critical field , @xmath5 , the current - carrying capability , measured by the critical current density , @xmath6 , is governed by the vortex pinning strength , which depends fundamentally on the intrinsic properties of the superconducting state , and is determined by the ability of defects in superconductors to pin the vortices carrying magnetic flux .",
    "so far , second generation ( 2 g ) high temperature superconductor ( hts ) yba@xmath0cu@xmath7o@xmath8 ( ybco ) has offered the greatest hope for implementation , since it exhibits all - around superior properties to all other classes of superconductors @xcite , especially in light of the fact that it offers a possibility of operation at a temperature much higher than that of liquid helium @xcite .",
    "however , other promising candidates have emerged throughout the years as well , such as magnesium diboride , mgb@xmath0 @xcite and the recently - discovered iron - based superconductors @xcite .",
    "even though mgb@xmath0 and the fe - based superconductors have typically lower @xmath4 s , @xmath5 s and @xmath6 s compared to the hts s , they exhibit much lower magnetic field anisotropies and are capable of being processed by a variety of methods @xcite .",
    "magnet design has become a process of paramount importance to smes performance , necessitating better and faster analytical tools , since magnetic field calculations in and around a smes demand sizeable cpu time and memory .",
    "the finite element method ( fem ) has been the most common tool currently utilized for computations of magnetic fields in superconducting magnetic energy storage devices .    in this report",
    ", we present an alternative approach towards building an algorithmic solution for simulating and optimizing a smes device based on a selection of superconducting materials , such as second - generation ybco tape or mgb@xmath0 . this method is based on the _ radia _ software package , which is written in object - oriented c++ , and interfaced to mathematica via mathlink .",
    "a substantial portion of algorithmic processing in the scope of this work is implemented in the mathematica language . here , _ radia _",
    "is used to assess the fields created by 3d volumes with constant current density , based on the biot - savart law .",
    "additionally , we present results on realistic ac loss assessment in a smes , and suggest that for energies in the @xmath9  @xmath10 joule range ac losses are tolerable and will not significantly impact smes performance .",
    "in this section we present the analytical considerations behind our smes design / optimization algorithm .",
    "first , we begin by presenting an overview of the geometrical considerations for a realistic smes .",
    "then , we describe _ radia _  an analytical tool used here as an alternative to finite element methods ( fem ) calculations . in the subsequent subsection",
    "we outline the computational considerations , and compare our initial outputs with those of a fem . in the final subsection , we revisit the topic of magnetic field scanning inside a coil as a necessary ingredient for a smes optimization algorithm .      generally , there exist several types of geometrical arrangements for building a smes @xcite , but the toroidal design , offers the advantage of a reduced stray ( perpendicular ) magnetic field on the tape or wire , mostly confining the field inside the coil . such an arrangement is especially critical for second generation ( 2 g ) ybco tape , since ybco is marked by a high critical current density anisotropy , @xmath11 . in the case of ybco , the in - plane @xmath12 t ) = 10.8 ma/@xmath13 , for example , can exceed the out of plane one @xmath14 t ) = 1.8 ma/@xmath13 by roughly an order of magnitude at 4.2 k.      the smes simulation reported here has been built on top of the _ radia _ software package using _ mathematica _ by wolfram research .",
    "the _ radia _ software package was designed by scientists at the european synchrotron radiation facility ( esrf ) , for solving physical and technical problems one encounters during the development of insertion devices for synchrotron light sources .",
    "however , it can also be used in different branches of physics , where efficient solutions of 3d boundary problems of magnetostatics are needed .",
    "the _ radia _ package is essentially a 3d magnetostatics computer code optimized for undulators and wigglers .",
    "the code has been extensively benchmarked with respect to a commercial finite element code @xcite .",
    "all esrf insertion devices built since 1992 have been designed using this code or its earlier versions .",
    "a large number of predictions made by _",
    "radia _ concerning the magnetic field and field integrals were verified on real insertion devices after manufacture .",
    "thus , one can design nearly any permanent magnet undulator or wiggler , including the central field as well as the extremities @xcite .    creating and linking the objects",
    "properly is the first step in describing the magnetostatics problem .",
    "contrary to the fem approach , _ radia _ does not mesh the vacuum ( an example of a fem geometrical segmentation and field generation is shown in fig .",
    "1 ) @xcite , but rather , solves boundary magnetostatic problems with magnetized and current - carrying volumes , using the boundary integral approach .",
    "the current - carrying elements can be straight or curved blocks @xcite , and the planar boundary conditions are simulated via sets of space transformations , such as translations , rotations , or plane symmetry inversions @xcite . applying transformations with a multiplicity can be understood as an efficient use of the symmetries in the model being solved .",
    "this results in a minimum number of degrees of freedom , and therefore , dramatically reduces the memory requirements and cpu time needed to obtain a solution @xcite .",
    "the reduction of the necessary elements for precisions comparable to fem approaches ( see fig .",
    "2 ) @xcite leads to a drastic reduction of the required cpu time ( typically on the order of 20 times smaller ) .",
    "this time efficiency is crucial when it comes to creating smes optimization algorithms , where , as we will show in the discussion section , for each point in configuration space one needs to carry the entire operation multiple times , from creating the entire smes toroid with its associated coils , to computing the field distributions and stored energies , and calculating optimum design parameters .    in the current work",
    ", we employed _ radia _ to simulate and optimize a realistic smes device , which takes into account the temperature and magnetic field dependent critical current density , @xmath15 , of the superconducting wire of choice used in the simulation ( second generation ybco tape or mgb@xmath0 ) .",
    "the significant reduction in computation time was the primary motivation behind this endeavor .",
    "our algorithm starts by specifying the actual geometry of the device , which is built according to given specifications , such as _ i _ ) coil radius , _ ii _ ) coil thickness , _ iii _ ) coil width , _ iv _ ) coil thickness , _ v _ ) toroidal radius , and _ vi _ ) number of coils .",
    "the coil radius is defined as the mean of the inner and outer radii ( with respect to the coil s axis of symmetry ) of each coil , while the coil thickness is the difference between these two ( see the 16 module toroidal system generated by _",
    "radia _ in fig .",
    "the large ( toroidal ) radius is the distance from the geometric center of the smes to the geometric center of each individual coil , and the typical toroidal radia that we employed were on the order of 1  2 meters .",
    "a realistic toroidal - type smes design must include the frame and conduction support bars , as well as insulating spacers between the coils .    _ radia _ gives the freedom of choosing the degree of segmentation of each coil ; the more segments are chosen , the closer the geometry is to an ideal cylindrical shape , but it will also result in longer computation time .",
    "we `` built '' coils with 50 segments for the actual simulations .",
    "a significant increase in the segmentation tends to lead to an undue increase in the computation time without the benefit of a significant increase in the precision .    in order to test the validity of _ radia_-based simulations , we compared the outputs of our _ radia_-generated smes design with that of a fem simulation by lee _ et al .",
    "we computed the maximum magnetic fields parallel and perpendicular to the test coil , as well as the total energy stored in the device using the same geometry and operating current density as used by lee _",
    "_ , and observed a discrepancy of less than 1@xmath2 between the two methods .",
    "the comparison between the two approaches is shown in table 1 .",

    "we present magnetic field analysis results of a toroidal - type smes magnet calculated via _ radia _ ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . a characteristic magnetic flux density pattern of the center plane of the toroid is exhibited in fig .",
    "4a , while typical perpendicular , @xmath18 , and tangential , @xmath19 , flux density profiles along the radial direction of a single pancake coil are shown in fig .",
    "4b . for this particular simulation the operating current of the magnet",
    "is taken to be 960 a , while the maximum perpendicular magnetic flux density , tangential magnetic flux density and stored energy of the simulated device obtained from the simulation are shown to be 1.01 t , 9.00 t and 2.68 mj , respectively .",
    "the discrepancies between the maxima of the _ i _ ) perpendicular magnetic flux density , and _ ii _ ) tangential magnetic flux density , obtained via fem and _ radia _ were shown to be on the order of 2@xmath2 , confirming _ radia _",
    "s validity and reliability as an alternative tool to fem for magnetic field analyses of smes devices .",
    "one of the conclusions one can immediately draw from the analysis of the field distribution , as evidenced in fig .",
    "4a , is that the field is mostly confined inside the coil .",
    "being able to confine the magnetic field inside the coil is important for a number of reasons : _ i _ ) large field gradients could be avoided from the coil edges ( thus affecting the @xmath20 of the wire ) , and _ ii _ ) stray fields are generally detrimental to electronic devices located in the vicinity of the magnet .",
    "thus , smes designs with large numbers of coils may be preferred for as long as geometrical and critical current limitations are considered and met .",
    "not surprisingly , the highest @xmath21 s are found at the inner rim of an individual coil , nearest the center of the torus along the _ z _ = 0 plane , as evidenced in fig . 4 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath21 does not exhibit a _",
    "y_-axis mirror symmetry through the center of the coil , which is clearly due to the higher density of current - carrying elements closer to the torus center . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath22 is shown to be several times smaller than @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 is supposed to vanish in the case of a perfect toroidal smes with a continuum of coils .",
    "however , there is always a finite @xmath22 for a smes magnet built up with a discrete number of coils .",
    "it should be noted that although @xmath22 is several times smaller than @xmath21 , ybco tapes are marked by a large anisotropy in the critical current density ( @xmath23 ) , and therefore the maximum @xmath22 determines the current density cutoff that ought to be compared against the @xmath20 used in smes design .",
    "the ac loss calculations are performed using a simplified algorithm .",
    "the loss originating from the field over the penetration threshold is calculated using the accepted brandt - indenbom equation @xcite , which takes into account the flat tape geometry of 2 g wires as well as demagnetization effects .",
    "once the smes geometry is specified ( see section 2.4 ) , we feed the critical current density curves for _ i _ ) mgb@xmath0 and _ ii _ ) 2 g ybco tape for different temperatures and field ranges into the code . the algorithm fits all @xmath20 curves for a given superconducting type at the specified temperature and the fitting parameters are stored for later use .",
    "subsequently , the magnetic field is scanned inside the coil and the maximal @xmath24 , @xmath25 , is utilized in the calculation of the minimal @xmath26 , which would serve as the smes design bottleneck .",
    "the ratio of a trial value of the current density , @xmath27 , to @xmath28 @xcite , is an indicator of the stability of the system , and is known as the `` _ _ load factor _ _ '' . depending on the value of the load factor",
    ", our algorithm chooses whether the thickness ought to increase or decrease in order for the requirement to be met .",
    "our load factor is set at 70@xmath2 of @xmath26 , so if @xmath29 , the algorithm increases the coil thickness and reduces @xmath17 by a proportionate amount since the total energy is proportional to the square of the current .",
    "as long as the current is maintained at the same value , then so is the energy within a first order of approximation .",
    "analogously , if @xmath30 , the code `` removes '' turns ( and proportionately increases @xmath31 ) , until @xmath32 .",
    "the increase of the coil thickness is essential in order to avoid a quench when the critical current density of the superconducting wire is exceeded .",
    "the design flow of the entire optimization process is shown in fig .",
    "5    once the smes configuration is optimized , the algorithm performs the same operation as a function of _ i _ ) coil radius ( _ cr _ ) and _ ii _ ) coil width ( _ w _ ) .",
    "_ cr _ is a continuous variable for the purposes of the simulation , and therefore it could be varied in steps of arbitrary size . on the other hand , _ w _ is a multiple of either the diameter of the wire ( in the case of mgb@xmath0 , or the width of the tape ( in the case of 2 g wire ) .",
    "then , _ i _ ) the total energy , @xmath33 , of the optimized configuration is computed , _ ii _ ) the ac losses are calculated as well , and _ iii _ )",
    "@xmath33 is divided by the total wire mass of the smes , resulting in the energy density , @xmath34 .      upon designing the smes geometry based on a given toroidal radius and coil dimensions",
    "@xcite , we specify the wire characteristics of two different conductors : _ i _ ) a mgb@xmath0 wire which we assume in our calculation is a monofilamentary strand of mgb@xmath0 , manufactured by hyper tech research , inc . , as discussed by li _",

    "the rapid advances in applied superconductivity , such as the successful implementation of pulsed - laser deposition techniques to grow iron - chalcogenide superconducting film on metal substrates @xcite will hopefully lead to the development of commercial fe - based superconducting wire in the near future , as well .",
    "the mgb@xmath0 wire our simulation is based upon was manufactured via an internal magnesium diffusion ( imd ) method .",

    "empirically , @xmath20 could be fitted via a stretched exponential or a power - law form ( depending on the model of choice ) .",

    "when stretched exponential or power - law experimental data is fitted with the appropriate function , the fitting algorithm typically follows a @xmath36 approach , _",
    "i.e. _ , the effective fit is that which reduces the sum of the squares of the differences between the fit and the data points .",
    "consequently , the part of the function most susceptible to errors will be the tail , since , in our case , small changes in the shape of the curve would lead to big changes in the critical current density . therefore , for @xmath37 we produced a series of curves relevant in different field ranges . for @xmath38 t we used the entire magnetic field range . for 1 t@xmath39 t , we used @xmath20 above 1 t , for 2 t@xmath40 t we used the full critical current set above 2 t , and so on .",
    "if the highest scanned @xmath24 exceeds the highest available experimental data @xmath24 , the whole process is automatically aborted .",
    "we noticed a dramatic improvement in the field consistency , which is most clearly manifest in the relatively smooth energy density surfaces , exhibited in the results and discussion section .",
    "analytical fits of double - bending functions were used to obtain functional forms for @xmath6 s at different temperatures for both 2 g ybco and mgb@xmath0 wires . in principle",
    ", double - bending functions have been shown to be very effective in fitting the front and tail ends of @xmath20 , as if the two data curvatures are distinguishable @xcite , very much in the spirit of the data parsing used in the current research effort . however , being able to discern between two functional forms needed for a fit would require a much greater density of @xmath20 data points , which would be a necessary requirement for a realistic smes engineering .",

    "however , there are a number of prospective smes applications which require stored energies @xmath41  @xmath10 j , and most of our efforts have been focused predominantly on that energy range , particularly when considering overall dimensions on the 1  2 meter scale",
    ". the dimensional considerations of such a device are very important , especially if it is to be transportable and/or integrated with other technological instruments .    in order to devise the algorithm that assesses the maximal internal magnetic field , we consider two @xmath42 joule smes design cases at 4.2 k :",

    "then , we scan the magnetic field of the mgb@xmath0 smes coil transversely , going through the middle of the coil and assessing the absolute value of @xmath24 in the mgb@xmath0 case , where the field is expected to be the highest ( see inset of fig .",

    "thus , instead of picking the maximal point from the scan ( the weakest point ) , we identify its location , and fit the data points on either side of the singularity with a tenth order polynomial and get the mean of the two functions at the intersection ( maximal point ) location .",
    "we get @xmath25 = 10.68 t using this algorithm , which is consistent with the cusp at 50 mm from the inner edge of the coil .",
    "this procedure has led to smooth analytic energy density surfaces , to be discussed later .",

    "here , we see that while ac losses in mgb@xmath0 decrease monotonically with @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( fig .",
    "7b ) , in the case of ybco they increase until reaching a maximum ( fig 7f ) .    the critical current decreases with an increase in @xmath24 , suggesting that the evolution of @xmath45 would depend on the balance of the two .",
    "the wire in a coil carries transport current and simultaneously experiences an applied magnetic field generated by the neighboring turns and from the rest of the smes , thus ac losses in a coil are expected to be a combination of both transport and magnetization losses @xcite .",
    "an example of the complexity of ac losses could be observed in the behavior of the ac losses as a function of coil dimensions ( fig . 7b and 7f ) . while in the case of mgb@xmath0 the losses decrease monotonically as a function of @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( fig .",
    "7f ) , the opposite is observed in the case of ybco , and furthermore , a maximum is seen to form in the @xmath65 plane .",
    "the conserved quantity in our simulation is the load factor and not energy , which increases with the coil dimensions .",
    "that would mean that to first order we should expect comparable transport losses in the @xmath71 plane .",
    "however , the reduced proximity of the coils in the geometric space would lead to reduction in the inductive losses , which in the ybco case likely dominate the ac loss contribution .",
    "therefore , identifying ac loss maxima is particularly useful for 2g - based smes devices , particularly for cases where the large radius is fixed .",
    "we can conclude from observing the simulations results that ac losses for large energy storage devices ( @xmath78 j and beyond ) are quite irrelevant .",
    "notice that the highest @xmath45 s observed are smaller than 0.5 mj and 2 mj per cycle for ybco and mgb@xmath0 ( see fig 7 and 8) , respectively , whereas the lowest stored energy is 100 mj for both smes varieties .",
    "the ac loss is approximately given by the ratio between filament size and coil radius .",
    "since these are large coils ( @xmath11 m ) , and filament is 12 mm , we would expect an ac loss on the order of 1@xmath2 , which is roughly what the calculation shows .",
    "the toroidal geometry may reduce this figure ever so slightly .",
    "however , we note that for devices that store lower energies ( @xmath79 j ) ac losses will tend to have a very profound effect , and they must be duly subtracted from the stored energy values for proper accounting of device efficiency . given the complicated dependencies of ac losses on device geometry , we can see how at lower stored energies ( @xmath79 j ) , @xmath34 will most likely exhibit a non - monotonic behavior in the @xmath71 plane , where our _ radia_-based algorithm will have an even greater relevance in locating design `` sweet spots '' .",
    "+    finally , we would like to address the cost aspect of the two types of smes devices we are considering . after optimizing each of them at every point in configuration space , we were able to get an estimate of the overall length of wire needed ( see fig .",
    "one thing to notice is that the mgb@xmath0-based device would require significantly more wire , in absolute length , for comparable amount of stored energy when compared to its ybco counterpart ( see table 3 ) .",
    "+    @l*15@l smes type & @xmath80(@xmath67 = 400 mm , @xmath68 = 100 mm)(km ) & @xmath80(@xmath67 = 700 mm , @xmath68 = 200 mm ) ( km ) + ybco & 130 & 341 + mgb@xmath0 & 332 & 1,018 +    therefore , in order to build a 2 g wire - based smes intended to store 100 mj of energy , on the order of several millions of dollars need to be allocated for 2 g wire purchase at today s market prices . in terms of the sheer benefit offered by reduced weight , and amount of materials used , 2 g wire is currently the obvious choice for large - stored energy , large energy density smes device .",
    "in this paper we demonstrated the viability of _ radia _ as a cpu - efficient semi - analytical method for optimizing prospective superconducting energy - storage devices . by altering various device parameters , such as coil radius and thickness",
