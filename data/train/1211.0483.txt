    "the theoretical study of relativistic electron - atom collisions is fundamental to our understanding of many aspects in plasma physics and astrophysics .",
    "the development of electron - atom collision studies has also been strongly motivated by the need of data for testing and developing suitable theories of the scattering and collision process , and providing a tool for obtaining detailed information on the structure of the target atoms and molecules .",
    "many authors have studied this process using numerical tools .",

    "_ @xcite employed , the r - matrix method with nonrelativistic and relativistic approximations for the hydrogen like @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ions , where the case of transitions @xmath4 and @xmath5 as well as those between fine structure @xmath6 levels was considered .",

    "they have found that a simple formal analogy links the analytical expressions of the unpolarized differential cross section without laser and the unpolarized differential cross section in the presence of a laser field .    the aim of this contribution is to add some new physical insights and to show that the non - relativistic formalism becomes enable to describe particles with hight kinetic energies . before we present the results of our investigation ,",
    "we first begin by sketching the main steps of our treatment . for pedagogical purposes ,",
    "we begin by the most basic results of our work using atomic units ( a.u ) in which one has ( @xmath12 ) , where @xmath13 is the electron mass at rest , and which will be used throughout this work .",
    "we will also work with the metric tensor @xmath14 and the lorentz scalar product which is defined by @xmath15 .",

    "the function @xmath24 is the electron wave function , described by a free dirac spinor normalized to the volume @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are the semirelativistic wave functions of the hydrogen atom where the index @xmath27 and @xmath28 stand for the initial and final states respectively .",
    "the semirelativistic wave function of the atomic hydrogen is the darwin wave function for bound states @xcite , which is given by : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the binding energy of the ground state of atomic hydrogen and @xmath31 is given by : @xmath32 it represents a quasi relativistic bound state wave function , accurate to first order in @xmath33 in the relativistic corrections ( and normalized to the same order ) , with @xmath34 being the non - relativistic bound state hydrogenic function .",

    "then , after some analytic computations , we get for @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 the following result : @xmath79 it is clear that the situation is different than in elastic collision @xcite , since we have no singularity in the case ( @xmath80 )    behavior of the probability density for radial darwin wave function compared with that of the dirac wave function for small distances and for increasing values of the atomic charge number.,width=3,height=3 ]",

    "this is routinely done using reduce @xcite .",
    "we consider the unpolarized dcs .",
    "therefore , the various polarization states have the same probability and the actual calculated spinorial part is given by summing over the final polarization @xmath82 and averaging aver the initial polariztion @xmath83 .",

    "in presenting our results it is convenient to consider separately those corresponding to non - relativistic regime ( the relativistic parameter @xmath91 ) and those related to relativistic one ( the relativistic parameter @xmath92 ) . before beginning the discussion of the obtained results , it is worthwhile to recall the meaning of some abbreviation that will appear throughout this section .",
    "the nrdcs stands for the nonrelativistic differential cross section , where nonrelativistic plane wave are used to describe the incident and scattered electrons .",
    "the srdcs stands for the semirelativistic differential cross section . + we begin our numerical work , by the study of the dependence of the probability density for radial darwin and dirac wave functions , on the atomic charge number @xmath93 .",
    "as long as the condition @xmath94 is verified , the use of darwin wave function do not have any influence at all on the results at least in the first order of perturbation theory .",
    "so , the semi - relativistic treatment when @xmath93 increases may generate large errors but not in the case of this work . in this paper",
    ", we can not have numerical instabilities since there are none .",
    "for the sake of illustration , we give below the behavior of the probability density for radial darwin wave functions as well as that of the exact relativistic dirac wave functions for different values of @xmath93 .",

    ", it appears from figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] that in the limit of high electron kinetic energy , the effects of the additional spin terms and the relativity begin to be noticeable and that the non - relativistic formalism is no longer applicable .",
    "also a pick in the vicinity of @xmath100 is clearly observed .",
