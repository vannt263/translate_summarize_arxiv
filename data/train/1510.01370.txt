    "in the competitive environment of semiconductor manufacturing , accurate reliability prediction results in significant time - to - market and profitability improvements .",
    "prediction quality depends on the manufacturer s ability to characterize process - related instabilities and defects in a given design .",
    "burn - in stresses are commonly performed on products to accelerate the fabrication process failure mechanism and to screen out design flaws .    at sub - micron process technology nodes",
    ", it has been suggested that burn - in stress is likely to affect the negative bias temperature instability ( nbti ) @xcite , which in turn will affect the operational performance of circuits .",
    "the objective of the work described in this paper is to evaluate the effect of burn - in stress on nbti , with reference to the performance effect on analogue circuits .",
    "a digital - to - analogue converter ( dac ) module was selected as a case study . with device reliability models and circuit simulation",
    ", this paper analyses the effect of burn - in stress on the shift of key dac parameters such as the integral non - linearity ( inl ) , differential non - linearity ( dnl ) and gain error .",
    "since the advent of 90 nm cmos technology , nbti has become one of the top circuit reliability issues for both pmos and nmos devices , because it can severely impact product performance over time . compared with previous process generations ,",
    "nmos hot electron degradation is no longer of such concern . at 45 nm , positive bias temperature instability ( pbti )",
    "has an effect on nmos devices that is about half of that of nbti on pmos devices @xcite .",
    "several studies have reported on the impact of nbti on the performance of analogue and digital components .",
    "it was shown by kang _",
    "et al _ @xcite that the degradation in maximum circuit delay closely follows the trend of threshold - voltage ( @xmath0 ) degradation in a single pmos transistor .",
    "their finding was based on a detailed analysis of circuit performance with respect to nbti degradation , particularly focusing on the maximum delay degradation of random - logic circuits .",
    "et al _ @xcite confirmed the effect of nbti degradation under ac conditions .",
    "in addition , kufluoglu _ et al _ @xcite addressed both pmos - level measurement delay effects and real - time degradation and recovery by simulation . a study performed by bhardwaj _",
    "et al _ @xcite revealed that circuit - level nbti models can be further improved by considering various process technology - dependent parameters which lead to process variation effects .",
    "ball _ et al _ @xcite have explored the burn - in implications for sram circuits .",
    "their approach has demonstrated that the minimum operating voltage , @xmath1 , increases during burn - in as a result of nbti and is of the order of the nbti - induced @xmath0 shift .",
    "schroder and babcock @xcite have thoroughly studied the time to failure ( @xmath2 ) relationship to voltage and temperature effects . from their analysis , @xmath2 is affected as follows :    * when the burn - in stress voltage , @xmath3 increases , @xmath2 decreases ; * when the difference between the nominal voltage , @xmath4 , and @xmath0 increases , @xmath2 decreases ; and * @xmath2 is inversely proportional to temperature .",
    "the worst case situation is when the system is operated at a high voltage most of the time .",
    "however , nbti degradation can also affect the minimum operating voltage , @xmath1 , as noted above .",
    "nbti degradation is less sensitive to @xmath4 than is nmos hot carrier ( nhc ) degradation .",
    "however , it is more sensitive to temperature @xcite and occurs even when the transistor is not switching , as long as it is in inversion .",
    "the following equation shows how the threshold voltage shift of a pmos transistor , as a function of the applied voltage and temperature , affects the @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "@xmath5    @xmath6    @xmath7*c \\right ) \\label{eq3}\\ ] ]    @xmath8^\\beta \\label{eq4}\\ ] ]    where    * @xmath9 is the scaled time to failure in seconds due to voltage and temperature scaling dependencies ; * @xmath10 is the mean time to failure at the selected fail criterion ( fc ) ; * @xmath11 is the geometry scaling function for ageing ; * @xmath12 is the electric field acceleration factor ; * @xmath13 is the electric field ( @xmath14 ) across the gate oxide , of thickness @xmath15 ; * @xmath16 is the junction temperature ; * @xmath17 is the thermal activation energy ; * @xmath18 is the @xmath0 shift , defined as the failure criterion for modelling ; * @xmath19 is a process - dependent variable",
    ".    this effect can be simulated by applying a signal to the circuit of interest and summing the degradation from each time step . in this case , the effect of the shift in @xmath0 , the threshold voltage , for a time varying waveform , can be calculated by using the quasi - static time integral with time in equation ( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "@xmath20    lee _ et al _ demonstrated the nbti effect on product reliability degradation @xcite .",
    "in addition , their simulator includes other reliability mechanisms such as hot carrier injection ( hci ) and time - domain - dielectric - breakdown ( tddb ) @xcite .",
    "the simulation demonstrates the validity of using a tddb degradation model to predict the failure rate of a complicated microprocessor .",
    "the model is derived using large discrete capacitor / device tddb data with various temperature , voltage and geometry considerations .",
    "it is noted that even though nbti degradation occurs under elevated voltage and temperature , the nbti phenomena show some relaxation .",
    "this occurs due to passivation of nbti - induced silicon dangling bonds by the hydrogen which has diffused from the gate oxide to the interface @xcite .",
    "there are two types of relaxation that need to be seriously considered for circuit reliability modelling .",
    "1 .   fast relaxation : this relaxation occurs as soon as the stress is removed .",
    "it is responsible for reduced ac degradation even after accounting for the transistor ` on ' time .",
    "however , this relaxation mode is not covered in our reliability simulations .",
    "2 .   extended relaxation : this relaxation occurs as the device is kept unbiased .",
    "our reliability analysis accounts for this relaxation mode .",
    "figure [ figure 12 ] illustrates the two relaxation modes . because relaxation lessens the effects of nbti , a device under continuous usage may suffer a higher degradation than the reliability simulation predicts .",
    "we approximate a complex integrated circuit with a series failure model .",
    "we also assume each failure mechanism has an exponential lifetime distribution . in this way ,",
    "the failure rate of each failure mechanism is treated as a constant .",
    "with these two assumptions , the reliability simulation models , which are often used to extrapolate failure rates , can be validated based on available data .",
    "for this work , intel s internal tool , relsim ( reliability simulation ) , is used to predict changes in device and circuit performance over a product s lifetime .",
    "it further allows simulation of post - degraded circuits to ensure circuit designs meet reliability requirements at end - of - life ( eol ) @xcite .",
    "the reliability simulation methodology used in this paper is shown in figure [ fig : anicepicture ] .",
    "the simulation has two modes of operation .",
    "the first mode , the stress mode , calculates the transistor @xmath0 shift .",
    "the second mode , the playback mode , simulates degraded circuit performance based on stress mode results .",
    "the simulation is conducted to cover elevated ranges of process , voltage and temperature ( pvt ) .",
    "the dac reliability simulation is run in a 3-step process in the design environment .    1 .",
    "simulate the non - degraded behaviour at the typical circuit operating condition ( @xmath4 and temperature ) .",
    "2 .   in stress mode , calculate the amount of degradation on each transistor . this is done at a slightly higher voltage and temperature to get a more conservative estimate of the degradation .",
    "3 .   in playback mode , simulate the degraded circuit , using the degradation calculated in the stress mode .",
    "the stress mode is used to report the degradation of a circuit at future times chosen by the user .",
    "the user provides the ageing time , the ageing method ( e.g. none , fixed , uniform , bias and temperature user parameters ) and a reference degradation value .",
    "also necessary is a degradation parameter file that contains parameters for mos device stress calculations . during the stress simulation ,",
    "a stress file is generated at each specified future time .",
    "the stress file contains the stressed ( degraded ) values of each mos device in the circuit .",
    "the degraded circuit values from the initial stress mode can be subsequently used in playback mode .",
    "the playback mode produces output signal waveforms for an aged circuit .",
    "the information from a stress file is read and a perturbation function is applied to the mos depending on the degradation model chosen in the stress mode .    the reliability simulator has been used for transistor ageing modelling across major process technologies from 250 nm down to 14 nm @xcite .",
    "the models have been extensively calibrated against actual silicon test chip data to ensure accuracy @xcite .",
    "the simulator can be used to model the minimum @xmath4 ( @xmath1 ) degradation effects .",
    "it is able to find the worst case corners , and takes voltages on all nodes into account .",
    "the ac nbti modelling capability provides more accurate reliability performance predictions than static dc worst - case models .",
    "furthermore , it can be calibrated with the ac circuits to include nbti recovery , similar to that in @xcite .",
    "another key advantage of this reliability simulator is that the pmos degradation is modelled with threshold voltage shifts based on non - uniform i - v degradation .",
    "the simulator models the effect on the mos transistors i - v characteristics and the effect on the device parameters and applied voltages . under the pmos degradation model ,",
    "it is suitable for both digital and analogue simulations .",
    "for this case study a video dac has been used .",
    "the performance of the dac is critical for achieving excellent video quality .",
    "the required accuracy of the dac is based on the differential gain and phase distortion specifications for tv @xcite .",
    "the dac is designed as a current steering architecture to achieve high accuracy and low distortion of the analogue video signal .",
    "the signal range is between zero volts to the maximum nominal analogue video signal swing of 1.3v .",
    "the digital input to each dac is latched on the rising edge of each clock and is converted to an analogue current . for a given digital input , the current source outputs are summed together and directed to the output pin by the differential current switches .",
    "an analogue video voltage is created from the dac output current flowing into the termination resistors . to determine the required output current of the dac circuit , the video level specifications for the various video formats along with the effective load termination",
    "are measured .",
    "the lsb output voltage , which ranges between 684 @xmath21v and 1.27 mv , is a function of the supported video format .",
    "given the circuit mismatch sensitivity of this circuit , paired devices are designed accordingly ; typically with greater lengths .",
    "the dac is composed of parallel current switches .",
    "this so - called crt dac is widely used in high speed applications specifically for its speed and linearity .",
    "the circuit is referenced to an analogue power supply which consists of an array of pmos current sources and differential current switches ( figure [ figure8 ] ) .",
    "this dac operates at 3.3v nominal voltage and implemented in 90 nm process technology .",
    "it has been shown that the 90 nm crt dac has sufficient headroom in terms of the circuit performance degradation throughout a 7-year lifetime .",
    "the @xmath22 degradation is calculated by scaling the gate voltages to the typical analogue operating voltages .",
    "the extrapolation is given by equation ( [ eq8 ] ) @xcite .",
    "@xmath23 where :    * @xmath24 is the process related pre - factor ; * @xmath0 is the threshold voltage ; * @xmath17 is the activation energy in ev ( @xmath17 = 0.145 ev was chosen by experiment ) * @xmath19 is the transconductance parameter ( @xmath19 = 0.75 was chosen by experiment ) ; * @xmath25 is the gate to source voltage ; * @xmath26 is the boltzmann constant ; * @xmath27 is the temperature in kelvin ; * @xmath28 is the time in years ; and * @xmath29 is the voltage acceleration and exponent factor ( @xmath29 = 0.181 was chosen by experiment ) .",
    "for our case study , nbti analysis was performed on the dac circuit shown in figure [ figure6 ] .",
    "we simulated the nbti behaviour of the dac under normal and extreme conditions .",
    "the reliability simulation playback mode analysis was done under the typical corners , for pre - layout schematics with proper loading . for this analysis ,",
    "the circuit was aged for a 7-year lifetime to check the dac circuit functionality and the effect of nbti degradation under burn - in conditions .",
    "table [ table1 ] shows a comparison between three different conditions .",
    ".reliability simulation parameters across three different conditions [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the nbti degradation observed in the reliability simulation of a dac circuit revealed that under a severe stress condition such as a 40% increase in the nominal voltage supply , a significant voltage threshold mismatch , beyond the 2 mv limit , was recorded .",
    "a burn - in experiment on the dac circuit was performed to verify the simulation . a correlation between the simulation results and the burn - in behaviour",
    "was observed , but the change in the gain error was significantly greater than predicted .",
