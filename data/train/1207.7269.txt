    "phase - change materials based on chalcogenide alloys are attracting a lot of interest due to their ability to undergo reversible and fast transitions between the amorphous and crystalline phases upon heating @xcite .",
    "this property is exploited in rewriteable optical media ( dvd , blu - ray discs ) and phase change non volatile memories ( pcm ) .",
    "the strong optical and electronic contrast between the crystal and the amorphous allows discriminating between the two phases that correspond to the two states of the memory .",
    "the pcm devices , first proposed by ovshinsky in the late 1960 s @xcite , offer extremely fast programming , extended cycling endurance , good reliability and inexpensive , easy integration .",
    "a pcm is essentially a resistor of a thin film of a chalcogenide alloy ( typically ge@xmath4sb@xmath4te@xmath5 , gst ) with a low field resistance that changes by several orders of magnitude across the phase change . in memory operations , cell read out",
    "is performed at low bias .",
    "programming the memory requires instead a relatively large current to heat up the chalcogenide and induce the phase change , either the melting of the crystal and subsequent amorphization ( reset ) or the recrystallization of the amorphous ( set ) .",
    "the key property that makes these materials suitable for applications in pcm is the high speed of the transformation which leads to full crystallization on the time scale of 10 - 100 ns upon joule heating .",
    "what makes some chalcogenide alloys so special in this respect and so different from most amorphous semiconductors is , however , still a matter of debate .    in this paper , we demonstrate by means of atomistic molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations that the phase change compound gete displays a very high mobility in the supercooled liquid phase down to very low temperatures @xmath6 leading to a breakdown of the stokes - einstein relation @xmath7 ( ser ) between diffusivity @xmath0 and viscosity @xmath8 .",
    "the breakdown of ser in the supercooled liquid phase , which is typical of a fragile liquid @xcite , is actually the key to understand the fast crystallization behavior of these materials as discussed below .",
    "supercooled liquids are classified as fragile or strong on the basis of the temperature dependence of their viscosity @xcite .",
    "an ideal strong liquid shows an arrhenius behavior of the viscosity @xmath8 from the melting temperature t@xmath9 down to the glass transition temperature t@xmath10 . on the contrary , in a fragile liquid @xmath8",
    "follows an arrhenius behavior only above a cross - over temperature t@xmath11 below which a vogel - tammann - fulcher ( vtf ) function @xmath12 is customarily used to reproduce the data with @xmath13 , @xmath14 and t@xmath15 as fitting parameters @xcite .",
    "the viscosity in a fragile liquid shows a steep rise by approaching t@xmath10 which according to the ser would lead to a strong decrease in the atomic mobility . on the other hand ,",
    "the self diffusion coefficient @xmath0 controls both the speed of crystal growth @xmath16 and the steady state nucleation rate @xmath17 .",
    "in fact , classical nucleation theory @xcite predicts that @xmath18 and @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the free energy difference between the liquid ( or amorphous ) and the crystalline phases and @xmath21 is the formation free energy of the critical nucleus given in turn by @xmath22 with @xmath23 interface energy .",
    "@xmath20 is the driving force for crystallization that decreases by increasing temperature and finally vanishes at t@xmath9 . in phase change materials , due to the breakdown of ser",
    ", the diffusivity can be very high just above t@xmath10 in spite of a large viscosity .",
    "consequently @xmath0 can reach high values at temperatures much lower than t@xmath9 where a large driving force for crystallization is present .",
    "a breakdown of ser in gst has actually been suggested by recent measurements of the crystallization rate by orava et al .",
    "@xcite . still ,",
    "further evidences of the breakdown of ser are needed to support the crucial assumptions made by orava _",
    "_ to infer the viscosity from their only data of differential scanning calorimetry .    to this aim we performed md simulations by using a classical interatomic potential @xcite we generated by fitting a large database of density functional energies by means of the neural network ( nn ) method introduced in ref",
    "so far we have restricted ourselves to the binary compound gete which is also under scrutiny for applications in pcm and which shares most of the properties with the more commonly used gst @xcite .",
    "the nn potential displays an accuracy close to that of the underlying density functional theory ( dft ) framework at a much reduced computational load that scales linearly with the size of the system .",
    "it allows us to simulate several thousands of atoms for tens of ns , which is well beyond present - day capabilities of dft molecular dynamics .",
    "the nn interatomic potential of gete was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite by fitting a huge database of dft energies by means of the method introduced by behler and parrinello @xcite .",
    "the database consists of the total energies of about 30000 configurations of 64- , 96- , and 216-atom supercells computed by employing the the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) exchange and correlation functional @xcite and norm conserving pseudopotentials .",
    "the nn potential displays an accuracy close to that of the underlying dft - pbe framework whose reliability in describing structural and dynamical properties of gete and other phase change materials has been validated in several previous works by our @xcite and other groups @xcite .",
    "the simulations were performed with the nn code runner  @xcite and a 4096-atom cubic supercell by using the dl@xmath24poly  @xcite code as md driver .",
    "the time step was set to 2  fs , and constant temperature was enforced by a stochastic thermostat  @xcite .",
    "it turned out that in order to reproduce the equilibrium density of the liquid at t@xmath9 , an empirical van der waals ( vdw ) correction had to be added to the nn potential .",
    "this was done by using the scheme proposed by grimme @xcite with the @xmath25 parameter tuned to 0.55 to reproduce the experimental equilibrium volume of the liquid at t@xmath9@xcite .",
    "the experimental equilibrium volume of the amorphous and crystalline phases are instead well reproduced by the nn potential without the need of the vdw interaction @xcite .",
    "the inability of the nn potential in reproducing the equilibrium volume of the liquid can be traced back to the presence of nanovoids in the melt @xcite . in the liquid",
    "the nanovoids can coalesce and increase in size by decreasing the density which results into a reduced tensile stress upon expansion .",
    "this effect is hindered by vdw interactions .",
    "nanovoids are also present in the amorphous phase @xcite , but their distribution can not change with temperature because of the low atomic mobility in the amorphous phase . the calculated linear thermal expansion coefficient ( @xmath26=@xmath27 ) of the liquid at t@xmath9 with the nn+vdw potential turned out to be 4.73 @xmath28 10@xmath29 k@xmath30 to be compared with the experimental value of 3.73 @xmath28 10@xmath29 k@xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the added vdw interaction acts just as a volume dependent term in the equation of state of the liquid but it is not included in the md simulations discussed below .",
    "dft calculations of the self - diffusion coefficient at two selected temperatures were performed by molecular dynamics simulations within the born - oppenheimer approach by using the code cp2k  @xcite ; kohn - sham orbitals were expanded in a triple - zeta - valence plus polarization gaussian - type basis set and the charge density was expanded in a planewave basis set with a cut - off of 100  ry to efficiently solve the poisson equation within the quickstep scheme @xcite .",
    "goedecker - type pseudopotentials @xcite with four and six valence electrons were used for ge and te , respectively .",
    "brillouin zone integration was restricted to the @xmath31 point of the 216-atom supercell .",
    "the same framework was used in our previous dft molecular dynamics simulations of gete @xcite .",
    "to study the properties of the supercooled liquid , we first assessed the ability of the nn potential , and thus of the underlying dft - pbe framework , to reproduce t@xmath9 .",
    "the melting temperature was computed by means of thermodynamic integration @xcite that yielded t@xmath9=1001 k very close to the experimental value at normal pressure of 998 k @xcite . to obtain t@xmath9 , we first computed the difference in the helmholtz free energy @xmath32 between the nn system and a reference system for which an analytic expression for @xmath32 is known , at a given temperature @xmath33 and density @xmath34 .",
    "namely @xmath35 where the average is taken over a md simulation with the potential @xmath36 .",
    "the temperature and density were set to the experimental values at the melting point at normal conditions @xcite .",
    "the reference system was chosen as an einstein crystal for the solid and a lennard - jones fluid @xcite for the liquid . in the next step ,",
    "the chemical potentials were evaluated by integrating the free energy as a function of density starting from @xmath34 @xcite    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the number of particles in the simulation cell , and the parameters @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 were obtained by fitting the pressure dependence of the density using @xmath42 by equating the chemical potential of the two phases one obtains a transition pressure of -0.44 gpa at the chosen temperature t@xmath43=998 k. from the calculated clausius - clapeyron equation ( @xmath44=6.85 k / gpa from the calculated @xmath45=@xmath46 and @xmath47 on the theoretical melting line at t=998 k ) we then obtained the theoretical melting temperature at normal pressure which is t@xmath9=1001 k.    we then analyzed the properties of the supercooled liquid below t@xmath9 by computing independently @xmath8 and @xmath0 in microcanonical md simulations . the volume of the supercooled liquid was scaled with temperature according to the thermal expansion coefficient ( @xmath26 is little dependent on temperature ) given in sec .",

    "overall the system is thus quenched from 1000 k to 500 k in 250 ps .",
    "at each temperature statistical averages are then collected on microcanonical simulations up to 2 ns long for the calculation of the viscosity as discussed below .",
    "we first computed @xmath0 from the atomic mean square displacement on the time scale of 50 ps on which the system does not crystallize at any temperature we considered .",

    "the crystallization of the supercooled liquid or of a highly mobile overheated amorphous phase might take place in a different manner with respect to the crystallization of the amorphous phase at temperatures below t@xmath10 which is of interest for data retention .",

    "<S> the application of amorphous chalcogenide alloys as data - storage media relies on their ability to undergo an extremely fast ( 10 - 100 ns ) crystallization once heated at sufficiently high temperature . </S>",
    "<S> however , the peculiar features that make these materials so attractive for memory devices still lack a comprehensive microscopic understanding . by means of large scale molecular dynamics simulations , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the supercooled liquid of the prototypical compound gete shows a very high atomic mobility ( @xmath0 @xmath1 10@xmath2 @xmath3/s ) down to temperatures close to the glass transition temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior leads to a breakdown of the stokes - einstein relation between the self - diffusion coefficient and the viscosity in the supercooled liquid . </S>",
    "<S> the results suggest that the fragility of the supercooled liquid is the key to understand the fast crystallization process in this class of materials . </S>"
