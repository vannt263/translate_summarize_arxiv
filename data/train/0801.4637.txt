    "in particular , the tori are predicted to exhibit prominent silicate dust features in either absorption or emission , depending on whether an agn is viewed with the torus edge - on ( type 2 ) or face - on ( type 1 ) .",

    "sturm et al . ( 2005 ) reported the first detection of 10 and 18 @xmath2 m silicate emission features in a low - luminosity liner ( ngc 3998 ) .",
    "comparison to the 10/18 @xmath2 m feature ratio of optically thin emission from silicate dust at different temperatures suggests a modest temperature ( @xmath3200k ) of the emitting dust .",
    "the presence of prominent 10@xmath2 m silicate emission features in agn covering a broad range in luminosity could be taken as direct evidence for the existence of an obscuring torus . however , it is not at all clear whether this emission actually arises from the inner regions of a face - on torus .",
    "depending on the size and composition of the grains , sublimation occurs between @xmath3  800 and 1500 k @xcite which is also the temperature range expected for silicate dust located near the hot inner torus wall .",
    "the lower temperature indicated for the emitting silicate dust can be interpreted as evidence for dust emission from regions located further away from the central heating source .",
    "several arguments support such a scenario .",
    "silicate emission has also been detected in type-2 qsos @xcite , whereas for an edge - on view of the torus , one would expect to see silicate in absorption only .",

    "these arguments indicate that silicate emission may originate in extended regions ( @xmath5 pc dimension ) .",

    ". the black body temperatures are free parameters allowed to vary continuously between their specified limits .",
    "the fourth component represents cool dust .",
    "as explained in paper i and in @xcite ( hereafter paper ii ) , this component is assumed to be dominated by reprocessed stellar emission from star forming regions in the host galaxy . to account for this component",
    "we introduce a cool black body with temperature limited to 35 - 65 k , a typical range in starburst galaxies . in paper",
    "i we demonstrated that on average the 7.7pah / fir ratio in our pg qsos is the same as in starburst dominated , local ulirgs .",
    "this fact indicates similar properties for the star formation in both galaxy types .",
    "hence the assumption of a cool black body ( t=35 - 65 k ) to account for the reprocessed stellar emission from star forming regions within the host galaxy is reasonable .",
    "we note that the irs spectra do not include a substantial part of the fir emission of the qsos .",
    "this limitation tends to shift the inferred best - fit temperature of this component towards higher values .",
    "in addition to intrinsic variations of the temperature of starburst dust , this bias is the reason we introduce a limited temperature range for this component .    to account for the contribution of star forming regions to the 4 - 40 @xmath2 m spectra of our sources , we use the iso - sws mid - ir spectrum of m82 ( from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as a starburst template spectrum .",
    "in particular , this template is used to fit the broad polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission features found in the _ spitzer_-irs range , which are clearly seen in some of our objects . these features are typical indicators for recent star formation .",
    "the ratio of pah emission to fir emission in galaxies is related to the average radiation field intensity , echoed in the 60/100 @xmath2 m flux ratio tracing the large grain temperature @xcite . by scaling the contribution of the cool black body relative to the contribution of the m82 template , the fitting routine has the freedom to take such a difference between m82 and the pg qsos into account .",
    "using starburst - dominated ulirg templates instead of m82 would be an alternative possibility . to exclude ambiguities regarding the power source ( agn or starburst ) of the template spectrum",

    "we found no significant differences ( in @xmath19 or the contributing components ) compared to the fits using the m82 template .",
    "this is due to the overall small contribution of the starburst template and the similarity between m82 and the brandl template .",
    "the contribution of the m82 starburst template is found to be consistent with the pah detections in paper i.    an important new ingredient of the present work is dust emission from the nlr . to fit the silicate emission , which is visible in nearly all of our qso spectra , we use dust nlr models based on those of @xcite .",
    "in contrast to torus models , our nlr models account for cooler , optically thin dust that is located further away from the central agn .",
    "the code used to generate these models , mappings iii , encompasses all dust - related processes , including stochastic heating , which allows individual small grains to reach high temperatures when heated by energetic photons . for the fits to the irs spectra",

    "however , the ionization parameter for a given incident flux increases by a factor of 10 , resulting in stronger higher ionization lines .",
    "the assumed density has no influence on the estimated distances of clouds from the agn and should be considered as an approximation . in section [ sec : discussion ] , we will discuss the nlr properties also taking line emission ( e.g. , [ nev ] ) into account . using the line emission , we find that a density of @xmath23@xmath24 is an upper limit for the density of the line emitting region .",

    "we note that in our case , the derived covering factors depend on the assumed column density of our models . for this reason ,",
    "the covering factor is uncertain due to the uncertainty of the real column density .",
    "fitting our sources with lower column densities than that assumed here ( @xmath31h@xmath32 ) leads to too large covering factors .",
    "on the other hand , increasing the column will only result in a small reduction in covering factor , since most of the incoming flux is absorbed by the dust in a cloud of @xmath31h@xmath32 .",
    "the covering factor is basically determined by the emitted flux of the model . a larger column depth means higher dust absorption and stronger ir emission , which results in a lower covering factor .",
    "however , the relationship is not linear due to the change of the dust opacity with wavelength and the cooling of dust at greater depths .",
    "source variability between the epochs of optical and our  observations may introduce another uncertainty . on average , this effect should cancel out , but it may explain the large covering factor ( 1.16 ) derived for pg1001 + 0054 .",
    "differences between single and multiple nlr models indicate further uncertainties in the covering factor , since the contribution of each nlr component is somewhat lower in the multiple nlr model fit ( the flux in multiple nlr model fits can be shared by similar components ) .",
    "the distance to the center of the hottest dust is related to the agn bolometric luminosity via our average scaling relation .",
    "if the cloud size is assumed to be constant , then its covering factor would decrease if the cloud is placed further away from the central source .",
    "another possibility is that rather than having discrete clouds , the entire ionization cone could be filled with dust . in this case",
    ", the covering factor does not correlate with distance . to test if the covering factor is correlated with the nlr contribution to the total ir flux or the bolometric agn luminosity , we tested for a correlation between the covering factor and the nlr contribution to the 15 @xmath2 m continuum source flux as well as to the total agn ir luminosity .",
    "no such correlation was found .",
    "the absence of a correlation may also reflect the uncertainty in our estimate of the covering factor      the typical distance found here for the silicate emitting dust is some 170 times larger than the dust sublimation distance and hence much further than assumed in canonical torus models .",
    "however , it is also smaller than `` typical '' dimensions assumed for the nlr .",
    "for example , @xcite have derived a luminosity dependent nlr dimension of roughly r(nlr)=2.1l([oiii])@xmath100 kpc , where l([oiii])@xmath101 is the [ oiii]5007  line luminosity in units of @xmath102 @xmath103 . for the sources in our sample ,",
    "this translates to a typical nlr dimension of 2 kpc ( the full range covered in our sample , using this relationship , is about 1 - 3 kpc ) .",
    "schmidt et al ( 2003 ) later investigated this relationship and found nlr dimensions that are about of factor 2 smaller for sources similar to the ones in our sample .",
    "these relationships were also discussed in @xcite and shown to be inconsistent with dimensions derived for the most luminous agn . regardless of the exact value",
    ", it seems that the dimensions found here for the silicate emitting dust are 5 - 10 times smaller than the nlr size derived from the [ oiii]5007   line luminosity .",
    "we have also looked at the line emission expected from gas clouds situated at the distance of the silicate emitting dust . observed line fluxes will be published in a forthcoming paper ( veilleux et al .",
    "2008 , in preparation ) .",
    "our continuum fitting procedure can only indicate the cloud distance .",
    "the line emission depends on the level of ionization of the gas ( the ionization parameter ) and hence on the gas density . while a detailed study of the nlr properties in quest qsos is beyond the scope of the present work , we mention here several of the more important conclusions .    *",
    "assuming a density of about @xmath104 , gives for the typical incident flux found here , an ionization parameter of about @xmath105 .",
    "for this ionization parameter , the high excitation lines of [ nev ] at 14.3 and 24.3 @xmath2 m can reach their observed luminosities , given the covering fractions we derive .",
    "however , the observed [ nev]24/[nev]14 line ratio ( typically found to be @xmath31 in our sample ) suggests that this density is too high .",
    "* for a lower density gas , of about @xmath106 , we get the required [ nev ] line ratio but the implied ionization parameter is so high that the [ nevi]7.6 @xmath2 m line is predicted to be much stronger than observed . * in all cases of @xmath107 ,",
    "the gas is too highly ionized to produce the strong observed lines of [ oiv ] 26 @xmath2 m and [ neiii ] 15.6 @xmath2 m .",
    "these lines can be reproduced for much higher densities ( lower ionization parameter ) but , in this case , the [ nev ] lines are predicted to be well below their observed luminosities .    in short",
    ", there is no way to produce all the strong observed nlr lines from a single component situated at roughly the same distance as the silicate emitting dust .",
    "none of these conclusions are very sensitive to the gas metallicity , the exact shape of the ionizing continuum , the relative reddening of optical and ir emission lines , or the exact nlr geometry .    given this analysis",
    "we conclude that the region emitting the strong silicate features can not represent the entire nlr .",
    "it can perhaps be associated with gas in the innermost nlr and the region emitting ` coronal ' lines from highly ionized species . in this scenario",
    "the extended portion of the nlr that produces most of the [ oiii]5007   emission , and probably also the intermediate ionization ir lines like [ neiii ] 15.6 and [ oiv]26 @xmath2 m , is of much larger dimensions , perhaps by an order of magnitude or so .",
    "all this will be discussed in more detail in a forthcoming paper .    while detailed models designed to fit the ir spectrum of the quest qsos are not yet available , some examples of the above line relationships can be found in the recent @xcite study of the ir spectrum of dusty nlr clouds .",
    "our finding of an extended silicate emitting region does not necessarily contradict torus models , since modified torus models ( e.g. nenkova et al .",
    "2002 - nenkova , m. , sirocky , m. , ivezic , z. , elitzur , m. , 2007 , submitted to apj ) allow for weak or absent silicate emission within a certain parameter range ( e.g. a certain clump distribution ) .",
    "this is also true for some face - on torus models with smooth dust distributions @xcite if certain parameters are assumed .",
    "a compact torus might be present and contribute strongly to the mir continuum but less to the observed silicate emission .",
    "many of the published torus models cited above predict some level of silicate emission for nearly face - on type-1 configurations , but often with a higher ratio of the 10 and 18@xmath2 m silicate features than required by the apparently ` cool ' dust found in our  spectra . in - depth comparison to the  spectra is needed and ongoing . to our knowledge , the first published result of this type is the fit of -observed silicate emission features in two type-1 agn to a torus model presented by @xcite .",
    "these authors assume a flared disc with a continuous dust distribution , whose inner radius is defined by the sublimation radius of the dust , plus host galaxy emission ( reprocessed stellar emission from dust in the host galaxy ) .",
    "they account for the different sublimation temperatures of silicate ( @xmath108=1000 k ) and graphite ( @xmath108=1500 k ) dust grains which can result in a up to five times smaller minimum radius for the graphite grains .",
    "this difference results in a dust layer composed only of graphite grains , which attenuates the x - ray and uv emission from the central source and is taken into account when the authors compute the silicate minimum radius .",
    "some of their fits ( e.g. , for pg1229 + 204 ( mrk771 ) and pg 2214 + 139 ( mrk304 ) ) of type-1 agn , which are constrained only by broadband photometry , do not reproduce the silicate emission features observed with _ spitzer _",

    ", their torus model shows silicate in absorption rather than in emission .",
    "the same is true for pg2214 + 139 , which shows strong silicate emission features in its _",
    "these discrepancies suggest that broad band data alone are not able to constrain properly the mir dust properties , since the wavelength sampling is too low .",
    "in contrast , their fits to two type-1 agn with mir  spectra ( pg0804 + 761 and pg1100 + 772 = 3c249.1 ) are satisfactory for both the silicate features and the broad band seds",
    ".    two elements of the @xcite models may contribute to this successful fit .",
    "first , the separate treatment of graphite and silicate sublimation moves the innermost silicate dust out in radius and behind some shielding graphite - only dust , resulting in cooler temperatures .",
    "results will sensitively depend on the exact values assumed for the sublimation temperatures .",
    "second , the two successful fits to  spectra are characterized by a very steep decrease of the total radial column density from the equatorial plane of the flared disc to its edge . while the column n@xmath109 is several 10@xmath110@xmath111 on the equator , it is about two orders of magnitude less near the surface . both factors combined imply a noticeable covering factor by dust with a column of several 10@xmath112@xmath111 at radii of order 1.2 - 36pc , with the silicate grains setting in only at @xmath35pc .",
    "while this still falls short by a fair factor from the radii @xmath375pc implied by our scaling relation ( for comparison we assume here the bolometric agn luminosity used in @xcite ) , it suggests that part of the successful fit by this torus model may be due to a related concept : a moderate column of dust away from the equatorial plane of the torus and well outside the sublimation radius .",
    "their fits to the mir  spectra of pg0804 + 761 and especially pg1100 + 772 are somewhat worse compared to our average fit quality , but we note that our assumed underlying continuum ( black bodies ) is less physical compared to a proper radiative transfer calculation .    a key challenge for torus models of silicate emission will be to explain silicate emission detected in some clear type-2 agns @xcite .",
    "the mir wavelength range is very important for constraining model parameters , since the silicate emission features are very sensitive to dust temperatures , geometries , and density distributions .",
    "salient agn properties linked to the circum - agn region include the type 1/2 ratio and the distribution of obscuring columns as determined from x - rays ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or the optical / near - infrared obscuration of the blr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "models explaining silicate emission in terms of the torus alone need to fit those as well .",
    "a silicate emitting inner nlr of low optical depth , on the other hand , obviously has to be combined with obscuring structures that are plausibly related to the hot continuum in our decompositions .",
    "finally , future high spatial resolution mid - infrared studies through 8m - class diffraction limited imaging , and interferometry with improved sensitivity will be essential to remove remaining ambiguities between the contributions of torus and nlr to the silicate emission .    finally ,",
    "while the match between our models and the source spectra is in general good , we find for some sources small deviations between the modeled and observed @xmath310 @xmath2 m silicate peak position .",
    "most clearly this can be seen in the fit of pg1626 + 554 , where the observed silicate emission peaks somewhat redward from the modeled 9.7 @xmath2 m silicate peak .",
    "this has already been reported earlier ( e.g. , @xcite ) and may be explained by our physical assumptions , such as the grain size distribution and the exact chemistry of the silicate grains .",
    "scenarios based on the unified model suggest that silicate emission in agn arises mainly from the illuminated faces of the clouds in the torus at temperatures near sublimation .",
    "however , detections of silicate emission in type 2 qsos , and the estimated cool dust temperatures , argue for an origin in a more extended region . to investigate this issue ,",
    "we have presented the -irs spectra of 23 qsos .",
    "we have matched physically - based models to the mid - infrared spectra and found that the silicate emission observed in these objects can be reproduced by emission from clouds , outside the central torus .",
    "this extended silicate - emitting region is possibly associated with the innermost nlr region or the intermediate dusty region proposed by @xcite .",
    "the dust cloud distances found here scale with the agn luminosity as @xmath113 pc , with the bolometric luminosity @xmath17 given in units of @xmath18 @xmath94 .",
    "we have estimated the median distance of the dust cloud responsible for the silicate emission to be 40 pc , while for individual sources distances up to 260 pc are possible .",
    "the smallest cloud distance is 9 pc for pg 0050 + 124 .",
    "the calculated covering factors for the dust clouds have a median of 0.16 and are in agreement with an nlr origin of the silicate emission .",
    "our models do not exclude the possibility of a torus contribution to the observed silicate emission , but rather emphasize the good agreement and perhaps the necessity of a larger - scale contribution to this emission . finally , future high spatial resolution infrared observations and further crosschecks including the comparison to type 1/2 ratios as well as distributions and individual values for the obscuring columns in x - rays and the near infrared are needed to resolve the remaining ambiguities between torus and nlr emission .",
