    "it is a well - known fact that the resonant transition @xmath1 exceeds the non - resonant short - distance process @xmath0 by about two orders of magnitude , even when considering the rate fully integrated over the dilepton invariant mass .",
    "since the process is inclusive over the hadronic final states , this is sometimes interpreted as a particularly striking failure of global parton - hadron duality , which says that the sum over the hadronic final states , including resonances , should be well approximated by a quark - level calculation @xcite .",
    "the origin of the problem is apparently rooted in the fact that the process @xmath0 contains a penguin contribution with a charm - quark loop , which has only a small effect on the partonic calculation but leads to a large resonant enhancement in the real world .",
    "charm - quark loops are relevant in other contexts as well , such as in the calculation of the charm production cross section in @xmath11 annihilation from the imaginary part of a current correlator , and in the calculation of penguin amplitudes in non - leptonic @xmath2 decays in the qcd factorization framework @xcite",
    ". should one expect large violations of global parton - hadron duality due to charmonium resonances in these cases as well ?",
    "the purpose of this note is to explain the origin of the resonance dominance in @xmath0 decays .",
    "we then investigate the differences between this process , where duality should not be expected to hold , and non - leptonic @xmath2 decays , where we demonstrate that it holds in the heavy - quark limit .",
    "the contributions of charmonium states to the different observables studied in this note are described in terms of resonance contributions to a correlation function @xmath12 .",
    "the question of when large deviations from quark - hadron duality arise is tightly linked to how this function enters the formulae for the various decay rates .",
    "after a brief review of some basic facts about @xmath13 decays , we study the correlator of two charm - quark currents using the operator product expansion ( ope ) as well as a hadronic picture in terms of coulomb resonance states .",
    "we then construct a toy model , which elucidates important features of the correlator and their relation to violations of quark - hadron duality .",
    "returning to the case of @xmath13 decays , we derive numerical estimates explaining the observed large violation of duality in a semi - quantitative way .",
    "finally , we consider the question of duality violations in charm - loop penguin contributions to exclusive hadronic decays such as @xmath3 .",
    "our discussion in this note focuses on the inclusive leptonic process @xmath0 , for which duality violations in the charm resonance region are particularly pronounced and experimentally well studied .",
    "we emphasize that an analogous discussion holds for the related radiative process @xmath14 , for which the resonant transition @xmath15 followed by @xmath16 also exceeds the total inclusive short - distance contribution .",
    "the total inclusive branching fraction for the process @xmath0 may be written as  @xcite @xmath17 where we have neglected the contribution from the magnetic dipole operator @xmath18 , which is immaterial to our discussion .",

    "the leading contributions to the decay rate are a large logarithmic term @xmath27 in @xmath28 from the ultraviolet contribution to the charm - penguin amplitude ( high - energy scales between @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) and the top - quark contributions to @xmath28 and @xmath31 . since @xmath32 and @xmath22 is of order 1 ,",
    "we conclude that the low - energy contribution ( scales at or below @xmath29 ) of the charm penguin is subleading .",

    "on the other hand , the branching fraction for @xmath15 reads ( with @xmath36 ) @xmath37 this falls short of the experimental value @xmath38 @xcite , since the inclusive @xmath39 production rate is probably dominated by colour - octet production @xcite .",
    "phenomenologically , the experimental rate may be accounted for by introducing a factor @xmath40 and replacing @xmath41 multiplying the experimental value with the leptonic branching fraction @xmath42 , we obtain the resonance contribution @xmath43 and thus @xmath44 this estimate is only slightly modified by contributions from the higher charmonium resonances . since the denominator includes the partonic charm - loop contribution , we conclude that the quark - level calculation of the _ total _ branching fraction yields a result that is far smaller than the contributions from the charmonium resonances alone , indicating a gross failure of global quark - hadron duality .    in order to include the resonance contributions in a phenomenological description of the global features of the @xmath0 spectrum , krger and sehgal ( ks ) have suggested to relate the charm - penguin loop to the hadronic @xmath4 vacuum polarization function @xmath12 using a dispersion relation @xcite .",
    "this assumes that qcd interactions between the charm loop and the remaining quarks in the process can be neglected . on the other hand",
    ", the ks model offers the possibility to take resonances and other hadronic contributions related to the charm loop into account .",
    "employing the dispersion relation gives the correct scheme dependence of the loop function and avoids a double counting of partonic and hadronic degrees of freedom .",

    "[ t]@xmath48 [ b]@xmath49 $ ]    from the preceding discussion it is clear that important information on the hadronic dynamics of @xmath0 is contained in the vacuum polarization function , which we briefly review in the following section .",
    "in discussing the validity of a perturbative quark - level computation of the penguin amplitude , the concept of quark - hadron duality is crucial . we will therefore recall basic aspects of duality for the correlator of two vector currents",
    "this is a particularly simple situation , but it is also relevant for the penguin amplitude in the approximation where further gluon attachments to the charm loop are neglected .    the correlator is defined by @xmath50 where @xmath51 for the charm quark , and @xmath52 for the case of light quarks .",
    "the scalar function @xmath12 obeys the dispersion relation @xmath53 which is defined in the euclidean domain @xmath54 and may be analytically continued to the time - like region @xmath55 .",
    "the expression on the left - hand side of ( [ disprel ] ) can be computed in qcd by means of an ope as a power series in @xmath56 , with the coefficient of each term given as an expansion in the strong coupling @xmath57 .",
    "we shall denote this quark - level ( ope ) result for @xmath12 as @xmath58 .",
    "to lowest order in the ope , and omitting @xmath59 corrections , the correlator is given by @xmath60 with @xmath61 the quark mass and @xmath62 the number of colours .",

    "( [ disprel ] ) is valid for the exact , hadronic correlator @xmath65 .",

    "@xmath68 where @xmath69 is the charm - quark charge . using ( [ disprel ] ) , @xmath65 may then , in principle , be obtained from experimental data .    to any finite order in @xmath57 and @xmath56 , the ope quantity @xmath58 is expected to approximate the true function @xmath65 in the sense of an asymptotic expansion . for @xmath54 , with sufficiently large @xmath70 , the difference between @xmath71 and @xmath66",
    "should then be systematically reduced with the inclusion of more terms in the ope , up to a residual uncertainty , which is expected to be exponentially suppressed as @xmath72 with an @xmath73 constant @xmath74 . for @xmath55 the deviation of the smooth function @xmath58 from @xmath65 might also involve oscillatory terms in @xmath47 .",
    "the approximation of @xmath66 by @xmath71 will then in general not work point by point , but only if @xmath55 is large enough or @xmath75 is averaged over a sufficiently wide range in @xmath47 @xcite . the correspondence between @xmath71 and @xmath66 point by point in @xmath47 is referred to as local quark - hadron duality , the correspondence of averages as global quark - hadron duality",
    ". an illuminating discussion of these concepts can be found in @xcite .",
    "the concept of duality is of particular importance for light - quark correlators , where the resonance region is always non - perturbative . for massive quarks",
    ", we may also consider the opposite limit , where not only @xmath76 , but also the binding energy of the quarkonium resonances is much larger than the strong - interaction scale .",
    "this limit is referred to as `` coulombic '' , since the dominant binding force is then the colour - coulomb force .",
    "although charmonium is not a coulomb bound state , it is instructive to discuss the coulombic limit of the charm - quark vector - current correlator in the present context . some of the results of this section will also be used in the numerical estimates below .    near @xmath77 the spectral function @xmath78 receives prominent contributions from a series of @xmath4 resonances ( and other hadronic states with open charm ) , which can not be captured by a fixed - order perturbative expansion .",
    "the exchange of coulomb gluons gives rise to corrections of order @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the velocity of the heavy quarks @xcite . in the threshold region",
    "@xmath81 the entire ladder of coulomb gluons needs to be resummed in order to account for the detailed behaviour of @xmath12 .",
    "when this is done , one finds for the correlator after @xmath82 subtractions @xcite @xmath83 , \\ ] ] with @xmath84 here @xmath85 denotes the digamma function , and @xmath86 . expression ( [ picoul ] ) , valid for @xmath87 , contains poles for positive integer values @xmath88 , which correspond to the charmonium binding energies @xmath89 in the colour - coulomb potential .",
    "the residues of these poles determine the decay constants @xmath90 of the s - wave bound states at energy @xmath91 .",
    "the pole part of ( [ picoul ] ) is thus equivalent to @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the decay constant @xmath95 of the ground state is given in terms of the wave function at the origin by @xmath96    the validity of local vs.  global parton - hadron duality in the coulombic limit is related to the issue of perturbative resummation .",
    "when sufficiently wide and smooth averages of @xmath75 or @xmath97 over the resonance region are taken , global duality holds in the sense that these quantities are well approximated by fixed - order perturbative and ope computations without any need to sum the coulomb ladders .",
    "in addition , in the coulombic limit one may expect that local duality holds as well , since the physics of the threshold region is perturbative .",
    "it is evident that a local correspondence of @xmath98 and @xmath99 requires the perturbative resummation of coulomb gluons discussed above .",
    "however , even in the ultra - heavy - quark limit there is a non - perturbative contribution from the strong - interaction scale to the charmonium binding energy @xcite .",
    "thus , for local duality to hold this contribution must be small compared to the width of the resonance .",
    "the widths of the resonances are not present in ( [ picoul ] ) and ( [ pipole ] ) , since in the coulombic limit they are of higher order in small coupling constants .",
    "a further resummation is required that replaces @xmath100 in the denominator of ( [ pipole ] ) .",
    "concentrating on @xmath101 , the @xmath39 resonance can decay via the strong interaction into a three - gluon final state or into a fermion pair ( @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath48 ) through a virtual photon .",
    "the total decay rate of the ground state is then given by @xmath106 where @xmath107 this expression requires only that the charm - quark mass is large compared to the strong - interaction scale . in the coulombic limit , one may further use the result ( [ fpsipsi ] ) for @xmath95 . note that the second term in ( [ gammapsi ] ) constitutes a sizable fraction of about 20% of the total rate , despite the electromagnetic origin of this contribution .",
    "before we return to a discussion of @xmath0 decays , we shall consider a toy model in which the hadronic part of the amplitude is exactly the current correlator discussed above , such that the role of resonances and quark - hadron duality is exhibited in a particularly transparent way . to this end , let us hypothetically assume the existence of two `` leptons '' , @xmath108 with a large mass @xmath109 and @xmath110 with mass @xmath111 , and the effective weak hamiltonian @xmath112 .\\ ] ] since we are interested in the qcd dynamics of the decay , the flavour aspects of the model are unimportant for our discussion .",
    "all particles are assumed to have standard strong and electromagnetic interactions .",
    "then @xmath113 gives rise to a loop - induced process @xmath114 via charm- and top - quark penguin diagrams with a gim - like cancellation between them .",
    "the corresponding decay amplitude reads @xmath115 here @xmath116 is given as the difference between the charm and top contributions .",
    "we take @xmath117 , and thus @xmath118 comes only from the charm sector .",
    "the correlator @xmath12 fulfills the dispersion relation ( [ disprel ] ) , where @xmath119 is fixed by our model and can be computed in perturbation theory . to",
    "leading order one finds @xmath120 the form of ( [ al12ee ] ) for the amplitude holds to lowest order in @xmath121 and @xmath122 , but to all orders in the strong coupling .",
    "in fact , since the quark loops have no qcd interactions with the other , purely leptonic parts of the amplitude , the quantity @xmath97 in ( [ al12ee ] ) can be considered as the exact hadronic correlator in qcd . from ( [ al12ee ] )",
    "we obtain the differential decay rate ( with @xmath123 ) @xmath124    we shall now investigate to what extent the hadronic function @xmath12 in ( [ gaml12ee ] ) may be approximated by a quark - level calculation .",
    "this is clearly the case for values of @xmath47 at which local duality is a reasonable approximation , that is if @xmath125 is well above the narrow - resonance region , or if @xmath126 lies sufficiently far below the charmonium threshold ( we will make the latter statement more precise at the end of this section ) .",
    "however , in a region of @xmath47 where prominent resonances exist , local duality is certainly badly violated .",
    "then @xmath127 and also @xmath128 can not be computed locally in the ope approach . for @xmath128 the agreement of the full hadronic correlator with the quark - level calculation can be improved by integrating with a smooth weight function over a sufficiently large interval in @xmath47 ( global duality ) . however , in ( [ gaml12ee ] ) the correlator is _ squared _ before the @xmath47-integral can be performed to obtain the total rate for @xmath114 . as a consequence ,",
    "the impact of sharp resonances is not averaged out even for the integrated rate .",
    "this is in fact our main point : the concept of global parton - hadron duality should not be expected to apply to averages of the quantity @xmath127 .    to make this point clearer",
    ", we consider the contribution of a single @xmath39 resonance to @xmath12 , omitting for the moment other resonances and non - resonant terms .",
    "the correlator then has the approximate form @xmath129 where @xmath95 , @xmath130 , and @xmath131 denote the decay constant , mass , and total width of the resonance .",
    "is calculated within qcd , then strictly speaking @xmath131 excludes the electromagnetic contribution in ( [ gammapsi ] ) to the total decay width . in the following , it will be useful to consider @xmath131 as an adjustable parameter .",
    "for instance , we might consider a variant of the model , in which @xmath12 is the correlator of a current with different quark flavours , so that the qcd contribution to the width of the resonance is exactly zero . in this case",
    "@xmath131 is proportional to the arbitrary coupling constant of a hypothetical interaction by which the resonance decays to @xmath11 . ]",
    "it follows that @xmath132 while @xmath133 it is important to note that in the small - width limit @xmath127 is more singular than @xmath128 .",
    "concentrating first on the absorptive part of the correlator , we note that it can deviate by a large factor from the partonic result . for instance , on resonance we have @xmath134 at the @xmath39 resonance , for which @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137gev , @xmath138 corresponding to a huge violation of local duality .",
    "this behaviour has both a parametric and a numerical origin , as can be seen from ( [ psiwidths ] ) , which gives , using @xmath139 , @xmath140 in reasonable agreement with the experimental result ( [ f2mgamnum ] ) . in spite of this , the resonance contribution to the integral @xmath141 is parametrically small compared to the integral over the non - resonant contribution , which is of order @xmath142 when @xmath143 is large .",
    "this is consistent with global duality .",
    "in fact , the integral over the partonic expression for @xmath128 is dual to the integral over the hadronic expression including the contribution from the resonances .",
    "this property is used in the determination of the charm - quark mass from qcd sum rules @xcite , as well as in the determination of @xmath57 from @xmath144 decays @xcite , in which case it is applied to light - quark resonances .",
    "we now contrast this to the situation for the square of the correlator .",
    "for the narrow @xmath39 resonance , using ( [ pi2im ] ) and @xmath145 we obtain for the resonance contribution to the integral @xmath146 this should be compared with the non - resonant contribution , which remains of order @xmath142 .",
    "the appearance of the factor @xmath147 with the width in the denominator allows the resonance contribution to be arbitrarily large . since expression ( [ al12ee ] ) is exact in qcd , it is clear that global duality can not possibly hold in this case and may be violated by an arbitrarily large amount ( to the extent that we can adjust the resonance width at will ) . substituting the resonance expression for @xmath127 into ( [ gaml12ee ] )",
    ", we find @xmath148 where ( with @xmath149 ) @xmath150 this reproduces the result for the rate of the decay chain @xmath151 in the narrow - width approximation .",
    "the ratio @xmath152 of the resonance rate to the non - resonant partonic rate can now be estimated as follows .",
    "first , the partonic rate is obtained from ( [ gaml12ee ] ) using the partonic expression for @xmath12 . in the one - loop approximation",
    "we find @xmath153     \\ln\\frac{1+\\sqrt{1-x}}{1-\\sqrt{1-x } } - i\\pi \\,;~ & x<1 \\ , ,     \\end{array }     \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath154 .",
    "for typical values of the parameters ( e.g.  @xmath155gev , @xmath156gev , @xmath157gev ) the minimum of @xmath158 is located at @xmath159 , while its maximum occurs at @xmath160 . at these values of @xmath47 @xmath161 with @xmath162 at @xmath159 and @xmath163 at @xmath160 . the total rate is well represented by treating @xmath158 as constant with an intermediate value of @xmath164 .",
    "it can then be estimated to be @xmath165 the resonant contribution is @xmath166 we thus find for their ratio @xmath167 in this example the first factor is about 55 , @xmath168 , and the last factor has been given in ( [ f2mgamnum ] ) .",
    "we observe that the moderate suppression of the channel @xmath169 by @xmath170 is overcompensated by the enhancement factor @xmath171 , whose origin we have discussed above in the context of ( [ pi2im ] ) .",
    "since the latter factor is very large because of the narrow width of the @xmath39 resonance , we have @xmath172 .",
    "as anticipated , this result excludes the applicability of the quark - hadron duality hypothesis .",
    "the deeper origin for the absence of global duality can be seen in the fact that there is no ope for the total rate of @xmath114 decay .",
    "constructing the rate as the absorptive part of the @xmath173 forward - scattering amplitude , @xmath174 we would need contributions with an @xmath11 loop , coupled to charm- and top - quarks by photons , and we would have to require that the cut passes through this loop in order to obtain the rate for @xmath114 ( see the first graph in figure  [ fig : l1l2ee ] ) .",
    "this does not correspond to an ope of ( [ imhh ] ) , which would imply a sum over all cuts , not just a restricted set . in this way @xmath175",
    "is seen not to be a truly inclusive quantity , for which global duality would be expected to hold . rather , the selection of a final state with an @xmath11 pair represents a more `` exclusive '' choice , even for the integrated @xmath114 rate , which leads to an integral over @xmath127 .",
    "the situation encountered here is similar to that for the radiative decay @xmath14 .",
    "as emphasized in @xcite , in this case contributions to the decay rate for which the photon is not part of the local operators in the effective weak hamiltonian can not be obtained from an ope .",
    "they correspond to a subset of cuts analogous to those in figure  [ fig : l1l2ee ] .    on the other hand ,",
    "a very different situation occurs for the inclusive hadronic decay @xmath176 ( see the second graph in figure  [ fig : l1l2ee ] ) . in that case",
    "no restriction is placed on the cuts , and an ope can be applied to ( [ imhh ] ) .",
    "similarly to the rate of hadronic @xmath144 decay @xcite , the decay rate is given by a weighted integral over the imaginary parts of the vector - current ( @xmath97 ) and axial - vector current correlators ( @xmath177 ) , @xmath178 , \\ ] ] and global duality works in the same way as for the charm contribution to the @xmath179 cross section .",
    "finally , we briefly return to the low-@xmath47 region in @xmath180 decays mentioned after ( [ gaml12ee ] ) . here",
    "a quark - level calculation is justified if @xmath47 is sufficiently below the @xmath39 resonance .",
    "we estimate @xmath181 , the maximum value of @xmath47 , up to which a quark - level calculation of @xmath12 can be trusted . for @xmath47 close to zero the quark picture",
    "is reliable , and the @xmath39-resonance contribution is only a small part in a hadronic representation of @xmath97 .",
    "as @xmath47 gets close to @xmath182 , the resonance contribution dominates the correlator while the partonic result for @xmath97 is too small .",
    "therefore , as an estimate for @xmath181 we use the point in @xmath47 where the one - loop partonic result equals the @xmath39-resonance contribution to @xmath183 .",
    "using @xmath184_\\psi=(f^2_\\psi / m^2_\\psi)\\ , q^2/(m^2_\\psi - q^2)$ ] and the partonic expression in ( [ pipart ] ) close to threshold @xmath185 , we obtain @xmath186 . here",
    "we have considered the limit @xmath187 in order to obtain a simple analytic expression .",
    "we then have @xmath188 for the one - loop result , @xmath189 for the @xmath39-resonance contribution , and @xmath190 for the full hadronic expression in the ks representation .",
    "since @xmath183 is subdominant in comparison to @xmath119 , given in ( [ pi0 ] ) , the quark - level estimate of @xmath191 is still rather accurate .",
    "a similar discussion applies to @xmath192 .",
    "we now return to the discussion of @xmath0 , following the analysis of the toy model considered in the previous section .",
    "the branching fraction for the decay chain @xmath1 is obtained by multiplying ( [ bspsi ] ) with @xmath193 where the total rate @xmath131 is given in ( [ gammapsi ] ) . replacing @xmath194 in ( [ bspsi ] ) and using ( [ bsee ] )",
    ", we then have for the ratio of the resonant and the partonic rate @xmath195 the first factor is about 23 numerically .",
    "the first two factors give approximately 0.16 .",
    "the large enhancement from @xmath196 overcomes the suppression @xmath197 , and we recover @xmath198 .",
    "this explains the size of @xmath152 already quoted in ( [ bspsiee ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to consider the heavy - quark limit @xmath29 , @xmath199 with @xmath200 fixed , where the @xmath39 resonance is asymptotically a coulombic bound state .",
    "if we still assume @xmath201 , then ( [ fpsipsi ] ) and ( [ psiwidths ] ) imply @xmath202 we see that formally @xmath203 in the heavy - quark limit .",
    "however , the expression ( [ rpsio1 ] ) contains a large enhancement from numerical factors and from the running of @xmath57 between the momentum scale of the charmonium bound state , entering @xmath95 , and the scale @xmath130 , which is relevant for @xmath131 .",
    "using @xmath204 , the asymptotic formula ( [ rpsio1 ] ) gives @xmath205 and thus reproduces the bulk of the resonance enhancement .",
    "in the heavy - quark limit a resummation of coulomb ladders would automatically account for the large @xmath39-resonance contribution in the total rate of @xmath0 . upon dyson resummation of finite - width effects into the resonance propagator ,",

    "corrections of the penguin type as shown in figure  [ fig : cpeng ] enter the perturbatively calculable hard - scattering kernels for @xmath216 decay amplitudes in qcd factorization .",
    "such penguin contributions are consistently included in the factorization formula at next - to - leading order in perturbation theory , and at leading order in the heavy - quark limit @xcite .",
    "nonperturbative strong interactions of the intermediate quarks and gluons do exist , but they are suppressed by powers of @xmath217 with respect to the leading , factorizable amplitudes . in the following",
    "we shall discuss how the suppression comes about in the penguin contributions with a charm - quark or a light - quark loop .",
    "of particular interest is the case of the charm penguin , where the validity of the usual factorization formula has been questioned in the literature @xcite .    in order to discuss the physics of penguin - type matrix elements with charm - loop contractions , it is instructive to consider first the case of electromagnetic penguins ( figure  [ fig : cpeng ] with the gluon replaced by a photon ) .",
    "these are rather similar to the more prominent gluonic penguins , but the qcd dynamics is simpler in this case .",
    "the electromagnetic penguin matrix element contributes at @xmath218 to the factorization coefficient @xmath219 ( @xmath220 , @xmath74 ) in the transition operator for @xmath3 decays , which contains the term @xcite @xmath221 the penguin contraction of the dominant current - current operators @xmath222 gives a correction , included in @xmath219 , which reads @xmath223 , \\ ] ] where @xmath224 refers to the quark @xmath220 , @xmath74 inside the loop , and @xmath225 with @xmath226       \\nonumber\\\\     & = & - \\frac{2}{3}\\ln s + \\frac{8\\pi^2}{3 }      \\left [ \\pi_q(\\bar x m^2_b ) - \\pi_q(0 ) \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the penguin function , which involves a convolution of a perturbative hard - scattering kernel with the leading - twist pion distribution amplitude @xmath227 @xcite .",
    "( [ dela10 ] ) represents the leading contribution of the electromagnetic penguin to the hard - scattering amplitude in qcd factorization , evaluated at lowest order in perturbation theory .",
    "the function @xmath228 is an @xmath73 quantity , and @xmath229 .",
    "note the presence in the one - loop kernel @xmath230 of the vector - current correlator discussed in ( [ piquark ] ) .",
    "indeed , the expression in square parentheses in ( [ dela10 ] ) can be rewritten as a term proportional to the convolution of the unsubtracted correlator @xmath231 with the pion distribution amplitude plus an additive correction of 2/3 , which arises from the fact that in the ndr scheme with anticommuting @xmath232 , which we have adopted in @xcite , the four - dimensional fierz identities are violated .",
    "consider now the effect of a @xmath4 resonance in the case of the charm - loop contribution .",
    "this corresponds to the diagram in figure  [ fig : cpeng ] ( with photon exchange ) , but where the @xmath4 loop is replaced by a @xmath39 resonance propagator .",
    "assuming factorization at the weak vertex , the contribution of the intermediate resonance to the decay amplitude may be evaluated in a straightforward way .",
    "for the equivalent of the function @xmath230 one finds , using the narrow - width approximation , @xmath233 where @xmath234 .",
    "this may be integrated with the pion distribution amplitude @xmath227 according to ( [ gpis ] ) . employing the asymptotic form",
    "@xmath235 one obtains ( for @xmath236 ) @xmath237 .\\ ] ] this contribution has to be considered as part of a hadronic representation of the hard - scattering amplitude @xmath238 .",
    "it is suppressed in the heavy - quark limit .",
    "consequently the existence of the resonance can not alter substantially the quark - level result for @xmath238 , neither parametrically nor numerically . for @xmath239 , @xmath136 .",
    "the partonic evaluation of the charm - loop contribution results in @xmath240 for @xmath241 , and in @xmath242 for the smaller charm - mass value @xmath243 .",
    "this should be compared to the result obtained from the hadronic representation of @xmath12 in the ks model @xcite giving @xmath244 and @xmath245 for the two charm - mass values , respectively .",
    "thus , within uncertainties ( perturbative , parametric , power corrections ) , the partonic and the hadronic ( ks ) results agree reasonably well .",
    "note that the resonance contributions are more important for the imaginary part of @xmath246 than for its real part .",
    "this is consistent with the behaviour of moment sum rules to determine the charm - quark mass , which are dominated by the charmonium resonances even for low moment order @xcite .",
    "while the above numbers are only estimates for the purpose of illustration , the analysis in @xcite also indicates that global quark - hadron duality works well for @xmath12 between @xmath159 and @xmath247 . ] more specifically , in the coulombic approximation the resonance contributes only at third order in @xmath57 , i.e.  @xmath248 , which follows from ( [ fpsipsi ] ) and ( [ gpipsi ] ) . in the opposite limit , where the charm quark is treated as a light quark",
    ", we obtain instead @xmath249 .",
    "this demonstrates that the contribution of a light resonance is suppressed by two powers of @xmath217 .",
    "note also that the imaginary part related to a light resonance has a suppression by four powers of @xmath217 due to the additional endpoint suppression from the pion distribution amplitude in ( [ gpipsi ] ) .",
    "an important difference between the cases @xmath0 and @xmath3 results from the nature of the smearing procedure .",
    "in the first case the correlator is first squared and then integrated over phase - space , see ( [ intpisq ] ) . in the second case the contribution to the decay _",
    "amplitude _ is given by an integral of a correlator with the pion distribution amplitude .",
    "this integral , for which duality holds , is then squared when one computes the decay rate .",
    "note that the nature of the correlator itself is more complicated in the latter case . instead of a correlation function of currents ,",
    "the relevant correlator is the @xmath250 matrix element of the time - ordered product of a linear combination of the current - current operators @xmath251 in the effective weak hamiltonian with standard model interactions converting the @xmath4 pair into light quarks and gluons .",
    "the assumption of factorization of the @xmath4 loop from the remaining quarks in the diagram is , of course , an idealization .",
    "however , gluon exchange between the charm loop and the @xmath252 and @xmath48 quarks does not invalidate our arguments .",
    "the most dangerous resonance contributions arise in the channel where the @xmath4 loop is in a colour - singlet state .",
    "single - gluon exchange graphs are therefore less sensitive to such effects . in the case of the qcd penguin contribution the leading term in the qcd factorization approach",
    "contains the @xmath4 pair in a colour - octet state , and hence it is even less affected by resonance effects than the electroweak penguin contribution .",
    "when @xmath253 is assumed , soft gluon exchange between the charm loop and the @xmath252 and @xmath48 quarks ( hadronically , the remnant of the decaying @xmath2 meson ) is expected to provide @xmath73 modifications in the resonance region , but it does not alter the power counting .",
    "since the contribution from the resonance region is small , as shown above , the factorization result at leading power in the heavy - quark expansion remains unaffected .",
    "the conclusion that the resonance contribution to the charm - penguin diagrams for exclusive hadronic @xmath2 decays into two light mesons is parametrically suppressed in the heavy - quark limit , irrespective of whether the charm quark is treated as being heavy or light , is in agreement with the general arguments on the suppression of the resonance or threshold region of @xmath254 loops given in @xcite .",
    "it disagrees with @xcite however , whose authors claim that qcd factorization fails for charm penguins even at leading power in the heavy - quark limit .",
    "we now explain why this claim is incorrect .",
    "the argument of @xcite is based on the estimate @xmath255 where @xmath256 is the non - perturbative contribution from the charm - quark penguins , @xmath80 is the small charm - quark velocity , and @xmath257 denotes some function of the ratio of heavy - quark masses .",
    "we find that there is an important factor missing on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : accbarscet ] ) .",
    "the matching described in the appendix of @xcite applies to the threshold region and is therefore done for a _ fixed value _ of @xmath258 , the gluon virtuality in figure  [ fig : cpeng ] . the effective amplitude obtained in this way",
    "must then be integrated over the threshold region of size @xmath259 , which implies an integral of the form ( with @xmath260 ) @xmath261 where @xmath262 is the coefficient function of the @xmath4 production operator defined in @xcite . outside the threshold region",
    "the standard qcd factorization formulae apply and the factorization of charm loops is undisputed . matching the amplitude gives @xmath263 , and from the restricted integral in ( [ eq : ciprodint ] ) we obtain a suppression factor of order @xmath264 , by which the estimate in ( [ eq : accbarscet ] ) should be multiplied to give @xmath265 this can easily be checked explicitly for the diagram in figure  [ fig : cpeng ] .",
    "one may also note from ( [ gpipsi ] ) that the scaling of @xmath266 in the non - relativistic limit is of the same form as ( [ eq : accbarcorrect ] ) .",
    "the reason for the omission in @xcite of the last factor in ( [ eq : accbarcorrect ] ) can be traced to the fact that the authors incorrectly implement the restriction to the threshold region by assuming @xmath267 and so miss the suppression from the small size of this region .",
    "thus , contrary to a statement in their paper , the `` phase - space suppression factors '' discussed in @xcite are not included in ( [ eq : accbarscet ] ) .",
    "the analogy with inclusive quarkonium production mentioned in @xcite is misleading , since in this case factorization applies to the cross section , which contains the phase - space @xmath268-function in its definition , while here factorization is applied to an amplitude for fixed kinematics , which contains no @xmath268-function . the last factor in ( [ eq : accbarcorrect ] )",
    "suppresses non - perturbative effects in the charm - penguin contribution to the amplitude . following @xcite and taking @xmath269 , the additional factor",
    "is readily seen to give a power suppression , specifically @xmath270 .",
    "if , on the other hand , we adopt the power counting @xmath271 , then the non - relativistic scales can be treated in perturbation theory , and the uncalculable non - perturbative effects are again power suppressed @xcite .",
    "we hope that this discussion clarifies that non - perturbative effects in the threshold region in charm - penguin diagrams are power suppressed in the heavy - quark limit and hence do not spoil qcd factorization .",
    "we have explained the origin of the well - known fact that the integrated @xmath0 branching fraction is dominated by resonance contributions from narrow charmonium states , such as @xmath1 , which exceed the non - resonant charm - loop contribution by two orders of magnitude .",
    "our arguments , which are based on well - established theoretical tools , show that quark - hadron duality can not be expected to hold for these decays . on the other hand",
    ", we have shown that corresponding resonance effects lead to highly suppressed contributions to charm - penguin amplitudes in two - body hadronic @xmath2 decays of the type @xmath3 , which do not invalidate the standard picture of qcd factorization .",
    "the contributions of charmonium states to the different observables studied in this note are described in terms of resonance contributions to a correlation function @xmath12 .",
    "the question of when large deviations from quark - hadron duality arise is tightly linked to how this correlator enters the formulae for the various decay rates . in fully inclusive quantities such as the @xmath4 contribution to the @xmath179 cross section ,",
    "the imaginary part of a current - current correlator is integrated over phase space , and duality holds in the sense of @xcite .",
    "a similar situation is realized in inclusive semileptonic or hadronic @xmath2-meson decays , not discussed here .",
    "the inclusive decay rates are given in terms of forward @xmath2-meson matrix elements of the imaginary parts of correlators of two effective weak hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "in more complicated cases such as the penguin contributions to exclusive hadronic decays @xmath216 in the heavy - quark limit , the charm - penguin contributions to the decay amplitudes are given in terms of hadronic matrix elements of time - ordered products of current - current operators from the effective weak hamiltonian with standard model lagrangian insertions , convoluted with the pion distribution amplitude . even though the qcd dynamics is considerably more complicated in this case , the resonance physics is similar , and duality still holds in a global sense , that the integrated ( smeared ) correlation functions calculated in a partonic picture approximate the true hadronic correlation functions in the heavy - quark limit .",
    "the charm - resonance contributions to @xmath0 decays , on the other hand , are expressed in terms of a phase - space integral over the absolute _ square _ of a correlator .",
    "we have shown that due to the fact that the widths of the lowest - lying charmonium states are very narrow , this integral violates the duality hypothesis by an amount that becomes arbitrarily large in the limit @xmath272 .",
    "our main conclusions are derived with the example of a toy model , which keeps the essential features of the resonance physics while simplifying other aspects of the decay processes .",
    "our discussion in this note has concentrated on the inclusive leptonic process @xmath0 , for which duality violations in the charm resonance region are particularly pronounced and experimentally well studied .",
    "an analogous discussion applies to the related radiative process @xmath14 .",
