    "there is a long history of compiling catalogs of nearby galaxy clusters by using optical telescopes @xcite .",
    "the development of focusing x - ray telescopes and the early discovery of x - rays from clusters of galaxies @xcite provided another sensitive method for finding clusters of galaxies . a number of x - ray catalogues now exist for the brightest clusters .",
    "most of the nearby clusters are known from flux - limited surveys that cover a large fraction of the sky from rosat and einstein down to @xmath8 ( reflex , @xcite ; bcs , @xcite ; emss , @xcite ) .",
    "these surveys have discovered 100 - 450 clusters .",
    "deeper surveys that extend to @xmath9 and therefore probe a larger range of redshifts have found 60 - 200 clusters serendipitously ( 160 square deg .",
    ", @xcite ; 400 square deg .",
    "@xcite ; rosat nep , @xcite , @xcite ; warps , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "xmm - newton surveys have found 19 clusters serendipitously @xcite and 12 clusters in the large scale structure survey @xcite down to deeper flux levels .",
    "the slope of the log n - log s distribution for clusters is close to -1 down to a flux limit of @xmath10 which means that a wide survey with short exposures will approximately detect the same number of clusters as a narrow survey with longer exposures for the same total exposure time .",
    "thus the total number of clusters is simply proportional to the product of a telescope s etendue ( effective area times field of view ) times the total survey exposure time divided by the minimum number of photons that one can reliably use to identify a cluster unambiguously . a large number of the previous surveys used rosat which has an area of 200 @xmath11 and a field of view of 3 square degrees .",
    "the fields of view of chandra ( 0.1 square degrees ) and xmm - newton ( 0.2 square degrees ) are not particularly high , but the effective area of chandra ( 400 @xmath11 at 1 kev ) and especially xmm - newton ( 2000 @xmath11 at 1 kev ) are high .",
    "xmm - newton , in particular , has an etendue comparable to rosat .",
    "one difficulty with using xmm - newton to perform cluster surveys compared to rosat is that the large area and smaller field of view will collect on average more distant groups of galaxies , with smaller angular size , because the survey will be deeper rather than wider for the same exposure time .",
    "the fact that the clusters have smaller angular size means that it is harder to determine the difference between a cluster or group and a point source . on the other hand , chandra has a exquisitely sharp point - spread function ( psf ) that distiguishes agn point sources from clusters at all redshifts across its entire field of view .",
    "therefore , by implementing an analysis method which combines the chandra psf with the xmm - newton throughput , we demonstrate that we can produce a large sensitive x - ray cluster survey .",
    "recently , a number of independent astronomical methods have converged on a standard cosmological model , which indicates the presence of a poorly understood dark energy component .",
    "an extensive search for new galaxy clusters will provide new constraints on cosmological models . in general , the abundance and distribution of clusters of galaxies in the universe provides precision and complementary cosmological constraints to other methods @xcite .",
    "in particular , the measurements are most sensitive to @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the normalization of the matter power spectrum on 8 mpc scales and @xmath14 is the matter density .",
    "a large enough sample at a range of redshifts can constrain @xmath15 , the equation of state parameter for dark energy ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the distribution of clusters as a function of mass and the spatial power spectrum constrains cosmological parameters as well .",
    "the content of this initial paper principally concerns the exposition of the new approach for detecting a large sample of x - ray clusters based on a combined analysis of the all useful data in the full chandra and xmm - newton archives .",
    "we have discovered a new unbiased sample of 462 clusters that reaches the most sensitive flux limit achieved to date (  @xmath9 ) .",
    "we summarize the cosmological implications of this new information with an initial limited approach that assumes the concordance model of the universe is correct and compares the measured log n - log s curve of the new x - ray cluster sample with what would be expected in a concordance universe",
    ". the limited scope of this approach precludes a full analysis of the consistency of these new data and the concordance model .",
    "we do confirm approximate consistency with the concordance model in two independent ways .",
    "first we show that the rapid deviation of the log n - log s curve for fluxes less than (  @xmath16 ) for a universe without evolution of the density of clusters is consistent with an expected exponential decrease in cluster density for clusters near z @xmath2 1 and beyond .",
    "this result approximately matches the expected density for clusters of mass range expected at a distance of z @xmath2 1 ( see figure 15 ) . secondly , assuming a concordance model , we compute the expected log n - log s curve and find approximate agreement with the newly measured log n - log s curve ( see figure 16 ) .",
    "the detailed explanation of these two comparisons assuming a concordance model appears later in this paper .",
    "a full analysis beyond approximate consistency with the concordance model is beyond the scope of this initial paper . in particular",
    ", we must improve estimates of several possible systematic errors including the volume of the surveyed region in three dimensions , the exact detection threshold near the flux limit , the re - calibration of the temperature , size , luminosity and mass relations of x - ray selected clusters .",
    "we present the log n - log s of the unbiased sample of 462 new clusters without redshift measurements because redshifts ( and thus luminosities ) are not needed for this initial simple analysis .",
    "future work will address the full cosmological implications of these measurements beyond just the log n - log s curve for clusters .",
    "x - ray observations that have both xmm - newton and chandra data for the same piece of the sky have the advantage that they can use both the chandra psf and the xmm - newton throughput . for example , finding three photons within one or two arcseconds of each other in a 5 ks chandra exposure can umambiguously identify an agn .",
    "the probability of background fluctuation or a diffuse source creating that situation is negligible .",
    "the number of photons required to determine a point source in xmm - newton is much higher .",
    "on the other hand , xmm - newton has @xmath175 times the effective area and twice the field of view of the chandra telescope .",
    "so over both missions lifetimes xmm - newton has collected 10 times as many photons as chandra from clusters .",
    "therefore , by simply using chandra data to find the positions of agns , we can subtract photons from the xmm - newton data and select clusters with as few as 10 to 15 photons .",
    "we therefore have a sensitivity several times higher than if we used xmm - newton data alone .",
    "it may be possible to use the full xmm - newton dataset after calibrating the agn contribution precisely .",
    "the major challenge is to learn how to combine and calibrate all the data and correct for the non - uniformity of the survey .",
    "new analysis techniques are required , since the exposures are very deep and contain many smaller clusters at high redshift .",
    "following we describe the basic data processing , image reconstruction , point source removal procedure , and source detection and selection methods .",
    "to start this project , we first scanned the xmm - newton archive for any fields that could potentially overlap with chandra fields for all data in either archive as of september 2006 . using these fields we can combine the advantages of the chandra psf and the xmm - newton throughput in the following method . a remarkably large fraction ( nearly half ) of the observations",
    "overlap with chandra observations in at least some part of their field of view .",
    "this project clearly benefits from the fact that x - ray observers tend to choose similar targets with both observatories .",
    "we downloaded 1201 xmm - newton fields that overlapped with the the 2706 chandra acis - s or acis - i fields .",
    "we excluded fields within 10 degrees of the galactic plane or within 5 degrees of the smc and lmc .",
    "we also included fields that have only chandra data , since although they will not benefit from the xmm - newton throughput they can be used to augment the survey with more data with high psf quality .",
    "the positions of the observations are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the survey contains approximately 122.2 square deg . of chandra - alone data with an average exposure of 44 ks and 41.2 square deg .",
    "of overlapping xmm - newton and chandra data with an equivalent chandra exposure of 166 ks .",
    "thus , the chandra - alone data contains about 44% of the cluster candidates and the overlapping survey will contain about 56% because of the relative effective etendues of each sub - survey .",
    "a total of 54 ms of chandra data and 7 ms of xmm - newton data were used .",
    "we used the chandra level 2 events and applied the standard destreak processing tool .",
    "we processed all the xmm - newton data using the sas pipeline .",
    "the chandra photon events were selected to have corrected energy ( pi ) between 0.5 and 7 kev , have no bad data quality flag , and have event pattern less than or equal to 4 .",
    "the xmm - newton photon events were selected to have corrected energy ( pi ) between 0.5 and 7 kev and an event grade of 0 , 3 , or 4 .",
    "background flares were removed from all the 3907 datasets by first binning the events in 100 second time bins .",
    "we then iteratively removed 100 second intervals which have the highest count rate until the signal squared ( proportional to the number of time bins ) divided by the noise ( proportional to the total counts ) was maximized .",
    "this procedure optimally removed the variable component of the background ( or a bright flaring agn ) .",
    "we also removed observations with effective exposures ( in ks ) divided by the count rate greater than 0.2 .",
    "this removed extremely short exposures that almost entirely contain background flares .",
    "we scanned the entire sky and identified all photons from any of the datasets that could have originated in a given grid cell of size 1 square degree .",
    "on average there are usually about 2 different observations from either telescope that overlap with a given field position . within each 1 square degree",
    "we only include cluster candidates in the catalog if they fall within the central 0.5 degree by 0.5 degree box , but we analyzed the entire set of photons in the box through the procedure we describe below .",
    "the 1 degree square regions were chosen , however , so that they overlapped by 0.5 degrees , leaving no residual binning artifacts .",
    "we only included events from the chandra data that were within 15 arcminutes of the center of the field of view .",
    "this was necessary because the size of the psf increases significantly at larger angles , but still a large fraction of the data were included .",
    "this angle cut also means that some acis - s data was included with acis - i pointed observations and some acis - i data were included with acis - s pointed observations . for some particularly deep observations with long exposures",
    ", we only included a randomly chosen set of @xmath18 photons and then scaled the measurements accordingly , since some of the algorithms we employ below have run times proportional to the number of photons squared .",
    "this was rare and only occurs for less than @xmath19 of the datasets .    for every arcminute of the sky",
    ", we computed the effective exposure times telescope area ( having units @xmath20 ) including the effects of telescope vignetting . to do this",
    ", we assume that the ratio of effective areas of the acis - s , epic - pn , and epic - mos were , respectively , 1.4 , 4.8 , and 1.6 times the acis - i area and then we scaled all results of the effective area exposure map to acis - i . in reality , the relative area depends on the area of the source , but the values we found were an empirically best averages over all sources and background . similarly , for the vignetting profile , we assumed a lorentzian profile of the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 is 15 arcminutes for xmm - newton and 25 arcminutes for chandra .",
    "this roughly matched the average energy dependence of the vignetting .",
    "we then removed xmm - newton photons and set the xmm - newton exposure - area to zero where there were no chandra data in either that location in the 1 arcminute exposure - area map or in the adjacent 4 squares in the 1 arcminute exposure - area map .",
    "this then conservatively removed any edge effects , and we are left with xmm - newton events only where there is a complete set of chandra events .",
    "a sample from the lynx field is shown in figure 2 after this step where there is a deep exposure with both chandra and xmm - newton .",
    "after this calculation , we have an estimate of the exposure - area for every square arcminute of the entire sky . for each arcminute of the sky",
    ", we also computed the distance to the aimpoint of any exposure for both chandra and xmm - newton exposures , in order to compare our candidate sources with an estimate of the psf size .",
    "we also estimated the average count rate for each square degree of the sky for background estimation .      using the chandra photons alone",
    "we located the point sources by finding photons where the number of neighbors within the local psf size exceeded the number of photons within twice the local psf size by two sigma .",
    "we only searched through a subset of photons in the relevant 1 by 1 arcminute block or the adjacent 1 by 1 arcminute block .",
    "this improved the computation efficiency of the algorithm .",
    "the local psf size was estimated to be @xmath23 arcseconds where @xmath24 is 15 arcminutes .",
    "photons which satisfied this condition held were tagged as candidate `` agn '' photons .",
    "we also randomly untagged a fraction of these photons in proportion to the relative count rate of photons with a local psf size to twice a local psf size .",
    "this allowed us to fill back in some photons which may be due to background .",
    "all chandra photons were then tagged as either `` agn '' photons like those in the top left panel in figure 3 or `` cluster+background '' photons like those in the lower left panel in figure 3 .    then for each chandra photon we removed a set of the nearest xmm - newton photons ( when there are any ) given by the ratio of the exposure - area maps we computed earlier .",
    "the nearest xmm - newton photon was found by computing ,    @xmath25 .    where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the difference in spatial coordinates , @xmath28 is the difference in measured photon energy ( in ev ) , and @xmath29 is the photon energy .",
    "thus , the selected photons were chosen to have a similar position and have similar energy . if the ratio of exposure - area maps was not an integer , we chose random numbers appropriately to decide whether to add extra photons to obtain the proper normalization .",
    "we also did not use xmm - newton photons outside of a 2 by 2 arcminute block as with the previous step for computational efficiency .",
    "this method then selected the xmm - newton agn photons even if the xmm - newton psf was large and if it was difficult to determine if the source was a cluster or agn from the xmm - newton data alone .",
    "we then have two sets of photons for the xmm - newton data as well : those that are removed are composed primarily of agn photons ( top right in figure 3 ) , and those that have not been removed that are either from clusters or background ( bottom right in figure 3 ) .",
    "the method is imperfect when the agn flux varies significantly between observations and due to noise , but we can estimate this by comparing the two maps . if we subtracted a lot of `` agn '' photons at a particular location and we found a source in the subtracted map then this was likely due to a subtraction problem .",
    "this is described in more detail in the next section .",
    "next , we constructed the combined maps by adding the xmm - newton and chandra maps for agn photons and clusters and background photons , respectively as shown in figure 4 .",
    "we only included photons from 0.5 to 2 kev , since now we wanted to maximize our sensitivity to finding new clusters and most of the cluster emission occurs in the soft band .",
    "we binned the photons into a 5 arcsecond grid and then find sources using a wavelet method which is a modified form of that described by vikhlinin 1998 . to do this , we computed functions of the following form :    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is a gaussian convolution of the map @xmath32 with scale @xmath3",
    ". these convolutions can be calculated most efficiently in fourier space .",
    "an estimate of the number of photons of a given source at position @xmath33 of size @xmath3 is given by    @xmath34    where the @xmath35 is the integral above using the soft band counts and @xmath36 is the integral using the exposure - area function .",
    "when the area - exposure map is constant this function will be equivalent to the normal spherical top - hat function used in wavelet applications .",
    "we stepped through every pixel of the map using source sizes from 1 to 32 pixels in step size of @xmath37 of 0.2 .",
    "we also estimate the hard band counts ( 2.0 to 7.0 kev ) and the agn soft band counts at the same position .",
    "the background rate was estimated locally by convolving a gaussian with @xmath3 of 480 arcseconds ( 3 times the largest source we allow ) .",
    "we found that the detection significance of a source could then be estimated by the formula    @xmath38 .    where @xmath39 is the counts function defined in the previous equation , @xmath40 is the background function using the previous equation with width of 480 arcseconds , and @xmath41 is a normalizing factor @xmath42 .",
    "we determined this function by performing monte carlo simulations of pure poisson noise .",
    "the first term dominates for high count rates and follows the gaussian form , and the second term corrects for the fact that at low count rates the distribution is non - gaussian .",
    "the detection significance , therefore , depends both on the number of photons in the source and the source size",
    ". we also found it necessary to calculate the signal to noise as well as the source significance ( signal divided by the square root of noise ) , because there were highly significant large sources that had low signal to noise .",
    "we then have a set of candidate sources at various positions and sizes .",
    "we only select sources with significances greater than 6 sigma and signal to noise greater than one .",
    "these limits were chosen so that we at most have one spurious source in the entire survey due to background fluctuation and do not include low signal to noise sources that may be due to non - statistical background calibration errors .    at this point , the candidate sources could overlap and be at adjacent locations because they all have enough detection significance . to select a unique set of sources ,",
    "we simply remove any candidate source that is within 3 source radii from another and has lower significance .",
    "the source radius is defined as the maximum @xmath3 of the two sources being compared .",
    "we found that this visually results in only one object being detected per actual source quite efficiently .    to test the ability to correctly measure the flux and size of sources",
    ", we performed a series of photon monte carlo simulations .",
    "we first randomly generated between 30 and 10,000 photons representing a cluster using a @xmath43 model .",
    "the core radius was randomly chosen between 2 and 10 pixels and @xmath43 was chosen between 0.5 and 0.75 .",
    "we then chose a background level randomly between @xmath44 and @xmath45 counts per pixel having poisson noise .",
    "this simulates the wide range of sources and conditions that we might find .",
    "we then used the source finding algorithm on the simulated image and found that the source flux was accurately recovered and the source size was accurately measured even in the presence of the different background conditions .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : fluxcalib ] . the typical scatter from the true values was @xmath46 and @xmath47 for the source size and flux , respectively .",
    "we also note that we recovered 495 out of the 500 sources we simulated .",
    "this indicates that our source finding algorithm is fairly robust to a range of background levels and source fluxes .",
    "we then have a large number of cluster candidates .",
    "we found it necessary to employ four further selection criteria to remove non - clusters .",
    "first , we computed the ratio of the counts in the cluster candidate to the counts in the agn map .",
    "we required this ratio to be greater than 4 . without this requirement ,",
    "agn which have increased flux between the chandra and xmm - newton exposures will be undersubtracted .",
    "this is rare since the variability is typically only about 10@xmath48 , but there are also many agn candidates",
    ".    we also found it necessary to require that the source size plus three times the measurement error is at least 4 arcseconds larger than the local psf size ,    @xmath49    this is a very conservative cut that removes about 30@xmath48 of the potential candidates . since , we have added three times the source size error , we are only effectively removing candidates that have very little chance of actually being legitimate clusters .",
    "we then expect that only a small fraction of this 30@xmath48 would be real clusters or groups that are removed accidentally .",
    "the local psf size is estimated by combining quadratically the estimate for the local chandra psf given in the previous section with the xmm - newton psf in proportion to their exposure area .",
    "the xmm - newton psf is assumed to be 10 arcseconds across the field of view , since it changes shape but its size does not change dramatically .",
    "the size error is determined by simply dividing the size by the square root of the number of counts .",
    "thus , by using the agn photon subtraction method above we have removed the vast majority of agn emission but there is some residual background due to agn variability .",
    "although this limits our ultimate sensitivity , our method is several times more sensitive than just finding sources and estimating the size without the photon subtraction .",
    "we also estimate the ellipticity of the source by calculating the second moment of the counts weighted by a gaussian with width equal to the size of the source .",
    "we then require the ellipticity to be less than 0.25 .",
    "this does not remove any clusters , but removes some spurious sources due to the readout streak .",
    "we also removed cluster candidates where the ratio of counts in the soft band over the counts in the hard band ( the spectral softness , @xmath50 ) follows the equation ,    @xmath51 .",
    "this cut cleanly removes some systematic fluctuations in the background .",
    "the softness of the background is defined as exactly 1 , since we set the middle our bands to be the median of the energy as described previously . for xmm - newton",
    "this results in energy range of 0.5 to 1.7 kev for the soft band and 1.7 to 7.0 kev for the hard band . for chandra",
    "this results in an energy range of 0.5 to 2.2 kev for the soft band and 2.2 to 7.0 kev for the hard bands . a high temperature , @xmath52",
    ", cluster has a softness near @xmath53 , however , and a lower temperature cluster has a much higher spectral softness",
    ".    finally , we found it necessary for some of the final candidates to be removed by human inspection , since they were obvious supernovae remnants , planets , or knots in emission that had survived all of our cluster selection procedures .",
    "we utilized a 4 node computing cluster to perform the calculations for this procedure on all the data sets in about a week , and perfected it after many iterations .",
    "after all the data selection procedures , we have 1198 cluster candidates as shown in figure 6 .",
    "many of these clusters were known sources and were in fact the targets of the relevant observation .",
    "there are 462 clusters that are outside of 4 arcminutes from the central pointing .",
    "later we will argue on the basis of the log n - log s distribution that this is a reliable estimate of the number of new clusters .",
    "after all these cuts we were able to use the agn in our sample to estimate how many of these objects would survive if they were incorrectly chosen as cluster candidates due to some mistake in the photon removal procedure .",
    "we find that 19 agn would survive these cuts that were more than 4 arcminutes outside the central pointing .",
    "thus , we estimate that the contamination in our survey of false clusters is about 3@xmath48 .",
    "we also need to estimate the efficiency of not removing real clusters .",
    "we have , however , performed monte carlo simulations that found 99@xmath48 of all of our simulated clusters .",
    "we note , however , that the cuts we have used above are designed to only remove objects that have completely inconsistent properties of a normal cluster . the one cut to worry about in particular",
    "might be the size cut , which could remove some particularly small groups .",
    "this cut , however , only removes 30@xmath48 of the candidates",
    "so even if some of these were real clusters it probably would not be much more than 3 to 5 @xmath48 .",
    "furthermore , none of the cuts remove any of the brightest 100 already well - known clusters .",
    "thus , we estimate that the efficiency of these candidate cuts is around 95@xmath48 and that might roughly cancel with the 3@xmath48 estimation for contamination . both of these estimates can be constrained more rigorously with simulations and optical follow - up .",
    "since we have used archival observations , a significant fraction of our sample will be comprised of previously known clusters that were the targets of their respective observations . in order to compare the cluster candidates with previously known clusters",
    ", we used the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "ned currently contains over 40,000 cluster candidates from over 300 surveys . in order to check our cluster candidates reliably , we deconstructed the ned catalog into the individual cluster catalogs .",
    "we then cross - correlated that catalog with itself to select objects within 1 arcminute of each other . a reasonable way to be confident that the cluster candidates are real is to simply require that the object appear in multiple catalogs whether they are x - ray surveys , optical , or any other kind of survey .",
    "we found that 261 ( out of 1198 that passed our selection cuts ) clusters in our survey were previously known .",
    "there was also a significant number of sources at the center of the field of view that were nearby galaxies and other extended sources .",
    "we constructed the log n - log s distribution for the clusters in our sample as shown in figure 11 .",
    "we plotted the log n - log s distribution in both the cumulative and differential forms ( figure 12 ) .",
    "the conversion from counts to flux was calculated by using webpimms using a column density of @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and abundance of 0.4 solar .",
    "although there is obviously variation in our clusters , the variation will be less than our flux bin width and these are expected typical values .",
    "the log n - log s distributions are then calculated by adding up the number of sources divided by the area of the survey that source in which that source could have been detected . since we have a different flux limit for every point in the survey , we had to take this into account .",
    "furthermore , our source detection sensitivity depends on the object s measured wavelet size .",
    "therefore , we calculated the survey area as a function of flux for each object taking into account our source selection function in figure 13 . for each square arcminute of the survey we calculate the total exposure and multiply that by a given flux .",
    "this gives us an estimate of the number of photons that would be produced by a source at that particular place in the sky .",
    "then we see if that would pass both our significance cut described in section 3.4 and our signal to noise cut for the background at that particular place in the field .",
    "thus , at high source fluxes the survey area is the full survey , but at low source flux it will be lower .",
    "we have assumed that our other selection cuts do not remove significant numbers of real clusters and largely remove spurious data artifacts .",
    "our earlier monte carlo simulations indicate for a wide range of sources that most of these ( 99@xmath48 ) are recovered by the source finding algorithm .",
    "we examined the subset of sources located a distance @xmath56 from the centers of observations in which they were detected , and varied @xmath56 until the log n - log s distribution convered .",
    "this occurs for @xmath56 @xmath17 4 arcminutes .",
    "we take this as an indication that the application of that cut removes the bias associated with selected pointings at known clusters .",
    "we also separated the log n - log s points for the overlapping chandra and xmm - newton survey ( red diamonds ) and the chandra only data ( green diamonds ) .",
    "the difference in these surveys gives us a rough measure of the systematic error , since these are completely different samples .",
    "we modelled the log",
    "n - log s distribution using the following method .",
    "first to be consistent with previous large angle surveys we adopted the schechter function as outlined in the review by @xcite ,    @xmath57    where we added the last factor to possibly cut off the luminosity on the low luminosity end to account for small groups that will not even emit x - rays even if they obey scaling relations .",
    "we used the values of @xmath58 ( has 15@xmath48 scatter in the literature ) , @xmath59 , @xmath60 ( has 50@xmath48 scatter in the literature ) from @xcite which summarize the previous work at the high flux end .",
    "we also used slightly lower values of @xmath61 and @xmath62 for a second calculation than the mean values measured in other work but still within the observational uncertainties to be conservative about the measurement of evolution as we discuss below .",
    "we then use this luminosity function and the comoving volume element of the universe for @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) to populate the universe with clusters as a function of redshift .",
    "then , we convert the luminosities of the clusters using the appropriate luminosity distance for the same cosmology .",
    "we also predict the fraction of these clusters that would be missed by our size cut by estimating the physical size , @xmath65 of the cluster following the relation of    @xmath66 .",
    "we determined this relation by looking at the clusters in our sample where we knew the redshift .",
    "this physical distance is converted into an angular size using the angular diameter distance for the same cosmologies .",
    "this allows us to predict the log n - log s distributions in figure 11",
    ".    we varied @xmath67 between @xmath68 and @xmath69 which had an minor effect on the curves .",
    "a luminosity of @xmath69 would correspond to a object with virial temperature around 400 ev and a luminosity of @xmath68 would correspond with a virial temperature around 100 ev . even if there are many objects in the universe with these sizes they would stop emitting significant x - rays somewhere in this range since the flux",
    "is located out of the x - ray band in this temperature range .    similarly , the cosmological parameters used in the calculation of the volume element have a small effect as well .",
    "we adopted the concordance values of @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .",
    "if we assume no evolution in this luminosity function then the data are completely inconsistent with the model using the nominal set of parameters for @xmath73 , @xmath67 , and @xmath74 as well as a conservative set of values for these parameters as shown in figure 11 . on the other hand ,",
    "if we modify @xmath73 by a factor of @xmath75 we can match the data only if q is greater than -2 .",
    "this demonstrates that we have measured the onset of cluster formation and have observed the dearth of clusters at high redshift .",
    "since the @xmath76 formulation shows rapid evolution , we have also simply tried to represent this rapid evolution as a @xmath77 instead . in figure 11 , we plot values of @xmath7 of 0.7,1.0 , and 1.3 along with the no evolution case .",
    "given the parameters of the model we have used , the data points towards rapid evolution at relatively low redshift of z=0.7 to 1.3 .",
    "the exact value may depend somewhat on our choice of parameters for the normalization and slope of the luminosity function .",
    "it also might be affected by unaccounted for inefficiencies of the survey which could reduce the number of observed clusters by 10 to 20% .",
    "note , however , that the size cut only mildly reduces the number of clusters and that cut would have to be falsely removing clusters as large as 20 arcseconds instead of 4 arcseconds to explain the evolution . to demonstrate this",
    ", we show the effect of a zero arcsecond and eight arcsecond cut in figure 13 .",
    "generally , there is little effect below a flux of @xmath9 .",
    "for that reason , it is very likely that the observed deficit at low fluxes is due to an actual absence of clusters at high redshift .",
    "note also that our exponential function describes the number density of clusters and not the absolute number of clusters which will peak at higher redshifts .",
    "this rapid evolution is generically predicted in models of structure formation with a non - negligible amount of matter in the universe .",
    "structure formation models predict a decrease in both the normalization of the cluster mass function at high redshift as well as a change in shape of the function @xcite . furthermore",
    ", if there is significant cluster evolution as we have argued , then the parameterization of evolution in terms of @xmath78 or @xmath79 is an oversimplification . in figure 14",
    ", we plot the range of exponential functions derived to match the log n - log s distribution .",
    "we then overlay the expected number density of clusters combining the @xcite theory with the power spectrum of @xcite in an identical calculation to that of @xcite for three different mass of clusters .",
    "we use the concordance parameters above and also set @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 .",
    "the agreement clearly demonstrates that the rapid evolution that we have measured is similar to what is expected for reasonable cluster masses .",
    "future detailed measurements and modelling when masses and redshifts can be estimated may measure the exact nature of the cluster evolution .",
    "the structure formation model predicts an evolution that varies as a function of mass , so we can predict the log n - log s distribution directly as an additional check .",
    "we must make the additional assumption of a mass - luminosity relation and assume that the theoretical mass function agrees well with the local luminosity function .",
    "we adopt the mass - luminosity relation of @xcite where @xmath84 .",
    "we ignored any redshift dependence of the relation to be conservative , since the change in the relation would make the evolution more significant .",
    "we also assume that simulated clusters with calculated luminosities below @xmath85 are suppressed by the same exponential function as before .",
    "the direct log n - log s calculation is shown in figure 15 , and agrees quite well given the uncertainties in our mass calibration .",
    "our results are generally consistent with intermediate flux rosat surveys at @xmath86 as measured in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . near a flux of @xmath87",
    "our results deviate somewhat particularly with those of @xcite and are closest to those of @xcite .",
    "a combination of some non - cluster contamination and an underestimate of the survey sensitivity could explain these discrepancies .",
    "considering the error ranges , however , these measurements could still be consistent with some mild cluster evolution .",
    "our results are complementary to those at high fluxes , e.g. @xcite , and we have fixed our theoretical model consistent with those results .",
    "our results are also broadly consistent with the recent work of vikhlinin where cluster masses have been estimated for a sample of 36 clusters @xcite . in this work",
    ", he demonstrated that a lower redshift sample ( @xmath88 ) had a different and lower normalization mass function than the cluster at higher redshift @xmath89 .",
    "the results were consistent with the concordance structure formation model discussed above . in a later work , vikhlinin measured the equation of state parameter for dark energy to 10@xmath48 @xcite .",
    "since our sample is larger and deeper , it might be possible to measure the equation of state parameter to 2@xmath48 in a different mass and redshift regime .",
    "our results are inconsistent , however , with the log",
    "n - log s distribution determined using the chandra deep field @xcite .",
    "this was determined by using 130 square arcminutes and finding six candidates clusters in that survey that suggested there was no evolution in the cluster luminosity function .",
    "these objects , however , have signal to noise less than 1 ( table 1 , column 6 of their paper ) , so would not survive our signal to noise cut . if we remove our signal to noise cut we find 3 out of the six objects . if only two or three are clusters , then we would be consistent with this measurement .",
    "similarly , both @xcite and @xcite found clusters in deep and narrow surveys .",
    "@xcite do not make a claim about cluster number density .",
    "if we convert their data to log n - log s as in @xcite , then they are consistent with our measurements at @xmath90 but inconsistent at lower fluxes .",
    "@xcite argue , however , that many of these sources could be contaminated by hard x - ray emission from agn .",
    "our results are consistent with previous measurements of the evolution of the luminosity functions where the redshifts were known in the rosat deep cluster survey and the einstein medium sensitivity surveys ( @xcite and see figure 9 in @xcite ) , although the interpretation is somewhat different . there",
    "the authors considered both an evolution in the normalization and the value of @xmath91 ( in their notation the parameters are a and b ) . in our case , the evolution factor , @xmath92 , is equivalent to @xmath93 .",
    "the previous results have constrained the value of @xmath93 to be approximately equal to @xmath94 , which is also completely consistent with our result .",
    "the other authors have argued , however , that the data are more consistent with mostly a non - zero value of @xmath95 , which we can not distinguish from the flux distribution alone . in addition , our sample is much deeper and it is likely that the schechter formulation is not even correct to such a large range in redshifts . in any case ,",
    "negative evolution in the clusters x - ray luminosity function and the emergence of clusters in the universe has been clearly observed .",
    "additional detailed photon monte carlo simulations like those we have proposed above as well as optical follow - up to remove spurious sources are needed to verify the efficiency and contamination we have claimed in the log n - log s calculation .",
    "however , the large deviation of the log n - log s curve at @xmath9 compared to the future model is beyond any reasonable expected systematic error .",
    "there are several research areas that can be pursued in the future with this cluster sample .",
    "first , the efficiency of the survey can be carefully calculated by futher monte carlo simulations .",
    "second , the bias of the survey can be more accurately estimated by performing a blind survey on a modest field .",
    "third , the redshifts of the new clusters can be measured by optical and ir follow - up including cluster verification .",
    "fourth , the cluster abundance can be measured by combining the efficiency calculation and the redshifts .",
    "fifth , the x - ray estimated cluster masses can be compared to weak lensing measurements for at least some of the clusters . then by assigning these clusters to a given mass and redshift , the structure formation theory can be tested in great detail .",
    "finally , the xmm - newton and chandra archive continues to accumulate more data , so a much larger survey can be performed in the future .",
    "some portion of this additional work is necessary prior to a robust estimate systematic errors of cosmological parameters .",
    "we acknowledge many helpful conversations with karl andersson , kari frank , suzanne nichols , frits paerels , masao sako , caleb scharf , and mark voit .",
    "support for this work for jrp , jgj , and jb is from a nasa grant nnx07ah51 g from the nasa - adp program .",
    "jrp is also supported from a grant from the purdue research foundation ."
