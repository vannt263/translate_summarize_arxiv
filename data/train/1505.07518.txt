    "as acknowledged by nomenclature , descartes concept of coordinates depends on the notion of a cartesian product .",
    "omnipresent in mathematics , it is already used in basic arithmetic to build number systems like the field of complex numbers or to define exterior bundles on manifolds .",
    "the cartesian product allows to build and access higher dimensional features of geometric spaces .",
    "many constructions in topology like suspensions , joins , fibre bundles , de rham cohomology or homotopy deformations would not work without the concept of a cartesian product .",
    "of course , we would like to have a product in graph theory which shares the properties from the continuum .",
    "the new graph product will achieve that .",
    "it will allow to use  coordinates \" similarly as they are used in the continuum .",
    "for two arbitrary networks @xmath39 - that is @xmath7 and @xmath11 are finite simple graphs - the coordinates of the product graph @xmath0 consists of all pairs of complete subgraphs of @xmath7 and @xmath11 .",
    "the exterior derivatives in @xmath7 and @xmath11 will play the role of the  partial derivatives \" in the product and allow to build an exterior de rham derivative on the product graph @xmath0 .",
    "the actual exterior derivative on the product graph @xmath0 operates on a much larger complex .",
    "the later is called the whitney complex and is defined by the simplices in the product .",
    "having a product allows to work with ",
    "rectangular boxes\"s in the product space rather than with simplices .",
    "figure  ( [ poster ] ) illustrates this for a small example . to take a picture from the continuum : the curl in the plane is an infinitesimal line integral along a rectangle and uses the leibnitz rule to relate the exterior derivative of the factors with the exterior derivative @xmath40 of the product .",
    "a simplicial point of view of cohomology integrates around infinitesimal triangles to get the curl , ignoring the product structure .",
    "de rham establishes equivalence of the two pictures on any smooth manifold . in order to prove the knneth formula , we will need to emulate the de rham theorem combinatorially .",
    "to do so , we explicitly construct a @xmath26-form on the whitney complex of @xmath0 from a @xmath26-form on the de rham complex defined by the two graphs @xmath39 .",
    "the chain map is concrete as we can from this construct explicit cohomology classes of the product from the cohomology classes in @xmath7 or @xmath11 .",
    "the relation is what one calls a chain homotopy",
    ". the de rham picture will be useful if we work with ",
    "discrete n - manifolds \" obtained by gluing together local charts of products @xmath41 of networks or when working with  fibre bundles \" @xmath42 obtained by gluing locally trivial charts @xmath43 of networks above a discrete manifold covered with charts @xmath44 .",
    "the automorphism group of the fibre @xmath7 will then play the role of a gauge group on @xmath45 , as it does in the continuum .",
    "+ when looking at graphs as geometric structures without dimension restriction , an amazing similarity with the continuum emerges .",
    "it turns out that in the discrete , one can access the local structure of space @xmath7 directly as the complete subgraphs of @xmath7 .",
    "these simplices can serve as fundamental entities playing the role of  points \" .",
    "such insight has been promoted already in @xcite but most of the time still graphs are treated as one dimensional simplicial complexes .",
    "an illustration on how the change of view point allows to emulate results from the continuum is the fixed point theorem of brouwer and lefschetz which looks identical to the result in the continuum @xcite .",
    "many concepts become elementary : cohomology is part of finite dimensional linear algebra , to compute valuations , generalized volumes , one needs integral geometric tools in the continuum , while in the discrete is is just count of complete subgraphs .",
    "the discrete hadwiger theorem @xcite is much easier than the continuum version : the numbers @xmath46 of @xmath47-dimensional simplices is a basis for the linear space of valuations .",
    "differential forms are just functions on a simplex graph and stokes theorem in the whitney complex is a tautology ; it becomes only less obvious when stokes is considered in a de rham setup .",
    "much intuition about higher dimensions can be obtained inductively .",
    "there are notions of dimension , cohomology , homotopy , cobordisms , ramified covers , degree and index , spheres , geodesic lines and curvature which lead to results mirroring the results in the continuum .",
    "this is not only true for nice geometric graphs but for general undirected networks or finite simple graphs - and much works without any exceptions .",
    "the notion of homotopy of graphs for example immediately leads to the homotopy of a graph embedded in an other graph and so to homotopy groups for general finite simple graphs .",
    "the product defined here will actually help to define the homotopy groups as graphs might be too small at first to have spheres embedded , so that the graph should first be refined .",
    "but the hurewicz homomorphisms from the homotopy groups @xmath48 to the cohomology groups @xmath49 are then so explicit that one can even watch it happen : just apply the heat flow to a @xmath26-forms with support on the @xmath26-simplices on the embedded @xmath26-sphere .",
    "it converges to a harmonic form which by hodge theory represents a cohomology classes . in the continuum",
    ", such a proof requires de rham currents , generalized differential forms which require some functional analysis . in the graph case ,",
    "the heat flow is just a linear ordinary differential equation of the type studied in introductory linear algebra courses .",
    "the definition of homotopy groups which are relevant in coloring questions for graphs @xcite allows to work with spheres in graph theory in the same way as in the continuum .",
    "+ the euclidean product is not only essential for defining fundamental objects like fibre bundles , it is also needed to construct spaces which have the same properties than classical manifolds .",
    "examples of such properties are dimension , homotopy , cohomology or euler characteristic .",
    "the goal of this note is to give such a product , allowing the use tools like discrete fibre bundles in graph theory .",
    "we will see that this can be done purely algebraically : as we can glue graphs together , this gluing carries over to the product allowing to build discrete bundles . and",
    "if the fibres carry an automorphism group @xmath50 , we get discrete analogues of principle bundles on which an enlarged gauge group acts .",
    "+    a cartesian product for a category of a geometry needs to be dimension - additive , it needs to induce a product on the homotopy classes , it needs to be euler characteristic multiplicative , it must satisfy the knneth formula equating the tensor product of the cohomology rings with the cohomology ring of the product and it must have the property that the automorphism group contains the automorphism groups of the factors .",
    "+ as for graphs , no previously defined product shares these properties .",
    "the standard cartesian product @xmath51 of the cyclic graph @xmath52 with @xmath52 for example is a graph of dimension @xmath53 .",
    "its vertices are the cartesian product of the vertices and two points @xmath54 are connected , if @xmath55 or @xmath56 .",
    "the cohomology of the standard cartesian product has little to do with the cohomology of the factors : the betti numbers of @xmath57 for example is @xmath58 while the betti number of our product is @xmath59 , which is identical to the one of the two - dimensional torus in classical topology .",
    "the dimension of the traditional product is @xmath53 while the dimension of our product is @xmath60 .",
    "also other constructions like the  tensor product \" , the  direct product \" or the  strong product \" of graphs do not have the topological properties we want .",
    "the reason for the shortcomings of all these products is that they do not tap into the lower dimensional building blocks of space : these are the simplices = complete subgraphs in the graph case .",
    "what in the continuum has to be done with sheaf theoretical constructs , is already pre - wired in the graph as we can access the lower dimensional simplices as  points \" .",
    "the new product has the property for example that @xmath61 is a @xmath62-dimensional torus of euler characteristic @xmath63 and betti vector @xmath64 .",
    "it is a triangularization of @xmath65 and each unit sphere @xmath27 is a @xmath60-dimensional sphere of euler characteristic @xmath60 .",
    "the product has practical use as it allows to construct high dimensional geometric spaces from smaller dimensional ones .",
    "the product works for any pair of graphs and leaves geometric @xmath66-dimensional graphs invariant , graphs for which all unit spheres are @xmath67-dimensional homotopy spheres defined in @xcite .",
    "the product will again have this property .",
    "cohomology , dimension and homotopy properties of the product are identical to the properties in the continuum . even in the case of fractal dimension , the dimension formula matches the corresponding product formula in the continuum @xcite ( formula 7.2 ) for the hausdorff dimension of arbitrary sets in euclidean space .",
    "there are more analogues : for hausdorff dimension , there are sets of dimension zero for which the product has dimension @xmath53 . while graphs of dimension @xmath63 are geometric , so that one gets equality , there are sequences of graphs like @xmath68 for which @xmath69 and @xmath70 , mirroring the continuum again .",
    "an other useful feature of the product is that it allows to refine graphs : the enhanced graph @xmath71 is a barycentric refinement of @xmath7 and this can be repeated : the sequence @xmath72 produces a finer and finer mesh whose dimension converges to an integer and honor the original symmetries if @xmath38 is a subgroup of the automorphism group then @xmath50 still acts on the refinement .",
    "the later is important when looking at discrete principal bundles . moreover , while @xmath37 is in general no more a graph , the quotient @xmath73 is , so that we can as in the continuum form covering spaces ramified over rather general subgraphs .",
    "for example , while @xmath74 acting on @xmath75 has a quotient @xmath76 which is only a chain and no more a finite simple graph , the quotient @xmath77 is a graph . as an other example , the quotient @xmath78 of the octahedron modulo the @xmath79 action given by the antipodal reflection group @xmath80 is no more a geometric graph without boundary as it is the wheel graph @xmath81 for which we can see the octahedron as a double cover ramified over the equator ( riemann - hurwitz in the discrete is just the burnside lemma considered simultaneously for the various simplex sceletons as noted in @xcite ) , but @xmath82 is a geometric graph , a discrete projective plane . as unit spheres of geometric graphs",
    "are spheres , the product can be used to construct new spheres . by taking refinements and then taking quotients",
    ", one can get more general discrete graphs like the projective plane in the simplest case . the product construction can also help for other constructions , like constructing joins or building discrete hopf fibrations in arbitrary dimensions . as every unit sphere in the product has the structure @xmath83 which is the union of two solid tori glued along the torus @xmath84 . in the case",
    "when taking the product of @xmath60-dimensional geometric graphs , we get so @xmath62-dimensional spheres which have naturally the same hopf fibration structure as in the continuum .",
    "+ classically , the notion of a homotopy of two continuous maps @xmath85 is defined using the product : if there is a continuous map @xmath86 \\to y$ ] , such that @xmath87 and @xmath88 , then @xmath89 are called homotopic .",
    "this could be done now also for graphs : two graph homomorphisms @xmath90 are homotopic , if there exists a line graph @xmath91 and a graph homomorphism @xmath92 from @xmath93 to @xmath11 such that @xmath87 and @xmath94 .",
    "we have suggested in @xcite an other definition : two graph homomorphisms @xmath90 are homotopic if the  graph of the graph homomorphisms \" are homotopic graphs .",
    "these graphs of homomorphisms have as vertices the union @xmath95 and as edges all pairs @xmath96 and pairs @xmath97 with @xmath98 .",
    "two graph homomorphisms are now homotopic , if the corresponding graphs are homotopic as graphs .",
    "we believe that these two definitions are equivalent , but have not yet proven this . in any case , we have the whiteheads theorem that if there is a graph homomorphism @xmath99 which induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups @xmath100 , then @xmath39 are homotopic . and as in the continuum , having isomorphic homotopy groups does not force a homotopy equivalence . now , with a product we can take the same standard counter example @xmath101 and @xmath102 , where @xmath103 are graph implementations of the @xmath26-dimensional projective space and @xmath104 are @xmath26-spheres . since they have the same universal cover @xmath105 and the same fundamental group @xmath79 , they have the same homotopy groups but the knneth formula implies that the poincar polynomial of @xmath101 is @xmath106 while the poincar polynomial of @xmath102 is @xmath107 . having different cohomology groups",
    "prevents the two graphs @xmath39 to be homotopic .",
    "we see in this example , how useful it is to have a product in graph theory which shares the properties from the continuum .",
    "the point is that one does not have to reinvent the wheel in graph theory but that one can piggy - pack on known topology .",
    "+    from a practical point of view , the construction of the product only needs a few lines of code for a standard computer algebra system .",
    "the full computer code is given in detail later on .",
    "the product works for all finite simple graphs : first construct the ring elements @xmath108 which are polynomial in @xmath109 representing the vertices of @xmath7 and @xmath110 , the vertices of @xmath11 , then take the product @xmath111 and construct from this a polynomial in the variables @xmath112 , the new graph @xmath0 by connecting two monomial terms of a polynomial if one divides the other .",
    "for example , if @xmath113 then @xmath114 and if @xmath115 then @xmath116 , we get @xmath117 which encodes a wheel graph @xmath118 with central vertex represented by @xmath119 .",
    "we see that the product naturally extends to chains , group elements in the ring and that it corresponds to the product in the tensor product of the two rings .",
    "every polynomial defines back a graph , but the later does in general not not agree with the original host graph .",
    "for example , take @xmath113 and the chain element @xmath120 , which defines in turn a graph which is the disjoint union of @xmath121 ( represented by @xmath122 ) and @xmath123 represented by @xmath124 .",
    "chains are useful constructs because natural operations escape the class of graphs : examples are forming the boundary @xmath125 or taking quotients @xmath37 with a subgroup @xmath50 of the automomorphism group of @xmath7 .",
    "chains form a ring and have properties wanted from a geometric object : a dimension , a cohomology , a notion of homotopy , an euler characteristic , a notion of curvature and these notions match the results we expect from the familiar cases : results like gauss - bonnet @xcite , mckean singer and hodge - de - rham @xcite , poincar - hopf @xcite , brower - lefschetz @xcite , riemann - roch ( @xcite is a strong enough theory so that it can be extended to higher dimensions ) , integrable geometric evolutions @xcite , riemann - hurwitz @xcite , lusternik - schnirelmann @xcite , mirror the results in the continuum .",
    "see also @xcite for an overview from the linear algebra point of view .",
    "these results are more limited , if one considered graphs as one - dimensional simplicial complexes only , a common assumption taken in the 20th century . as graph theory is a discrete theory , it can surprise at first that the situation parallels the continuum so well but there are conceptual reasons for that , an example is non - standard analysis , an other is integral geometry .",
    "some notions go over pretty smoothly , like cohomology or homotopy : others , like the notion of homeomorphisms for graphs needs more adaptations @xcite . + about the history : knneth found the formula in 1921 @xcite , where it was his dissertation under the guidance of heinrich tietze .",
    "the paper published in 1923 @xcite is a linear algebra analysis which could probably be simplified considerably using hodge theory .",
    "knneth attributes the cartesian product of manifolds to steinitz ( 1908 ) ( the definition is indeed given in @xcite p.44 is probably the first appearance of the simplicial product which our definition is based on ) . the notion of manifolds was initiated by poincar ( 1895 ) , weyl ( 1912 ) , veblen and alexander @xcite ( 1913 ) and whitney @xcite ( 1936 ) .",
    "it was herbert seifert who introduced fibre bundles in 1933 @xcite .",
    "the eilenberg - zilber theorem of 1953 @xcite .",
    "( joseph abraham zilber was a boston born harvard graduate ( 1943 ) and phd ( 1963 ) .",
    "interestingly , the eilenberg - zilber theorem was authored 10 years before zilber got his phd degree under the guidance of andrew gleason .",
    "more information about the history of algebraic topology , see @xcite or the introduction to @xcite .",
    "the classical cartesian product of graphs was introduced by whitehead and russell in principia mathematica 1912 ( it is @xcite who spotted the construction on page 384 in volume 2 of that epic work ) .",
    "it was introduced there in the context of logical relations , not so much graph theory . this historical observation and many properties of the classical product product",
    "are discussed in @xcite . +",
    "as far as we know , our present paper is the first establishing a knneth formula for finite simple graphs .",
    "there is a functorial approach to knneth for digraphs , where @xcite use path cohomology to get a functor from digraphs to cw complexes , so that one can then use the continuum result for the cw complexes .",
    "note however that in their case , one gets knneth only indirectly by constructing a cw - complex , take the product using the cartesian embedding and then pulling the result again to graphs .",
    "in particular , the notion of dimension is also borrowed from the continuum as cw - complexes are topological spaces .",
    "a similar thing could be done for geometric graphs , graphs for which the unit spheres @xmath27 are homotopy @xmath19-spheres .",
    "one can then build for each ball @xmath126 an open set in @xmath127 and use this to build a manifold @xmath128 .",
    "the open sets form then a nice good cover and the topology of the manifold is the same than the topology of the geometric graph .",
    "this construction is restricted however to geometric graphs .",
    "+ the missing cartesian product bothered us for a while so that we decided to make a targeted search over several weeks ( while procrastinating from an urgent programming job still in need to be finished in geometric graph coloring ) , trying several possibilities and checking with the computer whether the construction works .",
    "the product described here was obtained by trying random things which look  beautiful \" .",
    "the current product is attractive when seen algebraically because it becomes associative on the algebraic level . until now",
    ", we would just take the usual product and then fill out the chambers .",
    "when working with graphs , this is cumbersome , even when staying within the discrete , as it costs programming effort to build examples , like stellated higher dimensional cubes .",
    "the product which we propose here for graphs seems not to be known in the language of graphs .",
    "one could of course take the product @xmath129 of the corresponding topological spaces as knneth did .",
    "after finding the product , we looked around whether it already exists : closest to what we do here appeared as an exercise in an algebraic topology course by peter tennant johnstone at cambridge @xcite . more digging",
    "revealed that this simplicial product has been used by eilenberg and zilber in @xcite ( page 204 ) , by de rham @xcite ( page 191 ) and earlier by steinitz in @xcite ( page 44 ) . but this product never made it to graph theory .",
    "one could also get a product by escaping to the euclidean space .",
    "our reluctance to use euclidean stuff is not because we feel like brouwer ( who would even refuse to accept the infinity of natural numbers ) , but simply out of pragmatism : we want to build the structures fast on a computer without having to use euclidean parts .",
    "graphs are natural structures built into computer algebra languages and the euclidean embeddings are not needed , when doing computations ; only if we want to see the graphs visualized or modeling traditional geometric objects , the euclidean embedding is helpful . here is a self - contained full implementation of the new graph product in  mathematica \" , a computer algebra system which uses graphs as fundamental objects in its core language , structures which are dispatched from euclidean embeddings , unless they are drawn .",
