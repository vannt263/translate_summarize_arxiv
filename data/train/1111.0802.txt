    "from the physical standpoint , to describe the nucleon system , one must know the nucleon properties and inter - nucleonic forces .",
    "the world constants and nucleon properties are known within sufficient accuracy , while inter - nucleonic forces are complicated in character and are known to a less accuracy . unlike the atom , these forces can not be described by the 1/@xmath1 ratio ( where r is the distance between nucleons ) or by more complicated expressions like the woods - saxon potential @xcite .",
    "the distinctive feature of inter - nucleonic forces is that they depend not only on the distance _",
    "r _ , but also on the quantum configuration of the nucleon system , which is determined by the orbital momentum _",
    "spin _ s _ and isospin _ t _ of this system .    the _ nn _ potential can be determined phenomenologically from the experimental data on the ground state of the two - nucleon system and on the elastic ( _ p , p _ ) , ( _ n , p _ ) and ( _ n , n _ ) scattering at nucleon energies up to 500 mev . at higher nucleon energies ,",
    "nonelastic processes come into play , and the potential approach becomes inapplicable",
    ". however , the data about the inter - nucleonic forces in this nucleon energy region are sufficient for the description of nucleus ground state , and also of nuclear reactions up to the meson - producing threshold .    nowadays , argonne av18 @xcite and cd - bonn @xcite appear to be the most accurate potentials . in the construction of the charge - dependent cd - bonn potential in the range of laboratory - system nucleon energies up to 350 mev , 2932 ( _ p , p_)- and 3058 ( _",
    "n , p_)- scattering data were used .",
    "adjustable expressions were derived on the basis of the meson model of strong interaction of nucleons . into the account",
    "were taken the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 -one - meson - exchange contribution , @xmath6- one - boson - exchange , 2@xmath2 -exchange , including @xmath7-isobar configurations , and of the @xmath2@xmath4-exchange contribution .",
    "the calculations of the _ nn _ potential waves were up to @xmath84 ( the following notation is used for the purpose : @xmath9 , _ j _ is the total momentum of the system ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath10/datum was found to be 1.02 .",
    "mathematically , to describe the nucleon system , it is necessary to use the accurate methods of solving the many - body problem . to describe the three - body system in the case of an arbitrary two - body potential ,",
    "faddeev @xcite suggested solving a set of connected integral equations .",
    "later on , yakubovsky @xcite generalized this result for the case of any number of particles in the system .    at present , it is found that 3_n _ forces take action in the nucleus . in the calculations ,",
    "the 3_n _ potentials of types urbanaix @xcite and tucson - melbourne @xcite are most frequently used .",
    "so , for exact description of a many - nucleon system it is necessary to solve the set of connected integral equations with due regard for the contribution of _ nn _ and 3_n _ forces .",
    "the solution of the problem by the faddeev - yakubovsky ( fy ) method was reported by gloeckle and kamada ( gk ) @xcite .",
    "the characteristics of ground states three- and four - nucleon nucleus by the fygk method were calculated in papers @xcite-@xcite .",

    "the investigation of disintegration of polarized @xmath11he nuclei by polarized beams of particles can provide some new information about 3_n _ forces .",
    "along with the elaboration more precise definition of phenomenological potentials , important results were obtained through theoretical calculations of inter - nucleonic forces within the framework of chiral effective field theory ( eft ) . at present , the calculation of chiral interactions is not as accurate as that of phenomenological _ nn _ forces . calculated within the framework of the eft , the _ nn _ potential parameters for partial waves with j@xmath122 @xcite are in satisfactory agreement with the experiment in the region of nucleon lab energy up to @xmath13290 mev . in the context of the eft , rozpedzik _ et al . _",
    "@xcite estimated the effect of 4_n _ forces and found the additional contribution of 4_n _ forces to the binding energy of the @xmath0he nucleus to be about several hundreds of kev .",
    "the calculations in the context of eft are of particular importance for explaining the origin and explicit representation of 3_n _ and 4_n _ forces .",
    "the reason is that there are a good many experimental data to determine the _ nn _ potential , whereas for determination of 3_n _ and 4_n _ forces these data are not nearly enough .",
    "the origin and the explicit form of 3_n _ and 4_n _ forces is a basic issue of few - nucleon systems .",
    "section 2 presents the results of theoretical calculations of the ground states of few - nucleon nuclei , and also , the examples of nuclear reaction calculations based on the realistic _ nn _ and _ nnn _ forces . section 3 describes the results of the study into the @xmath0he nuclei structure , and also , presents the multipole analysis of the @xmath0he(@xmath14)@xmath11h and @xmath0he(@xmath15)@xmath11he reactions , performed on the basis of the experimental data about the differential cross - section and cross - section asymmetry reactions with linearly polarized photons .",

    "the consideration of large total - momentum values of the two - nucleon system is necessary , for example , for a correct calculation of short - range correlations . in the calculation @xcite ,",
    "account was taken of the states , in which the sum of orbital momenta of all nucleons of the @xmath0he nucleus was no more than @xmath18=14 .",
    "the authors of this work estimated their mistake in the calculations of @xmath0he nuclei binding energy to be @xmath1950 kev . considering that the calculated value of the binding energy is @xmath19200 kev higher than the experimental value",

    "the occurrence of states with nonzero orbital momenta of nucleons in the lightest nuclei is a manifestation of the properties of inter - nucleonic forces and , hence , such effects should be observed without exception in all nuclei as well as in all their excited states .",
    "one can suppose that the contribution of the effects connected with the tensor part of _ nn _ potential and 3_nf , s _ increases with a growth of the atomic number .",
    "firstly , it can be seen , for example , from the fact that the _ d_-state contribution in the deuteron is about 5% , while in the @xmath0he nucleus it makes @xmath1916% . secondly ,",
    "if the @xmath21c nucleus is assumed to consist of three weakly bound @xmath16-clusters , then the tensor part of _ nn _ interaction and 3_nf , s _ would cause initially the first cluster to be in the states with the orbital momenta larger than predicted by the shell model of the nuclei ( smn ) @xcite , @xcite , then the second cluster would be the next , and so on .",
    "correspondingly , the @xmath21c nucleus would stay about 40% of time in the states with the orbital momenta larger than predicted by the smn . in the other approach , similarly to the case with the @xmath0he nucleus , we must bear in mind that the nucleus spin of @xmath21c can take the values 0@xmath226 , the total orbital momentum of nucleus of @xmath21c can be 0@xmath236 , and the orbital momenta of separate nucleus can take on any values , which are not forbidden by the pauli principle . though the probabilities of these states are so far difficult to calculate , it can be expected that the result will be close to the above - given rough estimate .",
    "contribution spin - orbit of the interaction _ a _ nucleons in the potential energy nucleus can be assessed by the relation :    @xmath24    where _ v _ is the spherically symmetrical potential , _",
    "l _ is the orbital momentum , _ s _ is the spin of the nucleon .",
    "however , for the agreement of the experimental data into the expression ( 1 ) was put a constant , which is @xmath2510 .",
    "the appearance of the fitting constant @xmath26 can be partially explained as follows .",
    "k_-number of the nucleons , with the orbital momenta in accordance with the smn , and other _ a - k _ nucleons have orbital momenta bigger than it is predicted by the smn .",
    "then the expression ( 1 ) can be refined as :    @xmath27    where , @xmath28 is the probability for the _ i_-th nucleon to have the orbital momentum @xmath29 .",
    "the sum of probabilities is @xmath30=1 .",
    "thus , in the case of the lightest nuclei second summand of the expression ( 2 ) leads to the small but not equal zero impact of spin - orbital interaction to the potential energy of the nucleus . in middle and",
    "heavy nuclei nucleons are situated , generally , in @xmath31 states .",
    "in other words , the tensor part of _ nn _ potential and 3_n _ forces push the nucleons outside of nuclear shells , with the rise of atomic number the role of this effects is rising at that . the main is the second summand , which is not predicted by smn , which may explain the difference between sequence of the magic numbers for the atom and for the nucleus . in particular , calculations , made on the basis of the woods - saxon potential @xcite ,",
    "can give the overestimation of the protons number z for the position of the `` stability island '' of the superheavy nuclei .",
    "a full calculation of the nuclear reaction must take into account the ground - state structure of the nucleus , the contribution of the interaction of the probe with nucleons and meson exchange currents ( mec ) , and the final - state interaction of particles ( fsi ) .",
