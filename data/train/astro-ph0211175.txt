    "in the absence of gradients of velocity and magnetic field in the resolution element , the polarization emerging from an atmosphere must be either symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to the central wavelength of each spectral line ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the polarization observed in the solar photosphere does not show such symmetries .",
    "asymmetric stokes profiles to represent the intensity , stokes @xmath2 and @xmath3 for the two independent types of linear polarization , and stokes @xmath0 for the degree of circular polarization .",
    "examples are given in figure [ full_vs_misma ] .",
    "] arise from the quiet sun ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) , from plages and network regions ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) , as well as from sunspot penumbrae ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the fact that such asymmetries are found even when observing at the limit of present resolution suggests that a rich structuring remains unresolved to the current observations . because asymmetries carry information on the spatially unresolved properties of the photospheric plasma , their study and correct interpretation offers a chance to overcome the limitations imposed by the angular resolution , and to retrieve information inaccessible to direct imaging .",
    "indeed , such possibility has been exploited during the last decade , always relying on a considerable amount of modeling and assumptions . in broad terms , one can distinguish two approaches depending on the size of the unresolved structures that are responsible for the asymmetries .",
    "the first approach assumes that the unresolved photospheric structures are actually on the verge of being resolved in broad - band images taken with the current instrumentation .",
    "the smallest detectable features are of the order of 0.2(or 150 km on the sun ) ; a size set by technical limitations of the present solar telescopes ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ) . several models of this kind have been proposed to explain asymmetries in special cases like penumbrae , plage and network regions , and in the quiet sun ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "for example , @xcite ( @xcite ) invokes special thermal structures ( temperature inversion ) within magnetic regions in order to explain some extreme stokes @xmath0 shapes frequently observed in the quiet sun .",
    "the distinctive feature of this approach is that the proposed configurations ( thermal , magnetic or kinetic ) are specific to the case under study .",
    "the fact that asymmetries occur everywhere is therefore difficult to explain within this framework .",
    "the second approach is more consonant with the ubiquity of the asymmetries in the polarization of photospheric lines .",
    "it assumes that the photospheric plasma is in a turbulent state and that small - scale structures both in velocity and magnetic field are present .",
    "order of magnitude estimates for the magnetic and kinetic reynolds numbers in the granulation indicate that the magnetic field could be structured on spatial scales as small as a few kilometers ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "this picture is consistent with recent progress in dynamo theory suggesting that a substantial part of the magnetic field in the quiet sun could be generated locally by dynamo action driven by the granular flows ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "this second approach is also supported by certain observations indicating that the magnetic field is structured on spatial scales below the resolution limit of current telescopes ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "based on these premises , it is reasonable to think of the asymmetries as the result of observing magnetic fields that vary spatially on scales much smaller than the mean - free - path of the photons .",
    "interpretations of stokes profiles taking into account this very fine structuring of the atmosphere have been carried out for several years ( @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the model atmospheres used to fit the observed profiles consist of a collection of magnetic and non - magnetic components , each containing mild gradients to comply with the height variations of the mean photosphere , but interleaved in such a way as to produce large gradients along the line - of - sight  ( @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the appealing aspect of this approach is that asymmetries emerge spontaneously , and independently of the details of the model ; arising from correlations between the magnetic and the velocity fields of the various components ( e.g. , asymmetries occur if , on average , downflowing elements have low magnetic field strength ) . it is known that atmospheres with micro - structure reproduce all kinds of stokes profiles observed in the quiet sun , including network and inter - network ( in ) regions ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite )",
    ". these micro - structured magnetic atmospheres ( mismas ) portray a quiet sun with large amounts of unsigned magnetic flux and very complex magnetic topology ( very often two magnetic polarities coincide in a resolution element ) .    in the present paper",
    "we take advantage of recent developments in the numerical modeling of surface dynamos to understand the origin of asymmetries in the line polarization .",
    "we use the magnetic and velocity fields from a set of numerical data generated to study the interaction between thermally driven turbulent convection and magnetic fields ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "although these numerical simulations were not designed for a detailed description of the solar photosphere , the complexity and ubiquity of its fields recall in many respects the magnetic quiet sun inferred from the observed asymmetries . assuming a milne - eddington ( me ) atmosphere for the thermodynamic variables we produce synthetic stokes profiles .",
    "thus , the asymmetries in the resulting profiles are directly related to the correlations between the velocity and the magnetic field that exist in the numerical data , but they are decoupled from the thermodynamic variables of the simulation .",
    "the comparison between the synthetic profiles and solar data shows that the synthetic spectra are frequently similar to the observed ones .",
    "such agreement suggests that the simulation includes some of the ingredients that characterize the quiet sun magnetic fields ; in particular , the correlations between magnetic field and velocity at the smallest spatial scales . on the other hand , discrepancies between synthetic and observed stokes profiles allow to identify missing ingredients and , consequently , to devise strategies to improve the simulations and the inversions . finally , following @xcite ( @xcite )",
    ", one can use the synthetic profiles to estimate the angular resolution required to determine the basic properties of the magnetic structures present in the numerical simulation .",
    "this angular resolution may be of relevance to decide the specifications of new solar instruments .",
    "the work is organized as follows .",
    "the numerical data is briefly described in  [ sec_mhd ] .",
    "the synthesis procedure is detailed in  [ sec_spectra ] and includes two subsections : in  [ seeing ] we characterize the angular resolution of the model observations , and in  [ calibration ] we calibrate the synthetic magnetograms .",
    "the main results of the synthesis are analyzed in  [ sec_results ] : the variation of the apparent flux of the region depending on the sensitivity and spatial resolution of the observation (  [ flux_density ] ) , the asymmetries of the stokes @xmath0 profiles (  [ asym ] ) , and the magnetic broadening of the intensity profiles (  [ broadening ] ) .",
    "hanle depolarization signals to be expected for @xmath14607    are worked out in  [ hanle ] .",
    " [ telescope ] discusses the diameter of the ideal telescope needed to spatially resolve the simulations .",
    "finally , the implications of the present work are discussed in  [ conclusions ] .",
    "the numerical data set used in the present work is part of a series of numerical simulations to study the generation and interaction of magnetic fields with turbulent convection .",
    "the simulations are based on a idealized model describing a layer of incompressible ( boussinesq ) fluid with constant kinematic viscosity @xmath4 , thermal diffusivity @xmath5 and magnetic diffusivity @xmath6 .",
    "the boundary conditions are periodic in the horizontal directions , and impenetrable and stress free with constant temperature and zero horizontal magnetic field along the upper and lower boundaries of the computational domain .",
    "as is common in this kind of simulations , the unit of length is the vertical extent of the layer , the unit of time is the thermal diffusion time across that layer and the magnetic intensity is expressed as an equivalent alfvn speed . with these units the particular dynamo solutions used below is defined by the following dimensionless parameters : aspect - ratio of the computational domain @xmath7 , rayleigh number @xmath8 and prandtl numbers @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "the numerical resolution was @xmath11 collocation points .",
    "in this regime , the solution corresponds to a state of vigorous convective turbulence characterized by a kinetic and magnetic reynolds numbers of @xmath12 @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the resulting flow is strongly chaotic and acts as an efficient dynamo generating an intermittent magnetic field with no mean flux and a magnetic energy roughly 20% of the kinetic energy . for the present study ,",
    "we use one time step of the dynamo evolution that is well into the statistically stationary regime . at this epoch",
    ", the rms velocity of the fluid is @xmath14 with a corresponding turnover time . ] of @xmath15",
    ". a more complete description of the simulation procedure , and further details about the numerical solutions can be found in @xcite ( @xcite ) , @xcite ( @xcite ) and @xcite ( @xcite ) .",
    "the numerical simulations described above were not designed specifically for spectral synthesis , rather to study dynamo action . in order to achieve the high magnetic reynolds numbers ( @xmath16 ) necessary for dynamo action to manifest itself , and given finite computer resources ( @xmath17@xmath18 grid points ) , we found it necessary to resort to the boussinesq approximation .",
    "the latter is valid provided that the vertical extent of the layer is much smaller than the pressure , density , and temperature scale heights ( see e.g. @xcite @xcite ) . as a consequence , the thermodynamic variables from the numerical solutions have modest variations across the layer , and can not be used to calculate the opacity and source functions needed for the synthesis .",
    "consequently , we address the synthesis problem ignoring the thermodynamic variables from the simulations , but keeping the variations in the velocity ( @xmath19 ) and magnetic field ( @xmath20 ) . although @xmath19 and @xmath20 are then decoupled from the density and temperature distributions , the resulting synthetic profiles are useful to study the properties of the emerging line polarization that depends , primarily , on the magnetic and velocity structure . in the remainder of this section",
    "we explain the process followed to generate the synthetic profiles .",
    "the first step is to translate the dimensionless velocity and magnetic data of the simulations into units that are practical for the synthesis .",
    "the spatial scale is fixed by assuming that the typical size of one granule is about 1000 km . in the statistically stationary regime",
    "the computational domain is about 5 granules wide .",
    "thus the horizontal size of the domain corresponds to 5000 km , with a corresponding grid resolution of approximately @xmath21  km in the horizontal , and @xmath22  km in the vertical . magnetic field strengths @xmath23 and velocities @xmath3 readily follow from the energy equipartition arguments .",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath3 are proportional to the dimensionless magnetic strength @xmath24 and velocity @xmath25 through the factors @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath28 equipartition between kinetic energy density and magnetic energy density is reached in dimensionless units when @xmath29 or equivalently when @xmath30 @xmath31 being the density . the previous equation , together with equations ( [ scl0 ] ) and ( [ scl1 ] ) , lead to @xmath32 thus ,",
    "if one associates the rms speed @xmath33 with the rms velocity fluctuations observed in the solar granulation @xmath34 km s@xmath35 ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) , then @xmath36 and for a typical density at the base of the photosphere ( 3 @xmath37 g @xmath38 ; @xcite @xcite ) , equations ( [ scl2 ] ) and ( [ scl3 ] ) render @xmath39 except for a few exploratory calculations described in  [ asym ] and  [ hanle ] , the scaling factors in equations ( [ scl3 ] ) and ( [ scl4 ] ) are used for the rest of the work . notice that reasonable deviations from this scaling do no affect our results in a substantial way ( a point addressed in ",
    "[ sec_results ] ) .",
    "following our previous assumption , the absorption and emission terms of the radiative transfer equations ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) are not based on the thermodynamic variables of the numerical data set .",
    "instead , we resort to a milne - eddington ( me ) synthesis which assumes a constant line absorption and a linear source function ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the me assumption is routinely used for magnetic field diagnostics ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ) since it yields an analytic expression for the emerging polarized spectrum that only depends on a few parameters .",
    "the analytic solution is used to fit observed spectra and retrieve information from them ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the me synthesis hides all the unknown thermodynamic properties of the atmosphere in five parameters , namely , the line absorption coefficient , two parameters that define the ( linear ) source function , the damping coefficient , and the doppler width . in our syntheses",
    ", we adopt the values characteristic of the line at @xmath16302.5   in the quiet sun ( @xcite @xcite , table 1 , including a doppler width of 40 m  or 1.9 km s@xmath35 ) .",
    "this magnetically sensitive spectral line is often used for magnetic studies , including those of the advanced stokes polarimeter ( @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "working with the same line allows us to compare our results directly with its observations .",
    "the use of observed me thermodynamic parameters to represent the synthetic line provides realism to the part of the synthesis that we do not obtain directly from the numerical simulation .",
    "the emerging spectra will have the observed equivalent widths , line widths , etc agrees with those derived from real solar spectra .",
    "second , the mean equivalent width of our synthetic intensity profiles is 71 m , i.e. , close to the value observed in the quiet sun ( some  80  m ; e.g. , @xcite @xcite ) . ] .",
    "the standard me assumption considers an atmosphere having a uniform magnetic field ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "such assumption is clearly at odds with our numerical data in which the magnetic diffusive scale is of the order of @xmath40  km @xmath41  km , i.e. , three grid points in the vertical direction .",
    "the field is therefore not constant over the range of heights where the typical photospheric lines are formed ( say 100 km ) .",
    "a realistic spectral line synthesis would have to take into account the contributions from many layers in the simulation .",
    "the brute - force approach would be to assign an optical depth to each horizontal plane in the simulation and then synthesizing the spectrum by direct numerical integration of the radiative transfer equations for polarized light . here ,",
    "instead , we resort to a different strategy that a ) is simpler and much faster , b ) reduces the number of free parameters of the synthesis ( no need to specify the optical depths of all the different planes of the atmosphere ) and , c ) produces spectra very close to those obtained by the brute - force approach .",
    "we employ a multi - component me atmosphere , as defined by @xcite ( @xcite ;  2.1 ) .",
    "we assume that not all individual planes of the simulation contribute to the emerging spectrum , and consider only a sub - set whose thickness is of the order of the photon mean - free - path .",
    "we take into account that the planes are optically thin so that the emerging spectrum depends only on the average along the line - of - sight  of the emission and the absorption ( the so - called misma approximation ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "as argued below , these assumptions are not unreasonable , and reduce the radiative transfer calculation to deciding how many planes contribute to the emerging spectrum .",
    "subsequently , the average absorption matrix is computed , and used jointly with the analytic solution for the regular me synthesis ( @xcite @xcite ) .    in our case",
    "we choose the 21 uppermost planes of the simulation , excluding the upper boundary . according to the scaling described in the previous paragraph ,",
    "this corresponds to approximately 100 km in the atmosphere , a typical range for the formation of a photospheric line .",
    "we further assume that the numerical simulation is placed at disk center , i.e. , with the line - of - sight   along the vertical direction .",
    "since the individual planes of the simulation are indeed optically thin ( 5 km ) , using the average emission and absorption instead of solving the full radiative transfer should be a good approximation .",
    "we checked this assumption by comparing spectra computed by direct integration of the radiative transfer equation with those resulting from our approximation .",
    "figure [ full_vs_misma ] contains one example .",
    "the full synthesis is performed assuming the 21 different planes of the me synthesis to be equi - spaced in and spanning from @xmath42 to @xmath43 .",
    "( the symbol @xmath44 stands for the continuum optical depth . )",
    "this layer is periodically repeated to complete the atmosphere from @xmath45 to @xmath46 .",
    "the synthesis of 1000 randomly chosen spectra shows relative differences between the two kinds of syntheses of only a few per cent .",
    "this deviation is negligible for the analysis that we carry out in the present work .",
    "the choice of number of planes to be used for the spectral synthesis is a more delicate matter . using 26 instead of 21 planes",
    "we find differences between spectra of up to 25% .",
    "these differences are due to the strong variability of the magnetic conditions , an uncertainty that also affects any other way of synthesizing the spectra . for example , in the case of the brute - force approach the signals depend on the optical depths arbitrarily assigned to each plane of the numerical data .      studying the consequences of observing the simulations with a finite spatial resolution is one of the key objectives of the present work .",
    "we use the term _ seeing _ to denote all the effects that may reduce the spatial resolution ( from genuine seeing to optical aberrations of the instruments ) . here the effects of seeing are modeled by smearing the 2d maps of the stokes profiles with gaussian functions . note that the 2d convolution is carried out at each individual wavelength of each stokes parameter .",
    "the amount of smearing is characterized by the fwhm ( full width half maximum ) of the gaussian function .",
    "we take this particular point spread function for the sake of simplicity , however , it accurately describes long - integration - time atmospheric seeing ( e.g , @xcite @xcite ,  4.5 ) . in one of the sections (  [ telescope ] ) , we measure seeing in terms of the diameter , @xmath47 , of an ideal telescope that provides a given angular resolution . considering that the airy disk of an ideal telescope has a fwhm @xmath48 , then @xmath49 where fwhm is expressed in km and @xmath1 in  .",
    "we have used a scale of 725 km/ , corresponding to our target at 1 au .",
    "longitudinal magnetograms are images showing the degree of circular polarization in the flank of a spectral line ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "they can be produced using relatively simple and compact instruments and therefore have been widely used in solar magnetic field studies .",
    "a significant fraction of what we know about quiet sun magnetic fields has been derived from them ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "longitudinal magnetograms are usually calibrated in units of magnetic field strength ( g ) .",
    "since we wish to compare the polarization signals with observed magnetograms , calibrated magnetograms must be prepared out of the synthetic stokes profiles .",
    "we follow a procedure that mimics the observational process .",
    "first , the circular polarization signals are averaged in wavelength , this is because magnetograms are often obtained through a rather broad color filter .",
    "we employ a running box filter , 100 m  wide , centered in the blue wing of the line at 50 m  from the line center .",
    "( these values are comparable to those employed in real measurements ; e.g. , @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite . )",
    "then the wavelength averaged circular polarization signal @xmath50 is calibrated to yield the so - called longitudinal magnetic flux density @xmath51 , i.e. , @xmath52 the calibration constant @xmath53 is evaluated using the magnetograph equation and the properties of the line in which the magnetograph operates ; explicitly , @xmath54 here , the symbol @xmath55 stands for the central wavelength of the line , @xmath56 is the effective land factor , and @xmath57 corresponds to the intensity profile smeared with the same color filter used to produce @xmath58 .",
    "the constant @xmath59 equals 4.67  @xmath60  @xmath35  g@xmath35 . for the atomic parameters of @xmath16302.5  , and using the mean stokes @xmath61 profile over a complete snapshot ,",
    "we find @xmath62  g when @xmath58 is given in units of the continuum intensity .",
    "this synthetic calibration constant is in good agreement with the values that can be found in the literature for this line ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .    with several additional simplifying assumptions independent of the magnetic field , and others ; see , e.g. , @xcite ( @xcite ) ; @xcite ( @xcite ) .",
    "] , it can be shown that @xmath63 where the integrals extend to the resolution element @xmath64 , and @xmath65 is the component of the magnetic field vector pointing towards the observer .",
    "this identity provides the rationale to denote magnetogram signals as _",
    "longitudinal magnetic flux densities_. ( according to equation [ [ theory ] ] , @xmath51 represents the magnetic flux per unit area . )",
    "in this section we analyze the synthesis of the 512 @xmath66 512 stokes spectra calculated from the dynamo simulation described in  [ sec_mhd ] .",
    "we only use the numerical solution at one instant since the purpose of the work is to study the kind of spectra characterizing the stationary state of the simulation ( studies of the time dependent behavior is deferred for later ) .",
    "we place the simulation at the solar disk center so that the vertical direction follows the line - of - sight .",
    "figure [ magneto ] shows the magnetogram that results when applying equation ( [ bruteforce ] ) to the synthetic stokes @xmath0 spectra ( right panel ) .",
    "the effect of observing with a 05 seeing  representative of the best angular resolution achieved at present ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ) , is also shown on the left panel .",
    "ignoring the underlying substructure , an observer would identify a number of magnetic concentrations in the smeared magnetogram ( e.g. , points @xmath67 , @xmath24 and @xmath59 ) .",
    "however , these are difficult to associate with single structures once the underlying substructure is acknowledged .",
    "rather , the points with enhanced signal in the 05 magnetogram represent locations where the convective flows are continuously advecting magnetized plasma to balance the plasma that constantly disappears in the downdrafts ( see also   3.2 in @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the fact that the residual polarization signal shows up suggests the presence of a large - scale structure of the advecting velocity .",
    "indeed , detailed analysis of the numerical data reveals the existence of a mesogranular flow ( @xcite @xcite ) .    except for a few test calculations in  [ asym ] ,",
    "the spectra discussed in this section correspond to a scaling of the dimensionless magnetic field and velocity given by equations ( [ scl3 ] ) and ( [ scl4 ] ) .",
    "however , syntheses using @xmath68 km s@xmath35 and @xmath69 g were also tried .",
    "we found that the degree of circular polarization increases linearly as @xmath27 , whereas a larger @xmath26 enhances the line asymmetries . on the other hand ,",
    "the kind of general trends and properties that we analyze here do not depend on the precise value of the scale factors .",
    "the amount of magnetic flux and energy in the numerical data is far larger than that detected in the sun as in fields .",
    "this difference can be understood as the result of two important factors that hinder the detection of the weak signals emerging from the simulation .",
    "first , the magnetic fields are highly disorganized so that the polarization signals tend to cancel as the angular resolution deteriorate ( @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "second , most synthetic signals are extremely low , i.e. at and below the sensitivity of the present instrumentation . consequently a large fraction could not be detected at present . in this section",
    "we use our synthetic lines to explore these effects .",
    "we find that once realistic angular resolution and sensitivity are taken into account , the simulations are in good agreement with the observations .",
    "figure [ mean ] shows the mean unsigned signal in the magnetogram of figure [ magneto ] as a function of the seeing ( i.e. , mean @xmath70 over the snapshot versus fwhm of seeing ) .",
    "we consider various sensitivities of the magnetograph : moderate ( 20 g ) , good ( 5 g ) and very good ( 0.5 g ) .",
    "we account for the limited sensitivity by setting to zero all those points in the smeared magnetogram where the signal is below the hypothetical observational threshold . figures [ mean]b is identical to figure [ mean]a except that it has been normalized to the mean longitudinal field in the simulation ( i.e. , mean @xmath71  g , where the average considers all the points of the simulation that we use ) .",
    "according to the standard interpretation ( equation [ [ theory ] ] ) , this is the parameter that one retrieves from a magnetogram .",
    "the normalization helps visualizing the fraction of real signal that remains in the magnetogram for a given angular resolution and sensitivity .",
    "there are several features in these two figures that deserve comment .",
    "even with perfect sensitivity and maximum angular resolution , one detects only 80  % of the existing flux .",
    "the cancellation is mostly due to the averaging along the line - of - sight caused by the radiative transfer . at maximum angular resolution",
    ", the flux in the magnetogram depends little on the sensitivity since most of the signals exceed 20  g.    the decrease in signal strength as the angular resolution deteriorate is severe .",
    "for the typical 1angular resolution , the detectable signals are only 10 % of the original ones ( fig .",
    "[ mean]b ) .",
    "this estimate is optimistic since it holds true if the sensitivity is good ; should the latter be moderate , only traces of the original signals remain ( 1% for 20 g sensitivity ) .",
    "figure [ mean]a includes values for solar in magnetic flux densities observed by various authors .",
    "the level of detected flux density agrees well with the predictions of the simulations once the angular resolution has been taken into account .",
    "note that the observed flux densities are more than a factor of ten smaller than the signals in the original magnetogram .",
    "we should not overemphasize the agreement , since the observational points are rather uncertain ( they come from inhomogeneous sources , with different sensitivities and based on disparate techniques : see below ) .",
    "however , two conclusions can be drawn .",
    "first , intense yet tangled magnetic fields like those in the numerical simulation are compatible with the present solar observations .",
    "second , if our spatially fully resolved synthetic spectra were emitted by the sun , they would produce the degree of polarization that we detect on the sun with the present instrumentation .",
    "the observations presented in figure [ mean]a required transformation from the numbers quoted in the original works to the quantities plotted in the figure . here",
    "we briefly describe these transformations for the sake of completeness .",
    "( the symbols accompanying the citations correspond to those used in fig .",
    "[ mean]a . )",
    "@xcite  ( @xcite ; bullet sign @xmath72 ) deduce 10 g mean flux density for the quiet sun fields , however , they mention that the apparent flux density decreases by a factor 2.4 if it is estimated from magnetograms .",
    "this renders 4.2 g for a 1  angular resolution , a figure derived from the cut off frequency in the fourier domain of the continuum intensity image ( @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the same procedure is used to estimate the angular resolution of the spectra in @xcite  ( @xcite ; square @xmath73 ) . the mean flux density , 3.4 g , has been directly provided by the author .",

    "@xcite  ( @xcite ; triangle @xmath75 ) do not directly give a mean flux density for their measurements .",
    "however , their figure 3 contains the magnetic fluxes of individual measurements , and the authors provide the scale factor between the magnetic flux and the magnetic flux density ( @xmath76 mx g@xmath35 ) . with this conversion ,",
    "the mean flux density of these observations is about 4 g. the magnetic features occupy 68 % of the surface , since the rest remains below the sensitivity threshold .",
    "consequently , the mean flux density over the whole surface results 0.68  @xmath77  g. @xcite  ( @xcite , fig . 1 ; plus sign @xmath78 ) provide the distribution of stokes @xmath0 @xmath15250    signals found in the quiet sun , being the average signal about @xmath79 ( in units of the continuum intensity ) .",
    "the authors also point out a calibration constant from stokes @xmath0 signal to flux density .",
    "it gives 2 g for the mean observed signal .",
    "since these signals fill 40% of the solar surface , the mean flux density is about 0.8 g. we assign to these data an angular resolution twice the sampling interval ( some 23 ) .",

    "well defined symmetries ( see  [ sec_introduction ] ) .",
    "this kind of symmetries are never found in the quiet sun , instead profiles frequently show extreme asymmetries ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "because the magnetic field in the numerical simulation has a highly intermittent structure ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) , we expected the resulting synthetic stokes profiles to be asymmetric . in the following ,",
    "we compare our synthetic profiles with observed ones and study in a statistical sense their differences and similarities .",
    "we proceed by first classifying the types of stokes @xmath0 profiles produced by the simulation .",
    "the @xmath81 stokes @xmath0 profiles in the snapshot were assorted using a cluster analysis algorithm identical to that employed with real data by @xcite ( @xcite ;  3.2 ) .",
    "the procedure identifies and groups profiles with similar shape , irrespective of their degree of polarization and polarity , since it employs stokes @xmath0 profiles normalized to the largest blue peak ( see @xcite @xcite for details ) .",
    "the classification is summarized in figure [ vasym0 ] . for each different class , the averaged stokes @xmath0",
    "profile over the ensemble is plotted .",
    "the mean is taken after each individual profile has been multiplied by the sign of its largest blue peak .",
    "this avoids cancellation of different polarities .",
    "the mean profiles are numbered ( upper left corner in each panel ) according to the percentage of profiles in the simulation that are elements of their class , with # 0 being the most probable and # 17 the least probable . the probability to find a profile of a given class",
    "is indicated in the upper right corner of each panel .",
    "note the various possibilities . from virtually anti -",
    "symmetric stokes @xmath0 ( implying no asymmetry ) , to profiles with one ( e.g. , # 11 and # 13 ) or three lobes ( e.g. , # 12 and # 14 ) .",
    "all these asymmetries are produced by gradients of magnetic and velocity fields along the line - of - sight .",
    "the peak polarization is considerable , some 1% in units of the continuum intensity .",
    "this has to be the case to yield the large flux density shown in figure [ mean]a for perfect angular resolution .",
    "another detail worthwhile noting is the balance between the number of profiles having a large blue lobe and those whose principal lobe is the red one .",
    "the line shapes in figure [ vasym0 ] are difficult to compare with observed profiles since observations of the quiet sun have much lower angular resolution .",
    "figure [ vasym1 ] shows another classification having all the features explained above , except that the simulation data have been smeared with a 1  seeing , typical of the real observations .",
    "first , the polarization signals are reduced by one order of magnitude with respect to the original profiles ; compare them with those in figure [ vasym0 ] .",
    "second , new more complicated line shapes have arisen as the result of the large spatial smearing ( radiative transfer smoothes over only 100 km , whereas the spatial smearing does it over 725 @xmath66 725 km@xmath82 ) . stokes profiles having all these very asymmetric shapes are indeed observed in the real quiet sun ( see @xcite @xcite , fig .",

    "this qualitative agreement is again a notable feature of the simulation , since there was no obvious a priori reason to expect it .",
    "however , despite such general qualitative agreement , one can find quantitative differences between the synthetic and the observed profiles . as it happens with the fully resolved profiles ( fig .",
    "[ vasym0 ] ) , the number of synthetic profiles having a principal blue lobe and those with a principal red lobe is similar ( e.g. , the pairs # 12 and # 18 ; # 31 and # 34 ; # 33 and # 35 ) . such balance is not present among the observed profiles , where the blue lobe usually dominates ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite , fig . 4 ; @xcite @xcite , fig .",
    "another qualitative difference with observations concerns the profiles that are most frequently obtained in the simulation .",
    "they show almost no asymmetry ( see classes # 0 to # 7 ) .",
    "contrariwise , the observational counterpart have a well defined asymmetry characterized by a large blue lobe ( similar to those observed in plage and enhanced network regions ) .",
    "this lack of significant asymmetry can be traced back to the original syntheses ( fig .",
    "[ vasym0 ] , classes # 0 to # 4 ) , and therefore to the variations along the line - of - sight  of the magnetic field and velocity .",
    "the probable cause is discussed in the next paragraph .",
    "figure [ brms ] summarizes the kind of variations along the line - of - sight   existing in the numerical simulation .",

    "we should bear in mind that the line - of - sight  averages defined in equations ( [ stat2 ] ) depend on the horizontal coordinates .",
    "we need to characterize the typical properties of these line - of - sight  mean values for each range of mean longitudinal magnetic field strength . for this purpose",
    "we define the average @xmath95 and the dispersion @xmath96 of the quantity @xmath97 among all those points in the simulation with a given line - of - sight  mean longitudinal magnetic field @xmath98 , i.e. , @xmath99 @xmath100^{1/2},\\ ] ] with @xmath101 and @xmath102 note that the symbol @xmath97 may represent any of the statistical parameters in equation ( [ stat2 ] ) ( @xmath103 , @xmath104 or @xmath105 ) , and @xmath106 and @xmath107 correspond to the grid points in the two horizontal directions .",
    "the bin size @xmath108 has to be chosen to guarantee having enough points per bin .",
    "following these definitions , we can now interpret figure [ brms ] .",
    "the different quantities represented are plotted as function of the line - of - sight mean magnetic field .",
    "the first panel in figure  [ brms ] shows the variation of @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "the limited dispersion of the vertical velocities provides an explanation for the predominance of profiles with small asymmetries .",
    "the dispersion must be of the order of the line width to produce a substantial modification of the line shape .",
    "the typical standard deviation of the vertical velocities along the line - of - sightturns out to be between 0.2 and 0.3 km s@xmath35 ( @xmath110 , fig .",
    "[ brms]a , the solid line ) , whereas the line widths are of the order of 2 km s@xmath35 ( see  [ sec_spectra ] ) .",
    "the magnetic field itself is probably not responsible for the moderate asymmetries since its variations along the line - of - sight  are large .",
    "for example , figure [ brms]b shows the standard deviation of the mean longitudinal magnetic field @xmath111 , which is frequently larger than the absolute value of @xmath112 . in fact , the variations of the longitudinal magnetic fields are so important that @xmath65 very often changes sign along the line - of - sight(fig .",
    "[ brms]c ) .",
    "note that none of these statements on large magnetic field gradients apply to the intrinsically strong fields , a case discussed separately in the next paragraph .",
    "above , say , 200 g , the variations of field strength are mild and the longitudinal field maintains a constant sign along the line - of - sight  ( figs .",
    "[ brms]b and [ brms]c ) . concerning the balance between the number of asymmetries towards the blue and towards the red in figures [ vasym0 ] and [ vasym1 ] , it is probably due to the lack of a definite sign for the correlation between magnetic field and velocity .",
    "works on the asymmetries in plage and network regions repeatedly indicate the need for a negative correlation to account for the observed preponderance of the stokes @xmath0 blue lobe , explicitly , @xmath113 ( see , e.g. , @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "such condition is satisfied when downflows and magnetic fields are spatially separated , i.e. , when the strongest downflows tend to occur in weakly magnetized plasma .",

    "one can see in figure [ brms]d that the correlation between @xmath115 and @xmath116 has a well defined negative value only for the largest field strengths .",
    "since theses points represent a small fraction of the synthetic profiles , they contribute very little to the classification in figure [ vasym0 ] which , consequently , shows no obvious preference for a blue asymmetry .    those patches in the simulation with the largest field strength show a clear negative correlation fulfilling the criterion in equation ( [ correlation2 ] ) ( see fig .",
    "[ brms]d ) .",
    "do they produce the observed stokes @xmath0 profiles with a main blue lobe ?",
    "they do not , since the asymmetry of the profiles emerging from concentrations of intense field strength are minimal .",
    "this fact can be understood using figures [ brms]a and [ brms]b , which reveal gradients of both magnetic field and velocity too small for the requirements described in the previous paragraph . despite this apparent disagreement ,",
    "the key ingredients to yield the right shapes are already present in the simulation .",
    "if one artificially increases the gradients of magnetic field and velocity already existing in the simulation , large asymmetries similar to the observed ones automatically show up .",

    "in addition , we increased the variations of magnetic field strength by averaging all the absorption and emission over 05 of the simulation ( i.e. , over all the points in a box of this size ) .",
    "the qualitative agreement between synthetic and real profiles is remarkable .",
    "the above considerations lead to an interesting question .",
    "how should the numerical simulations be modified in order to produce asymmetries closer to the observed ones ?",
    "first , the dispersion of velocities at the smallest scales must be increased , which implies a decrease in the kinematic viscosity .",
    "second , magnetic and non - magnetic regions should be even more intermittent to strengthen the correlation ( [ correlation2 ] )",
    ". this can be achieved by decreasing the magnetic diffusivity , which would both increase the tangling of magnetic field lines and the dispersion of field strengths existing in the intense concentrations .",
    "one of the observational constraints on the existence of a complex and tangled magnetic field in the solar photosphere comes from the work by @xcite ( @xcite ) ( see also @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) . if a tangled magnetic field exist , it has to broaden the spectral lines of the solar spectrum according to their magnetic sensitivities ( i.e. , according to their effective land factors ) .",
    "all other things being the same , those with larger sensitivity should be slightly broader .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite ) looked for such effect in the solar unpolarized spectrum with no success . from the error budget of the measurement the authors set an upper limit to the field strength of the existing fields ( @xcite @xcite , equation [ 12 ] ) , @xmath118 in this section we analyze if the magnetic fields in the simulations produce line broadenings compatible with such observational upper limit .",
    "this exercise allows to address the question of whether magnetic fields as intense as those in the simulation may exist on the sun , and still remain below the present observational detection limit .",
    "we already know that the degree of circular polarization of the simulation stays well within the observational bounds (  [ flux_density ] ) . here",
    "we address the question from a different perspective , using a totally different observational constrain that depends on the magnetic fields in a intrinsically different way .",
    "our synthetic stokes @xmath61 spectra have an excess of broadening caused by the presence of magnetic fields .",
    "figure [ dif ] shows the difference between the mean stokes @xmath61 profile produced by the region , and the mean profile produced when the syntheses are repeated with no magnetic field , but keeping everything else identical . the magnetic profile is broader and shallower at the line center , producing a residual with three lobes .",
    "is this extra broadening compatible with the observational limit ( [ limit ] ) ?",
    "a detailed modeling of the procedure employed by @xcite ( @xcite ) is clearly beyond our possibilities , since it requires the synthesis of hundreds of spectral lines with different temperature and magnetic field sensitivities .",
    "fortunately , the essence of the procedure is simple .",
    "if two lines are identical except for their magnetic sensitivity , the small excess of width @xmath119 can be directly related to an _ apparent _ magnetic field strength @xmath120 according to the rule , @xmath121 the scale factor @xmath122 depends of the wavelength , the difference of land factor , and the mean line width @xmath123 . for two lines with the wavelength and strength of @xmath16302.5   , one magnetic and another one non - magnetic",

[ dif ] ) .",
    "the field strength of our synthetic profiles ( equation [ [ limit2 ] ] ) apparently come into conflict with the observational limit in equation ( [ limit ] ) .",
    "should the inconsistency be real , it points out an excess of magnetic fields in the numerical simulations as compared to the solar case ( an excess of magnetic field strength , area coverage of the fields , etc . ) .",
    "however , the marginal discrepancy is probably not significant in view of the uncertainties affecting both the syntheses and the observational limit .",
    "actually , the similarity between the observational limit and the predicted width should be understood as real chance to test whether complex tangled fields like those in the numerical simulations are present in the solar photosphere .",
    "a slight refinement of the currently available diagnostic tools ( e.g. , stenflo & lindegren s technique ) should be able unambiguously to confirm them or discard them .",
    "we return to this point in  [ conclusions ] .",

    "however , solar turbulent magnetic fields have been inferred using hanle effect signals .",
    "they indicate the presence of turbulent magnetic fields in the upper photosphere - lower chromosphere with a field strength between 5 and 60 g ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "these strengths may seem too low compared to those assumed in this work , with a mean value larger than 100 g ( e.g. ,  [ broadening ] ) .",
    "therefore , we felt compelled to estimate the hanle signals expected from the dynamo simulation and compare them with observed values .",
    "once more we face the question of whether magnetic fields similar to those in the simulations may exist and still produce observable effects within solar values .",
    "a complete hanle effect synthesis similar to that carried out for the zeeman effect is clearly beyond the scope of this paper .",

    "the relationship ( [ hanle1 ] ) is an approximation which works well for this particular line in standard quiet sun model atmospheres ( see @xcite @xcite , where one can also find the dependence of @xmath135 on the density and temperature of the atmosphere ) . for additional details",

    "the mean signal will always be biased towards weak field strengths ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite , fig .",

    "we only consider the photospheric layers .",
    "the expected signals , including all the magnetic fields in the snapshot describing the distribution of @xmath23 , are represented in figure [ hanle_fig ] .",

    "the observational signal has been chosen to be as close as possible to the disk center to sample deep photospheric layers .",
    "the measurement of depolarization is ascribed by @xcite ( @xcite ) to a range of heights between 200 km and 400 km .",
    "although these layers are still too high for the range of heights that we assign to the simulation in the zeeman syntheses ( the base of the photosphere ) , the depolarization turns out to be within the bounds set by observations ( see fig .",
    "[ hanle_fig ] , the solid line ) .",
    "the agreement improves taking into account that the turbulent field strengths are expected to decrease with height in the atmosphere ( e.g. @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the dashed line in figure [ hanle_fig ] has been computed assuming the field strengths to be a factor of two smaller than those in the original snapshot . in short ,",

    "answering this question may be relevant to design of the next generation solar telescopes ( rosner & beckers , 2001 , private communication ) .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we adopt the magnetic flux as the physical parameter to be determined . it is routinely measured using standard instrumentation , and it suffers a severe bias due to insufficient spatial resolution (  [ flux_density ] ) . the fraction of magnetic flux in the simulation that one still detects in synthetic magnetograms is used to quantify the required angular resolution .",
    "this information is contained in figure [ mean]b , which we plot in a slightly different way in figure [ teles_diam ] .",

    "one only detects 80  % of the existing flux .",
    "the residual 20  % cancellation is due to the smearing along the line - of - sight produced by the radiative transfer . surpassing this upper limit is not a question of increasing the telescope size but rather it demands improving the diagnostic techniques used to measure the magnetic flux .",
    "2 .   detecting 50  % of the flux would require an angular resolution of 110  km or a telescope of 85  cm .",
    "detecting another 20  % additional magnetic flux demands resolving 40  km and so a telescope some three times larger ( 2.3  m ) .",
    "points  # 1 and # 2 refer to observations without noise . if one considers a detection threshold of 20  g ( which corresponds to a degree of polarization of some 0.3  % , according to the calibration in ",
    "[ calibration ] ) , then only 70  % of the flux present in the simulation can be detected .",
    "on the other hand detecting 50  % implies an angular resolution of 70  km or a diameter of @xmath143  1.3  m. 4 .",
    "the slope of the solid line in figure [ teles_diam ] drastically changes when trying to detect more than , say , 65  % of the original flux .",
    "going beyond this point requires a large increase of telescope diameter for a limited increase of additional signal .",
    "this 65  % may represent an optimal compromise between resolution and telescope size , and it corresponds to 60  km on the sun or a diameter of 1.5  m.",
    "the dynamo simulation by @xcite ( @xcite ) ( see also @xcite @xcite ) produce magnetic fields whose structure resembles in many ways the quiet sun magnetic fields (  [ sec_introduction ] ) .",
    "although the simulations were not designed for a realistic description of the solar conditions , the quantitative comparison with the quiet sun that we undertake is useful for a variety of reasons .",
    "it allows to judge whether , and to what extent , the turbulent dynamo provides a paradigm to describe the quiet sun magnetism .",
    "it allows to identify , study and understand the difficulties and biases faced by the current observational techniques when applied to very complex fields .",

    "more than 90 % of the unsigned magnetic flux existing in the numerical data does not appear in magnetograms with 1angular resolution ( fig .",

    "the stokes @xmath0 profiles emerging from the simulation are frequently very asymmetric , in qualitative agreement with observations ( see references in  [ sec_introduction ] ) .",
    "in particular , stokes @xmath0 profiles with three and more lobes result from the existence of two opposite polarities in the resolution element .",
    "part of these asymmetries are produced by gradients of magnetic field and velocity along the line - of - sight(fig .",
    "[ vasym0 ] ) , but the stokes @xmath0 profiles also owe much of their shapes to variations across the line - of - sightwithin the resolution element ( cf . figs . [ vasym0 ] and [ vasym1 ] ) .",

    "a quantitative analysis of the stokes @xmath0 asymmetries reveals real discrepancies between the synthetic spectra and the quiet sun .",
    "most of the synthetic profiles show mild asymmetries , well below the mean observed values . moreover",
    ", the synthetic spectra do not contain the clear observed tendency for the stokes @xmath0 blue lobe to dominate .",
    "such trend is present even in the largest polarization signals , which trace big concentrations of magnetic field .",
    "we believe that the cause of the discrepancy is twofold .",
    "first , the dispersion of velocities between nearby pixels is too small .",
    "second , the spatial separation between strongly magnetized and unmagnetized plasmas is too large .",
    "these two factors minimize the asymmetries in the intergranular lanes , despite the fact that the kind of correlation between magnetic field and velocity already existing in the simulation produces the right asymmetry .",
    "arguments for such explanation are given in  [ asym ] .",
    "as a support of this view , we artificially increase the dispersion of velocities and magnetic fields existing in the simulation to synthesize spectra in three particularly large magnetic concentrations .",
    "the resulting stokes @xmath0 profiles look very much like those observed in the quiet sun network ( synthetic and observed profiles are represented in fig . [ net_like ] ) .",
    "if we have correctly identified the origin of the differences , what must be modified in the numerical simulation in order to produce asymmetries closer to the observed ones ?",
    "one would need to increase the dispersion of velocities and magnetic fields at the smallest spatial scales , keeping the relationship between them already existing in the simulation .",
    "this could be attained by increasing the reynolds numbers of the simulations .",
    "there is another discrepancy between the synthetic and the observed profiles which has not been mentioned yet .",
    "the analysis of stokes @xmath0 shapes observed in the quiet sun reveals that kg field strengths are common ( see @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "there are also weaker fields ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) , but the frequency of kg is certainly larger than that present in the simulation .",
    "this difference can be readily pin down to the incompressibility of the simulation (  [ sec_mhd ] ) , which hampers the strong evacuation of the plasma , an ingredient always associated with the existence of kg fields in the photosphere .",
    "we have found several similarities between the synthetic spectra emerging from the dynamo simulation and observations of quiet sun magnetic fields .",
    "such ( sometimes unexpected ) agreement seems to point out that the simulation already capture some of the essential features characterizing the quiet sun magnetic fields .",
    "these arguments enables us to proceed by analogy and propose the existence of magnetic fields on the sun similar to those in the numerical simulations .",
    "several interesting consequences follow from this assumption :    1 .",
    "the amount of flux inferred by conventional magnetograms depends very much on the angular resolution and the sensitivity of the measurements .",
    "good or very good sensitivity is mandatory to detect any fluxes with the canonical 1angular resolution .",
    "for example , the structures in the numerical simulation would be very difficult to detect in magnetograms like those provided by the mdi instrument on board the soho spacecraft , with a sensitivity of some 15 g ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ) . according to figure [ mean]b ,",
    "only 1% of the original magnetic flux is detectable at this sensitivity level . on the other hand ,",
    "the sensitivity is not so critical upon improvement of the angular resolution . in the limit of perfect angular resolution the signals become of the order of 50 g , corresponding to a degree of circular polarization of 1% ( see fig . [ vasym0 ] ) .",
    "the amount of unsigned flux existing in the simulation is also very large in absolute terms . assuming that the full solar surface were covered by magnetic fields like those in the numerical simulations ,",
    "the associated total unsigned flux would be of the order of @xmath145  mx .",
    "this figure is a factor 4.5 times larger than the total flux detected at solar maximum with conventional techniques ( @xcite @xcite , fig .",
    "should such large amounts of hidden flux exist in the photosphere , it would have to interact with the other classical manifestations of the solar magnetism ( active regions , solar cycle , coronal heating , etc ) .",
    "this point in particular deserves further investigations .",
    "we discuss in  [ telescope ] the telescope size required to detect the magnetic structures observed in the simulations .",
    "this is a preliminary estimate which certainly has to be revised and refined .",
    "( for example , we do not address the question of whether the 60 km optimum spatial resolution is set by the photon mean - free - path or the diffusion processes included in the mhd simulation .",
    ") however one conclusion of this preliminary study stands out . a sizeable fraction of the magnetic flux is not detected due to the radiative transfer smearing along the line - of - sight .",
    "improving such bias is not a matter of increasing the telescope size and polarimetric sensitivity .",
    "it only depends on interpreting the observed polarization using techniques that account for the line - of - sight  smearing .",
    "keeping in mind the complexity of the fields ( e.g. , the longitudinal magnetic field almost always changes sign along the line - of - sight ; see fig .",
    "[ brms]c ) , the use of inversion techniques that assume optically thin fluctuations of the magnetic field seems to be a reliable selection ( e.g. , the misma inversion code in @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "4 .   the stokes asymmetries contain information on the magnetic structuring at spatial scales smaller than the resolution element , an information unique and valuable ( see  [ sec_introduction ] ) .",
    "the syntheses show that both variations along the line - of - sight  and across the line - of - sight  are responsible for the asymmetries .",
    "consequently , the inversion techniques aimed at understanding the origin of the asymmetries , and therefore at measuring the properties of the photospheric magnetic fields , have to incorporate the two aspects of the spatial variations .",
    "the importance of the above conclusions depends to some extent , on the degree of realism of the simulations .",
    "however , the tendencies that they imply are probably correct ; e.g. , the existence of large amounts of solar magnetic flux missing in conventional measurements , or the need for non - standard inversion techniques to determine the properties of the quiet sun magnetic fields .",
    "these problems are important enough to deserve a close follow - up .",
    "the interest to synthesize the spectra of turbulent dynamo simulators arose from conversations with t. bogdan back in 1998 . both r. rosner and",
    "j. beckers pointed out the importance of estimating the telescope size required to spatially resolve the simulation .",
    "thanks are due to f. kneer , f. stolpe , and m. collados for providing the flux densities cited in  [ flux_density ] , and to an anonymous referee for helpful comments .",
    "thanks are also due to j. stenflo for clarifications on the hanle effect based measurements of the turbulent magnetic field strength .",
    "discussions with r. manso and j. trujillo bueno were extremely helpful to elaborate  [ hanle ] .",
    "this work has been partly funded by the spanish ministry of science and technology , under projects aya2001 - 1649 and dges 95 - 0028-c .",
