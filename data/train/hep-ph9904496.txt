    "understanding the non  valence quark content of hadrons remains , despite a history spanning over two decades , a major theoretical challenge .",
    "the interest in non  valence physics derives mainly from the unique opportunities which it provides for new insights into quantum aspects of hadron structure beyond the naive and spectroscopically very successful quark model .",
    "important questions in this realm include  modifications of the qcd vacuum inside hadrons @xcite , the mechanism of flavor mixing and the origin of the ozi ",
    "rule @xcite , the structure of constituent quarks @xcite , and the role of gluons in the dynamics of the ( isoscalar ) strange  quark sea in the nucleon @xcite .    the strangeness distribution inside of the nucleon @xcite represents the most intensely studied example of a hadronic non  valence quark effect .",
    "currently the vector channel of this distribution , as described by the strange vector form factors , is a focus of experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite research . since systematic and model  independent approaches have still little predictive power for the nucleon s strangeness content ( as exemplified by studies in chiral perturbation theory @xcite and on the lattice @xcite ) , most previous and current theoretical analyses of the strangeness form factors were model  based .    among the first and most transparent models for the vector form factors were those which implement a kaon  cloud of the nucleon @xcite and thus complement pole dominance approaches @xcite . in kaon ",
    "cloud models the nucleon s strangeness distribution is generated by fluctuations of the `` bare '' ( i.e. nonstrange ) nucleon into kaon ",
    "hyperon intermediate states which are described by the corresponding one  loop feynman graphs @xcite .",
    "the two crucial assumptions underlying the loop model are 1 ) that the lightest valence  strangeness carrying intermediate states generate the dominant contribution to the strangeness content and hence give at least a rough estimate of its size , and 2 ) that rescattering ( i.e. multi  loop ) contributions are suppressed ( despite large couplings ) .    both of these assumptions have recently been challenged .",
    "a dispersive analysis on the basis of analytically continued @xmath3 scattering data demonstrated that rescattering corrections are important even at low momentum transfers , both to restore unitarity and to build up resonance strength in the @xmath4 meson region @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a study in an `` unquenched '' quark model found the contributions from higher  lying intermediate states ( up to surprisingly large invariant masses ) indispensable for the calculation of the strange quark distribution @xcite and prompted our collaborators and us to investigate these issues in a complementary hadronic one  loop model  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the original @xmath5 loops ( @xmath6 ) , we included the next higher  lying intermediate states , i.e. the @xmath7 pairs . in the first part of this",
    "study the corresponding loops were evaluated using bonn ",
    "jlich @xmath8 form factors ( see below ) ,  as in the original @xmath5 model .",
    "the results were discouraging : the @xmath0 contributions were found to be larger than those from the kaon loop , and their dispersive analysis indicated strong unitarity violations .",
    "the anomalously large and apparently unrealistic @xmath0 contributions could be traced to the large @xmath0 tensor couplings and , in particular , to the very large cutoff parameter of the @xmath9 form factor taken from the bonn ",
    "jlich potential model @xcite .",
    "since both the nijmegen potential @xcite and the forthcoming update of the bonn  jlich @xmath10 potential  @xcite find substantially smaller values for this cutoff , we feel that a detailed and quantitative analysis of  the cutoff ( and coupling ) dependence of the @xmath0 contributions ( covering the whole range of so far proposed values )  would be a useful contribution to the ongoing discussion @xcite of hadron loop model applications to nucleon strangeness .",
    "such an analysis is one of the main objectives of the present paper .",
    "furthermore , we will calculate and discuss the momentum dependence of the strange vector form factors in the loop model at low momentum transfers ( @xmath11 gev ) relevant for the present and planned measurements at mit - bates , tjnaf and mami .",
    "we begin by recapitulating the definition of the strange vector form factors , the pertinent features of the hadronic loop model @xcite , and its extension to additional intermediate states containing @xmath0 mesons @xcite .",
    "the focus of our investigations will be on the nucleon matrix element of the strangeness current , which is parametrized by two invariant amplitudes , the dirac and pauli strangeness form factors @xmath12 , @xmath13 u(p)\\ .\\ ] ] here @xmath14 denotes the nucleon spinor and @xmath15 , due to the absence of an overall strangeness charge of the nucleon .",
    "the leading nonvanishing moments of these form factors are the dirac and sachs ( square)strangeness radii @xmath16 as well as the strangeness magnetic moment @xmath17 ( the sachs radius is obtained from the electric sachs form factor @xmath18 and related to the dirac radius by @xmath19 . )",
    "as mentioned above , we have chosen a hadronic one  loop model containing @xmath20 and @xmath0 mesons as the dynamical framework for the calculation of these moments .",

    "jlich @xmath28 potential @xcite at the hadronic @xmath29 and @xmath8 ( @xmath30 ) vertices , which have the monopole form @xmath31 with meson momenta @xmath32 and the physical meson masses @xmath33 mev and @xmath34 mev @xcite .",
    "these form factors render all encountered loop integrals finite and reproduce the on  shell values of the mesonic couplings .",
    "the range of currently favored values for the couplings @xmath35 and cutoff parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 , as well as their impact on the strangeness observables , will be discussed below .",
    "since the non - locality of the meson - baryon form factors ( [ ff ] ) gives rise to vertex currents , gauge invariance was maintained in @xcite by introducing the photon field via minimal substitution in the momentum variable @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "( consequences of the non  uniqueness of this prescription are discussed in refs .",
    "the resulting nonlocal seagull vertices are given explicitly in @xcite .",
    "the diagonal couplings of @xmath38 to the strange mesons and baryons in the intermediate states are straightforwardly determined by current conservation , i.e. they are given by the net strangeness charge of the corresponding hadron .",
    "the situation is more complex for the non  diagonal ( i.e. spin  flipping ) coupling @xmath39 of the strange current to @xmath20 and @xmath0 , which is defined by the transition matrix element    @xmath40    ( where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are isospin indices and @xmath43 is the polarization vector of the @xmath0 ) .",
    "this coupling was estimated in @xcite on the basis of the vector meson dominance model of ref .",
    "@xcite , with the result @xmath44 .",
    "the relevant one  loop feynman graphs of the model are completely determined by the above vertices and the standard meson and baryon propagators . the diagrams containing strange mesons fall into three categories , corresponding to fluctuations of the nucleon into either @xmath5 or @xmath7 pairs , or to the strangeness  current induced spin flip transition from a @xmath5 to a @xmath7 intermediate state .",
    "the explicit expressions for the corresponding loop amplitudes are collected in appendix a. in the following calculations we will concentrate on the @xmath45 contributions and omit the comparatively negligible @xmath46 contribution @xcite .",
    "in this section we investigate the dependence of the loop - model results on the couplings and cutoffs which parametrize the internal @xmath47 vertices . in our previous analysis",
    "@xcite we have used the ( @xmath48 based ) couplings @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and the cutoff parameter values @xmath52 ( 2.1 ) , @xmath53 gev of the bonn ",
    "jlich @xmath10 potential @xcite .",
    "the cutoffs were determined from hyperon ",
    "nucleon scattering data , with the numbers in parenthesis denoting values obtained in an alternative model for the baryon - baryon interaction .",
    "the numerical results of the loop model @xcite are summarized in table i. a glance at these numbers shows that the magnitude of the @xmath0 contributions exceeds those of the @xmath20 contributions by factors of @xmath54 .",
    "as already mentioned , the main reason for these unrealistically large contributions can been traced to the unusually large @xmath9 cutoff parameter @xmath55 gev found in @xcite .",
    "it has twice the size of the typical hadronic scale @xmath56 gev around which such cutoff parameters lie normally .",
    "a substantially larger value ( which in our case also exceeds the largest hadron masses in the loops by a factor of two ) must be considered suspect in any model with hadronic degrees of freedom since one expects their quark ",
    "gluon substructure to become relevant at such scales .",
    "indeed , the appearance of anomalously large cutoffs in a potential model suggests that those cutoffs are burdened with  short  distance physics ( not directly related to the @xmath0 sector )  which would otherwise remain unaccounted for . literally taking such effects over to the loop ",
    "model estimates of the nucleon s strangeness content , by fully associating them with the physical @xmath57 would therefore very likely be misleading .",
    "a hint that the @xmath0 sector of the original bonn ",
    "jlich potential might indeed be overburdened can be obtained from a comparison with the conceptually similar nijmegen @xmath10 potential @xcite .",
    "the nijmegen potential contains more degrees of freedom in the scalar meson sector ( including a pomeron ) and finds a much smaller @xmath0 cutoff @xmath58 gev .",
    "morevoer , a smaller @xmath0 cutoff is also favored in the forthcoming update of the bonn ",
    "jlich potential @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 cutoff of this model is expected to lie around @xmath59 gev @xcite .",
    "hence , nowadays smaller cutoffs seem to be consistently favored by @xmath10 potential models .",
    "this motivated our reanalysis of the loop ",
    "model results of ref .",
    "@xcite for the nucleon s strangeness observables ( as also suggested in @xcite ) which we will discuss below . to get a qualitative idea of the range of coupling and cutoff values to be considered , and to maintain the underlying philosophy of the loop model",
    ", we will orient ourselves at the values used in the existing potential models .",
    "of course , these values depend to some extent on the particular dynamics and particle content of a given model , and since the various potential models and also our model differ in this respect , the corresponding parameter sets can not be directly compared or strictly related to each other . however , we expect the parameter ranges considered below , in particular for the cutoffs , to cover most of the physically reasonable parameter space of our model .    we begin our discussion of the parameter dependence by documenting the sensitivity of the results to variations in the cutoff . to this end , we display the cutoff dependence in the range @xmath60 , which covers all so far proposed values for @xmath37 .",
    "the first two figures show the behavior of the dirac strangeness radius ( fig .",
    "1a ) and the strangeness magnetic moment ( fig .",
    "1b ) as a function of @xmath61 , with the @xmath0 couplings fixed at the old , @xmath48based bonn  jlich values given above . the full curves show the total results , the dashed ones represent the @xmath62 contributions , the dash  dotted ones the @xmath63 contributions , and the dotted curve corresponds to the result from the @xmath20 loop .",
    "clearly , the cutoff dependence is very pronounced , reducing e.g. the value of ref .",
    "@xcite for the magnetic moment by almost an order of magnitude for @xmath64 gev .",
    "the reduction is even considerably stronger for the nijmegen value @xmath65 gev .",
    "although a strong cutoff dependence was to be expected ( especially due to the enhanced degree of divergence of @xmath66the @xmath0 loops with derivative couplings ) , its actual magnitude is still surprising .",
    "if cutoff sizes of the order of that used in the nijmegen potential were to be the most realistic , some of the conclusions reached in @xcite would have to be revised .",
    "in particular , for cutoffs of the nijmegen size some sort of `` convergence '' of the intermediate  state sum ( to one loop )  could not anymore be excluded . in this case",
    "the kaon cloud contribution might well be sufficient for a first orientation about the overall size of the nucleon s strangeness content in hadronic one  loop models , as advocated in @xcite and in contrast to the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite in the quark model .",
    "other problematic aspects of hadron  loop models , such as the expected importance of rescattering corrections and unitarity violations @xcite , are of course not affected by these arguments .",
    "the strong cutoff dependence of the strangeness observables exposes another , both conceptual and practical problem of hadronic loop models .",
    "although the cutoff is principally a physical parameter ( which indicates up to which resolution a purely hadronic description might be adequate ) , the foundations of the approach are not solid enough to give it a precise and quantitative meaning . moreover",
    ", the available @xmath10 scattering data do not allow an accurate determination of the @xmath8 form factors even in the framework of a specific potential model , not to mention other sources of uncertainty as , for example , the largely uncontrolled off  shell ambiguities incurred by transplanting such form factors into another model context . as a consequence , the numerical value of the @xmath0 cutoff can not be accurately determined , and the corresponding uncertainty propagates , amplified by a hightened sensitivity , into the strangeness observables .",
    "these facts already imply that at most semi  quantitative predictions can be expected from the hadron  loop approach .",
    "the existing @xmath10 potential models differ not only in the momentum dependence of the @xmath8 form factors , but also in the values of the corresponding @xmath0 couplings .",
    "the @xmath0 vector ( dirac ) coupling of the nijmegen potential is , for example , considerably smaller than the one of ref .",
    "@xcite which we used above . in order to illustrate the dependence of the strange form  factor moments on these couplings , we compare in fig .",
    "2 the @xmath0 contributions to the strangeness radius ( fig . 2a ) and magnetic moment ( fig .",
    "2b )  for the five pairs ( @xmath67 ) , ( @xmath68 ) , ( @xmath69 ) , ( @xmath70 ) , ( @xmath71 ) of coupling values ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "the first of these pairs corresponds to the values of holzenkamp et al . while the others were chosen to encompass the range of values which appear in other potential models .",
    "2 a , b demonstrate that the variations of the strangeness observables due to different choices for the couplings can be quite substantial for large values of the @xmath0 cutoff .",
    "the sensitivity to the couplings remains fairly small , however , for @xmath61 of the order of @xmath73 gev , in particular for the strange magnetic moment and for couplings in the range between the bonn - jlich ( @xmath67 ) and nijmegen @xcite ( @xmath74 ) values .    throughout all of the above calculations we have kept the values of ref .",
    "@xcite for the cutoff and coupling of the kaon fixed .",
    "the nijmegen potential uses a pseudovector coupling which can not be related without off  shell ambiguities to the pseudoscalar coupling of the bonn ",
    "jlich potential . on ",
    "shell , the equivalent pseudoscalar coupling of the nijmegen potential ( @xmath75 ) differs by less than 5% from the bonn ",
    "jlich coupling used here , and the nijmegen cutoff parameter @xmath76 gev @xcite is similarly close to the one we use . in any case , the cutoff and coupling values from potential models should not be taken too literally since , as discussed above , the limited available data and the implicit model assumptions do not allow their precise ( and unique ) determination .",
    "we close this section with a remark on alternative choices for the internal form factors .",
    "the bonn monopole form factors ( [ ff ] ) have two well - known limitations : an artificial zero for cutoffs of the size of the meson mass ( due to on - shell normalization ) on which we will comment in the next section , and an unphysical singularity at time - like momenta @xmath77 .",
    "although the singularity can be tamed by the usual causal boundary condition , it will still affect the values of the loop amplitudes to a certain extent .",
    "this problem could be avoided , although at the price of additional model dependence , by choosing alternative , singularity - free extrapolations of the bonn form factors into the time - like region .",
    "one such extrapolation was proposed in ref .",
    "all of the currently running or planned experiments measure the strange vector form factors at @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , their data need to be extrapolated in order to obtain the leading form - factor moments .",
    "this extrapolation requires information on the momentum dependence of the form factors ( at low energies ) and thus on the spatial strangeness distribution inside the nucleon . in the following section we will evaluate the loop - model predictions for the momentum dependence by extending the above calculations to momentum transfers @xmath79 1 gev@xmath80 both strange vector form factors will be measured in about the same @xmath81-range by the planned spectrometer experiment g0 at jefferson lab @xcite .     in the loop model , the coupling of the strange current to hyperon",
    ", meson , @xmath82 vertex or @xmath83 transition vertex inside the loop is described by corresponding vertex functions , which we list in the appendix .",
    "these vertex functions contain the full momentum dependence of the form factors and can be evaluated numerically .",
    "fixing the cutoffs for the @xmath0 and the kaon at @xmath84 gev and using the nijmegen values for the coupling , we show in fig .",
    "3 ( solid line ) the resulting strange magnetic form factor @xmath85 together with the data point measured by the sample experiment at @xmath86 gev@xmath87 @xcite .",
    "( for comparison we have also included the older data point from the first runs only . )",
    "figure 4 ( solid line ) shows the loop - model prediction for the combination @xmath88 measured by the happex  collaboration , together with their data point at @xmath89 gev@xmath87 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding loop - model results for the dirac strangeness radius and magnetic moment are given in table i.    at first sight , the results are in disagreement with both the sample  and the happex data .",
    "the measured form factor combinations are both positive ( at their respective momentum transfers ) while the loop model leads to negative form factors of smaller slopes and magnitudes . in particular , the loop model predicts - like the majority of the other so far investigated models - a small and negative value for the strangeness magnetic moment .    with regard to the sample result , however , there is a caveat .",
    "the derivation of the strangeness form factor from the measured asymmetry requires knowledge of the neutral weak axial form factor @xmath90 of the nucleon and , in particular , its isovector radiative correction @xcite .",
    "the newest published value @xmath91 gev@xmath92 is based on the theoretical estimate @xcite for this radiative correction , which carries a substantial amount of uncertainty .",
    "the sample collaboration is currently measuring with a deuterium target @xcite in order to pin down the axial weak form factor contribution separately . only after taking these data or more accurate and reliable theoretical estimates into account ( which could substantially change the quoted value for @xmath91 gev@xmath93 both in sign an magnitude ) can the strange magnetic moment be extracted unambigously and compared to the small value of the loop - model prediction .    furthermore , it is interesting to note that the results of the loop model could be made consistent with the happex data by allowing for smaller cutoff values , as suggested by recent applications of the meson cloud model to deeply inelastic scattering @xcite . in order to illustrate this point",
    ", we show in figs . 3 and 4 ( dashed lines ) the results obtained by using @xmath94 gev , which also brings the magnetic form factor somewhat closer to the sample data point . moreover ,",
    "this cutoff value is very close to the @xmath0 mass and therefore effectively switches off the internal @xmath0 form factors ( cf .",
    "( [ ff ] ) ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the contributions from the @xmath0 and the @xmath83 transition are completely negligible relative to the kaon contribution .",
    "this shows that the @xmath0 contributions worsen the agreement of the loop model predictions with the current experimental results .",
    "however , the zeros of the bonn form factors have to be regarded as artefacts of the on - shell normalization and the results for the small cutoffs should therefore be viewed with caution .",
    "the latter reservations are enhanced by the difficulties with the physical interpretation of cutoffs of the same size as particle masses in a loop .    in figs . 5 and 6 we show the @xmath20 , @xmath0 and @xmath83 transition contributions to the dirac ( @xmath95 ) and pauli ( @xmath96 ) form factors separately ( again for @xmath84 gev and nijmegen couplings ) .",
    "these figures demonstrate that even with the new values for cutoffs and couplings adopted in the present paper , the @xmath0 and @xmath83 contributions are still of the same order of magnitude as the kaon contributions .",
    "this is in contrast to the much smaller size of these contributions to the strangeness magnetic moment in the chiral quark model @xcite . in the latter",
    "the tensor coupling of the @xmath0 to the quarks is small , while the contributions from the vector coupling partially cancel each other and become proportional to the difference between the light and strange quark constituent masses , and therefore also small .",
    "finally , we present the loop - model result for the form - factor combination @xmath97 which the forthcoming mami a4 experiment @xcite plans to measure at @xmath98 gev@xmath87 . we find @xmath99 where the same reservations as above apply to the smaller cutoff value .",
    "to summarize , we have analyzed the cutoff , coupling , and momentum dependence of the @xmath0 contributions to the nucleon s vector strangeness content in the hadronic one  loop model of ref .",
    "it turns out that the softer @xmath8 form factors now generally favored by @xmath10 potential models have some welcome consequences for such models .",
    "first , they can reduce the @xmath0 contributions to the strangeness radius and magnetic moment by over an order of magnitude , thereby indicating that the contributions from the lightest @xmath100 intermediate states might be sufficient for rough estimates of the strangeness content in one  loop models .",
    "although the @xmath0 contributions remain non  negligible ( in particular towards larger momentum transfers ) and worsen the agreement with the data of the happex experiment , they cease to be unrealistically large and they do not anymore exclude some sort of ( slow ) `` convergence '' of the intermediate state sum .",
    "the very sensitive dependence of the results on the @xmath0 cutoff emphasizes , however , the limited and mostly  qualitative character of hadron  loop model predicitions .",

    "<S> a crucial input for recent meson hyperon cloud model estimates of the nucleon matrix element of the strangeness current are the nucleon  hyperon@xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) form factors which regularize some of the arising loops . prompted by new and forthcoming information on these form factors from hyperon  nucleon potential models </S>",
    "<S> , we analyze the dependence of the loop model results for the strange  quark observables on the @xmath1 form factors and couplings . </S>",
    "<S> we find , in particular , that the now generally favored soft @xmath2 form factors can reduce the magnitude of the @xmath0 contributions in such models by more than an order of magnitude , compared to previous results with hard form factors . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss some general implications of our results for hadronic loop models .    /#1/#1 </S>",
