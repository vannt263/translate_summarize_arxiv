    "@xcite studied the influence of gravity on magnetic monopoles , but their results do neither guarantee the existence nor the stability of the solutions as shown in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",

    "@xcite , ortiz @xcite ) investigated ",
    "t  hooft s and polyakov s monopoles ( @xcite , @xcite ) in curved space using numerical methods . introducing the dimensionless parameters @xmath0 ( with the planck mass @xmath1 ) and @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the mass of the corresponding yang - mills field and higgs field respectively , breitenlohner et al .",
    "@xcite presented the following results : for @xmath5 the monopole mass varies only over a finite domain .",
    "choosing the parameter @xmath6 solutions seem to exist for @xmath7 . for @xmath8",
    "there are two solutions with different masses .",
    "considering the mass as a function of @xmath9 , one finds that it attains a maximum @xmath10 for @xmath11 , and that it decreases towards @xmath12 asymptotically as @xmath9 tends to @xmath13 .",
    "this situation is shown in * figure  1*. each point represents a solution calculated numerically .",
    "the right plot of * figure  1 * is a magnification of the left plot near the point @xmath14 .",
    "the series of points marked by @xmath15 will be denoted by `` upper branch '' , the part @xmath16 by `` lower branch '' .",
    "= 6.3 cm    = 6.3 cm    in this paper stability of the nonabelian gravitating magnetic monopoles is investigated using the technique of spherically symmetric perturbations .",
    "stability considerations of similar nature have been conducted by zhou and straumann @xcite .",
    "the stability problem requires the numerical behaviour of the monopole solutions to be known .",
    "the construction of the monopole solutions in question ( @xcite ) is briefly reviewed . in order to investigate their stability the monopoles",
    "are subjected to small perturbations in time , which have a fourier expansion due to its linearity . eliminating the gravitational degrees of freedom , the remaining terms in the action",
    "are written as a quadratic form .",
    "then the application of jacobi s criterion ( @xcite , @xcite ) suggests instability on the branch @xmath15 and stability under spherically symmetric perturbations on the lower branch .",
    "note however that this does not imply stability in general . in the final section",
    "the results are summarized and discussed .",
    "the t hooft polyakov monopole in curved space is a static finite energy solution of an so(3 ) gauge theory with a triplet of scalar fields . using a",
    "coordinate free notation the action reads @xmath17    where @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote the curvature scalar , the yang - mills field and the scalar field respectively . @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the gravitational constant and the gauge coupling .",
    "@xmath23 is the hodge star operator and @xmath24 is a potential term which will be specified later .",
    "the gravitational field is described by a static spherically symmetric metric tensor given by the line element @xmath25 in schwarzschild coordinates : @xmath26 the minimal ansatz for the yang - mills potential @xmath27 which is spherically symmetric is denoted in polar coordinates and abelian gauge as follows ( @xcite,@xcite , @xcite ) : @xmath28 the @xmath29 , @xmath30 , are the generators of the fundamental representation of so(3 ) . using the potential @xmath27 the field @xmath31 is expressed by @xmath32.\\ ] ] the higgs field is chosen to be @xmath33    in order to reduce the four dimensional action to a one dimensional integral the curvature scalar , the yang - mills , and the higgs terms are substituted into the action ( [ wifu ] ) : @xmath34    with @xmath35    the term @xmath36 represents the potential @xmath37 .",
    "the equations of motion ( eymh equations ) deduced from the action ( [ rerewifu ] ) contain the parameters and as well .",
    "their values determine the stability properties of the monopoles .",
    "the `` background solution '' @xmath38 corresponding to global regular monopoles has been obtained solving the equations of motion with a multiple shooting method @xcite .",
    "the static background solution @xmath39 is subjected to a spherically symmetric perturbation @xmath40 , i.e. the perturbed and the background solutions are related as follows : @xmath41    where @xmath39 is the vector of the functions @xmath42 and @xmath43 and @xmath44 denotes the vector @xmath45 of the radial parts of the perturbations .",
    "it is convenient to introduce @xmath43 and @xmath46 : @xmath47    instability in this context means the growth of the exponential term in time .",
    "the analysis is thus reduced to the question whether admissible perturbations , i.e. perturbations fulfilling the boundary conditions , with an imaginary frequency exist . substituting @xmath48 into the action ( [ wifu ] ) one obtains a two dimensional reduced action differing from ( [ rerewifu ] ) only by the time - dependent additional term @xmath49    the part of the reduced action quadratic in the fields and their derivatives turns out to be @xmath50    taking into account the boundary conditions at @xmath51 , the variation with respect to @xmath52 yields @xmath53    where @xmath54 is the integrand of and @xmath55 , and @xmath56 denote the derivatives with respect to @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "( [ dgls ] ) is solved by @xmath59    this result is used to eliminate @xmath60 and @xmath52 in @xmath61 .",
    "partial integration and introduction of @xmath62 and the variable @xmath63 by @xmath64 leads to the normal form of a 2-channel schrdinger problem @xmath61 : @xmath65    here @xmath66    the background solution is unstable , iff the schrdinger problem admits a bound state , that is a solution with @xmath67 .",
    "the standard technique for a 2-channel schrdinger problem is to calculate the equations of motion from ( [ 2-k ] ) , which then define an eigenvalue problem with the eigenvalue @xmath68 . instead of analyzing the spectrum of this operator the positive definiteness of ( [ 2-k ] ) without the last term",
    "is investigated applying jacobi s criterion @xcite , @xcite .",
    "although in @xcite it is formulated for compact intervals only the proof applies in this case to an infinite interval of integration , too , in view of the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath69 .",
    "the discussion of jacobi s criterion in @xcite also provides a normalizable perturbation with negative energy .",
    "this criterion states that the monopole solutions are unstable iff @xmath70",
    "@xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 denote the solutions of two linearly independent initial value problems for the equations of motion in the fields @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( jacobi equation ) .",
    "the initial values are chosen such that they are compatible with the symmetries of the background solution .",
    "a high order runge - kutta - fehlberg method @xcite has been employed for the numerical integration of this system of differential equations .",
    "first we discuss the results in the prasad - sommerfield limit .",
    "the numerical analysis shows that the branch @xmath15 in * figure  1 * is unstable in the sense of linear perturbation theory , since the determinant has a zero in the interior of the integration interval .    in *",
    "figure  2 * the determinant ( [ det ] ) is shown for some values of the parameter on the upper branch branch . for @xmath77 ,",
    "that is the value of @xmath78 where the function @xmath79 has a minimum ( see @xcite ) , @xmath80 attains a local maximum .",
    "a second maximum at greater values of @xmath81 is observed for some values of @xmath82 . for near @xmath83 the second",
    "maximum dominates , whereas , if is approximately @xmath13 the left peak is well developed . for decreasing values of ( @xmath84 )",
    "the zero of the determinant moves to the left .",
    "it is convenient to rescale the determinant by @xmath85 in order to present the functions for all -values of the upper branch in one plot ( see * figure  3 * ) .",
    "the pronounced minimum in the left part of * figure  3 * is due to the rescaling of @xmath86 .",
    "it suggests that @xmath87 , i.e. in the neighbourhood of this point the determinant increases more slowly than @xmath88 .",
    "for @xmath83 the determinant has a zero at infinity in agreement with a theorem in @xcite which states that a change of the stability properties can only happen at a point of bifurcation in the masses . from this theorem",
    "it follows that the whole lower branch in * figure  1 * consists of stable solutions , because of the stability of the prasad - sommerfield solution in flat space ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "= 6.3 cm    = 6.3 cm    = 6.3 cm    the bifurcation point is determined using jacobi s criterion",
    ". for increasing values of the method becomes more and more sensitive which means that the error becomes smaller and smaller .",
    "the determinant corresponding to solutions on the lower branch is plotted in * figure  4*. as expected these functions have no zeros .",
    "the curve with the steepest ascent belongs to @xmath90 .",
    "* figure  5 * and * 6 * show the results for some selected values of @xmath91 .",

    "* figure  6 * uses the same @xmath94-values , but @xmath9-values on the upper branch .",
