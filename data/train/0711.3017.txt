    "the dynamic plasticity of beryllium on nanosecond time scales is important in the development of inertial confinement fusion ( icf ) @xcite .",
    "the initial experiments on thermonuclear ignition at the national ignition facility will use 192 laser beams to deliver 1 - 2mj of energy inside a hohlraum .",
    "the resulting flux of soft x - rays will implode a spherical capsule containing cryogenic deuterium - tritium ( dt ) fuel .",
    "if the implosion is sufficiently vigorous and uniform then thermonuclear burn is predicted to propagate from the central hotspot .",
    "the implosion has a relatively high aspect ratio ( initial to final radius ) of around 30 , and is unstable with respect to spatial variations in thickness , surface finish , or radiation drive .",
    "a leading material for the fuel capsule is be containing up to around 1  weight percent of cu to increase its opacity to the radiation drive .",
    "compared to alternative capsule materials such as plastic , be is dense and has a high thermal conductivity , which helps maintain a uniform layer of dt ice . however , be exhibits elastic and plastic anisotropy when subjected respect to mechanical or thermal loading .",
    "this anisotropic response is likely to induce velocity fluctuations from the hohlraum drive , which may seed significant implosion instabilities .",
    "it is thus necessary to define a specification for the microstructure ",
    "e.g. a maximum grain size  for be - cu in an icf capsule .",
    "the response of be on relevant length and time scales , @xmath0100@xmath1 m and @xmath010ns , has not been characterized previously , so this work includes the development and calibration of appropriate models , continuum mechanics simulations in which the microstructure is resolved in order to predict the velocity fluctuations directly , and the experimental validation of predictions of anisotropic response and instability seeding .",
    "the continuum mechanics simulations are computationally expensive in three dimensions , so some systematic studies of the velocity fluctuations are performed in fewer dimensions .",
    "a mixture model , originally developed for reactive flow studies @xcite but subsequently used for other applications including the shock compression of porous minerals @xcite , was generalized to predict the average response of strong , polycrystalline materials , as an inline treatment of texture at coarser resolutions .",
    "this paper discusses experiments performed to investigate the elastic - plastic response of be on nanosecond time scales , and the development of physically - based models to describe the behavior .",
    "the mixture model , with extensions for strength , is presented .",
    "the treatment of strength should allow material damage and failure to be modeled seamlessly ; damage pertinent to dynamic failure by spallation is discussed .",
    "plastic flow in be under dynamic loading was investigated experimentally using laser ablation to induce shock waves .",
    "experiments were performed at the trident laser facility at los alamos , which has been used to induce shocks and quasi - isentropic compression waves by ablation of a free surface @xcite , and also to induce loading and accelerate flyer plates by ablation through a transparent substrate to act as confinement @xcite .",
    "trident has a nd : glass laser system with a fundamental wavelength of 1054 nm . for more efficient coupling with matter , the pulse was frequency - doubled to 527 nm ( green ) . operating in nanosecond mode ,",
    "the pulse comprised up to 13 elements 180ps long for each of which the intensity could be set independently , allowing the irradiance history to be controlled , with a total energy of up to 250j . in each experiment ,",

    "the analysis and interpretation of shock wave experiments , it is desirable that the loading history should be constant for some period , then fall rapidly to zero . a disadvantage in using ablative loading compared with flyer impact experiments is that the relation between irradiance history and pressure history applied to the sample is not simple : for instance , a constant irradiance does not lead to a constant drive pressure @xcite .",
    "the irradiance history must in general be tailored to the material , desired pressure , and pulse duration . often on nanosecond time scales ,",
    "a constant pressure requires an irradiance history which increases by several tens of percent over the duration of the pulse .",
    "tailored pulse shapes such as this can be generated at trident because of the flexibility in pulse construction , but would generally require several iterations because of inaccuracies in radiation hydrodynamic simulations used to predict the desired shape , making it necessary to perform experiments on shock flatness to verify and adjust the shape .",
    "the pulse shape and energy produced by the laser were not perfectly reproducible , so there is a limit to the accuracy with which the pressure history can be specified ",
    "e.g. , constant  on a given shot . rather than attempting to use an ideal irradiance history ,",
    "the pulse shape was measured on each shot and used in radiation hydrodynamics simulations to predict the pressure history at a point close to the ablated surface .",
    "the pressure history was then used as a time - dependent boundary condition in continuum mechanics simulations , allowing more detailed models of the behavior of condensed matter to be used without requiring the simulation program to include radiation physics also .",
    "this procedure has been found to work well for a range of applications on metallic and non - metallic elements , and intermetallic compounds @xcite , largely because relevant material properties in the plasma state  the equation of state ( eos ) , opacity , and conductivities  can be predicted with adequate accuracy .",
    "for the pressures of a few tens of gigapascals considered here , the radiation hydrodynamics simulations predicted that less than a micrometer of material was ablated .",
    "recovered samples have shown only a thin ( @xmath01@xmath1 m ) layer of the remaining material significantly affected by the heat associated with the ablation process .",
    "at a few tens of micrometers , the sample thickness was two orders of magnitude less than the spot size , so the experiments were one - dimensional during the passage of the initial shock and subsequent release from the drive surface and the surface monitored by velocimetry .",
    "one - dimensional simulations of radiation hydrodynamics and continuum mechanics were adequate .",
    "the radiation hydrodynamics simulations used the computer programs ` lasnex ' @xcite and ` hyades ' @xcite .",
    "the continuum mechanics simulations used the program ` lagc1d ' @xcite .",
    "these programs used second - order finite difference representations of space and time with lagrangian ( material - following ) derivatives , and artificial viscosity to stabilize shocks .",
    "the plasticity experiments on be included single crystals and rolled foils .",
    "the crystals were cut nominally parallel to @xmath3 planes from a boule grown by zone refining , and were polished to 30 - 40@xmath1 m thick .",
    "the rocking curves were around @xmath4 wide , full width , half maximum ( fig .",

    "the rocking curve was determined statically by diffraction of cu @xmath5 x - rays , integrated over almost the whole of each sample .",
    "the profile of the dynamic diffraction lines was consistent with the static rocking curve , though there was some sign that in the dynamic diffraction geometry , where the source was quite close to the sample , the width of the diffracted lines was slightly narrower .",
    "the foils were commercial high - purity material ( at least 99.8%  be ) .",
    "the texture , measured by x - ray orientation mapping , was found to be with @xmath6-axes oriented predominantly normal to the foil ",

    "[ fig : foilorient ] ) . compared with the single crystals ,",
    "the foils presumably had been subjected to a much greater degree of plastic work .    in the velocity history records from the single crystal experiments , the elastic precursor was very clear with the lowest pressure drive ( mean pressure @xmath9gpa ) .",
    "the velocity showed a sharp initial peak ( rise time faster than could be resolved ) , followed by a deceleration , followed by the main plastic wave ( fig .",
    "[ fig : uhist ] ) . the x - ray diffraction records for the three lowest pressures exhibited a peak corresponding to the uniaxial compression in the precursor deduced from the initial peak , and at the lowest two pressures an additional peak corresponding to the same volumetric compression but expressed isotropically rather than uniaxially  suggesting that plastic relaxation to an isotropic state occurred before the plastic wave arrived ( figs  [ fig : txdunfold ] and [ fig : txdlatt ] ) .",
    "velocity histories from experiments on rolled foils of similar thickness showed a precursor of lower amplitude , with a finite and reproducible rise time of around 400ps ( fig .",
    "[ fig : uhist ] ) .",
    "the amplitude of the precursor varied more between experiments , with higher amplitudes observed in thinner foils .",
    "the higher amplitudes could be caused by time - dependence of plastic flow , or by greater plastic strain imparted by rolling to a thinner foil .",
    "the laser doppler diagnostic recorded the velocity history over a line across each sample .",
    "the records obtained from single crystals were spatially uniform , demonstrating that the laser drive was adequately smooth over the surface of the sample . some of the foil records exhibited spatial variations in velocity following the precursor , in particular regions in which there was a deceleration after the initial elastic peak , resembling the single crystal velocity history ( fig .",
    "[ fig : uxhist ] ) .    these velocity data  particularly the single crystal record ",
    "were compared against simulations using different models of dynamic plasticity .",
    "there was some uncertainty in sample thickness , and there was also some timing jitter in the signal used to trigger the diagnostic cameras , so timing variations of up to @xmath10ns were plausible .",
    "several models have been developed to describe the plastic response of be under dynamic loading @xcite , based on gas gun experiments using samples of the order of millimeters thick .",
    "the laser - driven samples were a few tens of micrometers thick , so any time - dependence in the plastic flow processes would be expected to lead to a higher flow stress and thus a higher velocity in the elastic precursor ; this is in fact what was observed .",
    "one of the published models ( steinberg - lund ) is time - dependent , but these experiments explored time scales far shorter than the regime in which the model was calibrated , so one would not expect it necessarily to perform well .",
    "the speed of the free surface from the elastic precursor was a significant fraction of the speed induced by the plastic shock .",
    "the elastic wave reaches the surface first , reflects from it , and rattles between the surface and the shock . for a given shock pressure ,",
    "the maximum speed seen at the free surface depends on the amplitude of the elastic wave . for a perfect model of the drive pressure",
    ", one would not expect the peak free surface velocity to match the experiment unless the elastic wave was modeled adequately .",
    "spall was ignored in most of the simulations , so the calculated surface velocity decelerated close to zero after the end of the drive pulse .      for reference ,",
    "simulations were performed with no strength model , i.e. the scalar eos only .",
    "a cubic grneisen form was used @xcite ; it was found previously that all common eos agree for the mechanical response of be in the regime explored by these experiments . with no elastic wave ,",
    "the peak surface velocity was higher than observed ; the arrival time of the shock was consistent with the experiment .",

    "the amplitude of the precursor was much lower than observed experimentally .",
    "the initial peak could be reproduced with @xmath18gpa and the following trough with @xmath19gpa ; the shape was not reproduced using this model . with high values of the flow stress , the effect of the reverberating elastic wave was evident as a sequence of steps in the acceleration history .",
    "the steps were similar to some features seen in the experimental velocity history .",

    "the steinberg - guinan model @xcite is a generalization of the elastic - plastic model to include work - hardening and thermal softening . and varying the initial plastic strain @xmath20 to investigate the sensitivity .",
    "no set of parameters was found which was capable of reproducing the detailed structure of the precursor .",
    "if the maximum flow stress was increased to give an approximate match to the amplitude of the precursor , the amplitude and duration of the plastic peak became very different to the observed velocity record .",
    "the steinberg - lund model @xcite is a generalization of the steinberg - guinan model to include time - dependence . using the published parameters for be ,",
    "the amplitude of the elastic wave was lower than observed and the plastic shock released much earlier then observed .",
    "no set of parameters was found which reproduced the observed velocity history .      rather than attempting to test and calibrate explicit microstructural plasticity models directly against the experimental data , simple extensions of the elastic - perfectly plastic model were made to include time dependence with as few other parameters as possible .",

    "the simulations exhibited many small - amplitude spikes , caused by under - damped reverberations of the precursor .",
    "work - hardening from plastic flow behind the initial wave would cause a smearing of the plastic wave and should act to damp out the reverberations , but this was not investigated in the context of this model .    a slightly more realistic flow model was investigated to add the flexibility to reproduce the characteristic decay time of the precursor independently of its initial amplitude . in reality , the barrier for defect hopping mechanisms in a crystal is altered by the strain .",

    "a good fit to the initial peak and the subsequent deceleration was obtained for @xmath34/ns , though the acceleration during the plastic wave was sharper .",
    "as with the plastic relaxation model , overall rise time of the plastic wave matched the experiment because of the delay introduced by the step during the rise .",

    "this is the case for sputtered be - cu alloy in icf , where the texture may change radially through the capsule , particularly in the presence of an ion current . a predictive , inline mixture model is desirable here for simulations at varying degrees of detail from resolved microstructure to continuum - averaged properties .",

    "the formation and propagation of cracks and voids is dominated by stress concentrations , i.e. localization phenomena caused by the heterogeneity of the microstructure .",
    "stress concentration is not treated adequately by the overlap tensor , so sub - scale physics is required , at least at the level of an effective flow stress for the solid microstructure under tension .",
    "this is similar to the situation with heating induced by pore collapse in the previous work on heterogeneous high explosives @xcite , where additional shape functions were used to model the enhanced heating around a collapsing pore , i.e. representing the width of the temperature distribution as well as the mean .",
    "the heterogeneous model should not be expected to predict the explicit formation and evolution of pre - existing or incipient damage sites .",

    "the flow stress was much higher than has been observed on microsecond scales , and exhibited relatively complicated temporal structure .",

    "a heterogeneous mixture model developed previously for reactive flow studies was extended to treat strength with a representation of material texture , and seems to be a promising platform to treat spall .",
    "accurate models of plasticity and phase changes in the homogeneous components of the mixture are needed to support physics - based damage and spall models .",
    "such physics - based models are necessary to relate the large pool of experimental data and theoretical work from microsecond time scales and slower to the qualitatively and quantitatively different behavior observed in high energy density experiments .",
