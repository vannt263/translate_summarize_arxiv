    "<S> [ fgr : dv]b and then a dislocation dipole ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fgr : dv]c ) , before forming a defect composed of clustered di - vacancies ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fgr : dv]d ) . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fgr : dv]a  d also present two frequently observed linear arrangements of di - vacancies .    because atom ejection occurs at random positions , vacancies initially appear randomly in the area exposed to the electron beam . </S>",
    "<S> however , during lower - energy exposure ( _ e.g. _ , 80  kev ) , these defects travel via a re - bonding mechanism , which is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fgr : dv]e . </S>",
    "<S> each migration step is initiated by a single electron impact from which the atom obtains energy slightly below @xmath6 . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> electron irradiation provides the activation energy to drive the system from a local energy minimum into another one , in our case predominantly via ( reversible ) bond rotations ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> [ fgr : dv]c ) and @xmath11(555 - 777 ) ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fgr : dv]a ) ] have formation energies @xmath12 which differ from that of the @xmath11(5 - 8 - 5 ) by @xmath13  ev and @xmath14  ev , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> [ fgr : dv]a  c ) , the energy gain is 2.01  ev . in this case , </S>",
    "<S> a tetragon is formed where the two pentagons of the adjacent di - vacancies would overlap . </S>",
    "<S> hrtem simulation of the dft - optimized structure of the defect is in excellent agreement with the experimental image  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath0-bonded carbon tetragons in molecules , as in cyclobutadiene , can be stabilized only at low temperatures and when the molecules are embedded into a matrix  @xcite . in our case </S>",
    "<S> they are stabilized by the surrounding graphene lattice , as theoretically predicted for nanotubes  @xcite .        under 100  kev irradiation , </S>",
    "<S> atom ejection occurs at a very slow rate , so that changes in the atomic network are sufficiently slow to be precisely resolved . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the reconstruction of vacancy defects via bond rotations can be monitored immediately after a vacancy is generated . </S>",
    "<S> an example is presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fgr : mvac ] . the initial configuration ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fgr : mvac]a ) consists of three di - vacancies in the armchair orientation ( formed prior to recording the first image ) . in the recorded images , the structure loses atoms until 24 atoms are missing . </S>",
    "<S> several remarkable configurational changes are found in this image sequence . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fgr : mvac]a  c shows a collapse of linearly clustered defects into an apparently less defective structure with a dislocation dipole . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to the prediction of jeong _ et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that the dislocation dipole is favored over a large multi - vacancy . </S>",
    "<S> however , this requires a linear arrangement of vacancies . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fgr : mvac]c  d shows the loss of four additional atoms . </S>",
    "<S> two of them gave rise to an additional di - vacancy ; the other two contributed to the separation of the dislocation cores ( the rotated hexagon , clustered with a stone - wales defect , constitutes a dislocation core ) . during continued irradiation </S>",
    "<S> , we see the formation of a cluster of rotated hexagons surrounded by a chain of alternating pentagons and heptagons ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fgr : mvac]e  h ) . </S>",
    "<S> such configurations , rotated by @xmath16 with respect to the original lattice and matched by pentagons and heptagons to the zigzag lattice direction , appear to be the preferred way to incorporate missing atoms in the graphene structure . </S>",
    "<S> due to the matching numbers of pentagons and heptagons  and hence cancellation of negative and positive curvature  </S>",
    "<S> these structures remain flat .        </S>",
    "<S> to understand the driving force for the transformations , we calculated @xmath12 for the simplest defect structures matching the obverved trend of forming a rotated hexagon kernel . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest - energy tetra - vacancy ( four missing atoms ) can be created by combining two @xmath11(5555 - 6 - 7777 ) di - vacancies , whereas the hexa - vacancy ( six missing atom ) requires three of these defects ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fgr : dft]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , these configurations have the lowest @xmath12 of any reported vacancy structures with equal number of missing atoms in graphene ( @xmath12 per missing atom multiplied by the number of missing atoms are @xmath173.14  ev and @xmath182.50  ev ) . </S>",
    "<S> a hole with six missing atoms has a formation energy of @xmath193.15  ev , while for a dislocation and a hckelite - like structure values of @xmath193.72  ev and @xmath182.64  ev have been reported  @xcite , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> evidently , the rotated hexagon defects spawn the family of lowest energy multi - vacancies in graphene . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to what was recently shown for the zigzag - oriented di - vacancies  @xcite , these structures open a band gap in graphene , as can be seen from the density of states ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fgr : dft]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated band gap is in the order of 200  mev . </S>",
    "<S> this value is possibly underestimated within the used gga approximation , and advanced dft methods are likely to give a higher value  @xcite .        to conclude , we have shown how an electron beam can be used to selectively suppress and enhance bond rotations and atom removal in graphene . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrated that irradiation at electron energies just above the threshold for atom displacement turns graphene not into a `` perforated graphene '' but a two - dimensional coherent amorphous membrane composed of @xmath1hybridized carbon atoms . </S>",
    "<S> this membrane grows through nucleation and expansion of defects which result from electron beam  driven di - vacancy migration and agglomeration . </S>",
    "<S> these defect configurations predominantly consist of a 30@xmath20 rotated kernel of hexagons surrounded by a chain of alternating pentagons and heptagons . </S>",
    "<S> these defects are the energetically favored way for the graphene lattice to accommodate missing atoms , and have a semi - conducting nature . </S>",
    "<S> since several of the presented examples of the two - dimensional @xmath0hybridized defect configurations violate the ipr , due to increased reactivity  @xcite , they may be exploited for functionalization of graphene . </S>",
    "<S> we also showed unambiguous evidence for four - membered carbon rings in graphitic structures . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , despite of the large amount of research , the richness of carbon chemistry continues to provide surprises . </S>",
    "<S> more examples of the observed structures and videos of the complete tem image series are presented in ref .  </S>",
