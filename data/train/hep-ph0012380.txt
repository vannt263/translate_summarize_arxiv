    "recently a lot of attention has been paid to deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs )  @xcite .",
    "it was realized that there exists a close relation with the problem of a proton spin carried by gluons and quarks .",
    "indeed the decomposition of the nonforward compton scattering amplitude for the case when one of photons on - mass shell and another one is off - mass shell contains fifteen structure functions and four out of them could be put to the test  @xcite .",
    "their first moments determine the dirac , pauli , axial - vector and pseudoscalar formfactors of a proton while their second moments are related with a proton spin fraction carried out by quarks and gluons and the orbital momenta of the latter .",
    "these structure functions can be tested in dis experiments with longitudinally polarized initial lepton aimed at measuring the azimuthal correlation between a real photon and scattered lepton .",
    "there are two mechanisms of photon emission , namely the emission from lepton ( bethe - heitler ) and quark lines .",
    "the last option may be split up into two gauge - invariant mechanisms : emission off a valence quark of a proton and emission from a quark - antiquark pair produced by a virtual photon and a gluon out of a proton . for the case of small angle scattering (",
    "the limit of small bjorken variable ) the leading nonvanishing in the limit of high cms energies contribution arises from the last mechanism that we call the impact factor ( if ) mechanism which is thought of as the amplitude of virtual photon conversion into real photon in the gluonic field of a proton .",
    "the effect of azimuthal correlation appears as the interference of the real bethe - heitler amplitude with the pure imaginary one of if mechanism of real photon creation .",
    "the interference is not zero due to pure imaginary spin density matrix of the polarized lepton .",
    "the azimuthal asymmetry we d like to obtain has the simplest form @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the azimuthal angle between the planes formed by the momenta of initial and scattered leptons and an initial lepton and photon .",
    "it was shown that the higher harmonics in the fourier decomposition of the asymmetry are related with the structure functions mentioned above .",
    "the contribution derived here is sensitive only to the gluon density @xmath3 inside a proton . for small values of energy fraction",

    "in which an initial proton is unpolarized and the final states are a scattered lepton , a recoil proton and a hard photon from the fragmentation region of initial lepton .",
    "furthermore the lowest order contribution ( @xmath6 ) to the asymmetry is dealt with .",
    "the higher pt effects were considered in the paper  @xcite and took into account the bfkl ladder .",
    "let s consider the radiative electron - proton scattering , @xmath7 where we indicate in parenthesis the 4-momenta of particles , @xmath8 is the degree of the longitudinal polarization of electron .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the kinematics where the absolute magnitude of a square of momentum transfer between initial and final state electrons is small with respect to the cms energy squared , @xmath9 the main contribution non - vanishing in the limit of large @xmath10 arises from the two feynman amplitudes .",

    "the quantities @xmath18,\\ d_1=-x_1[(p_1-k_1)^2-m_e^2],\\ q^2,\\ ] ] can be re - expressed using the sudakov decomposition of the 4-vectors , @xmath19 where @xmath20 are the two - dimensional transverse to the beam axis components of photon , scattered electron and recoil proton momenta which obey the conservation law @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are the energy fractions of the scattered electron and real photon satisfying @xmath23 .",
    "the corresponding modulus of the matrix element squared and summed over polarization states and the cross section can be brought to the form  @xcite , @xmath24 it is important to note that the amplitude @xmath25 is real .",
    "consider now the 2-loop level correction to the amplitude studied above , describing emission of a hard photon from the intermediate state of a pair of charged quarks created by the virtual photon and converted to the real one through the two gluons exchange .",
    "the corresponding amplitude differs from the qed one only by the factor @xmath26 ( @xmath27 is a quark charge in units of @xmath28 ) and the gluon density factor @xmath29 ( see ref .",
