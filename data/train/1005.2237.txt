    "recently , observational informations concerning on the binary systems in the globular cluster have been accumulated from photometric observations of the eclipses ( e.g. @xcite ) , spectroscopic observations ( e.g. @xcite ) , low - mass x - ray binaries ( see @xcite ) , and also the color - magnitude diagrams ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite also constrain the binary fraction in ngc 6397 by the method of the color - magnitude diagrams , and review the binary fractions in galactic globular clusters .    the binaries in the globular cluster play important roles for its dynamical evolution , since the binaries work as energy source through interactions with other stars or binaries ( @xcite ) . even if the globular cluster has no binary at initial ,",
    "the binaries are formed in due course through three - body encounter , and energy generated from these binaries halts core collapse of the globular cluster ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , if the globular cluster contains a nonnegligible fraction of primordial binaries , the dynamical evolution could be affected .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter gh89 ) first showed theoretically difference of evolutions with and without primordial binary .",
    "gh89 estimated that the core of the cluster with primordial binaries at the halt of core contraction is larger than that of the cluster without primordial binaries by order of magnitudes .",
    "gh89 s estimate is based on the model that the cluster core stop contracting when energy generated by the primordial binaries is balanced with energy outflowing from the inner region of the cluster to the outer region through two - body relaxation .",
    "mcmillan et al . ( 1990 ; 1991 ) first performed @xmath0-body simulations of clusters with primordial binaries .",
    "they clearly showed that the cluster cores stop contracting at larger cores than those without primordial binaries . by means of fokker - planck model , @xcite investigated post - collapse evolution of cluster with the primordial binary .",
    "they showed that the cores of the clusters continues to contract slowly after rapid core contraction and that the gravothermal oscillations occur after the several ten half - mass relaxation time of the slow core contraction .    in order to set a population of the primordial binaries in the cluster , several parameters concerning",
    "the binary and its distributions , such as mass fraction , and distribution of binding energies and eccentricities , need to be specified .",
    "although these parameters should be derived from theories of star and cluster formations or be limited observationally , sufficient informations have not yet been provided at present .",
    "only a few studies investigated the effect of these parameters on the evolution .",
    "@xcite performed @xmath0-body simulations of clusters with two different mass fractions , @xmath7 and @xmath8 % , of primordial binaries , and @xcite investigated the evolutions of clusters with @xmath9 % mass fraction of primordial binaries by means of @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter vc94 ) extended the model of gh89 , taking into account the core mass fraction of primordial binaries and the distribution of the binding energies of the binaries .    in this paper , we focus on the dependence on binding energies of the primordial binaries . by means of @xmath0-body simulations ,",
    "we systematically investigate the dynamical evolution of clusters with different initial hardness of binding energies .",
    "we set the distribution of binding energies of primordial binaries by delta function , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the initial binding energies of the primordial binaries and @xmath12 .",
    "here , @xmath3 is the average kinetic energy of stars in the cluster at the initial time . in previous simulations ,",
    "the distribution of the binding energy of the primordial binaries are usually fixed at uniform distributions in @xmath13 ( see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we found that the evolutions of the cores are different according to the distribution of the binding energies .",
    "if primordial binaries consist of softer binaries , the binaries are disrupted before core collapse through binary - single and binary - binary encounters , and do not affect the core evolution . if primordial binaries consist of harder binaries , the binaries escape from the cluster .",
    "this is because energy generated by the harder binaries per one encounter is larger than the cluster potential .",
    "they also do not affect the core evolution and the cluster exhibits deep core collapse .",
    "in intermediate range , the binaries efficiently heat the clusters , and the core collapses of the clusters halt halfway .",
    "these behaviors are consistent with the theoretical estimate by vc94 .",
    "these behaviors were not shown by previous works ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) who followed the dynamical evolution of clusters with primordial binaries .",
    "this is mainly because the previous works fixed the distributions of the binding energies of the primordial binaries at uniform distributions in @xmath13 , and their fixed distributions include binaries with hardness in soft , intermediate , and hard ranges .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "we describe simulation methods in section [ sec : sim ] . in section [ sec : results ] , we present results of simulations and investigate the effect of the hardness of primordial binaries on the dynamical evolution of clusters . in section [ sec : summary ] , we summarize this paper .",

    "<S> we investigate effects of hardness of primordial binaries on whole evolution of star clusters by means of @xmath0-body simulations . using newly developed code , gorilla , we simulated eleven @xmath1 clusters with primordial binaries whose binding energies are equal in each cluster in range of @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is average stellar kinetic energy at the initial time . </S>",
    "<S> we found that , in both soft ( @xmath4 ) and hard ( @xmath5 ) limits , clusters experience deep core collapse . in the intermediate hardness ( @xmath6 ) , the core collapses halt halfway due to an energy releases of the primordial binaries . the core radii at the halt can be explained by their energy budget . </S>"
