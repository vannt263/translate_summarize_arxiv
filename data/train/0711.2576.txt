    "s three series theorem , @xmath10 a.s .",
    "if and only if @xmath11 under this condition , we study the small deviation problem , also called small ball problem , or lower tail probability problem for @xmath4 : @xmath12    there has been a lot of interest in small deviation problems in recent years ( cf .  the surveys by and ) .",
    "the question of small deviations of sums was first addressed by , , and for gaussian random variables .",
    "later , this was generalized by ( see also references therein ) , , and for random variables @xmath13 with finite variance . then , , and , most recently , and , give general treatments only under the necessary and sufficient condition ( [ eqn:3series ] ) .",
    "the case of _ polynomial _ decrease of @xmath7 seems to be almost completely understood by now thanks to .",
    "the latter paper shows that there are different regimes in the sense that if @xmath7 decreases slowly enough ( in relation to the lower tail of @xmath13 ) then that order of decrease determines the lower tail of @xmath4 .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath7 decreases sufficiently fast then the lower tail of @xmath13 determines the lower tail of @xmath4 .    in this note , we study the case of _ exponential _ decrease of @xmath7 , which is considered by under the assumption @xmath14 and @xmath13 absolutely continuous , and with similar conditions to ours by .",
    "here we continue the theme from , , and and investigate ( [ eqn : p ] ) under minimal assumptions .",
    "this must necessarily yield less precise assertions .",
    "in particular , we confine ourselves to the logarithmic order of the small deviations .",
    "contrary to this , the early works for this problem mentioned above focussed on solving ( [ eqn : p ] ) for particular distributions or under restrictive assumptions , such as finite variance , which could then yield very precise results such as the strong asymptotic order of ( [ eqn : p ] ) .",
    "we are going to use the following notation for strong and weak asymptotics : we write @xmath15 , if @xmath16 .",
    "analogously , @xmath17 is defined .",
    "furthermore , @xmath18 means @xmath19 .",
    "we also use @xmath20 if @xmath21 .",
    "as already mentioned , we consider the special case that @xmath22 with some @xmath2 . in order to get the logarithmic order of ( [ eqn : p ] ) it is , in most cases , sufficient to treat @xmath23 .",
    "we come back to this question in remark  [ rem : simplif ] .",
    "i.e.  we consider @xmath24 in view of ( [ eqn:3series ] ) , we need to assume that the necessary and sufficient condition for the problem to be well - posed , @xmath25 holds , which we do in the following .",
    "this is the only condition imposed on the upper tail of @xmath13 in this paper .",
    "note that this condition does not depend on @xmath26 , i.e.  on the sequence @xmath7 , unlike in the polynomial case , cf .  , , or .",
    "the main argument in this note ( presented in section  [ sec : main ] ) allows to calculate the logarithmic small deviation order and constant for @xmath4 from ( [ eqn : s1 ] ) for basically all commonly considered distributions .",
    "furthermore , this can be extended to determine the small deviation order of the supremum @xmath5 given by @xmath27 , which surprisingly leads to the same rate in many cases .    apart from presenting the new results related to the small deviations of @xmath4 and @xmath5 with exponentially decreasing weights , this note has the purpose of giving a simple illustration of the general treatment of the small deviations of @xmath4 from ( [ eqn : s ] ) .",
    "namely , to the knowledge of the author this case is the easiest example that shows how the problem is tackled , in particular , how fruitful the use of tauberian theorems is in this context .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : main ] , we present the strikingly simple main argument that helps us to solve the small deviation problem for @xmath4 from ( [ eqn : s1 ] ) . in section  [ sec : app ] , several examples are given under various conditions for the lower tail of @xmath13 .",
    "we continue in section  [ sec : sup ] with a comparison to the small deviations of the supremum @xmath5 .",
    "section  [ sec : final ] provides the necessary tauberian - type arguments and a final comment .",
    "the main argument is very simple . recall that considering small deviations is equivalent to considering laplace transforms at infinity , by the use of tauberianian - type theorems , cf .   and lemma  [ lem : app ] below .",
    "let us define @xmath28 the goal is to deduce the behaviour of @xmath29 from the behaviour of @xmath30 .",
    "note that in this particular case , ( [ eqn : s1 ] ) yields @xmath31 this implies , by the independence of the @xmath32 s , @xmath33 .",
    "we iterate this and obtain that , for all @xmath34 , @xmath35 note that , when @xmath36 , one can choose @xmath37 such that @xmath38 .",
    "then @xmath39 .",
    "we summarise :    [ lem : thelem ] for any @xmath40 , @xmath41    note that @xmath42 is independent of @xmath43 .",
    "thus , one can determine the asymptotics of @xmath29 at infinity completely from the behaviour of @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "we are going to apply this lemma in several examples .    for concrete distributions",
    ", @xmath30 can be calculated explicitly ; and lemma  [ lem : thelem ] turns the small deviation problem into an easy calculation exercise .",
    "if only the asymptotics of the lower tail of the distribution of @xmath13 is given , one can obtain the behaviour of @xmath30 at infinity , and thus the one of @xmath29 via ( [ eqn : fg2 ] ) .",
    "recall from that in the case of polynomially decreasing sequences @xmath7 in ( [ eqn : s ] ) , it is possible to treat the small deviation problem for @xmath4 analogously to the small deviation problem for @xmath46 .",
    "note that this is not possible with the current approach , since the technique relies on ( [ eqn : trick ] ) .",
    "however , we come to the supremum case in section  [ sec : sup ] .",
    "we finally point out that lemma  [ lem : thelem ] does not require any other condition apart from the necessary and sufficient condition for the problem to make sense , ( [ eqn : starns ] ) , which ensures the finiteness of all expressions .",
    "we start with the case when @xmath13 has a positive mass at the origin .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath30 tending to a constant .",
    "let @xmath47 .",
    "then @xmath48 [ thm : a3 ]    if @xmath13 has positive mass at zero @xmath49 .",
    "note that in particular , @xmath50 for all @xmath43 .",
    "this together with ( [ eqn : fg2 ] ) shows that @xmath51    the proof of the lower bound is as follows .",
    "first , let us define @xmath52 by @xmath53 .",
    "note that @xmath52 is non - positive and increasing and that @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , @xmath55 now lhospital s rule shows that the last term divided by @xmath56 tends to zero , since @xmath54 .",
    "this yields that @xmath57 .",
    "thus , we finally obtain that @xmath58 , and the assertion follows from lemma  [ lem : app ] .    as an illustrative example consider bernoulli random variables given by @xmath59 and @xmath60 . in this case , @xmath4 is uniformly distributed in @xmath61 $ ] and equality holds for all @xmath62 in ( [ eqn : sdd ] ) .    however",
    ", if we take for @xmath13 a distribution that has sufficiently heavy tails and a mass at zero , none of the results in the literature applies .",
    "now , we continue with the result under the assumption that the distribution function of @xmath13 behaves essentially as a polynomial for small values .",
    "this corresponds to the case of logarithmic increase of @xmath30 .",
    "let @xmath63 , as @xmath64 , for some @xmath65 . then @xmath66 [ thm : a1 ]    the assumption for the lower tail of @xmath13 implies that @xmath67 , as @xmath68 .",
    "the monotonicity of @xmath30 implies that there are constants @xmath69 such that @xmath70 from ( [ eqn : fg2 ] ) we deduce that @xmath71 after a short calculation one can see that the strong asymptotic order of the right hand side , when @xmath72 , is @xmath73 .",
    "analogous arguments show the lower bound .",
    "i.e.  we obtain @xmath74 finally we use lemma  [ lem : app ] .",
    "this theorem is proved by ; however , the present method uses a significantly simpler proof .",
    "also , a stronger version of this theorem was proved by for rational @xmath75 and with a stronger assumption for the lower tail of @xmath13 .    with essentially the same proof",
    ", one can show even more .",
    "namely , assume that @xmath76 , as @xmath64 , where @xmath65 and @xmath77 is a slowly varying function at infinity that is bounded away from @xmath78 and @xmath79 on every compact subset of @xmath80",
    ". then ( [ eqn : addsvt ] ) holds .",
    "in particular , @xmath77 has no influence on the order , cf .  .    as main examples",
    "one can consider @xmath81 for gaussian random variables @xmath82 or symmetric stable random variables @xmath82 ( in both of which cases @xmath83 ) .",
    "one can as well consider @xmath13 with a gamma distribution , weibull distribution , etc .",
    "recall that consider the most important case @xmath82 standard normal and @xmath84 and give much more precise estimates .",
    "however , for random variables with a heavy tail ( e.g.  the mentioned stables ) the above result seems to be new .",
    "using essentially the same technique as in the proof of theorem  [ thm : a1 ] one also tackles the case when @xmath85 is some other slowly varying function .",
    "for example , in the case that @xmath86 is log normal one obtains in this way that @xmath87 , as @xmath64 .      finally , we consider the case that @xmath13 has exponentially little mass near the origin .",
    "this corresponds to the case of polynomial increase of @xmath30 .",
    "let @xmath88 , as @xmath64 , for some @xmath89 and @xmath90 . then @xmath91 [ thm : a2 ]    from the assumption we deduce , by , theorem  4.12.9 , that @xmath92 , as @xmath68 , where @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "from ( [ eqn : fg2 ] ) we deduce in a similar fashion as in the proof of theorem  [ thm : a1 ] that @xmath95 again by , theorem  4.12.9 , we conclude the proof .",
    "a similar result holds if we add a slowly varying term in the asymptotics of the lower tail of @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , one can prove an analogous result under the assumption that @xmath96 .    under",
    "only slightly stronger assumptions obtained the same result .",
    "an example that fits perfectly into the situation of theorem  [ thm : a2 ] is the inverse weibull distribution , that has exponentially little mass near the origin and a heavy tail .    as another illustrative example consider a stable totally skewed random variable @xmath82 , i.e.  a positive random variable with laplace transform @xmath97 , with @xmath90 and @xmath98 , cf .  .",
    "these random variables are @xmath99-stable and have exponentially little mass near the origin . theorem  [ thm : a2 ] can be applied to @xmath100 , where @xmath101 .",
    "note that in the case @xmath102 the sum @xmath4 is also a stable random variable , which makes it easy to verify the constant occuring in ( [ eqn : mexca1 ] ) .",
    "[ exa : stable ]",
    "in this section , we give an extension and comparison to the small deviations of the supremum .",
    "namely , we consider the small deviation problem for @xmath103 when @xmath104 .",
    "surprisingly , we obtain the same small deviation rate for @xmath5 and @xmath4 in the setup considered in section  [ sec : app ] .",
    "this contrasts the results for the cases when @xmath7 is polynomially decreasing , where the small deviation rates for @xmath5 and @xmath4 are always distinct , cf .  .",
    "let us start with the case when @xmath13 has a positive mass at the origin considered in theorem  [ thm : a3 ] .",
    "the resulting small deviation rate and constant are the same for @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath47 .",
    "then @xmath105 [ thm : a3sup ]    since @xmath106 , we only have to show an upper bound for @xmath107 .",
    "let @xmath108 .",
    "since the distribution function @xmath109 is cdlg , there is a @xmath110 such that @xmath111 .",
    "let @xmath112 and choose the maximal @xmath113 such that @xmath114 , i.e.  asymptotically , when @xmath64 , @xmath115 .",
    "then , by the independence of the @xmath32 s , @xmath116 if we let @xmath117 tend to zero , we obtain @xmath118 for all @xmath108 .",
    "we let @xmath119 to finish the proof .",
    "we continue with the case considered in theorem  [ thm : a1 ] . here",
    "again we find that @xmath5 and @xmath4 have the same small deviation rate and constant .",
    "let @xmath63 , as @xmath64 , for some @xmath65 . then @xmath120 [ thm : a1sup ]    in view of the trivial fact that @xmath106 , we only have to show an upper bound for @xmath107 .",
    "note that @xmath121 for any @xmath34 .",
    "we choose the largest @xmath122 such that @xmath123 , i.e. , as @xmath64 , @xmath124 .",
    "then , by assumption , the last term is less than @xmath125 for some constant @xmath126 depending only on the lower tail of @xmath13 .",
    "a short calculation shows that the asymptotic order of this term , as @xmath64 , is indeed @xmath127 , as asserted .",
    "we finish with the case considered in theorem  [ thm : a2 ] , where @xmath13 has exponentially little mass near the origin . here , the small deviation rates for @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the same , however , the small deviation constants differ ( compare the constants in  ( [ eqn : mexca1 ] ) and  ( [ eqn : mexca2 ] ) ) .",
    "[ thm : a2sup ] let @xmath88 , as @xmath64 , for some @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "then @xmath128    let @xmath1290,1[$ ] . by assumption , there is a @xmath130 such that for all @xmath112 , @xmath131    let @xmath112 .",
    "we choose the maximal @xmath132 such that @xmath133 and the maximal @xmath134 such that @xmath135 .",
    "note that @xmath136 let us look at the first term in ( [ eqn : lasth ] ) . using ( [ eqn : eosp ] ) we estimate it from above by@xmath137 as @xmath64 .",
    "analogously , the respective lower bound ( with @xmath138 ) follows .",
    "let us look at the second term in ( [ eqn : lasth ] ) .",
    "we use the assumption to estimate @xmath139 which holds for some constant @xmath140 only depending on the lower tail of @xmath86 . by the choice of @xmath141 and @xmath142 ,",
    "the last term can be estimated from above by @xmath143 finally we come to the third term in ( [ eqn : lasth ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath144 where we used that @xmath145 for @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "when @xmath64 , the last term is of order @xmath148 this equals @xmath149 , which is the finite constant from ( [ eqn : starns ] ) .",
    "therefore , putting the three estimates together , @xmath150 as @xmath64 , for all @xmath151 .",
    "letting @xmath152 gives the upper bound .",
    "the lower bound is established in exactly the same way .",
    "let us finally provide the mentioned tauberian - type arguments .",
    "the proof is along the same lines of the proof of theorem  4.12.9 in .",
    "we refer e.g.  to , lemma  6.1 , and the reference mentioned there .",
    "[ rem : simplif ] finally , let us comment on whether @xmath156 can be replaced by @xmath104 .",
    "several authors have investigated this question , cf .",
    ", , , , or .",
    "in fact , using the technique from the proof of lemma  4.1 in it is easy to see that in the situation of theorems  [ thm : a3 ] , [ thm : a1 ] , [ thm : a3sup ] , and  [ thm : a1sup ] the assumption @xmath104 can be replaced w.l.o.g .  by @xmath104 .",
    "contrary to this , for theorems  [ thm : a2 ] and  [ thm : a2sup ] it is not sufficient to assume @xmath156 as one can see easily from the stable sum in example  [ exa : stable ] or the proof of theorem  [ thm : a2sup ] .",
    "nevertheless , here the proof of theorem  [ thm : a2sup ] also serves in the general case . in the case of the sum",
