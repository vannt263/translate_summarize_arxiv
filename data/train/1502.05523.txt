    "the study of the antiproton ",
    "nucleus interaction is an interesting issue which has attracted renewed interest in recent years at the prospect of future experiments at the fair facility .",
    "the @xmath0nuclear bound states and the possibility of their formation have been studied in refs .",
    "these considerations are supported by a strongly attractive potential that the @xmath0 feels in the nuclear medium . within the rmf approach the real part of the @xmath0nucleus potential derived using the g - parity transformation is re@xmath1  mev deep at normal nuclear density . however , the experiments with @xmath0 atoms @xcite and @xmath0 scattering off nuclei at low energies @xcite favor shallower real part of the @xmath0nucleus potential in the range of @xmath2  mev in the nuclear interior .",
    "an important aspect of the @xmath0nucleus interaction is @xmath0 annihilation which appears to be the dominant part of the interaction .",
    "nevertheless , the phase space for the annihilation products should be significantly suppressed for the antiproton bound deeply in the nuclear medium , which could lead to the relatively long living @xmath0 inside the nucleus  @xcite .    in this contribution",
    ", we report on our recent fully self - consistent calculations of @xmath0nuclear bound states including @xmath0 absorption in a nucleus .",
    "the calculations are performed within the rmf model @xcite .",
    "dynamical effects in the nuclear core caused by the antiproton and the phase space suppression for the @xmath0 annihilation products are studied for various nuclei .    in section 2",
    ", we briefly introduce the underlying model .",
    "few selected representative results of our calculations are discussed in section 3 .",
    "the @xmath0nucleus interaction is described within the rmf approach . the interaction among ( anti)nucleons",
    "is mediated by the exchange of the scalar ( @xmath3 ) and vector ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) meson fields , and the massless photon field @xmath6 .",
    "the standard lagrangian density @xmath7 for nucleonic sector is extended by the lagrangian density @xmath8 describing the antiproton interaction with the nuclear medium ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "the variational principle yields the equations of motion for the hadron fields involved .",
    "the dirac equations for nucleons and antiproton read : @xmath9\\psi_j^{\\alpha}=\\epsilon_j^{\\alpha } \\psi_j^{\\alpha } ,   \\quad j = n,\\bar{p}~,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 are the scalar and vector potentials . here , @xmath11 stands for ( anti)nucleon mass ; @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are the ( anti)nucleon couplings to corresponding fields , and @xmath14 denotes single particle states . the klein ",
    "gordon equations for the boson fields acquire additional source terms due to the presence of @xmath0 : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the scalar , vector , isovector , and charge densities , respectively , and @xmath18 are the masses of the considered mesons . in this work , the nucleon  meson coupling constants and meson masses were adopted from the nonlinear rmf model tm1(2 ) @xcite for heavy ( light ) nuclei .",
    "the system of the coupled dirac and klein  gordon equations is solved fully self - consistently by iterative procedure .",
    "+ in the rmf model , the nucleon in a nucleus moves in mean fields created by all nucleons , i.  e. , the nucleon feels repulsion as well as attraction also from itself . in ordinary nuclei",
    "this nucleon self - interaction has only a minor ( @xmath19 ) effect .",
    "however , the potential acting on @xmath0 in a nucleus is much deeper and the impact of the @xmath0 self - interaction could become pronounced . in order to exclude this unphysical @xmath0 self - interaction we omitted the antiproton source terms in the klein ",
    "gordon equations for the boson fields acting on the @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath0nucleus interaction is constructed from the @xmath20nucleus interaction with the help of the g - parity transformation : the vector potential generated by the @xmath21 meson exchange thus changes its sign and becomes attractive . as a consequence",
    ", the total @xmath0 potential will be strongly attractive .",
    "however , the g - parity transformation should be regarded as a mere starting point to determine the @xmath0meson coupling constants .",
    "various many - body effects , as well as the presence of strong annihilation channels could cause significant deviations from the g - parity values in the nuclear medium . therefore ,",
    "we introduce a scaling factor @xmath22 for the @xmath0meson coupling constants @xcite : @xmath23    the @xmath0 annihilation in the nuclear medium is described by the imaginary part of the optical potential in a ` @xmath24 ' form adopted from optical model phenomenology @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the @xmath0nucleus reduced mass . while the density @xmath27 was treated as a dynamical quantity evaluated within the rmf model , the parameter im@xmath28  fm was determined by fitting the @xmath0 atom data @xcite .",
    "the energy available for the @xmath0 annihilation in the nuclear medium is usually expressed as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the @xmath0 and nucleon binding energy , respectively .",
    "the phase space available for the annihilation products is thus considerably suppressed for the deeply bound antiproton .    the nuclear core density distribution in @xmath32ca and @xmath32ca@xmath33 for @xmath34 , calculated in the tm1 model . the @xmath0 density distribution in @xmath32ca@xmath33 ( dotted line )",
    "is shown for comparison . ]    the nuclear core density distribution in @xmath32ca and @xmath32ca@xmath33 for @xmath34 , calculated in the tm1 model .",
    "the @xmath0 density distribution in @xmath32ca@xmath33 ( dotted line ) is shown for comparison . ]",
    "the phase space suppression factor @xmath35 for two body decay is given by @xcite @xmath36[s-(m_1-m_2)^2]}{[m^2-(m_1+m_2)][m^2-(m_1-m_2)^2]}}\\theta(\\sqrt{s}-m_1-m_2)~,\\ ] ] where @xmath37 , @xmath38 are the masses of the annihilation products and @xmath39 . for channels containing more than 2 particles in the final state",
    "the @xmath35 was evaluated with the help of the monte carlo simulation tool pluto  @xcite .",
    "the formalism introduced above was employed in the self - consistent calculations of the @xmath0 bound states in selected nuclei .",
    "first , we did not consider the @xmath0 annihilation in the nuclear medium and focused on the study of the dynamical effects caused by the presence of the antiproton in the nucleus . during our calculations we noticed a pronounced effect of the @xmath0 self - interaction on the calculated observables . in fig .",
    "[ fig . : selfinteraction ] , we present the @xmath0 density distribution in @xmath40pb , calculated dynamically in the tm1 model for different values of the scaling parameter @xmath41 . the central @xmath0 density @xmath42 calculated including the @xmath0 self - interaction ( left panel ) reaches its maximum for @xmath43 and then starts to decrease .",
    "it is due to the interplay between the negative value of @xmath44 ( absolute value of which increases with @xmath41 ) , the @xmath0 single particle energy , and the @xmath0 rest mass , which affects the solution of the dirac equation for the @xmath0 wave function . on the other hand , when the @xmath0 self - interaction is subtracted ( right panel ) , the scalar and vector potentials are of comparable depth and the @xmath42 increases gradually with @xmath41 and saturates at much higher values .",
    "it is to be stressed that the effect of the @xmath0 self - interaction is negligible for @xmath45 , which includes the @xmath0 potentials consistent with @xmath0 atom data .",
    "our calculations revealed large polarization of the nuclear core caused by the @xmath0 in the nuclear @xmath46 state .",
    "the nuclear core density in a @xmath0 nucleus reaches @xmath47 times the nuclear matter density as illustrated for @xmath32ca in fig .",
    "[ fig . : density ] .",
    "the @xmath0 is localized in the center of the nucleus and the resultant nuclear core density is substantially enhanced over a small region , @xmath48  fm .",
    "the nucleon single particle energies are affected by the presence of the @xmath0 as well .",
    "consequently the total binding energies of @xmath0 nuclei increase considerably , @xmath49  mev for @xmath32ca and @xmath50  mev for @xmath32ca+@xmath0 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "upper components @xmath51 ( left ) and the relation for lower components @xmath52 ( right ) of the @xmath53 and @xmath54 @xmath0 wave functions in @xmath55o , calculated dynamically in the tm2 model using the real ( no abs ) and complex ( + abs ) @xmath0 potential . ]    upper components @xmath51 ( left ) and the relation for lower components @xmath52 ( right ) of the @xmath53 and @xmath54 @xmath0 wave functions in @xmath55o , calculated dynamically in the tm2 model using the real ( no abs ) and complex ( + abs ) @xmath0 potential . ]    in order to account for @xmath0 annihilation , we performed calculations using the complex potential presented in section  2 .",
    "we considered the suppression of the phase space for the annihilation products . in fig .",
    "[ fig . : sf ] , the phase space suppression factors for the annihilation channels involved are presented as a function of @xmath56 . as @xmath56 decreases due to the @xmath0 and @xmath57 binding energies many channels become strongly suppressed or even closed .",
    "moreover , the @xmath0nucleon annihilation takes place in the nuclear medium .",
    "therefore , the momentum dependent term in the mandelstam variable @xmath58 , where @xmath59 , is non - negligible in contrast to the two body frame @xcite . our self - consistent evaluation of @xmath56 including @xmath60 and @xmath61 leads to an additional downward energy shift overlooked by many previous calculations .",
    "in table [ tab . : results ] , we present the @xmath46 @xmath0 single particle energies and widths in @xmath55o+@xmath0 , calculated using the real and complex potentials consistent with @xmath0-atom data ( @xmath34 ) . to illustrate the role of the suppression factors @xmath62 we show the results of calculations without @xmath62 ( ` complex ' ) , as well as including @xmath62 for @xmath56 due to @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( ` complex+@xmath62 ' ) and for @xmath56 with the additional downward energy shift due to the momenta of annihilating partners ( ` + @xmath63 ' ) .",
    "the static calculations , which do not account for the core polarization effects , give approximately the same values of the @xmath0 single particle energy for all cases .",
    "the single particle energies calculated dynamically are larger , which indicates that the polarization of the core nucleus is significant . when the phase space suppression is taken into account the @xmath0 width is reduced by more than twice ( compare ` complex ' and ` complex+@xmath62 ' in the last row of table [ tab . : results ] ) .",
    "when treating @xmath56 self - consistently including the @xmath0 and @xmath57 momenta , the @xmath0 width is reduced by additional @xmath64  mev , but still remains sizeable .",
    "the corresponding lifetime of the @xmath0 in the nucleus is @xmath65  fm .",
