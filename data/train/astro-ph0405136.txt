    "analyses of galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) have demonstrated two distinct bimodalities in galaxy properties : a bimodality between recent - burst dominated and more continuous star formation histories ( sfhs ) as a function of stellar mass @xmath5 , divided at @xmath6 m@xmath4 @xcite , and a bimodality between blue late - type and red early - type galaxy sequences as a function of optical color , divided at @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite have partially unified these observations , demonstrating a color transition within each of the two galaxy sequences at @xmath8 m@xmath4 , as well as an increase in the relative number density of red sequence galaxies above @xmath125@xmath9 m@xmath4 .",
    "they also argue that the number density of the red sequence is consistent with a major - merger origin .",
    "however , the cause of the color and sfh transitions at @xmath123@xmath9 m@xmath4 remains to be explained .",
    "several physical processes that influence sfhs may imprint a transition mass on the galaxy population .",
    "supernova - driven gas blow - away will preferentially affect halos with small escape velocities @xcite , although simulations suggest that the baryonic mass threshold for blow - away may be closer to @xmath10 m@xmath4 than to @xmath11 m@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "cold - mode gas accretion may dominate in low - mass halos whose gas fails to shock to the virial temperature @xcite ; here analytic estimates give a threshold mass of a few times @xmath12 m@xmath4 including dark matter , so a link to the observed transition at @xmath13 23 @xmath9 m@xmath4 is plausible .",
    "finally , observations suggest that inefficient star formation may be typical of disk - dominated galaxies with @xmath14 , possibly reflecting the relative importance of supernova feedback as opposed to other turbulence drivers in supporting the interstellar medium against gravitational instability @xcite .",
    "all of these processes involve gas  its expulsion , accretion , or rate of consumption . thus examining",
    "how the gas properties of galaxies vary with color and stellar mass may offer vital clues to the origin of the transition mass and the color shifts within the red and blue sequences .",
    "unfortunately , tracing the dominant neutral phase of the interstellar medium requires hi 21-cm line observations , which are challenging even at the modest redshifts probed by the sdss . to make full use of the statistical power of the sdss",
    ", an alternate strategy is required .",
    "building on earlier optical work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xcite has shown a remarkably tight correlation between hi mass - to-@xmath15-band luminosity ratios and @xmath16 colors .",
    "going one step further , the present work describes a method for estimating atomic - gas - to - stellar mass ratios using @xmath0 colors from the sdss and two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) databases .",
    "this `` photometric gas fraction '' technique is calibrated using hi data from the recently expanded hyperleda hi catalog . when the technique is applied to a sample of @xmath135,000 sdss-2mass galaxies at @xmath17 , the transition mass of 23@xmath9 m@xmath4",
    "is observed to correspond to a shift in gas richness found separately in both galaxy color sequences .",
    "this result implies that any explanation of the transition mass via gas physics must directly or indirectly affect both early- and late - type galaxies .",
    "optical , near - ir , and hi data were obtained from the sdss second data release ( dr2 , * ? ? ? * ) , the 2mass all - sky extended source catalog ( xsc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the hyperleda homogenized hi catalog @xcite .",
    "merged catalogs were constructed containing all @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 galaxies with positions matched to within 6@xmath20 and with reliable redshifts and magnitudes based on data flags and cataloged errors ( magnitude errors @xmath21 in @xmath22 , @xmath23 in hi , and @xmath24 in @xmath25 ) .",
    "the 2mass magnitude limit was set fainter than the completeness limit to improve statistics on dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies .",
    "as the 2mass xsc has uneven depth , it probes significantly fainter than the completeness limit in some areas of the sky .",
    "because of their marginal detectability , galaxies with hi - derived gas - to - stellar mass ratios greater than two were targeted for individual inspection , and eight were rejected as having unreliable 2mass or sdss pipeline reductions .",
    "these rejections exacerbate the shortage of ir - faint galaxies .",
    "the final samples are : sdss - hyperleda ( 575 galaxies ) , sdss-2mass - hyperleda ( 346 galaxies ) , and sdss-2mass ( 35,166 galaxies ) .",
    "an additional requirement for the sdss-2mass sample was that the local group motion - corrected redshift be greater than 1000 .",
    "all optical and ir magnitudes used here are fitted magnitudes , i.e.  sdss model magnitudes and 2mass extrapolated total magnitudes .",
    "the sdss magnitudes are corrected for galactic extinction using the dr2 tabulated values and k - corrected to redshift zero using * kcorrect v3.2 * @xcite , while the 2mass @xmath22-band magnitudes are k - corrected using @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "distances are computed in the concordance cosmology @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "[ fg : both]a shows the basic correlation between @xmath30-band and 21-cm apparent magnitudes @xmath31 and @xmath32 for the sdss - hyperleda sample .",
    "its existence is not surprising : @xmath30-band light is a tracer of young massive stars , and the birth rate of young stars is known to depend on the available gas reservoir ( as in the global correlation between disk - averaged star formation rate and gas surface density , * ? ? ?",
    "the presence of young massive stars may also enhance hi detection ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the absolute magnitude correlation obtained by distance - correcting @xmath31 and @xmath32 is of course far stronger than the correlation in fig .  [ fg : both]a , but at the cost of non - independent axes . in any case , what is relevant for predicting @xmath32 from @xmath31 is not correlation strength but scatter .",
    "most of the 0.92 mag scatter in the @xmath31@xmath32 relation is not explained by the errors .",
    "this scatter likely represents variations in @xmath30-band extinction , molecular - to - atomic gas ratios , and the physical conditions required to convert a gas reservoir into young stars .",
    "even without calibrating these factors , the @xmath31@xmath32 relation is sufficiently tight for the present application .    figs .",
    "[ fg : both]b and  [ fg : both]c plot atomic - gas - to - stellar mass ratios ( g / s ) against @xmath33 and @xmath0 colors for the sdss-2mass - hyperleda sample .",
    "gas masses are derived from hi fluxes with a helium correction factor of 1.4 , and stellar masses are derived from @xmath22-band fluxes using stellar mass - to - light ( m / l ) ratios estimated from @xmath34 colors as in @xcite .",
    "the resulting correlations are distance - independent and extremely strong , with spearman rank correlation coefficients of 0.75 and 0.69 for @xmath0 and @xmath33 respectively .",
    "note that the calibration sample spans the color@xmath5 relation ( fig .",
    "[ fg : colormass]a ) , and the color",
    " g / s relation is tighter than the color@xmath5 relation for these galaxies by @xmath125% in both @xmath0 and @xmath33 . the strength of the @xmath0 color ",
    "g / s relation derives both from the underlying @xmath31@xmath32 relation and from the close correspondence between @xmath22-band light and stellar mass .",
    "the latter correspondence is assumed within this work and may not apply to all starbursting systems @xcite ; however , @xcite find that spectroscopically determined m / l ratios generally agree well with color - based m / l ratios , even in the low - mass regime where starbursts are common .    the large dynamic range of the @xmath0 color ",
    "g / s relation makes the relation forgiving of errors and thus well - suited to low - precision estimation of photometric gas fractions .",
    "the 0.37 dex scatter in the relation provides a basis for error estimation .",
    "furthermore , galaxies of low and high mass define broadly similar @xmath0 color ",
    "g / s relations in their regime of overlap ( triangles and dots in fig .",
    "[ fg : both]c ) .",
    "it should be borne in mind that the generality of the photometric gas fraction technique as currently formulated relies on the fact that heavily dust - enshrouded star formation , as in luminous infrared galaxies , is rare in the low-@xmath35 universe @xcite . in dusty systems one might find high g / s linked to _ red _",
    "@xmath0 colors .",
    "also , the calibration given here could significantly underestimate actual gas - to - stellar mass ratios if stellar m / l ratios are much lower than assumed and/or molecular gas corrections are large ( a controversial topic ; see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the m / l ratios used here are roughly consistent with maximum disk assumptions for spiral galaxies @xcite . within the @xmath36 magnitude set , the best alternative to the @xmath0 color",
    "g / s relation is the @xmath33 color  g / s relation .",
    "its larger scatter may in part reflect the fact that @xmath22-band magnitude errors will move points along the @xmath0 color  g / s relation , but away from the @xmath33 color  g / s relation . however , the effect from cataloged errors is quite small ( arrows in figs .",
    "[ fg : both]b and  [ fg : both]c ) , so the greater @xmath33 scatter seems to be mostly physical .    fig .",

    "the well - known red and blue sequences ( referring to galaxy color , not color - coding ) are roughly separated by the dashed line ( an approximation to the separator of * ? ? ?",

    "the color - coding reveals a shift in gas fractions near a threshold mass of @xmath39 13 @xmath40 @xmath11 m@xmath4 .",
    "massive red - sequence galaxies are extremely gas - poor ( g / s@xmath38 as low as 1:100 , red / yellow color - coded points ) , whereas for red - sequence galaxies below @xmath41 , intermediate gas fractions ( g / s@xmath38 @xmath1 1:10 , green points ) are the norm .",
    "likewise , massive blue - sequence galaxies have intermediate gas fractions ( g / s@xmath38 @xmath1 1:10 , green points ) , but blue - sequence galaxies below @xmath41 are typically gas rich ( g / s@xmath38 @xmath1 1:1 , blue points ) .",
    "these results are shown in binned form in fig .",
    "[ fg : colormass]b , where the contours show the conditional probability distribution of @xmath33 on @xmath37 . in this plot ,",
    "a vertical slice through the contours at a given mass gives the one - dimensional probability distribution for @xmath33 colors at that mass .",
    "the conditional probability distribution is formed by weighting each galaxy by 1/v@xmath42 , where v@xmath42 is the maximum volume within which it could have been detected , then normalizing the counts in each color@xmath40mass bin by the total counts in each mass column .",
    "bins with fewer than four galaxies are not considered .",
    "this algorithm is most robustly applied to truly magnitude - limited samples , but the results shown here look qualitatively similar to those of @xcite for a magnitude - limited sdss sample .",
    "each galaxy is assigned the smallest of three v@xmath42 estimates , based on ( i ) the magnitude limit in @xmath43 , ( ii ) the magnitude limit in @xmath22 , and ( iii ) the distance limit imposed by the @xmath17 selection requirement .    the color - coded symbols in fig .",

    "[ fg : colormass]b indicates transitional values ( @xmath49 ) with both type symbols . some of the bluest low - mass galaxy bins show transitional types , which will not be examined here .",
    "otherwise , the blue sequence forms a broad , low @xmath44 strip , with a shift in gas richness at @xmath41 @xmath113 @xmath40 10@xmath50 m@xmath4 . at a similar mass",
    ", the red sequence shows a coordinated shift in gas richness and @xmath44 .",
    "intriguingly , the increased gas content of the red sequence below @xmath41 causes the red and blue sequences to fuse ( nearly ) in a plot of g / s@xmath38 vs.  @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "[ fg : colormass]c ) .",
    "the double - peaked , slightly s - shaped contours of the g / s@xmath38 vs.  @xmath5 distribution thus look qualitatively similar to the bimodal distribution of sfh vs.@xmath5 reported by @xcite .",

    "kauffmann et al .",
    "find a single - sequence bimodal structure in @xmath44 vs.  @xmath5 as well , perhaps because of the decreasing @xmath44 of the red sequence below @xmath41 .",
    "despite low @xmath44 values and high gas contents , the low - mass red sequence does fit into the general merger scenario for the origin of early - type galaxies , in a way that may illuminate the kauffmann et al .",
    "the low - mass red sequence maps closely to an abundant population of faint , moderately gas - rich s0 and s0/a galaxies observed in the nearby field galaxy survey , a survey designed to represent the natural distribution of galaxy types over a wide range of luminosities ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see fig .  3 of the latter ) .",
    "based on the frequency of gas - stellar counterrotation in this population and the scarcity of dwarf intermediate - type spiral galaxies , @xcite argue that @xmath5150% of low - luminosity s0 s may form via late - type dwarf mergers .",
    "such gas - rich mergers would naturally produce remnants with modest @xmath44 , explaining why low - luminosity early types are predominantly s0 rather than e galaxies .",
    "moreover , low - luminosity s0 s quite often have blue , starbursting centers , despite red outer disks @xcite , and such color gradients correlate with evidence of _ recent _ interactions ( in all morphological types , * ? ? ?",
    "the sfh measures adopted by @xcite , which are based on 3@xmath20-aperture spectroscopy , may emphasize the starbursting centers of this class of galaxies ( and conversely , the quiescent bulges of many high - mass late - type systems ) , reinforcing the single - sequence structure of the resulting sfh vs.  @xmath5 plots .",
    "a connection between star formation histories and gas fractions is in some sense obvious : gas must be consumed to form stars , so old red stellar populations will tend to be associated with diminished gas supplies .",
    "however , galaxies also accrete and expel gas , so this simple view misses much of the story .",
    "a complete picture must explain why gas fractions depend on mass , and in particular why there is such a close coincidence between the transition to gas richness ( atomic - gas - to - stellar mass ratio @xmath1 1:1 in the blue sequence ) and the shift to recent - burst dominated sfhs below @xmath1",
    "23 @xmath40 10@xmath50 m@xmath4 .",
    "critical transition masses are predicted by scenarios involving starburst - driven gas blow - away , inefficient star formation below a gravitational instability threshold , and/or cold - mode gas accretion @xcite .",
    "the abundance of gas in low - mass ( 10@xmath5210@xmath50 m@xmath4 ) galaxies seen in this paper is hard to explain if global gas blow - away is a dominant process in this mass regime",
    ". however , localized gas blowout or strong feedback could inhibit efficient widespread star formation in low - mass disk galaxies .",
    "such scenarios would not explicitly account for the gas in low - mass red - sequence galaxies , but formation via mergers of low - mass late - type systems , as discussed above , could allow low - mass red - sequence galaxies to acquire their modest gas excesses from gas - rich progenitors and thereby inherit the progenitors threshold mass for increased gas fractions . alternatively , it is possible that the transition in star formation modes at @xmath123 @xmath40 10@xmath50 m@xmath4 is not a cause , but an _ effect _ of changing gas fractions , as in cold - mode accretion scenarios .",
    "if so , low - mass galaxies may form stars reasonably efficiently and still appear gas rich .",
    "the excess gas in low - mass red - sequence galaxies could in this case represent post - merger cold - mode accretion , possibly as part of a process of disk regrowth .    in conclusion , this paper has demonstrated a shift in galaxy gas mass fractions at @xmath41 @xmath1 13 @xmath40 10@xmath50 m@xmath4 , likely related to the shift in sfhs observed near the same stellar mass by @xcite . the link may be causal in either direction , depending on the relative importance of supernova blowout , feedback , and cold - mode accretion processes in determining @xmath41 . to establish this result , a technique has been introduced to estimate photometric gas fractions based on the correlation between @xmath0 colors and atomic - gas - to - stellar mass ratios .",
    "this correlation is interesting in its own right ( see also * ? ? ?",
