    "since 1990s , background subtraction @xcite has been attracting great attention in the fields of image processing and computer vision .",
    "it aims at simultaneously separating video background and extracting the moving objects from a video stream , which provides important cues for numerous applications such as moving object detection  @xcite , object tracking in surveillance  @xcite , etc .",
    "most of the current video background subtraction techniques consist of four steps : video acquisition , encoding , decoding , and separating the moving objects from background  @xcite .",
    "for example , lamarre and clark  @xcite performed background subtraction on jpeg encoded video frames using a probabilistic model ; aggarwal et al .",
    "@xcite considered detecting moving objects on a mpeg - compressed video using dct coefficients of video frames .",
    "these conventional approaches commonly implement video acquisition , coding , and background subtraction in separate procedures .",
    "this conventional scheme requires to fully sample the video frames with large storage requirements , followed by well - designed video coding and background subtraction algorithms . recently , motivated by compressive",
    "sensing ( cs )  @xcite in signal processing , we focus on a newly - developed compressive imaging scheme @xcite for background subtraction by combining the video acquisition , coding and background subtraction into a single framework , which is called * _ background subtraction from compressive measurements ( bscm)_*. figure  [ framework ] shows an illustrative example .",
    "the video imaging system first captures compressive measurements from the scenes , and then transmits these measurements to the processing center for foreground / background reconstruction .",
    "compared to the conventional scheme , this new scheme need not fully sense all the video voxels , and thus heavily reduces the computational and storage costs and even the energy consumption of imaging sensors .        the task of the bscm is to reconstruct the original video with high fidelity and meanwhile accurately separate the moving objects from video background based on compressive measurements .",
    "the objective on this task is to maximize the reconstruction and separation accuracies using as few compressive measurements as possible .",
    "this is a heavily ill - posed inverse problem and it is necessary to discover the video prior knowledge to make this problem well - posed .",
    "there already exist some works  @xcite on the task of the bscm .",
    "the first seminal work was proposed by cevher et al .",
    "@xcite , in which the dynamic adaptation of background constraint and foreground reconstruction are gracefully handled .",
    "then , waters et al .",
    "@xcite observed that the frames in video background possess strong temporal correlation and the moving objects often occupy a small region in video foreground , and proposed a robust principal component analysis ( rpca ) model to cope with this task .",
    "guo et al .",
    "@xcite further proposed an online algorithm that utilizes the spatial continuity of the supports of moving objects in video foreground .",
    "jiang et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a reconstruction model in which the sparsity of video foreground in the transform domain is considered .",
    "we noted that , first , all of these approaches model and characterize different video priors in a _ matrix _ framework .",
    "second , although these algorithms have achieved good performance , more fine video priors of background and foreground have not been fully discovered .",
    "thus , more potential algorithms can be developed .        in this work ,",
    "we propose a tensor robust principal component analysis ( tenrpca ) approach for the task of the bscm . in this framework , we take the video frames or video patches as the high - order tensors , and extend the robust pca approach for matrix to the tensor - based video representation by fully investigating the domain - specific prior knowledge of surveillance videos for regularizing this inverse problem .",
    "compared to the matrix representation of surveillance video that represents each frame as a vector , this tensor - based video representation directly takes a video frame as a matrix slice in a tensor , which preserves the spatial and temporal structure of the surveillance video .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ mdlpri ] , we observed three types of priors for most surveillance videos with static backgrounds , i.e. , the nonlocal similarity of 3d patches in video background , the spatio - temporal continuity of video foreground , and the spatio - temporal correlation in video background .",
    "first , as shown in fig .",
    "[ mdlpri](a ) , a 3d patch in video background possesses many similar 3d patches over the video background , and each group of similar 3d patches has strong correlation .",
    "this property is termed as  * _ nonlocal self - similarity of video background_*. second , as shown in fig .",
    "[ mdlpri](b ) , the moving car in video foreground is spatially continuous in both its support regions and its intensity values in these regions .",
    "moreover , the moving car is also temporally continuous among succeeding frames .",
    "we term this prior as * _ spatio - temporal continuity of video foreground_*. third , the video backgrounds are spatially and temporally correlated . in fig .",
    "[ mdlpri](c ) , we show two curves ( red and blue ) of the singular values(c ) , we normalize the singular values of a matrix by enforcing their summation to be one . ] of two matrices , i.e. , one matrix with columns of vectorized video background frames and another matrix as one frame from the video background",
    ". the drastically decaying trend of the red curve indicates the strong temporal correlation among the video background frames and the slow decaying trend of the blue curve indicates the weak correlation in the spatial domain .",
    "let us define the accumulation energy ratio of top @xmath0 normalized singular values as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the @xmath3-th normalized singular value , i.e. , @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the @xmath3-th singular value .",
    "the arrow box for the red curve indicates that only top 3 singular values can attain the ratio 0.9030 while the arrow box for the blue curve indicates that top 84 singular values can attain the ratio 0.9770 .",
    "these quantitative values justify that the video background has strong correlation among its frames and each video background frame has weak spatial correlation .",
    "[ mdlpri](d ) further exhibits the weak correlations in other natural images .",
    "we term this observation as  * _ spatio - temporal correlation of video background_*.    based on the aforementioned video priors , we model the bscm in a tensor rpca framework ( tenrpca ) using tucker decomposition technique . with our model ,",
    "a video volume represented by a tensor is decomposed into a background layer based on its spatial - temporal correlation and foreground layer based on its spatial - temporal continuity .",
    "we design a tucker decomposition approach to model the spatio - temporal correlation in video background and a 3d total variation ( tv ) term to enforce the spatio - temporal continuity of video foreground .",
    "along this idea , we propose two tenrpca models by representing video background as a single tensor and a few patch - level tensors over groups of similar 3d patches , which are dubbed as holistic tensor rpca model ( h - tenrpca ) and patch - group - based tensor rpca model ( pg - tenrpca ) respectively .",
    "we design efficient algorithms using the alternating direction method of multipliers ( admm ) to optimize these proposed models .",
    "the experiments on synthetic and real videos demonstrate that our proposed two tenrpca models achieve higher reconstruction and background / foreground separation accuracies with fewer compressive measurements than the existing state - of - the - art approaches",
    ". moreover , the pg - tenrpca model generally works better than the h - tenrpca model which indicates the effectiveness of our modeling of the nonlocal self - similarity of video background .",
    "our _ contributions _ can be summarized as four folds : first , to the best of our knowledge , we are the first to model the bscm task in a tensor robust pca framework . compared to the matrix - based video representation , this tensor - based video representation well preserves the spatial - temporal structures of video , which enables us to fully characterize the priors of video spatial - temporal structures in our framework .",
    "second , we fully investigate the video priors for the bscm task .",
    "we design a 3d total variation ( tv ) term to encode the spatio - temporal continuity of video foreground , and a tucker decomposition approach to model the spatio - temporal correlation of video background .",
    "third , based on the observation of nonlocal self - similarity of video background , we design a patch - level background model using joint tucker decomposition over groups of similar 3d patches to model the strong correlations among similar 3d patches .",
    "this model significantly outperforms our holistic tenrpca model which represents the video background as a single tensor .",
    "finally , based on admm with the adaptive scheme , we design efficient algorithms to solve the proposed models , and achieve superior performance over the existing methods on various video data sets , especially when the sampling ratio is very low .",
    "the remaining of this paper is organized as follows . in section ii , the related works will be discussed . in section iii , the general framework of the bscm will be reviewed .",
    "our models and their motivations will be presented in section iv . in section",
    "v , efficient algorithms will be designed to solve the proposed models . in section",
    "vi , extensive experiments on various surveillance video data sets will be conducted to substantiate the superiority of the proposed models over the other existing ones .",
    "this paper will be concluded with some discussions on future work in section vii .",
    "various approaches for background subtraction using conventional imaging cameras have been developed since 1990s and obtained a wide range of applications in many fields .",
    "these approaches can be mainly categorized into the following five classes : the basic approach , the statistical approach , the fuzzy approach , the neural and neuro - fuzzy approach , and the subspace learning approach  @xcite .    among these traditional approaches ,",
    "the subspace learning approach has been attracting wide attentions in the field of machine learning and computer vision .",
    "one classical work on this task was proposed by oliver et al .",
    "@xcite , which uses an eigenspace ( pca ) idea to model the background .",
    "aiming at remedying the outlier and heavy noise issue , candes et al .",
    "@xcite proposed robust principal component analysis ( rpca ) to resist the gross sparse noise .",
    "this seminal work has triggered a tremendous interest in dealing with background subtraction using different formulations of rpca .",
    "for example , the markov random field ( mrf ) regularized rpca technique was proposed in zhou et al .",
    "@xcite , a novel block sparse rpca formulation was proposed in  @xcite , total variation regularized rpca and matrix factorization methods were respectively proposed in cao et al .",
    "@xcite and guo et al .",
    "@xcite , and the probabilistic versions of rpca were proposed in ding et al .",
    "@xcite and babacan et al .",
    "@xcite , respectively . in the recent work ,",
    "zhao et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a new probabilistic variant by extracting multi - layer structures with certain physical meanings using the mixture of gaussians ( mog ) .    to meet the real - time requirements in practical applications ,",
    "various online subspace learning approaches were developed .",
    "rymel et al .",
    "@xcite and li et al .",
    "@xcite respectively proposed an incremental pca method to handle the newly coming video streams . by constraining the subspace on grassmannian manifold , balzano et al .",
    "@xcite proposed two efficient approaches named grouse and grasta respectively , to deal with online subspace identification and tracking ( sit ) task .",
    "additionally , it was reported that the proposed grouse and grasta can effectively achieve the real - time background subtraction through sampling the voxels of video sequence .",
    "xu et al .",
    "@xcite further proposed an updated version of grasta by modeling the contiguous structure of supports of video foreground using group sparsity .",
    "chi et al .",
    "@xcite developed an online parallel sit algorithm using recursive least squares technique for real - time background subtraction .      recently , multiple studies have been carried out for the background subtraction problem from the perspective of compressive imaging , in which it is required to simultaneously perform background subtraction and video reconstruction . the first seminal work was considered by cevher et al .",
    "@xcite , in which the dynamic adaptation of background constraint and foreground reconstruction are gracefully handled .",
    "recently , based on the theoretical results of @xmath6-@xmath6 minimization  @xcite , mota et al .",
    "@xcite proposed an efficient adaptive - rate algorithm to deal with the bscm task .",
    "additionally , a series of work have been proposed based on the matrix rpca technique",
    ". waters et al .  @xcite integrated the matrix rpca methodology into the framework of the bscm and then developed a greedy algorithm called sparcs to solve the resulting model .",
    "guo et al .",
    "@xcite developed an online rpca algorithm that models the spatial continuity prior of moving objects in the foreground .",
    "jiang et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a new rpca model in which the sparsity of video foreground in the transform domain is considered based on certain practical requirements .",
    "the matrix rpca approaches for the bscm commonly model the video as a matrix with columns of vectorized video frames .",
    "although the matrix rpca methodology has been an increasingly useful technique , it fails in fully exploiting the prior knowledge on the intrinsic structures of video after vectorizing the video frames .",
    "our proposed tensor rpca approach considers more extensive spatio - temporal prior knowledge of video background and foreground using tensor representation of video .",
    "such full utilization of prior information makes our approach capable of achieving a better video reconstruction quality and simultaneously detecting the moving objects in foreground from a limited number of compressive measurements , as will be shown in section vi .",
    "we also noted that the tensor compressive sensing models were recently proposed in  @xcite .",
    "but they are significantly different from our models , because these model are designed for the image / video compressive sensing task instead of the more complex bscm task considered in this paper .",
    "in this section , we will present the general framework for the bscm task .",
    "we will mainly focus on the mathematical modeling and algorithm design in the pipeline of bscm , i.e. , reconstruct video foreground and background from compressive measurements . in the followings , we will introduce the basic components of the bscm task , including the representation of video volume , compressive operator , and video reconstruction and separation .",
    "video frames within a short period are collected as a video volume .",
    "if the video frame has a single channel , then the video volume can be represented as a 3-order tensor @xmath7,@xmath8 , where each matrix @xmath9 represents @xmath3-th frame . @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the height and width of a frame and @xmath12 denotes the number of frames .",
    "this tensor has 3 modes including height , width and time .",
    "we assume that the video volume to be reconstructed can be separated into a static component ( video background ) @xmath13 , and a dynamic component ( video foreground ) @xmath14 , i.e. , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 . in the following ,",
    "we denote the vectorization of a video volume @xmath18 by @xmath19 $ ] , and the vectorization of video background and foreground by @xmath20 $ ] and @xmath21 $ ] , respectively .",
    "compressive operator can be considered as the effective encoding of video volume .",
    "currently , how to design a high quality compressive operator is a crucial research topic in the cs community ; see  @xcite . for video data ,",
    "the compressive measurements @xmath22 can be obtained by @xmath23 where @xmath22 is a vector of length @xmath24 , and @xmath25 indicates a given compressive operator .    in this work , the randomly permuted walsh - hadamard operator  @xcite and the randomly permuted noiselet operator  @xcite",
    "will be employed as compressive operators because of their low computational cost and easy hardware implementation .",
    "compressive operator can be instantiated as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is a random permutation matrix , @xmath28 is the walsh - hadamard transform or the noiselet transform , and @xmath29 is a randomly down sampling operator . as stated in @xcite , compressive operator often encodes video volume @xmath18 through two ways .",
    "one is the holistic manner , i.e. , @xmath22= @xmath30 , which directly collects full 3d measurements of a video sequence .",
    "the other is the frame - wise manner , i.e. , @xmath31= @xmath32 , which collects 2d _ frame - by - frame _ measurements @xmath33 and then concatenates all @xmath33 into a long vector @xmath34 . in most experiments of this work , compressive operator @xmath25 will be set as the frame - by - frame one .      as we know",
    ", recovering @xmath18 and simultaneously separating @xmath13 with @xmath14 from the compressive measurements @xmath34 is a heavily ill - posed inverse problem .",
    "hence , it is necessary to regularize this inverse problem by discovering the underlying video prior knowledge .",
    "mathematically , the regularized inverse problem can be generally formulated as @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the prior knowledge modeling terms on video background and foreground , respectively ; @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the vectorizations of  @xmath18 ,  @xmath13 and  @xmath14 , respectively ; and @xmath41 is a trade - off parameter between the terms @xmath36 and @xmath37 .    in the following section",
    ", we will fully discover the priors for surveillance videos and characterize these priors using tensor algebra , which naturally instantiates the general model in eq .   into the practical models .",
    "in this section , we will present our proposed tensor robust principal component ( pca ) models for the bscm task .",
    "we first review the basics in multi - linear algebra .",
    "then , we present our basic model for video decomposition , and further propose detailed foreground model and background model by considering the spatio - temporal continuity of video foreground and spatial - temporal correlations of video background . in the background modeling , we propose two models that represent the video background as a single tensor and several patch - level tensors over groups of similar 3d patches respectively .",
    "we utilize tensor tucker decomposition to model the video background in the aforementioned holistic and patch - based representations , and produce two tensor rpca models ( named h - tenrpca and pg - tenrpca ) , respectively .",
    ".notations [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ realoperator ]",
    "in this paper , we proposed a novel tensor - based robust pca approach for background subtraction from compressive measurements , in which tucker decomposition is utilized to model the spatio - temporal correlation of the background in video streams , and 3d - tv is employed to characterize the smoothness of video foreground . furthermore , we proposed an improved tensor rpca model that models the video background as several tensors over groups of similar video patches , taking advantages of the strong correlations of these patches in each patch group .",
    "extensive experiments on synthetic and real - world data sets are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of proposed approaches over the existing state - of - the - art approaches .    in the future work ,",
    "we are interested in the following research directions .",
    "first , model the layers of the foregrounds using mixture of gaussian to enhance its encoding capability for complex configured foreground .",
    "second , develop better model for the complex background , such as dynamic background with illumination change , smog or snow ,  and so on .",
    "third , incorporate the motion of cameras into our proposed models . finally , develop online version of our approach to make it more effective , thus facilitating the further use for more practical scenarios .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    this optimization problem can be approximately solved by the alternating direction method ( adm ) .",
    "firstly , fixing the orthogonal factors @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , we have @xmath46 .",
    "hence , it follows that @xmath47 then , using the solution of @xmath48 we further derive that @xmath49 the factor matrix @xmath42 can be estimated by maximizing @xmath50 with respect to @xmath42 .",

    "<S> background subtraction has been a fundamental and widely studied task in video analysis , with a wide range of applications in video surveillance , teleconferencing and 3d modeling . </S>",
    "<S> recently , motivated by compressive imaging , background subtraction from compressive measurements ( bscm ) is becoming an active research task in video surveillance . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a novel tensor - based robust pca ( tenrpca ) approach for bscm by decomposing video frames into backgrounds with spatial - temporal correlations and foregrounds with spatio - temporal continuity in a tensor framework . in this approach , </S>",
    "<S> we use 3d total variation ( tv ) to enhance the spatio - temporal continuity of foregrounds , and tucker decomposition to model the spatio - temporal correlations of video background . based on this idea , </S>",
    "<S> we design a basic tensor rpca model over the video frames , dubbed as the holistic tenrpca model ( h - tenrpca ) . to characterize the correlations among the groups of similar 3d patches of video background , we further design a patch - group - based tensor rpca model ( pg - tenrpca ) by joint tensor tucker decompositions of 3d patch groups for modeling the video background . </S>",
    "<S> efficient algorithms using alternating direction method of multipliers ( admm ) are developed to solve the proposed models . </S>",
