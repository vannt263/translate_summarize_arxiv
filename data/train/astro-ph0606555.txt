    "nowadays an overwhelming , direct and indirect , observational evidence supports the idea that the universe is currently undergoing a phase of accelerated expansion .",
    "the most recent and precise confirmation of this rather unexpected feature ( see , however @xcite ) was provided by the 3rd year data of the wmap mission @xcite .",
    "likewise , data from high  redshift supernovae type ia @xcite , the cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite , the large scale structure @xcite , the integrated sachs ",
    "wolfe effect @xcite , and weak lensing @xcite , endorse it to the point that the discussion has now shifted to when the acceleration began and which might be the agent behind it .",
    "for recent reviews see @xcite .",
    "according to our understanding on the basis of einstein s gravity , more than @xmath0% of the cosmic substratum , dubbed dark energy , must be endowed with a high negative pressure .",
    "less than @xmath1% is found to be pressureless matter .",
    "most of the latter is in the form of cold dark matter ; only about @xmath2% corresponds to  normal \" baryonic matter .",
    "currently , we neither know what the dark matter is made of nor do we understand the nature of dark energy .    lacking a fundamental theory ,",
    "most investigations in the field are phenomenological and rely on the assumption that these two unknown substances evolve independently , i.e. , their energies are assumed to obey separate conservation laws .",
    "in particular , this implies that the dark matter energy density varies as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the scale factor of the robertson - walker metric .",
    "the behavior of the density of the dark energy is then entirely governed by its equation of state , the determination of which is a major subject of current observational cosmology .",
    "one should realize , however , that any coupling in the dark sector will change this situation .",
    "a coupling will modify the evolution history of the universe .",
    "as one of the consequences , the energy density of the ( interacting ) dark matter will no longer evolve as @xmath3 . ignoring a potentially existing interaction between dark matter and dark energy from the start ,",
    "may result in a misled interpretation of the data concerning the dark energy equation of state .",
    "_ @xcite and amendola _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have shown that a measured phantom equation of state may be mimicked by an interaction , while the bare equation of state may well be of a non - phantom type .",
    "further , models showing interaction fare well when contrasted with data from the cosmic microwave background @xcite and matter distribution at large scales @xcite .",
    "it can therefore be argued that the possibility of dark energy to be in interaction with dark matter must be taken seriously .    on the other hand ,",
    "there exist limits for the strength of this interaction for various configurations @xcite .",
    "it is characteristic for these approaches that they admit a non - interacting limit .",
    "if the interaction is switched off , they continue to represent models of a mixture of dark matter and dark energy .",
    "the best known examples are models with a decaying cosmological  constant \" : if the decay is switched off , they reduce to the @xmath5cdm model .",
    "an interaction here leads to ( possibly important ) corrections of the non - interacting configuration .",
    "e.g. , for a given ( not necessarily constant ) negative equation of state parameter of the dark energy , the interaction manifests itself in third order in the redshift in the luminosity distance of supernovae type ia @xcite .",
    "it does not , however , ( directly ) influence the leading orders .",
    "the qualitatively new aspect of the present approach is the circumstance that an interaction is crucial already in leading order . in this context",
    "the accelerated expansion itself is a consequence of the interaction .",
    "the coupling does not just lead to higher order corrections of a non - interacting reference model which by itself provides an accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "the non - interacting limit of the present approach reproduces an einstein - de sitter universe , i.e. , there is no accelerated expansion if the interaction is switched off .",
    "this non - interacting limit is supposed to characterize our universe at high redshifts .",
    "the data also suggest that the present universe is nearly spatially flat @xcite , @xcite .",
    "many studies neglect the spatial curvature term and focus solely on the spatially flat case , thereby taking for granted that the spatial curvature term necessarily leads to trifling corrections .",
    "several of the not so many works that retain that term , for the sake of generality , even seem to justify that it is of minor importance . on the other hand , thanks to the increasing observational precision also higher order corrections may become within reach in the not too distant future .",
    "the authors of @xcite have demonstrated that the spatial curvature enters the luminosity distance of snia supernovae in third order in redshift ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is also known that there are degeneracies between the curvature and the dark energy equation of state in the corresponding parameter space @xcite .",
    "the possible relevance of spatial curvature for the lowest multipoles in the cosmic microwave background radiation was discussed in @xcite .",
    "these examples indicate that apart from general theoretical grounds , the observational situation will require the inclusion of spatial curvature , even if its contribution is small , at some level of precision .",
    "further , as demonstrated by ichikawa _",
    "@xcite , depending on the parametrization of the equation of state parameter the present value of the spatial curvature can be as large as @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , the additional dynamics provided by the curvature , should certainly not be dismissed too quickly since it contains information which is needed to further restrict the cosmological parameter space . in this connection ,",
    "clarkson _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have shown that by excluding the spatial curvature when interpreting the empirical data one can incur in gross mistakes when reconstructing the equation of state of dark energy .",
    "we mention that an effective spatial curvature term also appears as the result of an averaging procedure within the  macrosopic gravity \" approach @xcite ( for a further discussion of the effects of averaging on cosmological observations see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we consider pressureless dark matter in interaction with an unknown component which is supposed to describe dark energy .",
    "we neither specify the dark energy equation of state nor the interaction rate from the beginning .",
    "these two ( generally time dependent ) parameters will influence the ratio of the energy densities of dark matter and dark energy .",
    "the behavior of this ratio is crucial for the  conventional \" form of the  coincidence problem \" , namely :  why are the matter and dark energy densities of precisely the same order today \" . in principle ,",
    "matter and dark energy redshift at different rates .",
    "we show , that there exists a preferred class of dark energy models for which the dynamics of the energy density ratio is entirely determined by the spatial curvature . for vanishing curvature",
    "the energy density ratio remains constant .",
    "these models are singled out by a dependence @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the dark energy density and @xmath9 is the hubble parameter .",
    "exactly this dependence is characteristic for a certain type of dark energy models , inspired by the holographic principle @xcite .",
    "holographic dark energy models must specify an infrared cutoff length scale @xcite .",
    "the choice of this scale is presently a matter of debate .",
    "the most obvious choice , the hubble length , seemed to be incompatible with an accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite ( see , however , @xcite ) .",
    "this is why , starting with the work of li @xcite , many researchers have adopted the future event horizon as the cutoff scale as this choice allows for a sufficiently negative equation of state parameter and hence an accelerated expansion -see , e.g. @xcite .    in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", we showed that a cutoff set by the hubble length may well be compatible with an accelerated expansion provided that the dark energy and dark matter do not evolve separately but interact , also non  gravitationally , with each other . in this setting , a negative equation of state parameter that gives rise to accelerated expansion arises as a direct consequence of the interaction . here",
    "we put this feature in a broader context and demonstrate that a constant or slowly varying ( as the consequence of a non - vanishing spatial curvature ) energy density ratio is compatible with a transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion under the condition of a growing interaction parameter .",
    "we show that in holographic dark energy models with a hubble length cutoff a transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion is realized as a pure interaction effect . at high redshifts and for negligible interaction",
    "the dark energy equation of state approaches the equation of state for matter , such that a preceding matter era is naturally recovered . in this context",
    "the coincidence problem can be rephrased as follows :  why is the interaction rate between dark matter and dark energy of the order of the hubble rate precisely at the present epoch ? \" this reformulation allows us to address the coincidence problem as part of the interaction dynamics in the dark sector .",
    "different interaction rates will imply a different perturbation dynamics .",
    "we shall demonstrate that non - adiabatic features appear as a characteristic signature for a large class of interacting models .",
    "these effects may be used to discriminate between different models of the cosmic medium which share the same background dynamics .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "section [ general ] provides the general formalism for an interacting two - component fluid , where one of the fluids is pressureless .",
    "then it focuses on the case for which the ratio of the energy densities of both fluids is constant or slowly varying .",
    "this will single out models for which the energy density of the second component is proportional to the square of the hubble parameter . a realization of this dependence",
    "is provided by certain holographic dark energy models .",
    "the basic properties of these models are recalled in section [ holography ] .",
    "section [ interaction ] discusses in detail matter in interaction with holographic dark energy .",
    "it provides the conditions under which an interaction driven transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion is feasible .",
    "it also comments on the possibility of a weak time dependence of the saturation parameter of the holographic bound , which is usually assumed constant .",
    "section [ model ] introduces a simple interacting model and compares it with the @xmath5cdm model .",
    "the perturbation dynamics for a fluctuating interaction rate is discussed in [ perturbations ] with special emphasis on non - adiabatic aspects on large perturbation scales .",
    "finally , section [ discussion ] summarizes our findings .",
    "the field equations for a spatially homogeneous and isotropic universe are the friedmann equation @xmath10 and @xmath11 a combination of both equations yields @xmath12 a relation that will be useful later on .",
    "the deceleration parameter , @xmath13 , can be written as @xmath14 + the total energy density @xmath15 is supposed to split into @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the energy density of pressureless dark matter . under this assumption",
    "the total pressure equals the dark energy pressure , @xmath18 .",
    "we further assume that both components do not conserve separately but interact with each other in such a manner that the balance equations take the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the equation of state parameter of the dark energy , and the function @xmath21 measures the strength of the interaction .",
    "models featuring an interaction matter ",
    "dark energy were introduced by wetterich @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and first used alongside the holographic dark energy by horvat @xcite .",
    "nowadays there is a growing body of literature on the subject -see , e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "although the assumption of a coupling between both components implies the introduction of an additional phenomenological function @xmath22 , a description that admits interactions is certainly more general than otherwise .",
    "further , there is no known symmetry that would suppress such interaction and arguments in favor of interacting models have been put forward recently @xcite .",
    "the quantity of interest for analyzing the coincidence problem is the ratio @xmath23 , which , upon using eqs .",

    "a survey of the , by now , rather ample body of literature on dark energy candidates reveals that models of this type have indeed been introduced previously , namely , in the context of ideas which are rooted in the holographic principle . in the following section we briefly recall , how a dependence @xmath7 emerges in these holographic dark energy models .",
    "the basic ideas of the holographic principle were introduced by ",
    "t hooft @xcite and susskind @xcite .",
    "the development of interest for our purpose was put forward by cohen _",
    "@xcite , followed by hsu @xcite and li @xcite , who considered specific holographic dark energy models .",
    "the essential point in establishing the holographic idea is the way of counting the degrees of freedom of a physical system .",
    "consider a three - dimensional lattice of spin - like degrees of freedom and assume that the distance between every two neighboring sites is some small length @xmath39 which is of the order of the planck length , @xmath40 .",
    "each spin can be in one of two states . in a region of volume @xmath41",
    "the number of quantum states @xmath42 will be @xmath43 , with @xmath44 the number of sites in the volume , whence the entropy , given by the logarithm of @xmath42 , will be @xmath45 . identifying ( in planck units ) @xmath46 with the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath5 ( the corresponding energy is @xmath47 ) , the maximum entropy varies as @xmath48 , i.e. , proportional to the volume of the system . based on considerations on black hole thermodynamics ( bear in mind that the bekenstein  hawking entropy is @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the area of the black hole horizon ) , bekenstein @xcite argued that the maximum entropy for a box of volume @xmath41 should be proportional to its surface rather than to its volume . in keeping with this , ",
    "t hooft conjectured that all phenomena within a volume @xmath41 should be described by a set of degrees of freedom located at the surface which bounds this volume with approximately one binary degree of freedom per planck s area .    inspired by these ideas , cohen _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite demonstrated that an effective field theory that saturates the inequality ( the bekenstein bound ) @xmath51 necessarily includes states for which the schwarzschild radius @xmath52 is larger than the box size , i.e. , @xmath53 .",
    "namely , for sufficiently high temperatures ( in planck units @xmath54 but",
    "@xmath55 ) the thermal energy of the system is @xmath56 while its entropy is @xmath57 . when eq .",
    "( [ saturates ] ) is saturated ( by setting @xmath58 in there ) it follows that @xmath59 .",
    "now , the schwarzschild radius @xmath52 is related to the energy by @xmath60 ( recall that an object with schwarzschild radius @xmath52 corresponds to a ( newtonian ) mass @xmath61 ) .",
    "consequently , @xmath62 , i.e. , the schwarzschild radius is indeed larger than the system size .    a stronger constraint which excludes states",
    "for which the schwarzschild radius exceeds the size @xmath63 is @xmath64 the expression on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ deineq ] ) corresponds to the energy of a black hole of size @xmath63 .",
    "so , this constraint ensures that the energy @xmath65 in a box of the size @xmath63 does not exceed the energy of a black hole of the same size @xcite .",
    "while the bekenstein bound ( [ saturates ] ) implies a scaling @xmath66 , the inequality ( [ deineq ] ) corresponds to a behavior @xmath67 .",
    "furthermore , since saturation of ( [ deineq ] ) means @xmath68 , one finds that @xmath69 .    by saturating the inequality ( [ deineq ] ) and identifying @xmath70 with the holographic energy density",
    "@xmath8 it follows @xcite @xmath71 where the factor @xmath72 was introduced for convenience and @xmath73 is a dimensionless quantity which is usually assumed constant .",
    "it is obvious , that for a choice @xmath74 , i.e. , for a cutoff set by the hubble radius , the energy density ( [ rhox ] ) is characterized by exactly that dependence @xmath75 which was singled out by eqs .",
    "( [ rdotalt2 ] ) and ( [ rdotalt3 ] ) . in the following we shall identify ( [ rhox ] ) with the energy density @xmath8 appearing in eq .",

    "possible changes of @xmath33 due to a non - vanishing spatial curvature term are necessarily small . at first glance ,",
    "models with a constant ( or almost constant ) energy density ratio seem unable to account for a transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion . and",
    "indeed , holographic dark energy models with the hubble scale as cutoff length were considered to be ruled out since their equation of state parameter does not seem to allow negative values which are required for an accelerated expansion @xcite . however , as shown previously , the presence of an interaction between dark energy and dark matter may change this situation @xcite .",
    "this becomes obvious if eq .",

    "the result is + @xmath79 + assuming @xmath80 small , the interaction rate @xmath81 essentially determines the equation of state parameter as soon as the dimensionless ratio @xmath82 , which here and in the following is the relevant interaction parameter , becomes of order one . for negligible interaction , @xmath83 ,",
    "one has @xmath84 .",
    "the main point of interest now is the behavior of the deceleration parameter , i.e. , whether this kind of models admits a transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion .",
    "the condition for accelerated expansion ( @xmath85 ) @xmath86 readily follows from the above equations .",
    "introduction of the expression ( [ w ] ) for @xmath78 into the latter leads to @xmath87 where we have used friedmann s equation ( [ sumomega ] ) . on the other hand ,",

    "( [ w ] ) we find that this condition amounts to @xmath89 therefore , the consistency condition simply reads , @xmath90 the inequality (",

    "the latter implies that @xmath78 must be close to zero deep in the matter dominated era ( cf .",

    "an initial condition @xmath92 is equivalent to an initially negligible interaction .",

    "both inequalities are consistent with condition ( [ omegax > ] ) .",
    "this supports our suggestion that , depending on the interaction rate , a transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion is indeed feasible .    starting from eq .",

    "the spatially curved cases generate an interesting additional dynamics .",
    "the transition condition @xmath99 ( cf .",
    "( [ acch ] ) ) coincides with the condition for @xmath100 for @xmath101 in ( [ rdothol1 ] ) .",

    "we mention again , that any change of @xmath33 arises solely as a curvature effect .",
    "a different way to understand the dynamics of the ratio @xmath33 , which also may be seen as a consistency check , is to start from eq .",

    "the difference of these two ratios is directly proportional to the ( negative ) deceleration parameter .",
    "accelerated expansion requires @xmath118 , decelerated expansion demands @xmath119 .",
    "it is obvious , that even a constant or a slowly varying ratio @xmath33 may be compatible with a sign change of @xmath115 provided @xmath82 evolves accordingly .",
    "even with a constant @xmath33 a present accelerated expansion is compatible with an earlier matter dominated period with decelerated expansion .",

    "is not really an important parameter since it describes the ratio of two components with the same equation of state .",
    "it was this property that apparently ruled out a ( non - interacting ) holographic dark energy model with an infrared cutoff set by the hubble scale @xcite . here , this unwanted ( in the non - interacting model ) feature is advantageous since , thanks to it , a matter dominated phase during which structure formation can occur is naturally recovered .",
    "it is only because of the gradually increased interaction that the equations of state begin to differ from each other .",
    "then @xmath33 becomes important . at the first glance the circumstance that @xmath33 is constant or only slowly varying seems to imply , that the coincidence problem gets significantly alleviated .",
    "but in fact , it has been shifted from the problem to explain a constant ( or slowly varying ) ratio @xmath33 towards the problem to explain an interaction rate which has to be of the order of the hubble rate just at the present time .",
    "we argue that an alternative , dynamical formulation of the coincidence problem maybe useful , in particular , if a specific interacting model of the type presented here will lead to potentially observable differences from , say the @xmath5cdm model or generalized chaplygin gas models ( see below ) .",
    "one might argue against a constant -or nearly constant- ratio @xmath33 by saying that , as is well known , at the time of primeval nucleosynthesis the dark energy should not contribute more than @xmath2 per cent to the total energy density if the standard big bang scenario for the build up of light elements is to hold @xcite",
