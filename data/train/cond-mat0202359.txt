    ", non - magnetic impurities like zn and li can induce a local moment on the neighboring lattice sites at intermediate energies  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", zn is known to act as pair breaker and strong scatterer , e.g. in low - temperature transport measurements , and at present it is not clear whether this behavior arises from bare potential scattering only , or if other effects like kondo physics play a role .",
    "local impurity moments  arising either from magnetic impurities or induced by non - magnetic defects  interact with the low - energy bulk excitations . for cuprates at temperatures @xmath1 below the superconducting @xmath2 ,",
    "these are the fermionic quasiparticles of the @xmath0-wave superconductor and collective bosonic spin fluctuations .",
    "the coupling to the spin fluctuations mainly plays a role at intermediate energy scales of the order of the spin gap ( an estimate is given by the position of the so - called resonance mode at 40 mev )  their effect on the impurity dynamics has been discussed recently in ref .  .",
    "for smaller energies , the dynamics of the impurity moments is governed by the interaction with the fermionic bogoliubov quasiparticles .",
    "importantly , their single - particle density of states ( dos ) vanishes at the fermi energy , therefore the physics is quite distinct from the usual kondo effect in metals  @xcite .",
    "extensive studies of the pseudogap kondo model  @xcite , where the host dos follows a power - law near the fermi level , @xmath3 ( @xmath4 for @xmath0-wave superconductors ) , have shown the existence of a boundary quantum phase transition between a free moment and a screened moment as the kondo coupling is increased . applied to the cuprates ,",
    "we have argued  @xcite that this can lead to a strongly doping - dependent kondo temperature , caused by the doping dependence of the size of the @xmath0-wave gap .",
    "these theoretical findings are consistent with nmr experiments @xcite measuring the local susceptibility near a non - magnetic impurity .",
    "this susceptibility has been found to show curie - weiss - like behavior , with a weiss temperature being finite at optimal doping but apparently vanishing for underdoped samples  this implies the existence of unscreened moments in the underdoped regime down to temperatures of order 1 k.    interesting impurity signatures have also been observed in recent scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) experiments of the high temperature superconductor @xmath5 ( bscco ) @xcite .",
    "studies in the vicinity of zn impurities on the cu sites  @xcite have found a large peak in the differential conductance at small energies of 12 mev near the zn site , with a characteristic spatial variation of the signal .",
    "this peak could represent a quasi - bound state in a potential scattering model@xcite , but such a state appears at low energies only for a range of large potential values depending upon microscopic details @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been proposed @xcite that some of the properties of the zn resonance can be explained by the kondo spin dynamics of the magnetic moment induced by zn .",
    "the screening of this moment by the bogoliubov quasiparticles provides a natural low - energy scale ( the kondo temperature ) explaining the energetic location of the peak seen in stm  in this case the potential scattering model might still apply as an _ effective _ model at low temperatures .",
    "however , not all features of the zn resonance can be understood within the existing models , and important ingredients in the theoretical description , e.g. , the actual tunneling path of the electrons from the tip to the cuo@xmath6 plane @xcite , are not well known , calling for further experimental clarification . in this paper we study the screening of an impurity moment embedded in a @xmath0-wave superconductor in a zeeman magnetic field ; we do neglect the changes in the quasiparticle spectrum due to the superflow induced by vortices which is appropriate for in - plane magnetic fields ( parallel to the copper oxide layers ) and for impurities located in between two vortices .",
    "in particular , we calculate the field - dependent impurity spectral density ",
    "based on these results , we propose that stm tunneling experiments in high magnetic fields will be able to distinguish between the possible sources of the observed impurity stm signal , and thus contribute to clarify the nature of impurity scattering in cuprate superconductors .",
    "we begin by describing our model hamiltonian , @xmath7 , for a superconductor with a single impurity .",

    "the influence of a zeeman magnetic field on a @xmath0-wave bcs superconductor has been studied in ref .  .",
    "for low temperatures and small fields , @xmath21 , the field - induced change in the gap function @xmath22 can be neglected .",
    "thus the main effect of the zeeman field is to split the quasiparticle spectrum by @xmath23 , which leads to a finite dos at the fermi level .",
    "we will not consider the coupling of the external field to the orbital motion of the electrons  the primary effect of the field - induced superflow would be an additional shift in the quasiparticle spectrum .",
    "neglecting this doppler effect is approximately justified for fields applied parallel to the cuo@xmath6 planes of the system : due to the layered crystal structure and strong anisotropy , the orbital effect of the magnetic field is much weaker for in - plane fields , and vortex effects are likely to be small  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we expect our approximation to apply also for fields in @xmath24-axis direction , i.e. , perpendicular to the planes , for impurities located in between two vortices where the superflow tends to cancel and hence the doppler shift is small .",
    "= 3.5 in    the impurity , located at @xmath25 , is described by an effective model consisting of a scattering potential @xmath26 and a kondo term for the spin-1/2 impurity spin @xmath27 : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the conduction band spin operator at site @xmath30 . as discussed in refs .",
    "we will consider two cases : ( i ) a local magnetic moment where @xmath31 , and ( ii ) a spatially extended magnetic moment ( modelling zn ) where @xmath32 is a set of sites in the neighborhood of @xmath33 ; guided by nmr experiments  @xcite we take @xmath32 to be the four neighbors of @xmath33 , i.e. , @xmath34 for @xmath35 and @xmath36 otherwise .",
    "note that this four - site model describes an induced moment fluctuating as a _",
    "entity , in agreement with spin relaxation experiments @xcite .",
    "the kondo term in the four - site case defines a multichannel kondo problem ; however , the low - energy physics in the present situation is dominated by a single channel given by the @xmath0-wave - like linear combination of the conduction electrons on the four neighboring sites  @xcite .    the potential scattering term in ( [ himp ] ) can be accounted for exactly : @xmath37^{-1 } g^0 ( { \\bf r}_0-{\\bf r}^{\\prime},\\omega ) .",

    "in the following , we describe our numerical results for the above kondo model in an external field , obtained with wilson s numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) technique  @xcite .",
    "the zero - field pseudogap kondo problem in the presence of particle - hole asymmetry is known to show a boundary quantum phase transition between an asymmetric strong - coupling ( asc ) phase with a screened impurity moment and a local moment ( lm ) phase with curie behavior of the impurity susceptibility  @xcite .",
    "= 3.5 in    we start by considering the case of a local field only , @xmath49 but @xmath42 , such that the host dos is unaffected by the field . from the analysis of the fixed points of the nrg calculation we have found that even in a finite local field there is still a phase transition upon varying the kondo coupling . the @xmath50 phase diagram deduced from nrg is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ figphd1]a  there is a line of finite - field transitions ending in the zero - field transition point known from earlier work @xcite which can be viewed as a multicritical point .",
    "the three stable phases are easily understood : the asc phase at @xmath51 extends to finite field ( with weak spin polarization for @xmath49 ) , whereas the lm phase at @xmath52 with a free impurity spin exists at zero field only . applying a field at @xmath52 immediately leads to a phase with strong polarization of the impurity spin",
    ", therefore we term this phase pol .",
    "all transitions found are continuous phase transitions , characterized by a small energy scale @xmath53 , which vanishes at the transition , and defines the crossover energy above which quantum - critical behavior is observed . in the asc phase at zero field",
    ", @xmath54 can be identified with the kondo temperature  @xcite , i.e. , with the binding energy of the kondo singlet . the transition from asc to pol",
    "is characterized by breaking this singlet by the external field  consequently the critical field @xmath55 close to the multicritical point is given by @xmath54 times a prefactor depending on the dos exponent @xmath56 .",
    "note that this novel _ field - induced kondo transition _ is unique to the pseudogap model studied here  in the metallic host case ( @xmath57 ) the application of a field leads only to a gradual suppression of the kondo effect  @xcite .    from the above discussion",
    "we expect that a _ uniform _ zeeman field @xmath58 removes the critical point , because a finite @xmath18 leads to a finite dos at the fermi level .",
    "our numerical calculations show that this is indeed the case  for any finite @xmath59 the asymptotic zero - temperature behavior is that of a conventional ( i.e. metallic - host ) kondo - screened spin in a magnetic field . however , the characteristic energy scale below which this behavior occurs is tiny , as it is exponentially small in the field - induced dos at the fermi level .",
    "( the same applies to effects arising from the small low - energy dos induced by a finite concentration of impurities , i.e. , the so - called impurity band  @xcite . ) therefore , at practically accessible temperatures the finite - field behavior is determined by the physics of the pol and asc phases described above , and both regimes are now separated by a sharp crossover , fig .",
    "[ figphd1]b .",
    "this crossover field turns out to be somewhat smaller than the critical _ local _ field in fig .",
    "[ figphd1]a ; their ratio depends on the field - induced dos at the fermi level ( i.e. the dos exponent @xmath56 ) .    the properties of the phases are reflected in the field - induced impurity magnetization , fig .",

    "[ figmag1]b , the singularity in @xmath60 is replaced by a relatively sharp crossover .",
    "turning to the dynamic properties of the kondo impurity , we now discuss the conduction electron @xmath1 matrix , @xmath62 , which is the important input quantity for the calculation of the local dos measured by stm .",

    "the crossover from quantum - critical @xmath68 behavior at high energies to @xmath69 behavior at low energies leads to a characteristic peak in the spectral density on one ( ! ) side of the fermi level at an energy @xmath54 , which can be viewed as kondo peak ( note that the problem at hand is intrinsically particle - hole asymmetric ) .    for finite field ,",
    "the spin degeneracy is lifted : applying a small field to the system with @xmath70 splits the kondo peak , in a manner roughly similar to the field - induced peak splitting in the conventional ( metallic ) kondo effect  @xcite .",

    "the simple peak - splitting picture is modified when the field becomes comparable to the zero - field peak energy , i.e. , close to the transition / crossover lines in fig .",
    "[ figphd1 ] . in the case of a purely local field , we observe that the spectral peak for one spin direction approaches the fermi level and becomes sharper as @xmath74 is decreased ; it diverges _ at _ the phase transition as @xmath68 , whereas the spectrum for the opposite spin broadens and remains non - critical . for a uniform field",
