    "thus , in order to realise such devices , the mae of fept needs to be maintained ( if possible , enhanced ) .",
    "the effect of the fe / fept interface on the fept mae is , therefore , a very important aspect .",
    "the aim of the present work is to investigate in detail the effect of the fe / fept interface on the exchange coupling and the mae of an fe / fept / fe system by means of first - principles calculations .",
    "we compare the results of a geometrically relaxed fe / fept / fe system to the corresponding results for an unrelaxed such system .",
    "the latter is similar to the system studied by sabiryanov and jaswal @xcite .",
    "we use castep @xcite to obtain the relaxed ionic coordinates of an fe / fept / fe system .",

    "importantly , the ab - initio calculations show that the relaxed system exhibits a reduced interfacial exchange coupling . mapping",
    "this information onto the linear chain model shows that this reduction gives rise to a discontinuity in the magnetization at the fept / fe interface .",

    "nonetheless the dw is continuous across the interface , in contrast to the case of the reduced exchange of the relaxed microstructure .",
    "the effect of the reduced exchange on the coercivity is relatively weak , consistent with the results given in ref .",
    "however , even relatively small changes can be significant for the design and operation of practical recording media .",
    "we have presented first principles calculations of the exchange interactions and the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy ( mae ) in an fe / fept / fe sandwich system . in particular",
    ", we investigated how the geometrical relaxation influences the calculated magnetic properties of the system . in accordance with previous work on an unrelaxed fe / fept / fe system @xcite",
    ", we found a dramatic reduction in the exchange coupling between the fe layers at the fe / fept ( soft / hard ) interface .",
    "moreover , in the relaxed system , these layers add a remarkable positive contribution to the mae . from the tensorial exchange interactions evaluated by means of the relativistic torque method @xcite we have shown that the mae of the fept slab and the interface mae are dominated by anisotropic inter - site exchange interactions .",
    "moreover , our calculations indicate that the formation of an fe / fept layer sequence reduces the perpendicular mae . in the case of a relaxed geometry , which we consider to be relevant to a multilayer system , this reduction is slight , on the order of @xmath125 mev per fept slab .",
    "+ we also show that the ab - initio parameters will have a bearing on the mesoscopic spin structures predicted by atomistic and micromagnetic models .",
    "specifically , the reduced exchange coupling between fept and fe layers gives rise to a discontinuous spin structure across the fept / fe interface .",
    "although the exchange spring effect still gives rise to a large coercivity reduction it is likely that the discontinuous spin structure could affect the magnetization dynamics .",
    "the reduced exchange could also affect the temperature dependence of the interface mae values , which could also have a significant bearing on the magnetic properties .",
    "both factors require the development of a detailed mapping onto an atomistic spin model .",
    "further , each material combination in a magnetic nanostructure will have interface properties which may differ significantly from the bulk , making further ab - initio studies of interface properties important in terms of the understanding of the underlying physics of static and dynamic magnetic properties .",
