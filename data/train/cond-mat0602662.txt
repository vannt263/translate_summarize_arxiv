    "lipid bilayer membranes constitute one of the most fundamental components of all living cells . apart from their obvious _ structural _ role in organizing distinct biochemical compartments , their contributions to essential _",
    "functions _ such as protein organization , sorting , or signalling are now well documented @xcite .",
    "in fact , their tasks significantly exceed mere passive separation or solubilization of proteins , since often _",
    "mechanical _ membrane properties are intricately linked to these biological functions , most visibly in all cases which go along with distinct membrane deformations , such as exo- and endocytosis @xcite , vesiculation @xcite , viral budding @xcite , cytoskeleton interaction @xcite , and cytokinesis @xcite .",
    "consequently , a quantitative knowledge of the material parameters which characterize a membrane s elastic response  most notably the bending modulus @xmath0  is also biologically desirable .",
    "several methods for the experimental determination of @xmath0 have been proposed , such as monitoring the spectrum of thermal undulations via light microscopy @xcite , analyzing the relative area change of vesicles under micropipette aspiration @xcite , or measuring the force required to pull thin membrane tethers @xcite . with the possible exception of the tether experiments , these techniques are _ global _ in nature , _ _ i.__@xmath1_e .",
    "_ , they supply information averaged over millions of lipids , if not over entire vesicles or cells . yet , in a biological context this may be insufficient @xcite .",
    "for instance , membrane properties such as their lipid composition or bilayer phase ( and thus mechanical rigidity ) have been proposed to vary on submicroscopic length scales @xcite . despite being biologically enticing ,",
    "this suggestion , known as the `` raft hypothesis '' , has repeatedly come under critical scrutiny @xcite , precisely because the existence of such small domains is extremely hard to prove .",
    "an obvious tool to obtain mechanical information for small samples is the atomic force microscope ( afm ) @xcite , and it has indeed been used to probe cell elastic properties ( such as for instance their young modulus ) @xcite . yet , obtaining truly _ local _ information still poses a formidable challenge .",
    "apart from several complications associated with the inhomogeneous cell surface and intra - cellular structures beneath the lipid bilayer , one particularly notable difficulty is that the basically unknown boundary conditions of the cell membrane away from the spot where the afm tip indents it preclude a quantitative interpretation of the measured force , _ _ i.__@xmath1_e .",

    "_  have recently suggested to spread the cell membrane over an adhesive substrate which features circular pores of well - defined radius @xcite . poking the resulting `` nanodrums '' would then constitute an elasto - mechanical experiment with precisely defined geometry . using simple model membranes , the authors could in fact",
    "show that a quantitative description of such measurements is possible using the standard continuum curvature - elastic membrane model due to canham @xcite and helfrich @xcite .    spreading a cellular membrane without erasing interesting local lipid structures",
    "obviously poses an experimental challenge ; but the setup also faces another problem which has its origin in an `` elastic curiosity '' : even significant indentations , which require the full _ nonlinear _ version of the helfrich shape equations for their correct description , end up displaying force - distance - curves which are more or less _ linear_a finding in accord with the initial regime of membrane tether pulling @xcite . yet",
    ", this simple functional form makes a unique extraction of the two main mechanical properties , tension and bending modulus , difficult .",
    "is the nanodrum setup thus futile ?    in the present work we develop the theoretical basis for a slight extension of the nanodrum experiment that will help to overcome this impasse . we will show that an additional _ adhesion _ between the afm tip and the pore - spanning membrane will change the situation very significantly  quantitatively and qualitatively .",
    "force - distance - curves cease to be linear , hysteresis , nonzero detachment forces and membrane overhangs can show up , and various new stable and unstable equilibrium branches emerge .",
    "the magnitude and characteristics of all these new effects can be quantitatively predicted using well established techniques which have previously been used successfully to study vesicle shapes @xcite , vesicle adhesion @xcite , colloidal wrapping @xcite or tether pulling @xcite .",

    "the membrane detaches from the tip at a radial distance @xmath5 .",
    "the two possible parametrizations @xmath6 and @xmath7 are explained in the beginning of chapter  [ sec : shapeeqn ] . ]",
    "the key `` ingredient '' underlying most of the new physics is the fact that the membrane can _ choose _ its point of detachment from the afm tip .",
    "unlike in the existing point force descriptions @xcite , in which a certain ( pushing or pulling ) force is applied at one point of the membrane , our description accounts for the fact that the generally nonvanishing interaction energy per unit area between tip and membrane co - determines their contact area over which they transmit forces , and thereby influence the entire force - distance - curve .",
    "what may at first seem like a minor modification of boundary conditions quickly proves to open a very rich and partly also complicated scenario , whose various facets may subsequently be used to extract information about the membrane .",
    "in fact , smith _ _ et__@xmath1_al._@xcite have demonstrated in a related situation that the competition between adhesion and tether pulling for substrate - bound vesicles gives rise to various first- and second - order transitions , details of which depend in a predictable way on the experimental setup . in our case",
    "we will for instance find snap - on and snap - off events between tip and membrane , which rest on the fact that binding is _ not _ pre - determined , and whose correct description is very important for reliably interpreting any afm force experiments .",
    "moreover , we will also see that the very occurrence of tethers is a much more subtle phenomenon , since an adhering membrane pulled upwards may in fact prefer to _ detach _ rather than being pulled into a tether  a question treated previously ( and on the linear level ) by boulbitch  @xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in chapter  [ sec : themodel ] we introduce the model of our system and discuss the relevant energies . in chapter",
    "[ sec : shapeeqn ] we present the equations that have to be solved in order to find membrane profiles , force - indentation curves and detachment forces .",
    "this will also include a treatment of the nonlinear case which was only mentioned very briefly in ref .",
    "@xcite . in chapter",
    "[ sec : results ] the results of our calculations are summarized and compared to existing @xcite measurements .",
    "we end in chapter  [ sec : discussion ] with a discussion how the predictions for indentation and adhesion characteristics can be used to extract material properties in future experiments .",
    "we consider a flat solid substrate with a circular pore of radius @xmath4 . a lipid bilayer membrane is adsorbed onto the substrate and spans the pore . in the situation",
    "we want to analyze an afm tip is used to probe the properties of the free pore - spanning membrane .",
    "we assume that the tip has a parabolic shape with curvature radius @xmath8 at its apex .",
    "furthermore , we restrict ourselves to the static axisymmetric situation in which the tip pokes the free - standing membrane exactly in the middle of the pore ( see fig .  [ fig : poregeometry ] ) .",
    "for a certain downward force @xmath9 the membrane is indented to a corresponding depth @xmath10 which is measured from the plane of the substrate to the depth of the apex of the tip .",
    "note that it is also possible to pull the membrane up with a force @xmath11 in the opposite direction if attractive interactions attach the membrane to the tip .    in the following ,",
    "we will model the bilayer as a two - dimensional surface .",
    "this is a valid approach provided the thickness of the membrane ( approx .",
    "5 nm ) is much smaller than ( i ) the membrane s lateral extension as well as ( ii ) length scales of interest such as local radii of curvature .    with this geometric setup in mind ,",
    "let us now consider the different energy contributions we want to include in our model .",
    "the total energy of the system `` pore - tip '' comprises different contributions : the membrane is under a",
    "_ lateral tension",
    "_ @xmath12 . to pull excess area into the pore",
    ", work has to be done against the adhesion between membrane and flat substrate @xcite .",
    "it is given by @xmath12 times the excess area @xcite .",
    "additionally , a _ curvature energy _ is associated with the membrane . according to canham @xcite and helfrich @xcite",
    "the hamiltonian for an up - down symmetric membrane is then @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the surface of the membrane part which spans the pore .",
    "the proportionality constants @xmath0 and @xmath15 are called bending rigidity and saddle - splay modulus , respectively . the gaussian curvature @xmath16 is the product of the two principal curvatures whereas @xmath17 is their sum @xcite .",
    "note that the last term of energy  ( [ eq : helfrich ] ) yields zero in our specific problem @xcite .    with the help of the two material constants @xmath12 and @xmath0 one can define a characteristic lengthscale @xmath18 which does not depend on geometric boundary conditions such as the radius of the tip or the pore but only on properties of the membrane . on scales larger than @xmath19 tension",
    "is the more important energy contributions ; on smaller scales bending dominates .",
    "apart from tension and bending , an _ adhesion between tip and membrane _ may contribute to the total energy .",
    "we assume that it is proportional to the contact area @xmath20 between tip and membrane with a proportionality constant @xmath21 , the adhesion energy per area .    if the indentation @xmath3 is given and one wants to determine the force @xmath2 , the total energy can thus be written as @xmath22 under certain circumstances , however , it is more convenient to consider the problem for a given force @xmath2 . both ensembles ( `` constant indentation '' _ vs. _ `` constant force '' ) are connected via a legendre transformation @xcite , @xmath23 .",
    "while the ground states one obtains for the two ensembles will be the same , questions of stability depend on the ensemble : a profile found to be stable under constant height conditions is not necessarily stable under constant force conditions .",
    "the route we want to follow here in order to find force - indentation curves is to determine the equilibrium shapes of the non - bound section of the membrane via a functional minimization .",
    "the energy contributions caused by the bounded section of the membrane enter via the appropriate boundary conditions ( see chapter  [ sec : shapeeqn ] and appendix  [ app : boundaryconditions ] ) .",
    "these imply that the contact point @xmath24 is not known a priori but has to be determined as well ( `` moving boundary problem '' ) . in the next section",
    "we will show how one can set up the appropriate mathematical formulation of the problem to get membrane profiles and force - indentation curves .",
    "to describe the shape of the membrane we use two different kinds of parametrization ( see fig .  [ fig : poregeometry ] ) : for the linear approximation it is sufficient to use `` monge '' gauge where the position of the membrane is given by a height @xmath6 above ( or below ) the underlying reference plane .",
    "the disadvantage of this parametrization is that it does not allow for `` overhangs '' .",
    "since these may be present in the full nonlinear problem , we will use the `` angle - arclength '' parametrization in the exact calculations : the angle @xmath7 with respect to the horizontal substrate as a function of arclength @xmath25 fully describes the shape .      to get the profile of the free membrane one has to solve the appropriate euler - langrange ( `` shape '' ) equation .",
    "this equation is typically a fourth order nonlinear partial differential equation and thus in most cases impossible to solve analytically .",
    "one may , however , consider cases where the membrane is indented only a little and gradients are small . in that case",
    "one may linearize the energy functional . in the constant indentation ensemble one",
    "gets for the free part @xmath26    \\ ; ,    \\label{eq : energyfunctionalconstantheight}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the area element on the flat reference plane and @xmath28 is the projected surface of the free pore - spanning membrane .",
    "the symbol @xmath29 denotes the two - dimensional nabla operator in the reference plane .",
    "the appropriate shape equation can be derived by setting the first variation of energy  ( [ eq : energyfunctionalconstantheight ] ) to zero , yielding @xmath30 the solution to this equation is a linear combination of the eigenfunctions of the laplacian corresponding to the eigenvalues 0 and @xmath31 . for axial symmetry",
    "it is given by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the modified bessel functions of the first and the second kind , respectively @xcite .",
    "the constants @xmath35 are determined from the appropriate boundary conditions ( see appendix  [ app : boundaryconditions ] ) :    [ eq : boundaryequationslinear ] @xmath36    where a dash denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath37 . even though the differential equation is of fourth order ,",
    "_ five _ conditions are required due to its moving boundary nature , _ _ i.__@xmath1_e .",
    "_ , @xmath24 is to be determined from an adhesion balance  which is in fact the origin of the fifth condition ( [ eq : boundeqlin3 ] ) ( see appendix  [ app : boundaryconditions ] ) .",
    "the solution of the boundary value problem  ( [ eq : shapeequationlinear],[eq : boundaryequationslinear ] ) can be used in two ways to calculate the force for a prescribed indentation : first , one can insert the profile back into the functional ( [ eq : energyfunctionalconstantheight ] ) to obtain the energy of the equilibrium solution , which will then parametrically depend on the indentation @xmath3 .",
    "its derivative with respect to @xmath3 yields the force @xmath2 .",
    "second , one can also consider stresses : in analogy to elasticity theory @xcite @xmath2 is given by the integral of the flux of surface stress @xcite through a closed contour around the tip .",
    "the second approach is used in the present work ; it has the advantage that the final expression for the force can be written in a closed form @xcite ( see also appendix  [ app : diffgeostress ] ) : @xmath38 this equation is _",
    "exact_. inserting the solution @xmath6 of the boundary value problem  ( [ eq : shapeequationlinear],[eq : boundaryequationslinear ] ) into ( [ eq : forcelinear ] ) yields the value of the force in the linear regime .    a little warning might be due here : expression  ( [ eq : forcelinear ] ) is evaluated at the rim of the pore where the profile is flat even for high indentations .",
    "one might thus wonder whether inserting the small gradient solution would actually lead to an exact result .",
    "this is , however , not the case , because the membrane shape at the rim predicted by the linear calculation is not identical with the prediction from the full nonlinear theory  except for its flatness , which is enforced by the boundary conditions .",
    "there is no magical way to avoid solving the nonlinear shape equation if one wants the exact answer .",
    "let us now shift to the angle - arclength parametrization and consider the full nonlinear problem . in principle , the constant height ensemble could be used here as well .",
    "it is , however , technically much easier to fix @xmath2 instead in order to reduce the number of boundary conditions one has to fulfill at the rim of the pore ( see below and appendix  [ app : numericalmethod ] ) .    in this paragraph all variables with a tilde are scaled with @xmath39 , _ _ i.__@xmath1_e . _ : @xmath40 , @xmath41 , etc .",
    "the energy functional of the free membrane can then be written as @xcite : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the arclength at the contact point @xmath24 and @xmath44 the arclength at @xmath4 .",
    "the dot denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath25 .",
    "the langrange multiplier functions @xmath45 and @xmath46 ensure that the geometric conditions @xmath47 and @xmath48 are fulfilled everywhere .    in order to make the numerical integration easier",

    "this analysis shows that it appears impossible to pull tethers using a probe with a certain binding energy , despite existing experiments in which tethers of micrometer size were generated @xcite .",

    "since @xmath12 and @xmath0 are the same for all pore sizes in that case , it should be possible to extract their value from the measured force - distance curves .",

    "the elastic constants can also be obtained by considering systems where the adhesion @xmath21 between tip and membrane has been increased experimentally . as we have seen , the curves change their behavior dramatically for @xmath164 .",
    "it should thus be possible to fit two parameters to the resulting curves which would yield a local @xmath0 and @xmath12 in one fell swoop whereas @xmath21 can simultaneously be determined from the snap - on of the tip upon approach to the bilayer .",

    "one also has to keep in mind that the assumption of a perfect parabolic tip is quite simplistic compared to the experimental situation .",
    "it is probably valid in the vicinity of the apex but generally fails further up .",
    "since the force - distance behavior close to the depth - saturation depends strongly on the actual tip shape , one can only use that part of the force - distance curve for data interpretation where the indentation is still small . to predict the whole behavior the exact indenter shape has to be known :",
