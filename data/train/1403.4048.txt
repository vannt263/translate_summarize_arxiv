    "the height is a tool that is ubiquitous in diophantine geometry and approximation .",

    "it is also called the _ essential minimum _ of @xmath2 with respect to @xmath4 , and denoted @xmath15 .",
    "these successive minima contain important information on the height function .",
    "the effective version of the generalized bogomolov conjecture asks for an explicit lower bound for the essential minimum of certain varieties in terms of geometric and arithmetic data .",

    "by contrast , theorems [ thm:5 ] and [ thm:7 ] are very concrete and well - suited for computations .",
    "for example , they allow to compute the successive minima of the canonical height on translates of subtori of a projective space as the maximum of a piecewise affine concave function on the polytope ( proposition [ prop:10 ] ) . the following example illustrates this computation .",
    "let @xmath36 be the cubic curve given as the image of the map @xmath37 let @xmath38 be the metrized divisor of @xmath39 given by the hyperplane at infinity equipped with the canonical metric , and let @xmath4 be the restriction of @xmath38 to @xmath40 .",

    "this observation is relevant when applying the known equidistribution results on galois orbits of small points in the toric case .    by replacing the height of the variety by its @xmath56-arithmetic volume , zhang s lower bound for the essential minimum extends to the case when the metrics are not necessarily semipositive : if @xmath2 is a proper variety of dimension @xmath3 over a number field and @xmath4 is a metrized divisor on @xmath2 with @xmath18 big , then @xmath57 see for instance ( * ? ? ?",
