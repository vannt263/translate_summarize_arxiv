    "the critical behavior of nonequilibrium lattice models with absorbing states has attracted a great deal of interest in recent years .",
    "it has been shown that most models exhibiting a continuous phase transition to a _ unique _ absorbing state belong to the same universality class .",
    "the best known examples are probably directed percolation ( dp ) @xcite , reggeon field theory @xcite , the contact process @xcite , and schlgl s first and second models @xcite@xcite .",
    "extensive studies of these and many other models @xcite@xcite have revealed that the critical exponents are unaffected by a wide range of changes in the evolution rules .",
    "this provides firm support for the dp conjecture , first stated by janssen @xcite and grassberger @xcite , that directed pecolation is the generic critical behavior of models exhibiting a continuous transition into a unique absorbing state .",
    "the study of models with more than one absorbing state is in an early stage , and there is still some controversy regarding the possible universality classes for such models .",
    "models with _ infinitely _ many absorbing states arise naturally in the study of reactions catalysed by a surface as soon as the absorption mechanism for the various species requires more than one vacant site . some studies of such models @xcite in two dimensions indicated that they did not belong to the universality class of directed percolation",
    ". however , the exponent estimates varied significantly from model to model and could therefore not be consistent with just a single new universality class .",
    "while the exponent estimates quoted in some studies clearly ruled out dp critical behavior , those of other studies differed only marginally from the dp values . on the other hand , studies of several one - dimensional models @xcite clearly placed these in the dp universality class , at least as far as the _ static _",
    "critical behavior is concerned . in all of these models",
    "the number of absorbing configurations grows exponentially with system size , though the absorbing configurations are characterized by the vanishing of a unique quantity , e.g. , the number of particle pairs @xcite or in other cases @xcite the number of nearest neighbor vacancy pairs .",
    "although there still is some evidence suggesting that models with infinitely many absorbing state may exhibit non - dp critical behavior , generally it seems that such models belong to the dp universality class . in this article i present results from a study of the dimer - trimer model , introduced by khler and ben - avraham @xcite , which shows that this model , despite earlier evidence to the contrary , also belongs to the dp universality class .",
    "this result lends further support to the extensions of the dp conjecture to models with multiple components @xcite and/or infinitely many absorbing states @xcite , at least in cases where the absorbing states are characterized by the vanishing of a unique quantity .",
    "the remainder of this article is organised as follows .",
    "in section  [ sec - model ] i will briefly present the various models and review the results of previous studies .",
    "i will present the results from my study of the dimer - trimer in section  [ sec - dt ] and summarise and discuss the evidence regarding universality in section  [ sec - sum ] .",
    "the dimer - trimer lattice model for heterogeneous catalysis for the reaction @xmath1a@xmath2b@xmath3 ab was introduced by khler and ben - avraham @xcite .",
    "adsorption of dimers ( trimers ) is attempted with probability @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) and succeeds if the molecule hits a pair ( triplet ) of nearest neighbor empty sites .",
    "immediately upon adsorption the dimer ( trimer ) dissociates and each site of the pair ( triplet ) becomes occupied by one a ( b ) particle . if a and b particles happen to become nearest neighbors they react and the ab product desorbs at once , leaving behind two empty sites .",
    "configurations with only isolated empty sites and adsorbed particles are absorbing ; the number of such configurations grows exponentially with lattice size .",
    "simulations @xcite revealed that when @xmath6 the system enters a trimer - saturated state with only adsorbed @xmath7 particles and isolated empty sites .",
    "likewise a dimer - saturated state is reached for @xmath8 , and only for intermediate values does the system possess an active steady state in which the production of ab goes on indefinitely .",
    "the transition at @xmath9 is continuous whereas the transition at @xmath10 is discontinuous .",
    "critical exponents @xmath11 and",
    "@xmath12 describing , respectively , the behavior of the density of a and b particles near @xmath13 may be defined as : @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the saturation concentration of b at @xmath13 .",
    "steady state computer simulations @xcite yielded @xmath17 and @xmath18 . for directed percolation in ( 2 + 1)-dimensions @xmath19 ( this estimate is obtained using the scaling relation @xmath20 @xcite with @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xcite ) . while the estimate for @xmath11 is well above the dp value",
    "the estimate for @xmath12 is marginally consistent with it .",
    "the dimer - trimer model was also studied using time - dependent simulations .",
    "the general idea of time - dependent simulations is to start from a configuration which is very close to the absorbing state , and then follow the  average \" time evolution of this configuration by simulating a large ensemble of independent realisations @xcite . out of the many possibile ( near - absorbing ) initial states , khler and ben - avraham used absorbing states _ generated by the critical system _ , and then placed a triplet of vacancies at the center ( see the next section for more details ) . as usual in this type of simulation they measured the survival probability @xmath23 , the average number of empty sites @xmath24 , and the average mean square distance of spreading @xmath25 from the origin .",
    "these quantities are expected to exhibit power - law behavior at @xmath13 characterized by exponents @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "the estimates for the dimer - trimer model @xcite , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , clearly differ from the dp values @xcite , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "these results led to the conclusion that the dimer - trimer model belongs to a new universality class .",
    "as already mentioned the results of my study of this model ( reported in section  [ sec - dt ] ) do _ not _ support this conclusion but shows that the dimer - trimer model belongs to the dp universality class .    the dimer - dimer ( dd ) model @xcite is based on the oxidation of hydrogen on a metal surface .",
    "o@xmath35 adsorption is attempted with probability @xmath4 , and h@xmath35 adsorption with probability @xmath5 .",
    "both o@xmath35 and h@xmath35 require a nearest neighbor pair of vacancies ; both dissociate upon adsorption . whenever h and o are nearest neighbors they react to form oh , which resides at a single site .",
    "similarly , oh reacts with neighboring h , forming h@xmath35o which desorbs immediately .",
    "in addition adsorbed h atoms are allowed to diffuse on the surface .",
    "the dd model has been studied in several versions including further processes such as , recombination and desorption of h@xmath35 , desorption of oh , and reactions between neighboring oh molecules ( leading to the formation and desorption of h@xmath35o leaving behind one adsorbed o atom ) .",
    "depending on which processes are included the dd model exhibits one or two continuous phase transitions . for @xmath6 , the steady state is absorbing and comprised of a mixture of o , oh and isolated vacancies . in certain versions of the model the lattice becomes saturated with h for @xmath8  a unique absorbing state . for @xmath36",
    "there is an active steady state with ongoing production of h@xmath35o .",
    "monte carlo simulations @xcite generally yielded estimates for @xmath37 with an uncertainty of approximately 5 - 10% , where @xmath38 describe the power - law decay of various densities at @xmath13 .",
    "however , in certain cases it was found @xcite that @xmath39 or 1 .",
    "most of the results are not consistent with directed percolation and could indicate that the dd model belongs to a new universality class .",
    "however , one would expect the exponents , corresponding to different densities , to be equal .",
    "the difference in some of the reported values thus suggests substantial statistical uncertainties .",
    "jensen and dickman studied two simpler models , the pair contact process ( pcp ) and the dimer reaction ( dr ) model , presenting infinitely many absorbing states in the simpler context of single - component , one - dimensional models @xcite . in the pcp ,",
    "nearest neighbor pairs of particles annihilate mutually ( with probability @xmath4 ) or else ( with probability @xmath5 ) create a new particle at an empty nearest neighbor .",
    "any configuration without pairs is absorbing ; there are evidently many such states ( @xmath40 on a 1-d lattice of @xmath41 sites ) .",
    "steady state simulations , including a thorough finite - size scaling analysis , yielded exponent estimates consistent with dp critical behavior . in the one - dimensional dr , particles are not allowed to occupy neighboring sites .",
    "if sites @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are vacant adsorption may take place at site @xmath42 .",
    "suppose a particle has just arrived at site @xmath42 .",
    "if sites @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 are all vacant , the particle remains .",
    "if any of the four sites are occupied , the new particle reacts with one other particle with probability @xmath5 , and remains with probability @xmath4 .",
    "the second neighbors have priority in the reaction .",
    "any configuration without triplets of empty sites is absorbing .",
    "again steady state simulations ( including finite - size scaling ) revealed critical behavior in the dp universality class .",
    "another single - component model which exhibits a continuous phase transition from an active steady state to one of a multitude of absorbing configurations is the _ threshold transfer process _",
    "( ttp ) @xcite . in the ttp sites",
    "may be vacant , or singly or doubly occupied , which can be described by an occupation variable @xmath49 or 2 .",
    "if @xmath50,then @xmath51 with probability @xmath4 ; if @xmath52 , then @xmath53 with probability @xmath5 . in the absence of doubly - occupied sites ,",
    "the dynamics trivially leads to a steady state in which a fraction @xmath4 of the sites have @xmath54 . when @xmath55 particles may move to neighboring sites .",
    "if @xmath56 , one particle moves to that site ; likewise , a particle moves from @xmath42 to @xmath44 if @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath58 is diminished accordingly in this deterministic , particle - conserving transfer .",
    "configurations devoid of doubly - occupied sites form an absorbing subspace with trivial dynamics and can be avoided only if @xmath4 is sufficiently large .",
    "simulations @xcite revealed that the steady state critical behavior placed the ttp in the dp universality class .",
    "recently , yaldram _ et al .",
    "_ , studied the critical behavior of a model for the co+no@xmath59 co@xmath35+@xmath1n@xmath35 catalytic surface reaction .",
    "with probability @xmath4 a co molecule is adsorbed on an empty site and with probability @xmath5 no adsorption is attempted .",
    "no dissociates upon adsorption and therefore requires a nearest neighbor pair of empty sites .",
    "after each adsorption the nearest neighbors are checked ( in random order ) and co+o reacts to form co@xmath35 which leaves the surface at once , likewise n+n forms n@xmath35 which desorbs immediately .",
    "computer simulations by yaldram _",
    "@xcite showed that when @xmath6 the system enters an absorbing state in which the lattice is covered by a mixture of o and n. again , the number of absorbing configurations grows exponentially with system size . at @xmath13",
    "the model exhibits a _ continuous _ phase transition into an active state in which the catalytic process can prodeed indefinetely .",
    "finally when @xmath4 exceeds a second critical value @xmath60 the model exhibits a _ discontinuous _ phase transition into a co and n covered state . near the critical point @xmath13 one",
    "expects the concentrations @xmath61 of various lattice sites @xmath62 ( @xmath62 = o , n , co , or an empty site ) to follow simple power laws , @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the saturation concentration .",
    "_ @xcite found that @xmath65 , which is much smaller than the dp value .",
    "this could indicate that the co - no model belongs to a new universality class .",
    "however a more thorough study @xcite yielded exponent estimates consistent with dp critical behavior .",
    "in this section i report the results of extensive time - dependent and steady state simulations of the dimer - trimer model including a thorough finite - size scaling analysis .",
    "the model was studied on a triangular lattice with each site either empty or occupied by a single a or b particle . in the actual simulations dimer ( trimer )",
    "adsorption is attempted with probability @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "close to the critical value @xmath13 the lattice soon becomes covered with b - particles .",
    "since all processes depend on the presence of nearest neighbor pairs or triplets of empty sites an efficient algorithm uses a list of non - isolated empty sites or active sites . by chosing the first site ( randomly ) from the list of active sites the time spent on failed adsorption attempts is greatly reduced .",
    "dimer adsorption proceeds via chosing ( at random ) a nearest neighbor of the active site and placing a - particles on these sites if the second site is empty . for trimer adsorption two nearest neighbors of the actice site are chosen such that the sites constitute the vertices of an equilateral triangle and adsorption takes place if all sites are empty .",
    "after each attempted adsorption the time variable is incremented by @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the number of active sites prior to the attempt .",
    "each time step thus equals ( on the average ) one attempted update per lattice site . after each successful adsorption",
    "the neighbors of newly adsorbed particles are checked to see if a - b pairs were formed and such pairs are removed . if an a or b particle is part of more than one pair a random choice is made between the different a - b pairs .",
    "time - dependent simulations @xcite is generally the most efficient way of obtaining a precise estimate for the location of the critical point in models with absorbing states .",
    "the general idea is to study the average evolution of a system which initially is very close to an absorbing state . for models with a _",
    "unique _ absorbing state this is a very simple procedure yielding accurate estimates for both the critical point and various critical exponents describing the critical power - law behavior of quantities such as the survival probability or the average number of active sites . for models with multiple absorbing state",
    "the situation is more intricate .",
    "a recent study @xcite showed that the critical exponents depend upon the choice of initial configuration .",
    "however , two important facts emerged from this study , first of all the value of the _ critical point _ was always predicted correctly , and secondly by using an initial configuration generated by running the system at the critical point starting from an empty lattice the predictions for the dynamical critical exponents coincide with those expected from the static critical behavior . a recent more thorough study by mendes _",
    "_ @xcite confirmed this picture and led to a generalized scaling ansatz for models with multiple absorbing states . in this study",
    "i generate the initial configuration by simulating the dimer - trimer model on a 128@xmath68128 lattice ( with periodic boundary conditions ) at the value of @xmath4 under investigation until it enters an absorbing state .",
    "an off - set @xmath69 is then chosen randomly on this lattice .",
    "hereafter the configuration is mapped cyclically onto a larger ( 512@xmath68512 ) lattice such that the state of site @xmath70 on the large lattice is the same as that of site @xmath71 on the small lattice .",
    "hereafter a triplet of nearest neighbor empty sites is placed at the origin .",
    "the size of the large lattice ensures that the cluster of empty sites grown from the seed at the origin never reaches the boundaries of the lattice .",
    "we thus start in a configuration close to an absorbing state ( just three sites are open ) and it should be close to a typical absorbing state of the infinite system . for each value of @xmath4",
    "i simulated 50 independent configurations and for each such configuration i simulated 5000 independent samples for a total of 250,000 samples .",
    "each run had a maximal duration of 2000 time steps , but most samples entered an absorbing state before this limit was reached .",
    "i measured the survival probability @xmath23 ( the probability that the system has not entered an absorbing state at time @xmath72 ) , the average number of active sites @xmath24 , and the average mean square distance of spreading @xmath25 from the center of the lattice .",
    "notice that @xmath24 is averaged over all runs whereas @xmath25 is averaged only over the surviving runs . in accordance with the scaling ansatz for models with a unique absorbing state @xcite",
    "one expects that these quantities have the following scaling form ,    @xmath73    where @xmath74 is the distance from the critical point , and @xmath75 is the correlation length exponent in the time direction .",
    "if @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 are non - singular at the origin then asymptotically ( @xmath79 ) @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 behave as power - laws at @xmath13 with critical exponents @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "generally there are corrections to the pure power law behavior so that , e.g. , @xmath23 is more accurately given by @xcite    @xmath80    and similarly for @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "more precise estimates for the critical exponents can be obtained if one looks at local slopes    @xmath81}{\\log(m ) } ,    \\label{eq : localslope}\\ ] ]    and similarly for @xmath82 and @xmath83 . in a plot of the local slopes vs @xmath84 the critical exponents are given by the intercept of the curve for @xmath13 with the @xmath85-axis .",
    "the off - critical curves often have very notable curvature , i.e. , one will see the curves for @xmath6 veering downward while the curves for @xmath86 veer upward .",
    "this enables one to obtain accurate estimates for @xmath13 and the critical exponents . in fig .",
    "1 i have plotted the local slopes for various values of @xmath4 . from the plot of @xmath82",
    "it is clear that the two lower curves , corresponding to @xmath87 , and 0.3420 , veer downward showing that @xmath88 .",
    "likewise the upper curve , @xmath89 , has a pronounced upward curvature .",
    "i therefore conclude that @xmath90 .",
    "this estimate differs quite a bit from that of khler and ben - avraham ( @xmath91 ) , which is probably due to slightly different algorithms . from the intercept of the critical curves with the @xmath85-axis i estimate @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "these values agree very well with those obtained from computer simulations of directed percolation in ( 2 + 1)-dimensions @xcite , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "from these results it seems reasonable to conclude that the dimer - trimer model belongs to the dp universality class .",
    "however , due to the somewhat arbitrary choice of the initial configuration employed in the time - dependent simulations it would be nice to validate this conclusion through other means . to this end i have also performed extensive steady state simulations using a finite - size scaling analysis .",
    "finite - size scaling , though originally developed for equilibrium systems , is also applicable to nonequilibrium second - order phase transitions as demonstrated by aukrust _",
    "_ @xcite . as in equilibrium",
    "second - order phase transitions one assumes that the ( infinite - size ) system features a length scale which diverges at criticality as , @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the correlation length exponent in the space direction .",
    "the basic finite - size scaling ansatz is that the various quantities depend on system - size only through the scaled length @xmath97 , or equivalently through the variable @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the linear extension of the system .",
    "near the critical point @xmath13 one would expect the steady state concentrations @xmath61 of various lattice sites @xmath62 , @xmath62 = a , b , active sites or empty sites ( note that empty sites include only the isolated vacancies ) , to follow simple power laws ,    @xmath100    where @xmath64 is the saturation concentration .",
    "note that the saturation concentration for active sites and a is zero , whereas it is non - zero for b and empty sites .",
    "thus we assume that the density of various sites depends on system size and distance from the critical point as :    @xmath101    such that at the critical point @xmath13 @xmath102    @xmath61 , and other quantities , are averaged over the _ surviving _ samples only .",
    "2 shows a plot of the average concentration of sites @xmath103 as a function of @xmath104 at the critical point , @xmath105 .",
    "all simulations were performed on lattices of size @xmath106 using periodic boundary conditions . the maximal number of timesteps in each trial , @xmath107 , and number independent samples , @xmath108 , varied from @xmath109 , @xmath110 for @xmath111 to @xmath112 , @xmath113 for @xmath114 .",
    "the slope of the line drawn in the figure is @xmath115 , which comes from the dp estimate @xmath116 , using the earlier cited estimate for @xmath117 and @xmath118 @xcite .",
    "the data falls very nicely on the line drawn using the dp estimate thus confirming that the model belongs to the dp universality class .    near the critical point",
    "the order parameter fluctuations grow like a power law , @xmath119 , from which we expect the following finite - size scaling form ,    @xmath120    such that at @xmath13 @xmath121    fig .",
    "3 shows a plot of @xmath122 $ ] vs @xmath104 , as obtained from the fluctuations of the number of active sites .",
    "the slope of the straight line is 0.39 as obtained from the dp value @xmath123 , where i used that @xmath124 with @xmath125 @xcite .",
    "the excellent agreement between the data and the dp - expectation confirms the dp critical behavior of this model .",
    "one expects a characteristic time for the system , say the relaxation time , to scale like    @xmath126    such that at @xmath13 @xmath127    in fig .",
    "4 i have plotted @xmath128 $ ] , where @xmath129 is the time it takes for half the samples to enter an absorbing state , as a function of @xmath130 .",
    "the slope of the line drawn in the figure is @xmath131 , as obtained from the dp estimate @xcite @xmath132 .",
    "the dp estimate is derived from the scaling relation @xmath133 using the earlier cited estimate for @xmath28 . as can be seen",
    "the data for the dimer - trimer model is again fully compatible with dp critical behavior .",
    "finally i have studied the steady state behavior of the density of sites .",
    "as mentioned earlier @xmath134 should go to zero like a power - law at @xmath13 . in fig .",
    "5 i have plotted these quantities as a function of the distance from the critical point on a log - log scale , using @xmath135 for b particles and 0.1065 for isolated empty sites .",
    "the results were obtained by averaging over typically 100 independent samples . the number of time steps and system sizes varied from @xmath136 , @xmath137 far from @xmath13 to @xmath138 , @xmath139 closest to @xmath13 .",
    "the slope of the straight line is 0.59 as obtained from the dp estimate . from this figure",
    "it is clear that all densities have the same asymptotic power - law behavior and once again confirm that the model belongs to the dp universality class .",
    "previous studies of various two - component models in two dimensions exhibiting a continuous phase transition into a non - unique absorbing state @xcite , yielded non - dp behavior",
    ". however , with the results reported in the previous section and in an earlier article @xcite , it is now clear that of these both the dimer - trimer model @xcite and the co - no model @xcite belong to the dp universality class .",
    "likewise , results for the one - dimensional versions of the pair contact process @xcite , dimer reaction model @xcite and the threshold transfer process @xcite clearly placed these models in the dp universality class . in all of these models the absorbing states can be uniquely characterized by the vanishing of a single quantity . more and more evidence",
    "thus confirm that the dp conjecture can be extended to such models , as first suggested in ref .",
    "the exponent estimates for the various versions of the dimer - dimer model are not consistent with directed percolation .",
    "however , the typical value for @xmath140 ( with an uncertainty of @xmath141 ) is not very far from the dp value . in view of this , and the similarity of these models to the dimer - trimer and co - no models , it does not seem unlikely that the dd models also belong to the dp universality class .",
