    "strong coulomb electron - electron ( e - e ) interactions can drive transitions from metallic to exotic insulating states , the most well known of which are the mott - hubbard semiconductor ( mhs ) and the wigner crystal ( wc ) .",
    "the mhs is a characteristic of systems with carrier concentration per site @xmath5 and is driven by strong onsite e - e repulsion , the hubbard @xmath6 interaction . depending upon the lattice structure the critical @xmath6",
    "at which the metal - insulator ( mi ) transition occurs , @xmath7 , can be 0@xmath8 or finite @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the wc occurs in systems with @xmath9 , and is characterized by charge - ordering ( co ) , _ i.e. _ , a periodic arrangement of _ single _ charge carriers on the lattice .",
    "the wc is driven by strong onsite as well as inter - site coulomb interactions @xcite .",
    "although in principle the wc is likely at any arbitrary @xmath10 , it has been been studied most intensively for @xmath11 bipartite lattices , where the nearest neighbor ( n.n ) coulomb repulsion can drive the mi transition @xcite .",
    "the combined effects of e - e and electron - phonon ( e - p ) interactions are also of interest , usually in one dimension ( 1d ) , where the mhs can further exhibit the spin - peierls ( sp ) transition .",
    "importantly for our purpose here the above semiconducting states have been intensively studied over the past several decades , and are largely understood , although arguments regarding the magnitude of @xmath7 for formation of the mhs state in specific lattices or the detailed mechanism of the mi transition may continue to persist . in the present work , we discuss a new correlated - electron semiconductor , the paired - electron crystal ( pec ) , that occurs in @xmath11 systems in the presence of moderate to strong geometric lattice frustration @xcite .",
    "we believe that our work has direct application to 2:1 cationic or 1:2 anionic charge - transfer solids ( cts ) that exhibit correlated insulator ",
    "sc transitions , and further applies to other inorganic strongly - correlated @xmath4-filled materials .",
    "the combined effects of e - e interactions and geometric lattice frustration are of strong current interest @xcite .",
    "the bulk of the work here is for @xmath5 , where the hubbard model in the limit @xmath12 reduces to the heisenberg spin hamiltonian .",
    "interest in the consequences of lattice frustration stems from the seminal proposal by anderson that the ground state of the heisenberg antiferromagnet ( haf ) model on a triangular lattice is a quantum spin liquid ( qsl ) with no spin ordering even at zero temperature@xcite .",
    "the type of wavefunction usually assumed to describe a qsl is often referred to as a resonating valence bond ( rvb ) state . whether or not rvb states appear in the square lattice for @xmath10 slightly different from 1 , and the relationship of such states to superconductivity ( sc ) in doped strongly correlated semiconductors remains contentious .",
    "an extension of the rvb theory of dopant - induced sc in @xmath13 is the proposal that frustration - induced sc occurs in the anisotropic triangular lattice within the simple hubbard model even for @xmath10 exactly 1 , where a narrow superconducting phase is straddled on both sides by broader paramagnetic metallic ( pm ) and antiferromagnetic ( afm ) insulator phases @xcite .",
    "it has been claimed that this transition explains the sc in the cts @xcite .",
    "recent numerical work by us and others , however , have determined that sc is absent within the @xmath5 triangular lattice hubbard model @xcite and the earlier results are artifacts of mean - field approximations .",
    "while the ground state of the haf on the isotropic triangular lattice is now known to be the ordered 120@xmath14 afm rather than the originally proposed qsl state @xcite , other frustrated lattices , most notably the kagom lattice @xcite , have been investigated in the search for qsl states .",
    "proposed ground states here include various types of qsl states @xcite as well as valence - bond solid ( vbs ) states @xcite .",
    "the literature on vbs states has a long history going back to the well known ghosh - majumdar model @xcite .",
    "the common theme in works on vbs is the frustration - driven transition from the afm state to a total spin @xmath15 singlet state .",
    "we have found a similar frustration - driven transition from the afm to a @xmath15 state in strongly correlated systems with @xmath11 , where reduction to a spin hamiltonian is not possible .",
    "in contrast to the voluminous literature on correlated and frustrated systems at @xmath5 , the literature on frustrated @xmath13 is relatively sparse and new .",
    "the discovery of sc@xcite in hydrated na@xmath16coo@xmath1 has spurred interest in correlated systems away from @xmath5 @xcite , although to the best of our knowledge only isotropic triangular lattices have been studied .",
    "we will specifically focus on @xmath11 within the present work  on the triangular lattice with varying anisotropy . in the square lattice limit at this density",
    ", we show that spontaneous in - phase dimerization occurs in the presence of electron - phonon interactions modulating n.n hopping integrals , leading to an _ effective _ @xmath5 system with one electron per dimer and afm order .",
    "this result is the origin of the so - called the dimer mott - hubbard model @xcite that is commonly used to describe the 2:1 cationic or 1:2 anionic organic cts .",
    "very recently we have proposed that under the influence of lattice frustration this dimer mott - hubbard afm state gives way to a spin - paired state that we termed the pec @xcite .",
    "the pec is different from any of the above more well known correlated semiconducting states in that it is a wc of heitler - london spin - singlets  simultaneously charged - ordered and spin @xmath15 . alternately , the pec is the @xmath11 equivalent of the @xmath5 vbs .",
    "a conceptually similar state was postulated for the electron gas many years back by moulopoulos and ashcroft @xcite .",
    "there is a fundamental similarity between this earlier work and ours , in that in both cases the pairing is driven by the exchange interaction .",
    "our previous work @xcite only considered a limited set of parameters , and the full phase diagram was not discussed .",
    "here we give a more complete phase diagram , including the competition with the wc state that was ignored before . as with the vbs state at @xmath5 ,",
    "the pec is a consequence of frustration - induced quantum effects .",
    "its extraordinary stability at @xmath11 is a commensurability effect ( recall that mhs and wc formation also require commensurability ) .    in section [ model ]",
    "we introduce the model we consider .",
    "we include e - p interactions to stabilize the lattice dimerization that gives the effective @xmath5 dimer lattice .",
    "we present the physical mechanism behind the pec formation by briefly discussing simple molecular clusters , for which we show that spin - singlet formation in @xmath11 necessarily requires charge disproportionation .",
    "the charge disproportionation in the infinite one - dimensional ( 1d ) chain and the so - called zigzag ladder leads to periodic co , viz . , the simplest pecs . following the discussions of these simple cases , we introduce the two - dimensional ( 2d ) lattice that will be the focus of this work , and discuss the different possible phases .",
    "in section [ results ] we present out numerical results for the 2d system , covering a wide region of parameter space . in section [ discussion ] we discuss the relevance of our results for several classes of @xmath11 materials and the outlook for understanding unconventional sc .",
    "we particularly emphasize the cases of the organic charge - transfer solids cts @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1cu@xmath1(cn)@xmath2 and etme@xmath2sb[pd(dmit)@xmath1]@xmath1 which have been described as qsls within the effective @xmath5 scenario @xcite .",
    "we believe frustration - induced charge disproportionation is an alternate possibility .",

    "both @xmath29 and @xmath30 are determined self - consistently @xcite .",
    "@xmath27 are in general taken close to the minimum value needed for the transition to occur , our goal being the replication of the same instability from finite cluster calculations that would occur in the infinite system for @xmath33 coupling . @xmath6 and @xmath34 are on - site and n.n .",
    "coulomb interactions , respectively .",
    "the physically relevant range of @xmath34 is @xmath35 based on comparison between @xmath5 and @xmath11 cts @xcite .",
    "we first present a simple qualitative discussion of coupled spin - singlet and co formation at @xmath11 .",
    "the ideas are quite general and we argue that the mechanism is _ independent _ of dimensionality .",
    "the key requirement is that the density must be exactly @xmath11 , as the effect requires commensurability .",
    "consider a single dimer of two sites with one electron .",
    "the electron populations per site are 0.5 each , but the quantum mechanical wavefunction for the system is the superposition @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are site charge densities .",
    "if one now brings two of these dimers together , as in insert ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ cofig ] , the composite wavefunction of the two - dimer system can be written as @xmath39 . if the two electrons are in a spin - singlet state then within the simple hubbard hamiltonian the configuration @xmath40 , in which singlet stabilization can occur from a single n.n .",
    "hop that creates a virtual double occupancy , must dominate over the configurations @xmath41 and @xmath42 , in which singlet stabilization requires two and three hops , respectively .",
    "thus as the singlet bond between the dimers gets stronger we expect a charge difference @xmath43 between sites belonging to the same dimer ( nominally between sites 1 and 2 , or between sites 3 and 4 in the linear chain of fig .",
    "[ cofig ] ) .",
    "while some charge disproportionation must occur in finite linear chains from end effects alone , we note that our proposed picture demands that similar charge disproportionation occurs between members of the same dimer even in the case of the periodic molecule shown in the insert ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ cofig ] . in this case",
    "the charges on the sites connected by the diagonal bond must be larger than 0.5 , while the charges on the two other sites must be smaller .",
    "importantly , the modulation of charge density , bond orders , as well as spin - singlet pairing all occur cooperatively , and any of these observables may be used as an order parameter in the case of a real transition . in fig .",
    "[ cofig ] we have plotted @xmath43 versus the hopping integral @xmath44 corresponding to the dotted bonds in the molecules shown in the insert , for the ground spin - singlet state . in both cases , as @xmath44 increased from zero @xmath43 becomes nonzero and increases with @xmath44 .",
    "importantly , in the spin - triplet @xmath45 state the sign of @xmath43 is reversed in the cyclic molecule , indicating repulsive interaction among the electrons .",
    "coupled co and singlet formation occur also in the sp state in 1d @xmath11 systems @xcite .",
    "a key difference from the sp transition in @xmath5 is that for @xmath11 , a mi transition first occurs at a intermediate temperature , followed by the sp transition at low temperature . for @xmath11",

    "provided the n.n .",
    "coulomb interaction is not too strong , a sp transition occurs from either insulating state @xcite , resulting in a ground state with period-4 co @xmath460110@xmath46 .",
    "this state is the simplest realization of the pec and may visualized as a second dimerization of dimer units of molecules ; the singlet bond giving the spin gap ( sg ) forms _ between _ adjacent dimer units .",
    "the intermediate temperature bond - dimerized states , wc state , and pec state with sg are all found experimentally in quasi-1d cts @xcite .",
    "zigzag ladder systems , coupled two - stack systems in which each site on one stack is coupled to two sites on the other stack , are a second realization of the pec state .",
    "cts zigzag ladder materials that are @xmath11 have been found with spin - gap transition temperatures much larger than in 1d @xmath11 sp materials @xcite .",
    "the insulating ground state in this case may be understood again as a pec state occurring in a zigzag ladder lattice , with singlet bonds oriented between the two chains @xcite . unlike the 1d case ,",
    "bond orders are now modulated in several lattice directions , leading to a larger sg than for the 1d pec case @xcite .",
    "interestingly , in both the linear chain and the zigzag ladder , the @xmath11 pec is obtained by simply removing alternate spin - singlet bonds from the corresponding @xmath5 vbs , and replacing them with pairs of vacancies .      in this paper",

    "our work shows that only the afm phase is described by the dimer mott - hubbard model .",

    "equally perplexingly , c@xmath142 is independent of magnetic field up to 8 t , indicating absence of zeeman coupling of spins to the field @xcite .",
    "in contrast , thermal conductivity measurements down to 80 mk indicate a spin gap @xcite .",

    "the latter requires unequal site charges on the molecules within the dimer unit cells @xcite .",
    "it may be relevant in this context that @xmath143c - nmr experiments on both @xmath0-cn @xcite and dmit - sb @xcite find unusual line broadenings at low t that can not be ascribed to disorder @xcite , which might also indicate charge disproportionation .",
    "similar line broadening at low t in etme@xmath2p[(dmit)@xmath1]@xmath1 occurs at the transition to the pec @xcite , which in turn gives way to superconductivity under pressure @xcite .",
    "although it is as yet not entirely clear whether or not existing spin - liquid models @xcite with appropriate modifications can explain the above anomalies , it appears that for both @xmath0-cn and dmit - sb , spin degrees of freedom alone can not describe the low temperature ( below 6k in @xmath0-cn and below 1k in dmit - sb ) properties .",
    "rather , any description of the ground state must involve charge as well as spin degrees of freedom .",
    "assuming that the above experiments and their interpretations are correct , the proper theoretical model should have built - in significant electron - lattice coupling and should lead to charge disproportionation and excitation energy spectrum with gapless singlet excitations and gapped spin excitations .",
    "we believe that the highly frustrated @xmath11 model satisfies all of the above criteria , in addition to providing the starting point for a theory of superconductivity in the cts ( see below ) .",
    "t - linear specific heat but gapped magnetic susceptibility were noted in nonmetallic vanadium bronzes@xcite as far back as 1978 , and at the time was considered to be a distinctive proof for bipolarons .",
    "the nonzero spin - singlet degeneracy within this model comes from tunneling motion of the bipolarons , causing them to `` flip flop '' between equivalent configurations @xcite .",
    "we propose that a similar mechanism is at play in the present case at large @xmath44 . particularly in @xmath0-cn the lattice structure and",
    "the orientations of molecules are such that the spin - singlet bonds , which occur between monomers belonging to two neighboring dimers can flip flop between the monomers ( see fig .  4 in reference .",
    ") within our proposed picture for @xmath0-cn , the transition at 6k is to the spin - singlet charge - disproportionated state , with short range fluctuating order .",
    "magnetic excitations even in this state , however , require breaking the spin - singlet bonds .",
    "note that the observed difference between @xmath0-cn and dmit - sb is expected within the @xmath11 model , since the simple description as a triangular lattice of dimers is no longer enough and the detailed couplings between the monomers in the materials are indeed different because of their different crystal structures .      as mentioned above , numerical results for @xmath149",
    "are not useful due to the highly degenerate ground state becoming spin - triplet in our finite clusters .",
    "we have suggested elsewhere that the occupied spin - singlet bonded ` 11 ' sites of the pec can be thought of as _ effective _ single sites doubly occupied by charge carriers , and similarly the pairs of ` 00 ' vacancies can be thought of as single vacant sites @xcite .",
    "such a mapping would transform the pec to an effective checkerboard co with alternate sites ( in the square lattice representation ) occupied by double occupancies and vacancies . the effective hamiltonian that describes the checkerboard co in this case is a @xmath5 extended hubbard model with weak _ attractive _ @xmath6 whose origin is the exchange interaction that stabilizes the singlet bond within the original @xmath11 hamiltonian . the n.n .",

    "while such a mapping is not rigorous , similar mapping of n.n .",
    "spin - bonded sites to double occupancies has been routinely used in the literature on bipolaron models @xcite .",
    "the difference between our work and traditional bipolaron models is that the spin - singlet bonding within our work is driven primarily by afm correlations , while within the bipolaron models it is a consequence of effective attraction due to the overscreening of the e - e repulsion by e - p interactions @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the consequences of stronger frustration@xcite in the @xmath11 anisotropic triangular lattice within the effective @xmath5 extended hubbard model with attractive @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "we found a co - to - sc transition within the effective model @xcite , suggesting a pec - to - sc transition within the @xmath11 model with repulsive interactions .",
    "although this result is not a proof of transition to sc within the repulsive @xmath11 model , it nevertheless is instructive and provides the direction for future research .",
    "demonstration of sc within the actual model will require further work .",
    "what is interesting though is that the proposed scenario can give a unified approach to sc in all organic cts , irrespective of whether the insulating state proximate to sc is afm @xcite , co @xcite or vbs @xcite .",
    "recall that within existing mean field theories the afm - to - sc transition is driven by spin fluctuations @xcite , while the co - to - sc transition is driven by charge fluctuations @xcite . even if we ignore that recent precise numerical calculations @xcite have demonstrated the absence of sc within the proposed spin - fluctuation models in this context ( thereby raising doubts also about mean - field theory of charge - fluctuation mediated superconductivity ) , different mechanisms of sc for structurally related materials with identical or near - identical molecular components appear to be unrealistic . within our proposed scenario ,",
    "the charge - ordered or vbs systems that exhibit sc are pecs in the semiconducting state , while the afm systems under pressure transform to pecs first and then to sc",
    "( although due to actual crystal structures the `` width '' of the pec region could be narrow to vanishing within the latter ) .",
    "the sc phase within this scenario is a paired - electron liquid .",
    "there is considerable overlap between these ideas and the one proposed by moulopoulos and ashcroft for the continuous electron gas @xcite .",
    "the thrust of our work has been to understand within a unified theoretical approach the variety of exotic insulating states that are proximate to the superconducting state in 2:1 cationic or 1:2 anionic 2d cts .",
    "we have shown here that the peculiarities of these materials originate from the unique behavior of @xmath11 in the presence of both strong e - e interactions and lattice frustration .",
    "it is conceivable that the complex behavior of apparently unrelated inorganic families can be understood within the same broad theoretical approach .",
    "we list two such classes of materials below to point out the hitherto unnoticed similarities between them and @xmath11 cts .",
    "layered cobaltates na@xmath16coo@xmath1 have attracted wide attention because of their 2d structure , tunable carrier concentration , and the occurrence of sc @xcite .",
    "the co ions form a 2d triangular lattice , are in their low - spin state , and their valence ranges from co@xmath150 at @xmath151 to co@xmath152 at @xmath153 .",
    "charge carriers are @xmath154 holes on the co@xmath152 sites and the hole density @xmath155 .",
    "trigonal distortion splits the occupied @xmath156 orbitals into @xmath157 and @xmath158 orbitals .",
    "lda calculations have suggested that although for large @xmath63 the @xmath157 orbitals occur below the fermi level and an @xmath158-only description is valid , this description breaks down at small @xmath63 where @xmath157 orbitals can be nearly degenerate @xcite .",
    "in contrast , correlated - electron calculations find that the @xmath158 ",
    "@xmath157 energy separation is positive and relatively large for all @xmath63 @xcite , suggesting that low energy excitations can likely be described within @xmath158-only single - band models .",
