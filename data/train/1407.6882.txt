    "although astrophysical and cosmological evidences have established the existence of the dark matter ( dm ) , its nature has not been demystified ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "in particular , dm interactions with standard model ( sm ) particles have not been identified except for gravitational ones in spite of enormous experimental efforts .",
    "they have been limited by direct or indirect dm searches , for instance , by the lux experiment @xcite . besides",
    ", if the dm has sizable couplings with quarks or gluons , it can be discovered or constrained by collider experiments especially at the lhc @xcite .",
    "in fact , searching for the dm is one of the main targets for the next phase of the lhc .",
    "the collider searches are qualitatively different from the direct and indirect ones for the dm .",
    "the latter particularly depends on the relic abundance of the dm as well as its interactions . for a subcomponent of the dm ,",
    "the signal strength of direct or indirect searches can be suppressed , even if its coupling is strong .",
    "in contrast , signal strengths at colliders depend only on interactions . weakly - interacting massive particles ( wimps ) are searched , irrespective of whether they are dominant components of the dm .",
    "they are assumed to be stable and identified as a missing momentum in detectors .    in this letter",
    ", we study lhc signatures of stable wimps through the higgs portal , where they interact with the sm particles only via the higgs boson . they are assumed to be singlet under the sm gauge symmetries .",
    "an unbroken @xmath1 parity is introduced , where the stability of wimps is guaranteed by assigning odd ( even ) charge to wimp ( sm ) particles .",
    "we consider scalar , vector and anti - symmetric tensor fields as a candidate of higgs - portal wimps symmetry @xcite . ] .",
    "although the higgs - portal models have been constrained by lhc studies on the higgs invisible decay , they target wimps lighter than a half of the higgs boson mass@xcite . in this letter",
    ", we study lhc signatures of wimps when they are _",
    "heavier_. we explore the vector boson fusion ( vbf ) and @xmath0-boson associated production channels . besides",
    ", wimps are produced by gluon fusions via top loops and the intermediate higgs boson .",
    "such a channel can be identified by using associate productions of a hard jet .",
    "thus , we also investigate the mono - jet signature in light of the current lhc studies@xcite .",
    "it will be shown that the current lhc results constrain the higgs - portal interactions of the vector and tensor wimps to be less than 0.43 and 0.16 , respectively , while those for the scalar is very weak .",
    "prospects of the 14tev lhc will also be discussed .",
    "the remaining parts of this work are organized as follows .",
    "after introducing the higgs - portal models in section [ sec : model ] , the relevant lhc signatures and analysis details are described in section [ sec : signature ] .",
    "results for the 8tev lhc constraints are shown in section [ sec : limits ] , while section [ sec : prospects ] is devoted to discussions on prospects for the 14tev lhc .",
    "finally , our main conclusion are summarized in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "higgs - portal wimp models are considered , where wimp is a scalar , @xmath2 , vector , @xmath3 , or anti - symmetric tensor field , @xmath4 .",
    "it generally couples to the higgs boson via a dimension - four interaction operator .",
    "the lagrangian is generally given as    @xmath5    [ eq : model ]    where @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the mass parameter , quartic self - coupling and interaction strength between the higgs boson and wimp , respectively , for @xmath9 . in the lhc analysis , @xmath8 is set to be a real and positive value without loss of generality .",
    "also , @xmath10 is a field strength of the vector .",
    "after the electroweak symmetry is broken , the wimp mass receives a correction of @xmath11 . in the analysis ,",
    "the physical wimp mass is represented as @xmath12 . in this letter , we follow ref .",
    "@xcite for the tensor model , where a massive anti - symmetric two - form field is analyzed in the transverse representation as a candidate of the dm . in particular",
    ", the wave function becomes @xmath13 for momentum @xmath14 and helicity @xmath15 .",
    "the invisible decay rate of the higgs boson with a mass @xmath16 is calculated as    @xmath17    [ eq : width ]    where @xmath18 is the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field , @xmath19 .",
    "it is noticed that the vector and tensor productions are enhanced by @xmath20 , if @xmath16 is much larger than @xmath12 . for the vector final state , this comes from the longitudinal polarization . on the other hand , in the tensor case",
    "the wave function is proportional to @xmath21 but vanishes for @xmath22 , leading to the similar scaling behavior in high energy as the vector case .",
    "consequently , the higgs invisible decay rate becomes large especially for the vector and tensor wimps .",
    "in this section we discuss lhc signatures for the higgs - portal models described in the previous section .",
    "higgs invisible decay signals are definitive probes for the higgs - portal interactions . atlas and cms collaborations",
    "have put limits on the branching fraction of the higgs invisible decay ( @xmath23 ) based on vbf and @xmath24 associated production processes@xcite .",
    "those constraints can be reinterpreted for bounds on the heavy higgs - portal wimp models , where off - shell higgs bosons intermediate between the sm particles and wimps . besides",
    ", new physics searches via mono - jet @xcite , mono-@xmath0@xcite and mono-@xmath25@xcite signatures can also be a way to investigate higgs - portal models .    in the following ,",
    "we explain details of our vbf , mono - jet and mono-@xmath0 analyses for constraints on the heavy higgs - portal models . on the other hand ,",
    "since the currently available lhc results for the @xmath24@xcite and mono-@xmath25@xcite signatures are based on the template - based analyses ( i.e. , depending on kinematical distributions of decay products ) , it is not straightforward to reinterpret them for the constraints on the higgs - portal models .",
    "we do not investigate these channels in this study .",
    "we briefly explain the analysis details for vbf constraints on the higgs - portal models .",
    "wimp - pair productions are intermediated by the higgs boson , @xmath26 , as @xmath27 where the higgs is off - shell when the wimp is heavier than a half of the higgs boson mass .",
    "its cross section can be expressed as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the invariant mass squared of the @xmath30 system , and @xmath31mev is the total decay width of the higgs boson at the mass , @xmath32gev @xcite .",
    "the cross section consists of the following three parts : i ) the production cross section of the higgs boson , @xmath33 , at a hypothetical mass of the higgs boson , @xmath34 , ii ) the higgs boson propagator at the four momentum squared @xmath35 , and iii ) the decay width of the higgs boson into a pair of wimps , @xmath36 , provided in eq .  , where the higgs mass is supposed to be @xmath34 .",
    "it should be noted that the hypothetical higgs boson mass @xmath16 is not equal to the sm higgs boson mass @xmath37 .",
    "higgs production cross sections , @xmath33 , depend on higgs production processes , e.g. , higgs plus one jet , vbf and @xmath24 associated production , while the higgs propagator and @xmath36 are universal for all the production processes .",
    "thus , our main concern in evaluating a wimp - pair production cross section is the calculation of the corresponding higgs production cross section for various higgs masses .",
    "the cross section , @xmath33 , for the vbf process is calculated with the hawkv2.0 package@xcite at the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , including qcd and ew corrections .",
    "we impose the following kinematical cuts based on the cms vbf analysis@xcite : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the transverse momentum and pseudo - rapidity of the first ( second ) leading jet , respectively . also , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the rapidity difference , azimuthal - angle difference and invariant mass of the two leading jets , respectively .",
    "since the missing momentum arises solely from the higgs invisible decay in our simulation , the higgs transverse momentum , @xmath43 , is equal to the missing transverse momentum , @xmath44 .",
    "the cteq6l1 parton distribution function ( pdf ) set@xcite is used with the factorization / renormalization scale equal to @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the higgs @xmath47 cut .",
    "the following analysis is based on the parton level calculation , and effects of parton shower , hadronization and detector simulation are neglected . besides , we assume 100% trigger and reconstruction efficiencies , supported by their sufficiently high performance @xcite . also hawk is modified to implement the @xmath48 cut .",
    "the cms collaboration has reported that the observed 95% confidence level ( cl ) upper bound on @xmath23 is 0.65 for the sm higgs boson with @xmath32gev , where the upper bound on the signal event number is @xmath49 for the integrated luminosity ( @xmath50 ) of @xmath51 at @xmath52tev@xcite .",
    "if we require the vbf higgs production cross section times the invisible decay branching fraction , @xmath53 , to be smaller than the cms bound , @xmath54fb , we can reproduce the cms upper bound on @xmath23 as a function of the higgs mass ( fig .  8 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) within the @xmath55 level of the experimental uncertainty . our bound is stronger than that of cms .",
    "the difference may originate in theoretical uncertainties from pdf and factorization / renormalization scales as well as the effects of parton shower , hadronization and detector smearing including the trigger and reconstruction efficiencies , which are neglected in our analysis .",
    "the wimp production cross section , @xmath56 , is calculated from eqs .  .",
    "contributions of lower @xmath29 dominates the integration .",
    "the 95% cl upper bound on the higgs - portal coupling , @xmath57 , is obtained by requiring the expected event number from the wimp production process to be less than the cms limit on the signal excess , 137 events .",
    "next we explain the analysis details for the mono - jet constraints on the higgs - portal models .",
    "the wimp production process contributing to the mono - jet signal is @xmath58 where @xmath59 denotes an associated jet , and the intermediate higgs is off - shell when the wimp is heavier than a half of the higgs boson mass .    as in the vbf analysis in the previous subsection",
    ", the wimp - pair production cross section is expressed by eq .  . here",
    ", the higgs production cross section , @xmath33 , corresponds to that of the higgs plus one hard jet process at a hypothetical higgs mass , @xmath34 .",
    "the production proceeds mainly via top quark loops .",
    "when either the higgs boson mass or the jet transverse momentum exceeds twice the top quark mass , @xmath60 expansion of the top loop function breaks down , and the finite @xmath61 effects must be taken into account .",
    "this is the case when a higgs - portal wimp is heavy .",
    "the leading order ( lo ) cross section of the process has been evaluated with the finite top mass@xcite .",
    "however , the nlo cross section is known only in the infinite @xmath61 limit to the best of our knowledge .",
    "therefore , we take account of the finite @xmath61 effect at the lo level and include the nlo corrections approximately by a k - factor , defined as the ratio of the nlo and lo cross sections in the infinite @xmath61 limit as @xmath62 where the top quark mass is taken to be @xmath63 .",
    "this procedure should involve potentially large uncertainties mainly due to the breakdown of the infinite @xmath61 approximation .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to calculate finite @xmath61 corrections to the nlo cross section .",
    "the cms collaboration has reported the most severe limit on the mono - jet production cross section by using the @xmath51 dataset at @xmath64tev @xcite , while the atlas collaboration puts a weaker limit based on the @xmath65 dataset @xcite .",

    "are imposed on @xmath70 , whereas in the evaluation of the k - factor we take the @xmath43 cut as low as @xmath71 cut avoids large @xmath72 corrections ( see ref .",

    "the signal event number is 157 at 95% cl after imposing the cuts at @xmath64tev and @xmath76 @xcite .",

    "the vbf result puts about twice stronger bounds than the mono - jet ones , while the mono-@xmath0 bound is weaker than them .",
    "this is because the vbf signals are clean against backgrounds , while the cross section of the mono-@xmath0 productions is too small .",

    "the bounds becomes weaker for larger @xmath12 since the wimp production cross section is proportional to @xmath96 .",
