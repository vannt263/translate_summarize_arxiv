    "below when calculating diagrams we will always cast them in the same form , which would make all fundamental wilson lines vanish when we square the amplitude .",

    "the diagrams in represent the amplitude squared which contributes to the cross section : the solid vertical line denotes the final - state cut .",

    "note that diagram ( iii ) has two gluons in the final state : since we are calculating the single - inclusive production cross section , having more than the measured gluon in the final state is allowed .",
    "below we calculate the order-@xmath0 amplitude that enters diagram ( i ) in , thus constructing the order-@xmath3 correction to the amplitude in eq . which is enhanced by the leading power of @xmath40 .",
    "the order-@xmath81 amplitude from diagram ( ii ) is left for future work .",
    "the situation with the diagram ( iii ) is more subtle .",
    "first let us note that , since we are working in the classical mv model , the diagrams we consider for gluon production also correspond to the diagrams contributing to the classical gluon field with the two colliding nuclei providing the source current @xcite . hence one can think of these diagrams as graphically representing the solution of the yang ",
    "mills equations @xcite .",
    "in such case each feynman propagator would be replaced by the retarded green function .",
    "while such a replacement is relatively straightforward for gluon propagators , it is less clear what this prescription means for quark propagators in the time - ordered picture we employ here : for instance , the solution of yang ",
    "mills equations can only have the produced gluon emitted by the projectile quark _ after _",
    "the interaction with the shock wave ( see e.g. @xcite ) , whereas a naive application of perturbation theory allows one to draw a number of _ a priori _ non - zero graphs with the produced gluon emitted before the shock wave interaction ( see below ) .    to clarify this issue",
    "we need to perform a detailed diagrammatic analysis .",
    "first let us review how the gluon feynman propagators become retarded green functions .",
    "as an example consider the top two diagrams shown in where regular feynman propagators are implied for uncut lines .",
    "the difference between the top two diagrams in is due to one of the vertices involving the gluon carrying momentum @xmath87 being moved across the cut in the right diagram .",
    "the rest of the diagram is the same in both cases .",
    "concentrating on the propagator of the gluon carrying momentum @xmath87 and suppressing the rest of the diagrams contribution we see that adding the two graphs gives @xcite @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the numerator of the light - cone gauge gluon propagator with @xmath90 in the @xmath56 notation , such that @xmath91 is the gauge condition . for an on - shell ( @xmath92 ) gluon , the numerator of the gluon propagator in can be written as a sum over physical ( transverse ) gluon polarizations with the polarization 4-vector @xmath93 in the light - cone gauge and @xmath94 .",
    "( note that the last term on the right hand side of vanishes if @xmath95 . ) in arriving at we have also used the fact that the quark - gluon vertex changes sign when carried across the cut due to complex conjugation .    from we",
    "conclude that contributions of top two diagrams in can be found by only calculating the left diagram with the retarded gluon green function : this conclusion is illustrated in the bottom diagram in , with the retarded gluon green function denoted by a bold arrow on the gluon line .",
    "note also that the retarded green function arising in implies that @xmath96 in the notation shown in , such that the gluon is first emitted by the quark line , and then it enters the triple gluon vertex leading to the production of the measured gluon .",
    "the arrow in the last diagram of indicates this direction of time flow .",
    "so far we have considered an example of just two diagrams which combine to give us a retarded gluon green function .",
    "however , the statement that by moving an end of a gluon line across the cut and by adding that contribution to the original diagram we would obtain a retarded green function for that gluon is valid in general , at this classical level . to demonstrate this",
    "explicitly we need to consider many different types of diagrams : this is done in appendix  [ a ] .",
    "note also that our ability to use a retarded gluon green function in calculating the amplitude should not depend on what goes on in the complex conjugate amplitude : while naively our argument in seems to depend on the absence of final - state ( post - shock wave ) interactions in the complex conjugate amplitude , the argument is in fact true in general , as long as we are working at the classical level , that is , calculating order-@xmath86 cross - section contribution involving two interacting projectile nucleons ( quarks ) .",
    "we refer the reader to appendix  [ a ] for details .",
    "the diagram in the top left panel of is in the ( i)-class by the classification presented in , while the diagram in the top right panel of is in the ( iii)-class . we see that the contribution of the type-(iii ) diagram is included in the type-(i ) diagram by using a retarded gluon propagator in the latter .",
    "again this conclusion is true in general : type-(iii ) diagrams are included in the calculation of type-(i ) and type-(ii ) diagrams if we use retarded gluon propagators .",
    "now let us consider diagrams where the projectile quarks exchange a gluon with each other ( the gluon may or may not go through the shock wave ) .",
    "an example of several such diagrams is given in , where graphs labeled ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are different from each other only by the placement of the gluon exchanged between the projectile quarks .",
    "once again , the arrow on this gluon line denotes a retarded gluon green function , with the direction of the arrow indicating the direction of the resulting ( light - cone ) time ordering .",
    "we see that each diagram in represents a sum of two diagrams ( akin to ): each graph of implies a sum of itself ( with the feynman gluon propagator for the gluon with the arrow on it ) and the contribution where the lower quark - gluon vertex of the same gluon is carried across the cut ( to the region before the shock wave interaction in the complex conjugate amplitude ) , resulting in the retarded green function for the gluon marked by an arrow .",
    "note that the time - ordering of the retarded green function for the gluon in the graph of again points towards the produced gluon , similar to the case illustrated in .    to analyze the diagrams in we need the following additional observation :",
    "moving a retarded gluon green function across the cut flips the sign of the contribution .",
    "this is illustrated by a simple example in ( see appendix  [ a ] for more details ) , where the cancellation is valid independent of the interactions which may happen after the shock wave interaction ( i.e. , for @xmath97 shown by the shaded region in ) on both sides of the cut .",
    "employing the cancellation of , we see that diagram ( 1 ) in is canceled by the contribution to diagram ( 3 ) coming from the @xmath96 region , @xmath98 due to the difference in color factors , such cancellation does not happen between the diagram ( 2 ) in and the diagram ( 3 ) with @xmath99 : instead , if we write the contribution of diagram ( 2 ) factoring out the color factor as @xmath100 , we get @xmath101 \\ , m = ( 2 ) \\ \\mbox{with } \\    [ t^a , t^b].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this conclusion is illustrated in the lower right diagram of : the sum of diagrams ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) is simply diagram ( 2 ) with the commutator instead of the product of the fundamental generators in the amplitude . once again , while we have illustrated the point by a simple example , it is valid in all cases : contributions of diagrams with the single or double gluon exchange between the two valence quarks can all be found by simply calculating a small subset of those graphs replacing products of @xmath64 s in them by commutators .",
    "the details of how this happens and which diagrams survive in the end are given in appendix  [ a ] .",
    "at order-@xmath0 the surviving diagrams are @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 from below ( indeed diagram @xmath102 is the amplitude to the left of the cut in the graph ( 2 ) of ) , which have to be calculated with the commutators instead of the products of fundamental generators . as we will see below , @xmath105 ( even with the commutator ) , such that only produced gluon emissions by projectile quarks after the shock wave interaction , that is for @xmath97 , survive",
    "this observation completes the analogy between the feynman diagrams in the shock wave formalism and the diagrams representing the classical gluon fields in the mv model .",
    "we would like to stress that to establish this diagrams versus classical fields analogy , and simplify our calculations in the process , we had to utilize the fact that the amplitude we are calculating would have to be squared to obtain the cross section .",
    "hence we have absorbed some contributions from the complex conjugate amplitude into our amplitude by employing the retarded green functions and , for some graphs , commutators .",
    "therefore , strictly - speaking , below we will not be calculating a standard feynman - diagram amplitude , but a somewhat modified amplitude with retarded `` propagators '' and commutators : the square of this amplitude would still give the gluon production cross section .",
    "let us summarize the main conclusions of this section .",
    "first of all , to find the first saturation correction in the projectile , we only need to calculate @xmath41 and @xmath43 gluon production amplitudes with the retarded gluon green functions .",
    "the time - ordering of the retarded `` propagators '' should be such that the gluon would be emitted first , and then would participate in an interaction ultimately leading to the production of the tagged gluon .",
    "secondly , the contributions of the diagrams with the gluon exchanges between the projectile nucleons ( quarks ) can be more economically constructed by calculating a subset of those graph with the commutators of fundamental color matrices .",
    "the diagrams contributing to the gluon production amplitude at @xmath106 that include interactions with both nucleons are shown in figs .",
    "[ agraphs ] and [ bgraphs ] .",
    "the diagrams from are labeled @xmath107 with @xmath108 and will be referred to as the @xmath109-graphs . similarly the graphs in are labeled @xmath110 with @xmath111 and will be called the @xmath112-graphs .",
    "in addition to all the @xmath112-graphs one has to consider the diagrams similar to those in but with the two projectile quarks interchanged : these will be labeled @xmath113 with @xmath111 and referred to as @xmath114-graphs .    to calculate the diagrams in figs .  [ agraphs ] and [ bgraphs ] we will follow the rules established in the previous section .",
    "all gluon propagators are retarded , such that time flows towards the measured gluon in the diagram .",
    "this means that the retarded propagator for the gluon exchanged between the two quarks in is such that the lower quark - gluon vertex comes earlier than the upper one .",
    "the projectile quark lines are normalizes as wilson lines ( that is , each line is divided by @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the large `` @xmath117 '' momentum in the line ) .    our ultimate goal is to obtain an amplitude in coordinate space , in a form similar to .",
    "the reason for that is the relative ease with which the correlators of wilson lines are calculated in the transverse coordinate space , particularly in the mv model . for the diagrams in figs .",
    "[ agraphs ] and [ bgraphs ] we would have to perform fourier transforms into transverse coordinate space , similar to the transition from to above .",
    "our standard notation will be to label the projectile quarks @xmath85 and @xmath118 , such that their transverse positions are @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "note also that _ a priori _ the two quarks in the @xmath51-direction moving projectile have different @xmath52 positions , labeled here as @xmath121 and @xmath122 ( see diagram @xmath4 in ) .",
    "since the projectile is also a large nucleus , the difference @xmath123 , while suppressed by a power of energy , is enhanced by a power of the projectile atomic number @xmath4 @xcite : in the following we will keep the difference @xmath123 non - zero throughout the calculation while remembering that it is sub - eikonally small , and will put it to zero at the end of the calculation where allowed . the difference",
    "@xmath123 will serve as a regulator in the longitudinal fourier transform .",
    "this is in accordance to the standard regularization of singularities in the mv model @xcite .    to obtain an amplitude dependent on @xmath121 and @xmath122 we need to perform a longitudinal fourier",
    "transform integrating over the `` @xmath117 '' component of the momentum exchanged between the projectile quarks in the diagrams of figs .",
    "[ agraphs ] and [ bgraphs ] .",
    "since we are working in the @xmath53 light - cone gauge with the numerator of the gluon propagator given in , we have to specify the regularization of the light - cone poles at @xmath124 in order to perform this longitudinal fourier transform .",
    "each way of regulating the light - cone pole is equivalent to specifying a particular sub - gauge within the light - cone gauge . in our calculation",
    "we will use the principal value ( pv ) prescription , where @xmath125 \\ , \\mbox{pv } \\left ( \\frac{1}{l^+ } \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath126.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the pv prescription corresponds to the field of the projectile nucleus moving in the @xmath51 direction satisfying the @xmath127 sub - gauge condition ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "other possible sub - gauge choices include requiring that the field of the projectile nucleus obeys the @xmath128 condition @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to @xcite @xmath129 if the momentum @xmath87 flows from the index @xmath130 to the index @xmath131 along the gluon line .",
    "the corresponding polarization 4-vector is @xmath132 one may also employ the @xmath133 sub - gauge condition , which results in reversing the sign of @xmath134 in eqs .   and .",
    "the reason we are going to use the pv sub - gauge is explained in detail in appendix  [ b ] .",
    "it turns out that while the @xmath135 and @xmath133 sub - gauges are very useful for many classical gluon field calculations @xcite , in our shock - wave target setup the pv prescription is more economical .",
    "namely , as detailed in appendix  [ b ] , using the @xmath136 or @xmath137 gauge choices leads to the need to include new diagrams , which are not included in figs .",
    "[ agraphs ] and [ bgraphs ] ( and are not part of the @xmath114-graphs ) .",
    "see for instance the first two diagrams in of appendix  [ b ] .",
    "these diagrams were considered before in @xcite . in the shock - wave formalism these diagrams are probably classified as higher - order corrections to the interactions with the shock wave : namely , if one takes the leading - order gluon production diagrams from , and considers an order-@xmath3 correction to the interactions of either the quark or the gluon with the shock wave , one would then obtain an order-@xmath0 contribution to the gluon production amplitude .",
    "indeed such corrections are not going to be enhanced by an extra @xmath40 ( in the cross section ) : however , shock wave interaction corrections to the lowest - order graphs from involving a quark from another projectile nucleon would give an order-@xmath0 contribution enhanced by a power of @xmath4 , that is , they would be comparable to the @xmath109 , @xmath112 and @xmath114 graphs . in appendix  [ b ] we show that while in the @xmath138 and @xmath139 sub - gauges such diagrams are important , most of their contributions are zero in the pv sub - gauge .",
    "the remaining shock wave corrections contributions which are non - zero in the pv sub - gauge cancel in the amplitude squared , and , hence , can also be neglected in the calculation .",
    "we will therefore proceed by calculating the fourier transform for all diagrams using the pv sub - gauge of the light - cone gauge .",
    "we performed all diagram calculations treating the projectile quark lines both as the regular high - energy quarks and as the light - cone wilson lines from ( only with non - zero @xmath140 ) . in the pv sub - gauge",
    "both results are identically equal . however , in the @xmath136 and @xmath137 sub - gauges we found that the wilson - line approximation does not give the right answer for the @xmath112 and @xmath114 graphs . for more details",
    "we refer the reader to appendix  [ b ] .      since presenting a detailed calculation of each diagram is rather tedious , and would make the paper difficult to read , we will first work out one sample diagram , and then state the answers for the rest of the graphs .",

    "hence , strictly - speaking , we have not shown that our result in ( with primed sums ) is gauge - invariant : while it may still be gauge - invariant , at the moment we can think of it as a gauge - invariant amplitude ( resulting from the unprimed sums ) with the terms added ( in the pv sub - gauge ) casting it in a simpler form for obtaining the gluon production cross section .",

    "[ a ]    the purpose of this appendix is to show that ( a ) the inclusion of the type-(iii ) diagrams from into the calculation can be easily accomplished by using retarded gluon green functions instead of feynman propagators ; and that ( b ) the contributions of @xmath112 and @xmath114 graphs ( shown in ) to the @xmath41 amplitude along with the contributions of similar diagrams to the @xmath206 amplitude can all be efficiently found by calculating a subset of those graphs with color - commutators instead of the usual fundamental color factors . while these statements appear unrelated , they seem to be hard to disentangle for the @xmath112 and @xmath114 types of graphs .",
    "let us begin with contributions to the cross section coming from the squares of the @xmath109-graphs ( defined in ) .",
    "it is straightforward to see by an explicit diagram analysis that the argument depicted in applies in general , for the amplitude and the complex conjugate amplitude contributions coming from any two @xmath109-graphs .",
    "we illustrate this point in by considering a slightly more involved example than that shown in , namely by studying the square of diagram @xmath4 .",
    "the argument of applies here as well , after the following two observations .",

    "the first square brackets in each of eqs .   and",
    "contain a single @xmath368-channel gluon exchange corresponding to the classical field of the target quark .",
    "the second pair of square brackets in eqs .   and contain the `` gauge rotation '' illustrated by the dashed line in using the notation defined in and .",
    "the arrow at the end of the dashed line indicates a commutator of fundamental color matrices for the dashed line `` gluon '' and for the `` true '' gluon entering the quark - gluon vertex : the first term in the commutator contains the color matrix for the dashed line placed to the left of the color matrix of the `` true '' gluon .    to figure out how corrections from the diagrams @xmath373 and @xmath374 contribute to the amplitude with multiple rescatterings we need to add up all possible gauge rotations for multiple interactions with the target nucleons .",
    "the case of the two projectile quarks scattering on two target nucleons is shown in .",
    "on the left of the equality in we have shown two contributions arising due to the corrections like those shown in the right two diagrams of : one for the first nucleons and one for the second nucleon . analyzing the sum on the left",
    "we see that the gauge rotations inside the shock wave cancel out and we only end up with rotations on the outside of the charge distribution .",
    "the final result on the right of gives an order-@xmath84 correction to the shock waves with the dashed line without an arrow defined as in and . repeating this argument for any number of target nucleons , by including both corrections from the right two diagrams of for each nucleon",
    ", we arrive at the same conclusion : the net result of all such corrections is equal to a diagram with a dashed line to the right of the shock wave minus the diagram with the dashed line to the left of the shock wave .",
    "we see that in the sub - gauge of interest each shock wave interaction is accompanied by the order-@xmath84 corrections as shown in .",
    "the dashed line contributions are given by the expression in the parenthesis of , since all the @xmath51 coordinates are integrated out in going from @xmath373 and @xmath374 in to the contribution to the scattering amplitude .",
    "using this result it is straightforward to deduce the contributions of gauge rotations to the gluon production amplitude .",
    "one simply has to take an order-@xmath82 gluon production amplitude for the scattering of two projectile quarks on the target and add all possible dashed lines to it ( connecting a pair of @xmath186-channel lines ) immediately to the left and to the right of the shock wave ( with the appropriate signs ) .",
    "the resulting corrections to the single gluon production amplitude are depicted in below under the category ( ii ) : they are labeled @xmath375 .",
    "the last contributions we have to consider are the gauge dependent parts of the @xmath109 , @xmath187 and @xmath188 diagrams . calculating these is straightforward although time - consuming , just repeating the calculation done in the main text of the paper but this time including the part of the gluon propagators proportional to @xmath290 ( see ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that for an `` instantaneous '' term such as this , it does not matter whether one uses feynman propagators or retarded gluon green functions : hence our demonstration of the sub - gauge invariance also applies if one uses retarded gluon green functions , as is done in the main text .    with this in mind all of the gauge - dependent terms of diagrams @xmath109 and @xmath188 ( corresponding to a gluon emission from quark @xmath85 )",
    "are shown in and are labeled @xmath291 and @xmath376 .",
    "these terms were obtained by an explicit calculation .",
    "note that @xmath377 , with the same definition for @xmath378 .",
    "also shown in are `` pinched '' contributions @xmath379 .",
    "note that in the labels @xmath291 , @xmath380 , @xmath375 , and @xmath376 include both the diagram above each of them and the sign in front of the diagram .",
    "all of the gauge - dependent contributions to feynman diagrams at the order @xmath0 shown in , that is , the `` pinched '' contributions , shock wave corrections , and gauge - dependent diagram corrections cancel out , preserving gauge invariance .",
    "more precisely we have @xmath381 hence our result ( the sum of all the @xmath109 , @xmath112 and @xmath114 graphs and the sum of all the @xmath187 and @xmath188 graphs ) is independent of the choice of sub - gauge in the light - cone gauge .",
