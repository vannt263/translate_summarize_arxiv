    "the _ probabilistic truth table task _ was introduced by two independent studies at the beginning of this millennium @xcite .",
    "it can be seen as one of the starting points of the new ( probability - based ) paradigm psychology of reasoning , which started to replace the the old ( classical logic - based ) paradigm psychology of reasoning .",
    "the probabilistic truth table task was constructed to investigate how people interpret conditionals ( i.e. , indicative sentences of the form _ if @xmath1 , then @xmath2 _ ) .",
    "as its name suggests , the task consists in inferring the degree of belief in a conditional based on probabilistic information attached to the truth table cases .",
    "what are truth table cases ?",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote two propositions ( i.e. , sentences for which it makes sense to assign the truth values _ true _ or _ false _ ) like _ a fair die is rolled _ and _ the side of the die shows an even number _",
    ", respectively .",
    "the four truth table cases induced by @xmath1 and @xmath2 are : @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , where @xmath7 denotes conjunction ( `` and '' ) and @xmath8 denotes negation .",
    "classical logic is bivalent , involving only the truth values _ true _ and _ false_. therefore , the conditional defined in classical logic ( i.e. , the _ material conditional _ , see table  [ tab : ttables ] ) is either true or false .",
    "the _ conditional event _",
    "@xmath9 involved in conditional probability ( @xmath10 ) , however , is not bivalent , as it is _ void _ ( or undetermined ) if its antecedent @xmath1 is false ( see table  [ tab : ttables ] ) .",
    "therefore , it can not be represented by the means of classical logic .",
    "table  [ tab : ttables ] presents the truth conditions of the most important psychological interpretations for adult reasoning about indicative conditionals ( i.e. , conditional event , conjunction , and material conditional ) .",
    "moreover , it presents the biconditional and biconditional event interpretations , which were reported in developmental psychological studies .    psychological evidence for the conditional event interpretation",
    "was already observed within the old paradigm psychology of reasoning .",
    "the response pattern , which is consistent with the conditional event interpretation was seen as irrational ( dubbed `` defective truth table '' ) , as it violates the semantics of the material conditional .",
    "the material conditional used to be the gold standard of reference for the meaning of indicative conditionals in the old paradigm . however , within the new paradigm psychology of reasoning this response pattern is , of course , perfectly rational @xcite .",
    "0.12 in    .truth tables for the material conditional @xmath11 , the conjunction @xmath12 , the biconditional @xmath13 , the biconditional event @xmath14 ( i.e. , @xmath15 ) , and the conditional event @xmath9 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     . ]",
    "the task material was designed such that the normative predictions of the three main psychological interpretations of conditionals ( i.e. , conditional probability , conjunction , and material conditional ) were unique for each task . during the analysis we identified three further response strategies related to the conditional probability interpretation . in what we call",
    "_ halfway lower _",
    "interpretation ( denoted by @xmath16 ) the upper bound is the same as in conditional probability , but the lower bound response differs in that the covered sides ( i.e. , sides marked with question mark ) are ignored .",
    "_ halfway upper _ interpretation ( denoted by @xmath17 ) is the same , but in reverse order . in a _ halfway both _",
    "interpretation the covered sides are ignored for both bound responses . as",
    "these answer strategies are in a sense partial versions of the conditional probability interpretation , we combined their results with conditional probability answers into _ grouped conditional probability_. notice that the tasks t1,t2 , t10 and t11 with full information ( i.e. , no question marks )",
    "have the same value for lower and upper bound answers . therefore the halfway responses could not be distinguished from the conditional probability answers in these tasks .",
    "of all 1440 responses , 32.1% were consistent with conditional event responses , 29.9% were consistent with conjunction responses , and 0.2% were consistent with material conditional responses . like the material conditional , also the biconditional and the biconditional event response frequencies play a neglectable rle in the data ( 0%3% in the four tasks t3 , t6 , t12 , t15 where these interpretations were differentiated ) .",
    "the predominant response strategy in point - valued tasks ( t1 , t2 , t10 and t11 ) was consistent with the conditional probability interpretation . in nine out of 14 tasks with incomplete probabilistic information ( i.e. , tasks involving `` covered '' sides or patient reports ) the predominant answer strategy was conjunction .",
    "we also observed shifts of interpretation towards conditional probability : comparing the first three tasks with incomplete information ( i.e. , t3t5 ) to the last three ( i.e. , t16t18 ) , the number of conditional probability answers increased from 19% to 30% , and conjunction answers decreased from 35% to 27% .",
    "this replicates shifts of interpretations reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "however , when all the conditional probability response types are grouped together , the resulting set of response strategies is clearly the predominant one in all tasks .",
    "51.5% of all answers are consistent with the grouped conditional probability responses .",
    "18.1% were `` other '' responses , that is , responses that did not fit the grouped conditional probability , conjunction , biconditional , biconditional event , or material conditional .",
    "thus , in total 81.9% of the data can be modeled by the investigated hypotheses concerning the interpretation of conditionals .",
    "compared to a previous study that investigated non - causal indicative conditionals under incomplete probabilistic information ( * ? ? ?",
    "* i.e. , similar tasks as in condition c1 ) , our results show lower level of conditional event responses ( compared to the previous 65.6% ) , and higher levels of conjunction responses ( compared to the previous 5.6% ) .",
    "the material conditional responses were similar ( previously 0.3% ) .",
    "investigated conditionals under complete probabilistic knowledge and used similar tasks as in our conditions c1 , c2 and c3 .",
    "these authors also reported higher levels of conditional probability answers and lower levels of conjunction responses , while material conditional responses were similarly low .",
    "the lower levels of conditional probability responses may be explained by the apparent higher complexity of the tasks used in the present experiment .",
    "the tasks are more complex ( i ) because of the combination of using counterfactuals as target sentences in three of four conditions and ( ii ) because of imprecise probabilities in the premises ( i.e. , incomplete probabilistic information ) .",
    "the tendency to give answers that partially coincide with conditional probability has also been found in a previous study which tested non - causal cases in indicative mood with similar task material as we used for condition c1 @xcite . in that study our halfway lower - interpretation",
    "is referred to as `` halfway conditional event strategy '' . however , in the present study we found two completely new strategies : the halfway upper- and the halfway both - interpretation .",
    "the halfway upper - interpretation is particularly interesting , as it explains 12.8% of the total 1120 responses , slightly more than the halfway lower response strategy ( i.e. , 11.6% ) .",
    "halfway conditional probability responses might unburden the working memory load by ignoring the covered sides .",
    "figure  [ fig : confidence ] shows the results of the confidence ratings .",
    "we performed analyses of variance to investigate impacts of the different conditions .",
    "after holm - bonferroni corrections we observed significant differences within the three tasks t1 , t2 and t10 .",
    "the corresponding p - values were 0.006 , 0.01 , and 0.008 .",
    "in each of these tasks  as well as in all other tasks  the condition c4 had lower mean confidence values compared to the other conditions .",
    "the lower confidence may be because of the apparent higher difficulty of the task material in condition c4 for two reasons : first , the target sentence was a counterfactual . because of the inconsistency between the factual statement and the antecedent , many participants reported counterfactuals as puzzling in the post - test interview .",
    "second , abductive tasks required `` backward '' inference from effects to causes and are incongruent with the more natural _ if cause , then effect_-direction . in general ,",
    "backward inferences are known to be harder to draw compared to forward inferences @xcite .",
    "we investigated how people reason about conditionals under incomplete probabilistic knowledge .",
    "the novel features in our test design were comparisons of _ causal _ and _ abductive _ scenarios , as well as _ counterfactuals _ under _ incomplete _ probabilistic knowledge . one of our main findings is that the dominant response is consistent with the conditional event interpretation of conditionals among all four groups .",
    "moreover , we discovered two major answer strategies , _ halfway upper _ and _ halfway lower conditional event responses _ , which can be understood as strategies to unburden the working memory load .",
    "inferentialist accounts of conditionals propose that there should be an inferential relation between the antecedent and the consequent .",
    "thus , when conditionals with inferential relations ( e.g. , causal or abductive ones ) are compared with conditionals where no apparent inferential relation exists ( like in our conditions c1 and c2 ) , one would expect significant differences .",
    "our data , however , do not support this inferentialist hypothesis .",
    "the results of our paper broaden the area of inferences where conditional probability seems to be the best predictor for how people reason .",
    "we have shown that coherence - based probability logic provides a formalization of the meaning of counterfactuals and provides a rationality framework for reasoning under complete and incomplete probabilistic knowledge .",
    "this suggests that it may also be suitable for subclasses of causal reasoning like abductive reasoning , which is important in the studies on ( scientific ) explanation and learning ."
