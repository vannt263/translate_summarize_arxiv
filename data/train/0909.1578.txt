    "since einstein s formulation of special relativity in 1905 , the most important development in physics is the formulation of quantum mechanics resulting in heisenberg s uncertainty principle .    for solving practical problems , the schrdinger wave equation is commonly used . for scattering problems , we use running - wave solutions . for bound states ,",
    "we obtain standing - wave solutions with their boundary conditions .",
    "indeed , this localization boundary condition leads to discrete energy levels .    for scattering problems",
    ", we now have lorentz - covariant quantum field theory with its scattering matrix formalism and feynman diagrams . since quantum field theory was so successful that there had been attempts in the past to understand bound - state problems using the s matrix method .",
    "however , it was noted from the calculation of the neutron - proton mass difference from dashen and frautchi that the s - matrix method does not guarantee the localization of the bound - state wave functions  @xcite .    while the localization boundary condition is the main problem for the bound state",
    ", the question is whether this issue is covariant under lorentz transformations .",
    "we know the hydrogen has its localized wave function , but how would this appear to the observer on a train ?",
    "one way to reduce this difficulty is to study harmonic oscillators , because the oscillator system has its built - in boundary condition . for this reason",
    ", there had been many attempts in the past to make the harmonic oscillator lorentz - covariant .    in order to understand the hadronic mass spectra and hadronic transition rates in the quark model , feynman _",
    "et al . _ in 1971 published a paper containing the following lorentz - invariant differential equation  @xcite .",
    "@xmath0   + \\frac{1}{16}\\left(x^a_{\\mu } -x^b_{\\mu}\\right)^2 + m_0 ^ 2\\right\\ } \\phi\\left(x^a_{\\mu } , x^b_{\\mu}\\right ) = 0 , \\ ] ]    for a hadron consisting of two quarks bound - together harmonic oscillator potential .",
    "the space - time quark coordinates are @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "they then wrote down the equation    they wrote down the hadronic and quark separation coordinates as @xmath3 & { } & x_\\mu = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}\\left(x^a_{\\mu } - x^b_{\\mu}\\right ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively , and @xmath4 as @xmath5 then the differential equation can be separated into the following two equations .",
    "@xmath6 for the hadronic coordinate , and @xmath7 for the coordinate of quark separation inside the hadron .    the differential equation of eq.([diff22 ] )",
    "is a klein - gordon equation for the hadronic coordinate .",
    "the klein - gordon equation is lorentz - invariant and is the starting point for quantum field theory for scattering processes with feynman diagrams .",
    "this aspect of physics is well known . in the present case",
    ", the solution takes the form @xmath8 with @xmath9 we are using here the space - favored metric where @xmath10 . the hadronic mass is thus determined from @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath12 parameter is determined from the oscillator equation of eq.([diff33 ] ) for the internal space - time coordinate .",
    "the internal quark motion determined the hadronic mass , according to feynman _",
    "et al . _",
    "indeed , the differential equation of eq.([diff11 ] ) contains the scattering - state equation for the hadron , and the bound - state equation for the quarks inside the hadron .",
    "the differential equation of eq.([diff33 ] ) is also a lorentz - invariant equation .",
    "the problem is that the set of solutions given by feynman _ et al . _ in their 1971 paper is not consistent with the existing rules of physics .",
    "this is the reason why this paper is not well known .",
    "however , this does not exclude other sets of solutions .",
    "the solutions can take different forms depending on the separable coordinate systems with their boundary conditions .",
    "indeed , there is a set of oscillator solution that can constitute a representation of the poincar group , particularly that of wigner s little group which dictates the internal space - time symmetry of the particles in the lorentz - covariant world  @xcite . we choose to call this set of solutions the poincar set .    if we ignore the time - like variable in eq.([diff33 ] ) , it is the schrdinger - type equation for the three - dimensional harmonic oscillator . if we ignore it , the equation loses its lorentz invariance . the problem is how to deal with the time - separation variable , while it is not even mentioned in the present form of quantum mechanics .",
    "if we believe in einstein , this variable exists wherever there is a spacial separation like the bohr radius .",
    "however , we pretend know about it in the present form of quantum mechanics .    in this report , we give an interpretation to this variable based on the lessons we learn from quantum optics . for this purpose , we show first that the poincar set for the covariant harmonic oscillator can be used for mathematical basis for two - photon coherent states or squeezed states  @xcite .",
    "in other words , the squeezed states can be constructed from the lorentz - invariant differential equation of eq.([diff33 ] ) .",
    "we then establish that the longitudinal and time - like excitations in the covariant harmonic oscillator system can be translated into the two - photon coherent state .",
    "we know what happens when one of the two photons is not observed .",
    "the result is an increase in entropy  @xcite .",
    "we can then go back to the covariant oscillator and give a similar interpretation to the time - separation variable which is not observed in the present form of quantum mechanics ,    in sec .",
    "[ lorentz ] , we introduce the set of solutions of eq.([diff33 ] ) which constitutes a representation of the poincargroup .",
    "we then study the space - time geometry of its lorentz covariance . in sec .",
    "[ sqz ] , it is shown that the oscillator differential equation of eq.([diff33 ] ) can serve as the starting equation for squeezed states in quantum optics , and also that this poincar set serves as the mathematical basis for the two - photon coherent state . in sec .",
    "[ restof ] , we give a physical interpretation to the time - separation variable in terms of feynman s rest of the universe , which has a concrete physical interpretation in quantum optics .",
    "in 1979 , kim , noz , and oh published a paper on representations of the poincar group using a set of solutions of the oscillator equation of eq.([diff33 ] )  @xcite . later in 1986 , kim and noz in their book  @xcite noted that this set corresponds to a representation of wigner s @xmath13-like little group for massive particles .",
    "if a particle has a non - zero mass , there is a lorentz frame in which the particle is at rest .",
    "wigner s little group then becomes that of the three - dimensional rotation group , which is very familiar to us .",
    "the lorentz - covariant solution of the lorentz - invariant differential equation contains both space - like and time - like wave components , but we can keep the time - like component to its ground state . the wave function",
    "thus retains the @xmath13-like symmetry .",
    "the solution takes the form @xmath14    as for the spatial part of the differential equation , it is the equation for the three - dimensional oscillator .",
    "we can solve this equation with both the cartesian and spherical coordinate systems .",
    "if we use the spherical system with @xmath15 as the variables , the solution should take the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the spherical harmonics , and @xmath18 is the normalized radial wave function with @xmath19 the @xmath12 and @xmath20 parameters specify the mass and the internal spin of the hadron respectively , as required by wigner s representation theory  @xcite .",
    "if we use the cartesian coordinate systems , and the solution can be written as    @xmath21^{1/2 }             h_a(x ) h_b(y ) h_n(z )    \\exp{\\left\\{-\\left(\\frac{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}{2}\\right)\\right\\ } } , \\ ] ]    where @xmath22 is the hermite polynomial of @xmath23 . since the three - dimensional oscillator system is separable in both the spherical and cartesian coordinate systems , the wave function of eq.([sol22 ] ) can be written as a linear combination of the solutions given in eq.([sol33 ] ) , with @xmath24    when we boost this solution along the @xmath23 direction , the cartesian form of eq.([sol33 ] ) is more convenient .",
    "since the transverse @xmath25 and @xmath26 coordinates are not affected by this transformation , we can separate out these variables in the oscillator differential equation of eq.([diff33 ] ) , and consider the differential equation @xmath27   -\\left[-\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\right)^2 +   t^2\\right]\\right\\}\\psi(z , t ) = n \\psi(z , t ) .\\ ] ]    this differential equation remains invariant under the lorentz boost @xmath28 & { } & t \\rightarrow ( \\sinh\\eta)z + ( \\cosh\\eta)t .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the velocity parameter @xmath31 .",

    "<S> their starting point was a lorentz - invariant differential equation . </S>",
    "<S> this equation can be separated into a klein - gordon equation for the free - moving hadron and a harmonic oscillator equation for the quarks inside the hadron . </S>",
    "<S> however , their solution of the oscillator equation is not consistent with the existing rules of quantum mechanics and special relativity . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> their partial differential equation has many other solutions depending on boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> it is noted that there is a lorentz - covariant set of solutions totally consistent with quantum mechanics and special relativity . </S>",
    "<S> this set constitutes a representation of the poincar group which dictates the fundamental space - time symmetry of particles in the lorentz - covariant world . </S>",
    "<S> it is then shown that the same set of solutions can be used as the mathematical basis for two - photon coherent states or squeezed states in quantum optics . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus possible to transmit the physics of squeezed states into the hadronic world . </S>",
    "<S> while the time - like separation is the most puzzling problem in the covariant oscillator regime , this variable can be interpreted like the unobserved photon in the two - mode squeezed state which leads to an entropy increase . </S>"
