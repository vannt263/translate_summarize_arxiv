    "recent observations of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies give strong evidence that primordial density fluctuations are almost gaussian , scale - invariant , and adiabatic @xcite . during inflation ,",
    "they are generated as vacuum fluctuations of light fields and are stretched to cosmological scales to explain the large scale structure of the universe @xcite .",
    "such a light field responsible for density fluctuations has been considered to be the inflaton itself for a long time .",
    "recently , alternative candidates for such a light field have been proposed .",
    "one attractive example is the curvaton @xcite , which is effectively massless and acquires fluctuations during inflation .",
    "after inflation , it becomes effectively massive and contributes to a non - negligible fraction of the energy density of the universe .",
    "then , after it decays , eventually density fluctuations induced by the curvaton are converted to adiabatic ones and can dominate over those generated by the inflaton itself . another interesting candidate is a light field whose expectation value determines the coupling constant of the inflaton to standard model particles @xcite . such a light field will fluctuate during inflation , which leads to fluctuation of the decay rate of the inflaton .",
    "then , this latter spatial fluctuation induces that of the reheating temperature , which eventually generates curvature perturbations .",
    "some variants of these two alternative candidates have also been considered related to the fluctuations of masses and annihilation cross sections @xcite , and the preheating mechanism @xcite .    in order to determine",
    "which light field is actually responsible for primordial density fluctuations , the deviation from gaussianity of the curvature perturbations is of great use .",
    "if density fluctuations are completely gaussian , their bispectra , characterized by a parameter @xmath3 , and ( connected ) trispectra , characterized by parameters @xmath2 and @xmath4 vanish .",
    "therefore , estimation of the bispectra and trispectra is important to identify the light field . in @xcite , it was shown that the bispectrum is significantly suppressed by the slow - roll parameters up to an undetectable level in a single field slow - roll inflation model . @xcite . ] after @xcite , the trispectrum , as well as bispectrum , were evaluated in a multi - field configuration and a curvaton scenario . though spectra are still suppressed by slow - roll parameters in a multi - field configuration @xcite , they can be significantly large in the curvaton scenario @xcite . on the contrary , only the bispectrum is calculated in the modulated reheating scenario @xcite . since the bispectrum can be large in both the curvaton scenario and the modulated reheating scenario , trispectrum may be useful to discriminate between them .",
    "though the present constraint on the trispectrum is not particularly severe , and is roughly given by @xmath5 @xcite , a value of @xmath6 will be detectable by the planck satellite @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of our paper is to estimate the trispectrum in the modulated reheating scenario .",
    "we use the @xmath0 formalism , which is a powerful approach to evaluate the non - gaussianity of curvature perturbations simply because it requires a homogeneous background solution @xcite .",
    "then , we use the same formalism to evaluate the trispectrum of curvature perturbations as well as its bispectrum .    this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we give a brief review of the @xmath0 formalism and a definition of the three non - linear parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 given in @xcite .",
    "we also give a general inequality between @xmath3 and @xmath4 which is not found in the literature . in sec .",
    "iii , we study the background dynamics in the modulated reheating scenario . in sec .",
    "iv , we study the perturbations in this scenario and give expressions for @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the final section is devoted to a summary .",
    "we use the units @xmath7 .",
    "according to the @xmath0 formalism @xcite , the curvature perturbation on a uniform energy density hypersurface @xmath8 at time @xmath9 is , on sufficiently large scales , equal to the perturbation in the time integral of the local expansion from an initial flat hypersurface ( @xmath10 ) to the final uniform energy density hypersurface . on sufficiently large scales ,",
    "the local expansion can be approximated quite well by the expansion of the unperturbed friedmann universe .",
    "hence @xmath11 where the @xmath12-folding number @xmath13 is defined by the time integral of the local hubble parameter , @xmath14    in many inflationary scenarios , which include the modulated reheating scenario , the dynamics of the universe between @xmath15 and @xmath9 is determined by the values of the relevant scalar fields @xmath16 at @xmath15 and by the @xmath12-folding number which becomes a function of @xmath17 .",
    "hence the curvature perturbation at @xmath9 is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the perturbation of @xmath16 on the flat hypersurface at @xmath15 , and @xmath20 are given by @xmath21 because solutions of the unperturbed friedmann equation give @xmath22 , the knowledge of the background solutions is enough to know the higher order correlation functions of @xmath8 .",
    "the connected parts of the power spectrum , bispectrum and trispectrum are defined as @xmath23 here @xmath24 means that we take the connected part of @xmath25 . using eq .",
    "( [ deln3 ] ) , we can express @xmath26 and @xmath27 in terms of the correlation functions of @xmath19 , which are given to leading order by @xcite , @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the power spectrum , bispectrum and trispectrum of the scalar fields respectively , defined by @xmath31 if @xmath19 are independent gaussian variables with the same variance which we denote as @xmath32 , then @xmath33 and @xmath34 and @xmath35 vanish . in such a case ,",
    "deviation from gaussianity of the primordial perturbation comes only from super - horizon evolution , and the non - gaussianity is characterized by three constant parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 defined by @xmath36 using eqs .",
    "( [ deln8])-([deln10 ] ) , we have the following expressions , @xmath37 eq .",

    "the single inflation model yields @xmath41 .",
    "however in multi - field inflation , there is a possibility that two vectors @xmath39 and @xmath42 are nearly orthogonal .",
    "in such a case , @xmath3 is very small but @xmath4 and possibly also @xmath2 remains finite .",
    "hence the leading non - gaussianity comes not from the bispectrum but from the trispectrum .",
    "in the modulated reheating scenario @xcite , the decay rate @xmath43 of the inflaton @xmath44 is a function of scalar fields @xmath16 ( not necessarily a single field ) which are light during inflation .",
    "we assume that fluctuation of the inflaton field generates negligible curvature perturbation .",
    "then the detailed form of the inflaton potential @xmath45 during inflation is not important for the scenario .",
    "we only require that @xmath45 around the minimum is approximated well by a term quadratic in @xmath44 .",
    "after inflation , the inflaton oscillates around the minimum of the potential .",
    "the energy density of the inflaton @xmath46 averaged over one period of the oscillation behaves as a function of the @xmath12-folding number @xmath47 .",
    "hence we regard @xmath46 as dust .",
    "the inflaton decays into radiation with rate @xmath43 which depends on the expectation values of @xmath16 .",
    "then the background equations are given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the energy density of radiation .",
    "spatial fluctuations of these light fields induce the fluctuation of the decay rate and the curvature perturbation . by solving the above equations from the end of inflation to the completion of reheating with the initial conditions",

    "@xcite , mode functions in pure de - sitter spacetime are used throughout the evolution of the above correlation function , though the use of such mode functions are not necessarily justified during the oscillatory phase after inflation . in our formalism , we have only to know the field fluctuations at the end of inflation .",
    "however , even in this case , mode functions in pure de - sitter spacetime are not good approximations after the relevant scale crosses the horizon .",
    "this is because the hubble parameter may decrease by an order of magnitude from the horizon exit to the end of inflation . in this paper , instead of using eq .",
