    "the key steps of the star formation process such as large - scale gas infall , disk accretion , and mass ejection have been studied mainly in nearby isolated star - forming regions by various methods such as the analysis of : spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , gas kinematics , density structures of parental cores , and molecular outflows / jets ( e.g. , evans et al .",

    "hence , studies of the formation and evolutionary processes of embedded clusters , as well as associated gmcs , are crucial to understand the general features of star formation . moreover ,",
    "these embedded clusters , identified as a group of infrared excess sources , are often associated with dense filamentary structures , and most likely represent the youngest association of the embedded stellar - clusters ( myers 2009 ) . in order to observationally investigate the initial conditions of embedded clusters , it is essential to spatially resolve the individual star - forming cores within molecular filaments , obtain kinematic information , and investigate the fragmentation properties and physical conditions of each of the cluster members .",

    "our studies , which will cover the entire system of omc filaments in the continuum , as well as molecular line emissions in the ( sub)millimeter ( described in section 2.1 ) , will include a statistically significant number of embedded sources .",

    "the evolutionary stage of detected sources will be discussed in .    moreover , to determine the flux - recovering ratio for the entire filament , we proceeded in the following manner .",
    "first , we calculated the total sma flux over the entire image ( after convolving the image with the jcmt beam ) , @xmath23 ( @xmath416 jy/14@xmath5 beam ) ; this corresponds to the sum of the fluxes of each of the sma sources since we detected no extended emission from the filament itself in our sma image .",
    "second , we determined the jcmt contour level that corresponds to the the sma 5@xmath11 detection level ( 100mjy/4@xmath5.5 beam ) , i.e. , 0.97jy/14@xmath5 beam ; this was used as a lower threshold for extended emission in the jcmt image .",
    "we then summed up the flux within this contour in the jcmt image , @xmath24 ( @xmath4103 jy/14@xmath5 beam ) .",
    "finally , we divided the two fluxes , @xmath25 , and found that only 16% of the total jcmt flux was recovered in our sma data .",
    "it is technically possible to combine the sma data with the data in order to recover the flux from short antenna spacings .",
    "however , we did not apply this method due to the following reasons : ( i ) jcmt / scuba is a bolometer and covers a much wider frequency range as compared to the sma ( @xmath26 ) , and ( ii ) jcmt / scuba frequency coverage includes several strong molecular lines such as co , hco@xmath27 , and so .",
    "hence , the jcmt continuum emission map may be contaminated by emission from these molecular lines .      in order to further discuss the properties of the detected sources ,",
    "it is important to know the limits of our sma observations .",
    "figure 4(a ) shows the mass distribution of the detected sources in omc-3 ( filled histogram ) .",

    "since the number of detected sources were limited , and the error bars for the distribution scale as @xmath29 ( a poisson distribution was adopted for the errors ) , it is difficult to discuss the characteristic mass from our present results .",
    "a full analysis of core census will be our future goal with a more extensive sample .",

    "we consider that it is possible to detect sources less than because recent sma continuum observations have actually detected 31 circumstellar disks with a mass range from toward the same orion star - forming region ( 28 in the trapezium cluster and 3 outside of the trapezium cluster ; mann & williams 2009 a , b ) as shown in ( open histogram ) .",

    "the source size of smm 5 , shown as the largest circular source size in figure 4(b ) , is larger than the sma detectable size  this is because we used a two - dimensional gaussian fitting method for determining the source size .",

    "the perturbation wavelength for maximum instability ( hereafter we simply call this the jeans length ) is described as follows ( e.g. , nakamura , hanawa & nakano 1993 ; wiseman & ho 1998 ) :    @xmath47    in order to understand the physical mechanism of fragmentation processes over a wide range of size scale , the measured source separation is plotted as a function of the number density of their respective parental molecular clouds / clumps / cores in .",
    "note that the inclination of the filaments should be taken into account in this discussion . according to genzel & stutzki ( 1989 )",

    ", core separations in the case of are plotted in as open symbols .",
    "table 6 summaries the number densities , structure separations , and gas temperatures of different structures .",
    "these structures are listed by size : gmcs ( @xmath491pc ) , large - scale clumps ( 0.51.0 pc ) , small - scale clumps ( 0.10.5 pc ) , and dense core ( @xmath500.1 pc ) . here",
    ", we assume that dense cores are formed via the fragmentation of parental small - scale clumps , which in turn are formed via the fragmentation of parental large - scale clumps , and that these latter structures are formed via the fragmentation of parental gmcs .",
    "the measured separations were plotted as a function of the number density of the parental large scale structure . to further discuss the smaller scale fragmentation properties , the separation of the visible binary stars studied in the orion nebula cluster ( onc ; reipurth et al .",
    "2007 ) are also plotted assuming that the number density of their parental core is similar to that of our sma continuum source .",
    "we overplot on figure 5 the perturbation wavelength , @xmath51 , given in equation ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) for various gas temperatures .",
    "the observed fragmentation spacings ( denoted in figure 5 as filled symbols ) are roughly following a single power law over almost four orders of magnitude , suggesting that the hierarchical fragmentation could be governed by a single physical process .",
    "figure 5 indicates that the data is described better by a shallower index , -1.4 ( dashed line ) , than that predicted maximum instability size as a function of density of an isothermal clouds , -2.0 ( solid line ) .",
    "this shallower index can be explained by differences of cloud temperatures over different size scales .",
    "parsec - scale gmcs are exposed to ionized gas from hii regions , cosmic rays , large - scale turbulence , etc . , which work as heating processes .",
    "consequently , the mean temperature of parsec scale clouds tends to be relatively high ( e.g. , in the isms ; e.g. , ferriere 2001 ) .",
    "intermediate regions ( both large- and small - scale clumps ) of the omc molecular cloud ( 0.1 - 1.0 pc ) is also most likely exposed to the strong interstellar radiation field from nearby star forming clusters , e.g. , strong heating from the exterior , corresponding to 1000 times stronger interstellar radiation field as suggested toward a few small - scale clumps in the omc-2/3 region from the co isotopes observations with monte carlo line radiative transfer models ( e.g. , j@xmath52rgensen et al . 2006 ) .",
    "this strong radiation is able to produce the higher gas temperature ( @xmath5330 k ) at the outer most part of the envelope gas .",
    "finally , deeply embedded dense cores within filaments are shielded from these heating processes .",
    "thus , the innermost parts of clouds have low temperatures ( e.g. , ; cesaroni & wilson 1994 ; wiseman & ho 1998 ; tatematsu et al .",
    "this decrease in temperature with size scale , means the fragmentation length will also decrease more sharply than the isothermal case .",
    "this leads to a more shallow power law in figure 5 .",
    "moreover , the dissipation of the magnetic flux on the smaller scale can also be responsible for the observed shallower power law index . since large - scale diffuse structures are always exposed to cosmic ray and/or ionized gas from the surrounding hii region ,",
    "the fractional ionization in large - scale molecular clouds is higher than in the small scale dense gas core .",
    "therefore , ambipolar diffusion will be more efficient in the dense cores , leading to less magnetic support , and a smaller fragmentation length ( e.g. , nakano & tademaru 1972 )",
    ". finally , turbulence , which is often observed in gmc size scales ( larson 1981 ; solomon et al . 1987 ) , can also be responsible for the observed shallower power law index .",
    "detailed discussion for the omc case will be described in the section 4.2.3 .",
    "observational results suggest that the fragmentation spacings , especially at the scales of clumps ( ) , are roughly consistent with the maximum instability size derived from either the initially uniform density cloud ( orange solid line in figure 5 ) or cylindrical clouds ( blue solid line in figure 5 ) assuming increasing temperatures with size scale .",
    "this indicates that the fragmentation may be occurring through the thermal fragmentation process .",
    "the sma detected continuum sources ( denoted in figure 5 by triangle shaped data points ) are embedded within a filament .",
    "hence the core separation should be around the maximum instability size of the cylindrical clouds model ( denoted in figure 5 by blue line ) .",
    "however , the observed core separation is a factor of 2.07.3 smaller than the thermal fragmentation spacing with , @xmath54 @xmath3 ( table 6 ) , and @xmath55=90@xmath48 . in the next subsection",
    ", we explore different physical processes that can affect the fragmentation size scale .      from our sma",
    "observational result , the observed fragmentation ( @xmath56=0.035 pc ) is smaller than the jeans length of the clump .",
    "projection effects are not sufficient to explain this difference : @xmath57 for @xmath58 . in order to further discuss the fragmentation properties within the orion a gmc , we summarize different possible mechanisms that can affect the fragmentation size scale .",
    "* turbulence : * in this case , the cloud fragmentation length is described by equations ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) with the effective sound speed instead of the sound speed .",
    "the @xmath59 is defined as @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the observed velocity dispersion and is given by @xmath62 , where @xmath63 and @xmath64 correspond to the thermal and non - thermal velocity dispersion , respectively .",
    "turbulence will therefore produce a fragmentation scale larger than the jeans length .",
    "figure 5 and table 6 present that observed clump separations are roughly consistent , or smaller , than the thermal fragmentation lengths for scales of a few pc .",
    "these results suggest that turbulence has already decayed for size scales @xmath501 pc . for scales of a few pc or larger",
    ", turbulent pressure may in fact be dominant .",
    "for example , jackson et al . (",
    "2010 ) studied a filament that spans 80 pc and conclude that its observed fragmentation scale ( @xmath45 pc ) can only be described by an isothermal filamentary cloud determined by turbulent pressure , or equivalently , by a self - gravitating incompressible fluid cylinder .",
    "our data indicates that the omc 3 filament fragmentation can not be explained by this scenario .    *",
    "magnetic field and cloud rotation : * other physical processes that might affect the fragmentation length of filaments are helical magnetic field and cloud rotation ( fiege & pudritz 2000 ; matsumoto , nakamura , & hanawa 1994 ) .",
    "in fact , matthews et al . (",
    "2001 ) use helical field geometry of magnetic field to interpret their jcmt / scuba polarization observations toward omc-3 .",
    "their data indicate that the magnetic field in the northern part of omc-3 is toroidal .",
    "hanawa et al .",
    "( 1993 ) has performed magnetohydorodynamical simulations for filament fragmentation , consisting of an isothermal rotating cloud + helical magnetic field , and found a dispersion relation ( eq 11 , hanawa et al .",
    "we can write the fragmentation wavelength for the toroidal magnetic field case as :    @xmath65}\\ ] ]    where @xmath66 represents a length scale of the parental clump , and given by    @xmath67    where @xmath68 is the peak density of the parental clump , and the effect from magnetic field and rotation are described by @xmath69 and @xmath70 as :    @xmath71    @xmath72 is the rate of rotation and @xmath73 is the magnetic field strength .",
    "equation ( 5 ) shows that if @xmath491 , the maximum instability size will become smaller than the thermal fragmentation length . if , the effects from the magnetic field and rotation are negligible .",
    "* global collapse of the parental cloud * recent theoretical studies present how cloud structures and global collapse significantly affect local fragmentation properties ( e.g. , burket & hartmann 2004 ; pon et al . 2011 ; pon et al . 2012 ) .",
    "if the original parental cloud is not infinitely long or spherical , gravitational focusing results in enhanced concentrations of mass inducing global collapse unless magnetic fields , cloud rotation , and/or external pressure are dominated ( burket & hartmann 2004 ) . as we can see from the jcmt / scuba 850 @xmath0 m continuum observations ( figure 2 , right panel ) , the parental filamentary clump ( e.g. , 1.5 jy beam@xmath22 denoted by thick contour ) shows a relatively well defined edge , so according to burket & hartmann s model , global collapse could potentially be underway in this clump . a recent paper by pon et al ( 2011 ) pointed out that filamentary geometry is the most favorable situation for the smallest perturbation to grow before global collapse overwhelms the cloud .",
    "their following paper ( pon et al .",
    "2012 ) suggested that filaments with large aspect ratio would take more time to collapse .",
    "for example , the global collapse time - scale for a cloud aspect ratio of 10 ( similar case of the observed clumps ) is roughly seven times slower than the spherical free - fall time .",
    "this can explain how local fragmentation at the size scale of dense cores and global collapse of their parental small - scale clump could be concomitant .",
    "global collapse will eventually shorten the spacing between the fragmented cores , and this scenario could therefore potentially explain the observed shorter fragmentation length compared to jeans length .    in summary",
    ", there are three physical mechanisms that can increase ( turbulence ) or decrease ( magnetic fields and rotation , or global collapse ) the fragmentation length relative to the jeans length .",
    "the fragmentation lengths obtained from the data presented in this paper are consistent ( 0.3 pc -1pc scale ) or smaller ( @xmath50 0.1pc scale ) than the jeans fragmentation length , suggesting that turbulence does not play a significant role in the fragmentation process for these size scales .",
    "note that some of their core are larger than their associated jeans length , therefor , they could fragment further .",
    "we discussed how the magnetic field and cloud rotation , or global collapse may decrease the observed fragmentation length .",
    "however , at the moment we are unable to quantitatively constrain @xmath74 , or inflow from the global collapse for our case  only future direct comparisons between higher - dynamic range kinematic data and more realistic models can properly address these issues .",
    "* core fragmentation : * in addition to the clump large - scale fragmentation properties discussed above , we would like to explore further the smaller core - scale fragmentation properties , which is related to binary star formation ( @xmath501000 au ) . these binary stars observed in the orion nebula cluster ( onc )",
    "have a wide range of separations from (; reipurth et al .",
    "the plotted results in figure 5 suggest that wide binary systems ( @xmath49200 au ) might follow the same power law index extrapolated from the observed large size scale cloud fragmentation , i.e. , these wide binaries could be formed through the next level of hierarchical process .",
    "this lends support to the theoretically predicted binary formation scenario through the hierarchical fragmentation of the parental core occurs in the isothermal collapse phase ( e.g. , goodwin et al .",
    "2007 ; machida et al . 2008 ) .",
    "close binary systems ( @xmath50100 au ) might be formed through other mechanisms ; hydrodynamic simulations suggest that angular momentum within the rotating and collapsing hydrostatic first cores is a crucial parameter to determine the later fragmentation properties ( e.g. , boss 1989 ; bonnell and bate 1994 ; bate 1998 ; saigo & tomisake 2006 ; machida et al .",
    "furthermore , star - disk encounters could also play an important role in re - distributing angular momentum in protoplanetary disks and forming binary systems ( e.g. , larson 2002 ; pfalzner 2004 ; 2005 ) .      one interesting issue related to filament fragmentation is whether the fragmentation occurs simultaneously in the entire filament , or instead propagates along it producing sequential star formation along the filament . with the sma continuum observations , we found the following interesting tendencies among the sources ; ( i ) a chain of continuum sources is detected in the northern part of the filament from to with a similar spatial separation , ( ii ) a relatively extended fluffy source ( elongated structure ) , , is located at the center of the chain of the continuum sources , and this fluffy structure seems to be still in the process of core formation ( or fragmentation ) .",
    "no star formation signatures such as outflow / jet association or infrared source are found , which supports the idea that is probably the youngest star formation site within the filament .",
    "why does , which is located in the middle of the filament , have the fluffy structure ?",
    "a fragmentation process which propagates along the filament from each end inwards can be one possibility to explain this .",
    "previous numerical calculations give us a hint that the finite geometry of gas clouds promotes concentrations of material at the ends of the filament , at the beginning of the filament fragmentation .",
    "hanawa , yamamoto , & hirahara ( 1994 ) performed one - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of a finite long filamentary cloud .",
    "these simulations suggest that dense cores are produced with a semi regular interval in space and time from one edge to the other .",
    "the gas near the edge is attracted inwards by gravity and the accumulation of the gas makes a dense core near the edge .",
    "when the dense core grows in mass up to a certain amount , it gathers gas from the other direction .",
    "accordingly the dense core becomes isolated from the main cloud and the parent filamentary cloud has a new edge . via the same process , the next accumulation of gas at the new edge makes a new dense core .",
    "the fragmentation is considered to propagate with approximately the effective sound speed ( derived from the simulation by hanawa yamamoto & hirahara 1994 ; derived from a linear stability analysis by nakamura , hanawa , & nakano 1993 ) .",
    "signatures of the fragmentation propagating down the filament is actually observed in the taurus molecular cloud -1 region ( hanawa , yamamoto & hirahara 1994 ) .",
    "our sma results also show that the chain of continuum sources , from to , are embedded within the most northern part of the filaments where both ends show edge - like density contrast ( finite filamentary clouds with two edges ; ) .",
    "the mean value of the observed velocity width in is approximately in this region ( a mean velocity width derived from nh@xmath8 observations toward the norther omc cloud by cesaroni & wilson 1994 ) and the effective sound speed is estimated to be .",
    "the mean projected distance from the sources at the two edges of the filament ( i.e. , and ) to is measured to be .",
    "therefore , the time scale of the fragmentation propagation is estimated to be approximately .",
    "the detected continuum source in the filament have similar to the protostellar phase ( peterson & megeath 2008 ; megeath et al .",
    "the typical evolutionary time scale of such sources are ( beichman et al .",
    "1986 ; shu et al .",
    "estimated propagation time scale of the filament fragmentation is similar to , or slightly longer than , the star formation time - scales of the detected sources .",
    "this may suggest that the protostars formed within the fragmented cores , where star formation began almost at the same time as the clump fragmentation .",
    "more complete fragmentation time scale analysis ( including other parts of the omc filaments ) will be presented in following papers .",
    "high - resolution continuum observations have been carried out using the sma toward the northern filament with a mosaic of covering approximately ( ) .",
    "the data were supplemented by multi - wavelength data sets for investigating evolutionary stage of each source .",
    "the main results are summarized as follows :    1 .   with the sma observations ,",
    "12 dust continuum sources have been identified and spatially resolved with an mass between and the source size between .",
    "we found 850 @xmath0 m continuum counterpart to the previously known ten sources and present the discovery of two new additional sources .",
    "the detected sources have a variety of structures and evolutionary stages , ranging from prestellar phase to the class 0/i phases .",
    "the jeans analysis suggests that all the detected sources are most likely gravitationally unstable .",
    "multi - wavelength data sets confirmed that 6/12 ( 50 % ) continuum sources have molecular outflows , 8/12 ( 67 % ) continuum sources are associated with infrared sources , and 3/12 ( 25 % ) continuum sources are associated with ionized jets .",
    "these results suggest that the omc-3 is an active protostar forming region .",
    "hierarchical structure with quasi - periodical separations on different size - scales is suggested with a size of down to , implying a multi - size scale fragmentation process .",
    "fragmentation spacings in clumps are roughly consistent with the thermal fragmentation lengths in each structure .",
    "however , shorter spacings than those expected from thermal fragmentation have been detected in the sma data ( @xmath40.04 pc ) .",
    "this could be explained by either an helical magnetic field , parental cloud rotation , or / and large - scale filament collapse .",
    "3 .   possible evidence for sequential fragmentation as local conditions",
    "evolve is suggested in the northern part of the filament .",
    "the fragmentation propagation timescale is estimated to be .",
    "this time scale is roughly consistent with ( or slightly longer than ) the life time of the detected protostellar sources , which is .",
    "these results suggest that the protostars formed within the fragmented cores , and that star formation began at almost the same time as the core fragmentation .",
    "our interferometric observations successfully resolved the detailed gas structure associated with the individual star formation sites within the filamentary structure .",
    "however , present observations are still limited by mass sensitivity ( @xmath490.15 m@xmath28 ) and suffer from the large missing flux of the filament ( @xmath7516% recovering flux ) . due to this",
    ", we are biased to detect relatively bright and compact structures ( i.e. , mostly massive envelope associated with the pre - stellar and protostellar cores ) . in order to detect less bright sources ( e.g. , emission from class ii sources , brown - dwarf mass sources ) and to obtain a wider evolutionary range from the sample ,",
    "even higher sensitivity observations are required .",
    "in addition , a larger sample is crucial to investigate the evolutionary tendencies along the entire omc filaments .",

    "<S> we present a high angular resolution map of 850 @xmath0 m continuum emission of the orion molecular cloud-3 ( omc 3 ) obtained with the submillimeter array ( sma ) ; the map is a mosaic of 85 pointings covering an approximate area of ( 0.88@xmath10.27 pc ) . </S>",
    "<S> we detect 12 spatially resolved continuum sources , each with an mass between and a projected source size between . </S>",
    "<S> all the detected sources are on the filamentary main ridge ( @xmath2 @xmath3 ) , and analysis based on the jeans theorem suggests that they are most likely gravitationally unstable . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of multi - wavelength data sets indicates that of the continuum sources , 6/12 ( 50 % ) are associated with molecular outflows , 8/12 ( 67 % ) are associated with infrared sources , and 3/12 ( 25 % ) are associated with ionized jets . </S>",
    "<S> the evolutionary status of these sources ranges from prestellar cores to protostar phase , confirming that is an active region with ongoing embedded star - formation . </S>",
    "<S> we detect quasi - periodical separations between the omc-3 sources of @xmath417@xmath5/0.035 pc . </S>",
    "<S> this spatial distribution is part of a large hierarchical structure , that also includes fragmentation scales of gmc ( @xmath435 pc ) , large - scale clumps ( @xmath41.3 pc ) , and small - scale clumps ( @xmath40.3 pc ) , suggesting that hierarchical fragmentation operates within the orion a molecular cloud . </S>",
    "<S> the fragmentation spacings are roughly consistent with the thermal fragmentation length in large - scale clumps , while for small - scale cores it is smaller than the local fragmentation length </S>",
    "<S> . these smaller spacings observed with the sma can be explained by either a helical magnetic field , cloud rotation , or / and global filament collapse . </S>",
    "<S> finally , possible evidence for sequential fragmentation is suggested in the northern part of the omc-3 filament . </S>"
