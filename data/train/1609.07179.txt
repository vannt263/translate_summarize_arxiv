    "the emergence of cooperation in games played by individuals drawn from the same population has been widely studied in the literature across many branches of science @xcite .",
    "typically , focus relies on the prisoner s dilemma ( pd ) and on the snowdrift game ( sg ) . in well - mixed populations ,",
    "defectors take over in the former class of game while defectors and cooperators co - exist in the latter class , although in the sg there is still a paradox due to the fact that the average fitness of the population is lower than it would be if only cooperators survived in the steady - state .",
    "thus , mechanisms to increase the frequency of cooperation have been studied for both classes of games .",
    "one popular mechanism is the inclusion of spatial structures such as spatial lattices with periodic boundary conditions and moore neighbourhood where each individual interacts only with the eight nearest neighbours , reachable by a chess - king s move @xcite . while in the pd structured",
    "populations tend to increase cooperation , in the sg defectors are favoured @xcite .",
    "a second popular mechanism is to keep the population well - mixed and include additional strategies in the payoff matrix of the stage - game .",
    "examples of additional strategies in the sg are the bourgeois @xcite , the retaliator @xcite and the punisher @xcite . in the latter , an individual programmed to play the punisher strategy acts as a cooperator when facing an opponent willing to cooperate but acts as punisher when facing a defector , i.e. , the individual pays a cost to punish such that the defector also incurs a loss which is larger than the cost .",
    "punishers transform cooperators into a type of free - rider where the former pay the costs while the latter enjoy the benefits of the harm done to defectors .    in this paper ,",
    "i use the framework of evolutionary game theory ( egt ) to analytically study the sg . differently from the usual literature ,",
    "i study the sg played by individuals drawn from two different well - mixed populations . in this case , although in the steady - state cooperation and defection co - exist as in the sg played by a single population , there are two steady - states instead of a single one . in both steady - states , one population ends up only with cooperators and the opponent population contains only individuals programmed to defect .",
    "i then study two mechanisms based on punishment in order to enforce full cooperation in both populations .",
    "the first mechanism is an extension of @xcite , i.e. , i include a third strategy in the strategy set of both populations .",
    "the dynamic model can be studied in the @xmath0-space and results are in line with @xcite in the sense that extinction of defectors in both populations may be a stable steady - state in which only neutral stability is attained and the existence of more than one basin of attraction implies that the elimination of defectors depends on the initial conditions . in the second mechanism , instead of including additional strategies into the stage - game , the pure strategy cooperation is replaced by a new mixed strategy which i name cooperation - punishment ( cp ) .",
    "the essence of this new strategy is that with a given exogenous probability , a cooperator might punish a defector .",
    "depending on the frequency of punishment , the penalty on defectors and the cost to punish , the sg may have the best response structure of its payoff matrix transformed for example into a class of coordination game or a game with dominant strategy other than a pd . while in the latter case , defectors become worse off , in the former extinction of defectors is feasible depending on the initial conditions .",
    "the advantages of the second mechanism of punishment are twofold : first , from a mathematical point of view , the dynamics is kept in the more intuitive @xmath1-space as in @xcite s 3-strategy sg played by one single well - mixed population ; second , from an evolutionary point of view , differently from the mechanism that relies on the introduction of a new character who always punishes defectors , extinction of defectors is independent from the initial conditions and , differently from @xcite , stability is asymptotic .",
    "neutral invasion of any population is not possible anymore . despite the differences pointed out above",
    ", both mechanisms still share one important aspect of @xcite , which is the minimum required level of punishment in order to eliminate defectors in a population .",
    "the latter is satisfied as long as the frequency of punishment is above @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the cost - to - net - benefit ratio as defined in @xcite and @xmath4 is the penalty a defector faces when punished .    in other words ,",
    "the second mechanism displays a simpler model where cooperation , punishment and defection are possible behaviours , still keeps the same threshold as in @xcite to eliminate defection , but the robustness of the equilibrium in which defection becomes extinct is improved .",
    "the deterministic results obtained through egt are then confirmed in a stochastic agent - based simulation where i extend the strategy updating criterion used in @xcite to the case of agents selected from two different populations . to my best knowledge",
    ", this is the first time in the literature that such simulation is carried out with two competing populations .",
    "a target agent obtaining a lower payoff than the referencing agent may update his strategy probabilistically . during each monte carlo time step , on average , all agents have the chance to update their strategy .",
    "strategies are updated asynchronously .",
    "i show that both the analytical model and the simulations display good agreement regarding the steady - states and the evolutionary patterns .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "i review the sg played by one population and introduce the sg played by two populations as well as the two different mechanisms to enforce cooperation based on punishment .",
    "the analysis uses egt based on the replicator dynamics ( rd ) . in section 3 the agent - based simulation",
    "is carried out and results are compared with the analytical results of the previous section .",
    "section 4 concludes .",
    "i depart from a sg repeatedly played over time between two randomly selected players , each belonging to one of two very large different populations , the latter named populations @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "thus , individuals drawn from one population only interact with opponents drawn from the other population , i.e. , own - population effects are not taken into account in the two - population game . in the classic two - player sg",
    ", each player has two pure available strategies , either to cooperate ( @xmath7 ) or to defect ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "when both players cooperate , each receive a reward payoff @xmath9 resulting from the benefit of cooperation @xmath10 net of the cost to cooperate @xmath11 , which is shared by both players .",
    "on the other hand , when only one player cooperates , the cooperator bears the entire cost @xmath11 , getting a `` sucker '' payoff @xmath12 , while the opponent earns the costless temptation payoff @xmath13 .",
    "if neither player cooperates , both earn nothing , i.e. , they get each @xmath14 .",
    "given @xmath15 in the sg , we have @xmath16 .",
    "this can be represented by the following payoff matrix : @xmath17 multiplying all entries in the previous matrix by @xmath18 , it can be transformed into an equivalent matrix in which payoffs depend on the cost - to - net - benefit ratio @xmath19 , where @xmath20 : @xmath21 in well - mixed populations , based on the rd and on ( [ matrix - i ] ) , the classic sg assumes that all individuals belong to the same population and the following ordinary differential equation ( ode ) governs the evolution of the proportion of cooperators @xmath22 over time : @xmath23\\ ] ] leading to the set of stationary points @xmath24 , where @xmath25 , from which only @xmath26 is asymptotically stable , i.e. , @xmath27 , thus an evolutionary equilibrium ( ee ) as defined in @xcite . as a consequence , in the sg played by individuals drawn from a well - mixed homogeneous population ,",
    "cooperation emerges with a frequency @xmath28 and defection co - exists with the latter and has frequency @xmath3 . for the sg played by individuals drawn from a well - mixed heterogeneous population ,",
    "see @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the inclusion of a third pure strategy named punishment leads to the extinction of defectors if @xmath3 is below a given threshold , but generally the population evolves to a mixture of cooperators and punishers and stability of the equilibrium is not robust in the sense that only neutral stability , but not asymptotic stability , holds .    keeping the stage - game as in ( [ matrix - i ] ) but assuming that each player comes from a different population , results change substantially .",
    "in such a case , the evolution of cooperation in each population is governed by the following non - linear system of odes : @xmath29\\label{rd - ix}\\\\ \\dot{x_2}&=&x_2(1-x_2)\\left[(b - c/2)(1-x_1)-c/2 \\right]\\label{rd - iy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the phase space becomes the unit square @xmath30\\times[0,1]\\in\\re^2 $ ] and the stationary points are the corners of the phase space @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 as well as there is an interior stationary point @xmath35 .",
    "analysing the linearised system in the neighbourhood of the stationary points , the eigenvalues of the jacobian matrix evaluated at the corners of the phase space are @xmath36 and @xmath37 , which are both negative at @xmath32 and @xmath33 and both positive at @xmath34 and @xmath31 . on the other hand ,",
    "the eigenvalues of the jacobian matrix evaluated at @xmath35 are @xmath38 .",
    "thus , the latter is a saddle point , @xmath34 and @xmath31 are sources and @xmath33 and @xmath32 are sinks .",
    "there are two basins of attraction and , differently from the sg played by one single population of agents , the system evolves to one of two asymptotically stable nodes leading to one population of only cooperators and one population of only defectors .    on the other hand ,",
    "similar to the sg played by a single well - mixed population , defection always co - exists with cooperation when the sg is played by two populations , although only one strategy survives in each population . in the next two sub - sections ,",
    "i look into two mechanisms to enforce extinction of defection in both populations .",
    "the first mechanism follows the approach in @xcite and consists in the introduction of an additional pure strategy in both populations in order to punish defectors with certainty .",
    "although it is possible to eliminate defectors completely , this evolutionary pattern depends on the initial conditions and on the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "i then look into a second mechanism , consisting of a change of behaviour of the individuals programmed to cooperate .",
    "i assume that cooperators may also punish defectors with a certain exogenous probability .",
    "the latter mechanism is equivalent to replace the pure strategy cooperation by a mixed strategy where the individual randomizes his choice between cooperation and punishment .",
    "it has the mathematical advantage that the dynamics is kept in the more intuitive @xmath1-space which , as in the system defined by ( [ rd - ix ] ) and ( [ rd - iy ] ) , makes it possible to keep the use of a planar phase space to study the evolutionary pattern of both populations as well as the possible dependence of each pattern on the initial conditions .",
    "moreover , as will be shown in this section , differently from the mechanism that relies on the introduction of a third character who always punishes defectors as in @xcite , stability is asymptotic whenever defectors become extinct in both populations .",
    "i start incorporating punishment into the sg by introducing a third pure strategy named punishment ( p ) , in the same way it is done in @xcite except that i deal with a two - population sg . in this setup ,",
    "whenever a cooperator and a punisher meet it is the same as if two cooperators were meeting , thus both get the payoff @xmath39 as in ( [ matrix - ii ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "when a punisher meets a defector , the former pays a cost @xmath40 in order to enforce a penalty @xmath4 on the latter . considering only the case @xmath41 , bounded rationality is still present in such a setup , i.e.",
    ", the loss incurred by defectors is larger than the cost payed by punishers whenever the latter decide to punish . the payoff matrix in ( [ matrix - ii ] )",
    "then becomes : @xmath42 the non - linear system representing the rd that governs the evolution of the shares of cooperators and defectors in populations @xmath43 is : @xmath44\\label{rd - iiix}\\\\ \\dot{y_i}&=&y_i\\left [ ( 1-y_i)(r - y_j)-\\beta(1- y_i)(1-x_j - y_j)+\\alpha y_j(1-x_i - y_i)\\right]\\label{rd - iiiy } \\label{rd - iii}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are respectively the shares of cooperators and defectors in population @xmath47 .",
    "the share of punishers present in the population is given by @xmath48 .",
    "in the same vein of the system given by ( [ rd - ix ] ) and ( [ rd - iy ] ) , there are two asymptotically stable states @xmath49 and @xmath50 where defectors take over one population and cooperators take over the opponent population . also , similar to @xcite",
    ", there is an invariant manifold @xmath51 containing a set of neutrally stable points that attract the vector field if @xmath52 .",
    "any region of the invariant manifold that violates the previous condition repeals the vector field . therefore , depending on the initial states of both populations , the system might evolve to a stable state with a mixture containing a share @xmath45 of cooperators and a share @xmath53 of punishers , i.e. , defectors become extinct in both populations as long as the frequency of punishment is at least @xmath54 .",
    "note however that neutral invasion can still occur , i.e. , if a small share of defectors invade the system , defection becomes extinct again but the shares of cooperators and punishers at the steady - state generally change .    the result can be confirmed from the jacobian matrix @xmath55 evaluated at those stationary points , where @xmath56 : @xmath57    based on the previous set of equations , the jacobian matrix evaluated at @xmath58 leads to the set of eigenvalues @xmath59 , thus all eigenvalues are negative and @xmath58 is always asymptotically stable .",
    "the stationary state @xmath50 is also asymptotically stable given @xmath60 leads to the same set of negative eigenvalues .    for the invariant manifold @xmath51",
    ", the jacobian matrix gives the set of eigenvalues @xmath61 .",
    "stability requires non - zero eigenvalues to be negative , which is satisfied if @xmath62 .",
    "although the system is non - hyperbolic at nodes @xmath51 and the condition obtained from the jacobian matrix is not sufficient to guarantee stability , this can be confirmed from the numerical simulations in figure [ fig:1 ] . in both panels of the figure",
    ", the initial state of each population contains a mixture of cooperators , defectors and punishers where defectors are relatively rare , i.e. , the initial condition is located sufficiently close to the invariant manifold @xmath51 . in the left panel ,",
    "the condition for the extinction of defectors @xmath63 is satisfied . in the right panel , this condition is violated and , even with an initial state in which defectors are a residual share of just 1% of population 1 , the latter take over that population .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "the emergence of cooperation was studied in a two - population snowdrift game using two different mechanisms based on punishment .",
    "the first mechanism followed the traditional approach in the literature in which a third strategy is added to the game . in this case",
    ", i extended the framework in @xcite to the case of two well - mixed populations contesting against each other .",
    "a non - standard mechanism was then considered , in which the strategy to cooperate was modified in order to allow cooperators to be able to punish defectors with a given exogenous frequency .",
    "the latter was equivalent to replace pure strategy @xmath7 by a mixed strategy in which players randomize between cooperation and punishment . in both cases , defectors became extinct if the probability of punishment was above @xmath64 . on the other hand , although defectors could become extinct in both populations under the two different mechanisms of punishment , the second mechanism led to a more robust equilibrium given that the latter was asymptotic instead of the neutrally stable equilibrium attained by the first mechanism of punishment .",
    "moreover , from a purely mathematical point of view , the second mechanism had the advantage that the dynamics of the game could be studied in the @xmath1-space instead of the less - intuitive @xmath0-space .",
    "evolutionarily speaking , in the second mechanism , whenever cooperators were to take over both populations , extinction of defectors was a globally asymptotically stable state for any interior initial conditions in the phase space .",
    "results were obtained analytically using a non - linear system of ordinary differential equations and were then compared with results from an agent - based simulation , which displayed a good level of agreement with the former . regarding future research , two immediate extensions would be to consider a spatial game in a squared lattice with moore neighbourhood and periodic boundary conditions or to take into account endogenous ( frequency - dependent ) payoffs in the stage - game .",
