    "this solution is obtained inside a particular subset characterised by alternating signs and `` splitting '' or factorization properties .",
    "the reasons that motivated us for a study in smaller dimensions and not directly in four , were the absence of the difficulties due to the renormalization and the pure combinatorial character of the problem in zero dimensions .",
    "another useful aspect of the zero dimensional case is the fact that it provides a direct way to test numerically the validity of the method .    in a more recent",

    "our numerical results are coherent with our basic theorems . more precisely :    1 .",
    "the validity of the contractivity criterion by the iterated mapping @xmath4 , is verified up to the value @xmath5 for the coupling constant .",
    "the calculations give an indication that it should be true beyond this value , the limit being below @xmath6 with the relaxation method used here .",
    "unstable _ behaviour appears with amplified oscillations for bigger values of the coupling constant .",
    "the `` good '' properties of `` alternating signs '' and `` splitting '' are certainly verified by the constructed solution ( truncated sequence @xmath7 ) .",
    "when the coupling constant increases beyond the critical value @xmath8 , the number of iterations needed for the convergence @xmath9 grows rapidly and the stability of the green s functions in a finite time is ensured only for a reduced number of green s functions        we consider the vector space @xmath10 of the sequences @xmath11 by the following :    the functions @xmath12 belong to the space @xmath13 of continuously differentiable numerical functions of the variable @xmath14 ( which physically represents the coupling constant ) .",

    "we find that @xmath77 converges towards values a little greater than @xmath19 , ( as it was expected theoretically ) .      for small values of @xmath15 ,",
    "the algorithm converges monotonically ( fig .  1 ) , but damped oscillations appear ( starting from the value @xmath78 ) for bigger values of @xmath15 .",
    "an approximated pseudo - period can be found .",
    "it is roughly linearly linked to the `` dimension '' of the space , because of the perturbations due to the particular form of the mapping .",
    "when @xmath15 increases , the oscillations are less and less damped , very slightly damped for @xmath79 ( fig .",
    "2 ) , and then amplified , more and more , and remain with a smaller and less stable pseudo - period , before explosion .",
    "these oscillations do not appear if @xmath72 roughly , or @xmath15 very big . in the latter case",
    "the divergence occurs before the end of the first pseudo - period .",
    "the convergence ( verification of the contractivity criterium ) which has been proven mathematically up to @xmath81 can here be shown numerically for values slightly larger , and we can see how it is progressively destroyed , since a pronounced instability appears in the form of amplified oscillations when the coupling constant increases .

    "they are , of course , at the disposal of all interested readers , in the corresponding electronic version of the journal  @xcite .    1 .",
    "for small coupling constant , @xmath83 , the curves of @xmath57 ( i.e.  the values of @xmath12 s for which the convergence is obtained ) as a function of @xmath56 ( the dimension of the used truncated sequence ) show a good convergence , for sufficiently small @xmath56 .",
    "but , when @xmath56 increases , analogous instabilities appear again : there are damped oscillations , then amplified oscillations and there is no more convergence . just before the threshold of this phenomenon",
    ", the number of iterations needed for the convergence grows very rapidly .",
    "the curves of @xmath58 ( i.e.  the corresponding @xmath84 s of the iteration for which the convergence is obtained ) as a function of @xmath85 , show similar properties of the iteration procedure . for small values of the coupling constant",
    "the convergence is obtained ( for both the @xmath84 s and the enveloppe of the curves ) as far as @xmath56 increases .",
    "+ for @xmath5 , no instability appears up to @xmath86 ( with a limit of @xmath87 iterations ) , and the maximum @xmath58 obtained can be found around @xmath88 . for @xmath89 ,",
    "some instabilities appear for @xmath85 near @xmath90 , and for @xmath91 , they begin for @xmath92 .",
    "3 .   finally",
    ", the curves representing @xmath9 ( the iteration order for the convergence of each component ) as a function of @xmath85 make evident an analogous behaviour . moreover , these curves yield some concrete idea about the speed of convergence of the iteration . + for small values of the coupling constant ( @xmath93 ) , the number of iterations needed to obtain the convergence grows roughly linearly with the dimension of the space @xmath85 and the component number @xmath94 .",
    "the first components converge rapidly and independenly of @xmath85 because the different green s functions are very weekly coupled and reach their limit value before the truncation number ( @xmath85 ) takes his largest values .",
    "+ when the coupling constant grows ( @xmath95 ) , the required number of iterations for the convergence , @xmath9 , grows very rapidly and all the components @xmath12 , but the first ones , converge simultaneously being strongly coupled between them .",
    "the convergence is no more obtained for bigger values of @xmath85 .",
    "+ this divergence occurs for smaller and smaller @xmath85 , when @xmath96 increases .      1 .   in order to study more precisely the behaviour of the convergence",
    ", we also obtained numerical results and curves showing the ratio @xmath97 at fixed @xmath96 and @xmath56 .",
    "the convergence again is evident up to the values @xmath98  ( @xcite ) .",
    "oscillations appear from @xmath99 and they are amplified for larger values of the coupling constant .",
    "we also explored another aspect of the iteration by perfoming a kind of `` _ _ map _ _ ''  @xcite as follows .",
    "+ the iteration process starts _ upwards _ : from the @xmath100 green s function and @xmath15 we calculate the @xmath101 green s functions using the iteration formulas and we verify the sign of each of the green s functions .",
    "if the alternating signs ( positive for @xmath100-negative for @xmath102 etc . ) are obtained , that means the convergence is guaranteed .",
    "if the sign is wrong , the iteration yields values without any physical significance ; then , the convergence is impossible .",
    "3 .   in order to accelerate the convergence of the iteration we are looking at two types of investigations :",
    "* we can `` _ _ redefine _ _ '' each step of the iteration by putting together the calculations of @xmath103 steps of our previous procedure .",
    "* we also can define another starting point of the iteration by choosing appropriate and more physical values of the splitting sequence , in terms of the values of the coupling constant .",
    "more precisely , if instead of the fundamental sequence @xmath50 , we take as initial point of the iteration one of the previous fixed points ( at a given value of @xmath15 and @xmath85 ) one expects a very rapid convergence to the physical solution without chaotic behaviour .",
    "+ these two last points are under investigation @xcite .",

    "they are also grateful to b  grammaticos for a critical reading of the paper and crucial remarks .",
