    "superthermal linewidths are commonly observed in molecular clouds , whether self - gravitating or not .",
    "both internal and external driving mechanisms have been suggested as the source of these velocities ( cf . norman & silk 1980 ; fleck 1983 ; henriksen & turner 1984 ; falgarone & puget 1986 ; scalo 1987 ; mouschovias 1987 ; myers & goodman 1988 ; falgarone & phillips 1990 ; elmegreen 1990 ; passot et al .",
    "1995 ) . virtually every suggested mechanism for producing the observed linewidths requires mass - motions and/or non - linear wave motions both of which are dissipative ( field 1979 ; zweibel & josafatsson 1983 ; ghosh et al .",
    "recent simulations by maclow et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and padoan & nordlund ( 1998 ) find that mhd turbulence decays on shorter timescales than previously thought .",
    "thus , interstellar turbulence requires continuous injection of kinetic energy .",
    "the most obvious source in large clouds is internal star formation .",
    "there is , however , a type of molecular cloud , the high latitude translucent variety ( van dishoeck et al .",
    "1991 ) , that show the same superthermal velocity fields but do not display evidence of star forming activity ( e.g. magnani et al . 1995 ) . in the absence of internal driving mechanisms such as star formation or gravity ,",
    "the motion must be continually produced by an _",
    "external _ agent .",
    "it is for this reason that we have carried out a dynamical study of the translucent molecular cloud mbm16 ( magnani , blitz , & mundy 1985 , hereafter referred to as mbm ) .",
    "our choice of this cloud is quite deliberate . in our earlier paper ( magnani , larosa , & shore 1993 , hereafter referred to as mls93 ) we reported finding several large - scale formaldehyde clumps in mbm16 .",
    "these observations in @xmath2 indicate that the clumps have a higher density than the rest of the cloud .",
    "we concluded that mbm16 is not self - gravitating and that its internal structures are transient .",
    "each clump has a distinct average centroid velocity that differs from the others by about 0.5 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the difference is not due to a large scale systematic motion . to quantify this ,",
    "we have examined the standard statistical measures for the line profiles .",
    "the velocity centroid dispersion within each clump , @xmath4 in the notation of kleiner and dickman ( 1985 , and references therein ) was found to be quite low , @xmath50.2 km s@xmath3 , relative to the cloud as a whole determined from @xmath0co data , 0.44 km s@xmath3 , and relative to the clump to clump centroid velocity difference of 0.5 km / s .",
    "the co data were , however , based on a severely undersampled map . in this study , we present the results of a more extensive @xmath0co map of the cloud supplemented by new @xmath1co observations of the densest formaldehyde clump that support and extend our earlier conclusions .",
    "a complete map of mbm16 was made in the @xmath0co ( j=1 - 0 ) transition using the 1.2 m harvard - smithsonian center for astrophysics millimeter wave telescope .",
    "the telescope front end configuration is described by dame ( 1995 ) .",
    "the map is a 6@xmath6 6@xmath7 grid in galactic longitude and latitude ( @xmath8 168@xmath7 to 174@xmath7 and @xmath9 @xmath1034@xmath7 to @xmath1040@xmath7 ) approximately centered on the cloud .",
    "the beamwidth of the telescope at 115 ghz is 8.4 arcmin and the separation between the samples was 3.6 arcmin for a total of 97 @xmath11 97 points or 9409 spectra . at the assumed cloud distance of 80 pc ( hobbs et al .",
    "1988 ) 8.4 arcmin corresponds to a linear resolution of 0.2 pc .",
    "the data were taken in frequency - switched mode at a velocity resolution of 0.65 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the total bandwidth was 150 km s@xmath3 centered at 0 km s@xmath3 with respect to the lsr .",
    "typical rms noise values for each spectrum were in the 0.133 to 0.281 k range .",
    "a contour map of the integrated antenna temperature ( @xmath12 ) is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the velocity map is shown in figure 2 .",
    "mbm 16 is clearly centered in the map , and is completely enclosed by the mapping pattern .",
    "the general shape of the cloud is similar to the poorly - sampled map by mbm , and the ragged structure is reminiscent of other high latitude clouds . at the bottom left of the field in figure 1",
    "is a heretofore unidentified high latitude cloud .",
    "since the lsr velocity of the new cloud is significantly different from that of mbm 16 , it is likely that the two clouds are at different distances .",
    "the molecular gas comprising mbm 16 ranges in velocity from 4 to 10 km s@xmath3 , while the new cloud lsr velocities lie between -20 and -5 km s@xmath3 .",
    "similarly , in the northeast corner of figure 1 is a molecular feature which has lsr velocities in the 12 - 14 km s@xmath3 range .",
    "co channel maps of this region indicate that this feature is also likely to be a separate molecular cloud ( magnani et al .",
    "1998 , in preparation ) .",
    "we have also mapped the largest formaldehyde clump and a portion of another in @xmath1co at higher resolution than we reported in mls93 .",
    "these data were obtained during two observing sessions at the nrao 12 meter telescope at kitt peak , arizona , 1992 dec .",
    "26 - 1993 jan .",
    "1 and 1993 july 2 - 7 .",
    "the 3 mm receiver with an sis mixer operated with a total system plus sky temperature between 300 and 700 k. dual polarizations were fed into a 100 khz filter back end , providing a velocity resolution of 0.26 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the data were obtained in frequency switched mode with separation of @xmath132 mhz .",
    "the polarizations were averaged together and the resulting spectrum was folded resulting in typical _ rms _ noise temperatures from 10 to 30 mk after hann smoothing .",
    "we used a uniformly spaced 20@xmath1127 grid with 3 arcmin separation between beam centers ( the beam size is @xmath14 1 arcmin at 113 ghz ) .",
    "the map concentrated primarily on clump 3 in the h@xmath15co study described in mls93 , although a portion of clump 2 was included in the western section of the map . the integrated @xmath1co(j=1 - 0 )",
    "intensity map of the region is shown in figure 3 .",
    "line emission was detected in about 200 of the 540 map positions .",
    "for fully developed turbulence , over a large enough region the dispersion in the centroid velocities should be about the same as the individual line widths .",
    "the @xmath1co data agrees with the h@xmath15co results in showing a much smaller centroid dispersion within the clumps . following kleiner & dickman ( 1985 ) , for the entire sampled cloud",
    "the parent velocity dispersion of the mapped region , @xmath16 ( _ i.e. _ , the average dispersion of the individual spectra , @xmath17 , is 0.25 km s@xmath3 , and the dispersion in the intensity weighted velocity centroids determined from gaussian profile fitting , @xmath18 , is 0.31 km s@xmath3 . for the leftmost clump located at @xmath19ra @xmath20 50.25 ) in fig .",
    "3 , @xmath21 = 0.21 and @xmath22 = 0.10 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the implication is that the clumps are coherent in velocity .",
    "the @xmath1co map is , however , too small to be useful for a correlation study .",
    "our new @xmath0co map is fully sampled and sufficiently large to permit such an analysis .",
    "the velocity correlation function is the simplest description of the dynamical properties of a flow . by definition ,",
    "the spatial velocity correlation function for a homogeneous turbulent flow is : @xmath23[v_{i}(r+\\tau ) - < v_{i}(r)>]>\\ ] ] where the angle brackets denote the spatial averages .",
    "the lag , @xmath24 , is a scalar quantity .",
    "we are , of course , limited to measuring only the radial velocities so we can construct only the longitudinal velocity autocorrelation along the line of sight , @xmath25 .",
    "we normalize the autocorrelation function by its value at zero lag , @xmath26 . in standard terminology , this is known as the biased autocorrelation function ( see miesch & bally 1994 , hereafter referred to as mb94 ) .    before performing the autcorrelation analysis",
    ", we trimmed the data to remove points in the map with velocities that are clearly in excess of the bulk of the cloud . in this case , we retained all points with a signal to noise ratio of 4.5@xmath27 or higher with @xmath28 km s@xmath3 , the range of velocities found within mbm16 .",
    "as discussed in scalo ( 1984 ) and further elaborated in mb94 , any correlation analysis requires some filtering of the dataset to remove the large scale trends .",
    "therefore , we have applied two different methods to the mbm16 data . in the first procedure",
    ", we subtracted the mean velocity , 7.24 km s@xmath3 , from the trimmed map to form the fluctuation map . in the second procedure we subtracted a smoothed map from the data that was obtained from the trimmed map by taking a running mean filter of preset set size that included only detected points",
    "this is the procedure used by miesch and bally .",
    "we then carried out the autocorrelation analysis of these filtered @xmath0co data using two independent methods .",
    "the first , which is identical to the one described in mb94 , used the two dimensional fast fourier transform ( fft ) in idl .",
    "for comparison , in the second we used the scalar algebraic correlation function .",
    "the results are plotted in figures 4 and 5 .",
    "figure 4_a - c _ shows the two dimensional correlation results for ( a ) the mean subtracted , ( b ) the 15 point smoothed , and ( c ) the 30 point smoothed maps . in view of the agreement between the different procedures , and the lack of systematic trends in the velocity , we use method ( a ) for figure 5 and the subsequent analysis . in figure 5 , we show the comparison between the scalar ( 1d ) and 2d correlation funnctions for the mean subtracted map .",
    "the two methods agree .",
    "there is a detectable correlation up to 5 lags or 18.0 arcmin , which corresponds to a physical length of 0.42 pc . to further understand what the correlation function is measuring , and in particular how to define the correlation length",
    ", we performed a series of simulations for which the results are shown in figure 6 . to generate a test random map with the same spatial distribution as the real data",
    ", we took the trimmed map , normalized it to unity for all detections , and then multiplied each detected location by a gaussian random number with a unit dispersion . the correlation function for this completely random map",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "notice that although the velocity is spatially confined to the regions where co was detected , there is no hint of any spatial stucture in the figure .",
    "we then simulated the presence of a coherent structure within this map by setting all velocities in a 10@xmath1110 region equal to a constant and , in a series of trials , varied the constant .",
    "this creates a coherently moving clump of known size and kinetic energy .",
    "the velocity was increased from 0 to 2 km s@xmath3 to produce a set of maps that were then run through the same analysis as the real data .",
    "what they show is that there are clear limits to the information that can be derived from a correlation analysis , but that the detection of a correlated flow is possible .",
    "for instance , in figures 6_b - d _ , the amplitude of the velocity was increased from 0.5 km s@xmath3 to 2.0 km",
    "s@xmath3 where the random map has velocities in the range -6.3 to 4.4 km s@xmath3 .",
    "again , we note that the velocity dispersion was 1 km s@xmath3 . with an amplitude of 0.5 km",
    "s@xmath3 , the clump had about 3% of the total power in the map , and the structure was clearly undetectable ( fig .",
    "6b ) . for 1 km",
    "s@xmath3 , or about 13% of the total power , the structure is obvious ( fig .",
    "6c ) , and becomes more so with increasing energy .",
    "an additional result of the simulations is that the size of the coherent region is not the @xmath29 point but where the correlation function has its first zero ( e.g. townsend 1976 ) .",
    "more important is the result that the lack of detection of a coherent region by the correlation method merely places an upper limit on the size and power of such regions , but does not rule out their presence .",
    "on the basis of a purely statistical analysis of the line profiles for a number of molecular species , @xmath0co , @xmath1co , and h@xmath15co , it is clear that mbm16 contains a number of regions with exceptionally low dispersions in the line centroid velocity .",
    "we emphasize that these are not simply `` quiet spots '' in the flow .",
    "the individual profiles throughout these regions have the same widths as the rest of the cloud , which is much larger than the dispersion in the centroids .",
    "the implication of this observation is that the size - line width relation ( larson 1981 ) breaks down for this cloud .",
    "this is shown in detail in figure 7 .",
    "there is no systematic trend to the data , and those regions identified in mls93 from the formaldehyde observations clearly stand out in the @xmath0co data as anomalously underdispersed for their size .",
    "the results of our correlation analysis support and strengthen these statistical conclusions . we find a correlation length of roughly 18 arcmin , corresponding to a physical scale of about 0.4 pc .",
    "our simulations suggest that these regions must together contain at least 10% of the kinetic energy of the cloud .",
    "we argue that these regions are the interstellar analogs of the _ coherent structures _ that usually accompany turbulence generated in free and bounded shear flows .",
    "these have been the subject of increasing attention in the past few years as their importance in turbulence has been more clearly recognized in terrestrial flows ( e.g. lumley 1989 ; george & arendt 1991 ; robinson 1991 ; mccomb 1991 ; shore 1992 ; holmes , lumley , & berkooz 1996 ) .    in the most general case where the flow can be driven both internally and externally",
    ", it is likely that no single source scale would be detected using correlation methods because none exists .",
    "instead , the variety of processes act on so many different scales that the no one produces a clean dynamical signature . as far we know",
    ", there have been no previous dynamical studies of any _ isolated _ non - star forming cloud .",
    "it is therefore not surprizing that no unambiguous velocity correlation length is generally found ( e.g. mb94 ) .",
    "scalo ( 1984 ) suggested that a length scale of order 0.3 pc in the @xmath30 oph cloud might be due to turbulence , although it was possible that large scale structure could produce a similar signature .",
    "it is precisely the simplicity of the velocity field in mbm16 that makes such a detection more likely if it exists .",
    "this cloud is nearby so we can obtain fully sampled maps of comparatively small scale structures .",
    "more important , the lack of internal sources for turbulence in mbm16 means that any external driver will leave a recognizable signature in the velocity field of the cloud .",
    "if we are correct in assigning the source of the coherent structures to an external shear flow , then there are important consequences for the interpretation of the line profiles in this and other clouds .",
    "first , such phenomena should be ubiquitous in the interstellar medium .",
    "for instance , any h i cloud should show similar structures .",
    "boundary layer effects have already been invoked in chemical studies of molecular clouds ( e.g. charnley et al .",
    "in particular , we suggest that a correlation analysis of a high velocity h i cloud might reveal coherent structures generated by boundary shear with the interstellar medium .",
    "second , such driven turbulence will produce mhd waves so long as the fluid and magnetic field are coupled .",
    "this is true throughout the interstellar medium .",
    "third , the fact that large scale external driving can feed the observed internal motions points to a long - lived source . even though both mhd waves and turbulence are intrinsically dissipative , the longevity of the driver can overcome the dissipation and maintain the stability of the clouds for very long times",
    "thus , the detection of turbulence does not imply any particular youth for the clouds .",
    "our purpose in this paper has been to characterize the velocity field within a non - star forming molecular cloud .",
    "we were guided by earlier h@xmath31co observations at 6 arcmin resolution ( 0.14 pc ) that showed dynamical ordering on a length scale of about 0.5 pc . using higher resolution and a far more complete @xmath0co map , we find evidence for a velocity correlation on a scale of 0.4 pc . we attribute this to the formation of coherent structures in a externally driven turbulent shear flow .",
    "this could easily be the source for both mhd and fluid turbulence on small scale within this and other molecular clouds and supply kinetic energy to the clouds on potentially long timescales .",
