    "a non - equidistant steps in the magnetization , somehow similar to those experimentally observed , can be simulated by allowing an increase of coupling constants @xmath30 with magnetic field . as the physical mechanisms of interatomic coupling , in the simplest picture , have to do with the overlap of orbitals centered at different sites , a justification of the @xmath35 dependency",

    "an averaging of calculated grid - dependent properties over a finer fcc - type sub - grid has been done , as described by @xcite .",
    "the calculations have been done for the `` as determined '' crystal structure , i.e. , corresponding to the ground state of @xmath14=0 .",
    "we allowed moreover a structure relaxation for antiferromagnetic ( afm , @xmath14=0 ) and ferromagnetic ( fm , @xmath14=1 ) configurations .    before discussing the results",
    "it should be noted that the siesta method does not include the treatment of spin - orbit interaction , hence it is not possible to discuss the magnetic anisotropy parameters on the basis of calculation . in principle , the calculation of zero - field splitting @xmath19 is not only possible , but yields the quantitative results of very high accuracy .",

    "the fsm scheme fixes the total number of electrons in majority- and minority - spin channels .",
    "this amounts to imposing an effective external magnetic field , which  at least in metal systems ",
    "introduces a difference in the chemical potential for majority- and minority - spin electrons .",
    "when applied to molecular magnets , the fixed total moment can be only an integer ( and usually even ) amount of bohr magnetons .",
    "isolated magnetic molecules have discrete kohn - sham energy levels , and normally , a non - zero homo - lumo gap .",
    "therefore both spin channels may still possess a common chemical potential ( if their respective homo - lumo gaps do overlap ) , or they may need , similarly to the case of a metallic system , an external magnetic field for enforcing the splitting . in the former case ,",
    "the dft solutions corresponding to different fsm values coexist as metastable states , whose total energies can be directly compared . in the latter case , a zeeman term must be taken into account as an additional energy needed to split the chemical potentials in two spin channels .",

    "[ fig : fsm ] shows the total energies for a number of configurations with different fsm values ( left panel ) , along with corresponding homo - lumo gaps in two spin channels . for setting up an afm configuration ( zero fsm value ) ,",
    "the local magnetic moments of two ( arbitrary , due to nearly perfect tetrahedral symmetry ) ni atoms were inverted .",
    "this configuration then always survived in the course of self - consistent calculation .",
    "the corresponding spin - resolved local densities of states ( dos ) for two oppositely magnetized ni atoms and several of their neighbours are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] . a fragment of the molecule , including the path between two ni atoms , is depicted in the inset .",
    "it is well seen that the local dos at the ni site in the majority - spin channel is dominated by a fully occupied @xmath39 subband , which forms a single narrow peak . in the minority - spin channel",
    ", one sees a crystal - field splitting into the @xmath47 ( occupied ) and the @xmath48 ( empty ) energy levels .",
    "such clear separation , without a pronounced further splitting , is due to the fact that the oxygen octahedra around the ni atoms are almost undistorted .",
    "the above electronic configuration corresponds to the spin value @xmath1=1 per ni atom , consistently with experiment .",
    "the value of the _ local _ magnetic moment per ni atom , as determined by the mulliken population analysis , may however differ from 2 @xmath49 , depending on the spatial distribution of the spin density and its decomposition into different basis orbitals .",
    "in particular , the charge transfer from ni to o reduces the nominal value of the majority - spin ni@xmath39 occupation , at the same time inducing magnetic moments at the oxygen ligands .",
    "the values of local magnetic moments at several representative atoms is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] on the left to each plot .",
    "obviously the ni atom with its six o neighbours makes a fragment which essentially carries the magnetic moment of 2 @xmath49 ; the magnetization of mo atoms is not pronounced .    such cumulative spins @xmath1=1 per nio@xmath11 fragment remain relatively intact if one imposes different values of the fixed spin moment .",
    "the afm state ( fsm = 0 @xmath49 ) , the one with the spin of one nio@xmath11 group inverted ( fsm = 4 @xmath49 ) and the fm state ( fsm = 8 @xmath49 ) can all easily be realized , and differ only slightly in their total energies .",
    "it is noteworthy that the imposed fsm value of 2 @xmath49 converges to a configuration where three nio@xmath11 groups maintain the spins @xmath1=1 , and the fourth ni atom becomes non - magnetic ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fsm ] , left panel ) .",
    "this configuration lies higher in energy than the three previously mentioned ones . yet in all four cases there is a common gap between occupied and unoccupied states in both spin channels ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fsm ] , right panel ) , that means that all four configurations can be realized as metastable magnetic solutions , without imposing an external magnetic field and hence without an extra energy cost due to the zeeman term .    the energy of the fsm = 2 @xmath49 configuration can not be used for the mapping of calculation results to the heisenberg model , because it contains a different number of isolated spins as the other three cases . for fsm = 0 , 4 , and 8 @xmath49 the difference in energies comes from different orientation of `` rigid '' magnetic moments , and hence can serve for an attempt to extract the magnetic interaction parameters . as can be seen in table i , which compares the energy differences between three orientations of four @xmath1=1 spins according to the heisenberg model and to the calculation results , such extraction is not straightforward .",
    "actually it is an indication that the heisenberg model does not reasonably describe magnetic interactions in the `` ni@xmath0 '' molecule .",
    "this qualitative observation is consistent with the analysis of experimental data discussed above .",
    "the best one can do is to provide an order - of - magnitude estimate of the heisenberg exchange parameter , which is positive , i.e. favouring the antiferromagnetic coupling ( in the definition of eq .",
    "[ eq : heis ] ) , and hence consistent with experiment , and has the magnitude @xmath50 3587 k. the earlier discussed @xmath30 value estimated from the fit to experimental results of magnetic susceptibility ( fig .  [",
    "fig : suscep ] ) are 69 k. to some extent , the difference can be due to underestimating the intraatomic correlation effects in a conventional dft calculation .",
    "it has been shown by @xcite for the mn@xmath2-acetate molecule and by @xcite for the `` v@xmath51 '' molecular magnet that an artificial enhancement of the on - site hubbard - like correlation within the lda+@xmath52 formalism @xcite favours the localization of the magnetic moment at the @xmath39 atoms and tends to reduce the interatomic magnetic interactions . however , the selection of `` correlated '' states has to be done _",
    "ad hoc _ in the lda+@xmath52 formalism , and the magnitude of the necessary correction enters the calculation as an external tuning parameter .",
    "c@c@c fsm ( @xmath53 )    ' '' ''    & @xmath54 & @xmath55 ( mev ) + 0 & @xmath56 &  0 + 4 & 0 &  6 + 8 & @xmath57 & 60 +    it should be noted that the afm configuration , being a broken - symmetry state , is _ not _ a faithful representation of the true @xmath14=0 ground state of the system .",
    "moreover it is obviously a frustrated state , because each ni atom interacts with one ni magnetized in parallel and two antiparalelly magnetized counterparts , whereas all coupling constants are expected to be identical , for symmetry reasons .",
    "nevertheless , the calculated total energy of this broken symmetry state ( table i ) may be mapped onto the predictions of the heisenberg model , taken together with the results for other two lowest - energy configurations , according to the fsm analysis of fig .",
    "[ fig : fsm ] .",
    "( afm state ) and 8 @xmath49 ( fm state ) . [ fig : relax ] , width=491 ]    in conclusion we discuss the structure optimization of the `` ni@xmath0 '' molecule in afm and fm configurations , which correspond to the fsm values of 0 and 8 @xmath49 , correspondingly .",
    "the aim of the simulation was to check whether the interatomic distances in the molecule would tend to become pronouncedly different in two magnetic configurations , that would probe the assumption of large magnetostriction in the molecule . our preliminary results ( fig .  [ fig : relax ] )",
    "does not seem to confirm the latter hypothesis , but definite conclusion can be only be made on the basis of fully relativistic calculations .",
    "our present simulation includes relativistic effects but the spin - orbit interaction ; consequently , the influence of magnetic structure on total energy and forces is only via the hybridisation which is slightly different in fm and afm configurations . when starting from the reported experimental geometry , an initial stage of relaxation ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : relax ] ) substantially lowered the total energy , and induced strong fluctuations of interatomic distances .",
    "eventually the molecule recovers ni  ni distances of 6.66.7  , not pronouncedly different in fm and afm cases . a subsequent smooth lowering of the total energy",
    "does not yet seem converged after 200 conjugated gradient steps .",
    "the fact that the total energy of the fm configuration in fig .",
    "[ fig : relax ] lies , over a large number of simulation steps , lower than that of the afm , does not contest our above result concerning the system s tendency for the afm coupling .",
    "the two curves in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : relax ] reflect two different relaxation histories , so that two solutions which accidentally correspond to the same step number stay in no obvious relation to each other .",
    "a meaningful comparison of the fm and afm total energies requires either the identical structure ( as it has been done in the previous section ) , or full relaxation of structures in two magnetic configurations to be compared .",
    "summarizing , we attempted a fit of experimental magnetic susceptibility and magnetization data for the `` ni@xmath0 '' magnetic molecule to the heisenberg model , including zero - field splitting ( single - ion anisotropy ) and allowing variations of exchange parameters @xmath30 with the external magnetic field .",
    "it seems that fixed ( magnetic field and temperature - independent ) values of @xmath30 do not allow to achieve an acceptable fit of experimental dependencies . as a microscopic reason for the @xmath30 dependency on magnetic field , we assume a magnetostriction in the `` ni@xmath0 '' molecule to play an important role . without the deformation of the molecule in the magnetic field taken into account ,",
    "the results of first - principles calculations are consistent with experimental data : they indicate an antiferromagnetic interaction between ni atoms , and confirm the conclusion that the magnetic properties of the system can not be fit to the isotropic heisenberg model .",
    "an attempt to simulate the relaxation of the molecule from first principles indicated a not very pronounced difference in the ni  ni distances between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic configurations of the molecule .",
    "however , the spin - orbit interaction has not been included in the present simulation ; yet it is essential for a precise treatment of magnetic anisotropy and magnetostriction , so its inclusion is likely to affect the results .",
