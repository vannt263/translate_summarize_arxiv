    "superconductivity and ferromagnetism are two ubiquitous but competing phenomena in condensed matter systems .",

    "an interesting phase , the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state  @xcite , has been suggested as the concurrence of both ferromagnetic and oscillatory superconducting orders  @xcite , but its direct confirmation is still elusive .",
    "recently , owing to the capability of controlling particle densities , tuning interactions , and cooling into quantum degeneracy  @xcite , cold atomic systems have become a promising platform for searching for fflo order  @xcite . in experiments of trapped fermi gases , density profiles that reflect the interplay of spin imbalance ( ferromagnetic order ) and cooper pairing",
    "have been observed  @xcite .",
    "in addition , experiments have also revealed a significant dimensional dependence of the profiles : in three dimensions ( 3d ) a fully paired profile takes place at the trap center and a polarized profile does off center  @xcite , while in 1d the central region is always polarized  @xcite .",
    "these observations agree with theoretical studies of the fflo state in 1d and the trap - induced phase separation in 3d  @xcite , but the marked difference between these two limits also raises the need for understanding the intermediate regime .",
    "several works have focused on the dimensional crossover regime of various kinds of continuous systems  @xcite or hubbard lattices  @xcite , but with a different emphasis than the present work .    in this paper , we study a realizable system of a two - dimensional optical lattice array of one - dimensional tubes , subject to a global trapping potential  @xcite .",
    "the incipient dimensional crossover regime of this system , which can be experimentally accessed by gradually lowering the lattice depth , is modeled by incorporating the kinetics of single - particle tunneling ( st ) as well as a key ingredient representing the tunneling of paired opposite - spin atoms  pair tunneling ( pt)between neighboring tubes ( as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : f01 ] ) .",
    "the st leads to an interesting magnetic compressible - incompressible phase transition analogous to that in the bose - hubbard model ( discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but is not responsible for certain observed signatures in the profiles at the dimensional crossover regime ( which will be shown below ) . by considering pt , we are able to describe the incipient evolution of profiles from 1d toward 3d and obtain the emerging signatures of the dimensional crossover at various global polarizations , such as the inversion of the fully paired and polarized centers as well as the growing spatial separation between the fully paired and fully polarized regions .",
    "the paper is outlined as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : pair ] we discuss the microscopic physical cause of the pt and evaluate its strength using a two - channel model . in sec .",

    "( b ) atoms bind via a pervasive feshbach resonant effect during the whole tunneling event , with the effective pair tunneling strength @xmath0.,width=245 ]",
    "for free fermions in a lattice potential , the intersite kinetics is well described by st processes of strength @xmath2  @xcite . for an attractively interacting case where two opposite - spin atoms form a pair of binding energy @xmath3 , the kinetics of the pair tunneling would , in principle , be incorporated as a process in which the two atoms of a pair split , separately tunnel to the other site and rebind [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : f02](a ) ] .",
    "this is contained in the st model as a second order process of strength @xmath4 and accounts for the josephson phenomena in the presence of superfluid orders , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "however , in cold - atom experiments , the interaction is induced via a feshbach resonance  @xcite , which is controlled by the tuning of a magnetic field affecting the hyperfine energy splittings . because the field is applied throughout the system , the interaction that leads to pairing exists on and _ between _ lattice sites .",
    "therefore , we expect that atoms that remain paired during the whole tunneling event can be another viable process [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : f02](b ) ] .",
    "such a process can be described as tunneling of the paired atoms , with strength denoted as @xmath0 .",
    "one can estimate @xmath0 around the feshbach resonant regime using a two - channel model  @xcite that incorporates atomic and molecular degrees of freedom , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively . in optical lattices  @xcite , the partition function of the system is @xmath7 where @xmath8 contains terms associated only with the atomic degrees of freedom , including the atomic tunneling as well as any bare interatomic interaction , and @xmath9 involves the molecular tunneling @xmath10 , molecular chemical potential @xmath11 , and atom - molecule coupling @xmath12 .",
    "here we assume the intermolecular interaction is weak such that a mean - field approximation @xmath13 can be applied to incorporate the interaction as effective contributions to the chemical potentials .",
    "we integrate out the molecular variable @xmath6 in eq .",

    "we also see that even if the molecular tunneling is smaller than the atomic tunneling ( @xmath23 ) , @xmath0 can be comparable to or even larger than @xmath2 in relatively shallow lattices and near the feshbach resonance ( large @xmath12 and small @xmath11  @xcite ) .",
    "realistic values can be estimated as @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( taking the bare molecular limit )  @xcite , where @xmath26 is the differential magnetic moment , @xmath27 is the resonance width , @xmath28 is the background scattering length , @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) is the molecular ( atomic ) wannier wave function on site @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the detuning of the magnetic field . in an ongoing experiment using a setup as in ref .",
    "@xcite with @xmath33  @xcite , we can expect @xmath34 given @xmath35 ( or @xmath36 g ) .",
    "we remark that perturbative renormalization - group analysis starting from 1d becomes unreliable in this parameter regime .",
    "in addition , our system shows pervasive pairing effects and is thus different from an array of josephson junctions that lack the pairing mechanism in the insulating barriers between the superconductors .",
    "therefore , by providing extra channels for josephson - type tunneling , the pt processes can lead to an enhancement of the superfluid order and its cross - tube coherence , anticipating the dimensional crossover regime .",
    "note that we focus here on the leading processes in the lowest bloch band , which has been shown capable of describing well the realized optical lattice systems  @xcite .",
    "we point out that incorporating higher - order , higher - band , or interband processes are possible immediate extensions of our model  @xcite , necessary to explore even wider optical - lattice regimes .",

    "we look at the influence of @xmath0 at fixed @xmath83 , the latter corresponding to a typical lattice depth of @xmath84 and thus into the dimensional crossover regime . in fig .",

    "the lp case we focus on herein is somewhat higher than the critical polarization of @xmath91@xmath92 verified in experiments . ] . from top row to bottom",
    ", @xmath0 is chosen to be either zero , comparable to @xmath2 , or larger than @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "we see that in the lp case at @xmath68 , the axial profile exhibits ( i ) an fflo center with oscillatory @xmath70 , ( ii ) a bcs - like shoulder with non oscillatory @xmath70 , and ( iii ) a normal tail having zero @xmath70 . at the intermediate @xmath0 value , this trilayered",
    "structure remains .",
    "however , the fflo center shrinks , the bcs - like region extends toward the center accompanied by a drop in imbalance , and the normal tail grows .",
    "this indicates a transfer of unpaired majority atoms from the center to the tail , implying an enhancement of a meissner - like effect in the central region .",
    "we notice that the gap profile develops small ripples between the bcs - like shoulder [ ( ii ) ] and the normal tail [ ( iii ) ] , suggesting the incipience of an fflo layer [ ( i ) ] here . at the large @xmath0 value ,",
    "the fflo center is completely conquered by the bcs - like state and disappears , leaving a large fully polarized tail and a thin fflo layer in between them .",
    "because the fflo and bcs centers are distinctive of one-  @xcite and three - dimensional  @xcite trapped systems , respectively , this result shows the evolution of the system from 1d toward 3d , driven by @xmath0 ( compared with increasing @xmath2 ) .    in the hp case , the system always has a center with oscillatory @xmath70 and a fully polarized normal tail . in the oscillatory - pairing region ,",
    "the imbalance profile exhibits characteristic out - of - phase oscillations , with the concurrence of local minima ( maxima ) of @xmath86 and local maxima ( minima ) of @xmath87 .",
    "this behavior is due to the competition between superfluid and ferromagnetic orders .",
    "an increase in @xmath0 enhances this competition , augmenting the magnitude of the out - of - phase oscillations and repelling a portion of the unpaired majority to the normal tail region . at large @xmath0 ( @xmath93 ) ,",
    "the oscillations are large enough that the minima of @xmath86 are almost zero",
    ". such a case is less like an fflo state ( oscillatory pairing accompanied by finite polarization ) , but more like spatial alternation of fully paired superfluid and highly polarized normal gas .",
    "this phenomenon , which is analogous to the phase separation in the lp case , is taken as a signature of the dimensional crossover between 1d and 3d at higher polarizations .",
    "we also notice that the structure of the profiles is reminiscent of that of a system with vortex cores embedded in a superfluid bulk .",
    "we find that pt affects the pairing order not only along but also across the tubes .",
    "figure [ fig : f04 ] shows the value of the gap function at the center of each tube ( @xmath76 ) in a @xmath94 tube array .",
    "the left ( right ) column corresponds to the lp ( hp ) case , while , from top to bottom , rows correspond to zero , intermediate , and large @xmath0 , respectively ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig : f03 ] ) .",
    "we see that at zero @xmath0 the sign of @xmath70 changes , indicating an oscillatory behavior across the tubes . in the lp case when @xmath0 increases , the oscillating nodes appear in a more off - center region , as discussed for the axial profiles along the tubes . at large @xmath0",
    ", there is no oscillation of @xmath70 across tubes in both lp and hp cases , showing the suppression of fflo order .",
    "we notice in figs .",
    "[ fig : f03 ] and [ fig : f04 ] that @xmath0 enhances the maximum magnitude of the gap function , as expected from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : gap ] ) .",
    "this enhancement raises the critical temperature above which the pairing order vanishes and hence agrees with the increase of the superfluid transition temperature in quasi - one - dimensional systems  @xcite .",
    "finally , we look at the phase separation of fully paired and fully polarized regions as a function of @xmath0 . we consider the combined fraction of particles in the highly paired ( @xmath95 ) and highly polarized ( @xmath96 ) regions of the axial profiles ; @xmath97 } /\\int_z \\rho$ ] , where @xmath98 is the step function .",
    "the larger @xmath99 is , the stronger phase separation the system shows .",
    "figure 5(a ) shows that @xmath99 monotonically increases with @xmath0 at three various polarizations when @xmath2 is fixed . in the cases of @xmath100 and @xmath101",
    "the sudden changes indicate the occurrence of the bcs - like center replacing the fflo center .",
    "for comparison we plot also @xmath99 vs @xmath2 at fixed @xmath0 in fig .",
    "5(b ) and observe that @xmath99 shows almost no change at the three polarizations .",
    "this result highlights that it is @xmath0 , rather than @xmath2 , that accounts for the phase separation and hence is essential for the correct model describing the physics at the incipience of the dimensional crossover regime .",
    "by considering the microscopic physics of cold atomic systems , we have incorporated both st and pt processes to effectively model imbalanced fermionic superfluids in an array of one - dimensional tubes at the incipience of the dimensional crossover .",
    "our calculations show that the pt strength is a main factor for the evolution of the system profiles deviating from the one - dimensional limit , which exhibits a central fflo state , toward the development of three - dimensional signatures , including a central fully paired state in the lp case and spatial separation between fully paired and fully polarized states in both lp and hp cases .",
    "these features are reflected in the directly observed density profiles and the pairing orders that can be probed in time - of - flight experiments  @xcite .",
