    "the existing experimental evidence for confinement is based on the search of fractionally charged particles ( quarks ) .",
    "such particles have not been observed , and upper limits have been established which are typically @xmath0 times smaller than what one would expect in the absence of confinement@xcite .",
    "the natural interpretation of that is that quarks do not exist as free particles , and that this absolute property is based on a symmetry@xcite .",
    "no direct evidence exists instead for confinement of other colored particles with zero or integer charge , e.g. gluons .",
    "the question is then : what symmetry of qcd prevents the observation of free quarks and possibly of other colored particles ?    a deconfinement transition is observed in numerical simulations of quenched qcd on the lattice@xcite .",

    "low temperature corresponds to strong coupling regime ( disorder ) , high temperature to weak coupling ( order ) .",
    "the symmetry responsible for confinement is a symmetry of the disordered phase .",
    "the way to observe confinement is to look at the spatial correlator of the polyakov lines g(x - y ) l(x ) l(y)[eq3 ] the polyakov line @xmath14 $ ] is the parallel transport through the lattice along the time axis .",

    "for @xmath26 it is weak first order .",
    "the underlying symmetry is @xmath27 , the centre of the gauge group . in full qcd , however , @xmath27 is explicitely broken by the very presence of quarks , and also @xmath24 does not exist due to the so called string breaking , i.e. to formation of @xmath16 pairs when trying to pull @xmath16 apart .",
    "a chiral phase transition exists in this case , from the goldstone phase to the wigner phase and the order parameter is @xmath28 , the chiral condensate .",
    "the connection of chiral transition to deconfinement is not clear .",
    "this situation is unsatisfactory , especially in view of the philosophy of @xmath29 . according to it the basic structure of the theory",
