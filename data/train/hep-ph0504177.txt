    "in recent years a huge effort has been made in order to understand the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter , both experimentally as well as theoretically .",
    "collisions at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) at bnl and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern allow the experimental study of hadronic matter at energy densities exceeding that required to create a quark - gluon plasma .",
    "the energy and baryon densities of these experiments correspond to temperatures up to 200 mev and a baryon chemical potential in the range 0 - 600 mev .    at zero baryon",
    "chemical potential , lattice calculations suggest the existence of a transition from ordinary nuclear matter to a quark - gluon plasma at temperatures of around 160 mev ( see for example ref .",
    "while there has been progress in generalizing lattice calculations to finite baryon chemical potential @xcite , highly nontrivial problems remain to be solved , and in practice one is restricted to small baryon chemical potentials .",
    "since one can not apply lattice gauge theories to the region of the phase diagram where the baryon chemical potential is large , one must employ other methods .",
    "one possibility is perturbative qcd .",
    "asymptotic freedom guarantees that this method can be applied at asymptotically large chemical potentials .",
    "if the densities are too small to use perturbative qcd , one may apply effective theories .",
    "models such as the instanton liquid model , random matrix models , and nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) models have been applied to the study of the qcd phase diagram at finite temperature and densities . despite their shortcomings",
    ", it is expected that such models do describe the qualitative features of the qcd phase diagram , in regions not accessible to perturbative or lattice qcd .",
    "for example , the existence of a critical point at finite baryon chemical potential has been predicted using effective models  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is expected that quark matter at high baryon chemical potentials and low temperatures can be in a two - flavor color - superconducting phase ( 2sc ) @xcite or a color - flavor locked ( cfl ) phase @xcite . in these phases gaps on the order of 100 mev arise .",
    "many results have been obtained for equal up , down and strange quark chemical potentials . however , this may not be directly relevant for heavy - ion collisions or compact stars .",
    "for example , to enforce electric and color neutrality and weak equilibrium in compact stars different flavor and color chemical potentials have been introduced  @xcite .",
    "this gives rise to a more complicated phase diagram in which one also finds new 2sc - like @xcite and gapless superconducting phases @xcite .",
    "similarly , in heavy - ion collisions , a difference between the quark chemical potentials arises if the number densities of the different quark flavors are not the same .",
    "this difference can cause interesting observable effects such as two critical endpoints  @xcite .",
    "however , instanton induced interactions tend to suppress this effect @xcite .",
    "in addition to a more complicated structure of the superconducting phases , different chemical potentials can also trigger pseudoscalar condensation @xcite .",
    "this has been confirmed on the lattice at zero baryon but finite isospin chemical potential @xcite .",
    "depending on the flavors involved , the charged pion , neutral or charged kaon fields may acquire a vacuum expectation value .",
    "pseudoscalar condensation in the two - flavor njl model has been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , as a function of the different chemical potentials at zero and finite temperature .",
    "an extension to three flavors was carried out in ref.@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the phase diagram of the three - flavor njl model as a function of the different chemical potentials including both pseudoscalar condensation and color superconductivity .",
    "we did not apply electric or color neutrality conditions . at zero temperature ,",
    "pseudoscalar condensation is possible if @xmath0 @xcite or if @xmath1 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "color superconducting phases occur if the chemical potentials are large and approximately equal .",
    "therefore , one can imagine scenarios where for example @xmath2 ( the fermi surfaces of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 quark should be sufficiently close for cooper pairing to occur ) and @xmath5 ( the fermi surfaces of the @xmath3 and @xmath6 should be sufficiently close for kaon condensation to occur ) , with @xmath7 . in such a case",
    "a 2sc phase is competing against a phase in which kaons condense . from our calculations",
    "it follows that a coexistence phase of pseudoscalar condensation and color superconductivity does not occur for the parameters chosen and that these phases are separated by a first - order transition .",
    "however , we do not exclude that other choices of parameters may lead to such a coexistence phase , just as coexistence of color superconductivity and chiral symmetry breaking may occur in the njl model for specific ranges of parameters @xcite .",
    "here we refer to a coexistence phase to mean a phase in which two condensates are nonzero simultaneously .    in this work we study pseudoscalar condensation in the quark anti - quark channel .",
    "we have not taken into account the pseudoscalar diquark interaction .",
    "this interaction is suppressed relative to the scalar diquark interaction due to instantons  @xcite . however in absence of instanton interactions , if one neutralizes the bulk matter with respect to color and electric charges it is possible to have pseudoscalar diquark condensation with rather large gaps @xcite .",
    "pseudoscalar diquark condensation in the njl model is similar @xcite to pseudoscalar condensation in the cfl phase studied with effective chiral models in refs.@xcite .",
    "we emphasize that in this paper we do not impose electric or color neutrality conditions , but that this would qualitatively affect the phase structure , leading for example to the observation that in a macroscopic volume of quark matter the 2sc phase is energetically disfavored  @xcite .",
    "therefore , our results do not address the qualitative features of the qcd phase structure with neutrality constraints imposed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly describe the njl model and the choice of parameters . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss the calculations and some of its technical aspects . in sec .",
    "iv , we present our results , and in sec .  v we conclude .",
    "in the njl model @xcite , one treats the interaction between the quarks as a point - like quark color current - current interaction . this naive approximation to qcd works very well in explaining various low - energy observables such as hadron masses @xcite . by applying several fierz transformations to the current - current interaction (",
    "see for example ref.@xcite ) and including only terms which give rise to attractive @xmath8 and @xmath9 channels , one obtains the following lagrangian density @xmath10 where the quark - antiquark term , @xmath11 , and the diquark interaction term , @xmath12 , are defined below .",
    "we have suppressed the color , flavor , and dirac indices of the fermion fields @xmath13 for notational simplicity .",
    "the mass matrix @xmath14 is diagonal and contains the bare quark masses @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 . the matrix @xmath18 is also diagonal and contains the quark chemical potentials @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "we use the metric @xmath22 and the standard representation for the @xmath23-matrices .",
    "the quark - antiquark interaction part of the lagrangian density is @xmath24 \\;.\\ ] ] the matrices @xmath25 are the @xmath26 generators of @xmath27 and act in flavor space .",
    "they are normalized as @xmath28 .",
    "the diquark interaction term of the lagrangian density is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 since only the interaction in the color and flavor antisymmetric triplet channel is attractive .",
    "the matrices @xmath31 are the generators of @xmath27 and act in color space .",
    "their normalization is @xmath32 . to remind the reader , the antisymmetric flavor matrices @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 couple up to down , up to strange and down to strange quarks , respectively .",
    "the charge conjugate of a field @xmath13 is denoted by @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "the coupling strength @xmath38 of the diquark interaction is fixed by the fierz transformation .",
    "however , some authors discuss the njl model with a different diquark coupling constant ( see for example ref.@xcite for a comparison ) .",
    "the results that will be presented below are obtained with the following choice of parameters @xmath39 this choice of parameters gives rise to constituent quark masses @xmath40 mev and @xmath41 mev @xcite .",
    "to obtain the phase diagram of the njl model , we first introduce 18 real condensates @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and 9 complex condensates @xmath44 as follows @xmath45 we will assume that all condensates are space - time independent . the crystalline larkin - ovchinnikov - fulde - ferrell ( loff ) phase @xcite will not be considered here .",
    "the next step is to apply a hubbard - stratonovich transformation to eliminate the four - point quark interactions to make the lagrangian quadratic in the quark fields . introducing a two - component nambu - gorkov field",
    "@xmath46 allows for straightforward integration over the quark fields . after going to imaginary time ,",
    "the thermal effective potential @xmath47 in the mean - field approximation reads @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a @xmath50 matrix @xmath51 and @xmath52 the matrix @xmath53 is the identity matrix in color ( @xmath54 ) , flavor ( @xmath55 ) , or dirac ( @xmath4 ) space .    the values of the condensates and the phase diagram are determined by minimizing the effective potential @xmath47 with respect to the condensates . to make the minimization procedure easier",
    ", one can take advantage of the fact that certain condensates must vanish .",
    "firstly , application of qcd inequalities @xcite shows that in qcd at zero chemical potential chiral symmetry breaking can not be driven by parity - violating condensates of the type @xmath56 . outside the phase in which diquarks condense , we found numerically that this is also correct in the njl model at finite chemical potentials .",
    "therefore , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are put to zero . secondly ,",
    "although perturbative one - gluon exchange can not distinguish between @xmath60 and @xmath61 condensation with @xmath62 , pseudoscalar condensation is favored due to the instanton interaction @xcite .",
    "we therefore set all @xmath61 s with @xmath63 to zero .",
    "we found numerically that this is correct , despite the fact that the model we consider does not include instanton interactions .",
    "one can further simplify the minimization procedure by using the symmetries of the njl model .",
    "in absence of quark masses and chemical potentials , the lagrangian density has a global @xmath64 symmetry . due to the non - vanishing quark masses ,",
    "the symmetry is broken down to @xmath65 . since we consider different quark masses and finite chemical potentials , the symmetry of the lagrangian density is further reduced to @xmath66 .",
    "the vacuum manifold is invariant under the same transformations as the lagrangian density , so applying a @xmath67-flavor transformation to all condensates leaves the free energy invariant .",
    "therefore , using the @xmath67-flavor transformations one can choose the pseudoscalars to condense in the @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 channels , and set @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 to zero .",
    "the phase in which @xmath68 , @xmath69 or @xmath70 is non - vanishing is called the @xmath74 , @xmath75 or @xmath76 condensed phase , respectively .",
    "because of the global @xmath77 symmetry , one can also rotate away several diquark condensates . without loss of generality",
    ", we can minimize with respect to @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 . in principle , all six diquark condensates can have a phase .",
    "it is always possible to remove two of them by using the two diagonal @xmath77 transformations .",
    "as long as there is no pseudoscalar condensation , one can use the @xmath67-flavor symmetries to rotate away three other phases . as a result",
    "either @xmath84 , or @xmath85 has a phase @xcite .",
    "however , this reduction is not completely possible if pseudoscalar condensation occurs . by choosing the pseudoscalars to condense in the @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 channels , one breaks the @xmath67-flavor symmetry . hence if pseudoscalar condensation arises in one channel",
    ", one can in general rotate away one phase less in the diquark sector .",
    "if it occurs in more channels , two phases less can be rotated away .",
    "however , numerically we find that allowing for a complex phase leads to diquark condensation only in the @xmath78 , @xmath80 and the @xmath83 channels .",
    "the @xmath79 , @xmath81 , and @xmath85 diquark condensates do not arise or can be rotated away .",
    "moreover , we find that pseudoscalar condensation in the quark - antiquark channel does not coexist with color superconductivity , such that one can always take the diquark condensates to be real .",
    "the different possible color - superconducting phases are named as follows @xcite @xmath86    to calculate the effective potential in an efficient way , one can multiply the matrix @xmath49 with @xmath87 which leaves the determinant invariant . in this way",
    ", one obtains a new matrix @xmath88 with @xmath89 s on the diagonal . by determining the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath88 with @xmath90",
    ", one can reconstruct the determinant of @xmath49 for all values of @xmath91 which is namely @xmath92 . after summing over matsubara frequencies ,",
    "one finds @xmath93 \\;.\\ ] ] all that remains in order to determine the effective potential is to integrate over three - momentum @xmath94 up to an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath95 .",
    "the speed of the calculation of the effective potential depends heavily on how fast one can compute the eigenvalues .",
    "there are several ways to speed up the calculation .",
    "firstly , the determinant of @xmath49 does not depend on the direction of @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , one can choose @xmath96 to lie in the @xmath97-direction .",
    "together with the choice of the non - vanishing condensates mentioned above , this implies that @xmath98 becomes a real symmetric matrix , which simplifies the calculation of the eigenvalues .",
    "secondly , one can interchange rows and columns of @xmath88 without changing its determinant . by doing so",
    ", one can bring @xmath88 in a block - diagonal form .",
    "one can then determine the eigenvalues of the blocks separately which is significantly faster since the time needed to compute eigenvalues numerically scales cubically with the dimension of the matrix .",
    "in the most general case with diquark condensation , one can always reduce the problem to two @xmath99 matrices .",
    "moreover , if there is no diquark condensation , but only pseudoscalar condensation , the problem can be further reduced to computing the eigenvalues of two @xmath100 matrices .",
    "we determined the eigenvalues using lapack routines @xcite .",
    "after numerical integration over three - momentum @xmath94 up to the cutoff , the condensates were determined by minimizing the effective potential using minuit @xcite . to be certain that the minimization procedure did not end up in a local minimum",
    ", we always checked the continuity of the minimized effective potential as a function of chemical potentials and/or temperature .",
    "in this section , we present our results for the phase diagrams of the njl model with @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath101 quarks . we plot the phase diagrams as a function of the chemical potentials and temperature . to determine the locations of the phase boundaries",
    ", we examine the behavior of the condensates .",
    "if a condensate jumps discontinuously the transition is first - order , and this is indicated by a solid line . if its derivative has a discontinuity , the transition is second order , and this is indicated by a dotted line .",
    "if a condensate changes rapidly in a narrow range without vanishing there is a smooth cross - over , and this is indicated by a dashed - dotted line at the point were the condensate varies maximally .      in fig .",

    "@xcite ( see their fig .  1 ) , where color - superconducting phases were not taken into account . moreover , in ref",
    ".  @xcite different parameters were used , in addition to a form factor which mimics asymptotic freedom .     and @xmath103 as a function of @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",

    "one can clearly see that the phase diagram is symmetric under reflection in the origin .",
    "this is because the free energy is invariant under the transformation @xmath108 from the symmetry between particles and anti - particles .",
    "[ fig : muumudt0 ] is also symmetric under interchange of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , because of the choice of equal up and down quark masses .",
    "this gives rise to the symmetry of the phase boundaries with respect to the diagonals .",
    "in general , horizontal and vertical lines in the phase diagrams arise if the pairing of one type of quark is not changed after a transition . in this case",
    ", the location of the phase boundary is determined by the properties of other quarks .",
    "therefore , changing the chemical potential of the unchanged quark species can not have a big influence on the location of the phase boundary .",

    "although such situations are not necessarily realized in compact stars or can be realized in heavy - ion collisions , a comparison with future lattice data may nevertheless provide interesting information .",
    "this is especially relevant for pseudoscalar condensation in the phase where chiral symmetry is restored and also for the complicated superconductivity phase structure close to the cutoff of the model .",
    "this work can be extended in several ways .",
    "for example , one can take into account t hooft s instanton - induced interaction @xcite .",
    "if one has pseudoscalar condensation , this is more difficult than in the normal case .",
    "another useful extension would be the inclusion of the neutrality conditions  @xcite , in which case the phase structure changes and for instance gapless phases will occur .",
    "it would also be interesting to see how the results depend on the strength of the diquark coupling and also on the quark masses .",
    "furthermore , one could add the loff phase @xcite . in this crystalline phase",
    ", quarks of different momenta can pair .",
    "one could also include vector interactions . in this case",
    "spin-1 diquark condensation ( see for example refs.@xcite ) and an induced lorentz - symmetry breaking ( isb ) phase  @xcite are among the possibilities",
    ". it would also be worthwhile to take pseudoscalar diquark condensation @xcite into account .",
    "finally , one could try to go beyond the mean - field approximation as was done in ref .",
