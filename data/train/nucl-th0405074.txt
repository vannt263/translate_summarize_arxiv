    "the implications of present studies about nuclear double beta ( @xmath11 ) decay @xcite are far reaching in nature .",
    "the two neutrino double beta ( 2@xmath12 @xmath13 ) decay is a second order process of weak interaction and conserves the lepton number exactly .",
    "hence , it is allowed in the standard model of electroweak unification ( sm ) .",
    "the half - life of 2@xmath12 @xmath14 decay , which is a product of accurately known phase space factor and appropriate nuclear transition matrix element ( ntme ) @xmath9 , has been already measured for about ten nuclei out of 35 possible candidates .",
    "so , the values of ntme @xmath9 can be extracted directly .",
    "consequently , the validity of different models employed for nuclear structure calculations can be tested by calculating the @xmath9 .",
    "the neutrinoless double beta ( 0@xmath12 @xmath11 ) decay is a convenient tool to test physics beyond the sm .",
    "the experimental as well as theoretical aspect of nuclear @xmath11 decay have been widely reviewed over the past years [ 3 - 19 ] .",
    "klapdor and his group have recently reported that the 0@xmath12 @xmath11 decay has been observed in @xmath15ge .",
    "the results are controversial but it is expected that the issue will be settled soon @xcite .",
    "the aim of all the present experimental activities is to observe the 0@xmath12 @xmath11 decay .",
    "as the 0@xmath12 @xmath11 decay has not been observed so far , the nuclear models predict half - lives assuming certain value for the neutrino mass or conversely extract various parameters from the observed limits on half - lives of the 0@xmath12 @xmath11 decay .",
    "the reliability of predictions can be judged _ a priori _ only from the success of a nuclear model in explaining various observed physical properties of nuclei .",
    "the common practice is to calculate the @xmath9 to start with and compare with the experimentally observed value as the two decay modes involve the same set of initial and final nuclear wave functions .    in 2@xmath12 @xmath11 decay ,",
    "the total angular momentum of four _ s_-wave leptons can be 0 , 1 or 2 , and is equal to the total angular momentum transferred between the parent and daughter nuclei .",
    "the lowest 1@xmath16 state in the final nucleus of any @xmath11 decay candidate lies much higher in energy than the first excited 2@xmath16 state .",
    "hence , the 0@xmath171@xmath16 transition is much less probable than the 0@xmath170@xmath16 and 0@xmath182@xmath16 transitions . since",
    ", the 0@xmath172@xmath16 transition has not been detected up to now , the present theoretical predictions can only be checked against the 0@xmath170@xmath16 transition of 2@xmath12 @xmath11 decay . in all cases of the @xmath19 @xmath11 decay for 0@xmath170@xmath20 transition",
    ", it is observed that the ntmes @xmath9 are quenched , i.e. they are smaller than those predicted for pure quaisparticle transitions .",
    "the main objective of all nuclear structure calculations is to understand the physical mechanism responsible for the suppression of the @xmath21 .",
    "over the past few years , the @xmath9 has been calculated mainly in three types of models , namely the shell model and its variants , the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) and its extensions and the alternative models . in the recent past ,",
    "the details about these models -their advantages as well as shortcomings- have been discussed by suhonen _",
    "_ @xcite and faessler _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "the shell model attempts to solve the nuclear many - body problem as exactly as possible .",
    "hence , it is the best choice for the calculation of the ntmes .",
    "however , most of the @xmath11 decay emitters are medium or heavy mass nuclei for which the number of basis states increases quite drastically .",
    "few years back , it was not possible to perform a reliable shell - model calculation beyond the _ pf_-shell",
    ". hence , haxton and stephenson , jr .",
    "@xcite and vergados @xcite have studied the @xmath11decay of @xmath15ge , @xmath22se and @xmath23te  nuclei in weak coupling limit .",
    "recent large scale shell model calculations are more promising in nature @xcite . the calculations by caurier _",
    "_ are more realistic in which the @xmath9 of @xmath22se is calculated exactly and those of @xmath15ge and @xmath24xe are dealt in a nearly exact manner @xcite .",
    "the conventional shell model and monte - carlo shell model ( mcsm ) @xcite have been tested against each other in case of @xmath25ca and @xmath15ge and the agreement is interestingly good .",
    "hence , it is expected that the mcsm could be a good alternative to conventional shell model calculations in near future .",
    "vogel and zirnbauer were the first to provide an explanation of the observed suppression of @xmath9 in the qrpa model by a proper inclusion of ground state correlations through the proton - neutron _ p - p _ interaction in the _ _",
    "s__=1 , _ _",
    "t__=0 channel and the calculated half - lives are in close agreement with all the experimental data @xcite .",
    "the qrpa frequently overestimates the ground state correlations as a result of an increase in the strength of attractive proton - neutron interaction leading to the collapse of qrpa solutions .",
    "the physical value of this force is usually close to the point at which the qrpa solutions collapse . to cure the strong suppression of @xmath9 ,",
    "several extensions of qrpa have been proposed .",
    "the most important proposals are inclusion of proton - neutron pairing , renormalized qrpa , higher qrpa , multiple commutator method ( mcm ) and particle number projection . however , none of the above methods is free from ambiguities @xcite .",
    "alternative models , as the operator expansion method ( oem ) , the broken su(4 ) symmetry , two vacua rpa , the pseudo su(3 ) and the single state dominance hypothesis ( ssdh ) have their own problems @xcite .",
    "the basic aim of nuclear many body theory is to describe as much observed properties of nuclei as possible in a coherent frame .",
    "the @xmath11 decay can be studied in the same framework of many other nuclear properties and decays . over the past years",
    ", a vast amount of data has been collected through experimental studies involving in - beam @xmath26-ray spectroscopy concerning the level energies as well as electromagnetic properties .",
    "the availability of data permits a rigorous and detailed critique of the ingredients of the microscopic framework that seeks to provide a description of nuclear @xmath11 decay .",
    "however , most of the calculations of @xmath11 decay matrix elements performed so far do not satisfy this criterion .",
    "our aim is to study the 2@xmath12 @xmath11 decay of @xmath27zr , @xmath28mo , @xmath29ru and @xmath8pd isotopes for @xmath4 transition not in isolation but together with other observed nuclear phenomena .",
    "the 2@xmath12 @xmath11 decay of @xmath30mo along with the spectroscopic properties has been already studied in the projected hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( phfb ) model using the closure approximation @xcite . in the present calculation , we have avoided the closure approximation by making use of the summation method @xcite .",
    "further , the hfb wave function of @xmath30mo are generated with improved accuracy .",
    "the structure of nuclei in the mass region _ _ a__@xmath31100 involving zr , mo , ru , pd and cd isotopes is quite complex . with the discovery of a new region of deformation around _ _",
    "a__= 100 by cheifetz _",
    "@xcite , a well developed rotational spectra was observed in several neutron rich mo and ru isotopes during a study of fission fragments of @xmath32cf .",
    "the @xmath33:@xmath34 values were observed to be as enhanced as in the rare - earth and actinide regions .",
    "this mass region offered a nice example of shape transition , the sudden onset of deformation at neutron number _ _ n__=60 .",
    "the nuclei are soft vibrators for neutron number @xmath35 60 and quasi - rotors for @xmath36 60 .",
    "the nuclei with neutron number _",
    "_ n__=60 are transitional nuclei .",
    "thus , in this mass region @xmath30zr , @xmath37mo , @xmath38ru and @xmath39pd are observed to be transitional cases . in case of cd isotopes",
    ", similar shape transition occurs at _ _ a__=100 .",
    "hence , it is expected that deformation will play a crucial role in reproducing the properties of nuclei in this mass region _ _ a__@xmath31100 .",
    "moreover , it has been already conjectured that the deformation can play a crucial role in case of @xmath11 decay of @xmath30mo and @xmath40nd @xcite .",
    "further , all the nuclei undergoing @xmath11 decay are even - even type , in which the pairing degrees of freedom play an important role .",
    "hence , it is desirable to have a model which incorporates the pairing and deformation degrees of freedom on equal footing in its formalism . for this purpose ,",
    "the phfb model is one of the most natural choices .    over the past twenty years , extensive studies of shape transition vis - a - vis electromagnetic properties of zr and mo isotopes have been successfully carried out in the phfb model @xcite using the pairing plus quadrupole - quadrupole ( ppqq ) interaction @xcite .",
    "the success of the phfb model in explaining the observed experimental trends in the mass region _ _",
    "a__@xmath31100 motivated us to apply the hfb wave functions to study the nuclear 2@xmath12 @xmath11 decay of @xmath30mo@xmath41 @xmath30ru for 0@xmath170@xmath16 transition .",
    "further , the success of the phfb model in conjunction with the ppqq interaction in explaining the yrast spectra , reduced transition probabilities @xmath33:@xmath42 , static quadrupole moments @xmath43 , @xmath44-factors @xmath45 of @xmath30mo and @xmath30ru nuclei as well as the @xmath46(0@xmath170@xmath20 ) of @xmath30mo @xcite has prompted us to apply the phfb model to study the 2@xmath12 @xmath11 decay of some nuclei namely @xmath27zr , @xmath47mo , @xmath29ru and @xmath8pd for 0@xmath170@xmath16 transition in the mass range 94@xmath48__a__@xmath48110 .",
    "it is well known that the pairing part of the interaction ( _ p _ ) accounts for the sphericity of nucleus , whereas the quadrupole - quadrupole ( _ qq _ ) interaction increases the collectivity in the nuclear intrinsic wave functions and makes the nucleus deformed .",
    "hence , the phfb model using the ppqq interaction is a convenient choice to examine the explicit role of deformation on ntmes @xmath49 in case of @xmath30mo for 0@xmath180@xmath16 transition , we have observed that the deformation plays an important role in reproducing a realistic @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have also studied the variation of @xmath9 vis - a - vis the change in deformation through the changing strength of the _ qq _ interaction .",
