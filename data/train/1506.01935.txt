    "this inverse problem is to know whether the knowledge of @xmath20 , can uniquely determine the electric time dependent potential @xmath2 .",

    "these results are concerned in the case where the dirichlet - to - neumann map is considered in the whole boundary .",
    "a key ingredient in the existing results , is the construction of complex geometric optics solutions concentrating near lines with any direction @xmath24 and the relationship between the hyperbolic dirichlet - to - neumann map and the x - ray transform plays a crucial role .",

    "it s clear that with zero initial data one can not hope to recover @xmath0 over the whole domain @xmath33 , even from the knowledge of the full boundary operator @xmath20 .",
    "this is due to the domain of dependence associated to the hyperbolic problem ( [ eq1.1 ] ) ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , in isakov @xcite , the ideas from @xcite-@xcite are used to prove a uniqueness result in determining @xmath0 over the whole domain @xmath33 , but he needed much more information .",

    "<S> we study the stability in the inverse problem of determining the time dependent zeroth - order coefficient @xmath0 arising in the wave equation , from boundary observations . </S>",
    "<S> we derive , in dimension @xmath1 , a log - type stability estimate in the determination of @xmath2 from the dirichlet - to - neumann map , in a subset of our domain assuming that it is known outside this subset . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we prove that we can extend this result to the determination of @xmath2 in a larger region , and then in the whole domain provided that we have much more data . + * keywords : * inverse problems , dirichlet - to - neumann map , wave equation , bounded domain , time dependent potential , x - ray transform , stability estimate . </S>"
