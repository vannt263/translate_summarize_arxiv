    "@xcite a uniaxial magnetic anisotropy , @xmath47 with @xmath48 being the polar angle of the magnetization at site @xmath7 , adds @xmath49 per unit cell to the energy of such a spin - spiral , while -@xmath50 to that of the fm state of minimal energy .",
    "note that for @xmath24% relaxation of the fe layer we calculated @xmath51  mev being considerably smaller than the leading isotropic exchange and dm interactions .",
    "neglecting on - site anisotropy , a maximum of the eigenvalues of @xmath44 at the center of the brillouin zone , i.e. at the @xmath52 point thus means a ferromagnetic ground state , whilst a maximum located at a general @xmath45 vector of the brillouin zone corresponds to a more complex magnetic ground state . for all considered fe layer relaxations , the maximum was found close to the @xmath52 anticipating a spin - spiral ground state of large wave length .",
    "from the spin - dynamics simulations we obtained a spin - spiral ground state in accordance with the estimation based on @xmath44 .",
    "the estimated wave length from the maximum eigenvalue of @xmath44 and the wave length obtained from the spin - dynamics simulations are in remarkably good agreement with each other , similarly as found in the fe / os(0001 ) system.@xcite as can be seen in table [ tab : wave ] , the wave length of the spin - spiral ( @xmath53 ) decreases with increasing inward layer relaxation .",
    "this can be correlated with the ratio of the magnitude of the nearest neighbor dm vectors and the isotropic exchange interaction ( @xmath0 ) also presented in table [ tab : wave ] .",
    "there is almost an inverse proportionality between @xmath53 and @xmath0 as can be obtained from a simple analytic estimation in the small wave number limit.@xcite it should be noted that for @xmath24% relaxation , which is the energetically favored geometry from the vasp method , the calculated wave length of 6.8 nm is in excellent agreement with the experimentally measured spin - spiral period of about 6 to 7 nm .",

    "[ diameter ] , for all considered layer relaxations we summarized the determined skyrmion diameters , @xmath62 , the smallest inter - skyrmion distances , @xmath63 , and the external magnetic fields , @xmath64 , where the skyrmion number is the largest .",
    "note that @xmath63 is defined as the distance between the center of the skyrmions .",
    "as can be seen , the skyrmion diameter is decreasing with increased inward layer relaxation and correspondingly increased @xmath0 , similarly as found for the wave length of the spin - spiral , see table [ tab : wave ] .",
    "interestingly , for larger relaxations the spin - spiral wave length and the skyrmion diameter take very similar values .",
    "moreover , we find that for increasing relaxations the packing of the skyrmion lattice increases : in case of @xmath65 relaxation the smallest inter - skyrmion distance is considerably larger than the diameter of the skyrmions , while for @xmath66 relaxation @xmath67 .",
    "it is also clearly seen in table [ diameter ] that @xmath64 is increasing with increasing inward layer relaxation , i.e. with decreasing skyrmion size .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ spindin ] the simulated spin - configurations for the spin - spiral ground states ( @xmath68 ) and the skyrmion lattice at @xmath64 are presented for @xmath24% and @xmath25% fe layer relaxations .",
    "noteworthy , the ss ground states are characterized by a strong domain structure which is the consequence of the three - fold degeneracy of the @xmath45 wave vectors of the ground state spin - spirals . it can be noticed that in case of larger size of the skyrmions ( @xmath24% relaxation ) , the high - density skyrmion phase is rather loosely ordered and for small skyrmions ( @xmath25% relaxation ) a well  ordered skyrmion lattice develops , see also the @xmath63 values in table [ diameter ] .",
    "the origin of the less ordered sk phase can be purely numerical , as the diameter of the skyrmions is not compatible with the size of the lattice used for the simulation . it is , however , not excluded that this difference can partly be related to different skyrmion - skyrmion interactions , posing a challenging topic for future research .",
    "moreover , one can observe that the area of ferromagnetically ordered spins is much larger for larger sizes of the skyrmions , being a simple space - filling effect .",
    "this makes the more relaxed ( @xmath25% ) film more rigid against applied external fields which explains the larger range of @xmath69 seen in fig .",
    "[ sknum ] .",
    "we investigated the magnetic ground state of pdfe / ir(111 ) at different inward layer relaxations and the evolution of the magnetic ground state in external magnetic field .",
    "we employed the sce - rdlm method to obtain spin - model parameters and performed spin - dynamic simulations .",
    "we found that the magnetic ground state without external magnetic field is a spin - spiral in all considered inward layer relaxations .",
    "the wave length of the spin - spiral is decreasing with increasing inward layer relaxation due to the increasing ratio of the nearest neighbor dm vector and the isotropic exchange coupling , @xmath0 . applying external magnetic field ,",
    "skyrmions are created in the system .",
    "based on energy calculations of spin configurations in external magnetic field we obtained good agreement for the phase boundaries with available experiments . numerically evaluating the skyrmion numbers in spin - dynamics simulations we identified different magnetic phases depending on the magnetic field .",
    "we found that the skyrmion diameter and the smallest inter - skyrmion distances decrease with increasing inward layer relaxation and larger external fields are needed to stabilize such skyrmion lattices .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the size of skyrmions and the stabilizing external field can be tuned by manipulating the geometrical structure of the film , e.g. through applying external mechanical strain or electric field or alloying the substrate.@xcite    this work was supported by the hungarian scientific research fund projects k84078 and pd83353 , and in part by the european union under fp7 contract no . nmp3-sl-2012 - 281043 femtospin .",
