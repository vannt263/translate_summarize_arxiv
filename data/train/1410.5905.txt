    "a new class of non - equilibrium particle systems of two species that interact with each other along a hypersurface is recently introduced in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the primary goal is to understand the connection between the microscopic transports of positive and negative charges in solar cells and the electric current generated .",
    "however , these models are flexible and general enough to provide insight to a variety of natural phenomena , such as the population dynamics of two segregated species under competition .",
    "here is an informal description of the model introduced in @xcite .",
    "a solar cell is modeled by a domain in @xmath0 that is divided into two adjacent sub - domains @xmath1 and @xmath2 by an interface @xmath3 , a @xmath4-dimensional lipschitz hypersurface .",
    "domains @xmath1 and @xmath2 represent the hybrid medium that confine the positive and the negative charges , respectively . an example to keep in mind",
    "is when @xmath5 and @xmath6 are two adjacent unit cubes .",
    "the interface is then @xmath7 .",
    "the particle system is indexed by @xmath8 , the initial number of positive and negative charges in each of @xmath1 and @xmath2 . at microscopic level ,",
    "the motion of positive and negative charges are modeled by independent reflected diffusions ( such as reflected brownian motions ) in @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively . besides",
    ", there is a harvest region @xmath9 that absorbs ( harvests ) @xmath10 charges , respectively , whenever it is being visited .",
    "furthermore , when two particles of different types are within a small distance @xmath11 , they disappear at a certain rate if the time of occurrence is an exponential random variable of parameter @xmath12 . in particular , the probability of occurrence in a short amount of time @xmath13 is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 as @xmath16 . ]",
    "this annihilation models the trapping , recombination and separation phenomena of the charges .",
    "we shall refer to the system just described as the _ annihilating diffusion model_. see figure [ fig : model3clean ] for an illustration .",
    "is the interface and @xmath18 are harvest sites , title=\"fig:\"][fig : model3clean ]    even though the boundary is fixed and there is no creation of particles , the interactions do affect the correlations among the particles : whether or not a positive particle disappears at a given time affects the empirical distribution of the negative particles , which in term affects that of the positive particles .",
    "this challenge is reflected by the non - linearity of the macroscopic limit .",
    "this challenge arises again in the study of its fluctuation limit , and it is further reflected by the boundary integral term in the covariance of the gaussian process ; see of theorem [ t : convergence_annihilatingsystem ] .",
    "in @xcite , we established a _ functional law of large numbers _ for the time trajectory of the particle densities .",
    "this is a first step in connecting the microscopic mechanism of the system with the macroscopic behaviors that emerge .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath19 be the pair of empirical measure of positive and negative charges at time @xmath13 .",
    "we showed that , under a suitable scaling and appropriate conditions on the initial configurations , the random pairs of measures @xmath19 converge in distribution , as @xmath20 , to a pair of deterministic measures which are absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure .",
    "furthermore , the densities with respect to lebesque measure satisfy a system of partial differential equations ( pdes ) that has coupled nonlinear boundary conditions on the interface ; see theorem [ t : conjecture_delta_n_clt ] .",
    "it is this nonlinear coupling effect near the interface that distinguishes this model from previously studied ones .",
    "the suitable scaling is of order @xmath21 and is rigorously formulated via the annihilation potential function in assumption [ a : the annihilation potentialclt ] .    in the current work ,",
    "we look at a finer scale of the annihilating diffusion model and establish the _ functional central limit theorem _ in theorem [ t : convergence_annihilatingsystem ] .",
    "to focus on the fluctuation effect caused by the interaction on the interface @xmath3 , we assume the harvest sites are empty in this paper .",
    "the fluctuations of the empirical measures from their mean ( the coupled pdes ) is quantified by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the integral of an observable ( or test function ) @xmath24 with respect to the measure @xmath25 .",
    "intuitively , if @xmath26 is an indicator function of a subset @xmath27 , then @xmath28 is the mass of particles in @xmath29 ( which is the number of particles in @xmath29 divided by @xmath8 ) . in this case",
    ", @xmath30 is the fluctuation of the mass of particles in @xmath29 at time @xmath13 .",
    "our main result in this paper , theorem [ t : convergence_annihilatingsystem ] , asserts that the fluctuation limit ( as @xmath20 ) is a continuous gaussian markov process whose covariance structure is explicitly characterized .",
    "roughly speaking , the limit solves a stochastic partial differential equation ( spde ) which is a nonlinear version of the langevin equation .    as a preliminary step to understand the fluctuation for the annihilating diffusion model , we consider in @xcite a simpler single species model . in that paper ,",
    "the particles move as i.i.d .",
    "reflected brownian motions in a bounded domain @xmath31 and are killed by a singular time - dependent potential which concentrates on the boundary @xmath32 .",
    "this is motivated by observation that we can view the positive charges as reflected diffusions in @xmath1 subject to killings by a time - dependent random potential .",
    "the techniques developed in @xcite provides us with a functional analytic setting for our fluctuation processes @xmath33 and allow us to overcome some ( but not all ) challenges for the study of the fluctuation of the annihilating diffusion model .",
    "for the latter , we need two new ingredients , namely the _ asymptotic expansion of the correlation functions _ and the _ boltzman - gibbs principle_. more precisely , by generalizing the approach of p. dittrich @xcite , we show that the correlation functions have the decomposition @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the hydrodynamic limit of the interacting diffusion system , @xmath36 is an explicit function and @xmath37 is a term converging to zero as @xmath8 tends to infinity .",
    "see theorem [ t : asymptotic_nm_correlation_t ] for the precise statement .",
    "this result implies propagation of chaos and allows explicit calculations of the covariance of the fluctuation process .",
    "the proof of theorem [ t : asymptotic_nm_correlation_t ] is based on a comparison of the bbgky hierarchy satisfied by the correlation functions with two other approximating hierarchies . on the other hand , the boltzman - gibbs principle ,",
    "first formulated mathematically and proven for some zero range processes in equilibrium in @xcite , says that the fluctuation fields of non - conserved quantities change on a time scale much faster than the conserved ones , hence in a time integral only the component along those fields of conserved quantities survives .",
    "although this principle is proved to hold for a few non - equilibrium situations ( see @xcite and the references therein ) , it is not known whether it holds in general .",
    "the validity of the principle for our annihilating diffusion model is far from obvious , since there is no conserved quantity .",
    "an intuitive explanation for the validity here is as follow : assumption [ a : shrinkingrateclt ] guarantees that the interaction near @xmath3 changes the occupation number of the particles at a slower rate with respect to diffusion ( which conserves the particle number ) . in other words , the particle number is approximately conserved on the time scale that is relevant for the principle .",
    "hence we are not far away from equilibrium fluctuation .",
    "one of the earliest rigorous results on fluctuation limit was proven by it @xcite , who considered a system of independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) brownian motions in @xmath0 and showed that the limit is a @xmath38-valued gaussian process solving a langevin equation , where @xmath38 is the schwartz space of tempered distributions .",
    "fluctuations for interacting diffusions in @xmath0 are studied by various authors ; see @xcite for examples of gaussian fluctuations and @xcite for an example of non - gaussian fluctuations .",
    "sznitman @xcite studied the fluctuations of a conservative system of diffusions with normal reflected boundary conditions on smooth domains .",
    "it is well known that the correlation method works well for certain stochastic particle systems modeling the reaction - diffusion equation @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the reaction term , such as a polynomial in @xmath41 .",
    "see @xcite for the continuous setting in which particles are diffusions on the cube @xmath42^d$ ] with linear or quadratic reaction terms .",
    "see also @xcite for the discrete setting in which particles move on a one - dimensional lattice and correlations functions are called @xmath43-functions .",
    "the key message of the fluctuation results for the reaction - diffusion equation is that , roughly speaking , the fluctuation limit @xmath44 solves the following _ stochastic partial differential equation _ in a distributional hilbert space : @xmath45 where @xmath46 solves equation , @xmath47 is the derivative of @xmath40 ( e.g. @xmath48 when @xmath49 ) and is viewed as a multiplicative operator , @xmath50 is a gaussian martingale with independent increment and covariance structure @xmath51=\\int_0^t\\<|\\nabla\\phi|^2,\\,u(s)\\>+\\<\\phi^2,\\,|r(u(s))|\\>\\,ds.\\ ] ] here @xmath52 is the @xmath53 inner product in the spatial variable and @xmath54 is the polynomial obtained by putting an absolute sign to each coefficient in @xmath40 .",
    "so the transportation component ( or drift ) @xmath55 of the fluctuation limit involves the derivative of the reaction term .    for our annihilating diffusion model , it is not clear which function should one `` differentiate '' with respect to for the nonlinear term in the hydrodynamic limit , since it involves two functions .",
    "it turns out that the transportation component of our fluctuation limit @xmath56 in theorem [ t : convergence_annihilatingsystem ] is described by ( [ e : fluctuationpde_limit ] ) , which is another coupled pde which can be view as a ` linearization ' of the hydrodynamic equation in theorem [ t : conjecture_delta_n_clt ] .",
    "our fluctuation results hold for all dimensions @xmath57 .",
    "a distinct feature is that the covariance structures of our fluctuation limits have boundary integral terms that capture the boundary interactions at the fluctuation level , in addition to the usual energy terms that describe the spatial motion of the particles .",
    "for the convenience of the reader , we list our notations used in this paper .
