    "the extended medium sensitivity survey  ( * ? ? ? * emss ) sparked renewed interest in the ongoing search for clusters of galaxies at high redshift .",
    "since then , numerous high redshift surveys have been carried out , both optically  ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "* and others ) , and in the x - ray  ( * ? ? ?",

    "* and others ) .",
    "the motivations for such searches are multifaceted , but the most compelling of these are cosmological in nature .",
    "clusters of galaxies are an important source of information about the underlying cosmology of the universe .",
    "they are considered to be essentially `` closed boxes '' , meaning that the primordial matter that they were initially assembled from has remained trapped in their deep potential wells since they were formed .",
    "this makes them ideal objects with which to study galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "in addition , clusters are the largest virialized objects in the universe . by virtue of this fact we are able to , through high redshift samples , investigate the growth of large scale structure .",
    "a firm knowledge of the evolution of the cluster mass function would provide an enormous contribution to constraining cosmological parameters such as @xmath11 ( the normalization of the density perturbation spectrum ) and @xmath12  ( the dark energy equation of state ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "two ingredients are required to achieve this goal .",
    "first , a statistically significant sample of clusters in multiple redshift bins is needed .",
    "second , reliable mass estimates of the clusters in that sample must be obtained . difficulties in reaching",
    "the first requirement include the vast amount of telescope time required to carry out such a search in the x - ray , and the propensity for false detections due to projection effects in optical surveys .",
    "the primary challenge in reaching the second part of this goal is again the high cost of observing time to achieve either x - ray or dynamical mass estimates .",
    "the red - sequence cluster survey  ( rcs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has attempted to evade such difficulties  rcs is an optical survey which uses the color - magnitude relationship of cluster ellipticals to find galactic overdensities in small slices of redshift space .",
    "this technique has been estimated to bring false detection rates down to @xmath13  @xcite . the chosen filters ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) , optimize this finding algorithm for the redshift range @xmath16 and provide photometric redshift information with accuracies of @xmath17 .",
    "in addition , optical richness information is immediately available from the survey data and , if sufficiently calibrated , this information could provide a highly efficient way to estimate the masses of cluster candidates .",
    "the first phase of the red - sequence cluster survey  ( rcs-1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , from which our cluster sample was drawn , covers 90 square degrees and was performed at cfht and ctio .",
    "rcs-1 has identified 6483 cluster candidates in the redshift range @xmath18 , over 1000 of which are at least as optically rich as abell class 0 clusters  @xcite .",
    "the motivations for this work are to characterize high - redshift optically - selected cluster samples , probe cluster evolution , and move forward in attempts to calibrate a robust relationship between optical richness and cluster mass .",
    "this paper presents a detailed analysis of the _ chandra _ data of thirteen rcs-1 clusters with redshifts in the range @xmath19 our analysis investigates the temperatures and gas distributions of ten of these clusters , and provides mass estimates for use in the calibration of relationships between optical richness and cluster mass .",

    "_ chandra _ advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) observations of thirteen rcs clusters were taken during the period 10 april 2002 - 23 october 2005 .",

    "seven of the clusters in this sample were observed on multiple occasions .",
    "all multiple observations were merged for imaging analysis to provide higher overall signal - to - noise ratios . those clusters with @xmath27 months between observations were merged for spectral analysis as well .",
    "each of the observations analyzed in this study possesses a focal plane temperature of @xmath28 c.    aspect solutions were examined for irregularities and none was found",
    ". background contamination due to charged particle flares was reduced by removing time intervals during which the background rate exceeded the average background rate by more than @xmath29 .",
    "the quiescent background was further reduced by using vfaint mode .",

    "after the initial cleaning of each data set , 0.3 - 7.0 kev images , instrument maps , and exposure maps were created using the ciao 3.3.0.1 tool merge_all .",
    "data with energies below 0.3 kev and above 7.0 kev were excluded due to uncertainties in the acis calibration and background contamination , respectively . ideally , all data below 0.6 kev would have been excluded to minimize low energy uncertainties ; however , the combined faintness and high redshifts of our objects require the utilization of lower energy photons as well .",
    "point source detection was performed by running the tools wtransform and wrecon on the flux images .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] contains smoothed 0.3 - 7.0 kev _",
    "chandra _ flux images of each of the clusters in our sample ( produced by the ciao tool csmooth ) , including a combined image of the three objects at @xmath30 which belong to a supercluster in the 23h field  @xcite .",
    "as seen in the figure , this sample covers a wide range of cluster x - ray morphology , from very regular objects ( e.g. , rcs1419 + 5326 ) , through well - detected clusters with significant substructure ( e.g. , rcs2318 + 0034 ) , all the way to very disturbed systems ( e.g. , rcs2112 - 6326 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that in figure  [ fig1 ] , the brightest part of rcs2318 + 0034 does not seem to lie at the center of the cluster , indicating that this object may have recently undergone a merger , or could at least possess an appreciable amount of substructure .",
    "together , these clusters represent an assembly of some of the richest high-@xmath7 ( @xmath19 ) clusters in the rcs-1 survey .",
    "to estimate the significance of rcs cluster detections in the x - ray , we made use of relatively simple statistics .",
    "counts were extracted from a 500 @xmath31 kpc radius region around the aimpoint of each observation in the 0.3 - 7.0 kev band ( @xmath32 ) , and also from a region far away from the aimpoint on the same chip which served as a background ( @xmath33 ) .",

    "signal - to - noise ratios were calculated based on dividing net counts , @xmath34 , by the standard deviation , @xmath35 . using this method ,",
    "twelve cluster signals were detected at a signal - to - noise ratio greater than @xmath36 , with the remaining object detected at s / n@xmath37 ( table  [ table2 ] ) .",
    "using adaptively smoothed 0.3 - 7.0 kev flux images ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) , we determined the location of the x - ray emission peak of each cluster .",
    "the images of rcs2112 - 6326 and rcs2156 - 0448 appear to contain multiple regions of extended emission , therefore we can not determine a precise x - ray position for these objects .",
    "in the case of rcs1326 + 2903 , two rcs 13h clusters lie in the field of view .",
    "the original observation was designed to observe a @xmath38 cluster at an ra , dec of 13:26:29 , + 29:03:06 ( j2000 ) .",
    "our astrometry indicates , however , that we are most likely detecting the emission of a lower redshift rcs cluster ( @xmath39 ) at an optical position of 13:26:31 , + 29:03:12 .",
    "because of the uncertainty surrounding this detection , we have carried both possibilities throughout much of our analysis ; however , we include the more likely candidate ( at @xmath39 ) in our subsequent fitting and plots .",
    "all other clusters ( with the exceptions of rcs2112 - 6326 and rcs2156 - 0448 ) were found within @xmath40 of their optical positions .",
    "table  [ table2 ] lists optical positions , x - ray positions , net counts within 500 @xmath31 kpc , and signal - to - noise ratios derived from the method described above .",
    "a radial surface brightness profile was computed over the range 0.3 - 7.0 kev in circular annuli for each cluster .",
    "these profiles were then fit with @xmath2 models :    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is a constant representing the surface brightness contribution of the background , @xmath43 is the normalization and @xmath44 is the core radius .",
    "the parameters of the best fitting models of the ten clusters for which surface brightness fitting was possible are shown in table [ table3 ] , and images of these fits are given in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "though many of the clusters exhibit hints of substructure , most were reasonably well fit by a @xmath2 model ( see table  [ table3 ] for goodness of fit data ) .",
    "other than somewhat low normalizations , the results of surface brightness fitting are unremarkable ( @xmath45 ) , except in the two cases of rcs1326 + 2903 ( @xmath46 ) , which lies at the edge of our detection threshold ( table  [ table2 ] ) , and rcs2318 + 0034 which appears to not be completely relaxed , as its brightest emission is slightly offset from the center of its extended emission ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "spectra were extracted from each point - source - removed event file in a circular region with a @xmath47 radius . in the cases of rcs0224 - 0002 and rcs1419 + 5326 ( @xmath48 yr ) , individual spectra were extracted from each obsid and fit simultaneously .",
    "the spectra were analyzed with xspec  @xcite , using weighted response matrices ( rmfs ) and effective area files ( arfs ) generated with the ciao tool specextract and caldb 3.2.2 .",
    "background spectra were extracted from the aimpoint chip as far away from the aimpoint as possible .",
    "spectra were fitted with single temperature spectral models , inclusive of foreground absorption .",
    "each spectrum was fit with the absorbing column frozen at its measured value  @xcite .",
    "metal abundances were initially fixed at a value of 0.3 solar  @xcite .",
    "data with energies below 0.3 kev and above 7.0 kev were excluded from the fits .",
    "three of the clusters did not possess enough counts to constrain a spectral fit .",
    "the results of the ten successful fits , combined with best fitting @xmath2 model parameters from section  [ s : sb2 ] , were then used to estimate the value of @xmath3 for each cluster .",
    "this is accomplished by combining the equation for total gravitating mass  @xcite    @xmath49    ( where @xmath50 is the mean mass per particle ) with the definition of mass overdensity    @xmath51    where @xmath7 is the cluster redshift , and @xmath52 is the factor by which the density at @xmath53 exceeds @xmath54 , the critical density at @xmath7 . here @xmath54 is given by @xmath55 , where @xmath56^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "these equations are then combined with the density profile implied from the @xmath2 model ( assuming hydrostatic equilibrium , spherical symmetry , and isothermality )    @xmath57^{-3\\beta/2 } , \\label{eq : dens_eq}\\ ] ]    resulting in the equation    @xmath58}-1 } , \\label{eq : ettori}\\ ] ]    @xcite .    after the initial estimation of @xmath59 , additional spectra were extracted from within that radius , and spectral fitting",
    "was performed again .",
    "this procedure was repeated until temperatures and values of @xmath59 were consistent for a given spectrum .",
    "where statistically possible , additional fits were performed allowing abundances to vary also .",
    "redshifts were also fit ( allowing only @xmath7 , @xmath4 , and normalization to vary ) for the three clusters in our sample that do not have spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "we were unable to constrain a redshift for rcs1326 + 2903 .",
    "the fits of the other two clusters resulted in @xmath60 for rcs1419 + 5326 , and @xmath61 for rcs2318 + 0034 , within 10% and 14% ( respectively ) of photometric redshift estimates obtained using the color of the red sequence  @xcite .",
    "fits with redshift fixed at these values were used in subsequent analysis ( table  [ table4 ] ) .",
    "the small uncertainties in these values ( @xmath62 ) do not substantially affect our analysis .    unabsorbed 2 - 10 kev luminosities within r@xmath63 were calculated using fixed abundance fits .",
    "these were then converted to bolometric luminosities by scaling , using a thermal emission model in pimms .",
    "for the three clusters for which spectral temperature fitting was impossible ( rcs1417 + 5305 , rcs2112 - 6326 , and rcs2157 - 0448 ) , spectra were extracted within @xmath64 radii , and fit in xspec with temperatures fixed at 4 kev ( slightly lower than the average tx of the sample ) to determine their luminosities .",
    "temperature uncertainties of @xmath65 kev were folded into the errors of these estimates . to estimate @xmath66 ) , we extracted spectra from within that radius for the ten clusters in our detailed analysis sample and again used fixed abundance fits , with temperatures also fixed at the r@xmath63 value . the results of spectral fitting are shown in table  [ table4 ] , along with 68% confidence ranges .",
    "bolometric x - ray luminosities are listed with richness measurements in table  [ table5 ] .",
    "velocity dispersions for three of the clusters in this sample were obtained from  @xcite and  @xcite , and are listed in table  [ table6 ] . using the @xmath68 relationship of  @xcite : @xmath69",
    ", we find that our temperatures are in agreement with the clusters measured velocity dispersions in all cases ( table  [ table6 ] ) .",
    "this result indicates that these three systems , at least , are not overly disturbed .",
    "an isothermal cluster whose surface brightness is well fit by a @xmath2 model can be shown to have a gas density profile which follows equation  [ eq : dens_eq ] . using this relationship and the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium ( equation  [ mass_eq ] ) , total mass can be determined via    @xmath70    to estimate gas mass ( again assuming hydrostatic equilibrum , isothermality and sphericity ) , the first step is to obtain a central density ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "there are two complementary ways to go about this .",
    "one is to use the surface brightness normalization :    @xmath72^{1/2},\\ ] ]    where the @xmath73 function results from surface brightness integration , @xmath2 comes from the fit to surface brightness , @xmath74 is the mean atomic mass per free electron ( 0.62 ) , @xmath75 is the hydrogen mass fraction ( 0.707 ) , @xmath76 is the gas emissivity , @xmath77 is the best fitting surface brightness normalization ( corrected for absorption ) , and @xmath78 is the core radius .",
    "a second method of estimating central density makes use of both imaging and spectral fitting :    @xmath79    here k is the normalization of the xspec model and @xmath80 is the emission integral , estimated by integrating the ( spherical ) emission from the source out to some radius - in our case we use 10 mpc following the method of  @xcite .    for the rcs sample we employed both of these methods , as it was crucial to confirm that we were not underestimating central density in these comparatively low luminosity objects .",
    "we also added the data from our previous _",
    "analysis of the moderate redshift cnoc sample , to cover a wider range of redshifts in our comparison .",
    "we found that the methods agree ( on average ) to within 10% , and proceeded in our analysis using the surface brightness normalization method .    from these equations , along with equations  [ eq : dens_eq ] and  [ eq : ettori ] , and using the results of spectral and surface brightness fitting , gas masses and total masses were determined out to @xmath3 and @xmath6 for the clusters in this sample .",
    "we also calculate gas mass fractions for the rcs clusters and find them to be systematically lower than the gas fractions of lower redshift x - ray selected clusters .",
    "the robustness and implications of this result are explored in detail in section  [ fgas ] .",
    "gas masses , total masses , and gas mass fractions can be found in tables  [ table7 ] and  [ table8 ] .",
    "we note that while extrapolations to larger radii are possible using out measured @xmath2-fit parameters , r@xmath63 is the radius to which we have confident measures for our entire sample .",
    "studying the relationships between global cluster properties ( l@xmath81 , t@xmath81 , m@xmath82 , etc . ) over a broad range in redshift allows us to investigate the influence of non - gravitational processes on cluster formation and evolution . on a less grand scale",
    ", these relationships can also lead to interesting clues regarding an individual cluster s dynamical state and composition , as well as provide a method of comparison between different cluster samples . in this paper",
    "we investigate the evolution of scaling relationships over the redshift range @xmath83 , and use them to characterize high-@xmath7 optically - selected rcs clusters ( @xmath84 )    to facilitate comparisons between the rcs clusters and lower - redshift x - ray selected samples , we make use of our previous _ chandra _ analysis of the canadian network for observational cosmology ( cnoc ) subsample of the extended medium sensitivity survey ( emss )  @xcite .",
    "the cnoc sample was assembled primarily based on x - ray luminosity , with a cut at @xmath85 erg s@xmath22 in the original emss catalogs  @xcite , and covers a redshift range of @xmath20 .",
    "this sample is not well - matched in redshift to our rcs clusters , but it is one of the best - studied moderate - redshift cluster samples today , with substantial information about both x - ray and optical properties available .",
    "our previous analysis of this sample using the same methodology  @xcite also allows us to make a confident comparison of our measurements .",
    "all relationships ( @xmath5-@xmath4 , @xmath86m@xmath82 , m@xmath87 , @xmath5-@xmath88 , and m@xmath89 ) are fit within either r@xmath63 or r@xmath90 , have been scaled by the cosmological factor @xmath91^{1/2}$ ] and are fit with the form    @xmath92    in all relationships @xmath4 is in units of 5 kev , @xmath5 in units of @xmath93 erg s@xmath22 , total mass in @xmath94 , and @xmath88(@xmath95 ) in @xmath96 kev .",

    ".    in all fits the cluster rcs0439 - 2904 was left out , due to spectroscopic indications  @xcite that it does not consist of a single virialized mass but two closely spaced objects in projection along the line of sight .",
    "we perform fits at @xmath98 on the individual samples ; rcs ( @xmath99 ) and cnoc ( @xmath100 ) , as well as combined data from all 23 clusters ( @xmath101 ) . at @xmath102",
    "only the rcs data are fit .",
    "all fits are then reproduced with the slope fixed at the expected self - similar value .",
    "the following discussions pertain to fits with two free parameters unless otherwise noted .",
    "results from the fitting performed in this section can be found in table  [ table9 ] , while table  [ table10 ] provides comparison fits from the literature .      in the absence of significant preheating and/or cooling",
    ", theory predicts that cluster luminosities should scale as @xmath104 .",
    "however , observational studies have resulted in relationships which fall closer to @xmath105  @xcite .",
    "these departures from theoretically expected self - similar scaling laws indicate the effects of non - gravitational processes , such as galaxy formation  @xcite .",
    "there is also interest in whether the @xmath5-@xmath4 relationship evolves with redshift  @xcite , which we investigate in this section along with the properties of our sample .",
    "the best fitting relationships and their scatter are given in table  [ table9 ] and are plotted in figure  [ fig3 ] . at both radii ( r@xmath63 and r@xmath90 ) , the slope of the rcs fit is found to be consistent with a predicted self - similar slope of 2 .",
    "the cnoc sample , with a slope of @xmath106 , is only marginally consistent with predicted scaling , but does agree with other low - redshift @xmath5-@xmath4 relationships .",
    "the main difference between the rcs and cnoc fits , however , is their normalization , which is significantly lower in the case of the rcs fit , translating into @xmath107 erg s@xmath22 at 5 kev , compared to @xmath108 erg s@xmath22 for cnoc .",
    "fits to the combined sample have significantly higher scatter and a much larger slope ( @xmath109 ) , inconsistent with self - similar evolution .",
    "this is an interesting result - taken with the individual fits it suggests that redshift evolution in the normalization of @xmath5-@xmath4 could be perceived as evolution in its slope , if the fitted sample covered a broad enough range of redshifts .",
    "this speculation naturally leads us to the important question of whether this trend towards lower luminosity is due to the different selection of the rcs clusters , or to a general evolutionary trend with redshift . in table",
    "[ table10 ] we list our fit parameters along with others taken from the literature . since a number of these studies use measurements at r@xmath90 , we compare our fits using estimates extrapolated to this radius .",
    "the results of  @xcite , from a selected sample of @xmath110 1 clusters , are consistent in slope with our individual sample fits , but even higher in normalization than the cnoc fit .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising given that the clusters in their sample are relaxed lensing clusters , many of which have strong cooling cores which can significantly increase the central cluster luminosity .",
    "in general , we do not here have enough information to excise cooling cores from the rcs data ; however , , in the cnoc data , we did attempt to remove these features from the cluster temperatures and luminosities @xcite .",
    "discrepancies between cnoc and rcs are thus not likely to be due to a higher incidence of cooling cores in the lower redshift sample .",
    "we also compare our sample to the @xmath111 x - ray selected sample in @xcite , which consists of 28 clusters taken from the chandra archive . at @xmath102",
    ", they find that the slope of the @xmath5-@xmath4 relationship is much steeper than that predicted by self - similar scaling  ( slope=3.72 @xmath112 0.47 ; figure  [ fig3 ] ) , suggesting a negative redshift evolution in the relationship ( i.e. , clusters at high-@xmath7 have lower @xmath5 for a given @xmath4 ) . a similar result is suggested by @xcite , based on simulations guided in part by low - redshift observations .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the extrapolation of our data to r@xmath90 .",
    "seven of our nine objects lie on the  @xcite relationship , suggesting at least some agreement between the properties of their x - ray and our optically - selected samples .",
    "we note that in general their higher redshift clusters also trend towards lower luminosities .",
    "while the slope of our fit to the rcs sample at @xmath102 is inconsistent with theirs , the slope of our combined @xmath98 sample is in agreement with their slope , another indication that we may be resolving evolution in slope into changes in the normalization of the relationship with redshift .",
    "our scatter for the individual fits is significantly lower than theirs ( @xmath113 vs. @xmath114 ) , whereas our scatter for the combined fits becomes more comparable ( 0.28 ) .",
    "thus , the rcs high - redshift sample appears to be at least qualitatively similar to this high - redshift x - ray selected sample , in support of a trend for samples of clusters at high redshift to have have lower luminosities at a given temperature .      upon examining the",
    "cosmologically corrected @xmath86m@xmath82 relationship , we again see disparity between the normalizations of the cnoc and rcs fits .",
    "this finding provides additional evidence that there is less gas for a given total mass in our high redshift sample .",
    "individual slopes at r@xmath63 agree with the self - similar value of 1.33 , while the slope of the combined sample fit is higher and inconsistent with that value ( table  [ table9 ] ; figure  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "our rcs fit at r@xmath90 is again consistent in normalization but not slope with  @xcite .",
    "likewise , again our combined ( r@xmath63 ) sample slope ( @xmath115 ) agrees well with theirs ( @xmath116 ) . our scatter ( @xmath117 ) is lower in all cases .",
    "the m@xmath87 relationship is by far the lowest - scatter ( @xmath118 ) relationship in this work ( figure  [ fig5 ] ) , though this is largely because of the degeneracy between the two parameters , with much of the scatter arising from differences in the spatial distribution of gas .",
    "all of our fits at r@xmath63 have consistent normalizations , and all but the cnoc fit have slopes which agree well with self - similar predictions . though the cnoc slope is higher ( @xmath119 ) , it is in good agreement with both of our listed r@xmath63 comparison fits  @xcite , as are the fits of both the rcs sample and the combined sample ( table  [ table10 ] ) .",
    "at r@xmath90 the rcs fit is in agreement with  @xcite ,  @xcite , and  @xcite .",
    "our normalization is somewhat higher , however , than all of theirs , and is in disagreement with that of  @xcite ( figure  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the three objects that are most responsible for driving up the normalization all have gas distributions which appear to be more concentrated than average ( @xmath120 ; table  [ table3 ] ) , which would tend to drive up the total mass at higher radius , noting again that at r@xmath90 our masses are extrapolations .",
    "in addition , the two most outlying points consist of our least massive cluster ( rcs1326 + 2903 , also our weakest detection in the detailed analysis sample ) , and our most massive cluster ( rcs2318 + 0034 ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning again that in figure  [ fig1 ] , the brightest part of rcs2318 + 0034 does not seem to lie at the center of the cluster s extended emission , indicating that this object may have recently undergone a merger , or could at least possess an appreciable amount of substructure .      in section  [ s :",
    "mass ] , we estimate the core ( @xmath121 ) gas mass fractions of our high-@xmath7 sample , finding values which are significantly lower than both the gas fractions of lower redshift x - ray selected clusters , and the expected universal gas fraction  ( @xmath122 ; * ? ? ?",
    "taking a weighted average over our objects results in a gas mass fraction of @xmath123 , in comparison with the cnoc weighted mean of @xmath124 and values of @xmath125 found within r@xmath63 in clusters with @xmath126 kev  @xcite .",
    "poor clusters and groups are often found to have lower gas mass fractions  @xcite , therefore we may expect this result for the lower temperature objects in our sample .",
    "this , however , does not explain our findings for the higher temperature objects .",
    "to investigate further , we first performed a k - s test on the @xmath127 values of subsets of both samples , choosing the 8 objects in the rcs sample and the 9 objects in the cnoc sample with temperatures between 3.5 and 8 kev .",
    "this test resulted in d=0.875 and p=0.002 , indicating that the gas mass fractions of the two samples are different at a confidence level of greater than 99% .",
    "a histogram showing the @xmath127 distributions of these subsamples is shown in figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "we examined the robustnesss of this result by repeating the k - s test after attempting to remove the effects of any possible trend in gas fraction with temperature .",
    "to do so we assumed that the rcs and cnoc samples can be combined and that the resulting apparent trend of @xmath128 with temperature is physical  ( note that the resulting relation is much steeper than the one suggested by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; figure  [ fig6 ] ) . under these extreme assumptions , the ks - test yields d=0.764 and p=0.007 , thus demonstrating the robustness of our earlier results .",
    "low gas mass fractions have previously been observed in clusters at high redshift by both the xmm - newton @xmath129 project  @xcite and  @xcite , and have been predicted in simulations of high redshift objects  @xcite .",
    "in addition , an sz / wmap study performed by  @xcite reports that  @xmath130 of expected baryonic mass is missing from the hot icm in their 193 clusters .",
    "redshift evolution , however , may not be the only possibility .",
    "multiple studies have confirmed that at least some fraction of their optically selected clusters have lower than expected @xmath5  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , therefore sample selection may also contribute to this effect .",
    "we explore selection biases in more depth in section  [ s : selection ] .",
    "given the possibilities present in the literature and a current lack of sufficient data to perform direct comparisons with significant samples matched in both mass and redshift , it is difficult to determine conclusively that the low gas fractions measured here are the result of cluster evolution .",
    "possible physical explanations for lower gas fractions are that our clusters have a comparatively higher amount of baryonic matter in the form of stars  @xcite , that gas is still infalling ( i.e. , in the process of virialization ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or that some mechanism has injected excess energy into the gas ( i.e. , galaxy formation , mergers , agn , radio jets ;  @xcite ) , thereby raising its entropy at high-@xmath7 . many of these processes occur with relatively higher frequency at high - redshift  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thus a general trend toward lower gas fractions might easily be expected in high-@xmath7 clusters      cluster entropy can be used as a tool for investigating the energy budget of baryons in clusters  @xcite .",
    "because it may provide insight into f@xmath131 discrepancies , we investigate it here for our two samples .",
    "the measurable quantity @xmath132 can be related to thermodynamic entropy by @xmath133 .",
    "the canonical radius for measuring this quantity is 0.1r@xmath134",
    "@xcite , so that is the radius at which we present it here .",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] shows a plot of cosmologically corrected entropy ( @xmath135 ) vs. temperature , with the relationship of  @xcite overlayed ( @xmath136 kev @xmath137 ) .",
    "the specific entropy of the rcs clusters seems overall to be slightly higher for a given temperature than that of the cnoc sample . a k - s test on the clusters with @xmath138 results in d=0.431 and p=0.208 , indicating a difference between the samples at an @xmath139 confidence level .",
    "as in the case of the gas mass fractions , we perform an additional k - s test after attempting to remove the trend in cluster entropy with temperature . using the relationship of  @xcite ( above ) , the ks - test yields d=0.764 and p=0.007 , indicating a systematic difference in the entropies of the two samples at a @xmath140 level .",
    "weighted means of the corrected ( 5 kev ) entropies of the two k - s sample subsets result in @xmath141 kev @xmath137 and @xmath142 kev @xmath137 , with the rcs clusters having higher entropy on average by a factor of 1.43 . because @xmath127 is proportional to gas density , at a constant temperature @xmath143 , therefore differences in entropy between the two samples can account for roughly 85% of their @xmath127 discrepancy , indicating that additional factors may be in effect as well .",
    "it remains difficult to determine the relative contributions of evolution and selection to possible differences in entropy .",
    "expectations of higher merger and agn activity at high-@xmath7  @xcite suggest that an evolutionary explanation is feasible ; however , x - ray surveys that select high central density objects may be prone to preferentially pick out low - entropy systems .",
    "the product of cluster temperature and gas mass , @xmath144 has been shown to be a reliable , low - scatter proxy for total cluster mass and to be well correlated to x - ray luminosity  @xcite . here",
    "we investigate relationships between these quantities and @xmath88 for our high redshift optically selected sample .",
    "we adopt self - similar @xmath145 scaling from  @xcite and  @xcite for the @xmath5 and mass relationships , respectively ; and use their best fitting slopes for our constrained slope fits .",
    "our individual samples can be seen to lie again on two separate relationships in the @xmath88-@xmath5 plane , of similar slope and differing normalization ( figure  [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "this can once more be explained as stemming from systematically lower gas mass fractions in the rcs sample .",
    "we can not make normalization comparisons to  @xcite at r@xmath63 ; however , none of the slopes of our @xmath5-@xmath88 fits are consistent with the slope resulting from fits to his overall sample , and when we fix the slope to his value our scatter increases by a factor of @xmath8 . at r@xmath90",
    "our fit to the rcs data agrees neither in slope nor in normalization with his fit ( figure  [ fig8 ] ) , but again it should be mentioned that our r@xmath90 values have been extrapolated from data within r@xmath63 .",
    "there is an even more significant discrepancy between the normalizations of the cnoc and rcs samples in the @xmath146m@xmath82 relationship .",
    "this is easily explained as we are already aware that gas mass fractions are lower in the rcs sample , and total mass vs. @xmath88 ( @xmath147  m@xmath131 ) highlights this difference .",
    "we find overall closer agreement with the slope of the @xmath146m@xmath82 relationship modeled by  @xcite than we did in the case of @xmath5-@xmath88 . here",
    "we see marginal agreement at r@xmath63 between their r@xmath90 slope and that of the rcs fit , and consistency with the slope of the cnoc sample relationship . at r@xmath90 , though the slope of the rcs fit is still consistent with theirs , the normalizations diagree .",
    "the reason for this is illustrated nicely in the right panel of figure  [ fig9 ] .",
    "the four clusters in our sample which do not lie on their relationship are those with the lowest gas mass fractions . and",
    "again we see that the three biggest outliers are those with the highest @xmath2 values , and that of these the two most discrepant are rcs1326 + 2903 and rcs2318 + 0034 .",
    "optical richness is effectively a measurement of galaxy overdensity within a given aperture , normalized for the evolving galaxy luminosity function and the expected spatial distribution of galaxies in the cluster .",
    "our chosen richness measurement , b@xmath148  @xcite , represents the galaxy - cluster spatial covariance amplitude  @xcite ,    @xmath149    in practice , b@xmath148 is based on the excess number counts of galaxies within 357 kpc of the cluster optical center , with a normalization applied to correct for the expected spatial distribution ( here we assume @xmath150=1.8 , which is in general agreement with actual galaxy distributions at these radii ) and for the evolving luminosity function of cluster galaxies .",
    "though some uncertainties exist in the evolution of cluster galaxies at redshifts of @xmath151 , they can be minimized by employing a red - sequence optical richness , b@xmath9 , which is calculated using only the more uniformly evolving red galaxies in a cluster , and which may be better correlated with the underlying cluster mass .",
    "this is the optical richness parameter which will be used throughout this work .",
    "values of b@xmath9  for this sample are given in table  [ table5 ] .",
    "it has been shown that b@xmath152 correlates well with the x - ray parameters of relaxed clusters  @xcite , and in  @xcite we have derived relationships for correlations of x - ray properties with b@xmath9 .",
    "these relationships , however , were calibrated for x - ray selected clusters at moderate redshift , and therefore may not accurately describe our current sample . here",
    "we test these correlations for optically selected clusters at high redshift . in the following",
    "we will assume that b@xmath9  behaves similar to the x - ray temperature when comparing to the x - ray properties .",
    "the rationale for this choice is that for a cluster with a fixed density profile , both the temperature and b@xmath9  do not change with redshift , whereas for instance m@xmath63 , @xmath5 , etc .",
    "do change ( following self - similar evolution ) .",
    "our actual data do not extend much beyond @xmath59 , so most of our fitting is performed within that radius .",
    "cluster properties included in our fits are @xmath5 , @xmath4 , and total mass .",
    "again we employ the bces algorithm of  @xcite . for each of our fits",
    "we adopt the form    @xmath153    where y represents the particular property being fit . for @xmath5 , @xmath4 , and total mass ,",
    "units of @xmath154 , 5 kev , and @xmath155 were used , respectively .",
    "rcs0439 - 2904 was again removed from fitting procedures , as it has been confirmed to be two closely - spaced systems in projection along the line of sight  @xcite .",
    "best fitting parameters and scatters are given in table  [ table11 ] , along with comparison fits from the literature .",
    "figure  [ fig10 ] shows the relationship between temperature and richness . here , there is little evidence for a systematic difference between the samples , with both the cnoc and the combined sample showing statistical agreement with the expected slope of @xmath156=1.11  @xcite .",
    "the rcs sample is on average slightly cooler at a given b@xmath9 , a tendency that might stem from sample selection ( see section  [ s : selection ] , below ) .",
    "note that both x - ray and optically - selected samples contain a few outliers , scattering towards higher temperature or lower richness .",
    "figure  [ fig11 ] shows relationships between richness , m@xmath63 and m@xmath134 . at r@xmath63",
    "only the cnoc sample shows agreement with the expected slope of 3/@xmath150 .",
    "all r@xmath134 fits are consistent with the values obtained for the cnoc sample by  @xcite using galaxy dynamics , and the fit reported in  @xcite for a sample of 33 rcs clusters ( @xmath157 ) .",
    "the consistency between these fits indicates a general agreement between both the samples and the different mass estimators ; however , it should also be noted that error bars on the fit parameters are quite large for this relationship .",
    "the @xmath5-b@xmath9  plot ( figure  [ fig12 ] ) in contrast , shows quite a bit of scatter for both samples , and a significant offset between the rcs and cnoc samples .",
    "this offset is expected for the rcs sample , based on the results of section  [ s : lxtx ] , but here we also include the additional clusters with low x - ray luminosity for which t@xmath81 could not be derived .",
    "rcs0439 - 2904 , the object which is spectroscopically confirmed to be a projection of two less massive systems , is the cross second from the right .",
    "the significantly higher amount of scatter that we see in this relationship when compared to any of the other @xmath5 relationships suggests that b@xmath9  is a less reliable predictor of x - ray luminosity than @xmath4 , total mass , or @xmath88 .",
    "of all the richness relationships we investigate , b@xmath9  is best correlated to x - ray temperature , with an average scatter ( all fits ) of only @xmath158 for the objects with measured @xmath4 ( minus rcs0439 - 2904 , which is not included in fitting ) .",
    "interestingly , this is less than the average scatter of our @xmath5-@xmath4 relationship for the same objects ( all fits ; @xmath159 ) , probably again due to the issue of missing icm baryons in the high-@xmath7 rcs sample .",
    "since @xmath4 is closely related to total mass , whereas @xmath5 is intimately tied to the gas density , differing gas mass fractions will shift the normalization in @xmath5-@xmath4 significantly , whereas b@xmath9   may be fairly independent of the amount of x - ray emitting gas .",
    "when fitting mass to richness , overall scatters average ( all fits ) to @xmath160 for m@xmath63 , and @xmath161 for m@xmath134 .",
    "the scatter in the rcs sample at r@xmath134 is particularly large , due in part to the two objects with high @xmath2 values ( rcs1326 + 2903 and rcs2318 + 0034 ) , and rcs2320 + 0033 which has a lower than expected b@xmath9 . in its role as a mass estimator ,",
    "b@xmath9  produces on average @xmath162 more scatter in @xmath163 than the t@xmath81-based mass proxies investigated here , and may suffer from a fraction of objects whose richnesses are affected by projection",
    ". however , the comparative speed and ease with which it can be obtained still recommend it as a potentially useful tool for mass estimations of large high redshift cluster samples .",
    "the rcs sample is effectively selected by richness ( b@xmath9 ) , whereas the cnoc sample was compiled from objects with high x - ray luminosity  @xcite .",
    "discrepancies in the relations between x - ray and optical properties for these two samples may thus partially be caused by sample selection , especially if the underlying distribution of x - ray - to - optical properties is intrinsically broad  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "both x - ray and optical surveys would then be expected to deliver biased samples of clusters , with the degree of bias based on the level of scatter in the selection criterion . here",
    "we discuss three sources of selection bias in optical and x - ray cluster samples : optical projection effects , eddington bias due to observational uncertainty , and sample bias for both optical and x - ray samples .",
    "one important difference in the cluster samples stems from the rcs cluster - finding process . while all but one of our objects were confirmed ( to s / n@xmath1 )",
    "as extended x - ray sources , the rcs sample is expected to also include a small fraction of objects whose richness is boosted by the superposition of other structures having galaxy colors similar to the cluster s red sequence .",
    "while these projections are much less problematic than in monochromatic cluster searches , they may still add systems into the rcs catalog with true richnesses significantly lower than the measured b@xmath9 .",
    "@xcite performed a series of simulations which suggest that the fraction of rcs clusters composed of significant projections is on the order of 5 - 10% .",
    "this estimate has been confirmed at @xmath164 via extensive spectroscopy of 33 rcs clusters  @xcite ; and at @xmath165 from a sample of 12 clusters  @xcite .",
    "additional spectroscopy as well as weak lensing estimates of additional clusters is underway .",
    "recently ,  @xcite examined the effects of local structures on the red sequence using the millennium cosmological simulations .",
    "they found that in the simulation , the frequency of significant projection increases at higher redshift , to @xmath166 20% at @xmath167 .",
    "however , their cluster - finding algorithm and richness estimate were significantly different from the rcs algorithm in many aspects ( galaxy magnitudes and colors , radial extent and background corrections ) , so this may not be directly comparable to the samples discussed here .",
    "our _ chandra _ observations suggest that perhaps 3 of 13 observed clusters may have x - ray luminosities which are significantly lower than expected from the rcs @xmath5-b@xmath9  relationship .",
    "all three of the outliers in figure  [ fig12 ] have been observed in detail spectroscopically , and two of these were found to have at least some degree of overlap with additional structures in the line of sight .",
    "rcs0439 - 2904 was found spectroscopically to consist of two objects in such close proximity that they may be interacting  @xcite .",
    "rcs1417 + 5305 is a similar case , though here the overlapping systems are different enough in redshift that they might be unrelated  @xcite .",
    "rcs2112 - 6326 exhibits a single spectroscopic peak at @xmath168  @xcite .",
    "it is not clear whether the highest richness systems in this sample might be subject to a higher contamination rate than the rcs-1 survey as a whole .",
    "because there is significant observational uncertainty in our richness estimates , and the number of clusters declines rapidly with increasing richness , it is also necessary to evaluate effects of a possible eddington bias in the x - ray / optical relationships . we calculate this possible bias by using the observed distribution of b@xmath9  in the rcs-1 sample , which falls as b@xmath9@xmath169 , where n  @xmath170 .",
    "uncertainties in b@xmath9  are calculated based on the statistics of galaxy counts in the clusters and in the statistical foreground / background galaxy distribution  @xcite , and tend to increase modestly with increasing richness .",
    "we model the typical gaussian 1-@xmath67 uncertainty in b@xmath9  as a function of b@xmath9  from an empirical fit to the observed distribution in rcs-1 :    @xmath171    this relationship predicts that the uncertainty will be @xmath172 at b@xmath9=300 @xmath173 mpc@xmath174 , at the lower end of our cluster richness distribution , and @xmath175 at 1000 @xmath173 mpc@xmath174 for very rich clusters . ( note that these errorbars are not identical to the detection significance for the cluster , but instead reflect the uncertainty in the measurement of the cluster s richness ) .",
    "convolving these relations predicts that the true distribution in richness for a measured b@xmath9  is skewed to lower values , with a mean value that is @xmath176 of the measured value .",
    "we then use our observed relationship between x - ray temperature derived from the cnoc clusters and b@xmath177 to calculate that the mean observed temperature for rcs clusters should be about 10% lower than the expected relationship at b@xmath9=1000 @xmath173 mpc@xmath174 and about 20% lower at b@xmath9=500 . these decrements will also tend to steepen the logarithmic slope of the @xmath4-b@xmath177 relationship by about 0.15 . varying",
    "the distribution parameters within reasonable limits produces corrections on the order of 10 - 30% in normalization at a given b@xmath9 , and a systematic increase of 0.1 - 0.3 in the slope .",
    "comparison with the @xmath4-b@xmath9  relation shown in figure  [ fig10 ] suggests that a correction for this eddington bias would ameliorate the discrepancies between the rcs and cnoc samples , likely resulting in statistical agreement between their respective fits .",
    "a similar calculation for x - ray luminosities was performed , with decrements in the x - ray luminosity of about 40% and 25% beneath predicted values at b@xmath9  500 and 1000 @xmath173 mpc@xmath174 , steepening the logarithmic slope of the @xmath5-b@xmath9  relationship by about 0.3 .",
    "this correction is not , however , sufficient to create agreement between the rcs and cnoc samples once bias in richness measurements has been accounted for , as is also indicated by their differing l@xmath81-t@xmath81 relations .",
    "note these calculations assume that observational uncertainty is the primary source of scatter in the correlations .",
    "a final consideration in comparing x - ray and optically - selected samples is the possibility that both selection methods produce biases when selecting clusters from a population with a significant intrinsic variation in x - ray or optical properties .",
    "if there is a significant intrinsic scatter in the properties of gas in cluster cores , systematic differences in x - ray characteristics between optically and x - ray selected samples may naturally arise .",
    "the roxs survey , a joint x - ray / optical survey for clusters  @xcite found that some of their optically selected clusters had lower than expected @xmath5 , suggesting that selection effects could be culpable .",
    "@xcite also performed an independent x - ray / optical survey for clusters , using the red - sequence as well as the monochromatic matched - filter technique .",
    "they found that the red - sequence methodology significantly out - performs monochromatic techniques in discovering and characterizing clusters .",
    "even so , they also found a significant difference in the x - ray luminosities of x - ray versus optically - selected clusters , with several examples of spectroscopically - confirmed low @xmath5 clusters .",
    "more recently  @xcite report that malmquist bias may be responsible for a higher ( by a factor of @xmath8 ) average @xmath5 in x - ray flux - limited samples . these studies all suggest that for a given cluster mass or temperature there is a significant intrinsic scatter in x - ray luminosity or optical richness , or possibly both",
    ".    if this is the case , then both x - ray and optically - selected clusters may be prone to bias .",
    "we first consider the effects of such bias on our observed @xmath5-@xmath4 relations , where we found the rcs clusters to be systematically lower in luminosity for a given temperature , and in addition calculate lower core gas fractions .",
    "this discrepancy could be interpreted as evidence for evolution in the properties of the icm , and the loose agreement of the rcs data with the high redshift x - ray selected sample of  @xcite supports this conclusion .",
    "in addition , our x - ray luminous cnoc comparison sample may include a significant bias .",
    "these clusters were chosen from the wide - area emss survey  @xcite primarily based on their x - ray luminosities and may indeed represent a sample of particularly luminous clusters .",
    "we summarize by noting that these selection biases in both x - ray and optical samples can be significant , but can be evaluated quantitatively , given additional independent information about the underlying cluster mass .",
    "in general , variations in the x - ray properties of clusters can be inferred most robustly from optically - selected clusters , and vice - versa , to minimize these effects .",
    "we have performed an in - depth x - ray investigation of 13 high redshift ( @xmath19 ) optically selected clusters of galaxies from the red - sequence cluster survey ( rcs ; table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "all but one of these clusters was detected by _",
    "chandra _ at a signal - to - noise ratio of greater than 3 ( table  [ table2 ] ) , though two additional clusters in our sample ( rcs1417 + 5305 and rcs2112 - 6326 ) , did not posess enough signal to support further analysis .",
    "initial imaging of the objects reveals that the rcs sample spans a wide range in cluster morphology ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) , from very regular objects ( e.g. , rcs1419 + 5326 ) to more disturbed systems ( e.g. , rcs2112 - 6326 ) .",
    "surface brightness profiles were extracted for ten clusters in @xmath178 annular bins , and were reasonably well fit by single @xmath2 models ( figure  [ fig2 ] and table  [ table3 ] ) .",
    "cluster emission was modeled with xspec , beginning with a spectral extraction region of 300 kpc radius .",
    "the results of single temperature spectral fits , combined with best fit @xmath2 models , were used to determine @xmath3 .",
    "spectra were re - extracted from regions of that radius for further temperature fitting and @xmath3 luminosity estimates , until extraction regions and r@xmath63 estimates were in agreement .",
    "results of this process are given in table  [ table4 ] .",
    "we have also used the @xmath179 relationship to compare the x - ray temperatures of three of our objects to currently available velocity dispersions  @xcite .",
    "we find consistency in all cases ( table  [ table6 ] ) , suggesting that these three objects are at least relatively undisturbed .    using the results of both spectral fitting and surface brightness modeling , x - ray masses were calculated for ten clusters in our sample out to @xmath3 ( table  [ table7 ] ) , with extrapolation to @xmath6 ( table  [ table8 ] ) .",
    "canonical x - ray scaling laws were investigated for nine clusters and compared to those of the moderate redshift ( @xmath180 ) cnoc sample ( tables  [ table9 ] and  [ table10 ] ) . for the @xmath103 relationship ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) ,",
    "both rcs and cnoc fits have slopes consistent with self - similar predictions ; however , their normalizations disagree .",
    "interestingly , the slope of our combined rcs - cnoc sample agrees with that of x - ray selected clusters at similar redshift  @xcite , suggesting that evolution in the normalization of the @xmath103 relationship may lie behind the observed steeper slopes .",
    "results from @xmath86m@xmath82 fits are qualitatively very similar to those of the @xmath5-@xmath4 relationship ( figure  [ fig4 ] ) , rcs and cnoc slopes are consistent with self - similarity at r@xmath63 , but disagree in normalization due to differing icm densities .",
    "the most notable outcome of our mass estimations is that the @xmath98 gas mass fractions of rcs clusters are lower than expected by a factor of @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "low gas mass fractions are also reported in the findings of other high redshift cluster studies , both observation and theory  @xcite .",
    "physical explanations for low gas fractions include suggestions that much of the baryonic mass has been converted into stars , that the gaeous component of these clusters is still infalling , or that some mechanism ( i.e. , galaxy formation , agn , mergers , radio jets ) is responsible for raising the entropy of the gas .",
    "though we do see some evidence for higher entropy in the rcs sample ( figure  [ fig7 ] ) , it may not be enough to explain the entire f@xmath131 discrepancy .",
    "further study will have to be undertaken to determine whether the overall lower gas fractions that permeate this sample are ubiquitous at high redshift , or an outcome of sample selection .",
    "explanations aside , the growing evidence that massive ( @xmath181 kev ) clusters may have an evolving or broad range of central gas mass fractions may have important consequences for the interpretation of future cluster surveys in the microwave and x - ray bands , which select in part on the basis of central gas density .",
    "scatter in this parameter will tend to reduce completeness and , if not properly accounted for , inject bias in the cluster samples such surveys produce .",
    "in addition , since sz mass determinations tend to rely on the assumption of a constant gas mass fraction  @xcite , complimentary data may be required to avoid systematic errors in sz total mass estimates .",
    "using red - sequence optical richness measurements of both samples the relationships between b@xmath9  and global cluster properties ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath182 , and m@xmath134 ) were investigated ( table  [ table11 ] ) .",

    "this can be explained by the lack of hot baryons in rcs clusters , which would affect cluster @xmath5 , but not temperature or b@xmath9 .",
    "richness - mass relationships are generally consistent with one another and with previous studies  @xcite , and we find an average scatter of @xmath186 for these relationships ( figure  [ fig11 ] ) .",
