    "the absence of ( or the reduction of the characteristic temperature for ) such a static sdw phase in na - ccoc may be attributed to that of the structural phase transition which is known to occur in la214 system@xcite . in lbco at @xmath16=1/8 ,",

    "since na - ccoc remains in the htt phase over the entire temperature range of observation ( @xmath50 k ) , the absence of the static sdw phase near @xmath51 may suggest a common trend that the ltt phase stabilizes the sdw phase ( by  pinning the dynamical stripe \" ) .",

    "these observations might in turn point to the reversed role of cause and effect between the instability towards the sdw phase and the occurrence of ltt phase .",
    "the present result would make a strong case for the sdw instability as an intrinsic feature of the cuo@xmath52 planes irrespective of the ltt phase .",
    "it might be speculated that the electronic state of the cu ions are sensitive to the _ local _ lattice distortion ( but not to the long range lattice morphology ) so that the local impurities like zn have relatively strong influence on the sdw instability . in this",

    "such an anomaly is also observed in many families of cuprates near the hole doping concentration of 1/8 , and it suggests that the sdw instability against local distortion of the cuo@xmath52 planes is a common feature of high-@xmath0 cuprate superconductors .",
