    "increasing numbers of today s systems deal with personal information ( e.g. , information about citizens , customers , etc . ) , where such information is protected by privacy laws @xcite .",
    "therefore , privacy has become a main concern for system designers . in other words , dealing with privacy related concerns is a must these days because privacy breaches may result in huge costs as well as a long - term consequences @xcite .",
    "privacy breaches might be due lack of appropriate security policies , bad security practices , attacks , data thefts , etc .",
    "however , most of these breaches can be avoided if privacy requirements of the system - to - be were captured properly during system design ( e.g. , privacy by design ( pbd ) ) @xcite , where privacy requirements aim to capture the types and levels of protection necessary to meet the privacy needs of the users .    nevertheless , just few works focused on considering privacy during the system design @xcite .",
    "more specifically , most existing work on privacy requirements often deal with them either as non - functional requirements ( nfrs ) with no specific criteria on how such requirements can be met @xcite , or as a part of security @xcite , i.e. , focusing mainly on confidentiality and overlooking important privacy aspects such as anonymity , pseudonymity , unlinkability , unobservability , etc .    on the other hand",
    ", privacy is an elusive and vague concept @xcite .",
    "although several efforts have been made to clarify the privacy concept by linking it to more refined concepts such as secrecy , person - hood , control of personal information , etc . , there is no consensus on the definition of these concepts or which of them should be used to analyze privacy @xcite .",
    "this has resulted in a lot of confusion among designers and stakeholders , which has led in turn to wrong design decisions . in this context ,",
    "a well - defined privacy ontology that captures privacy related concepts along with their interrelations would constitute a great step forward in designing privacy - aware systems .",
    "ontologies have been proven to be a key success factor for eliciting high - quality requirements , and it can facilitate and improve the job of requirements engineers @xcite , since it can reduce the conceptual vagueness and terminological confusion by providing a shared understanding of the related concepts between designers and stakeholders @xcite .",
    "in addition , the ontology should capture privacy requirements in their social and organizational context . since most complex systems these days ( e.g. , healthcare systems , smart cities , etc . ) are socio - technical systems @xcite , which consist not only of technical components but also of humans along with their interrelations , where different kinds of vulnerabilities might manifest themselves @xcite .",
    "focusing on the technical aspects and leaving the social and organizational aspects outside the system s boundary leaves the system open to different kinds of vulnerabilities that might manifest themselves in the social interactions and/or the organizational structure of the system @xcite .",
    "the flash crash @xcite and the allied irish bank scandal @xcite are good examples , where problems were not caused by mere technical failures , but it were also due to several socio - technical related vulnerabilities of the system .",
    "this paper applies systematic review techniques to survey available literature to identify the most mature studies that propose privacy ontologies / concepts .",
    "in addition , we further analyze the selected privacy related concepts / relations to identify the main ones in order to propose a novel ontology that can be used to capture privacy requirements .",
    "this paper is therefore intended to be a starting point to address the problem of identifying a core privacy ontology .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows ; section ( 2 ) describes the review process and the protocol underlining this systematic review .",
    "we present and discuss the review results and findings in section ( 3 ) . in section ( 4 )",
    "we propose a novel ontology for privacy requirements engineering .",
    "we discuss threats to validity in section ( 5 ) .",
    "related work is presented in section ( 6 ) , and we conclude and discuss future work in section ( 7 ) .",
    "a systematic review can be defined as a systematic process for defining research questions , searching the literature for the best available resources to answer such questions , and collecting available data from the resources for answering the research questions . following @xcite ,",
    "the review process ( depicted in figure [ fig : plan ] ) consists of three main phases :    1 .   planning the review , in which we formulate the research questions and we define the review protocol .",
    "2 .   conducting the review , in which we conduct the search process after identifying the search terms and the literature sources , and then we perform the study selection activity .",
    "reporting the results of the review , in which we collect detailed information from the selected studies in order to answer the research questions , and then we use the obtained data to answer the research questions , which we discuss in the following section .",
    "this phase is very important for the success of the review , for it is here that we define the research objectives and the way in which the review will be carried out .",
    "this includes two main activities : ( 1 ) formulating the research questions that the systematic review will answer ; and ( 2 ) defining the review protocol that specifies the main procedures to be taken during the review .",
    "formulating the review questions is a very critical activity since these questions are used to derive the entire systematic review methodology @xcite .",
    "therefore , we formulate the following four research questions ( rq ) to identify the main privacy concepts that have been presented in the literature :    rq1 : :    what are the privacy concepts / relations that have been used to capture    privacy concerns ?",
    "rq2 : :    what are the main concepts / relations that have been used for capturing    privacy requirements ?",
    "rq3 : :    do existing privacy studies cover the main privacy concepts / relations ?",
    "rq4 : :    what are the limitations of existing privacy studies ?",
    "the review protocol specifies the methods to be followed while conducting the systematic review .",
    "based on @xcite , a review protocol should specify the following : the strategy that will be used to search for primary studies selection ; study selection criteria ; study quality assessment criteria ; data extraction and dissemination strategies .",
    "in the rest of this section , we discuss how we specify and perform each of these activities .",
    "this phase is composed of two main activities : 1- search strategy ; and 2- study selection , where each of them is composed of several sub - activities . in what follows ,",
    "we discuss them .",
    "the search strategy aims to find as many studies relating to the research questions as possible using an objective and repeatable search strategy @xcite .",
    "the search activity consists of three main sub - activities : 1- identify the search terms , 2- identify the literature resources , and 3- conduct the search process .    *",
    "identify the search terms . * following @xcite , we derived the main search terms from the research questions .",
    "in particular , we used the boolean and to link the major terms , and we use the boolean or to incorporate alternative synonyms of such terms .",

    "the search process ( shown in figure [ fig : process ] ) consists of two main stages :    search stage 1 . : :    we have used the search terms to search the six electronic database    sources , and only papers with relevant titles have been selected ; search stage 2 .",

    "moreover , when we were able to identify multiple version of the same    paper , only the most complete one was included . finally , we excluded    any paper that has been published before 1996 , since we were not able    to find any concrete work related to our research before 1996 .",

    "<S> most existing work on privacy requirements deals with them as a special case of security requirements . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , key aspects of privacy are , usually , overlooked . in this context , wrong design decisions might be made due to insufficient understanding of privacy concerns . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we address this problem with a systematic literature review whose main purpose is to identify the main concepts / relations for capturing privacy requirements . in addition , the identified concepts / relations are further analyzed to propose a novel privacy ontology to be used by software engineers when dealing with privacy requirements . </S>"
