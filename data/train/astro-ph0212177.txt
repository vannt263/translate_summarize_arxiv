    "the main asteroid belt , the trans - neptunian belt , and the oort cloud are considered to be the main sources of the objects that could collide with the earth .",
    "reviews of the asteroid and comet hazard were given by ipatov ( 2000 , 2001 ) , and bottke et al .",

    "( 2002 ) , binzel et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , and weissman et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , believe that asteroids are the main source of near - earth objects ( neos , i.e. objects with perihelion distance @xmath0@xmath11.3 au ) .",
    "bottke et al .",
    "( 2002 ) considered that there are 200@xmath2140 km - sized jupiter - family comets at @xmath0@xmath11.3 au , with @xmath380% of them being extinct comets .",
    "duncan et al . (",
    "1995 ) and kuchner ( 2002 ) investigated the migration of trans - neptunian objects ( tnos ) to neptune s orbit , and levison and duncan ( 1997 ) studied the migration from neptune s orbit to jupiter s orbit .",
    "ipatov and hahn ( 1999 ) considered the migration of jupiter - crossing objects ( jcos ) with initial orbits close to the orbit of comet p/1996 r2 and found that on average such objects spend about 5000 yr in orbits which cross both the orbits of jupiter and earth . using these results and additional orbit integrations , and assuming that there are",
    "@xmath4 1-km tnos with 30@xmath1@xmath5@xmath150 au ( jewitt and fernandez , 2001 ) , ipatov ( 2000 , 2001 ) found that about @xmath6 1-km former tnos are",
    "jupiter - crossers now and 10 - 20% or more 1-km earth - crossers could have come from the edgeworth - kuiper belt into jupiter - crossing orbits . in the present paper",
    "we use the estimates by ipatov ( 2001 ) , but now include a much larger number of jcos .",
    "preliminary results were presented by ipatov ( 2002 , 2003 ) , who also discussed the formation of tnos and asteroids .",
    "as the actual collisions of migrating objects with terrestrial planets are rare , we use an approximation of random phases and orientations to estimate probabilities of collision for families of objects with similar orbital elements .",
    "we suppose that their semi - major axes @xmath5 , eccentricities @xmath7 and inclinations @xmath8 are fixed , but the orientations of the orbits can vary . when the orbit of a minor body crosses the orbit of a planet at a distance @xmath9 from the sun , the characteristic time to collide , @xmath10 , is a factor of @xmath11 times that computed with an approximation of constant velocity , where @xmath12 is the velocity at the point where the orbit of the body crosses the orbit of the planet , and @xmath13 is the velocity for the same semi - major axis and a circular orbit .",
    "this coefficient @xmath14 modifies the formulas obtained by ipatov ( 1988a , 2000 ) for characteristic collision and close encounter times of two objects moving around the sun in crossing orbits .",
    "these formulas depend also on the synodic period and improve on pik s formulas when the semi - major axes of the objects are close to each other . as an example , at @xmath7=0.7 and @xmath5=3.06 au , we have @xmath14=2.26 .",
    "based on these formulas , we calculated probabilities ( 1/@xmath10 ) for @xmath31300 neos , including 343 venus - crossers , 756 earth - crossers and 1197 mars - crossers .",
    "the values of @xmath10 ( in myr ) , @xmath14 , and the number @xmath15 of objects considered are presented in table 1 .",
    "we considered separately the atens , apollos , amors , and several jupiter - family comets ( jfcs ) .",
    "the relatively small values of @xmath10 for atens and for all neos colliding with the earth are due to several atens with small inclinations discovered during the last three years .",
    "if we increase the inclination of the aten object 2000 sg344 from @xmath8=@xmath16 to @xmath8=@xmath17 , then for collisions with the earth we find @xmath10=28 myr and @xmath14=0.84 for atens and @xmath10=97 myr and @xmath14=1.09 for neos .",
    "these times are much longer , and illustrate the importance of rare objects . due to observational biases actual values of @xmath10 can be greater than those in table 1 .",
    "as the next step in estimating probabilities , we calculated the orbital evolution for thousands of test particles with initial orbits similar to known comets and asteroids , but having slightly different initial conditions .",
    "the results confirm that most of the collision probability comes from a handful of very rare cases in which the test particle is earth - crossing for an extended period of time . for initial investigations of the migration of bodies under the gravitational influence of the planets",
    ", we used the integration package of levison and duncan ( 1994 ) . in most cases we omitted the influence of mercury and pluto . here and in tables 2 - 3 and figs . 1 , 2 and 4 we present the results obtained by the bulirsh - stoer method ( bulsto code ) with the integration step error less than @xmath28@xmath29[@xmath30-@xmath31 , and in the next section we compare them with those of bulsto at @xmath28@xmath32@xmath33 and a symplectic method .",

    "even if the number of apollo objects is smaller than that based on @xmath43 runs , it may still be comparable to the real number ( 750 ) of 1-km earth - crossing objects ( half of them are in orbits with @xmath5@xmath12 au ) , although the latter number does not include those in highly eccentric orbits .",
    "the values of the characteristic time ( usually @xmath67 ) for the collision of a former jco or a resonant asteroid with a planet ( see tables 2 and 5 ) are greater than the values of @xmath10 for neos in table 1 , @xmath67@xmath951.1 gyr for 7852 objects , so we expect that the mean inclinations and eccentricities of unobserved neos are greater than those for the neos that are already known .",
    "jedicke et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found similar results . on average , the values of @xmath67 for our @xmath43 series and for most of our simulated jcos were not greater than those for our calculated asteroids , and migrating earth - crossing objects had similar @xmath7 and @xmath8 for both former jcos and resonant asteroids .",
    "former jcos , which move in earth - crossing orbits for more than 1 myr , while moving in such orbits , usually had larger @xmath53 and smaller @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( sometimes similar to those of the observed neos , see figs . 1 and 3 ) than other jcos .",
    "it is easier to observe orbits with smaller values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and probably , many of the neos moving in orbits with large values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 have not yet been discovered .",
    "about 1% of the observed apollos cross jupiter s orbit , and an additional 1% of apollos have aphelia between 4.7 - 4.8 au , but these jupiter - crossers are far from the earth most of time , so their actual fraction of ecos is greater than for observed ecos .",
    "the fraction of earth - crossers among observed jupiter - family comets is about 10% .",
    "this is a little more than @xmath188 for our @xmath43 runs , but less than for 7850 jcos . for our former resonant asteroids",
    ", @xmath60 is relatively large ( @xmath950.2 myr ) , and such asteroids can reach cometary orbits .",
    "comets are estimated to be active for @xmath189@xmath3@xmath190@xmath6 yr .",
    "@xmath189 is smaller for closer encounters with the sun ( weissman et al . , 2002 ) , so for comet 2p it is smaller than for other jfcs .",
    "some former comets can move for tens or even hundreds of myr in neo orbits , so the number of extinct comets can exceed the number of active comets by several orders of magnitude .",
    "the mean time spent by encke - type objects in earth - crossing orbits is @xmath520.4 myr ( even for @xmath167 ) .",
    "this time corresponds to @xmath5240 - 400 extinct comets of this type .",
    "note that the diameter of comet 2p is about 5 - 10 km , so the number of smaller extinct comets can be much larger .",
    "the above estimates of the number of neos are approximate .",
    "for example , it is possible that the number of 1-km tnos is several times smaller than @xmath4 , while some scientists estimated that this number can be up to @xmath191 ( jewitt , 1999 ) .",
    "also , the fraction of tnos that have migrated towards the earth might be smaller .",
    "on the other hand , the above number of tnos was estimated for @xmath5@xmath150 au , and tnos from more distant regions can also migrate inward .",
    "probably , the oort cloud could also supply jupiter - family comets . according to asher et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , the rate of a cometary object decoupling from the jupiter vicinity and transferring to an neo - like orbit is increased by a factor of 4 or 5 due to nongravitational effects ( see also fernandez and gallardo , 2002 ) .",
    "this would result in larger values of @xmath61 and @xmath57 than those shown in tables 2 and 5 .",
    "our estimates show that , in principle , the trans - neptunian belt can provide a significant portion of the earth - crossing objects , although many neos clearly came from the main asteroid belt",
    ". it may be possible to explore former tnos near the earth s orbit without sending spacecraft to the trans - neptunian region . according to our results",
    ", many former jupiter - family comets can have orbits typical of asteroids , and collide with the earth from typical neo orbits .",
    "based on the collision probability @xmath192 we find that 1-km former tnos now collide with the earth once in 3 myr .",
    "this value of @xmath53 is smaller than that for our @xmath43 runs , does not include the champions in collision probability , and is only 1/20 of that for our 7852 jcos . using @xmath192 and assuming the total mass of planetesimals that ever crossed jupiter s orbit is @xmath3@xmath193 , where @xmath194 is the mass of the earth ( ipatov , 1993 , 2000 ) , we conclude that the total mass of bodies that impacted the earth is @xmath195 .",
    "if ices comprised only half of this mass , then the total mass of ices @xmath196 that were delivered to the earth from the feeding zone of the giant planets is about the mass of the terrestrial oceans ( @xmath197 ) .",
    "the calculated probabilities of collisions of objects with planets show that the fraction of the mass of the planet delivered by short - period comets can be greater for mars and venus than for the earth ( compare the values of @xmath53@xmath198@xmath199 using @xmath53 from tables 2 and 5 , where @xmath199 is the mass of the planet ) .",
    "this larger mass fraction would result in relatively large ancient oceans on mars and venus . on the other hand , there is the deuterium / hydrogen paradox of earth s oceans , as the d / h ratio is different for oceans and comets .",
    "pavlov et al . ( 1999 ) suggested that solar wind - implanted hydrogen on interplanetary dust particles could provide the necessary low - d / h component of earth s water inventory .",
    "our estimate of the migration of water to the early earth is in accordance with chyba ( 1989 ) , but is greater than those of morbidelli et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and levison et al .",
    "the latter obtained smaller values of @xmath196 , and we suspect that this is because they did not take into account the migration of bodies into orbits with @xmath69@xmath14.2 au and @xmath0@xmath11 au .",
    "perhaps this was because they modeled a relatively small number of objects , and levison et al .",
    "( 2001 ) did not take into account the influence of the terrestrial planets . in",
    "our runs the probability of a collision of a single object with a terrestrial planet could be much greater than the total probability of thousands of other objects , so the statistics are dominated by rare occurrences that might not appear in smaller simulations .",
    "the mean probabilities of collisions can differ by orders of magnitude for different jcos .",
    "other scientists considered other initial objects and smaller numbers of jcos , and did not find decoupling from jupiter , which is a rare event .",
    "we believe there is no contradiction between our present results and the smaller migration of former jcos to the near - earth space that was obtained in earlier work , including our own papers ( e.g. ipatov and hahn , 1999 ) , where we used the same integration package .    from measured albedos , fernandez et al .",
    "( 2001 ) concluded that the fraction of extinct comets among neos and unusual asteroids is significant ( at least 9% are candidates ) .",
    "rickman et al . ( 2001 ) believed that comets played an important and perhaps even dominant role among all km - size earth impactors . in their opinion , dark spectral classes that might include the ex - comets are severely underrepresented ( see also jewitt and fernandez , 2001 ) .",
    "our runs showed that if one observes former comets in neo orbits , then it is probable that they have already moved in such orbits for millions ( or at least hundreds of thousands ) years , and only a few of them have been in such orbits for short times ( a few thousand years ) .",
    "some former comets that have moved in typical neo orbits for millions or even hundreds of millions of years , and might have had multiple close encounters with the sun , could have lost their mantles , which causes their low albedo , and so change their albedo ( for most observed neos , the albedo is greater than that for comets ; fernandez et al . , 2001 ) and would look like typical asteroids .",
    "typical comets have larger rotation periods than typical neos ( binzel et al . , 1992 ) , but , while losing considerable portions of their masses , extinct comets can decrease these periods . in future",
    "we plan to consider a larger initial number of objects initially located beyond jupiter in order to better estimate their probabilities of migration to a near - earth space .",
    "collision statistics for the terrestrial planets are dominated by very small numbers of bodies that reach orbits with high collision probabilities , so it is essential to consider very large numbers of particles .",
    "the initial conditions for the orbit integrations appear to matter more than the choice of orbit integrator .",
    "some jupiter - family comets can reach typical neo orbits and remain there for millions of years . while the probability of such events is small ( about 0.1% in our runs and perhaps smaller for other initial data ) , nevertheless the majority of collisions of former jcos with the terrestrial planets are due to such objects .",
    "the amount of water delivered to the earth during planet formation could be about the mass of the earth oceans . from the dynamical point of view",
    "there could be ( not must be ) many extinct comets among the neos . for better estimates of the portion of extinct comets among neos we will need orbit integrations for many more tnos and jcos , and wider analysis of observations and craters .",
