    "stars with significant rotation are known to exhibit excess scatter ( `` jitter '' ) in their radial velocities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , due to enhanced chromospheric activity and the associated surface inhomogeneities ( spottedness ) .",
    "this jitter is in addition to the internal errors in the measured velocities , and could potentially be significant in our case .",
    "we note that after pre - whitening the light curve  with the transit component , we found no significant sinusoidal signal above 0.3mmag amplitude . from this",
    "we conclude that there is no very significant spot activity on the star ( in the observed 500 day window ) . in order to estimate the level of chromospheric activity in the star",
    ", we have derived an activity index from the h and k lines in our keck spectra of @xmath130 .",
    "for this value the calibration by @xcite predicts velocity jitter ranging from 8 to 16@xmath131 . an earlier calibration by @xcite , parametrized in terms of the projected rotational velocity , predicts a jitter level of up to 50@xmath131  for our measured @xmath99 of @xmath132 .",
    "a different calibration by the same authors in terms of @xmath133  gives 20@xmath131 .",
    "an additional way to estimate the jitter is to compare  to stars of the lick planet search program @xcite that have similar properties ( @xmath134 , @xmath135 ) .",
    "there are four such stars ( j.  johnson , private communication ) , and their average jitter is @xmath136",
    ". a more direct measure for the particular case of  may be obtained from the multiple exposures we collected during a 3-night keck run in 2007 march . ignoring the small velocity variations due to orbital motion during",
    "any given night , the overall scatter of these 8 exposures relative to the nightly means is @xmath1120@xmath131 .",
    "this may be taken as an estimate of the jitter on short timescales , although it could be somewhat larger over the entire span of our observations .",
    "altogether , it is reasonable to expect the jitter to be at least 10@xmath131 , and possibly around 3050@xmath131  for this star .",
    "we have three velocity data sets available for analysis : 13 relative radial velocity measurements from keck , 10 from lick , and 53 measurements from the cfa ds , which are nominally on an absolute scale ( ) . given the potential effect of stellar jitter , we performed weighted keplerian orbital solutions for a range of jitter values from 10 to 80@xmath131  with 10@xmath131  steps .",
    "these jitter values were added in quadrature to all individual internal errors .",
    "we performed separate fits for the star orbited by a single planet , both with and without the cfa ds measurements , since these have errors ( @xmath11600@xmath131 ) significantly larger than keck ( 59@xmath131 ) or lick ( 4090@xmath131 ) . in all of these solutions we held the period and transit epoch fixed at the photometric values given earlier .",
    "the parameters adjusted are the velocity semi - amplitude @xmath137 , the eccentricity @xmath138 , the longitude of periastron @xmath139 , the center - of - mass velocity for the keck relative velocities @xmath140 , and offsets @xmath141 between keck and lick and @xmath142 between keck and cfa ds .",
    "the fitted parameters were found to be fairly insensitive to the level of jitter assumed .",
    "however , only for a jitter of @xmath1160@xmath131  ( or @xmath1170@xmath131when the cfa ds data are included ) did the @xmath143 approach values expected from the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "there are thus two possible conclusions : if we accept that  has stellar jitter at the 60@xmath131  level , then a single - planet solution such as ours adequately describes our observations .",
    "if , on the other hand , the true jitter is much smaller ( @xmath144 ) , then the extra scatter requires further explanation ( see below ) .",
    "our adopted orbital parameters for the simplest single - planet keplerian solution are based only on the more precise keck and lick data , and assume the jitter is 60@xmath131  ( ) .",
    "the orbital fit is shown graphically in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : rv ] . in this figure ,",
    "the zero - point of phase is chosen to occur at the epoch of mid - transit , @xmath145 ( hjd ) .",
    "the most significant results are the large eccentricity ( @xmath146 ) , and the large velocity semi - amplitude ( @xmath147 , indicating a very massive companion ) . as we show in the next section ( ) ,",
    "the companion is a planet , i.e.  , which we hereafter refer to as hat - p-2b .    as a consistency check",
    "we also fitted the orbits by fixing only the period , and leaving the transit epoch as a free parameter .",
    "we found that for all values of the stellar jitter the predicted time of transit as derived from the rv fit was consistent with the photometric ephemeris within the uncertainties .",
    "we also found that in these fits the orbital parameters were insensitive to the level of jitter and to whether or not the cfa ds data were included .",
    "the eccentricity values ranged from 0.51 to 0.53 .",
    "if we assume that the true stellar jitter is small , then the excess scatter in the rv fit could be explained by a third body in the system , i.e. , a hypothetical hat - p-2c .",
    "in addition , such a body could provide a natural dynamical explanation for the large eccentricity of hat - p-2b at this relatively short period orbit .",
    "preliminary two - planet orbital fits using all the data yielded solutions only significant at the 2-sigma level , not compelling enough to consider as evidence for such a configuration .",
    "additional rv measurements are needed to firmly establish or refute the existence of hat - p-2c .",
    "we also exploited the fact that the hatnet light curve  has a unique time coverage and precision , and searched for signs of a second transit that might be due to another orbiting body around the host star .",
    "successive box - prewhitening based on the bls spectrum and assuming trapezoidal - shape transits revealed no secondary transit deeper than the 0.1% level and period @xmath148 days .",
    "as an initial test to explore the possibility that the photometric signal we detect is a false positive ( blend ) due to contamination from an unresolved eclipsing binary , we modeled the light curve assuming there are three coeval stars in the system , as described by @xcite .",
    "we were indeed able to reproduce the observed light curve with a configuration in which the brighter object is accompanied by a slightly smaller f star which is in turn being eclipsed by a late - type m dwarf .",
    "however , the predicted relative brightness of the two brighter objects at optical wavelengths would be @xmath149 , and this would have been easily detected in our spectra .",
    "this configuration can thus be ruled out .",
    "the reality of the velocity variations was tested by carefully examining the spectral line bisectors of the star in our more numerous keck spectra .",
    "if the velocity changes measured are due only to distortions in the line profiles arising from contamination of the spectrum by the presence of a binary with a period of 5.63 days , we would expect the bisector spans ( which measure line asymmetry ) to vary with this period and with an amplitude similar to the velocities ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the bisector spans were computed from the cross - correlation function averaged over 15 spectral orders blueward of 5000  and unaffected by the iodine lines , which is representative of the average spectral line profile of the star .",
    "the cross correlations were performed against a synthetic spectrum matching the effective temperature , surface gravity , and rotational broadening of the star as determined from the sme analysis . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rv ] , while the measured velocities exhibit significant variation as a function of phase ( upper panel ) , the bisector spans are essentially constant within the errors ( lower panel )",
    ". therefore , this analysis rules out a blend scenario , and confirms that the orbiting body is indeed a planet .",
    "for a precise determination of the physical properties of hat - p-2b we have modeled the  sloan @xmath22-band photometric data shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : lc ] .",
    "the model is an eccentric keplerian orbit of a star and planet , thus accounting for the nonuniform speed of the planet and the reflex motion of the star . outside of transits ,",
    "the model flux is unity . during transits ,",
    "the model flux is computed using the formalism of @xcite , which provides an analytic approximation of the flux of a limb - darkened star that is being eclipsed .",
    "the free parameters were the mid - transit time @xmath150 , the radius ratio @xmath151 , the orbital inclination @xmath152 , and the scale parameter @xmath118 , where @xmath153 is the semimajor axis of the relative orbit .",
    "the latter parameter is determined by the time scales of the transit ( the total duration and the partial - transit duration ) , and is related to the mean density of the star ( see ) .",
    "the orbital period , eccentricity , and argument of pericenter were fixed at the values determined previously by fitting the radial velocity data .",
    "the limb darkening law was assumed to be quadratic , with coefficients taken from @xcite .    to solve for the parameters and their uncertainties",

    "it thus appears to be intermediate in its properties between jupiter - like planets and more massive objects like brown dwarfs or even low mass stars . according to theories , stars with mass @xmath208",
    "have a core , where internal pressure is dominated by classical gas ( ions and electrons ) , and the @xmath209 radius  mass relation holds in hydrostatic equilibrium ( for a review and details on the following relations see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "below @xmath210 mass , however , the equation of state in the core becomes dominated by degenerate electron gas ( @xmath211 for full degeneracy ) , yielding an expected minimum in the mass  radius relationship ( around 73@xmath9 ) . below this mass , the partial degeneracy of the object and the classical ( @xmath212 ) coulomb pressure together yield an almost constant radius ( @xmath213 ) .",
    "hat - p-2b is a demonstration of this well known phenomenon .",
    "( the approximate relation breaks below @xmath214 , where the degeneracy saturates , and a classical mass  radius behaviour is recovered ) .",
    "compared to the other 18 known transiting planets , hat - p-2b is also unique in having an orbit with remarkably high eccentricity .",
    "the primary question is how such an eccentricity was created in the first place .",
    "one possible explanation could be that the planet was scattered inward from a larger orbit , acquiring a high eccentricity in the process @xcite .",
    "if so , then the scattering event might have caused its new orbital plane to be inclined relative to the plane of the original disk , and hence out of the equatorial plane of the parent star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this angle between these two planes should be readily measurable from the rossiter - mclaughlin effect @xcite .",
    "indeed , the star  is an ideal subject for studying this effect , because its rapid rotation should lead to a relatively large rossiter - mclaughlin signal .",
    "there are a number of other interesting issues related to the high eccentricity of hat - p-2b . during its 5.63 day orbit ,",
    "the insolation reaching the planet s surface varies by a factor of 9 . assuming an albedo of 0.1 @xcite and complete redistribution of insolation energy over the surface of the planet",
    ", the equilibrium temperature varies from about 2150k at periastron to 1240k at apastron .",
    "this would have a major influence on atmospheric dynamics and photochemistry .",
    "it is interesting to compare the properties of the hat - p-2 system with the @xmath17  boo system , which  as already noted  harbors a close - in planet with minimum mass @xmath215 .",
    "similarities of the two parent stars include the nearly identical masses , effective temperature , and the rapid rotation , although @xmath17  boo , with @xmath216}= + 0.28 $ ] , is somewhat more metal rich than , with @xmath216}= + 0.12 $ ] .",
    "a striking difference is that , while the orbital eccentricity of hat - p-2b is 0.5 , the eccentricity of @xmath17  boo  b is not measurably different from zero .",
    "however , @xmath17  boo  b s orbital period , 3.3 days , is almost half that of hat - p-2b .",
    "a large fraction of close - in planets with @xmath217 days have significant eccentricities ( @xmath218 ) although not as large as hat - p-2b . for discussion on the eccentricity distribution",
    "see @xcite . as circularization timescales",
    "are thought to be very steep functions of the orbital semi - major axis @xcite , one could then argue that hat - p-2b s large value of @xmath138 is due to either the fact that the planet s orbit is not yet circularized ( while @xmath17  boo  b s instead is ) , or to the presence of a second planet in the hat - p-2 system , or to rather different formation / migration scenarios altogether .    , with visual magnitude 8.71 , is the fourth brightest among the known stars harboring transiting planets .",
    "therefore it has special interest because of the possibilities for followup with large space or ground - based telescopes .",
