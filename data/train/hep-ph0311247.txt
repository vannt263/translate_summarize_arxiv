    "understanding the physics of event shapes and jet rates ( collectively _ jet observables _ ) requires a deep knowledge of qcd dynamics .",
    "their distributions ( defined as the fraction of events @xmath0 with the observable s value @xmath1 less than @xmath2 ) explore a wide range of physical scales , from the more inclusive region @xmath3 , well described by fixed order perturbative ( pt ) calculations , to the extreme exclusive region @xmath4 where the language of quarks and gluons is no longer applicable . describing the intermediate region",
    "requires a resummation of logarithmic enhanced contributions that appear at all orders in the pt expansion @xcite .",
    "resummation can then be seen as the link between pt and np physics .",
    "given that interest , a number of event shapes have been introduced , and for most of them there exist both next - to - leading order ( nlo ) calculations as well as resummed predictions at next to - leading logarithmic ( nll ) accuracy .    unfortunately , while it is straightforward to compute a nlo distribution by just interfacing a fixed order monte carlo program with the observable definition in the form of a computer routine , for what concerns resummation a separate analytic calculation has to be performed for each observable .",
    "together with gavin salam and giulia zanderighi we started then a project whose goal is the construction of a computer code that takes as input from the user the definition of an observable and returns its resummed distribution at nll accuracy .",
    "the starting point of such a programme is the classification of ll and nll effects .",
    "consider a born system consisting of @xmath5 hard partons ( _ legs _ ) @xmath6 and an observable @xmath1 that vanish in the born limit , i.e. @xmath7 .    for most jet observables ll contributions can be addressed by computing @xmath0 when a single soft gluon collinear to the hard legs is emitted and exponentiating the result .",
    "for any of these _ exponentiating _ quantities , nl logarithms can have different origins :    * emission of gluons soft at large angles or hard and collinear .",
    "such contributions can be resummed by exponentiating the single emission result for @xmath0 ; * _ multiple emission _",
    "effects , which originate when , given a set of emitted partons @xmath8 , all @xmath9 but @xmath10 ( or viceversa ) , so that one has to take into account how all emissions contribute to build up the observable s value ; * _ non - global _ logarithms  @xcite , that arise whenever @xmath1 is sensitive to emissions only in a part of the phase space . unfortunately such nll contributions are known only in the large @xmath11 limit , thus reducing the accuracy of resummed predictions for non - global observables .",
    "given the above classification we restrict ourselves to exponentiating global observables .",
    "under the additional hypothesis that , after a soft emission collinear to leg @xmath12 , the observable s dependence on the emitted transverse momentum @xmath13 , rapidity @xmath14 and azimuthal angle @xmath15 ( all with respect to @xmath12 ) obeys the following parametrisation @xmath16 at nll accuracy @xmath0 is given by the master formula  @xcite @xmath17 here @xmath18 embodies all ll contributions and the nll contributions that can be taken into account by exponentiating the single emission result .",
    "this function , computed analytically , depends parametrically on @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 as well as on the azimuthal average @xmath22 .",
    "the nll function @xmath23 represents the multiple emission correction factor .",
    "its general expression is @xcite @xmath24 where the average is taken over all configuration of soft and collinear gluons such that , for fixed @xmath25 , the probability density of emissions along leg @xmath12 is constant ( the actual value of the constant depends on @xmath25 and on the colour factors of the hard legs , see @xcite ) .",
    "although the above procedure is rather complicated , we were able to embody it a computer code , caesar , that completely automates the resummation of any exponentiating global jet - observable  @xcite .",
    "let us show how the program works in the specific case of an event shape in hadronic dijet production . given a unit vector @xmath26 orthogonal to the beam axis",
    "we define the global transverse thrust : @xmath27 where @xmath28 are the final state transverse momenta with respect to the beam .",
    "the program chooses a reference born event with two incoming and two outgoing hard partons and generates soft and collinear emissions .",
    "it first checks that a resummation in the @xmath29-jet limit is feasible and that the observable is global .",
    "it then verifies that the parametrisation holds and determines for each leg @xmath30 .",
    "it recognises also whether @xmath31 , with @xmath32 integer , otherwise tabulates the azimuthal dependence .",
    "the program then should determine whether the observable exponentiates and compute the function @xmath33 via a monte carlo procedure @xcite . in this case",
    "it recognises that @xmath34 is additive , that is @xmath35 , which allows us to skip all the subsequent steps , since for additive observables exponentiation holds and @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "these results are automatically tabulated ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : result ] ) , and used as inputs for the master formula to compute the nll resummed @xmath34 distribution . in fig .",
    "[ fig : result ] we see the differential distribution @xmath37 at the tevatron run ii c.o.m . energy @xmath38 corresponding to selected dijets with @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "we use the cteq6 m pdf set  @xcite and set factorisation and renormalisation scales at the partonic c.o.m .",
    "the plot shows a clean separation among the various partonic channels , information that can be exploited for fits of the parton densities .    [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the main feature of our approach is that the output curves are pure nll functions , without contamination with spurious subleading contributions , so that they can be straightforwardly matched with fixed order results , and any hadronisation model can be applied . at present our effort",
    "is concentrated in releasing the first version of the program .",
    "the next step will be including in the code an automated matching with nlo calculations @xcite , which will open the way to a vast amount of phenomenological analyses ."
