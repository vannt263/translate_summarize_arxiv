    "these clusters are valuable relics of the earlier universe , when violent and intense star formation was common . indeed , globular clusters are ubiquitous around massive galaxies today @xcite , and they must have been formed prodigiously in the primordial universe given that @xmath12 may have been subsequently destroyed @xcite .    however , the conditions required for the creation of globular clusters have puzzled astronomers for decades . for many years",
    "the prevailing belief was that globular clusters were simply formed by the gravitational collapse of density inhomogeneities in the early universe @xcite , and little was known about their early evolution .",
    "however , in the mid 1990 s , observations using the _ hubble space telescope _ discovered extremely young , massive , and compact clusters in the local universe , the so - called `` super star clusters '' ( sscs ) that have properties consistent with those expected for adolescent globular clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the discovery of sscs precipitated a major shift in our understanding of the conditions required for globular cluster formation .",
    "although the evidence connecting young sscs and ancient globular clusters is compelling , a critical issue remains : modern day sscs and ancient globular clusters were formed in environments with very different metallicities .",
    "we have not yet observationally constrained what effect low metal abundances had on the formation of massive star clusters .",
    "much effort has gone into understanding the formation of the _ first _ stars in the universe ( e.g. those stars formed out of truly primordial material , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it is clear that metallicity has a critical role in this regime .",
    "even moderately low metal abundances may affect star formation in a number of ways , including dust formation , cooling and pressure , and the hardness of the resulting stellar spectra .",
    "in an effort to investigate massive star cluster formation in an environment similar to that which might be found in primordial galaxies during the time ancient globular clusters were prolifically formed , we have targeted the galaxy sbs  0335 - 052 ( e ) for a detailed multi - wavelength study .",

    "here we present new near - infrared and archival optical high - resolution observations of sbs 0335 - 052 with the goal of studying ssc formation and evolution at low metallicity .",
    "near - ir observations are particularly important for probing the dusty birth environments of embedded massive star clusters , and the wavelength range of @xmath15 m is well - suited to assessing a cluster s evolutionary state because it samples the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) at the nexus of emission between dust and stellar light .",

    "this would help explain the large extinction derived from the mid - ir spectral energy distributions .",
    "also , if the extinctions inferred from the mid - ir describe absorption from dust clumps rather than a screen of dust , they may actually underestimate the absorption because of beam dilution effects .",
    "in addition , diffuse dust in the interclump regions could provide the modest reddening measured at optical wavelengths ( since the optical light only emerges through the low extinction regions ) .",

    "moreover , the extinction curve in sbs 0335 - 052 appears to be anomalous .",
    "it is roughly constant up to @xmath92 m with @xmath93 , then drops to @xmath94 at @xmath95 m .",
