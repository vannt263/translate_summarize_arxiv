    "production of a @xmath14 meson pair , the zweig - favored decay mode of @xmath4 mesons , is not energetically possible for resonances below the @xmath4(4s ) , thus the decay of the @xmath4(1s ) meson must proceed through zweig - suppressed channels . since the charge conjugation quantum number of the @xmath4 resonances is c=1 , the three lowest - order hadronic decay modes of the @xmath4(1s ) meson are those into three gluons ( @xmath15 ) , the vacuum polarization qed decay @xmath16 , and two gluons plus single photon ( @xmath17 ) . for the @xmath4(2s ) and @xmath4(3s ) resonances , direct radiative transitions , both electromagnetic and hadronic , compete with these annihilation modes . since @xmath18 and @xmath19 the ratio of the decay rates from these two processes can be expressed in terms of the strong coupling constant@xcite : @xmath20.\\ ] ] in this expression , the bottom quark charge @xmath21 .",
    "alternately , one can normalize to the well - measured dimuon channel@xcite and cancel the electromagnetic vertex : @xmath22 .    in either case , one must define the value of @xmath12 appropriate for this process .",
    "although the value @xmath23 seems ` natural ' , the original prescription of brodsky _",
    "et al._@xcite gave @xmath24 for @xmath4(1s)@xmath25 .",
    "theory prescribes the differential spectrum @xmath26 ( @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is defined as the polar angle relative to the @xmath29 beam axis ) .",
    "the limited angular coverage of the high - resolution cleo  iii photon detection , as well as the large backgrounds at low momentum due to decays of neutral hadrons ( primarily @xmath3 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) to photons , plus the large number of radiated final state ` fragmentation ' photons in this regime limit our sensitivity to the region defined by @xmath330.7 and @xmath340.4 .",
    "we must therefore rely on models for comparison with the observed direct photon spectrum and extrapolation of the direct photon spectrum ( excluding the fragmentation component ) into lower - momentum and larger polar angle regions .",
    "originally , the decay of the ground - state vector @xmath35 bottomonium into three vectors ( both @xmath36 as well as @xmath37 ) was modeled in lowest - order qcd after similar qed decays of orthopositronium into three photons , leading to the expectation that the direct photon spectrum should rise linearly with @xmath38 to the kinematic limit ( @xmath39 ) ; phase space considerations lead to a slight enhancement exactly at the kinematic limit@xcite .",
    "koller and walsh considered the angular spectrum in detail@xcite , demonstrating that as the momentum of the most energetic primary parton ( photon or gluon ) in @xmath40 or @xmath36 approaches the beam energy , the event axis tends to align with the beam axis : @xmath41 .",
    "field@xcite argued that @xmath42 is non - physical , since it corresponds to a recoil @xmath43 system with zero invariant mass , while the recoil system must have enough mass to produce on - shell final state hadrons . using a phenomenological parton shower monte carlo technique which took into account the correlation of photon momentum with recoil hadronization phase space ,",
    "field predicted a significant softening of the lowest - order qcd predicted spectrum , with a photon momentum distribution peaking at @xmath44 rather than @xmath39 .",
    "( in the limit of completely independent fragmentation , the same argument , in principle , would apply to 3-gluon decays . )",
    "this result seemed in conflict with the extant cusb@xcite data , which indicated a spectrum more similar to the lowest - order qcd prediction .",
    "a subsequent measurement by cleo - i@xcite , however , favored field s softened spectrum over lowest - order qcd . given the poor resolution of the cleo - i electromagnetic calorimeter , that measurement was also consistent with a subsequent modification to lowest - order qcd which calculated corrections at the endpoint@xcite by summing leading logs of the form ln(1-@xmath38 ) .",
    "higher statistics measurements by crystal ball@xcite as well as argus@xcite corroborated this softened photon spectrum . a subsequent cleo analysis ( cleo - ii)@xcite , based on @xmath451  m @xmath4(1s ) events , provided a high - statistics confirmation of a photon spectrum peaking at @xmath44 , and was able to trace the direct photon momentum spectrum down to @xmath460.4 ; at that momentum , the direct photon signal becomes less than 10% relative to the background , whereas the systematic errors on the background estimate in that momentum region exceed 10% .",
    "are considerably larger than those statistical errors .",
    "this is a point that was not made strongly enough in the past , encouraging various theoretical fragmentation models to be tested against those direct photon data at low @xmath38 values . ]",
    "contemporary with the cleo - ii analysis , catani and hautmann first pointed out complications due to the presence of fragmentation photons emitted from final  state light quarks downstream of the initial heavy quarkonia decay@xcite ( essentially final state radiation ) .",
    "these can dominate the background - subtracted spectra for @xmath470.4 and therefore ( if not corrected for ) lead to an over - estimate of the @xmath4(1s)@xmath25 branching fraction , and an underestimate of the extracted value of @xmath48 .",
    "hoodbhoy and yusuf@xcite also performed a rigorous calculation of the expected @xmath4(1s)@xmath25 decay rate , by summing all the diagrams contributing to the direct photon final state and treating hard and soft contributions separately .",
    "rather than assuming that the decay occurs via annihilation of two at - rest quarks , the authors smear the annihilation over a size of order @xmath49 , with a corresponding non - zero velocity .",
    "although their calculation results in some softening of the photon spectrum relative to the lowest - order qcd prediction , it is unable to entirely account for the softening observed in data , leading to the conclusion that final - state gluon interactions are important , particularly near the photon endpoint .",
    "fleming and leibovich@xcite considered the photon spectrum in three distinct momentum regions . at low momentum ( @xmath50 ) , final - state radiation effects dominate . in the intermediate momentum regime ( 0.3@xmath510.7 )",
    ", they applied the operator product expansion ( ope ) to the direct photon spectrum of @xmath4 decay , with power - counting rules prescribed by non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) , and retained only the lowest - order color singlet terms in @xmath52 . in the highest - momentum regime ( @xmath53 ) , a soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) for the light degrees of freedom combined with non - relativistic qcd for the heavy degrees of freedom was used to obtain a prediction for the photon spectrum which qualitatively described the essential features of the cleo - ii data , despite peaking at a higher value of @xmath38 than data .",
    "the same approach was later applied by fleming to decays of the type @xmath54+x , given the similarity to @xmath55(1s)@xmath56+x , and including the color - octet contributions to @xmath57 production@xcite .",
    "very recently , garcia and soto ( gs@xcite ) have also produced a parameterization of the expected photon momentum spectrum in the @xmath4 system .",
    "following fleming and leibovich , they also remedy the inability of non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) to model the endpoint region by combining nrqcd with soft - collinear effective theory , which allows calculation of the spectrum of the collinear gluons resulting as @xmath39 .",
    "they make their own calculation of the octet contributions ( in both s- and p- partial waves ) to the overall rate , obtaining a spectral shape prediction similar to fleming and leibovich ( claimed to be reliable in the interval 0.65@xmath580.92@xcite ) after adding color - octet , color - singlet , and fragmentation contributions .",
    "for @xmath590.65 , garcia - soto consider the fragmentation contribution `` significant '' compared to the direct photon spectrum . for @xmath600.92 , the calculation becomes less reliable ; in this high - momentum regime , the possibility of two - body decays : @xmath61 , with @xmath62 some resonant hadronic state , will also lead to distortions of the expected spectrum .",
    "contributions from such possible two - body decays may also result in a slight underestimate of the extracted value of @xmath48 .",
    "garcia and soto have also pointed out the possibility of different calculational regimes for @xmath4(1s)@xmath7 , compared to @xmath4(2s)@xmath7 and @xmath4(3s)@xmath7 , given the difference in the principal quantum numbers , and therefore the average radial interquark separation . since the field model is based on simple gluon - gluon fragmentation phase space arguments , it does not distinguish between direct photons from any of the three @xmath4 resonances .",
    "the analysis , in general terms , proceeds as follows . after selecting a high - quality sample of @xmath29 annihilations into hadrons , we plot the inclusive isolated photon spectrum in data taken at both on - resonance and off - resonance energies .",
    "a direct subtraction of the off - resonance contribution isolates the photon spectrum due to @xmath4 decays .",
    "the background from decays of neutral hadrons into photons ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 ) produced in @xmath4 decays to @xmath15 , @xmath17 , or @xmath67 is removed statistically using a monte carlo generator developed specifically for this purpose , and based on the assumption that the kinematics of charged and neutral hadron production can be related through isospin conservation . for each charged pion identified in the data ,",
    "we simulate a two - body decay of one of the neutral hadrons enumerated above .",
    "the measured four - momentum of that charged pion is then used to boost the daughter photons into the lab frame . after correcting for efficiency , and scaling by the expected rate of neutral hadron production relative to charged pion production ( for @xmath3 s ,",
    "the simple isospin assumption would be @xmath681/2 ; for the other neutral hadrons , we use ratios relative to charged pions as derived in our previous analysis@xcite ) and the appropriate branching fractions , a background `` pseudo - photon '' spectrum is created . after subtracting all backgrounds ,",
    "the remaining photon spectrum is interpreted as the direct photon spectrum , which must then be extrapolated into low - photon momentum and high @xmath28 regions ( for which the backgrounds are prohibitively large ) in order to determine an estimate of the full production rate . in this analysis",
    ", we employ the models by field and garcia - soto for integration purposes , given their acceptable match in spectral shape to previous data .",
    "although no predictions exist for direct photon decays of the @xmath4(2s ) and @xmath4(3s ) resonances , we nevertheless use these same models to determine total direct photon decay rates in the case of these higher resonances .",
    "a comparison of the shapes of these models is shown in figure [ fig : fieldgs ] .",
    "the cleo  iii detector is a general purpose solenoidal magnet spectrometer and calorimeter .",
    "elements of the detector , as well as performance characteristics , are described in detail elsewhere @xcite . for photons in the central `` barrel '' region of the cesium iodide ( csi ) electromagnetic calorimeter , at energies greater than 2 gev",
    ", the energy resolution is given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the shower energy in gev .",
    "at 100 mev , the calorimetric performance is about 20% poorer than indicated by this expression due to the material in front of the calorimeter itself . the tracking system , ring imaging cerenkov detector ( rich ) particle identification system , and electromagnetic calorimeter are all contained within a 1 tesla superconducting coil .",
    "the data used in this analysis were collected on the @xmath4(1s ) resonance , center - of - mass energy @xmath71 gev , the @xmath4(2s ) resonance , center - of - mass energy @xmath72 gev , and the @xmath4(3s ) resonance , center - of - mass energy @xmath73 gev . in order to check our background estimates , we used continuum data collected just below the @xmath4(1s ) resonance , center - of - mass energy @xmath74 gev @xmath75 gev , below the @xmath4(2s ) resonance , center - of - mass energy @xmath76 gev @xmath77 gev , below the @xmath4(3s ) resonance , center - of - mass energy @xmath78 gev @xmath79 gev and below the @xmath4(4s ) resonance , center - of - mass energy @xmath80 gev @xmath81 .    to obtain a clean sample of hadronic events , we selected those events that had a minimum of four high - quality charged tracks ( to suppress contamination from qed events ) , a total visible energy greater than 15% of the total center - of - mass energy ( to reduce contamination from two - photon events and beam - gas interactions ) , and an event vertex position consistent with the nominal @xmath29 collision point to within @xmath82 cm along the @xmath29 axis ( @xmath83 ) and @xmath112 cm in the transverse ( @xmath84 ) plane .",
    "we additionally veto events with a well - defined electron or muon , or consistent with a @xmath85 `` 1-prong vs. 3-prong '' charged - track topology .",
    "our full data sample is summarized in table i.    [ tab : data ]    .summary of data used in analysis .",
    "different running periods are designated by capital roman letters . for each data",
