    "deep surveys of the night - sky have uncovered a large population of disk galaxies with properties quite different from those of the extensively studied `` normal '' high surface brightness ( hsb ) galaxies .",
    "these so - called low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies have , as their name already implies , surface brightnesses much lower than what was until quite recently assumed to be representative for disk galaxies ( freeman 1970 ) .",
    "the lsb galaxies we will be discussing are generally dominated by an exponential disk , with scale lengths of a few kpc .",
    "morphologically they form an extension of the hubble sequence towards very late - type galaxies .",
    "observations suggest that lsb galaxies are unevolved galaxies , as shown by e.g. the sub - solar metallicities ( mcgaugh 1994 ) and the colors ( mcgaugh & bothun 1994 ; de blok et al .",
    "1995 ; van den hoek et al .",
    ".    the evolutionary rate of a galaxy may in fact be reflected in its surface brightness .",
    "for example , the gas fraction ( @xmath1 ) increases systematically with surface brightness , from a few percent for early type spirals to much higher values approaching unity for late type lsb galaxies ( @xcite ) . in many lsb galaxies",
    "the gas mass exceeds the stellar mass ( even for such extreme assumptions as maximum disk ) .",
    "it is still unclear what the physical driver is for the difference between hsb and lsb galaxies .",
    "investigations of their dynamics , using hi observations ( de blok et al .",
    "1996 ) , suggest that lsb galaxies are low - density galaxies ( de blok & mcgaugh 1996 ) .",
    "this is one of the favored explanations for the low evolution rate of lsb galaxies ( see e.g.  van der hulst et al .",
    "1987 ) , as this implies a large dynamical time - scale . environment may also play a role .",
    "tidal interactions with other galaxies increase star formation rates .",
    "this may not happen in lsb galaxies which are found to be isolated ( mo et al .",
    "1994 ) . in lsb galaxies a few star forming regions are usually found .",
    "these are distributed randomly over the galaxies and do not trace the spiral arms .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to investigate whether the low density alone can explain the properties of lsb galaxies .",
    "we use 3d numerical simulations to address this problem .",
    "the dynamical simulations include both stars and gas and incorporate a parameterized description of star formation , including feedback on the gas .",
    "the prescription of star formation in numerical simulations is not straightforward , given the limited resolution of the models and the fragmentary knowledge about the physics governing star formation on kpc scales . in the literature various different star formation algorithms can be found .",
    "for instance , friedli & benz ( 1995 ) use a criterion based on the toomre stability parameter @xmath2 ( toomre 1964 ) to study star formation in barred systems ; mihos & hernquist ( 1994a , b , 1996 ) adopt a schmidt law based on the gas density [ star formation rate ( sfr ) @xmath3 to study mergers of galaxies ; others require gas to be in a convergent and jeans unstable flow to form stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we employ the method of gerritsen & icke ( 1997 , 1998 ) , which uses a jeans criterion to define star forming regions , coupled with an estimate of the cloud collapse time . in these simulations gas",
    "is treated fully radiative with allowed temperatures between 10 k and @xmath4 k ; cooling is described by standard cooling functions , heating is assumed to be provided by far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) radiation and mechanical heating from stars . in this way",
    "the simulated interstellar medium ( ism ) mimics a multi - phase ism ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is an improvement over other simulations which try to create a multi - phase ism but do not allow radiative cooling below @xmath5 k ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the multi - phase ism allows us to restrict ourselves to considering only relatively cold ( @xmath6 k ) regions as the sites for star formation .    here",
    "we apply this method to study the ism and star forming properties of lsb galaxies , and our results will be valid under the assumption that the physical processes governing star formation are the same for hsb and lsb galaxies .",
    "we test whether a low mass - density is sufficient to explain the properties of lsb galaxies by discussing two different models of a specific lsb galaxy : the first model has the cooling properties of a solar abundance ism , while in the second model the cooling efficiency is lowered , thus mimicking a metal - poor ism .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "[ numtech ] we describe the numerical techniques .",
    "the construction of a model lsb galaxy is presented in sect .",
    "[ galmod ] .",
    "this galaxy model is evolved for a few gyr , using two different prescriptions for the cooling properties of the gas ( sect .  [ evolution ] ) .",
    "the implications of the simulations are discussed in sect .",
    "[ discus ] .",
    "we conclude this paper with a summary in sect .",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "we model the evolution of galaxies using a hybrid _ n-_body / hydrodynamics code ( treesph ; hernquist & katz 1989 ) .",
    "an extensive description is given in gerritsen & icke ( 1997 , 1998 ) . a tree algorithm",
    "( @xcite ; @xcite ) determines the gravitational forces on the collision - less and gaseous components of the galaxies .",
    "the hydrodynamic properties of the gas are modeled using smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the gas evolves according to hydrodynamic conservation laws , including an artificial viscosity for an accurate treatment of shocks .",
    "each particle is assigned an individual smoothing length , @xmath7 , which determines the local resolution and an individual time step .",
    "estimates of the gas properties are found by smoothing over 32 neighbors within @xmath8 .",
    "we adopt an equation of state for an ideal gas .",
    "we allow radiative cooling of the gas according to the cooling function for a standard hydrogen gas mix with a helium mass fraction of 0.25 ( @xcite ) .",
    "radiative heating is modeled as photo - electric heating of small grains and pahs by the fuv field ( @xcite ) , produced by the stellar distribution .",
    "all our simulations are advanced in time steps of @xmath9 yr for star particles , while the time steps for sph particles can be 8 times shorter ( @xmath10 yr ) .",
    "the gravitational softening length is 150 pc .",
    "a tolerance parameter @xmath11 is used for the force calculation , which includes quadrupole moments .",
    "gerritsen & icke ( 1997 , 1998 ) extensively describe the recipe for transforming gas into stars and the method for supplying feedback onto the gas .",
    "the recipe works well for normal hsb galaxies , with the energy budget of the ism as prime driver for the star formation .",
    "the simulations allow for a multi - phase ism with temperature between @xmath12 k. this allows us to consider cold @xmath6 k regions as places for star formation ( giant molecular clouds in real life ) . below we summarize the important ingredients of the method .    from our sph particle distribution we select conglomerates where the jeans mass is below the mass of a typical giant molecular cloud .",
    "in the simulations performed here we use @xmath13 for this aggregate mass ( the method is not very sensitive to the exact value for this mass ) .",
    "the jeans mass depends on the local gas properties and is calculated from the sph estimates of the density @xmath14 and sound speed @xmath15 , @xmath16 with @xmath17 the constant of gravity . during the simulations the maximum number density achieved is of the order 1 @xmath18 .",
    "it follows that only regions below @xmath19 k are unstable and may form stars .",
    "we follow unstable regions during their dynamical and thermal evolution and if an sph particle resides in such a region longer than the collapse time , @xmath20 half of its mass is converted into a star particle .",
    "experiments with a different number of particles and different star formatin efficiencies show no dependence on these parameters , as already shown in gerritse & icke ( 1997 ) .",
    "important for our calculations is that we consider star particles as stellar clusters with an age .",
    "thus for each individual star particle we can attribute quantities like the sn - rate , the mass loss , and the fuv - flux , according to its age .",
    "we use the spectral synthesis models of bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) to determine these quantities , where we adopt a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) with slope 1.35 and with lower and upper mass limits of @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively .    the radiative heating for a gas particle is calculated by adding the fuv - flux contributions from all stars , which is done together with the force calculation . the mechanical luminosity from a star particle",
    "is determined by both the sn - rate and the mass loss rate .",
    "we assume that each sn injects @xmath23 ergs of energy and that the energy injected by stellar winds is @xmath24 , with @xmath25 the wind terminal velocity and @xmath26 the stellar mass loss . for massive stars",
    "@xmath25 depends critically on the stellar mass , luminosity , effective temperature , and metallicity ( e.g.  leitherer et al .",
    "1992 ; @xcite ) . for simplicity",
    "we adopt @xmath27 km / s .",
    "after @xmath28 yr the last @xmath29 stars explode and no more mechanical energy is supplied to the gas .",
    "thus we return mechanical energy from massive stars into the ism , and ignore the mechanical energy from low mass stars .    in the simulations the parent sph particle is the carrier of the mechanical energy from the new star particle .",
    "this sph particle ( `` sn particle '' ) mimics a hot bubble interior .",
    "radiative cooling is temporarily switched off ( the resolution does not allow the creation of a low - density , hot bubble ) , the temperature of the sn particle is set to the mechanical energy density ( of a few @xmath30 k ) , and the particle evolves adiabatically . the first @xmath4 yr , the position and velocity of the sn particle are equal to the position and velocity of the associated star particle . afterwards",
    ", the sn particle evolves freely .",
    "after @xmath31 yr radiative cooling is switched on again , and the particle behaves like an ordinary sph particle .",
    "there are many ways to construct model galaxies . for our purpose",
    "we prefer to build a galaxy model after an existing galaxy with well - determined properties . here",
    "we choose lsb galaxy f563 - 1 ; this galaxy is a late - type lsb galaxy , representative of the field lsb galaxies found in the survey by schombert et al .",

    "this is one of the most persistent problems in analyzing the dynamics of galaxies , and , unfortunately , the present observations do not provide a unique answer for this stellar disk mass - to - light ratio @xmath45 . rather than using the so - called `` maximum disk '' value @xmath46 , which is an upper limit to the possible values of @xmath45 , we adopt a value based on colors and velocity dispersions of @xmath47 . an extensive motivation for this choice",
    "is given by de blok & mcgaugh ( 1997 ) .",
    "the implications of choosing a different value of @xmath45 for the evolution of the stellar disk will be discussed in sect.[sfhist ] .",
    "the stellar disk particles are distributed radially according to the ( measured ) surface density profile .",
    "we adopt a vertical distribution of the form sech@xmath48 ( e.g.  van der kruit & searle 1982 ) , with a constant vertical scale height @xmath49 kpc the disk is truncated at 25 kpc .",
    "the luminosity yields a total stellar mass of @xmath50 .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the stars is fixed via the relation @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the stellar surface density .",
    "this implies a stability parameter @xmath53 throughout for the disk ( dotted line in fig .",
    "[ qtoomre ] ) .",
    "particle velocities are assigned according to the ( gas ) rotation curve corrected for asymmetric drift .",
    "dispersions in @xmath54 directions are drawn from gaussian distributions with dispersions of @xmath55 respectively , using the relations valid for the solar neighborhood @xmath56 with @xmath57 and @xmath58 the orbital and epicyclic frequencies respectively .",
    "the gas surface density distribution is modeled after the hi distribution .",
    "the total gas mass is @xmath59 ( this is the total hi mass multiplied by 1.4 to include he ) ; the surface density decreases almost linearly with radius out to 33 kpc .",
    "the vertical distribution is assumed to decline exponentially .",
    "the scale height @xmath60 of the gas layer can be calculated using @xmath61 ( @xcite ) where @xmath62 km / s is the ( adopted ) gas velocity dispersion .",
    "the gas particles are assigned velocities according to the rotation curve , with isotropic dispersion @xmath63 .",
    "the halo is included in the calculations as a rigid potential .",
    "this is justified since the galaxy model evolves in isolation .",
    "we will thus also ignore any contraction of the halo under the influence of the disk potential .",
    "we do not expect this effect to be important anyway as the mass of the disk ( assuming @xmath47 ) is only 4 per cent of the measured halo mass ( de blok & mcgaugh 1997 ) .",
    "as advantages we do not have to make assumptions about halo particle orbits , and we do not have to spend time in calculating the force of the halo particles on the galaxy . we assign an isothermal density distribution to the halo , @xmath64 with central volume density @xmath65 and core radius @xmath66 kpc .",
    "these are the values derived from a rotation curve decomposition assuming @xmath67 .",
    "this will correctly put the maximum rotation velocity at 113 km / s .    for the simulations we use 40,000 sph particles and 80,000 star particles initially .",
    "this corresponds to an sph particle mass of @xmath68 and a star particle mass of @xmath69 .",
    "we can show that a maximum disk value for @xmath45 is not a plausible option for our modeling exercise , and that in fact the `` most likely '' value we use in constructing models may still overestimate the true value of @xmath45 , making the stellar disk a really insignificant component of the whole galaxy system .",
    "the star formation history of galaxies is commonly parameterized by an exponential function : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the star formation time scale ( e.g.  guiderdoni & rocca - volmerange 1987 and @xcite ) .",
    "this ignores any gas locked up in long - lived stars , but this effect will not be important in lsb galaxies due to their large gas - fractions .",
    "a small value for @xmath71 means that star formation proceeds rapidly , while a large @xmath71 indicates that star formation proceeds very slowly .",
    "for hsb galaxies the star formation time scale is normally a few gyr ( @xcite ) . for f563 - 1",
    "the measured current sfr as derived from h@xmath32 imaging is approximately @xmath72/yr ; this yields a star formation time scale of 77 gyr .",
    "thus star formation in this disk proceeds much slower than in hsb galaxies .    since we know the stellar and gas mass , and hence the total disk mass @xmath73 of the galaxy",
    ", we can use the exponential parameterization and the known sfr to compute the `` age '' @xmath74 of the disk ( i.e.  the time elapsed since star formation started ) :    @xmath75    for the adopted stellar mass of f563 - 1 eq .  [ mstar ] yields an age for the galaxy of 37 gyr , much larger than the age of the universe .",
    "=    if the exponentially declining sfr describes the star formation history adequately and the galaxy is not in a state of unusually low star formation activity ( note that the blue colors for these lsb galaxies suggest a relatively _ high _ current star formation activity ) , then the old implied age of the disk could mean that the mass of the disk should in reality be even less .    =    we show this in fig .",
    "[ m2l ] where we present a few solutions for eqs .",
    "[ ages ] & [ mstar ] for various values of the sfr .",
    "if we adopt @xmath72/yr as the true sfr then @xmath76 if the galaxy is 15 gyr old .",
    "higher values for @xmath45 would make the galaxy older than the universe . a maximum disk solution ( @xcite ) for the stellar mass - to - light ratio yields @xmath77 , which leads to an age of 110 gyr .",
    "a current sfr of order @xmath78/yr is needed to reconcile the maximum disk with the exponentially declining sfr model , which implies that the measurements underestimate the true sfr by an order of magnitude .",
    "thus seems highly unlikely ( it would give lsb galaxies sfrs comparable to those of actively star forming late type galaxies ) , and therefore we reject the maximum disk as an acceptable solution for the stellar disk mass .",
    "the adopted @xmath47 which we use in the galaxy model is only consistent with the age of the universe if the true sfr is of order @xmath79/yr , otherwise the stellar mass is probably overestimated .",
    "however if the stellar disk is indeed less massive than our galaxy model , then any conclusions concerning the disk stability and thickness of the disk will be even stronger .",
    "it might be argued that the exponential star formation history is not the right choice for this type of galaxy , and that other functional forms of star formation history , in combination with the measurements , will yield reasonable ages .",
    "this is not true , as any other ( reasonable ) star formation history will result in even larger ages for the disk .",
    "taking for example another extreme functionality  a constant sfr of 0.05 @xmath38/yr  yields an age @xmath80 gyr .",
    "the only way to get a reasonable age , given the measured luminosity and assumed @xmath45 , is to assume that the current sfr in f563 - 1 ( and lsb galaxies in general ) has been underestimated , which is unlikely .",
    "we refer to mcgaugh & de blok ( 1997 ) for an extensive discussion on the various functionalities of the star formation history .",
    "we therefore conclude that the disk of f563 - 1 must have a small stellar mass - to - light ratio .",
    "in this section we demonstrate that the low density as found in lsb galaxies , by itself is not sufficient to reproduce the low observed sfrs of lsb galaxies . _",
    "low metallicity gas is required to explain the properties of lsb galaxies . _    to show this we construct two model galaxies using the structural parameters of f563 - 1 .",
    "model @xmath81 represents an lsb galaxy with a solar metallicity gas .",
    "although we use the structural parameters relevant for f563 - 1 , the model is in effect a model hsb galaxy , which is `` stretched out '' to give the low ( surface ) densities found in lsb galaxies .",
    "this model therefore tests the low - density hypothesis .",
    "the other model , @xmath82 , has the same structural parameters as @xmath81 , but in addition we lowered the cooling efficiency of the gas below @xmath5 k by a factor of seven . cooling below @xmath5 k",
    "is dominated by metals , so lowering the efficiency is equivalent to lowering the metallicity by an equal amount .",
    "model @xmath82 thus most closely approximates what is currently known observationally about lsb galaxies . in summary",
    "we adopt the cooling function of a solar abundance gas in model @xmath81 .",
    "this cooling function is later changed in model @xmath82 to simulate the effects of low metallicity .",
    "we assume that the physics regulating the star formation is the same for lsb and hsb galaxies , and therefore use the star formation recipe described in section 2 and applied to hsb galaxies in gerritsen & icke ( 1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "after initialization we let the two model galaxies evolve for 2.3 gyr .",
    "the models rapidly settled into equilibrium , any longer time interval would have produced identical results .    in this section",
    "we first discuss the evolution of the stellar disk .",
    "the stellar disk evolves rather independently from the gas disk and star formation .",
    "hence we effectively explore the consequences of the disk / halo decomposition , notably on the stability and thickness of the stellar disk .",
    "second , we discuss the evolution of the sfr with time for both simulations . for a physical interpretation of the difference in sfrs we present phase diagrams of the ism in both simulations .",
    "figure [ qtoomre ] shows the stability parameter @xmath2 for the stellar disk at @xmath83 gyr ( that is 2 gyr after the start of the simulation which started at @xmath84 ) , where @xmath2 is defined as @xmath85 with @xmath58 the epicycle frequency ( @xcite ) .",

    "the scale height of the stellar disk decreases by approximately a factor of 1.3 .",
    "the initial scale height corresponded to the scale height of an sc galaxy ( van der kruit & searle 1982 ) .",
    "the final axial ratio for the galaxy model is about 15 . as particle scattering during the simulation tends to increase the thickness of the disk ,",

    "the sfr varies on time scales of a few tens of myr and the amplitude of these variations can exceed @xmath92/yr .",
    "the rapid variability in the sfr is due to the discrete nature of star formation in our simulation .",
    "new star particles have a mass of approximately @xmath93 and thus represent ( large ) stellar clusters . in this way our simulations incorporate the idea that most stars in real galaxies form in stellar clusters .",
    "for a small number of star forming regions ( as in lsb galaxies ) this will in real life also lead to a rapidly fluctuating , but on average low sfr .    in simulation",
    "@xmath82 the strength of the star formation peak is large compared to the average sfr .",
    "these fluctuations in star formation activity will actually dominate the color of the galaxy , with large fluctuations giving rise to blue colors .",
    "the same star formation fluctuations will also be present in hsb galaxies , but due to the higher sfr the large number of fluctuations will give the impression of a high , relatively constant sfr .",
    "we thus find that it is not so much the absolute value of the average sfr which determines the colors , but the contrast of any sf fluctuation with respect to the average sfr .",

    "quantitatively , the cold gas fraction ( @xmath94 k ) makes up 37% of the total gas mass in simulation @xmath81 and only 4% in simulation @xmath82 .",
    "this reflects the cooling properties of the gas : in simulation @xmath82 seven times less heat input is required to keep the gas at @xmath5 k as in simulation @xmath81 .",
    "consequently simulation @xmath82 contains virtually only a warm , one - phase ism .",
    "the simulated absence of metals prevents the ism from cooling efficiently .",

    "the amount of cold molecular gas in sites for star formation would thus be negligible . from these models",
    "we expect the disks of lsb galaxies to contain only negligible amounts of molecular gas .",

    "how will the edge - on surface brightness distributions of lsb galaxies compare with those of hsb galaxies of similar scale length ? compared to an equally large hsb galaxy , the scale height of an lsb galaxy is smaller . due to the low dust content in lsb galaxies ( mcgaugh 1994 ) , effects of edge - brightening will be stronger in the lsb galaxy compared to the dust - rich hsb galaxy .",
    "an edge - on lsb might have a higher apparent surface brightness than an edge - on hsb galaxy of the same size .",

    "the lsb galaxies in their sample are found to be almost transparent with a differential extinction of only @xmath101 mag arcsec@xmath100 .",
    "the almost two magnitudes extra extinction in the hsb can thus easily compensate the few magnitudes difference in _ intrinsic _ surface brightness , making edge - on lsb galaxies as bright in surface brightness as edge - on hsb galaxies .",
    "hence it is much more difficult to distinguish between edge - on lsb and hsb galaxies than between face - on lsb and hsb galaxies",
    ". a smaller number of star forming regions , extreme flatness and blue colors will be the only easily visible distinguishing characteristics .",
    "the reason why the stellar disks of lsb galaxies are so thin is that they are very stable to local instabilities ( fig .",
    "[ qtoomre ] ) . as a consequence , bars and spiral structure , which are the most efficient methods for heating a stellar disk ( sellwood & carlberg 1984 ) , are unlikely to develop spontaneously in lsb galaxies .",
    "thus there is no natural way to make the disks thick .",
    "this explanation is supported by the rarity of barred lsb galaxies . in the lsb galaxy catalog by impey et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , only 4 percent of the galaxies are barred , while the frequency of barred galaxies in the rc2 is some 30 percent ( @xcite ) .",
    "sellwood & wilkinson ( 1993 ) give a fraction of 2/3 for barred hsb galaxies .",
    "the stability of lsb disks is confirmed in a numerical study of the dynamical stability of these systems by mihos et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . whereas we adopted the `` most likely '' solution for the mass - to - light ratio of stellar disk",
    ", these authors considered the `` worst case '' scenario of maximum disk .",
    "however their conclusion is the same as ours : the disks of lsb galaxies are extremely stable .    the lack of truly lsb edge - on galaxies ( schombert et al .",
    "1992 ) could tell us something about the existence of very lsb galaxies . as shown above , the presently known population of lsb galaxies , when turned edge - on , brightens to surface brightnesses comparable to those of similar - sized hsb galaxies . in principle , the edge - on counterparts of the currently known lsb galaxies should thus already be in the conventional galaxy catalogs , showing up as `` streaks on the sky '' . as truly lsb edge - on galaxies",
    "seem to be lacking from the lsb catalogs , this suggests that galaxies with face - on surface brightnesses @xmath102 mag arcsec@xmath100 are probably very rare .",
    "fluctuations in the sfr as shown in fig .",
    "3 , may very well explain why most of the lsb galaxies detected in surveys are blue .",
    "as mcgaugh ( 1996 ) argues , the selection effects against finding red lsb galaxies on the blue sensitive plates on which surveys have been carried out are quite severe .",
    "it will be very hard to find lsb galaxies with colors @xmath103 or redder .",
    "so if the absence of red lsb galaxies from the current catalogs is caused purely by these selection effects , the blue lsb galaxies could simply be the bursting tip of a proverbial iceberg .    in order to explain the colors of the bluest lsb galaxies in the sample of de blok et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , van den hoek et al .",
    "( 1997 ) had to invoke bursts with a duration of between 0.5 and 5 myr and an amplitude between 1 and 5 @xmath104/yr .",
    "the fluctuations found in our simulation @xmath82 have an amplitude of 0.15 @xmath104/yr , with a duration of about 20 myr .",
    "this duration is determined by the lifetime for ob stars and the collapse time for molecular clouds , which are both of the order of a few @xmath4 yr .",
    "they are therefore slightly milder than the bursts invoked by van den hoek et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , but keep in mind that the latter bursts were used to explain the _ bluest _ galaxies .",
    "our models attempt to simulate an average lsb galaxy , and it should not come as a surprise that the fluctuations we find are milder .",
    "given the many assumptions and uncertainties in both modeling and observations , it is actually quite encouraging that the parameters agree to within an order of magnitude .",
    "assuming that blue lsb galaxies are currently undergoing a period of enhanced star formation , implies that there exists a population of _ red , non - bursting , quiescent _ lsb galaxies .",
    "these should then also be metal - poor and gas - rich , and share many of the properties of the galaxies we have been modeling .    we can estimate the fraction of red lsb galaxies by calculating the distribution of the birthrate parameter @xmath105 for simulation @xmath82 .",
    "the @xmath105 parameter is the ratio of the present sfr over the average past sfr and is a useful tool for studying the star formation history of galaxies .",
    "birthrate parameters have been determined for a large sample of spiral galaxies by kennicutt et al .",
    "the trend is that early type galaxies have small values for @xmath105 , thus most star formation occurred in the past , while late type and irregular galaxies have large values for @xmath105 , often exceeding 1 , indicating that those galaxy are still actively forming stars , and more so than in the past . here",
    "we apply this analysis to simulation @xmath82 in order to estimate the fractions of blue and red lsb galaxies .    =    in fig .",
    "[ bhist]a we plot the distribution of @xmath105 values for simulation @xmath82 ( solid line ) , where we have followed the value of @xmath105 over the duration of the simulation in steps of 15 myr . thus if the sfr peaks in a particular time interval , the corresponding value of @xmath105 will be high . if the sfr is low in this time interval @xmath105 is also low . in total",
    "we have 200 @xmath105 values .",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "[ bhist]a are the @xmath105 distribution for a simulation of an hsb sc galaxy ( @xcite , dotted line ) and the mean values for different galaxy types ( from @xcite ) . due to the low average sfr",
    "the distribution for the lsb simulation is much broader than the distribution for the hsb simulation , and the average @xmath105 value is larger .",
    "also it is clear that the lsb galaxy has @xmath105 values larger than the average for early type galaxies for most of the time .",
    "`` classical '' lsb galaxies are blue compared to hsb galaxies , they thus have an excess of recent star formation or equivalently a higher @xmath105 value .",
    "we now define a lsb galaxy to be `` blue '' if its birthrate parameter @xmath105 exceeds the average value of @xmath105 for a hsb late - type galaxy ( see @xcite for relations between birthrate parameter and color ) .",
    "[ bhist]a shows that this requires that @xmath106 .",
    "lsb galaxies that do not meet this requirement are `` red '' : non - bursting , but nevertheless still gas - rich . from fig .",
    "[ bhist]b ( which shows the cumulative @xmath105 distribution ) we can see that over 80 percent of the fluctuations result in blue lsb galaxies .",
    "less than 20 percent of the fluctuations therefore results in red lsb galaxies .",
    "we can estimate colors of the red population using the burst models from van den hoek et al .",
    "for example , a 5 myr burst with an amplitude of 3 @xmath104/yr superimposed on a 13 gyr old population which has undergone an exponentially decreasing sfr with a timescale of 4 gyr changes colors and surface brightnesses by @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 ( cf .",
    "table 5 in van den hoek et al . ) . using these values together with the measured colors of the bluest lsb galaxies in de blok et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , yields @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 for the red population .",
    "a recent ccd survey ( oneill & bothun 1997 ) has picked up a class of lsb galaxies which have @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "if some of these galaxies are indeed the non - bursting counterparts of the blue lsb galaxies , they should be metal - poor and gas - rich , and share many of the properties of the galaxies we have been modeling .    in summary , if the blue colors found in lsb galaxies are the result of fluctuations in the star formation rate , then this implies that the red gas - rich lsb galaxies constitute less than 20% of the gas - rich lsb disk galaxies .",
    "this does not rule out the existence of a population of red , gas - poor lsb galaxies .",
    "these must however have had an evolutionary history quite different from those discussed here and possibly have consumed or expelled all their gas quite early in their life .",
    "the sfrs from both simulations are larger than the observed rate of about @xmath72/yr .",
    "this latter value is probably correct within a factor of 2 .",
    "especially the high sfr of simulation @xmath81 ( @xmath116/yr ) is almost an order of magnitude larger than what is needed and it seems impossible to reconcile this value with the observations . instead the global sfr is consistent with the global sfr for equal - luminosity galaxies ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "for instance the sc galaxy ngc 6503 with a maximum rotation velocity of @xmath117 km / s has a total measured sfr of @xmath78/yr , and a simulated sfr of @xmath118/yr ( @xcite , 1998 ) . in general the sfrs of",
    "equal - luminosity galaxies differ by a factor 10 between lsb and hsb galaxy ( @xcite , and kennicutt 1983 ) , despite the copious amounts of gas available in the lsb galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "sfr@xmath119 approaches the correct value and the physical reason is shown in fig .",
    "the essential information to retain from this phase diagram is that we need a different ism for lsb galaxies , where the bulk of the gas is not directly available for star formation , as it is too warm ( of order @xmath5 k ) .",
    "the simulations do not include phase transitions from neutral to molecular gas , but as an estimate for the h@xmath120 mass we can consider all star forming gas ( @xmath121 k ) to be molecular .",
    "this gas represents less than 2% of the total gas mass . in this respect",
    "it is interesting to note that for a small sample of lsb galaxies co is not detected , yielding an limit of m(h@xmath120)/m(hi ) @xmath122 30 percent ( @xcite , schombert et al .",
    "a few galaxies have upper limits less than 10% .",
    "as discussed in the previous section the warm ism may be caused by a low metallicity for the gas .",
    "below @xmath5 k , cooling is dominated by heavy elements like c@xmath123 , si@xmath123 , fe@xmath123 , o. if these elements are rare then it is difficult for the gas to radiate its energy away .",
    "direct observational support for a low metallicity ism in lsb galaxies comes from oxygen abundance measurements of hii regions in lsb galaxies .",
    "those studies yield metallicities of approximately 0.5 times solar metallicity ( @xcite )",
    ". measurements of the oxygen abundance in f563 - 1 ( de blok & van der hulst 1998a ) give an average oxygen abundance of 0.15 @xmath124 ( compare with the difference in metallicity between models @xmath81 and @xmath82 ) .    a point of concern is the imf .",
    "our premise is that the imf is universal , however it can differ from our adopted salpeter imf ( see [ starform ] ) . especially a low upper - mass cutoff could easily lead to an underestimation of the sfr ( e.g.  an upper mass cutoff at 30 @xmath38 reduces the measured sfr by 2 - 3 ; @xcite ) .",
    "however current determinations of the imf in external galaxies point towards a universal imf ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , observations suggest that massive stars _ are _ present in the hii regions of lsb galaxies ( mcgaugh 1994 ) .",
    "what causes the low evolution rate for lsb galaxies ?",
    "the low density has often been invoked to explain this , since the dynamical time scales with @xmath125 .",
    "this scenario is exactly what is tested in simulation @xmath81 .",
    "the only difference with a normal hsb galaxy is the scale length of the galaxy , which is for instance three times larger than the scale length for the equally bright galaxy ngc 6503 .",
    "the result is striking : adopting `` standard '' values for the star formation process results in a sfr identical to the rates of hsb galaxies .",
    "thus the low density in itself seems not capable of doing the job , and we have to rely on a scarcity of heavy elements to reproduce a true lsb galaxy .",
    "this fits in logically with the notion that stars are the producers of these elements ; the low star formation activity prevents metal enrichment of the ism .",
    "it implies that the sfr has been low throughout the evolution of lsb galaxies , and that these galaxies are `` trapped '' in their current evolutionary state : low density prevents rapid star formation , which prevents enrichment of the ism , which prevents cooling , resulting in a warm one - phase ism .",
    "so although the lack of metals is directly responsible for the low sfr , the low density may ultimately determine the fate of lsb galaxies .      1 .",
    "* dominant halo : * the dominance of the dark matter halos in lsb galaxies ( de blok & mcgaugh 1997 ) results in very thin and stable disks .",
    "the major over minor axis ratios of the stellar disks are larger than 15 .",
    "lack of dust in lsb galaxies will result in edge - on lsb galaxies having apparent surface brightnesses equal to those of edge - on hsb galaxies of similar size .",
    "the lack of truly lsb edge - on galaxies may indicate that disk galaxies with @xmath126 mag arcsec@xmath100 are rare .",
    "* low metallicity : * modeling the low sfr found in lsb galaxies , demands that the metallicity in the ism must be approximately 0.2 solar , which is consistent with observation by mcgaugh ( 1994 ) and de blok & van der hulst ( 1998a ) .",
    "these low metallicities prevent effective cooling so that the ism in lsb galaxies primarily consists of warm ( @xmath127 k ) gas .",
    "the amount of cold ( molecular ) gas is probably less than 5% of the hi mass , supporting claims by schombert et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and de blok & van der hulst ( 1998b ) who derive small molecular gas fractions . 3 .   * low average sfr : * due to the fluctuations in the sfr in lsb galaxies and their large contrast with the average sfr",
    ", the spread in colors among lsb galaxies will be larger than among hsb galaxies .",
    "from the distribution of birthrate parameters in our simulations we deduce that , if the currently known blue _ gas - rich _ lsb galaxies are the most actively star forming lsb galaxies , they constitute over 80 percent of the total population of _ gas - rich _ field lsb disk galaxies .",
    "this implies that there is at most an additional 20 percent of quiescent , gas - rich lsb disk galaxies .",
    "this does not preclude the existence of an additional red , gas - poor population . however",
    "this population must have an evolutionary history quite different from that described in this work .",
