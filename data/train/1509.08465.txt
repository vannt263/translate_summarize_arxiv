    "in june 2013 , brazil faced the largest and most significant mass protests in a generation , comparable in size to the protests that triggered the collapse of the military dictatorship in 1984  @xcite .",
    "the 2013 protests had been exacerbated by the broader disenchantment of the population towards the party system in brazil  @xcite .",
    "banners with sentences such as `` no party represents me '' or `` we do nt have a party , we are brazil ! ''",
    "were commonly seen among the protesters . in response to these protests ,",
    "the government proposed a program of political reform  @xcite .",
    "however , more than one year has passed and very little has been done .",
    "why are people so unhappy with the brazilian party system ? to illustrate its incapability , consider the following examples .",
    "19 months before rio de janeiro stages south america s first olympic games , an evangelical pastor without any link to sports was nominated as brazil s new sports minister .",
    "he replaced communist aldo rebelo , who oversaw preparations for the world cup and was highly criticized for subsidizing the construction of white - elephant football stadiums  @xcite .",
    "aldo rebelo , who in 1994 proposed a bill that prohibits the adoption of any technological innovation in local , state and federal agencies , is , ironically , brazil s new minister of science and technology .",
    "moreover , in 2010 elections , tiririca , a well known entertainer whose career began as a circus clown in brazil , was first elected to represent so paulo in congress , winning the most votes of any candidate in the country with the slogans `` it ca nt get any worse '' and `` what does a congressman do ?",
    "in fact , i do not know , but vote for me and i will tell you '' .",
    "one of the main causes of brazil s political inefficiency is its highly fragmented party system  @xcite .",
    "this is a system with many political parties and with no one party being able to obtain an absolute majority in the representative assembly .",
    "the more fragmented the party system is , the less likely it is that the president s party will control a majority of seats in the legislature .",
    "therefore , presidents are usually forming informal coalition governments , needing to build cross - party coalitions to implement most major policies  @xcite . under these circumstances , many ( if not most ) deputies spend the bulk of their time arranging jobs and pork - barrel projects for their constituents in exchange for legislative support  @xcite .",
    "also , parties rarely organize around national - level questions , which means that congress rarely deals with serious social and economic issues  @xcite . as a consequence , individualism , clientelism , and personalism , rather than programmatic appeals ,",
    "dominate electoral campaigns  @xcite .",
    "more generally , party system fragmentation impacts the electoral dynamic , the process of coalition formation , governing , and ultimately , the survival of political systems in presidential democracies  @xcite . in brazil",
    ", party system fragmentation has reached one of the highest levels ever found in the world  @xcite .",
    "after 2014 elections , the number of parties represented in congress grew from 23 to 28 .",
    "besides brazil , many countries have party systems with high levels of fragmentation , such as bolivia , bulgaria , denmark , ecuador , finland , france , guatemala , india , israel , italy , netherlands and thailand  @xcite . in theory ,",
    "the number of parties of a country can be explained by its electoral and social structures  @xcite . with regard to the electoral structure , while plurality elections favor two - party competition , proportional representation ( pr ) electoral systems create fragmented party systems  @xcite . concerning the social structures , the more socially heterogeneous a country is , the more electoral parties it will have  @xcite .",
    "social heterogeneity is measured either by the number of linearly independent ideological dimensions ( e.g. religious and socio - economic ) being discussed in the society or the number of social cleavages ( e.g. centre - periphery and state - church ) a country has  @xcite .",
    "thus , is it possible to measure if a fragmented party system is a reflex of a socially heterogeneous society ? in this direction , how can we determine whether an electoral system is optimally fragmented ? and",
    "if it is not optimally fragmented , how can we optimize it ? to answer these questions ,",
    "i propose _ arrange _ , a _",
    "d**a**ta d**r**iven method fo**r * * * * a**ssessing and reduci**ng * * party fragm**e**ntation_in a country . , _",
    "arrange_uses as input the roll call data , i.e. , the votes given by congressmen on bills and amendments , as a proxy for political preferences and ideology .",
    "the idea , regularly employed by political scientists  @xcite , is that congressmen who give the same vote regularly share the same political ideology and , therefore , should belong to the same party . using this insight , _ arrange_reorganizes the party system of a given country by trying to find the minimum amount of social cleavages that divides its congressmen into coherent voting blocks , i.e. , sets of congressmen whose members votes similarly .",
    "these coherent voting blocks would be the new political parties of the analyzed country and would allow us to assess its actual level of fragmentation .",
    "if _ arrange_divides the congressmen into a much lower number of political parties than the actual number , then it is possible to conclude that party fragmentation in this particular country is much higher than it should be . if this is the case , _",
    "arrange_immediately provides a new congressmen  party configuration",
    "that both reduces the country s level of party fragmentation and increases intra - party similarity , which could potentially increase the efficiency of the party system  @xcite . in summary ,",
    "the main contributions of this paper are :",
    "from roll votes primarily focuses on the estimation of cleavages and ideologies across congressmen and parties  @xcite to characterize and predict legislative behavior  @xcite . recently , with the advancement of political weblogs and online social networks , researchers are also extracting political knowledge from user generated data on the web .",
    "there are studies that focus on mining political opinions  @xcite and profiles  @xcite from the texts users post on social media applications .",
    "others , such as  @xcite , extract political opinions from general texts , such as statement records of u.s .",
    "senators and online news .",
    "more recently , leman akoglu  @xcite classified the political polarity of individuals using roll call votes of u.s .",
    "congressmen and texts posted on political forums .",
    "the idea behind all these studies is that political preferences tend to be stable over time and can be predicted accurately .    .",
    "within this sub - field , since duverger s seminal paper  @xcite , many studies focused on predicting and understanding the factors that determine the number of parties that compete in a given polity  @xcite . in summary , there are two lines of thought : one that emphasizes the role of electoral laws in structuring coalition incentives , and another that emphasizes the importance of preexisting social cleavages .",
    "another fundamental problem in this sub - field is to count the number of parties by taking into account their relative size  @xcite .",
    "if , for instance , a party has a very small percentage of seats in congress ( e.g. one seat of one thousand ) , then it should be counted accordingly .",
    "the metric that considers this is called _ the effective number of parties_. conceptually , the effective number of parties is simply the number of `` viable '' or `` important '' political parties in a party system that includes parties of unequal sizes .",
    "since laakso and taagepera s seminal work  @xcite , several ways of computing the effective number of parties were proposed  @xcite .",
    "the number of effective parties is a frequent metric for assessing party system fragmentation in a country  @xcite .",
    "the high interest in these problems comes from the fact that the actual number of parties usually determines the number of _ effective _ parties , or how _ fragmented _ a party system is  @xcite .",
    "highly fragmented party systems can affect governance drastically  @xcite .",
    "the more fragmented the party system is , the less likely it is that the president s party will control a majority of seats in the legislature .",
    "simone bohn  @xcite reviewed the literature and concluded that party system fragmentation impacts the electoral dynamic , the process of coalition formation , governing , and ultimately , the survival of political systems in presidential democracies .",
    "thus , in this paper , we measure party fragmentation by counting both the actual and the effective number of parties .",
    "another crucial factor for governance is party discipline , i.e. , the ability of a political party to get its members to support the policies of their party leadership .",
    "mainwaring and shugart  @xcite assessed the effects of this on the costs of governing . if parties are not disciplined , presidents will be forced to rely on ad - hoc coalitions based on the distribution of patronage to individual legislators , which raises the costs of governing and reduces policy coherence .",
    "limongi and figueiredo  @xcite argued that `` institutional engineering '' should focus on electoral formulas that reduce party fragmentation and increase party discipline .",
    "brazil is a special case in politics for its high level of party fragmentation , being consistently analyzed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "thus , using brazil as the use case makes this work specially challenging but rewarding .",
    "all the data used in this work was collected from the open data ( _ dados abertos _ ) project of the house of representatives ( or chamber of deputies ) of brazil . in total",
    ", i collected roll votes on bills of @xmath0 thousand congressman that worked in the house of representatives of brazil from november , 4th , 1998 to december , 3rd , 2014 .",
    "the reason for this particular time interval is related to the purpose of this work . since party discipline is a fundamental metric of evaluation , i only collected the bills in which the party leaders declared the desired vote for their fellow partisans .",
    "more than @xmath1 of the votes given during this period had a declared party leader vote .",
    "moreover , note that congressmen vote for bills and their amendments .",
    "an amendment is a proposition presented as ancillary to the bill , to amend its form or content .",
    "thus , bills and amendments compose a total of thousand propositions to be voted by the congressmen .",
    "each congressman may or may not agree with the vote of his / her party leader .",
    "there are , in total , thousand declared votes of the leaders of the 36 parties that had congressmen elected for the house of representatives during the analyzed period .",
    "as discussed previously , reducing party fragmentation only makes sense if party discipline does not decrease significantly .",
    "one way to measure the discipline of a congressman is to compute the fraction of votes given by him / her through his political life that agreed with his / her party leader .",
    "however , in brazil it is common for congressmen to switch parties .",
    "also , it is well known that some parties demand ( or inspire ) higher levels of discipline than others  @xcite .",
    "thus , instead of analyzing the discipline of the whole political life of a congressman , i will analyze his / her discipline as a member of a single party , i.e. , a congressman may have different levels of discipline if he / she was member of different parties during his / her political life . for",
    "simplicity , from now on i will assume that the vote given by the leader of the party was given by the party itself , e.g. , i will call _ party vote _ the vote given by the leader of the party .",
    "thus , given the set of @xmath2 congressmen @xmath3 and the @xmath4 political parties that compose the set @xmath5 , i define a * partisan * @xmath6 as the tuple formed by a congressman @xmath7 and a political party @xmath8 .",
    "the set containing all @xmath9 partisans is defined as @xmath10 .",
    "these partisans job is to vote for the set @xmath11 of @xmath12 bills and amendments that were put to vote in the house of representatives during the analyzed period . from now on",
    ", i will use the term * propositions * to refer to both bills and amendments . since",
    "a partisan @xmath13 had not necessarily voted for all propositions , i define the set @xmath14 as the set of propositions that were voted by partisan @xmath13 .",
    "i also define @xmath15 as the set of partisans which are members of party @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath16 .",
    "before the partisans give their votes for a given proposition @xmath17 , their parties have to announce their votes for @xmath17 . again , since a party @xmath8 had not necessarily voted for all propositions , i define the set @xmath18 as the set of propositions that were voted by party @xmath8 . for each proposition @xmath19 of a given party @xmath8 , there is a vote @xmath20 associated with it . in the same way , for each proposition @xmath21 of a given partisan @xmath13 , there is a vote @xmath22 associated with it .",
    "thus , a party @xmath8 and a partisan @xmath13 have , respectively , a set of votes @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the set of all votes given by partisans and parties is simply @xmath27 .",
    "a vote @xmath20 given by party @xmath8 on a proposition @xmath17 may be of four types : _ y _ ( yes ) , _ n _ ( no ) , _ o _ ( obstruction ) and _ f _ ( free ) , i.e. , @xmath28 .",
    "if the vote is @xmath29 ( @xmath4 ) , the party approves ( disapproves ) the proposition . if the vote is @xmath30 , the party is trying to avoid the vote on the proposition , i.e. , its partisans are called to withdraw from the plenary",
    ". finally , if the vote is @xmath31 , its partisans are free to vote at will .",
    "similarly , a partisan @xmath13 vote @xmath32 on a proposition @xmath17 may be of three types : _ y _ , _ n _ and _ o _ , i.e. , @xmath33 . if the vote is @xmath29 ( @xmath4 ) , the partisan approves ( disapproves ) the proposition .",
    "if the vote is @xmath30 , the partisan withdrew from plenary .    in this work ,",
    "the vote is the fundamental feature that determines a preference or ideology .",
    "since for all propositions in our dataset we have both the vote of the partisan and the party , here i define a general function @xmath34 that receives two votes as input and outputs @xmath35 if the votes are in accordance or @xmath36 otherwise .",
    "this function is defined as :    @xmath37    note that both @xmath38 and @xmath39 can be a vote of a partisan or a party .",
    "also note that a @xmath31 vote implies accordance , since the party that gave that vote does not particularly care about its members votes .",
    "once we know how to compare votes , we can propose a way to compare the similarity @xmath40 between two vote sets @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "it is given as : @xmath43    in summary , @xmath40 sums all the votes in agreement between the vote sets @xmath41 and @xmath42 considering only the propositions that are in both sets . from equation  [ eq : sim ] , we can define the three levels of discipline that we will use throughout this paper .",
    "first , i define * partisan discipline * as the discipline @xmath44 of a partisan @xmath6 towards his / her party @xmath8 , calculated as : @xmath45 second , i define * party discipline * as the discipline @xmath46 throughout all the votes that were given by partisan members of the party @xmath8 , calculated as : @xmath47 finally , i define * overall discipline * as the discipline @xmath48 throughout all the votes given in the house of representatives during the analyzed period , calculated as : @xmath49 \\in \\mathcal{a}}{|\\mathcal{b}_a|}\\times d_{a\\rightarrow p}}{\\sum_{[a:=(u , p ) ] \\in \\mathcal{a}}|\\mathcal{b}_a| } \\label{eq : overaldiscipline}\\ ] ]",
    "in this section i will show a summarized view of the fundamental characteristics of brazilian party system that are relevant to the purpose of this work .",
    "s.    fig .",
    "[ fig : partysize ] , i show the historical participation of all parties in the house of representatives during the analyzed period . _ party participation _",
    ", which i will interchangeably call _ party size _ , is represented by the total number of propositions that were voted by the members of the party ( horizontal axis ) and the total number of partisans that are and were members of the party ( vertical axis ) .",
    "observe the heterogeneity of this universe .",
    "from the three biggest parties ( pmdb , psdb and pt ) , with hundreds of partisans who voted for thousands of propositions , to the two smallest ones ( pstu and pmr ) , which together have only three partisans and propositions , there are another @xmath50 parties with very distinct levels of representation .    in order to verify",
    "if there is any correlation between participation and party discipline , i show in fig .",
    "[ fig : partydiscipline ] , for each party @xmath8 , the total number of votes given by partisans members of @xmath8 ( horizontal axis ) and the party discipline @xmath46 ( vertical axis ) .",
    "note that there is no apparent relationship between party discipline and participation .",
    "in fact , the pearson s correlation coefficient between party discipline and the total number of votes is , but since the @xmath51 for testing the hypothesis of no correlation is , we can not affirm the correlation is significant . nevertheless , as already observed by  @xcite using a smaller dataset ,",
    "party discipline in brazil is consistently high : no party has a historical party discipline below @xmath52 and only parties have a figure below @xmath53 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : partisandiscipline ] , we show the behavior of partisans discipline in brazil during the analyzed period .",
    "first , observe in fig .",
    "[ fig : partisandiscipline]a the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of all partisans disciplines .",
    "note that the curve representing partisan discipline in brazil is not very far away from the ideal curve , where all partisans have discipline of @xmath54 .",
    "thus , together with party discipline , partisan discipline is also usually high in brazil : only @xmath55 of partisans have discipline lower or equal to @xmath56 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : partisandiscipline]b , we plot the heatmap of partisans using their disciplines and total number of votes .",
    "the color bar at the right indicates the number of partisans in a given area of the map .",
    "observe that the vast majority of partisans are located in the upper - right of the heatmap , i.e. , they have given many votes and have high partisan discipline .",
    "although party fragmentation in brazil has reached one of the highest levels ever found in the world  @xcite , we have seen that party and partisan discipline is consistently high .",
    "does this mean that the level of party fragmentation in brazil is necessary ? according to the seminal _ doctrine of responsible party government _",
    "@xcite , parties must differ sufficiently between themselves , providing the electorate with a proper range of choice between alternative actions . given that ,",
    "i reformulate the previous question : is the actual level of party fragmentation in brazil a consequence of a high number of sufficiently different parties ?    instead of performing a deep clustering analysis to answer this question",
    ", i will apply the principal component analysis ( pca )  @xcite technique to the matrix @xmath57 composed by the voting vectors @xmath58 of each partisan @xmath59 .",
    "pca is a widely used statistical technique for unsupervised dimension reduction .",
    "it transforms the data into a new coordinate system such that the greatest variance is achieved by projecting the data into the first coordinate , namely principal component , the second greatest variance is achieved by projecting into the second coordinate , the second component , and so on .",
    "in order to draw more interesting conclusions from this analysis , i will also apply pca to the matrix @xmath60 composed by the voting vectors of the u.s .",
    "congressmen . for this",
    ", i will use the same dataset used in  @xcite , which consists of votes on 1655 bills in the house of representatives in years 2009 - 2010 by 451 representatives . in the matrices",
    "the @xmath61 votes are represented as @xmath35 , the @xmath62 votes as @xmath63 , and the @xmath31 , @xmath30 and non - attendance as @xmath36 . to make the comparison more precise",
    ", i will only use the votes in years 1999 - 2000 for constructing @xmath57 .",
    "this period comprises votes on the bills by 767 contemporary partisans of 18 parties in the first two years of president cardoso in power .",
    "also , it is the two year period that gives the higher explained variance by the first two components of the pca .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pca ] , i show the first two components of the pca for both @xmath57 and @xmath60 , where each point represents a congressman and each symbol represents a party .",
    "observe that , for both usa and brazil the first two components explain a significant part of the variance : @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "however , only the usa pca can visually divide the members of different parties . for brazil",
    ", many members of different ( same ) parties are located together ( apart ) .",
    "this suggests that parties in brazil are not sufficiently different to justify one of the highest levels of party fragmentation ever found in the world  @xcite .",
    "in this section i describe the method _ arrange _ , which has , basically , two steps .",
    "first , based on the votes given by party leaders , it tries to find pairs of parties that can be merged into one .",
    "the idea is that parties that always give the same vote could be merged into a single party .",
    "then , _ arrange_attempts to assign partisans to new parties with the objective of minimizing the total number of parties receiving partisans and preserving party discipline .",
    "finally , i describe the quality outputs of _ arrange_. formally , the problem tackled by _",
    "arrange_is :    given a set of parties @xmath66 , a set of partisans @xmath67 , a set of bills and amendments @xmath68 and the set of all votes given by parties and partisans @xmath27 , find the minimum set of parties @xmath69 to which the partisans in @xmath67 can be assigned in a way that overall , party and partisan disciplines are maximized .",
    "[ problem1 ]      in order to assign partisans to other parties , it is necessary to formally define the ways it can be done .",
    "thus , here i define an * option * as the descriptor of the party that can receive an external partisan as member . more formally , given a partisan @xmath70 , his / her current party @xmath71 , and his / her set of propositions @xmath72",
    ", an option @xmath73 is a tuple composed by the partisan @xmath13 , a party @xmath74 , and the similarity value @xmath75 between @xmath13 and @xmath76 .",
    "more importantly , the option @xmath77 exists _ if and only if _ @xmath78 , i.e. , if the party @xmath76 has voted for all propositions in @xmath72 . the set @xmath79 is composed by all the options of partisan @xmath13 or , more formally    rcl _ a & = & \\{[o_a : = ( a:=(u , p_i ) , p_j , sim(a , p_j ) ) ]  : + & & p_i , p_j   p_j p_i   _ a _",
    "p_j}.    moreover , an option @xmath73 of partisan @xmath70 is characterized as a _ good option _ if @xmath80 .",
    "the set of good options @xmath81 for partisan @xmath70 is defined as    rcl _ a^ * & = & \\{[o_a = ( a:=(u , p_i ) , p_j , sim(a , p_j ) ) ] _ a  : + & & sim(a , p_j ) sim(a , p_i ) } [ eq : goodoptions ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : numberofoptions]a , i show the histogram of the number of good options @xmath82 for all partisans of our dataset .",
    "consistent with the high levels of party and partisan discipline , observe that the majority of partisans do not have a single good option , i.e. , for @xmath83 of the partisans there is no other party in brazil that offers more similar voting vectors .",
    "in fact , only @xmath84 of the partisans have more than three good options .",
    "this result suggests that it is very difficult to reduce the number of parties in brazil by moving partisans from one party to another .",
    "the main reason for the low number of good options is related to the short lifetime of many parties in brazil , as it can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : partysize ] . since an option exists if and only if the propositions voted on by the partisan is a subset of the propositions voted on by the parties , many partisans with a long history of votes can not find options for them among the small parties . thus",
    ", here i propose a method for creating new parties by merging existing ones .",
    "the method is based on a simple idea : if two parties are not contemporary or are contemporary , but all votes given by them are equal , then these parties can be merged into a new one .    more formally , two parties @xmath71 and @xmath76 can be merged into a new party @xmath85 if one of the two conditions below is met :    * * c1 .",
    "* @xmath86 , i.e. , parties @xmath71 and @xmath76 have not voted for a common proposition . *",
    "* c2 . * @xmath87 ,",
    "i.e. , parties @xmath71 and @xmath76 have given the same vote for all common propositions .    given these two conditions ,",
    "the first thing we have to do is find all pairs of parties to which at least one of the two conditions is valid .",
    "once this is done , for every pair of parties @xmath88 that can be merged , we create a merged party @xmath89 , for which the sets of propositions and votes are , respectively , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "all parties created in this step are put in set @xmath92 .",
    "after this , we repeat this process by verifying , for each party @xmath93 , all parties @xmath94 that can be merged to @xmath8 .",
    "we merge @xmath8 to @xmath95 into @xmath89 as previously , but this time adding the merged parties to @xmath96 .",
    "once this process is done , we copy @xmath96 to @xmath92 , empty @xmath96 , and restart the process of finding parties @xmath94 eligible to be merged to parties @xmath93 .",
    "the process ends when set @xmath96 does not receive a new merged party .",
    "all parties @xmath93 that were not merged are put in the final set of merged parties @xmath97 .",
    "this whole process is described in algorithm  [ alg : partymerger ] .",

    "it is well known that @xmath112 , making the worst - case complexity for this problem to be @xmath113 .",
    "nevertheless , in practice , finding parties in @xmath66 that can be merged with parties in @xmath92 gets significantly harder as @xmath114 increases , which , in practice , makes algorithm  [ alg : partymerger ] computationally feasible for the problem in question . for the case of the 36 brazilian parties ,",
    "@xmath114 went up to 6 and the algorithm stopped , generating a set @xmath108 containing 95 parties , in which only 5 were not a product of a merge , namely pdt , pmdb , pps , psdb and pt . besides these , algorithm  [ alg : partymerger ] generated 12 parties of size 2 , 17 parties of size 3 , 20 parties of size 4 , 31 parties of size 5 and 10 parties of size 6 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : numberofoptions]b , i show the histogram of the number of good options @xmath82 for all partisans considering the new set of merged parties @xmath108 .",
    "observe that the number of partisans that do not have a single good option dropped from @xmath115 to @xmath116 , all of them being members of the five parties that were not merged .",
    "moreover , the number of partisans that have more than three good options grew from @xmath117 to @xmath118 .",
    "thus , i conclude that merging parties significantly raises the chances of reducing the number of parties in brazil by moving partisans from one party to another without decreasing party discipline .",
    "now that most of the partisans have multiple good options , we can find ways of redistributing them among the parties in @xmath108 . the idea in this redistribution is to find a set of parties @xmath119 that has a lower cardinality than @xmath66 , i.e.",
    ", @xmath119 is a set of parties able to receive all partisans @xmath120 as members and the number of parties @xmath121 in @xmath69 has to be lower than the actual number of parties @xmath122 .",
    "however , this has to be done cautiously , since there are two partially conflicting goals :    1 .",
    "minimize the number of parties ; 2 .",
    "maximize party and partisan discipline .",
    "these goals are conflicting because minimizing the number of eligible parties to receive partisans as members implies reducing the options for moving partisans and , as a consequence , the number of good options .",
    "if a partisan does not have a good option , he / she is obliged to stay in his / her party in order to not decrease his / her partisan discipline . on the other hand , maximizing the discipline implies in maximizing the size of the set of good options and , therefore , the number of parties to be considered has to be as high as possible .    in order to solve this conflict ,",
    "i model this redistribution problem as a * set cover problem * ( * scp * )  @xcite .",
    "scp is a well studied problem for the field of approximation algorithms  @xcite , being also one of karp s 21 np - complete problems shown to be np - complete . in summary , given a set of elements @xmath123 ( called the universe ) and a set @xmath124 of @xmath12 sets whose union equals the universe , the scp is to identify the smallest subset of @xmath124 whose union equals the universe .",

    "are the partisans among parties , we compute the gini coefficient  @xcite for each configuration generated by _ arrange_and its competitors .",
    "the gini coefficient was initially proposed to describe the income inequality in a population  @xcite .",

    "random - sq_has a slightly high gini coefficient than the _ status quo_because a few big parties are more likely to randomly receive new partisans , since they appear as an option in the option sets @xmath130 for all @xmath120 .",
    "another relevant characteristic to be measured in political party systems is switching , i.e. , party changes among partisans . as stated by  @xcite",
    ", switching effectively destroys the meaning of party labels , raises voters information costs , and eliminates party accountability , being a threat to the very core of democratic representation .",

    "[ fig : npartiesperyear]a , i show the number of active parties per year for the _ status quo_and these three configurations .",

    "( i ) much more stable over the years and ( ii ) have a significantly smaller number of parties than the _ status quo_.",
    "besides counting the actual number of parties per year , it is also important to measure the _ effective number of parties_. as described previously , it is a concept which provides for an adjusted number of political parties in a country s party system , weighting the partisan count per party by their relative strength  @xcite . in our case , the relative strength refers to their seat share in the parliament .",
    "this measure is especially useful to detect trends toward fewer or more numerous parties over time  @xcite .",
    "the number of parties equals the effective number of parties only when all parties have equal strength . in any other case ,",
    "the effective number of parties is lower than the actual number of parties .",
    "it is also a frequent metric for the fragmentation of a party system  @xcite .",
    "moreover , although several indexes for computing the effective number of parties exist  @xcite , in this paper i use the _ golosov _ index @xmath200 , where @xmath4 is the actual number of parties , @xmath201 is the proportional share of each party @xmath71 , and @xmath202 is the highest share of a party  @xcite . for the best of my knowledge",
    ", @xmath203 is the most recent one and its results confirm it works better than earlier proposed alternatives in measuring the effective number of components in highly fragmented and highly concentrated party systems , which is the case of brazil .",

    "arrange_. moreover , if we consider only , brazil would go from having one of the most fragmented party systems in the world  @xcite to having one of the least fragmented  @xcite , averaging effective parties per year .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pca]b i showed the first two components of the pca for the matrix @xmath57 composed by the votes of the partisans of brazil during the years of 1999 and 2000 . in fig .",

    "observe that all three configurations have a visually better clustering of partisans of the same party than the _ status quo_. this suggests that _ arrange_is also able to provide configurations in which parties are more different among themselves than in the _ status quo_.",
    "i leave a deeper quantitative analysis for future work .",
    "in practical terms , the main contribution of _ arrange_to a government and its population is the ability to provide a quantitative assessment of fragmentation in its party system . given that the effective number of parties is expected to reflect the number of issue ( or ideological ) dimensions in a country  @xcite , highly fragmented party systems overestimate this number of issue dimensions , providing a distorted view to the population that harms democracy  @xcite .",
    "thus , by mapping plenary votes into ideological preferences , _ arrange_quantitatively provides an `` ideal '' number of parties for a country given the ideological preferences of its congressmen , revealing the _ presumable _ true number of issue dimensions that exists in this particular country .",
    "i used the expression `` _ _ presumable _ _ true '' because , as verified by  @xcite , it is not always true that a disciplined and cohesive party represents an ideological cleavage ( or group ) in society , i.e. , its members may simply be a group of congressmen obeying its leader in order to obtain a particular benefit .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that _ arrange_also provides the list of parties that should ideally exist and which partisans should be their members .",
    "although i know a democratic government can not implement this solution easily , it can be used to support significant reforms in its political system . with this in mind , i could not fail to mention in this paper that one of the possible reasons for brazil s high level of party fragmentation is the so called _ fundo partidrio _",
    ", which are funds distributed by the federal government to brazilian political parties for them to spend indiscriminately .",
    "a share of the amount paid by the federal government through the _ fundo partidrio _ is the same for every party , but another part is proportional to the number of elected congressmen , senators and governors by each organization . in 2014 , _ pt _ , the party with the highest share ( @xmath205 ) , received r@xmath206 million _ reais _ from the fund . on the other hand , _ pros _",
    ", the party with the lowest share ( @xmath207 ) , received r$493,873.68 thousand _ reais _ in 2014  @xcite .",
    "consider that , in 2014 , the exchange rate of the _ real _ varied from @xmath208 to @xmath209 u.s .",
    "it is out of the scope of this paper to point _",
    "fundo partidrio _ as the main culprit for brazil s high level of party fragmentation , but it poses as a clear incentive for the creation of many parties in brazil .    in spite of the fact that this work considers brazil as its use case",
    ", the methods and results shown here can be easily replicated to other countries that have highly fragmented party systems .",
    "carsten anckar studied party system fragmentation in 77 countries  @xcite and reported high levels of fragmentation for many countries besides brazil , such as bolivia , bulgaria , denmark , ecuador , finland , france , guatemala , india , israel , italy , netherlands and thailand . nevertheless , it is important to point out that this work was motivated and eased by the open data initiative of the brazilian government , that provides public data related to politics and also to many other areas , such as demographics , government spending , budget and road accidents .",
    "in this work , i proposed the method _",
    "arrange_to assess and reduce fragmentation in multi - party political systems . from roll votes data of partisans and their respective party leaders ,",
    "_ arrange_redistributes the partisans into new parties considering two conflicting objectives : to minimize the number of parties and to maximize party discipline . when applied to brazilian historical roll call data , _",
    "arrange_was able to generate distinct configurations that , compared with the _ status quo _ , have ( i ) a significantly smaller number of parties , ( ii ) higher discipline of partisans towards their parties and ( iii ) more even distributions of partisans into parties .",
    "these results show that brazil has and had many redundant parties , i.e. , parties that are very similar ideologically .",
    "thus , if today brazil has one of the highest levels of party system fragmentation in the world  @xcite , this work proved it could be much lower .",
    "finally , it is important to point out that _ arrange_is a general method and could be directly applied to analyze fragmentation in any of the many highly fragmented party systems that exists in the world  @xcite .",
