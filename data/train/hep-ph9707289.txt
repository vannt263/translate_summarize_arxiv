    "in perturbative qcd the scaling violations of the @xmath1 structure functions are caused by gluon bremsstrahlung from quarks and quark pair creation from gluons . in the low @xmath0 domain accessible at hera",
    "the latter process dominates the scaling violations . in this report",
    "i present preliminary results on the gluon momentum density extracted from a nlo qcd anlysis of @xmath1 structure functions measured by zeus in 1994 .    with the present integrated luminosity of about 20 pb@xmath4 at hera the region of large @xmath0",
    "( @xmath5 ) and @xmath3 ( @xmath6 gev@xmath7 ) becomes accessible .",
    "both zeus  @xcite and h1  @xcite have observed an excess of events compared to the standard model predictions in this hitherto unexplored region .",
    "the uncertainty in these predictions is dominated by that on the parton distributions in the proton .",
    "i will summarise the results of a qcd analysis by zeus of fixed target structure function data at high @xmath0 ( @xmath8 ) yielding an estimate of the experimental error on the nc born cross section of @xmath2 deep inelastic scattering at hera .",
    "the data used in the fit were the zeus 1994 nominal vertex data  @xcite which cover a kinematic range of @xmath9 and @xmath10  gev@xmath7together with the low @xmath3 measurements ( shifted vertex , isr )  @xcite .",
    "the latter datasets extend the kinematic range down to @xmath11 and @xmath12  gev@xmath7albeit with larger statistical and systematic errors .",
    "nmc data on @xmath13 and @xmath14  @xcite constrain the fit at high @xmath0 . to remove possible contributions from higher twist effects at large @xmath0",
    "the nmc data below @xmath15 gev@xmath7  were discarded .    at the input scale @xmath16 gev@xmath7 the gluon distribution ( @xmath17 ) , the singlet quark distribution ( @xmath18 ) and the difference of up and down quarks in the proton ( @xmath19 ) were parametrised as @xmath20",
    "the strange quark distribution was assumed to be 20% of the sea at @xmath15  gev@xmath7  @xcite .",
    "the sea quark density was otained by subtracting the valence ( taken from mrsd@xmath21 ) from the singlet distribution .",
    "the gluon normalisation , @xmath22 , was fixed by the momentum sumrule .",
    "the input value for the strong coupling constant was set to the result of ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath23 .",
    "the input parton distributions were evolved in nlo in the  scheme with @xmath24 light flavours . the charm contribution to the @xmath1 structure function",
    "was calculated in nlo from the evolved distributions as described in  @xcite with the charm mass set to 1.5  gev .",
    "contributions from bottom are estimated to be small and were neglected .",
    "in addition to the 11 parameters describing the parton distributions one ( two ) normalisation parameters for the zeus ( nmc ) data were left free in the fit . in the computation of the @xmath25 only statistical errors",
    "were taken into account . for each dataset",
    "the quantity @xmath26 ^ 2 $ ] was added where @xmath27 is the quoted normalisation error of the dataset .",
    "the fit yielded a good description of the data as shown in fig .",
    "[ mbb : fig1 ] . adding the statistical and systematic errors in quadrature the @xmath25 = 463 for 408 datapoints and 13 free parameters .",
    "the fitted normalisation parameters were 97.4% for zeus and",
    "( 99.3%,98.9% ) for the nmc 90  gev and 280  gev datasets respectively which is well within the quoted normalisation errors .    fig .",
    "[ mbb : fig2]a shows the gluon momentum denstity obtained from the fit at the input scale @xmath16 gev@xmath7 .",
    "the inner ( outer ) shaded band indicate the statistical and the statistical and systematic error added in quadrature . it is seen that at the lowest value of @xmath28 the gluon is determined with an accuracy of about  20% . at @xmath29 the total error is @xmath3012% which is a large improvement compared to the @xmath3050% error on the gluon distribution obtained from the qcd analysis of the zeus 1993 @xmath1 data  @xcite . at the input",
    "scale the momentum fraction carried by quarks ( gluons ) was found to be 0.555 ( 0.445 ) .",
    "the fitted values of the parameters describing the low @xmath0 behaviour of the quark singlet and the gluon distributions are @xmath31 and @xmath32 where the first error is statistical and the second systematic .    the gluon distribution evolved to @xmath33 gev@xmath7  is shown as the shaded ( total ) error band in fig .",
    "[ mbb : fig2]b . also plotted are the gluon densities from the recent parton distribution sets mrs(r1 )  @xcite , cteq4 m  @xcite and from grv(ho )  @xcite . whereas the agreement with mrs and cteq at low @xmath0 is excellent , the steep gluon obtained from the dynamical evolution by grv is inconsistent with the result of this analysis .",
    "in this section we describe a qcd analysis of high @xmath0 structure function data .",
    "the aim of this analysis is to estimate the experimental uncertainty on the @xmath34 neutral current ( nc ) cross - section at large @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "this error estimate is used in  @xcite to judge the significance of a possible excess of events observed at hera in this region  @xcite .",
    "the data used in the fit were the proton and deuteron @xmath1 data from slac  @xcite , bcdms  @xcite and nmc  @xcite together with @xmath37 from ccfr  @xcite .",
    "since we are only interested in the high @xmath0 domain , data below @xmath38 were discarded .",
    "also applied were the cuts @xmath39 gev@xmath7 and @xmath40 gev@xmath7 to remove target mass and higher twist effects . @xmath14 data above @xmath41",
    "were discarded to eliminate possible contributions from fermi motion in deuterium .",
    "the qcd analysis of these data is similar to that presented in the previous section except ( i )  the charm ( bottom ) quark distribution was generated dynamically from the threshold @xmath42 ( 25 ) gev@xmath7  ( ii )  no momentum sumrule was imposed ( iii )  all normalisations were kept fixed to unity and ( iv )  the valence quark distribution , constrained by the ccfr @xmath43 data , was left free in the fit with a functional form identical to that of @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ mbb : param ] ) . from the evolved quark distributions",
    "the @xmath1 , @xmath44 and @xmath43 structure functions in @xmath34 scattering were calculated in nlo including contributions from @xmath45 exchange and @xmath46 interference  @xcite .",
    "the experimental systematic errors were propagated to the covariance matrix of the fitted parameters using the technique described in  @xcite . in total 24 independent sources of systematic error",
    "were included taking properly into account the correlations between the systematic errors of the nmc datasets .      in fig .",
    "[ mbb : fig3]a we show the cross section for @xmath2 scattering at hera energies ( @xmath52 @xmath53 gev ) as a function of @xmath3 for fixed values of @xmath0 .",
    "the strong decrease in the cross section above @xmath54 gev@xmath7  is due to the contribution from @xmath43 . at high @xmath55 and @xmath36",
    "gev@xmath7 the error on @xmath56 is estimated to be about 9% , see table  [ mbb : tab1 ] .",
    "the estimated errors include ( small ) contributions from an assumed uncertainty of @xmath57 and an error of 50% on the strange quark content of the proton .         in fig .",
    "[ mbb : fig3]b the cross sections obtained from this analysis are compared to those calculated from the parton distribution sets mrsa  @xcite and cteq3 m  @xcite .",
    "it is seen that the differences are much smaller than the experimental errors : comparison of results obtained from different parton distribution sets do not yield a reliable estimate of the uncertainty in the cross sections .",
