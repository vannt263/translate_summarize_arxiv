    "when a ferromagnetic system is quenched to below the critical temperature a slow non - equilibrium phase - ordering process takes place with domains of the ordered phases increasing their size @xmath0 in time @xcite .",
    "typical examples are ferromagnets , binary liquids or alloys . when time is large , due to the presence of the dominant length scale @xmath0 dynamical scaling sets in  @xcite .",
    "the main features of this structure , which is quite well understood in non - disordered homogeneous systems , is expected to be valid also in the presence of quenched disordered or when homogeneity is spoiled .",
    "recently , this has promoted a considerable effort to understand coarsening phenomena in disordered and in non - homogeneous systems  @xcite .",
    "particular attention was devoted to the asymptotic growth law since , although a logarithmic behavior was generally expected , also a power - law sometimes was reported @xcite .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite some of us have studied a system - the site diluted ising model ( sdim ) - where , the interplay between logarithmic and power - law growth can be fully understood and the occurrence of the two types of behavior can be tuned by means of the amount of dilution . in the site",
    "diluted model ising spins are located on a substrate which is obtained from a regular lattice by removing randomly a fraction @xmath1 of sites . in",
    "the _ pure _ case with @xmath2 , the usual temperature - independent power - law @xmath3 is obeyed , where @xmath4 for a dynamics without conservation of the order parameter , as it will be considered here .",
    "increasing @xmath1 , a region with an asymptotic logarithmic behavior of @xmath0 is entered .",
    "however the situation changes when the critical value @xmath5 is reached , such that the fraction @xmath6 of spins is at the percolation threshold . in this case a temperature - dependent power - law @xmath7 is observed .",
    "this is interpreted as due to the different topology of the substrate , for @xmath8 and for @xmath5 , since in the former case it is compact on large scales , while in the latter it is a percolation fractal .",
    "notice that the critical temperature @xmath9 of the model , which is finite for @xmath8 , vanishes at the percolation threshold @xmath5 .",
    "the role of the substrate topology was also explored , in a different context , in @xcite where the coarsening of the ising model defined on deterministic fractal networks was considered .",
    "there it was shown that , again , two types of growth , logarithmic versus temperature dependent power - law , could be observed depending on the substrate considered . in particular , it was argued that logarithmic behavior is found on networks with a finite ising critical temperature , while temperature - dependent power laws are observed on structures with @xmath10 .",
    "the above findings suggest that the substrate topology , which is responsible for the existence of the equilibrium phase - transition , might also be important in determining the non - equilibrium growth - law , leading to the conjecture that temperature - dependent power - laws are to be expected on inhomogeneous or disordered systems with @xmath10 - like the sdim at the percolation threshold - while a logarithmic behavior occurs when @xmath11 , as in the same model with @xmath8 .    in the above mentioned cases",
    ", the ising model is constructed on a substrate with topological properties obtained by diluting the lattice either randomly or according to a deterministic rule .",
    "other thoroughly studied systems such as the ising model with random bonds or random fields are defined on homogeneous lattices . in these cases",
    "disorder pins the interfaces whose evolution becomes site - dependent and the growth - law is observed to be much slower than in the corresponding pure systems @xcite .    in this article , by studying an asymmetric version of the random - bond ising model , we argue that this is the case .",
    "we explicitly exhibit the parameters controlling the speed of growth and set them as to produce either a faster or a slower asymptotic growth law which are well compatible with an algebraic or a logarithmic behavior .",
    "these parameters have a clear geometrical interpretation in terms of topological properties of the bond network and , accordingly , one finds logarithmic or temperature - dependent power - law growths .",

    "this situation corresponds to a model with random coupling constants bi - modally distributed on the two possible values @xmath23 and @xmath24 occurring with probability @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively . therefore , this case corresponds to the ising model with @xmath24 and bond dilution , namely with a fraction @xmath25 of the bonds removed .      in the limit of low temperatures that we will always consider in this paper , the model depends only on @xmath25 and @xmath27 . in the parameter space ,",

    "[ phas_diag ] , only the region with @xmath28 , @xmath29 is allowed since @xmath25 is a probability and because we limit our analysis to non - negative coupling constants in order to avoid the different problem where frustration occurs ( notice that we use @xmath30 on the diagram axis instead of @xmath31 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ phas_diag ] the axes with @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 correspond to the pure ising model ( i.e. there is no disorder in the couplings ) .",

    "since @xmath39 is the bond percolation threshold , the system is at the percolation point of the substrate .",
    "let us recall here that the ising model defined on this percolative network is characterized by @xmath10 .",
    "this is due to the presence of the so called _ cutting bonds _",
    "@xcite , namely isolated bonds whose removal would cause the disconnection of arbitrarily large parts of the structure . in this sense",
    "the network is _ weak _ and we denote this point with the letter @xmath36 .",
    "notice that the region with @xmath40 , represented in brown in fig .",
    "[ phas_diag ] , is not interesting since on that sector the substrate is disconnected and asymptotic phase - ordering can not occur .",

    "it is useful to stress the close relation between the segment @xmath44 , @xmath45 of the present model and the sdim studied in @xcite .",
    "the latter has a fixed coupling constant but a fraction of spins is randomly removed with a probability @xmath1 ( we use capital @xmath1 to distinguish it from the arbim disorder parameter @xmath25 ) .",
    "arbim with @xmath46 differs from sdim because of bond dilution in place of site dilution . since we expect similar properties for the two systems it is useful to overview first the behavior of the sdim . in this model",

    "the substrate is disconnected and asymptotic coarsening can not occur , not differently from the arbim for @xmath25 above @xmath51 .",
    "in ref.@xcite it was shown that the sdim kinetic properties display a scaling structure which is most effectively described in terms of three competing fixed points on the @xmath1 axis , making free use of renormalization group terminology .",
    "the first is the trivial one of the pure system , located at @xmath47 , and is associated to the usual power - law growth @xmath52 .",
    "the second one is the _ percolative _ fixed point located at @xmath53 and is characterized by a temperature - dependent power - law growth @xmath7 .",

    "if the system is prepared with an intermediate dilution between @xmath47 and @xmath57 ( or equivalently between @xmath57 and @xmath53 ) a crossover is observed at a certain time @xmath58 from an initial transient regime governed by the nearest unstable fixed point ( @xmath47 or @xmath53 respectively ) , with a power - law increase of the domains size , to a late regime controlled by the attractive point at @xmath57 , characterized by a logarithmic @xmath0 . as a result , the slowest possible growth , namely the one where @xmath58 is smallest ,",

    "this can be used as a practical way to identify @xmath57 .",
    "since the only difference between the arbim with @xmath60 and the sdim is bond dilution replacing site dilution , we expect to observe the same pattern with an attractive fixed point associated to logarithmic growth and located somewhere in between @xmath32 and @xmath61 .",

    "we have checked that this is true also in the present study .    in our simulations",
    "we have used sufficiently large system sizes in order not to have any detectable finite - size effect in the range of time accessed in the runs .",

    "( [ lt ] ) simply states that the excess energy is stored on the interfaces whose density scales as the inverse of the size of the growing domains @xcite .    in the model considered here",

    "however the power - laws associated to the pure fixed point with @xmath32 or to @xmath36 may show up preasymptotically due to a crossover phenomenon .",
    "we have found that this same pattern persists also for @xmath131 .",

    "we have performed a series of numerical simulations of the deterministic fractal models described above by considering quenches to different final temperatures for a sg of @xmath150 sites , corresponding to a fractal network of the 11-th generation , and on a sc of @xmath151 sites , corresponding to a fractal of 7-th generation .",

    "let us start by recalling what is known for the phase - ordering of the ising model with a coupling constant @xmath153 on the usual sg .",
    "since this is a diluted structure with @xmath10 it can be considered to be comparable in some sense to the gsgim with the choice @xmath154 , namely at the point w. the ising model on the sg was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite where it was shown that @xmath0 grows as a power - law with a temperature dependent exponent @xmath155 .",
    "this has to be compared to what observed in the arbim at the fixed point w where , as shown in sec .",
    "[ eps1m2 ] , a similar power - law is observed . for low temperatures the algebraic behavior",
    "is decorated by a periodic oscillation which , as discussed in @xcite , is related to the recursive construction of the network .",
    "we notice , by the way , that similar oscillations are observed also in disordered models , such as the arbim considered above , at sufficiently low temperatures ( lower than the ones used for simulations in this paper ) . in @xcite it was shown that the algebraic behavior can be understood in terms of the scaling of the barriers which tend to pin the displacement of interfaces . in the following we briefly sketch the argument ( more details can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    fig .",
    "[ sierpinski2 ] illustrates pictorially the evolution of an interface which progressively spans a part of the structure .",
    "initially , the position of the domain wall is outside the figure , in the left corner .",
    "this means that all the spins are , say , down .",
    "as time goes on , the interface enters the graph by moving across the intermediate position @xmath156 indicated by a dotted green line ( this means that spins on the left of the green line have been reversed up ) .",
    "the index @xmath157 refers to the fact that the interface is currently spanning the @xmath157-th generation of the fractal network .",
    "when the spins of the whole generation @xmath157 have been reversed , the interface , depicted with two green continuous arches in the middle of the sructure , is located in the configuration @xmath158 on the four _ cutting bonds_. since the energy of a domain wall is @xmath159 times its length , it is clear that in @xmath158 the interface has a minimum energy @xmath160 ( notice that this quantity is independent of @xmath157 ) .",
    "let us assume that the highest energy @xmath161 of the system during the above process was reached in the ( generic ) configuration @xmath156 , so that a barrier of height @xmath162 has been crossed .",
    "now the interface must proceed again to the right in order to reverse all the spins of the next generation @xmath163 , thus reaching the position @xmath164 located on the other four _ cutting bonds _ , and indicated by the couple of continuous magenta arches on the upper and lower right corners of the structure ( all the spins in the figure at this stage have then been reversed ) .",
    "also this configuration has an energy equal to @xmath165",
    ". this configuration can be reached by sequentially reversing parts of generation @xmath157 of the structure ( e.g. by first reversing another triangle of generation @xmath157 , say the lower - right one in fig .",
    "[ sierpinski2 ] ) .",
    "this event is analogous to the one described before . in particular , the interface in the intermediate position @xmath166 , depicted with a dashed - magenta line on the right of the structure , is analogous to the previous one at @xmath156 ( dotted - green ) , except for the presence of an extra part which in the present example is indicated with a dashed - magenta arch in the middle of the left side . denoting with @xmath167 the maximum energy reached by the system in the reversal of the @xmath163 generation , one concludes that @xmath168 , where @xmath169 is the extra amount of energy due to the new part of interface ( the dotted - magenta arch in the middle of the left side in the figure )",
    ". then @xmath170 . rewriting @xmath171 in terms of the size @xmath172 of the @xmath157-th generation , using @xmath173",
    ", one has @xmath174 . from this relation ,",
    "dropping the index @xmath157 , one has @xmath175 . assuming an arrhenius time @xmath176 to overcome the barrier",
    ", we arrive at a algebraic growth law @xmath177 with , [ stimazeta ] at low temperatures .",
    "the argument has been developed for the particular sg structure but it is expected to hold more generally for any finitely ramified deterministic fractal network and also for disordered structures with @xmath10 , since the key ingredient is their _ weakness _ , namely the possibility to disconnect an arbitrary large part of the network by cutting a finite number of links . due to that , the energy barriers that trap the interfaces on the cutting bonds grow as slow as a logarithm of the size of the domains .",
    "a completely different situation is encountered when the ising model is defined on the sc . in this case ,",
    "due to the absence of cutting bonds , an argument similar to one presented above shows that the pinning energy of the interfaces grows faster - in an algebraic way - with the size of the ordered domains .",
    "details can be found in  @xcite .",
    "we have shown in sec .",
    "[ epslt1m2 ] that in the arbim the characteristic power - law behavior @xmath130 of the point w is observed not only at w but along the whole line with @xmath72 , the only effect of changing @xmath27 is possibly to change the exponent @xmath86 . our analogy suggests that the same behavior should be observed also in the gsgim .",
    "we have performed a set of simulations with a small value of @xmath179 ( @xmath180 ) and another for a much larger value of this parameter ( @xmath181 ) .",
    "for each choice of @xmath27 we have considered different values of the quenching temperature @xmath65 .",
    "the results of our simulations are shown in fig .",
    "[ gasm2 ] .    starting with the case with @xmath182 ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ gasm2 ] ) we see that , as expected , the growth of @xmath0 is similar to the one observed in the ising model on the sg ( namely the case with @xmath60 ) , namely a power - law decorated by periodic oscillations whose amplitude increases upon lowering @xmath183 .",
    "this behavior is also analogous to what observed in the arbim for @xmath72 ( except for the oscillations ) , where the network of bonds with @xmath112 is a percolation fractal for which the ising critical temperature vanishes as in the sg .",
    "for @xmath184 the situation is qualitatively similar , with the quantitative difference of a much slower growth , for a given temperature , with respect to the case with for @xmath185 .",
    "this is expected since the height of barriers is related to @xmath31 .",
    "however , comparing curves for @xmath184 and @xmath182 with a similar value of @xmath138 , one finds roughly similar exponents ( for instance for @xmath186 and @xmath187 one has @xmath188 and @xmath189 respectively , and for @xmath190 and @xmath191 one has @xmath192 and @xmath193 respectively ) .",
    "this shows that the growth - law depends at most weakly on the parameter @xmath138 .    in order to understand the origin of these behaviors",
    "we go back to the argument of sec .",
    "[ oldsg ] for the ising model on the sg .",
    "when the interface is in the configuration @xmath158 sketched with two continuous - green arches in the middle of the structure in fig .",
    "[ sierpinski2 ] , the lower - left triangle abc of fig .",
    "[ sierpinsky ] contains up spins and the rest of the structure is down ( and there are no spins in the voids ) .",
    "the next spin to be reversed is one of those marked with a bold - green circle .",
    "since these are equivalent , to be concrete let us chose it to be the one denoted by the letter p. the energy needed to flip it is easily computed to be _",
    "p=4j [ enpsg ] in the case of the gsgim the dynamics proceeds along the same lines . however , starting again with the interface in the configuration with two continuous - green arches , besides the spin marked with the green circle in fig .",
    "[ sierpinsky ] also those indicated by a heavy violet box can flip . computing the energetic barriers one can easily convince that one of the latter is the next spin to be reversed ( for which the energy barrier is lower ) .",
    "let us stipulate this to be the one denoted with the letter q. the energy cost turns out to be @xmath194 .",
    "after reversing q , spin p will be flipped , which requires an energy @xmath195 .",
    "the maximum energy required to arrive to flip p is then _",
    "p^gsgim=[enpgsgim ] at this point we are left back to the situation reached by the ising model on the sg described before , since the blocked spin p has been flipped , and we can repeat the argument developed before to arrive to the conclusion that also in this case barriers grow logarithmically with the size of the domains , which in turn implies a temperature - dependent power - law growth of @xmath0 .",
    "notice however that in the case of the gsgim the reversal of p has been _ facilitated _ by the intermediate flipping of q. this , as we will show below , lowers the energy of the pinning barriers ( still maintaining the logarithmic scaling with @xmath0 ) . in order to show this we must compare the energy scale to flip p in the gsgim eq .",
    "( [ enpgsgim ] ) to the one  ( [ enpsg ] ) of the ising model on the sg with a coupling constant @xmath196 ( namely , the one obtained from the gsgim by removing altogether the bonds in the voids of the sg ) .",
    "the latter turns out to be always higher for @xmath97 .",
    "then , we can conclude that the evolution is faster in the gsgim or , in other words , that the addition of the extra dashed - red bonds of fig .",
    "[ sierpinsky ] speeds up the dynamics . indeed , for instance , extracting the effective exponent for the case with @xmath197 we find @xmath198 , a much larger value than that found for the ising model on the sg with @xmath199 at the same temperature which is @xmath188 .    in",
    "order check the consistency of our conjectures we have performed a series of simulation analogous to those for the gsgim also for the gscim . in this case , since on the sc cutting bonds are absent and the ising model defined on it has @xmath11 , we expect to see a situation similar to that observed in the arbim away from the line of fixed points w , namely an asymptotic logarithmic law for the domains size . for the ising model defined on the sc , in fact",
    ", it was shown in  @xcite that this is indeed the case .",
    "for the gscim the results for @xmath0 are presented in fig .",
    "[ carm2 ] . from the inset of this figure",
    "one sees that on a double log plot the data clearly bend downwards for both the values of @xmath200 considered .",
    "this indicates that the growth of the domains size is lower than a power - law . in the main figure",
    "the same data for @xmath0 are plotted against @xmath88 , still in a double logarithmic scale . for",
    "a growth like @xmath201 in this kind of plot one should observe a straight line with slope @xmath202 .",
    "due to the oscillating character of the data one can not rich a clearcut evidence on the real form of @xmath0 . however , particularly for the higher values of temperatures considered , one can conclude that at least a logarithmic behavior describes much better the data with respect to a power - law .",
    "notice that , also in this case , curves with comparable values of @xmath138 behave quite similarly , suggesting that this combination of parameters only weekly affects the dynamics .      in summary",
    ", we have shown the following analogies between the arbim and the paradigmatic models based on deterministic fractal networks :    * \\i ) for @xmath22 , when the randomness of the coupling constant amounts to bond dilution , one finds a power - law growth of the ordered domains ( possibly with periodic oscillations ) in those cases with weak diluted networks .",
    "this means the arbim at the percolation threshold or the gsgim ( since the sg has @xmath10 ) . *",
    "\\ii ) one finds power - law growth also for @xmath97 in those cases where the network of the stronger bonds @xmath203 is weak , i.e. in the arbim on the green w line schematized in fig .",
    "[ phas_diag ] , or in the gsgim . *",
    "\\iii ) the growth - law slower than a power - law ( of a logarithmic type ) in all the other cases , namely when the network of bonds with @xmath112 is not weak .",
    "this corresponds to the region of parameter space of the arbim away from the green w - line of fig .",
    "[ phas_diag ] or , considering the fractal structures , in the gscim for any choice of the parameters .",
    "these observations can be rationalized as follows : the gsgim depends on the quantities @xmath30 , @xmath204 , whereas in the arbim the extra parameter @xmath25 is also present .",
    "the network of bonds @xmath108 of the gsgim , being a sg , is always weak .",
    "the dynamics of this model can then be understood considering that , in a sense , changing @xmath27 corresponds to drive the arbim along the green w - line . on the other hand",
    ", the gscim , which is based on a structure with no cutting bonds , corresponds to the arbim away from the line of fixed points w.",
    "this paper was devoted to the study of phase - ordering on inhomogeneous systems , focusing on the growth - law of the ordered domains .",
    "previous studies on systems with site dilution , either random  @xcite or deterministic  @xcite , suggest that the growth - law is strongly affected by the topological properties of the substrate , namely the network of non - diluted sites , similarly to what is known for equilibrium properties .",
    "specifically , it was shown that the growth - law is of a logarithmic type if the substrate is such that a finite - temperature phase - transition is present , whereas it turns to a to power - law on networks that do not support such phase - transition .",
    "this suggests that a similar correspondence could be at work also in systems whith different kinds of inhomogeneities .    in this paper",
    "we have studied this possibility by considering , as a first step , a system with bond dilution , a source of inhomogeneity different , but as close as possible , to that of site - diluted systems . besides addressing the problem of the influence of topology on the non - equilibrium processes , our study is also ment to possibly shed some light on the nature of the power - law like pre - asymptotic regime in ferromagnetic systems with a random bond distribution @xcite . in this perspective , we have undertaken a thorough investigation of the non - equilibrium evolution of a quenched random - bond ising model , the arbim , where two kind of bonds with strength @xmath124 occurring with relative probabilities @xmath25 , @xmath26 , are randomly seeded on a two - dimensional square - lattice .",
    "this allows us not only to study the case of bond dilution , corresponding to @xmath22 , but also the generic case which , as discussed above , is relevant to the physics of disordered ferromagnets .",
    "our study shows that the whole pattern of behaviors of the model as its parameters ( such as @xmath27 , the quench temperature , and @xmath25 ) are varied can be interpreted in terms either of logarithmic or power - law growth laws , and of crossover phenomena between them , similarly to what was found in models with site dilution  @xcite . for @xmath22 ,",
    "when the randomness of the bonds amounts to a dilution , this interplay can be interpreted in terms of the topology of the substrate .",
    "interestingly , this very interpretation provides a framework to the behavior of the system also for @xmath205 , where the form of bond randomness does not amount to simple dilution .    to check the generality of such an interpretation , and in order to study",
    "the phenomenon on simpler systems , we have also considered a ferromagnetic model defined on deterministic substrates , such as the sierpinski carpet and gasket , which do ( or do not , respectively ) support a finite - temperature phase - transition . according to the general conjecture put forth in  @xcite",
    ", these models should represent two paradigmatic examples of logarithmic and power - law growth , because these behaviors are not expected to depend on specific details of the system , but they only rely on the presence of a critical point .",
    "since these structures have the advantage to be deterministic , they can be regarded as toy systems where the properties observed in the more complex disordered cases , as in the arbim model , can be more carefully studied , checked and , possibly , understood . indeed , by defining an ising model with the same bimodal distribution of bonds as in the arbim , we were able to identify a similar pattern of behaviors to the one observed in the arbim .",
    "since the occurrence of preasymptotic power - laws followed by a logarithmic growth is observed also in systems with different kinds of quenched disorder as , for instance , random fields , it would be interesting to understand if a similar interpretation applies also in these cases . this would promote the conjecture put forth in this paper to a more general character .",
    "next to the behavior of @xmath0 , the role of disorder ( and more generally of any source of inhomogeneity ) is relevant for the form of the scaling functions of correlation and response functions  @xcite .",
    "in particular the so - called _ superuniversality _",
    "@xcite , namely the property according to which @xmath0 should depend on the strength of the disorder while the scaling functions should not , after some initial confirmations  @xcite has been recently questioned  @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "the results of this paper and their interpretation in terms of competition between different scaling behaviors strengthen previous findings against superuniversality .",
