    "observational evidences imply that the universe is undergoing a phase of anomalous acceleration after a precise time , usually named the _ transition time _ @xcite . in particular",
    ", the corresponding transition redshift , @xmath0 , indicates at which stage the universe changed its dynamical properties and started accelerating after a phase of deceleration @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been argued that constraining @xmath0 provides information on the form of the fluid responsible for the observed universe speeding up .",
    "consequently , @xmath0 may likely reveal possible new gravitational physics due to modifications of einstein s gravity @xcite .",
    "the fluid which triggers the current universe acceleration is often referred to as _ dark energy _ and fills more than the 70@xmath3 of the whole universe energy budget @xcite .",
    "the standard cosmological model assumes that the dark energy source is supplied by the existence of a non - zero cosmological constant @xmath2 .",
    "the corresponding paradigm , named the @xmath2cdm model , is constructed by employing a net matter density composed by baryons and cold dark matter , with a constant dark energy term @xmath4 @xcite . even though the model likely represents the simplest approach for describing universe s dynamics , amongst others the cosmological constant",
    "does not furnish an explanation to the _ coincidence problem _ between matter and dark energy magnitudes .",
    "in other words , since the cosmological constant does not evolve in time , it is improbable that the ratio between matter and dark energy densities is so close today @xcite",
    ". additionally , quantum field theory predictions forecast an enormous value for the cosmological constant if compared with the one measured by current cosmological observations .",
    "this issue is the well known _",
    "fine - tuning _ problem and represents a challenge to understand the physical origin of the cosmological constant itself @xcite . due to the above caveats",
    ", one can modify the universe content , and attribute the dark energy sector to a canonical scalar field , a phantom field , to the combination of both fields in a unified model , or proceed to more complicated constructions ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative way to reproduce the universe dynamics is by extensions of general relativity by means of additional degrees of freedom , which do not violate the equivalence principle , and represent a bid to formulate a semi - classical scheme for both late and early - time universe @xcite . in the usual approach to modify gravity , one starts by the usual curvature formulation of general relativity , and replaces the ricci scalar @xmath5 in the einstein - hilbert action by arbitrary functions of it , or even more complicated curvature invariants .",
    "however , alternatively one can use as a base the torsional formulation of general relativity , namely the so called `` teleparallel equivalent of general relativity '' @xcite , and modify its action instead . in particular , in teleparallel gravity @xcite the gravitational field is described not by the curvature tensor but by the torsion one , and thus the corresponding lagrangian , namely the torsion scalar @xmath6 , is constructed by contraction of the torsion tensor in a similar way that in usual general relativity the lagrangian , namely the curvature scalar @xmath5 , is constructed by contractions of the curvature tensor .",
    "hence , similarly to the @xmath7 extension of general relativity , one can construct the @xmath1 extension of teleparallel equivalent of general relativity @xcite .",
    "the interesting feature is that although general relativity coincides completely with teleparallel equivalent of general relativity , @xmath1 gravity is different from @xmath7 one , thus it is a novel gravitational modification with rich cosmological implications @xcite .    with those considerations in mind , in this work we are interested in describing the dark energy effects , directly calculating the corresponding transition redshift @xmath0 that is predicted in @xmath1 cosmology . in order to do so",
    ", we only consider those @xmath1 models which are consistent with present - time cosmographic constraints .",
    "hence , we aim to obtain cosmographic bounds on the @xmath1 scenarios , by considering the modified friedmann equations , and then get the corresponding limits on @xmath0 .",
    "the main advantage of using cosmography is that the value of @xmath0 is reconstructed by means of a model - independent procedure .",
    "rephrasing it differently , we are able to distinguish which classes of @xmath1 gravity pass the cosmographic requirements and thus are viable , by inferring the limits over @xmath0 that those classes predict . in particular , we compare this transition epoch with the one determined by the standard cosmological paradigm , and we propose an effective cosmological model capable of reproducing the cosmographic constraints and compatible with the limits on @xmath0 . additionally , to enable our treatment , we consider the use of the luminosity distance and we match cosmic union 2.1 supernova data @xcite with the cosmographic expansions .",
    "thus , we evaluate the corresponding deceleration parameter and we show that the transition redshift is effectively comparable to the one predicted by the @xmath2cdm approach .",
    "as we will see , the limits on @xmath0 show that the considered @xmath1 classes reduce to the @xmath2cdm model in the lowest redshift domain , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "this feature indicates that the role played by the cosmological constant may be reinterpreted as a limiting case of a more general extension , and thus from those cosmographic corrections we show that small discrepancies occur at @xmath8 , whereas higher departures might be expected at high - redshift regimes . at this point",
    ", we involve a monte carlo fitting procedure based on the metropolis algorithm , in order to compare our effective cosmological model with present - time data .",
    "numerical limits , priors and final outcomes , testify the efficiency of our approach , showing that the effective torsional dark energy naturally satisfies the cosmographic requirements , and hence it may be a candidate as a valid alternative to describe the universe dynamics .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sectionii ] we describe the techniques for recovering the cosmographic settings on the @xmath1 classes of models and we moreover propose how to obtain @xmath1 reconstructions . in sec .",
    "[ sectioniii ] we enumerate the properties of the transition redshift and its important role in modern cosmology .",
    "furthermore , we describe the main consequences in @xmath1 gravity and we show how the modified friedmann equations changed when the transition occurred . in sec .",
    "[ sectioniv ] we summarize the cosmographic results and we propose an effective reconstruction of @xmath1 cosmology . to do so",
    ", we infer the deceleration parameter for the effective torsional dark energy models and finally we show the numerical priors on the transition redshift @xmath0 predicted by our paradigm . in sec .",
    "[ sectionv ] we compare the cosmological consequences of the examined models with modern data , employing the use of the union 2.1 supernova survey .",
    "we determine the free parameters of our approach and we show that the dark energy corrections are compatible with the bounds offered by alternative dark energy models . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sectionvi ] we summarize the conclusions and perspectives of our approach .",
    "in teleparallel formulation of gravity , as well as in its @xmath1 extension , one uses the vierbein fields @xmath9 , which form an orthonormal base for the tangent space at each point @xmath10 defined on a generic manifold , and thus the metric reads as @xmath11 ( in the following greek indices and latin indices span the coordinate and tangent spaces respectively ) . additionally , instead of the torsionless levi - civita connection one uses the curvatureless weitzenbck one @xmath12 @xcite , and therefore the gravitational field is encoded in the torsion tensor @xmath13 hence , the lagrangian of teleparallel gravity , namely the torsion scalar @xmath6 , is constructed by contractions of the torsion tensor as @xcite @xmath14 finally , one can extend teleparallel gravity and construct the action of @xmath1 gravity as @xcite @xmath15 , \\label{actionft}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the general field equations of @xmath1 gravity are obtained by varying the action @xmath18 , with @xmath19 the matter action , in terms of the vierbeins , and they read as @xmath20 where the tensor @xmath21 is defined in terms of the co - torsion @xmath22 , and where @xmath23 is the energy - momentum tensor corresponding to @xmath19 . in ( [ eq : ixa-2.7 ] )",
    "the primes denote derivatives with respect to @xmath6 .",
    "finally , since for @xmath24 equations ( [ eq : ixa-2.7 ] ) provide exactly the same equations with general relativity , that is why the theory with @xmath24 was named by einstein `` teleparallel equivalent of general relativity '' @xcite .    in order to apply @xmath1 gravity in a cosmological framework",
    "we assume a spatially - flat friedmann - robertson - walker metric @xmath25 , with @xmath26 , which can arise from the vierbein @xmath27 . in this case , the field equations ( [ eq : ixa-2.7 ] ) give rise to the modified friedmann equation    @xmath28    with @xmath29 the hubble parameter and dots indicating derivatives with respect to the cosmic time . in the above expressions",
    "@xmath30 and @xmath31 are the energy density and pressure of the matter sector considered to correspond to a perfect fluid , and moreover from now on we use units in which @xmath32 . furthermore , we have introduced the energy density and pressure of the effective dark energy sector , which incorporates the torsional modifications , as    @xmath33 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus , the dark energy equation - of - state parameter writes as @xmath34 .",
    "finally , note that for the frw geometry , the calculation of the torsion scalar ( [ tscalar ] ) leads to the useful relation @xmath35    the issue of finding out a form for the dark energy equation of state passes through the determination of the most viable forms of @xmath1 .",
    "if one knows the @xmath1 form , it is possible to infer the interpretations of @xmath36 and @xmath37 as terms associated to torsional dark energy , i.e. a torsional contribution driving the observed cosmic acceleration .",
    "the idea to get a viable @xmath1 function lies on requiring that at small redshift the @xmath1 model reproduces the observational data and predicts a compatible transition redshift .",
    "hence , the strategy of this manuscript is to frame a phenomenological reconstruction of @xmath1 and its derivatives in terms of cosmography , which becomes a sort of initial settings for @xmath1 models .",
    "having in mind these cosmographic requirements , we simply impose the validity of the cosmological principle @xcite , the geometrical setting of the scalar curvature @xcite , and the possibility of expanding @xmath1 and its derivatives around present time in taylor series @xcite .",
    "we discuss below each of those three requirements , in order to define the cosmographic series and its application in @xmath1 cosmology .    * first , employing the cosmological principle permits to frame the universe expansion history in terms of a single parameter , namely the scale factor @xmath38 which enters the friedmann - robertson - walker metric as function of the cosmic time only .",
    "one gathers viable outcomes imposing that this function may be expanded in taylor series around present time , and constraining the corresponding taylor coefficients associated to the scale - factor derivatives .",
    "this strategy compares @xmath38 s derivatives _ directly _ with cosmic data and may be used as a reconstruction for the @xmath38 shape .",
    "this benefit allows one to distinguish among all paradigms , derived from imposing the form of @xmath1 , the ones whose cosmographic requirements better match with data . *",
    "the second caveat is the issue of spatial curvature which leads to a degeneracy problem between its value and the variation of the acceleration .",
    "it has been proved that photon geodesics change their paths according to its value .",
    "thus , expanding a physical quantity into a cosmographic series needs to fix somehow the value of spatial curvature , in order to allow cosmography to be as model - independent as possible @xcite . according to previous approaches @xcite ,",
    "one imposes geometrical bounds on @xmath39 by assuming the matching between early and late time observations @xcite .",
    "we therefore assume that the universe is spatially flat , with possible small deviations which do not influence the whole dynamics . * finally , since all observable quantities of interest are assumed to smoothly evolve as the universe expands , it is licit to assume that taylor expansions may be easily accounted and no saddle points or poles occur .",
    "it follows that all functions are analytic and the cosmographic treatment is perfectly plausible @xcite . after those properties , one soon expands in taylor series the scale factor @xmath38 as @xmath40 where @xmath41 , with @xmath42 and @xmath43 the present time .",
    "finally , it proves convenient to express the observable quantities under interest in terms of the redshift @xmath44 .    amongst all observables",
    ", we are much interested in the use of the luminosity distance , since we will use supernovae ia type to fix our cosmological bounds .",
    "hence , imposing @xmath45 in and inserting it in the definition of the luminosity distance : @xmath46 we write down the taylor series around @xmath47 as @xmath48 truncated at the third order .",
    "moreover , applying also the definitions    [ hpunto ] @xmath49    we obtain the corresponding coefficients of the taylor expansion in terms of the cosmographic series :    [ coefficienti ] @xmath50    in these expressions we have introduced the deceleration and jerk parameters as    [ csdef ] @xmath51    indicating respectively whether the universe is accelerating or not and how the acceleration changed sign , with the subscript `` 0 '' denoting the value of a quantity at present .",
    "observations indicate @xmath52 and then testify that the transition time occurred .",
    "however , there still exists a tension between the possibilities @xmath53 and @xmath54 @xcite .    for the sake of completeness",
    ", we notice that it would be easy to arbitrarily extend the cosmographic series up to higher orders .",
    "for example , the next term , entering the taylor expansion of the luminosity distance , i.e. the fourth order , would linearly depend on the snap @xmath55 evaluated at present time - term @xcite . ] .",
    "however , expanding beyond the third - order leads to a non - clear physical interpretation of the corresponding coefficients .",
    "in other words , using extended cosmographic series at higher order could become quite non - predictive for our analysis , since it is difficult to physically bound coefficients beyond @xmath56 .",
    "indeed , in order to improve constraints over cosmographic coefficients at arbitrary orders , one can imagine to adopt either experimental combined tests or different definitions of cosmic distances @xcite . in particular , using combined tests may generally reduce the numerical intervals of cosmographic coefficients , while any alternative distance definition would be plagued by inaccurate under / over - estimations of the cosmographic parameters , typically due to the limited cosmic available data .",
    "in addition , present time combined tests may only provide tighter ellipses where the cosmographic coefficients span , albeit definitive constraints up to @xmath57 confidence level would be hardly determined .",
    "a straightforward example of the difficulty to bound the cosmographic parameters is offered by supposing to fix the today spatial curvature with arbitrary accuracy . in that case",
    ", it would be possible to better circumscribe the parameters beyond the third order ( including jerk , snap , or higher terms ) gravity . ] .",
    "unfortunately , from this procedure we can only partially exclude regions where those intervals run , getting corresponding upper and lower limits which characterize each coefficients of the taylor expansions confidence level . ] .",
    "recent analysis fixes the following limits over the cosmographic coefficients @xcite :    [ regioni ] @xmath58\\,,\\\\ j_0&\\in[0.8;\\,2]\\,,\\\\ s_0&\\in[-1;\\,7]\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    all evaluated at a @xmath59 confidence level .",
    "it is immediately clear that badly constrained results can be obtained going beyond the third order of the cosmographic expansion .",
    "in particular , as stressed above , the issue associated to those regions is that they correspond to narrow ( and often long ) ellipses which are characterized by high error dispersions .",
    "thus , even modern data seem to focus on strict regions for @xmath60 and @xmath56 , whereas do not account for the sign of @xmath61 in the same way .",
    "in addition , as shown in @xcite , one may relate cosmography to the cosmic equation of state .",
    "from this fact , it is easy to show that the second order derivative of the cosmic pressure with respect to the total density linearly depends upon @xmath61 itself . alternatively ,",
    "even the second derivative of the acceleration parameter , i.e. @xmath62 , can not be accurately constrained with current numerics on @xmath61 reported in .    summarizing , adopting present data , all cosmographic quantities suffer from badly bounded numerical results , so that the use of @xmath61 in our approach would influence the experimental analysis itself , providing broadening systematics and higher dispersions in the evaluations of the transition redshift @xmath63 . for those reasons",
    ", in order to consider fourth order expansions , one should adopt improved intervals of cosmic data or using distance definitions that do not somehow depend on scalar curvature , i.e. where the scalar curvature is not fixed as a prior coming from other observations .",
    "hence , in this paper , we definitively use a truncated third order taylor expansions of @xmath64 thanks to the above considerations .",
    "in so doing , the numerical results of @xmath60 and @xmath56 lead to acceptable dispersions and allow us to better circumscribe the intervals for @xmath0 in a more suitable way .    thus , from the above analysis it follows that the cosmographic series is the set of coefficients evaluated at present time .",
    "the cosmographic series has been built up in function of a taylor series expanded around @xmath47 , albeit it is possible to handle it also in terms of the cosmic time .",
    "this is clearly possible involving the definition of the redshift in terms of the cosmic time as : @xmath65    since the cosmographic series may be expressed in terms of the scale - factor derivatives , it does not depend upon the particular choice of the cosmological model .",
    "this property represents a key to conclude that imposing a cosmological model _ a priori _ is unnecessary and any modified gravity may be limited by assuming the cosmographic requirements .",
    "we here follow the technique of reconstructing the @xmath1 models by means of late - time cosmography .",
    "to do so , we rewrite the luminosity distance in terms of @xmath1 derivatives .",
    "this is possible since there exists a direct correspondence between @xmath66 and @xmath56 with the @xmath1 form and its derivatives . in particular , rewriting as function of @xmath1 , we frame the effective model derived from the torsional dark energy by directly comparing @xmath64 with data .",
    "rephrasing it differently , instead of using @xmath67 we consider @xmath68 and we obtain the numerical outcomes on those quantities . the cosmographic constraints on @xmath1 and its derivatives , point out the numerical priors that we use as _ initial settings _ for reconstructing the shape of viable effective @xmath1 models , which reproduce dark energy at small redshift .",
    "afterwards , we predict the transition redshift from our effective model and we understand whether our model indicates a viable @xmath0 if compared with the @xmath2cdm predictions .",
    "we will report the connections between the cosmographic series and the @xmath1 derivatives in sec .",
    "in the scenario at hand , the @xmath1 term drives the dark energy contribution , interpreting the dark sector as due to a _ torsional dark energy_.",
    "it is widely believed that the dark energy contribution dominates over matter at our time , while it appears negligible at higher redshift regimes .",
    "the type of the transition and the time at which it occurs are extremely relevant , since they indicate the dark energy nature and may also provide information on how the dark energy evolves in time . in particular , the transition time and correspondingly the transition redshift emphasize the change from decelerated to accelerated cosmological expansion , and represent a prediction of any particular model involved to describe the universe expansion history . in other words , direct measurements of the transition redshift provide direct information on both the deceleration and acceleration epochs .",
    "to show how to investigate @xmath0 in the framework of @xmath1 gravity , let us consider the definition of the transition redshift , which occurs at a zero of the deceleration parameter @xmath69 .",
    "we will find out the transition redshift @xmath0 for a class of cosmographic @xmath1 models , and we will also compare it with standard model predictions and with recent bounds on @xmath0 itself .    passing through the phase of transition between matter and dark energy dominance , and assuming the matter to be dust ( i.e. @xmath70 ) , it is useful to combine the two friedmann equations ( [ equazionidifriedmann1 ] ) , ( [ equazionidifriedmann2 ] ) to obtain the torsional pressure in terms of the deceleration parameter as : @xmath71 where we made use of relation . at the transition time",
    "we therefore obtain the value of the torsional pressure as @xmath72 which corresponds to @xmath73 at the transition redshift @xmath0 , with hubble rate @xmath74 .",
    "this expression is equivalent to the standard barotropic dark - energy pressure in the framework of general relativity given by @xcite : @xmath75 in particular , the two results , and , lead to the same formal outcome .",
    "in fact , assuming @xmath74 to be positive definite , both the torsional and standard dark - energy pressures are negative at the transition . however , the physical meaning behind and is different , in the sense that in the first case the transition is induced by the torsional terms , while in the standard approach the transition is realized due to the dark energy or curvature terms .    in the standard @xmath2cdm cosmological model , the cosmological",
    "constant contributes about 70@xmath3 of the present cosmological energy budget and the consequence on cosmology lies on an evolving deceleration parameter @xmath69 of the form @xcite @xmath76}\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath77 the present matter density parameter , and where the corresponding transition redshift formally is given by @xmath78 which has been obtained assuming @xmath79 .",
    "thus , the @xmath2cdm model gives an exact solution for @xmath0 , of the form @xmath80^{1/3}-1\\,.\\ ] ]    in the following section we will use relations and in order to infer the numerical values of the torsional pressure at the transition time .",
    "afterwards , we will quantify the difference of the standard predictions of the @xmath2cdm model with those obtained in the present cosmographic approach .",
    "we will therefore predict @xmath0 for @xmath1 cosmology and we will compare it with expression .",
    "let us now apply the approach described in the previous two sections and proceed to the reconstruction of effective cosmographic @xmath1 models .",
    "we start by using ( [ torsioneehubble ] ) , as well as , , in order to calculate the time derivatives of @xmath6 as    [ cosmoto ] @xmath81    with the connection between the torsion and @xmath82 reading as @xmath83 hence , at the transition time , we have @xmath84 the cosmographic requirements give the connection between @xmath85 and @xmath86 from the modified friedmann equations , namely @xcite    [ normali ] @xmath87\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and moreover @xmath88 to guarantee the solar - system constraints in order to preserve the value of @xmath89 at our time @xcite .    thus , using expressions and",

    "the last condition has been imposed assuming that the universe is slightly evolving in the redshift domain @xmath8 .",
    "we stress that the priors ( [ no ] ) are the requirements that determine whether a specific @xmath1 form is viable or not .",
    "the strategy is the following : we assume the validity of the cosmographic series as the initial conditions of the modified friedmann equations , and then we integrate the first friedmann equation .",
    "thus , we infer the numerical values of @xmath97 for different redshifts , and we separately extrapolate those points , determining a list of numbers for @xmath97 and @xmath98 . finally , through the use of testing functions , we reconstruct an effective @xmath1 which reproduces the numerical limits . hence , from this function one obtains a parameterized cosmological model , which departs from the @xmath2cdm scenario , corresponding to a varying dark - energy sector .",

    "the parameter @xmath104 is fixed in order to guarantee that at @xmath47 the hubble rate is identically @xmath105 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath106 hence , the cosmographic reconstruction of torsional dark energy provides a deceleration parameter of the form    in fig .",
    "[ figura2 ] we depict the behaviors of @xmath107 and @xmath108 , given in and respectively .",
    "we deduce that up to the redshift domain @xmath109 , our approach is compatible with the standard cosmological model , and in fact only small differences occur between our predictions and the @xmath2cdm ones , which are slightly larger .",
    "this is due to the fact that our @xmath97 parameter indicates a dark - energy evolution which does not departure significantly from the case of a constant dark - energy term at small redshifts .",

    "this permits one to determine @xmath0 from expression .",
    "in the next section we describe the fitting procedure using supernova data , and we extract numerical bounds on the free parameters of our cosmographic torsional dark - energy scenario .",
    "the above approach provided a particular set of cosmographic quantities related to the @xmath1 form .",
    "correspondingly , the effective hubble rate was built in terms of corrections to the simple teleparallel gravity , that is to general relativity .",
    "hence , these corrections are due to the difference between @xmath1 cosmology and the standard paradigm of @xmath2cdm cosmology .",
    "these terms may be compared with the cosmological constant value without showing great departures at small redshift regimes , as we discussed in the above section .",
    "the contribution due to the @xmath1 sector needs to match an adequate convergence at small and high redshift domains .",

    "this survey is built up by 580 measurements of apparent magnitudes , with the corresponding redshifts and magnitude errors . assuming a gaussian distribution , one acquires the relevant fact that the luminosity distance may be rewritten in terms of the cosmographic series itself .",
    "thus , all observations may be performed by directly fitting @xmath64 with union 2.1 data .",

    "our analyses are based on two statistical treatments , characterized by different maximum order of parameters .",
    "we perform such a procedure in order to provide a hierarchy among all parameters .",
    "firstly , we allow all parameters to freely vary ( fit1 ) , and secondly we fix the mass density parameter through values compatible with the most recent planck measurements @xcite ( fit2 ) .",
    "our numerical results are summarized in table [ tabella ] , where we separately report the obtained and the inferred results , showing the limits on the transition redshift itself .",

    "in fact , the mass density is overestimated probably due to the strong multiplicative degeneracy between the coefficients @xmath77 and @xmath115 , as one can see from .",
    "the cosmographic analysis suffers from this kind of degeneracy and shows the same inefficiency in bounding @xmath0 , which seems to significantly departure from the @xmath2cdm predictions , as shown by looking at the @xmath158 .",
    "the likelihood contours of this case are shown in fig .",

    "this fixing enables to get refined limits even on the other two free coefficients of our model , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ figura1b ] ( compare with the middle graph of fig . [ figura1a ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "we obtain more precise bounds on @xmath0 , which becomes perfectly compatible with the constraints predicted by the @xmath2cdm model , at the @xmath160 confidence level .",
    "our value however seems to be slightly smaller than theoretical expectations ( @xmath161 according to @xcite ) .     and",

    "further , this seems to be evident by looking at the contour plots of figs .",
    "[ figura1a ] and [ figura1b ] , in which a delineated curve corresponds to the second fit . in other words , from these figures it is clear that the first fit shows higher errors since the contours are larger than the one inferred from the second fit .",
    "nevertheless , in all cases the predicted transition time occurs at @xmath162 , in agreement with the standard theoretical framework .",
    "in this paper we investigated the transition redshift derived in an effective model inferred from @xmath1 gravity . in order to do so ,",
    "we extracted an approximate reconstruction of the @xmath1 dark - energy term . the effective dark energy contribution has been obtained by numerically solving the friedmann equations , employing as initial conditions the numerical outcomes obtained from cosmographic bounds . in this way , we defined a set of numerical constraints on @xmath1 and its derivatives in a model - independent way , and we were able to fix the evolving dark - energy term through a logarithmic correction .",
    "our cosmographic model well adapts to the late - time constraints , and it reproduces a cosmological model which smoothly departures from the standard @xmath2cdm paradigm . the corresponding limits on the free parameters of the model have been obtained by directly fitting the luminosity distance with supernova data , using the most recent union 2.1 compilation .",
    "we extracted viable constraints on the free parameters of the scenario , in two distinct fits with different hierarchy between coefficients .",
    "we first considered all parameters free to vary and afterwards we fixed the value of the matter density consistently with current planck results .",
    "all predictions provided intervals for the transition redshift which are compatible with present expectations , although the numerical outcomes are slightly smaller than the ones predicted by the standard cosmological model .",
    "departures have been encountered in the case where we leave all parameters free to vary , due to the degeneracy problem between coefficients in the luminosity distance definition .",
    "possible approaches will be devoted to better fix those constraints by means of combined cosmological tests .",
    "moreover , we could mostly investigate the properties of our logarithmic corrections , studying their consequences in the early phases of the universe evolution .",
    "finally , it would be interesting to extend the above analysis in the case of higher - order torsional cosmology , and in particular in the case where the teleparallel equivalent of the gauss - bonnet combination is used in the action , as in @xmath163 cosmology @xcite .",
    "the corresponding results could be compared with both @xmath2cdm cosmology , as well as with the @xmath164 cosmology @xcite .",
    "such an analysis could provide more information on the possible distinguishability of curvature and torsional gravity using cosmographic methods .",
