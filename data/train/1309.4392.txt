    "since the foundation of quantum mechanics , a huge amount of data on energy levels , linewidths and other properties of atoms have been recorded . very often , such compilations are still waiting for a qualitative analysis , based on simple models .    in recent articles",
    "@xcite , on the basis of the scaling suggested by thomas - fermi theory @xcite , we have demonstrated universality in the ionization potentials and the correlation energies of atomic ions .    in the present paper , we construct an analytical expression for the ionization energy of atomic ions , which is to be used in order to detect problematic values @xcite in the numbers provided by the nist database.@xcite    our expression is a regularized perturbative series ( rps ) , previously employed in other contexts @xcite .",
    "we use perturbation theory in @xmath8 @xcite in order to compute the first two coefficients of the energy series in the large-@xmath1 region .",
    "additionaly , we require our rps to reproduce the value of the ionization potential at @xmath6 ( i.e. the electron affinity ) and the slope of the curve at this point . the latter is computed from a kind of zero - range forces theory that uses as input the electron affinity and the covalent radius of the neutral atom with @xmath7 electrons .",
    "@xcite the rps continuosly interpolates between the @xmath9 and large-@xmath1 limits for a given isoelectronic sequence .",
    "hereunder , we provide the main formulae entering the rps expression .",
    "a few isoelectronic sequences are studied in quality of examples . a systematic analysis of the nist database is contained in refs . .",
    "it is well known that , for large @xmath1 , the attraction of the electrons by the nucleus is stronger than electron - electron repulsion . on the contrary , for the neutral atom",
    "both contributions are more or less balanced , and in the anionic domain this balance may even be broken at a given @xmath4 , where the atom spontaneously autoionizes .    first - principle calculations @xcite and some extrapolations @xcite indicate that @xmath5 is indeed very close to @xmath7 , excluding the possibility of doubly charged negative ions .",
    "a recent result by gridnev,@xcite on the other hand , rigorously states that the wave function is normalized at threshold .",
    "if we combine this result with perturbation theory , we get that the binding energy exhibits a linear dependence on @xmath1 near @xmath5 .    in a previous paper,@xcite",
    "we compute the slope of the curve not at @xmath5 , but at @xmath6 . at this value of @xmath1",
    "the outermost electron weakly interacts with the neutral core and the interaction is short - ranged .",
    "it can be shown that conditions are fulfilled for the application of zero - range forces theory .",

    "atomic ions become unstable for large @xmath1 , showing a threshold for electron - positron pair production at @xmath14.@xcite performing the scaling @xmath15 in the non - relativistic hamiltonian , we get :    @xmath16    notice that the expression inside brackets has a one - particle contribution ( kinetic energy plus nuclear attraction ) and the two - particle repulsion between electrons .",
    "the latter is of order @xmath17 . at large values of @xmath1",
    ", the atom can be described as a system of non - interacting electrons in the central coulomb field of the nucleus .",
    "the energy in this leading approximation is :    @xmath18    next , we shall include electron repulsions in first order perturbation theory .",
    "the energy is written as :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the slater determinant made of hydrogenic functions .",
    "corrections are explicitly given by :    @xmath21    note that the sums runs over the occupied orbitals @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the slater determinant , and that @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote , respectively , direct and exchange two - electron coulomb integrals involving orbitals @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",

    "we claim that , in spite of the fact that our relativistic rps does not have spectroscopic precision , abrupt changes in the difference nist - rps may be a sign of inconsistency .",
    "indeed , abrupt changes in @xmath72 are related to rearrangements of the electronic spectrum . in the interval between rearrangements or for large enough @xmath1 ,",

    "[ fig1 ] , the @xmath73 point is so far from the average curve , for example , that it should be corrected .",
