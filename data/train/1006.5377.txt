    "dark energy @xcite is introduced to explain the expanding of our universe .",
    "we still have very little knowledge about it .",
    "one of the more interested candidate is cosmological constant with the equation of state parameter @xmath0 .",
    "but the physical interpretation of the vacuum energy density is still faultiness . and",
    "the problem that why the dark energy and dark matter are at the same order today is still unknown , this is so - called coincidence problem . to overcome this problem , many dynamical dark energy models have been introduced to replace the cosmological constant .",
    "but there are still many other approaches to explain the coincidence problem .",
    "an interesting proposal is that the dark energy is interacting with dark matter .",
    "many interacting models have been studied .",
    "the interacting term always is the function of the hubble parameter @xmath1 , the density of dark energy @xmath2 and the density of the dark matter @xmath3 ( for example , please see the second section of @xcite and the references of it ) , or the function of @xmath4 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "a general interaction between dark energy and dark matter is described by @xmath5 in which @xmath6 is the equation of state parameter of dark energy .",
    "a constant @xmath6 and @xmath0 crossing were studied by many authors @xcite . in this paper",
    "we just consider @xmath6 is a negative constant .",
    "@xmath7 is the interacting term . and",
    "we will discuss two models : @xmath8 in which @xmath9 are some constants .",
    "model i has been discussed by @xcite in einstein cosmology ( ec ) , they considered that @xmath10 .",
    "but more special cases also have been studied , e.g. , @xmath11 @xcite , @xmath12 @xcite , @xmath13 @xcite , in ec . for more simplicity",
    ", we will discuss @xmath14 for the first model .",
    "the second model also has been discussed in ec @xcite , @xmath15 is constant , and we will discuss @xmath16 .",
    "we will introduce three dimensionless variables to study those models in loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) , and discuss the difference and the common properties for dynamical system between lqc and in ec .",
    "lqc @xcite is a canonical quantization of homogeneous spactimes based upon techniques used in loop quantum gravity . due to the homogeneous and isotropic spacetime ,",
    "the phase space of lqc is simplifier then loop quantum gravity , e.g. , the connection is determined by a single parameter called @xmath17 and the triad is determined by @xmath18 .",
    "the variables @xmath17 and @xmath18 are canonically conjugate with poisson bracket @xmath19 , in which @xmath20 is the barbero - immirzi parameter . in lqc scenario ,",
    "the initial singularity is instead of a bounce .",
    "so thanks for the quantum effect , the universe is initially contracting phase with the minimal but not zero volume , and then the quantum effect drives it to the expanding phase . in the effecitve scenario ,",
    "the behavior of lqc also can be well described , e.g. , the big crunch instead of the big bounce @xcite .",
    "people always consider two kinds of correction of effective lqc , one is inverse volume correction , the other one is holonomy correction . in this paper , we just discuss the holonomy correction . in this effective lqc ,",
    "the friedmann equation is modified ( see eqs.([fri ] ) ) .",
    "it is easy to get the difference between the friedmann equation in ec and the one in lqc : it adds a @xmath21 term to standard friedmann equation which essentially encodes the discrete quantum geometric nature of spacetime @xcite .",
    "this means that the energy density will have a critical value , when the energy density is very nearly the critical density @xmath22 , the cosmology will have a bounce and then oscillates forever .",
    "due to the modification of the friedmann equation , the dynamical behaviors of dark energy and dark matter are very different from the ones in ec .",
    "this factor was showed by many authors , for example , the phantom field @xcite , the quintom field @xcite , the interacting phantom field @xcite , the interacting dark energy with the interacting term @xmath23 @xcite , and the dark energy interacting with cold dark matter without coupling to the baryonic matter@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will discuss the dynamical behavior of interacting dark energy .",
    "this paper is organized as following . in sec .",
    "[ sec.2 ] , we will review the dynamical behavior for interacting dark energy in ec . and",

    "the numerical analysis will be showed in the sec .",
    "[ sec.4 ] .",
    "and we get some conclusions in the last sec .",
    "[ sec.5 ] . for simplicity ,",
    "we set @xmath24 .",
    "in ec , the friedmann equation can be written as @xmath25 in which @xmath26 is the total energy density . differentiating eq.([hc ] ) and using the conversation law of the total energy density @xmath27",
    ", we can get @xmath28 in which @xmath29 is the pressure of dark energy ( the pressure of dark matter is zero ) , and @xmath30 , with the equation of state parameter @xmath6 .",
    "we just consider @xmath6 is a negative constant , then it is another parameter . to discuss the dynamical behavior of interacting dark energy in ec",
    ", we introduce the dimensionless variables @xcite : @xmath31 although the density of dark energy can be a negative on in the f(r ) theory @xcite , we restrict that the density of dark energy and dark matter both should be positive or one of then is zero .",
    "so both of @xmath32 and @xmath33 should be non - negative .",
    "the friedmann equation ( [ hc ] ) and eq.([dhc ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath34 the effective total equation of state parameter @xmath35 is @xmath36    in ec , the dynamical behavior of dimensionless variable @xmath37 are @xmath38 in which prime denotes the derivative with respect to the e - folding number @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) . just as @xcite argued , if @xmath41 , the above equations are closed and autonomous .",
    "the model i ( [ model i ] ) and ii ( [ model ii ] ) both are in this case .    for a autonomous system @xmath42 ,",
    "the fixed points @xmath43 satisfy @xmath44 .",
    "so , setting @xmath45 of eqs.([x],[y  ] ) and simplifying them , it is easy to get the fixed points satisfy :    [ ca ] @xmath46    in which @xmath47 is the value of @xmath48 in the fixed points . if @xmath49 , the second subequation of eq.([ca ] ) implies that @xmath50 .",

    "those models have been studied in ec by many authors @xcite .",
    "but for convenience to compare the dynamical behavior of interacting dark energy in lqc and the ones in ec , we review the dynamical behaviors of dark energy with different interacting term in ec in the next two subsections .      this interacting term has been discussed in many papers @xcite . in this subsection , for more simplicity , we just consider @xmath14 , the dimensionless interacting term is @xmath57 .",
    "eq.([ca ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath58 it is easy to get the fixed points @xmath59 from eq.([1ca ] ) : @xmath60    in order to determine the stability properties of the fixed points , it is necessary to expand the autonomous system @xmath42 around the fixed points @xmath43 , setting @xmath61 with @xmath62 the perturbations of the variables considered as a column vector .",

    "notice that the quantum effect should be considered just when @xmath147 is comparable to @xmath22 .",
    "so @xmath144 means that our universe is described by general relativity very well when the dynamical system arrives its fixed point .",
    "the energy density is very far from the one should consider the quantum effect .",
    "it is easy to check that all fixed points of the interacting models discussed in @xcite are determined by the condition of case i. case ii is just held in lqc , but we can get this case from the conversation equation for energy density @xmath148.\\label{bt}\\ ] ] when @xmath149 , this implies @xmath150 and @xmath151 . although the conversation for energy density should be satisfied both in ec and lqc , @xmath152 means that @xmath153 in classical universe , but considering eqs.([x],[y  ] ) and setting @xmath151 , this is nothing but @xmath144 .",

    "when the universe is quantum effect dominated , @xmath144 will not be satisfied , so , case ii is a special condition in lqc . considering eq.([case ii ] ) , we can find that the fixed points are described by this case is happening when @xmath154 with @xmath155 .",
    "notice that , @xmath125 should be satisfied in this case for @xmath156 .",
    "those fixed points which are determined by case ii are staying in the quantum regions , and if they are stable points , the universe will not entre the einstein cosmology .    due to the friedmann equation",
    "is modified in lqc , the dynamical equations in lqc are different from the ones in ec . under the help of the simplified equations of fixed points , we discussed the dynamical behavior for two different interacting models in lqc .",

    "the values of those parameters also should be constrained by the observation data , it is discuss by many authors @xcite in ec , but it is still need more studying in lqc . also , just as we expecting , the unstable region in lqc , the universe will entre an oscillatory regime and avoid the singularity which always happens in ec .",
