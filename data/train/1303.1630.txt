    "spin waves are collective propagations of precessional motions of magnetic moments in magnetic materials .",
    "magnonics research investigates how the spin wave propagates in the sub - micrometer length scale and sub - nanosecond time scale .",
    "@xcite especially , the propagation of spin waves in periodically nanostructured magnetic materials dubbed as magnonic crystals  @xcite are of one of its central interests .",
    "owing to the periodic structurings , the spin wave spectrum in magnonic crystal acquires allowed frequency bands of spin wave modes and forbidden - frequency bands dubbed as magnonic band gap .  @xcite like in other solid - state engineering such as electronics , photonics and plasmonics , the main application direction is to explore ability of spin waves to carry and process information .",
    "compared to others , magnonics has a much better prospect for miniaturization of the device , because the velocity of a spin wave is typically several orders slower than those of light and electrons in solids .",
    "recently , the authors proposed a spin - wave analog of integer quantum hall ( iqh ) state ,  @xcite which has unidirectional edge modes for spin - wave propagation .",
    "iqh state is a two - dimensional electron system with broken time - reversal symmetry , which supports unidirectional electric conducting channels along the boundaries ( edges ) of the system .",
    "@xcite the number of the unidirectional ( chiral ) edge modes is determined by a certain kind of topological number defined for _ bulk _ electronic states , called as the first chern integer .",
    "@xcite based on a linearized landau - lifshitz equation , we have generalized the chern integer well - established in quantum hall physics into the context of the spin wave physics , to argue that non - zero chern integer for spin - wave _ volume - mode _ bands results in an emergence of chiral spin - wave edge mode .",
    "@xcite    the proposed edge mode has a chiral dispersion with a band gap for volume - mode bands , which supports a unidirectional propagation of spin degree of freedom for a frequency within the gap .",
    "the sense of rotation and the number of the chiral mode is determined by the topological number for volume - mode bands below the gap , which itself can be changed by closing the band gap .",
    "these features allow us control the chiral edge modes in terms of band - gap manipulation , which could realize novel spintronic devices such as spin current splitter and spin - wave logic gates .",
    "@xcite to have these devices in real experimental systems , however , it is quite important to have a number of actual magnonic crystals , in which spin - wave volume mode bands take various non - zero chern integers .    from its electronic analogue ,",
    "@xcite it is expected that non - zerzo chern integers for spin - wave volume - mode bands result from strong spin - orbit coupled interactions , such as magnetic dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "namely , having an inner product between spin operator and coordinate operator , the magnetic dipolar interaction locks the relative rotational angle between the spin space and orbital space , just in the same way as the relativistic spin - orbit interaction does in electronic systems .",
    "@xcite as a result of the spin - orbit locking , the complex - valued character in the spin space ( i.e. one of the three pauli matrices ) is transferred into wavefunctions in the orbital space .",
    "especially , in the presence of finite out - of - plane ferromagnetic moments in the spin space , the symmetry argument allows the chern integer for volume - mode bands to have non - zero integer - value . in the recent work , employing a standard plane - wave theory , we have showed that a two - dimensional ( @xmath0-@xmath1 ) bi - component magnonic crystal under an out - of - plane field ( along the @xmath2-direction ) acquires spin - wave volume - mode bands with non - zero chern integers , when magnetic dipolar interaction dominates over short - ranged isotropic exchange interaction . from the state - of - art nanotechnology , however , it is not easy to synthesize the proposed bi - component magnonic crystal experimentally . moreover , the proposed model is not simple enough to see how magnetic dipolar interaction leads to non - zero chern integers for spin - wave volume - mode bands .    in the present paper ,",
    "we introduce much simpler thin - film magnetic models , which also support spin - wave volume modes with non - zero chern integers and chiral spin - wave edge modes , under the field normal to the two - dimensional plane .",
    "based on the models , we show that the chiral edge modes have frequency - wavelength dispersions within a band gap for spin - wave volume modes , and their chiral directions are determined by a sign of the chern integer for a spin - wave volume mode below the gap . using a simple tight - binding model composed of ` atomic orbitals ' , we further argue that the level inversion between the parity - odd atomic orbital ( such as @xmath3-wave orbital ) and parity - even atomic orbital ( such as @xmath4-wave orbital ) leads to a band inversion , which endows spin - wave volume - mode bands with non - zero chern integers .",
    "we expect that these findings would give useful prototype models for future designing of more realistic magnonic crystals which support topological chiral spin - wave edge modes .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in the next two sections",

    "iii ) . in section iv , we show how chiral spin - wave edge modes appear and how they change their directions on increasing the field .",
    "the results shows that the sense of the rotation of chiral edge mode is indeed determined by the sign of the chern integer defined for the spin - wave volume mode . in section v , we introduce a tight - binding description of linearized landau - lifshitz equations in the context of the present models . in sec.va",

    "@xcite    to have volume - mode bands with finite chern integers , we generally need multiple - band degree of freedom within a unit cell of magnonic crsytal . to this end , we consider two models ; decorated square - lattice model and honeycomb lattice model ( see fig .  [",

    "such modes can be also regarded as multiple - band degree of freedom , so that a system with only one ferromagnetic island within a unit cell of magnonic crystal  @xcite could also have a chance to provide volume mode bands with finite chern integer and associated chiral edge modes .",

    "in this paper , we introduced two simple magnetic thin - film models , in which ferromagnetic nanoislands on periodic arrays are coupled with each other via magnetic dipolar interaction . under the field applied perpendicular to the two - dimensional plane , spin - wave excitations in the systems have a chiral spin - wave edge mode localized at the boundaries of the systems , whose dispersion runs across a band gap for spin - wave volume modes .",
    "the sense of the rotation of the chiral edge mode is determined by a sign of the chern integer for a spin - wave volume - mode band below the band gap .",
    "to have volume - mode bands with finite chern integer , we generally need multiple - band degree of freedom within a unit cell . to this end , we considered two periodic arrays of ferromagnetic particles ; decorated square - lattice model and honeycomb - lattice model .",
    "for the decorated square - lattice model , we observed that , on increasing the out - of - plane field , there appears a sequence of band touchings between pairs of neighboring volume - mode bands .",
    "owing to these band touchings , the chern integers for the volume modes change their signs and , concomitantly , the chiral edge mode changes its sense of rotation from clockwise to anticlockwise or vice versa . for the decorated honeycomb - lattice model",
    ", we observed a finite band gap between the lowest spin - wave volume - mode band and second lowest spin - wave band which are connected by a chiral dispersion of an edge mode .",
    "though its sense of rotation being unchanged by the strength of the field in the honeycomb lattice case , the gap and the chiral edge mode persists for a sufficiently large field .    to interpret these results , we next construct tight - binding descriptions for the linearized landau - lifshitz equation , in which atomic orbitals such as @xmath4-wave , @xmath438-wave and @xmath258-wave orbitals are introduced within each unit cell . among other , complex - valued characters in",
    "the @xmath438-wave orbitals break both the time - reversal symmetry and mirror symmetries of the models .",
    "these symmetry breakings lead to a non - zero chern integer for spin - wave volume - mode bands and associated chiral spin - wave edge modes . using this tight - binding model",
    ", we argue that the level inversions among different atomic orbital levels give rise to the so - called _ inverted _ spin - wave bands with non - zero chern integers .",
    "our tight - binding analysis for the square - lattice model gives quantitative criteria for the emergence of finite field ranges within which spin - wave volume - mode bands have non - zero chern integers .",
    "for the decorated honeycomb lattice model , we employ a perturbation analysis , starting from the large field limit .",
    "the analysis suggests that the effective hamiltonian in the large field limit always respects time - reversal symmetry and the hexagonal symmetry within the order of @xmath304 . due to the mirror operations in the hexagonal symmetry , the lowest two spin - wave bands form gapless dirac cone spectra at two inequivalent @xmath156-points .",
    "once @xmath305-order corrections are included , however , the time - reversal symmetry is lost and hexagonal symmetry reduces to its abelian subgroup having no mirror symmetries . as a result ,",
    "the gapless dirac - cone spectra acquire a finite mass of the order of @xmath305 , which leads to non - zero chern integer for the two lowest spin - wave bands .",
    "this argument explains why the spin - wave volume - mode bands with non - zero chern integers and associated chiral spin - wave edge mode persists in a very wide range of the field in the decorated honeycomb lattice model .    since a state - of - the - art sample production does not necessarily guarantee perfect periodic structurings , considering disorder effects associated with the lattice periodicity are experimentally relevant , which can be speculated from well - established knowledges of integer quantum hall physics .",
    "@xcite the effects are two - folded . when the strength of the disorders is smaller than a characteristic frequency scale of the band gap , those volume modes near the band gap become localized due to the disorders , while chiral edge mode itself is free from these weak disorders . as a result ,",
    "the frequency regime for the chiral spin - wave edge mode becomes even wider than that in the clean limit .",
    "when the strength of the disorders is increased to be larger than the scale of the band gap in the clean limit , however , the ` mobility gap ' closes and reopens .",
    "after the reopening the gap , the topological chiral edge mode disappears .",
    "@xcite the proposed chiral spin - wave edge mode is also robust against the boundary shape ; the edge modes persist in almost arbitrary shapes of the boundary , provided that the edge mode in the boundary has no interference with the other mode running along the opposite sample boundary .",
    "@xcite    it is also a non - trivial issue whether submicrometer - scale ferromagnetic islands behave as a single spin or not . in preceding experimental systems",
    "mentioned before ,  @xcite non - isotropic shapes of ferromagnetic islands give rise to strong magnetic dipolar anisotropies , forcing all the spins in each island to point along a same direction . in our model calculations , magnetic anisotropies within each island",
    "are not included from the outset .",
    "it is interesting to include these magnetic dipolar anisotropies into the present landau - lifshitz equation phenomenologically as the ` single - ion ' type magnetic anisotropies .",
    "it is also equally likely that a ferromagnetic island has a couple of low - frequency relevant modes having different spin textures within the island .",
    "such modes can be also utilized as a kind of ` atomic orbital ' , so that a system with only one ferromagnetic island within a unit cell could also have a chance to provide a volume - mode bands with finite chern integers .",
    "exploring such systems is , however , beyond the scope of the present paper and we leave them for future open issues .",
