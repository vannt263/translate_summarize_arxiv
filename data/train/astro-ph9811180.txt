    "ngc 4342 is a low luminosity ( @xmath3 ) edge - on s0 galaxy in the virgo cluster , displaying both an outer disk ( @xmath4 ) and a stellar nuclear disk ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the data consists of long slit spectroscopy obtained from the ground , and of multi - color photometry and single aperture spectroscopy obtained with hst ( see van den bosch , jaffe & van der marel 1998 ) .",
    "we modelled this complex mass distribution using the multi gaussian expansion technique of emsellem , monnet & bacon ( 1994 ) .",
    "we have first constructed simple dynamical models assuming a distribution function ( df ) of the form @xmath6 . under the assumption of constant mass to light ratio ( m / l )",
    ", we have solved the jeans equations and compared the projected velocity dispersions ( after seeing convolution and pixel binning ) to the observations .",
    "although this model shows some discrepancies with the data , it suggests a bh mass in the range ( 3 - 6)@xmath7 ( see cretton & van den bosch 1998 for details ) .",
    "these models can not fit simultaneously the two data sets , suggesting a more sophisticated type of modeling ( three - integral df ) .",
    "our scheme follows schwarzschild s method with an extension towards the use of kinematic constraints : we first deproject the surface brightness to obtain a three - dimensional mass density distribution ( assuming a constant m / l ) . from the poisson equation",
    "the gravitational potential corresponding to the stellar body is derived . at that stage , a dark component ( bh or dark halo )",
    "can be added to the potential . in this total potential , a large library of orbits",
    "is computed and projected onto the observable space ( position on the sky , line - of - sight velocities ) . again",
    "the necessary steps of seeing convolution and pixel binning are performed for a fair comparison to the data .",
    "finally the orbital weights are computed that best reproduce the photometric and kinematic constraints ( see figure 1 for the kinematic fits of 3 models ) .",
    "the inclusion of the complete distribution of line - of - sight velocities greatly helps in constraining the final model .",
    "the three - integral models have more freedom than the simpler jeans models and have no problems fitting small features of the data ( e.g. in the rotation curve ) . moreover ,",
    "contrary to the two - integral models , they can fit simultaneously both data sets ( ground - based and hst ) .    to determine the exact values of m / l and bh mass , we compute a grid of models in ( m / l , bh ) and use @xmath8-statistics to assign confidence levels ( see figure 2 ) . on the basis of the complete data set , models without bh",
    "can be ruled out at a confidence level @xmath9 99.73 % .",
    "the best fit values for a ( m / l , bh ) are @xmath10 : model b in figure 2 . therefore in this galaxy , the ratio bh mass to bulge mass ( @xmath11 ) is the highest currently known ( 2.6% ) , together with the case of ngc 3115 ( see e.g. , ho 1998 ) .",
    "-2truecm -0.5truecm    -2 cm -0.5 cm    -3 cm",
    "figure 3 shows the second order velocity moments and velocity dispersions of models a , b and c averaged over a cone of opening angle 15@xmath12around the equatorial plane .",
    "this region contains the inner and outer discs , but in the very center , the bulge contribution dominates the light .",
    "models a , b and c mainly differ in the center ( due to different bh masses ) . outside",
    "@xmath13 , @xmath14 dominates the dynamics in accordance with the rapid rotation of the outer disk . from @xmath13 to @xmath15 , we pass from the _ azimuthally _ anisotropic bulge into a _ radially _ anisotropic region : the dynamically cold outer disk built up of close - to - circular orbits with low @xmath16 .",
    "models b and c have @xmath17 remarkably constant at @xmath18 , and are thus not too different from two - integral models ( for which this ratio is exactly 1.0 ) .",
    "the same has been observed in m32 , one of the few galaxies for which three - integral models have been constructed ( van der marel et al .",
    "merritt and collaborators ( see this volume ) have proposed that , under the influence of a central bh , box orbits are destroyed and the global mass distribution evolves towards axisymmetry ( see also gerhard & binney 1985 ) . at the same time , this tends to erase any dependence on a third integral in the df , consistent with what we have found here . when @xmath19 is @xmath20 , the very short ( @xmath21  one crossing time ) evolution towards axisymmetry provides a negative feedback mechanism that limits the bh mass by cutting off its fuel suply ( merritt & quinlan 1998 ) .",
    "therefore in this scenario , the maximum bh mass that can be accreted in the center is @xmath22 , close to the observed maximum .",
    "the main change going from model  a to model  c , is a strong increase of @xmath23 in the inner @xmath24 . in this region",
    "the circular velocities increase strongly with increasing bh mass .",
    "nevertheless , all three models provide an almost equally good fit to the observed rotation velocities because , going from model a to c , the ratio of @xmath25-orbits over @xmath26-orbits increases in the interval @xmath27 .",
    "this causes the net streaming motions of all three models to be roughly similar despite the large differences in circular velocities and explains the strong increase in @xmath16 ."
