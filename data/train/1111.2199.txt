    "radial motion of a charged test particle with orbital angular momentum in the field of super - extreme charged central body have been considered in @xcite .",

    "we consider oscillations of a particle caused by a small perturbation of a circular orbit .",

    "we consider perturbations that are caused by the change in energy of the particle and the change in mass of the central object .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system , the equation of motion and the effective potential have the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the mass and charge of the central body , @xmath3 - the mass , the orbital angular momentum and energy of the test particle .",
    "minimum of the effective potential @xmath4 determines the circular orbit @xmath5 of a particle .",
    "in this case , small deviations of the particles world line can be reduced to a canonical transformation @xmath6 . expanding the new hamiltonian near an equilibrium position , and taking into account that the first derivatives and mixed derivatives equal zero , we obtain @xmath7 comparing this hamiltonian with a classical oscillator hamiltonian , we obtain the expression for the oscillation frequency @xmath8 the formula for @xmath9 is not given in terms of @xmath10 in order to reduce the paper length .",

    "note that the frequency of small oscillations of the particles @xmath9 ( see ( [ eq:1.7 ] ) ) is measured relative to the time an infinitely distant observer @xmath20 , whereas the frequency @xmath21 ( see ( [ eq:19 ] ) ) - relative to the proper time .",
    "the oscillation frequency @xmath22 of a source , measured by a distant observer , and the oscillation frequency @xmath23 of the same source relative to the proper time are connected by the relation @xmath24 therefore , in the case of small oscillations of the particles around the equilibrium position , we have the following relation between frequencies ( [ eq:1.7 ] ) and ( [ eq:19 ] ) @xmath25",
