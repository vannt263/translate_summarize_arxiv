    "this article is a written record of the lectures delivered at the 1992 nato summer school in montreal .",
    "the spirit of the lectures was informal , and we have tried to preserve the informality and didactic quality of the lectures .",
    "the lectures dealt with several related topics , all involving computations of dynamical systems .",
    "the emphasis here stresses topics that have not yet been fully developed in other recent papers .",
    "accordingly , they reflect to a large extent `` work in progress '' rather than presenting a summary and review that makes a finished mathematical tale .",
    "there is also a lack of rigor that reflects a pragmatic approach that seeks reliable answers to questions even when these answers can not be totally integrated into formal mathematical theory .",
    "our goal is to answer questions about specific dynamical systems .",
    "if @xmath0 defines a @xmath1 parameter family of vector fields , we would like to know everything about the phase portraits of @xmath2 and the bifurcations that occur as parameters are varied .",
    "since most dynamical systems can not be integrated in terms of analytic expressions that are valid for all time , this is a task that can only be approached sensibly through numerical computation .",
    "this is problematic for mathematicians because naive error estimates tend to grow exponentially with iterative calculations such as the numerical integration of a vector field . for the most part",
    ", we ignore this difficulty and proceed with confidence that computers provide good approximations to trajectories of vector fields . we seek to find additional algorithms that allow us to calculate aspects of dynamical systems that are hard to determine otherwise .",
    "though these lectures do not emphasize applications , our interests extend beyond individual algorithms to the implementation of efficient and powerful problem solving environments for the analysis of dynamical systems and their bifurcations @xcite .",
    "the stable and unstable manifolds of equilibrium points are important geometric objects in the phase portraits of vector fields .",
    "the stable manifold theorem asserts their existence , and some proofs of the stable manifold theorem are constructive ; e.g. @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the numerical computation of stable and unstable manifolds of dimension larger than one presents difficulties .",
    "this section describes some of these difficulties and sketches an approach that leads to a reasonable algorithm for displaying the two - dimensional stable manifold of the lorenz system @xcite .",
    "we begin by recalling the stable manifold theorem for equilibria of finite - dimensional vector fields :    let @xmath3 be a @xmath4 vector field on an n - dimensional manifold @xmath5 with an equilibrium point @xmath6 and flow @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath8 be the linearization of @xmath3 at @xmath6 .",
    "assume that @xmath9 splits as an invariant direct sum @xmath10 with the spectrum of @xmath11 in the open left half plane of @xmath12 and the spectrum of @xmath13 in the open right half plane of @xmath12 .",
    "then there are @xmath4 submanifolds @xmath14 and @xmath15 passing through @xmath6 with tangent spaces @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively with the following property : @xmath18 @xmath19 if @xmath7 is complete , then @xmath14 and @xmath15 are @xmath20 immersions of euclidean spaces into @xmath5 .",
    "there is a naive approach to computing the stable manifold of an equilibrium that can be derived from the simplest proofs of the stable manifold theorem .",
    "if @xmath6 is an equilibrium point with the linearization at @xmath6 having stable manifold @xmath16 and unstable manifold @xmath17 , the stable manifold of @xmath6 can be represented in local coordinates as the graph of a function @xmath21 .",
    "near @xmath6 , each affine subspace parallel to @xmath17 intersects @xmath14 in a single point .",
    "the function @xmath22 has vanishing derivative at @xmath6 , so points of @xmath16 near @xmath6 form a good @xmath23 approximation to @xmath14 there .",
    "using the invariance of the stable manifold , the backwards trajectories starting on a sphere surrounding @xmath6 in @xmath16 sweep out an approximation to @xmath14 .",
    "one can choose a set of initial conditions on @xmath16 and compute their trajectories to visualize @xmath14 , but the process often works poorly .",
    "let us examine the lorenz system as an example .",
    "the equations of the lorenz system are @xmath24 with `` standard '' parameters @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 . for these parameters ,",
    "the origin is a saddle point with a two - dimensional stable manifold and a one - dimensional unstable manifold .",
    "the linearization at the origin is given by the matrix @xmath28 the negative eigenvalues of this matrix are approximately @xmath29 and @xmath30 with a ratio that is approximately @xmath31 .",
    "there are two problems associated with the large ratio between these eigenvalues .",
    "first , `` most '' trajectories in the stable manifold approach the origin from directions close to the @xmath32 axis which is the eigendirection of the eigenvalue @xmath33 .",
    "this can be seen readily by solving the linear system @xmath34 the trajectories of this system lie along the curves @xmath35 .",
    "points uniformly distributed on the unit circle approach the origin with much higher density close to the @xmath36 axis if @xmath37 .",
    "the second problem is that the trajectories flow much faster in the eigendirection of the eigenvalue of larger magnitude than in the eigendirection of the weaker eigenvalue .",
    "a small circle of initial conditions in the stable manifold will flow backwards to an ellipse whose axes have a ratio approximately @xmath38 after one unit of time .",
    "thus a fixed time integration of the vector field on a set of initial conditions clustered near the weak eigendirection still will yield a set of points that stretches along the strong eigendirection .",
    "this discussion indicates that strategies for drawing stable manifolds based solely upon the numerical integration of trajectories starting from initial values near the equilibrium may be ineffective . to obtain approximations to large regions of a stable manifold ,",
    "our approach is to mimic the construction of `` geodesic coordinates '' in differential geometry .",
    "we describe the general construction .",
    "let @xmath6 be a hyperbolic equilibrium point of a vector field @xmath3 on a riemannian manifold @xmath5 and let @xmath39 be the stable manifold of @xmath6 .",
    "we make use of the riemannian metric induced on @xmath40 from its embedding in the ambient riemannian manifold m. there is a neighborhood @xmath41 of @xmath6 in @xmath40 such that @xmath42 is foliated by spheres @xmath43 which lie at a distance @xmath44 from @xmath6 in the riemannian metric .",
    "we would like to write a differential equation for the evolution of these spheres with increasing @xmath44 , and this is easy to do when the vector field @xmath3 is not tangent to @xmath43 .",
    "the fundamental observation that allows us to proceed is that the tangent space @xmath45 to @xmath40 at @xmath46 is spanned by @xmath3 and @xmath47 as long as the vector field is not tangent to @xmath43 .",
    "the unique geodesic in @xmath40 from @xmath6 to any point of the sphere @xmath43 is characterized by the requirement that it is orthogonal to @xmath43 and that its tangent has unit length and lies in the subspace spanned by the tangents to @xmath43 and the vector field @xmath3 .",
    "this provides the motivation for an algorithm to evolve the sphere @xmath43 by extending the geodesics through @xmath6 and points on the sphere , as pictured in figure [ geodesic ] .",
    "[ geodesic ]    let @xmath3 be a @xmath4 vector field on an n - dimensional riemannian manifold @xmath5 with a hyperbolic equilibrium point @xmath6 and flow @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath40 be the @xmath48-dimensional stable manifold of @xmath6 and let @xmath43 be the geodesic sphere at distance @xmath44 from @xmath6 in the riemannian metric induced on @xmath40 .",
    "if @xmath3 is not tangent to @xmath43 , then the vector field obtained by orthogonally projecting @xmath3 onto the normal bundle of @xmath43 is tangent to the geodesic rays of @xmath40 emanating from @xmath6 .",
    "there may well be tangencies between the vector field @xmath3 and the geodesic spheres @xmath43 in a stable manifold . when this happens , it is no longer a simple matter to `` evolve '' @xmath43 as a submanifold without additional geometric information .",
    "we approach the problem with the question of determining when does the set of trajectories passing through a submanifold @xmath49 of initial conditions form a smooth submanifold @xmath40 .",
    "we point out two difficulties .",
    "the following example illustrates one problem that occurs if there are isolated points of tangency between @xmath3 and @xmath49 .",
    "let @xmath3 be the vector field @xmath50 in @xmath51 and let @xmath49 be the @xmath52 axis .",
    "the vector field @xmath3 is tangent to @xmath49 at the origin .",
    "the flow of @xmath3 is defined by the map @xmath53 .",
    "the surface of trajectories with initial conditions on the curve @xmath49 is given by the map @xmath54 .",
    "the image of @xmath55 is a singular surface whose intersection with the plane @xmath56 is a cusp .",
    "this example indicates that given a smooth submanifold @xmath49 of dimension @xmath57 , there are simple vector fields with the property that the trajectories passing through the submanifold do not form a smooth surface of dimension @xmath48 .",
    "locally , a submanifold @xmath49 may be evolved by a vector field @xmath3 in such a fashion , as long as the tangent spaces to @xmath49 do not contain @xmath3 . however , at points of tangency additional information is required to ensure that the trajectories through @xmath49 will form a smooth submanifold .",
    "there is a further difficulty that we encounter in evolving submanifolds .",
    "suppose that @xmath40 is a submanifold with boundary and that @xmath3 is a vector field with a segment of a trajectory @xmath22 in the boundary of @xmath40 .",
    "assume that @xmath40 is contained in the interior of an invariant manifold @xmath58 of the same dimension .",
    "it is not true that @xmath40 and the vector field define @xmath58 .",
    "if the trajectory @xmath22 never enters the interior of @xmath40 , then @xmath59 may consist of points whose trajectories do not intersect @xmath40 at all .",
    "for example , the most dramatic case occurs when the dimension of @xmath40 is two and the boundary of @xmath40 is a periodic orbit . in this case , we can not `` grow '' @xmath40 in the fashion that we wish to use for stable and unstable manifolds . on the other hand ,",
    "the scenario we have just described can not occur for a stable or unstable manifold , since these invariant manifolds are formed by a set of trajectories that are asymptotic to an equilibrium point .",
    "this story ends in an unfinished state .",
    "we would like to use algorithms based upon computing geodesics for computing stable and unstable manifolds because they display the geometry of the manifolds in a way that naive computation of trajectories does not . on the other hand ,",
    "there are mathematical difficulties with the formulation of algorithms that are based solely upon the computation of a vector field that will be tangent to geodesics .",
    "this is an area of research in which more work is warranted .",
    "the goal is to find a procedure that `` works '' for the largest possible class of examples , where the criterion of success is the ability to carry out the computation to a specified precision in a reasonable amount of time .",
    "figure  [ twodman ] shows a picture of the computed stable manifold for the origin of the lorenz system .",
    "[ twodman ]",
    "this section describes joint work in progress with mark myers and bernd sturmfels .",
    "the question we discuss involves the computation of points where hopf bifurcations occur in parametrized families of vector fields .",
    "let @xmath60 be a system of differential equations on @xmath61 depending upon a @xmath1-dimensional parameter @xmath62 .",
    "one of the first steps in a bifurcation analysis of this family is the determination of parameter values at which there are non - hyperbolic equilibrium points @xmath63 .",
    "these points are characterized by the conditions that @xmath64 and @xmath65 has a zero or purely imaginary eigenvalue . in both cases , the set of parameter values at which bifurcation occurs",
    "is expected to have codimension one in the parameter space .",
    "generically , the case of a zero eigenvalue is a saddle - node bifurcation while the case of pure imaginary eigenvalues is a hopf bifurcation @xcite .",
    "note that solving the equations describing either type of bifurcation does not involve numerical integration of the differential equations .",
    "instead , one has a root - finding problem to solve . since the jacobian @xmath65 depends upon @xmath2 , it is not immediately apparent that one can express this problem as a non - degenerate system of @xmath66 equations in @xmath67 variables .    for saddle - node bifurcations ,",
    "zero eigenvalues of the jacobian can be detected by computing the determinant of the jacobian .",
    "it is not difficult to prove that the map @xmath68 given by @xmath69 is non - degenerate for generic @xmath2 at most points @xcite .",
    "the fundamental example is given by the normal form for a saddle - node bifurcation : @xmath70 .",
    "in this example , @xmath71 is non - singular .",
    "the general saddle - node bifurcation can be transformed to this normal form by using the techniques of singularity theory @xcite . in implementing algorithms for computing saddle - node bifurcations ,",
    "we face questions about the efficiency and accuracy with which the determinant of the jacobian of a map can be computed .    we seek algorithms that will locate hopf bifurcations in a manner analogous to the computation of saddle - node bifurcations .",
    "thus , we want a map @xmath72 which vanishes when @xmath73 has an equilibrium at which there are a pair of pure imaginary eigenvalues .",
    "a basic aspect of this problem is finding a criterion for determining when a matrix has a pair of pure imaginary eigenvalues . a complete algebraic solution to",
    "this problem is more complex than finding a criterion for zero eigenvalues .",
    "the set of matrices with pure imaginary eigenvalues does not define an algebraic hypersurface in the space of matrices , but rather a semialgebraic set .",
    "let us see what this means in concrete terms for @xmath74 matrices .",
    "a @xmath75 matrix has pure imaginary eigenvalues if and only if its trace vanishes and its determinant is positive .",
    "thus the set of @xmath75 matrices with pure imaginary eigenvalues is specified by one equation _ and _ one inequality on the coefficients of the matrix .",
    "if we drop the inequality , then we find matrices with real eigenvalues of equal magnitude and opposite sign as well as matrices with pure imaginary eigenvalues .",
    "there are classical algebraic theories that address the question of when a matrix has a pair of pure imaginary eigenvalues .",
    "these theories are now best known in the form of the routh - hurwitz criteria that a matrix have all of its eigenvalues in the left half plane .",
    "we have applied these theories and continuation strategies in order to implement algorithms for computing hopf bifurcations . here",
    "we give a brief indication of the algebraic foundation for our algorithms that give criteria for a square matrix to have a pair of pure imaginary eigenvalues .",
    "for the remainder of this section , we let @xmath76 denote an @xmath77 real matrix and @xmath78 denote its characteristic polynomial .",
    "the roots of @xmath79 are the eigenvalues of @xmath76 .",
    "there are two approaches to our algebraic problem : to give criteria for the polynomial @xmath79 to have a pair of pure imaginary roots , or , alternatively , to give criteria for @xmath76 to have a pair of pure imaginary eigenvalues by performing algebraic transformations directly on @xmath76 .",
    "we make the basic observation that if a real polynomial @xmath79 has a pure imaginary root @xmath62 , then @xmath80 is also a root .",
    "thus a necessary condition for @xmath79 to have a pair of pure imaginary roots is that the polynomials @xmath79 and @xmath81 have a common root .",
    "sylvester resultant _ is a function of the coefficients of @xmath79 and @xmath82 that vanishes if and only if @xmath79 and @xmath82 share a common root .",
    "applied in the context of our problem , we first reduce the size of the problem by observing that the polynomials @xmath83 and @xmath84 are even and odd , respectively .",
    "moreover , @xmath79 and @xmath82 have a common root if and only if @xmath85 and @xmath49 have a common root .",
    "we can write @xmath86 and @xmath87 with @xmath88 and @xmath89 polynomials of degree approximately @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , the sylvester resultant of @xmath88 and @xmath89 gives a function that vanishes if and only if @xmath79 and @xmath82 have a common root or , equivalently , @xmath79 has two roots whose sum is zero .",
    "if we denote @xmath91 and @xmath92 is even , the sylvester resultant is the determinant of the matrix @xmath93 while if @xmath92 is odd , it is the determinant of the matrix @xmath94    the resultant encodes the outcome of applying the euclidean algorithm to a pair of polynomials .",
    "if two polynomials have a common root , then the euclidean algorithm yields the greatest common denominator of the two polynomials .",
    "the coefficients of this gcd can be expressed as determinants in the coefficients of the two polynomials .",
    "these determinants are the subresultants of the two polynomials .",
    "these resultants give explicit functions that define the locus of matrices that have eigenvalues whose sum is zero .",
    "they do not determine whether the roots are real or complex . for this purpose",
    ", one can use the theory of _ subresultants _ @xcite .",
    "we observe that a common root of @xmath79 and @xmath82 is imaginary if and only if the corresponding common root of @xmath88 and @xmath89 is negative .",
    "therefore , we can give explicit inequalities in terms of the subresultants that determine whether a polynomial with a single , simple pair of roots whose sum is zero has a pair of pure imaginary roots .",
    "table [ hopftable ] gives a list of the equations and inequalities that determine the polynomials @xmath79 of degree at most six with these properties .        ' '' ''",
    "@xmath92 & @xmath95 +    ' '' ''    @xmath96 & @xmath97 +    ' '' ''    @xmath98 & @xmath99 +    ' '' ''    @xmath100 & @xmath101 +    ' '' ''    @xmath102 & @xmath103 +    ' '' ''    @xmath104 & @xmath105 +    the computation of characteristic polynomials of square matrices is computationally expensive and prone to numerical errors for some types of matrices .",
    "thus , we seek methods that allow us to determine whether a matrix has a pair of pure imaginary eigenvalues without computing the characteristic polynomial as an intermediate step .",
    "this can be done through the definition of appropriate kronecker or tensor products .",
    "the basic algebraic idea is that there are transformations of matrices that produce matrices whose eigenvalues are functions of the eigenvalues of the original matrix . for example , if @xmath76 and @xmath106 are square matrices , then the eigenvalues of the tensor product @xmath107 are the pairwise products of the eigenvalues of @xmath76 and those of @xmath106 . if we form the transformation @xmath108 with @xmath109 the @xmath77 identity matrix , then the eigenvalues of @xmath110 are sums of pairs of eigenvalues of @xmath76 . to remove the redundancy associated with having both pairs @xmath111 and @xmath112 as eigenvalues , we use a skew - symmetric version construction . the _ bialternate product _",
    "@xmath113 of @xmath76 is the @xmath114 matrix defined by @xmath115 where the rows are labeled _ lexicographically _ by @xmath116 for @xmath117 and the columns likewise by @xmath118 for @xmath119 @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath113 are pairwise sums @xmath120 with @xmath121 of the eigenvalues of @xmath76 .",
    "thus , a necessary condition for @xmath76 to have a pair of pure imaginary eigenvalues is that @xmath122 be singular .",
    "this singularity can be tested by computing the determinant of @xmath122 , but we can also use other algorithms ( such as singular value decomposition ) from numerical linear algebra that give more accurate and robust tests for the singularity of @xmath76 . in our ongoing work , we are implementing algorithms for tracking hopf bifurcations based upon these algebraic methods and standard continuation methods .",
    "bifurcation theory describes qualitative changes in phase portraits that occur as parameters are varied in the definition of a dynamical system . for dynamical systems defined by vector fields on @xmath61",
    ", one has a system of equations of the form @xmath60 with @xmath123 denoting a @xmath1-dimensional vector of parameters .",
    "a rough classification of bifurcations distinguishes between _ local _ and _ global _ bifurcations , but it is difficult to make this distinction precise .",
    "heuristically , the dynamics of local bifurcations are determined by information contained in the germ of the taylor series of @xmath2 or a poincar return map at a point , whereas the dynamics of global bifurcations require information about the vector field along an entire ( non - periodic ) trajectory .",
    "while the theory of bifurcations in multi - parameter families is far from complete , the theory of global bifurcations is more fragmentary than that of local bifurcations",
    ". a number of `` codimension 2 '' global bifurcations have been studied , but there has not been an attempt to construct a synthesis of these studies that portrays a systematic view of the different cases and phenomena that occur .",
    "the lectures that were given in montreal at this nato sponsored summer school touched upon these matters , but these notes go much farther towards the construction of such a synthesis .",
    "we focus our attention on global bifurcations that involve homoclinic or heteroclinic orbits of equilibrium points of a vector field . we shall call homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits _ connecting _ orbits in order to have a common name for the two .",
    "silnikov seems to be the principal originator of the strategy we adopt to study global bifurcations with connecting orbits in higher dimensional vector fields . for planar vector fields ,",
    "the techniques are older and asymptotic methods for studying global bifurcations in planar vector fields were well developed by the 1920 s ( dulac  @xcite ) .",
    "the fundamental idea is that the recurrent behavior near a connecting orbit should be studied in a fashion similar to that used in studying periodic orbits via a poincar return map .",
    "in particular , codimension one cross sections to the flow are introduced , and the return map of these cross sections is studied .",
    "there are some additional complications in the study of connecting orbits compared to that of periodic orbits which significantly complicate the analysis .",
    "we mention three of these .",
    "first , the discrete maps that describe flow past an equilibrium point are singular . in the simplest cases of flow past non - resonant equilibrium points , these `` passage '' or `` correspondence '' maps have singularities of the form @xmath124 where @xmath125 is not an integer and may be complex if the equilibrium has complex eigenvalues .",
    "these singularities lead to analysis that is much more complicated and intricate than that associated with the return map of a periodic orbit .",
    "as the work presented by ilyashenko and calle at this summer school demonstrated , this analysis is frightfully complicated even for planar vector fields .",
    "the second complication arising from connecting orbits is that there are discontinuities in the return maps of cross sections that are associated with connecting orbits .",
    "the bifurcations and attractors that appear in the lorenz system @xcite give a vivid example of the consequences of these discontinuities and have been described by guckenheimer and williams @xcite .",
    "these discontinuities force one to look at dynamical systems that are built from multiple pieces rather than studying the iterates of a single continuous mapping .",
    "the third complication is that the list of cases of qualitatively different type is substantially longer than with local bifurcations .",
    "tools for treating all of the cases in a single analysis are lacking , so the construction of a comprehensive and complete theory seems like a daunting task .",
    "these lectures adopt a superficial view of the mathematical technicalities associated with global bifurcations . in constructing return maps for a flow along connecting orbits",
    ", one would like the simplest possible analytical expressions for these return maps .",
    "normal form theory explores how coordinate changes can be used to simplify these analytical expressions , but the theory produces a large and intricate story whose details can mask many of the phenomena that we want to study .",
    "the idea of silnikov was to relax the requirement that an exact normal form be used to describe passage past an equilibrium and to use an approximation to the normal form instead .",
    "asymptotic expansions for the flows and passage maps can be constructed , and one can begin the analysis of bifurcations with connecting orbits by using the leading term , or terms , of these asymptotic expansions . a similar approach to the global part of the flow producing returns to a cross section can also be used , but the asymptotic expansions of these smooth maps are given simply by taylor series .",
    "a matching procedure can then be used to represent the full return map as a composition of singular and regular maps that come from passage past equilibrium and parts of the flow that are non - singular . in constructing maps with such matching procedures",
    ", we must remember that there may be discontinuities that lead to the examination of several different sequences of compositions . following an analysis of return maps built from approximations",
    ", we can seek to determine the structural stability of the systems .",
    "it is unreasonable to expect that each type of bifurcation will have a structurally stable unfolding .",
    "we are plunged into the morass of considerations that result from the fact that structurally stable vector fields are not dense in the space of vector fields .",
    "the most that we try to do is to explore in each case which dynamical features of the bifurcation do persist under perturbations . note that even specifying which perturbations are to be allowed in a theory based upon the return maps of connecting orbits is a tricky matter due to the singularities of the maps . rather than engaging the reader in an extensive discussion of these problems ,",
    "we proceed past them while erecting signposts that point in the direction of unresolved and incomplete technical matters .",
    "let @xmath126 be a sufficiently smooth , vector field with a homoclinic orbit to an equilibrium point at @xmath127 .",
    "we shall denote the flow of @xmath55 by @xmath128 and the homoclinic orbit by @xmath129 .",
    "let @xmath130 we give a list of conditions that generic systems with a homoclinic orbit satisfy .",
    "these conditions help ensure that bifurcations from the homoclinic orbit have as simple a structure as possible . in classifying codimension two bifurcations of homoclinic orbits",
    ", we can then look at events that cause the failure of one of these genericity conditions and examine the effect on bifurcations in two parameter families .",
    "the first condition is that the equilibrium be hyperbolic and non - resonant .",
    "the non - resonance conditions that are important are primarily ones that involve the stable and unstable eigenvalues of smallest magnitude .",
    "we call these eigenvalues the _ principal eigenvalues _ of the equilibrium",
    ". more precisely , assume the linearization @xmath131 has @xmath1 eigenvalues in the left half plane and @xmath132 in the right half plane .",
    "assume there exists a real principal eigenvalue in the stable manifold denoted @xmath133 or a complex conjugate pair @xmath134 with the property that if @xmath62 is another stable eigenvalue of @xmath131 , then @xmath135 .",
    "similarly , assume there exists a real principal eigenvalue in the unstable manifold denoted @xmath136 or a complex conjugate pair @xmath137 with the property that if @xmath62 is another unstable eigenvalue of @xmath131 , then @xmath138 .    at points in the stable and unstable manifolds of @xmath127",
    ", there are filtrations of the tangent bundle associated with the exponential growth or decay of vectors as the trajectory approaches the origin . for a point @xmath6 of the stable manifold",
    ", we are interested in three subspaces that we denote @xmath139 and call the _ stable plus weak unstable manifold _ ,",
    "the _ stable manifold _ and the _ strong stable manifold _ , respectively .",
    "these are defined via the variational equation for the trajectory through the point @xmath6 given by @xmath140 let @xmath141 denote the solution to this linear equation with initial condition @xmath142 .",
    "let @xmath143 and @xmath144 be numbers such that @xmath145 for any eigenvalue @xmath62 of @xmath131 which is not a principal eigenvalue .",

    "associated with the origin itself is a strong stable manifold @xmath152 consisting of points @xmath153 , the stable manifold of the origin as defined by the stable manifold theorem , for which the vector field @xmath148 lies in @xmath154 .",

    "almost all trajectories in @xmath14 lie in @xmath158 .",
    "similarly , almost all trajectories in @xmath15 lie in @xmath159 .",

    "this may alternatively be expressed by requiring that a point @xmath6 on @xmath160 satisfy @xmath162    the final condition that we impose upon generic homoclinic orbits involves the derivative of the flow along the homoclinic orbit .",
    "we state the condition in terms of the stable plus weak unstable and the unstable plus weak stable manifolds . depending upon the types of the principal eigenvalues , the sum of the dimensions of @xmath163 and @xmath164",

    "a vector field with an equilibrium point that satisfies a resonance condition of order @xmath1 usually can not be linearized by a @xmath187 coordinate transformation . nonetheless , there are _ resonant normal forms _ for the equilibrium with the property that there are smooth coordinate changes that transform the degree @xmath188 taylor series of the vector field at the equilibrium to its resonant normal form",
    ". we can hope in these situations that it is feasible to describe explicitly the flow of the resonant normal forms truncated to degree @xmath188 and that these flows serve as good approximations to the flow of the original vector field in the vicinity of the equilibrium point . here",
    "the classical theory breaks down and does not provide a good solution to the question as to when the passage map of two flows near an equilibrium are good approximations to one another .",
    "consider a _ linear _ vector field @xmath189 with a hyperbolic equilibrium point at the origin with @xmath1 stable eigenvalues and @xmath132 unstable eigenvalues .",
    "choose a coordinate system so that the stable and unstable manifolds @xmath14 and @xmath15 of the origin lie in coordinate planes .",

    "if we choose different neighborhoods of the origin , then we can sometimes compute the exit time from the neighborhood . in the case of real eigenvalues",
    ", we find that there are power law singularities ; complex eigenvalues produce singularities with other elementary functions .",

    "for some problems of higher codimension , we shall need to compute the passage maps of equilibrium points that are either resonant or nonhyperbolic .",

    ", we would like to obtain formulas that remain valid when we perturb the equilibrium to make it generic .",
    "this requires some additional care beyond merely solving the explicit flows for the passage map at the resonant equilibrium .",
    "the silnikov procedure is to combine the local passage maps near equilibria with nonsingular maps that describe the flow between cross sections around the portions of connecting orbits that do not contain equilibria . in the case of a homoclinic orbit",
    ", these cross sections can be taken to be portions of the boundary of the neighborhood @xmath190 that was used to construct the passage map past the equilibrium . as with the passage maps , we seek approximations for these `` global '' maps between cross sections .",
    "since the maps are nonsingular , they can be approximated by truncating their taylor series .",
    "generally , we start with affine approximations to the transformations . if these are inadequate to obtain the ( structural ) stability results we seek , then higher degree approximations are used .",
    "the return map for a cross section can be obtained by composing these global maps with the local passage maps . in carrying through this composition",
    ", care must be taken with understanding the domains on which the maps are defined .",
    "when there are multiple connecting orbits , there is the additional possibility that flow in different directions away from an equilibrium may produce structures that require following different patterns of return to a neighborhood of the equilibrium .",
    "the difficulties of proving rigorous theorems about the unfoldings of bifurcations are formidable .",
    "nonetheless , we would like to prove as much about phenomena that are consequences of bifurcations of homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits as we can .",
    "indeed , we would like to capture the major dynamical events that occur in the unfolding despite the fact that structural stability of the unfoldings will often fail . to make the theory `` local '' to the bifurcating orbits , we restrict attention to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of these orbits .",
    "recurrent behavior that involves trajectories that leave such a neighborhood will be discussed separately . here",
    "we describe three types of structures that can occur in small neighborhoods of bifurcating connecting orbits .",
    "the first type of dynamical structure that can be involved at a homoclinic bifurcation is a periodic orbit .",
    "generic bifurcations of binodal homoclinic orbits produce periodic orbits whose stability is determined by the sum of the principal eigenvalues at the saddle . in higher codimensions , multiple periodic orbits can bifurcate . in some cases ( notably , the `` gluing bifurcation '' @xcite )",
    ", these orbits and their patterns of bifurcations can be complicated .",
    "the second type of dynamical structure produced in bifurcations of connecting orbits is typified by the homoclinic bifurcation in the lorenz system @xcite . in this system , for reasons of symmetry , a pair of homoclinic orbits are formed .",
    "as they bifurcate , a horseshoe is immediately created .",
    "the same phenomenon occurs in higher codimension bifurcations without symmetry .",
    "third , generic homoclinic orbits with complex values may be adjacent to horseshoes .",
    "as described by silnikov @xcite , homoclinic orbits to equilibria satisfying appropriate conditions on their eigenvalues occur only in the closure of horseshoes .",
    "as the homoclinic orbit is unfolded , the horseshoes closest to the homoclinic orbit can be destroyed .",
    "the singularity theory for mappings between two spaces is much `` cleaner '' than the bifurcation theory of flows ( or iterated mappings ) .",
    "there are a number of reasons for these differences , one being the complex dynamical structures that occur in unfoldings of certain bifurcations .",
    "if there are horseshoes that are created or destroyed as part of a bifurcation , then the unfolding of these bifurcations will involve all of the associated complications . these have been studied most thoroughly in the context of the hnon mapping @xcite .",
    "there are an infinite number of bifurcations of periodic orbits that are part of the creation of horseshoes . if there is a single unstable eigenvalue and volume contraction in these flows , there are also phenomena such as infinitely many ( newhouse ) sinks and the occurrence of nonhyperbolic strange attractors @xcite .",
    "we do not want to become enmeshed in these details . to a large extent",
    "they appear to be subsidiary to the fact that horseshoes are created , and we expect to add little to the general discussion of the processes associated with the creation and destruction of the horseshoes",
    ". our focus in dealing with horseshoes will be to demonstrate that a return map in an unfolding satisfies the conditions that guarantee the existence of horseshoes .",
    "we will not generally explore whether the horseshoe is part of a larger invariant set or investigate the presence of nonhyperbolic invariant sets in the unfoldings .",
    "there are many types of codimension two bifurcations of connecting orbits .",
    "failure of one of the conditions that characterize a generic homoclinic orbit will lead to a degenerate bifurcation .",
    "these can be classified into four groups :    1 .",
    "eigenvalue degeneracies 2 .   degenerate approach 3 .   degenerate twist 4 .",
    "multiple connecting orbits    each of these types can be further subdivided .",
    "for example , the eigenvalue degeneracies may be due to a single zero eigenvalue , a pair of pure imaginary eigenvalues , equal magnitude of the real parts of the principal eigenvalues , or equal magnitude of a real principal eigenvalue with the sum of a pair of imaginary principal eigenvalues .",
    "furthermore , one has a different analysis depending on whether the homoclinic orbit is nodal , unifocal or bifocal , and , in the nodal case , the twist associated with a resonance . in all of the cases that have been studied , the introduction of silnikov coordinates and the study of return maps built from these coordinates is a major portion of the analysis of the bifurcation .",
    "rigorous results that go beyond the description of model systems tend to be very difficult to formulate and prove .",
    "when there are horseshoes associated with these bifurcations , even the phenomenology associated with the silnikov approximations tends to be incomplete .",
    "below we discuss a bifurcation with an eigenvalue degeneracy , one with a degenerate approach , and another with multiple connecting orbits , describing each in terms of silnikov approximations .",
    "additionally , within each category , we give a survey of other work known to us .",
    "for the case of degenerate approach , we refer the reader to the work of terman @xcite .",
    "there are a number of different eigenvalue degeneracies which may occur .",
    "non - hyperbolic equilibrium point degeneracies have been studied by , in the nodal case , deng @xcite , lukyanov @xcite and schecter @xcite ; in the case of unifocal homoclinic orbits with a nonhyperbolic saddle , belyakov @xcite ; and , in the case of unifocal homoclinic orbits with a nonhyperbolic focus , argoul , arneodo and richetti @xcite , bosch and simo @xcite , gaspard and wang @xcite , and hirschberg and knobloch @xcite . here we will look at vector fields that have a homoclinic orbit with real principal eigenvalues of equal magnitude . the homoclinic orbit may be twisted or untwisted , and the bifurcation is different , depending on the case .",

    "this yields @xmath230 as @xmath205 , observe that the ratio of the values of @xmath210 that produce period doubling and twice rounding homoclinic orbits approaches @xmath231 .",
    "this ratio is a `` universal '' property of this codimension two bifurcation . as with the untwisted resonant bifurcation ,",

    "we describe one of these cases , illustrating that horseshoes can occur in the unfolding of this codimension two global bifurcation .",

    "we shall assume further that the return map for the orbit is degenerate in the twisting of the normal bundle around the homoclinic orbit .",
    "this means that a vector , pointing in the direction of the principal stable eigenvector as the homoclinic orbit leaves the origin , returns in the direction of the strong stable manifold ( rather than the generic behavior of returning in the direction of the unstable manifold ) .",

    "there are zero , one or two periodic orbits .",

    "other connecting orbit bifurcations have been studied by chow , deng and fiedler @xcite , deng @xcite , glendinning and sparrow @xcite , glendinning and tresser @xcite , and schecter @xcite      the numerical computation of connecting orbits has only recently been investigated , and the construction of robust algorithms that effectively compute connecting orbits in large classes of vector fields remains a challenge .",
    "we make a few comments concerning the numerical difficulties and fewer suggestions for how these difficulties might be confronted . we seek to solve the following problems . in generic one",
    "parameter families of vector fields , there are isolated points with connecting orbits between equilibrium points .",
    "we want accurate calculations of these parameter values and of the resulting orbits .",
    "( there may also be accumulation points of connecting orbits of increasing length and complicated topological structure in generic one parameter families @xcite . ) in generic two parameter families of vector fields , there are curves of parameter values at which connecting orbits occur .",
    "we seek to use continuation methods to compute these curves .",
    "the endpoints of these curves of homoclinic and heteroclinic bifurcations are frequently global codimension two bifurcations .",
    "we seek to classify these codimension two bifurcations and construct algorithms for their computation .",
    "the unfoldings of some of these codimension two bifurcations have been described above , but there is a long list of cases that have yet to be analyzed fully  even at the level of silnikov approximations .",
    "thus the goal of implementing the computation of unfoldings of global codimension two bifurcations involves mathematical as well as computational questions .",
    "generic connecting orbits are intersections of stable and unstable manifolds of equilibria .",
    "therefore , algorithms for the reliable calculation of these invariant manifolds might seem to form the basis for computation of the connecting orbits .",
    "this strategy is clearly an expensive one from a computational point of view , so we seek more direct methods for computing connecting orbits . in practice ,",
    "most examples in higher dimensional vector fields have been computed by tracking periodic orbits that bifurcate from homoclinic orbits , with high period periodic orbits used as approximations to the homoclinic orbits .",
    "when the periodic orbits involved are not stable , then tracking the periodic orbits requires the use of algorithms for solving boundary value problems or algorithms that find fixed points of a cross section . since the periodic orbits usually disappear at the homoclinic orbit , these computations are hard to implement in an automatic fashion .",
    "we seek methods that are more direct .",
    "mathematically , a connecting orbit is the solution of a boundary value problem on an infinite interval of time . to construct algorithms based upon boundary value solvers for finding connecting orbits ,",
    "one wants to convert the problem into one involving a finite time interval .",
    "this can be done approximately by introducing linear ( or polynomial ) approximations for the local stable and unstable manifolds containing the ends of the connecting orbits and seeking trajectories that begin on the local unstable manifold and end on the local stable manifold .",
    "beyn @xcite , chow and lin @xcite , doedel and friedman @xcite and schecter @xcite have all considered algorithmic aspects of the computation of homoclinic orbits , but the only computations that have been examined carefully involve planar vector fields .",
    "one of the pragmatic questions concerning the computation of homoclinic bifurcations is whether the goal is to obtain an accurate approximation of the parameter values at which the bifurcation occurs or whether one is primarily interested in the computation of an accurate approximation to the homoclinic orbit .",
    "these are substantially different questions for reasons that we now describe .",
    "suppose a small error has been made in the determination of the parameter value @xmath210 for which there is a homoclinic orbit in a system .",
    "we ask whether there is a trajectory for parameter value @xmath313 that closely approximates the homoclinic orbit that exists for parameter value @xmath210 .",
    "the distance of closest approach between the stable and unstable manifolds will be of order @xmath314 since compact portions of the manifolds vary smoothly with the parameters .",
    "thus we want to know how close the trajectory through a point close to the stable manifold comes to the equilibrium .",
    "estimates can be obtained from linear vector fields .",
    "consider a linear vector field @xmath3 with a hyperbolic equilibrium point at the origin and assume that the stable and unstable manifolds are coordinate subspaces .",
    "the vector field `` separates '' into a stable system and an unstable system . along trajectories ,",
    "the unstable coordinates grow at an exponential rate .",
    "now look at a generic point @xmath52 on the stable manifold and estimate the distance of closest approach to the equilibrium point of a trajectory passing through a point @xmath315 close to @xmath52 .",
    "if the difference @xmath316 has a non - zero component in the direction of the strongest unstable eigenvalue of @xmath3 , then this component will grow exponentially at a rate which is the eigenvalue of the strongest unstable eigenvalue . as we saw above , a generic point on the stable manifold approaches the equilibrium in the direction of the principal ( weakest ) stable eigenvalue . putting these observations together",
    ", we estimate the point of closest approach to the origin of the trajectory through @xmath315 as having order @xmath317 where @xmath318 is the component of @xmath315 in the strongest unstable direction and @xmath243 is the ratio of the magnitude of the principal stable eigenvalue to the strongest unstable eigenvalue . when @xmath319 is large , then small errors in locating a point on the unstable eigenvalue lead to much larger distances between the closest trajectory and the homoclinic orbit that is sought .",
    "if we formulate a boundary value problem to find the homoclinic orbit , then we will need to start with a very good approximation to the homoclinic orbit to have hope of being able to use the boundary value solver .",
    "trajectories depend very sensitively upon the parameters in a neighborhood of the equilibrium .",
    "these difficulties become still more extreme if one seeks the computation of a unifocal homoclinic orbit .",

    "the presence of double cycles where the two periodic orbits created at hopf bifurcation points coalesce and disappear has been established previously and the existence of saddle loops emanating from the takens - bogdanov points is predicted by bifurcation theory @xcite . to determine further information about global bifurcations , we rely upon numerical integrations that were performed with the computer program _",

    "the intent of this rapid tour of the complicated dynamics of a realistic biological model was to draw attention to the interplay between theory and numerical exploration .",
    "since many regions in the parameter space are very small , the theory helps to guide the exploration to discover the correct bifurcation diagram .",
    "in the previous sections , non - generic bifurcation has arisen in multiparameter families of vector fields and is a codimension two , or higher , phenomenon .",
    "non - generic bifurcation is often encountered in the real world as a result of symmetry and in this section we discuss the bifurcation of symmetric vector fields .    within a generic one parameter family of vector fields ,",
    "@xmath361 , bifurcations of equilibria are either saddle - node bifurcations , when a single eigenvalue passes through 0 , or hopf bifurcations , when a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues cross the imaginary axis .",
    "these are both well understood @xcite , but with symmetry , generic bifurcation can be much more complicated .",
    "one of our goals has been to explore how complex local bifurcation with symmetry can be .",
    "we first make a few definitions .",
    "let @xmath362 be a finite subgroup of @xmath363 acting on @xmath61 .",
    "an equation @xmath189 is _ @xmath362-equivariant _ or _ symmetric _",
    "if @xmath364 for a fixed group @xmath362 , we wish to study generic bifurcation within the class of @xmath362-equivariant vector fields .",
    "we now make two assumptions on the group action .",
    "the first is that the action of @xmath362 is absolutely irreducible .",
    "this means that the only matrices which commute with @xmath362 are scalar multiples of the identity .",
    "the second is that the action of @xmath362 is fixed point free : the only point fixed by @xmath362 is the origin .",
    "these assumptions have two consequences for @xmath362-equivariant vector fields .",
    "the first is that the origin is always an equilibrium point of a @xmath362-equivariant vector field , since @xmath365 the second consequence is that the linearization at the origin is a multiple of the identity .",
    "this follows from the calculations : @xmath366 because @xmath367 commutes with all @xmath368 and @xmath362 is absolutely irreducible , @xmath367 must be a scalar multiple of the identity .",
    "we may now state the following :    let @xmath362 be fixed point free and absolutely irreducible and let @xmath361 be a one - parameter family of @xmath362-equivariant vector fields . if the origin undergoes a bifurcation with one zero eigenvalue for @xmath369 , then the linearization at the origin is given by @xmath370 .",
    "in other words , all the eigenvalues must pass through zero simultaneously .",
    "this degenerate linearization occurs as a codimension one phenomenon due to the symmetry of the problem .",
    "we wish to analyze the bifurcations at the origin , but the possibilities are not clear and there are still many restrictions due to the equivariance .    to study the bifurcation in an analogous fashion as for the non - symmetric case , we will compute a normal form by computing a taylor series at the origin : @xmath371 each @xmath372 is a homogeneous , degree @xmath373 , @xmath362-equivariant .",
    "the @xmath372 are not always easy to calculate and we are led to the study of polynomial invariants and equivariants which combines elements of combinatorial theory and modern commutative algebra  @xcite , but we shall not delve into this topic in this paper",
    ".    we shall now study a simple example : @xmath374 acting on @xmath375 , which may be thought of as the symmetry of the square in the plane .",
    "generators for this action are given by @xmath376 and it is easy to show that this action is fixed point free and absolutely irreducible .",
    "we look at the degree three power series expansion at the origin : @xmath377 as @xmath62 passes through 0 , the origin changes stability , but what else happens in the process ?",
    "we can get some additional information from looking at subgroups of @xmath362 and fixed point subspaces .    if @xmath378 , then we define the fixed point subspace of the subgroup @xmath379 by @xmath380 fixed point subspace are important because they are invariant under the flow .",
    "this is easy to see because if @xmath381 , then @xmath382 so @xmath383 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the vector field on @xmath384 is tangent to @xmath384 .",
    "the fixed point subspaces for the example are the axes of symmetry plus the trivial ones : the origin and all of @xmath375 .",
    "to explain bifurcation in some of the fixed point subspaces , cicogna and vanderbauwhede formulated the following lemma :    ( the fixed point branching lemma ) @xcite if @xmath320 is a one - dimensional fixed point subspace , then there is a branch of solutions in @xmath320 in @xmath385 that pass through @xmath386 and is part of a generic bifurcation .",
    "for the @xmath374 example , this means that on the axes of symmetry there are pitchfork bifurcations . for this simple problem",
    ", we may verify this result by explicitly computing the equilibrium points which are given by : @xmath387 @xmath388 @xmath389",
    "so if @xmath213 and @xmath390 , then as @xmath62 passes through zero , eight new equilibrium points are created .",
    "it is typical behavior to get multiple equilibrium points in equivariant bifurcations and a substantial theory has been developed by m. field @xcite , m. golubitsky @xcite and others .",
    "this work , based on group theory and singularity theory , can give information about bifurcation to equilibrium points , period orbits and quasiperiodic orbits .",
    "however , this is a far from complete categorization of the behavior which may be obtained from more complicated group actions .",
    "now consider the action of a group @xmath362 on @xmath51 generated by @xmath391 the action is fixed point free , absolutely irreducible and , a few short calculations show , the degree three equivariant vector field has the form : @xmath392 one of the consequences of the symmetry is the invariance of both the coordinate axes and the coordinate planes .",
    "guckenheimer and holmes @xcite observed that this system of equations has structurally stable heteroclinic cycles for open regions of the parameter space .    if either @xmath393 or @xmath394 and @xmath395 then equations  [ gh ] have attracting heteroclinic cycles for @xmath396 and a globally attracting equilibrium at the origin for @xmath397 .",
    "this theorem essentially follows from examining the flow in the invariant coordinate planes .",
    "the consequence is that within families of @xmath362-equivariant vector fields there are generic one parameter bifurcations from an attracting equilibrium point to structurally stable attracting limit cycles .",

    "structurally stable objects give persistent post bifurcation behavior for @xmath398-equivariant families .",
    "all indications imply that this system has no chaotic behavior , but consider @xmath408 , the elements of the group @xmath362 which are orientation preserving .",

    "this leads to the conclusion that the flow on the invariant sphere can contain chaotic attractors .",
    "all hyperbolic invariant sets are possible post bifurcation behavior , hence we can expect to bifurcate directly from a trivial equilibrium to a chaotic attractor of small amplitude .",
