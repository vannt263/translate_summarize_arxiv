    "in the recent past there has been a growing interest in boundary - layer flow on a continuous moving surface in the presence of magnetic field with or without considering the effect of hall current .",
    "but , of course these are very significant type of flow towards the several engineering applications , such as in polymer processing , electro - chemistry , mhd power generators , flight magnetohydrodynamics as well as in the field of planetary magnetosphere , aeronautics and chemical engineering .",
    "+ sakiadis @xcite first explored the study of boundary - layer flow on a continuous moving surface and crane @xcite extended this problem to a stretching sheet whose surface velocity varies linearly with the distance @xmath0 from a fixed origin . during the past",
    "decades several investigators [ 3 - 10 ] have considered the boundary - layer flow problems under different physical situations .",
    "gupta and gupta @xcite examined the heat and mass transfer over a stretching sheet subject to suction or blowing .",
    "the influence of a uniform magnetic field on the flow of an electrically conducting fluid past a stretching sheet was investigated by pavlov @xcite , andersson @xcite , andersson et al.@xcite , gupta and chakrabarty @xcite , char @xcite , watanabe and pop @xcite and elbashbeshy @xcite .",
    "the chemical reaction on free - convective flow and mass transfer of a viscous , incompressible and electrically conducting fluid over a stretching sheet was investigated by afify @xcite in the presence of a uniform transfer magnetic field . in all these investigations",
    "the electrical conductivity of the fluid was assumed to be uniform and low magnetic field intensity .",
    "however , in an ionized fluid where the density is low and thereby magnetic field intensity is very strong , the conductivity normal to the magnetic field is reduced due to the spiraling of electrons and ions about the magnetic lines of force before collisions take place and a current induced in a direction normal to both the electric and magnetic fields .",
    "this phenomena is known as hall effect .",
    "watanabe and pop @xcite investigated the magnetohydrodynamic boundary - layer flow over a continuously moving semi - infinite flat plate by taking into account the hall currents .",
    "aboeldahab @xcite and aboeldahab and elbarbary @xcite studied the hall current effects on mhd free - convective flow past a vertical plate with mass transfer .",

    "the effect of hall currents on the steady mhd flow of berger s fluid between two parallel electrically insulating infinite planes was carried out by rana et al .",
    "+ recently , a new idea is added to the study of boundary - layer fluid flow and heat transfer is the consideration of the effect of thermal radiation and temperature dependent viscosity .",
    "many processes in engineering applications occur at high temperatures and the radiate heat transfer becomes very important for the design of the pertinent equipment . in view of this , rapits and perdikis @xcite and rapits @xcite studied respectively the flow of a visco - elastic fluid and micropolar fluid past a stretching sheet in the presence of thermal radiation .",

    "@xcite investigated the problem of mhd boundary - layer flow over a heated stretching sheet with variable viscosity . the radiation effect on boundary - layer flow with or without applying magnetic field under different situations",

    "thus the present study fills the gap in this directions .",
    "+ again , combined heat and mass transfer problems with chemical reaction are of increasing importance in many processes , like drying , evaporation at the surface of a water body , energy transfer in a wet cooling tower etc .",
    "in this context , muthucumarswamy and ganesan @xcite studied the effect of the chemical reaction and injection as well as flow characteristics in an unsteady upward motion of an isothermal plate .",
    "chamakha @xcite carried out the mhd flow of uniformly stretching vertical permeable surface in the presence of heat generation / absorption along with the chemical reaction .",

    "@xcite analyzed the effects of chemical reaction , radiation and variable viscosity on hydromagnetic mixed convection heat and mass transfer .",
    "in all these studies ignores the effect of the consideration of hall current .",
    "+ now we propose to study the combined effects of thermal radiation and hall current on the hydromagnetic free - convective flow and mass transfer over a stretching surface with variable viscosity in the presence of heat generation / absorption .",
    "the present problem pertains to situation in which the n - th order chemical reaction takes place .",
    "thus the study is also applicable to the elongation of the bubbles and in bioengineering where the flexible surfaces of the biological cells and membranes in living systems are typically surrounded with fluids which are electrically conducting and being stretched constantly .",
    "we consider the steady free - convective flow and mass transfer of an incompressible , viscous and electrically conducting fluid past a stretching sheet and the sheet is stretched with a velocity proportional to the distance from a fixed origin o ( cf .",

    "the results presented in fig .",
    "22 shows that the dimensionless temperature decreases as the prandatl number @xmath101 increases .",

    "it is clear that an increase in the heat generation / absorption parameter @xmath96 leads to a decrease of @xmath111 .",

    "26 and 27 that under the action of a strong magnetic field , the concentration species has an enhancing effect , whereas it has the reducing effect on the hall current parameter @xmath98 .",
    "the reason behind this is that in equations ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) , the parameters @xmath97 and @xmath98 are connected by the relations of the form @xmath112 and @xmath113 . as the variation of concentration profiles for different values of the parameters @xmath102 and @xmath103 agrees with the temperature profiles , we do not have presented those results .",

    "it is also noticed that the increasing of the parameters @xmath103 , @xmath24 and @xmath106 is to reduce the heat transfer rate and which shows that the rate of change of heat transfer is insignificant .",
    "the rate of mass transfer increases significantly when the hall parameter @xmath98 , the chemical reaction parameter @xmath24 and the schmidt number @xmath106 increases .",
