    "flavour physics has usually been treated as a low - scale effective theory , ignoring high - scale theories , except perhaps for motivating insights from short - distance physics .",
    "it has long been thought by some that high - scale theories with gravity - mediated supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking would typically imply too large flavour - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) contributions .",
    "some people have argued for heavy scalars to suppress the fcncs ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but these are done in the context of the low - scale effective theory , depend on a number of detailed assumptions , and lack deeper motivation .",
    "obtaining detailed flavour predictions from high - scale string theories is difficult because it requires extensive knowledge about the superpotential and the khler potential that is not yet available @xcite .    in recent years",
    "there has been progress in constructing string / m - theories compactified to 4d , with broken susy and moduli stabilized ( as is necessary for any theory to be a candidate to describe our world @xcite ) .",
    "generically such theories have moduli to describe the sizes , shapes , and other properties of the curled up dimensions .",
    "the moduli quanta are unstable and decay via gravitational coupling to all matter .",
    "if they decayed too late , the successes of big bang nucleosynthesis would be spoiled , and/or they would carry too much energy density .",
    "their lifetime depends on their mass , so consistency with cosmology generically requires that they have masses heavier than about 20 tev @xcite .    the importance of this for flavour physics arises because in generic string / m - theories one can show that the gravitino mass , which measures the effects of susy breaking , and to which the soft - breaking lagrangian is proportional , must then itself be heavier than about 20 tev .",
    "then the supergravity theory implies that the scalar superpartner ( squark and slepton ) masses , heavy higgs masses and also the trilinear couplings must all be larger than about 20 tev as well .",
    "that in turn has major effects on flavour physics because the heavy particles and trilinears mainly decouple , though care is needed when the off - diagonal flavour structure is included .",
    "studying these implications is the main goal of this paper .",
    "the results just stated being the generic properties of string / m - theories , if our world is indeed described by a compactified string / m - theory with susy breaking and stabilized moduli ( which is crucial to define the coupling and masses needed for predictions ) , it would be rather likely that the world is described by a theory with heavy scalars and trilinears .    if we specialize to m - theory compactified on a manifold with @xmath1 symmetry , some stronger results hold that may or may not be valid for all string theories . in particular in the m - theory case it has been possible to show that the soft cp - violating phases are zero @xcite , so there is no weak cp problem , and also that the strong cp problem can be solved @xcite . for the @xmath1 compactification ,",
    "once the requirement of a de sitter vacuum and the small cosmological constant are imposed , the gaugino masses are suppressed @xcite .    with this perspective , we investigate limits from flavour and cp violation on the trilinear couplings and soft - squared scalar masses in supersymmetric models with light gluinos and heavy scalars .",
    "some analyses of this kind have been considered previously @xcite , focusing on very particular examples , perhaps with only two heavy families , and ad - hoc assumptions for yukawa and trilinear couplings .",
    "one of the reasons for doing this is that a general analysis represents a formidable task without a priori definite information about the form of the yukawa couplings and the supersymmetric spectrum .",
    "however , for a particular set - up consistent with requirements of compactified string theories , we can make some general statements and obtain precise bounds , even though we do not yet know the precise form of yukawa couplings in the @xmath1-mssm models .",
    "our analysis is organized as follows .    1 .",
    "while we concentrate on the @xmath1-mssm , we analyze three different cases : 1 .",
    "the case where trilinear terms are proportional to yukawa couplings at the unification scale @xmath7 .",
    "such a proportionality is often used in the literature for simplicity .",
    "it arises if we have a trivial khler potential , which respects the @xmath1 holonomy , and yukawa couplings that do not depend on hidden - sector fields . due to the running of the parameters , yukawa and trilinear couplings",
    "are not proportional to each other at low energies .",
    "hence , non - zero off - diagonal elements in the trilinear matrices remain even after diagonalizing the yukawa matrices at the electroweak scale .",
    "the case where trilinear terms are not proportional to yukawa couplings at @xmath7 , but such that the non - proportionality is determined by real factors .",
    "thus , complex phases at high energy enter only via the yukawa couplings .",
    "this should generically happen in the context of the @xmath1-mssm @xcite .",
    "this case can be reproduced with a non - trivial khler potential .",
    "we generate a series of random numbers determining the non - proportionality .",
    "the case where trilinear terms are not proportional to yukawa couplings at @xmath7 and where new phases appear at the high scale .",
    "this will represent a scenario beyond the @xmath1-mssm .",
    "we explore this scenario as a contrast to the @xmath1-mssm case so that we can determine whether or not there could be an important impact of the phases . again",
    ", we use random numbers determining the non - proportionality , which are now complex .",
    "+ we assess the impact of the trilinear terms on flavour and cp violation for each case .",
    "2 .   at @xmath7",
    "the boundary conditions are as follows : the yukawa matrices of both up- and down - type quarks are non - diagonal complex @xmath8 matrices .",
    "their diagonalizing matrices are similar to the ckm matrix @xmath9 , so their off - diagonal elements are small , except for the right - handed diagonalizing matrix of down quarks , @xmath10 , which has sizable off - diagonal elements . for concreteness ,",
    "we use yukawa matrices constructed in a grand unified model with a family symmetry @xcite .",
    "it is important to mention that we have taken this as a definite example but this yukawa pattern can be embedded in other contexts .",
    "the trilinear terms are also non - diagonal complex @xmath8 matrices , either ( a ) proportional or ( b ) not proportional to the yukawa matrices without new phases or ( c ) not proportional to the yukawa matrices with new cp phases .",
    "the soft - squared mass matrices are proportional to the unit matrix at @xmath7 .",
    "recall that whenever we have a trivial khler metric , the soft - squared masses at that scale will be proportional to the unit matrix , because the same matrices diagonalizing the khler metric will diagonalize the soft - squared matrices .",
    "non - trivial khler metrics could also reproduce diagonal soft - squared masses but lift the universality condition . as long as @xmath11 at the gut scale",
    ", the result from this analysis will be valid .",
    "we focus our studies on supersymmetric mass spectra featuring heavy scalars ( @xmath12 ) and light gauginos .",
    "in particular , the light gluino ( @xmath13 ) , due to its strong interactions , can potentially play a significant role for low - energy observables even if the scalars are heavy . for the specification of such susy mass spectra",
    ", we use the @xmath1-mssm @xcite as a concrete uv - complete model , which helps us to clarify the potential effects of the high - energy physics on the flavour physics phenomena at the electroweak scale .",
    "the model is based on the effective field theories arising from a class of @xmath14 fluxless compactifications of m - theory on a @xmath1 manifold . for concreteness",
    ", we choose a set of benchmark @xmath1-mssm spectra that has been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "4 .   in addition to bounds coming mainly from the kaon sector ,",
    "we also consider constraints from the stability of the scalar potential , which are relevant for heavy spectra since they are independent of the mass scale of the supersymmetric particles .    in section [ g2results ] for completeness of this work , we summarize the defining features of @xmath1-mssm models",
    "one goal of this analysis is to set bounds on the trilinear and soft - squared masses .",
    "the general relation in supergravity theories @xcite between trilinear and yukawa couplings is @xmath15   \\notag \\\\ & & { } -\\braket { { \\mathcal{f}}^m } \\left [ \\braket{\\tilde{k}^{\\delta\\bar\\rho } \\ , ( \\partial_m \\tilde k_{\\bar\\rho{\\alpha}})}y_{\\delta { \\beta } { \\gamma } } + ( { \\alpha } \\leftrightarrow { \\beta } ) + ( { \\alpha } \\leftrightarrow { \\gamma } ) \\right ] ,   \\label{eq : acontino}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 with @xmath17 , that is the greek indices help to differentiate among the different chiral superfields of the theory .",
    "greek indices with bar are related to operations on the antichiral superfields , e.g.  @xmath18 . here",
    "@xmath19 denotes the elements of the inverse matrix . besides",
    ", @xmath20 are hidden - sector fields whose @xmath21-term vacuum expectation values break susy , @xmath22 is the part of the khler potential that depends only on these fields , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . after taking the flat limit",
    ", the visible - sector superpotential has to be rescaled as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the superpotential of the hidden sector and @xmath27 is the reduced planck mass .",
    "the primed quantities enter into @xmath28 and the unprimed ones into @xmath29 . for simplicity , we assume a trivial matter khler metric @xmath30 . in this case",
    "the soft - squared scalar masses are proportional to the unit matrix , and the second line in eq .   vanishes .",
    "however , we allow the yukawa couplings to depend non - trivially on @xmath20 . consequently , the second term in eq .",
    "gives a contribution to the trilinears that is not proportional to the yukawa matrix .",
    "in other words , what we explore here is @xmath31 where @xmath32 are family indices , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are unknown numbers determining the non - proportionality .    it has been realized in @xcite that only for @xmath35 and @xmath36 at @xmath7 or at the scale where the boundary conditions of the set - up are given , we can realize at low energies , near the electroweak scale @xmath37 , the minimal flavour violation ( mfv ) condition @xcite .",
    "however , even with large @xmath38 , this does not imply that fcncs can not be under control .",
    "in fact , even in models with a light supersymmetric spectrum , family symmetries are a nice way to control dangerous fcncs olive:2008vv , abel:2001cv , ross:2002mr , ross:2004qn , antusch:2007re , antusch:2008jf , calibbi:2009ja , calibbi:2010rf , kadota:2010cz , antusch:2011sq . for heavy scalar masses , one may expect that supersymmetric effects will mostly decouple , hence ameliorating the susy flavour problem .",
    "for the concrete examples to be discussed in ",
    "[ examplesection ] , for instance , fcncs and cp violation will be suppressed because of the hierarchy between the gaugino and the scalar masses .",
    "however , given the precision of observations especially in the kaon sector , even suppressed susy contributions can be relevant .",
    "the most important indirect tests that most scenarios for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) have to face are the electroweak precision observables , the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , fcncs , and cp violation . for the @xmath1-mssm examples we shall discuss in  [ examplesection ] , for instance ,",
    "the electroweak parameters are worked out in such a way that contributions due to the large values of higgs masses involved in the theory are avoided .",
    "the higgs sector behaves as an effective single doublet , with one light scalar and the other mass eigenstates heavy .    in the fcnc sector",
    "the @xmath39 observables @xmath40 and @xmath41 can indeed give us a hint of ways to restrict boundary conditions of soft terms at @xmath7 . in this section",
    "we discuss the computation of these parameters .",
    "recall that qcd corrections are important for these observables and therefore the different scales involved in the determination of @xmath40 and @xmath41 play an important role . in ",

    "we can always choose to go to the basis where one of the yukawa couplings is diagonal at @xmath7 , but this does not guarantee diagonal soft mass - squared matrices in the sckm basis because the fact that @xmath321 necessarily implies that not all of the matrices @xmath322 and @xmath323 are diagonal .",
    "as it is known @xmath40 is very sensitive to this @xcite .",
    "if the coupling of the particles beyond the sm was of the same order as that of the sm particles , this would push the limit on the scale of new physics entering into the @xmath50 processes up to @xmath324    in the lepton sector , we assume heavy right - handed neutrinos that decouple close to the gut scale .",
    "therefore only the superpartners of right- and left - handed charged leptons as well as left - handed neutrinos can induce flavour violation .",
    "considering the structure of fermion masses we are using , see section [ sbs : hieryukcoups ] and references therein , the yukawa coupling matrix for neutrinos is the same as that for the up - quark sector at @xmath7 , therefore the flavour violation induced in this scenario is relatively small .",
    "table  [ tbl : deltas - eijxy ] shows the mi parameters relevant for the observables @xmath325 .    in the @xmath1-mssm case , where all the examples that are known @xcite correspond to the case that trilinear couplings are proportional to yukawa couplings",
    ", we can have a theory , depending on the choice of yukawa couplings , for which at low energy , all flavour violation present is below the experimental bounds .",
    "it is only in this sense that we can say that we have an _ ultraviolet version of mfv _ but not in the sense in which mfv is defined . for the case of the relation with @xmath192 as in eq .",
    ", that is @xmath326 real random numbers between @xmath327 and @xmath328 , at low energies cp violating phases in addition to the ckm phase appear but also flavour violation is below experimental bounds . with @xmath192 as in eq .  , i.e. , with random numbers between @xmath327 and @xmath328 and explicit cp phases at @xmath7 , flavour violation is more difficult to neglect but still below the experimental bounds .",
    "this means that even with more cp phases than in the sm and large mixing present due to the choice of yukawa couplings , after the running to low energy we obtain a theory which satisfies flavour violation constraints .",
    "not surprisingly , the reason are the large scalar masses .",
    "what is not a trivial result of the analysis is that still bounds on the size of trilinear terms can be obtained .",

    "<S> in recent years it has been learned that scalar superpartner masses and trilinear couplings should _ both _ generically be larger than about 20 tev at the short distance string scale if our world is described by a compactified string or m - theory with supersymmetry breaking and stabilized moduli @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we study implications of this , somewhat generally and also in detail for a particular realization ( compactification of m - theory on a @xmath0 manifold ) where there is significant knowledge of the superpotential and gauge kinetic function , and a light gluino . in a certain sense this yields an ultraviolet completion of minimal flavour violation . </S>",
    "<S> flavour violation stems from off - diagonal and non - universal diagonal elements of scalar mass matrices and trilinear couplings , and from renormalization group running . </S>",
    "<S> we also examine stability bounds on the scalar potential . </S>",
    "<S> while heavy scalars alone do not guarantee the absence of flavour problems , our studies show that models with heavy scalars and light gluinos can be free from such problems .     * flavour issues for string - motivated heavy scalar spectra with a low gluino mass : the @xmath1-mssm case + *    * k.  kadota@xmath2 , g.  kane @xmath3 , j.  kersten@xmath4 , and l.  velasco - sevilla@xmath5 * + _ @xmath3 michigan center for theoretical physics , university of michigan , + ann arbor , mi , 48104 , usa + @xmath6 department of physics , nagoya university , nagoya 464 - 8602 , japan + @xmath4 university of hamburg , ii .  </S>",
