    "the purpose of this note is to establish the following theorem :    [ main ] let @xmath0 be a finite collection of sets .",
    "then we have @xmath18 where @xmath7 denotes the cardinality of @xmath0 , @xmath3 denotes the assertion that @xmath12 is the disjoint union of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , the exponent @xmath10 can not be replaced by any larger quantity .",
    "note that @xmath9 .",
    "thus the inequality improves upon the trivial bound @xmath19 that arises simply because there are @xmath11 pairs @xmath20 , and this pair uniquely determines @xmath12 .",
    "theorem [ main ] has applications in analyzing the running time of several dynamic programming algorithms used in phylogenetic reconstruction literature .",
    "several published algorithms @xcite seek to find a median tree that minimizes the total distance to an input set of trees , for various definitions of a distance between two trees .",
    "for example , a method called astral @xcite defines the distance between two trees as the number of quartet trees induced by one tree but not the other , and seeks to find the unrooted tree that minimizes the sum of this quartet distance to its input set of unrooted trees , a problem that turns out to be np - hard @xcite . to make this optimization problem tractable , astral uses a dynamic programming approach where the final tree is built by successively dividing each subset of leaves ( called a cluster ) @xmath12 into smaller clusters , @xmath21 and @xmath22 while minimizing the number of quartets in the input tree set that will have to be missing from any tree that includes @xmath23 as a bipartition ( i.e. , a branch ; note that a branch in an unrooted tree is just a bipartition of the leaves ) .",
    "if in dividing @xmath12 to two subsets all possible subsets @xmath24 are considered , the algorithm provably returns the optimal tree ( also , the optimal solution has been shown to enjoy statistical consistency under certain models of gene and species evolution @xcite ) .",
    "however , such a dynamic programming algorithm will have to explore the power set of the set of leaves and will thus require time exponential in the number of leaves .    to give a practical alternative , astral solves a constrained version of the problem where a set @xmath0 of clusters is defined in advance to constrain the search space ; when dividing @xmath12 , we only look for @xmath24 such that @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the set @xmath0 is defined heuristically , and the running time of astral should be defined asymptotically as a function of @xmath7 . throughout the dynamic programming execution ,",
    "astral considers all possible pairs of clusters @xmath27 exactly once iff @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , establishing the asymptotic running time of astral with regards to @xmath7 requires bounding the left - hand side of astral simply used the trivial @xmath30 upper bound in their running time analysis .",
    "we can now improve that analysis to @xmath31 .",
    "we first demonstrate why the exponent @xmath10 is best possible .",
    "let @xmath32 be a large multiple of @xmath33 , and let @xmath0 denote the collection of all sets @xmath34 whose cardinality @xmath35 is equal to either @xmath36 or @xmath37 .",
    "clearly @xmath38 on the other hand , if @xmath1 has cardinality @xmath37 , then it can be partitioned in @xmath39 ways into @xmath40 with @xmath41 , and no partition is available when @xmath12 has cardinality @xmath36 .",
    "thus the left - hand side of is equal to @xmath42 using the stirling approximation @xmath43 as @xmath44 , we conclude that the left - hand side of is equal to @xmath45 , while the right - hand side is equal to @xmath46 , and on sending @xmath44 we conclude that can fail when @xmath47 .",
    "now we show why holds for @xmath48",
    ". this will be a consequence of the following convolution estimate on the discrete unit cube @xmath13 :    [ conv ] let @xmath49 be a natural number , and let @xmath50 be functions .",
    "set @xmath51 .",
    "then we have @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the top right corner of @xmath13 , @xmath54 denotes the convolution @xmath55 and @xmath56 denotes the @xmath57 norm @xmath58    let us now see why theorem [ conv ] implies theorem [ main ] .",
    "we first observe that to prove theorem [ main ] , it suffices to do so under the additional assumption that all the sets in @xmath0 are finite .",
    "indeed , if we let @xmath59 denote the union of the sets in @xmath0 , then @xmath0 partitions @xmath60 into at most @xmath61 cells . some of these cells may be infinite , but we may replace any such cell with a single point without affecting either the left or right - hand side of .",
    "after applying this replacement , every set in @xmath0 is now finite .    without loss of generality",
    ", we may now assume that all the sets @xmath12 in @xmath0 are subsets of @xmath62 for some natural number @xmath49 .",
    "we now define the functions @xmath63 as follows . for any @xmath64 , we set @xmath65 when the set @xmath66 lies in @xmath0 , and @xmath67 otherwise .",
    "similarly , we set @xmath68 when the set @xmath69 lies in @xmath0 , and @xmath70 otherwise .",
    "it is then easy to see that @xmath71 and @xmath72 giving the claim .",
    "young s convolution inequality establishes with @xmath10 replaced by @xmath73 ( or any exponent less than @xmath73 ) .",
    "this corresponds to the trivial bound .",
    "the ability to improve the exponents in young s convolution inequality is reminiscent of the kunze - stein phenomenon @xcite in semisimple lie groups , as well as the hypercontractivity inequality on the boolean cube ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the proof of theorem [ conv ] will be similar to the proof of hypercontractivity in that we will soon reduce matters to verifying the one - dimensional case @xmath74 .",
    "the above argument in fact establishes the more general inequality @xmath75 whenever @xmath76 are finite collections of sets .",
    "the form of theorem [ conv ] is very amenable to an induction on dimension :    let @xmath77 be natural numbers .",
    "if theorem [ conv ] holds for @xmath78 and @xmath79 , then it holds for @xmath80 .",
    "let @xmath81 be functions .",
    "for any @xmath82 , let @xmath83 denote the function @xmath84 for @xmath85 ( where we identify the pair @xmath86 with an element of @xmath87 in the usual fashion ) .",
    "then we can write @xmath88 applying theorem [ conv ] for @xmath79 and the functions @xmath89 , we thus have @xmath90 applying theorem [ conv ] for @xmath78 and the functions @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , we obtain @xmath94 which gives theorem [ conv ] for @xmath80 .    from this proposition and induction , we see that to prove theorem [ conv ] , it suffices to do so in the one - dimensional case @xmath74 . we may normalize @xmath95 so that we may write @xmath96 for some @xmath97 .",
    "the inequality then simplifies to the elementary inequality @xmath98 observe that equality is attained here when @xmath99 ; the final case @xmath100 also reveals that the inequality fails if @xmath10 is replaced by any quantity larger than @xmath101 .",
    "this is of course consistent with the second part of theorem [ main ] .",
    "the fact that equality is attained in in four different locations seems to rule out any quick proof of using convexity - based methods such as jensen s inequality .",
    "instead , we argue as follows . first observe that when @xmath102 , the left - hand side of simplifies to @xmath103 , and it is then clear that the inequality holds whenever @xmath102 and is strict unless @xmath104 .",
    "next , we analyze the left - hand side of for @xmath105 close to @xmath106 . writing @xmath107 for some small @xmath108 , we can write this expression as @xmath109 for @xmath110 small enough , we have @xmath111 ( say ) , which by the concavity of @xmath112 implies that @xmath113 on the other hand , from the arithmetic mean - geometric mean inequality we certainly have @xmath114 since @xmath115 , we conclude that the inequality holds whenever @xmath116 is sufficiently small , or equivalently when @xmath105 is sufficiently close to @xmath106 . from continuity we now see that holds whenever @xmath117 is sufficiently small , and similarly for @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "thus we may assume @xmath120 for some small absolute constant @xmath121 .",
    "we next consider the boundary case @xmath122 , @xmath123 . here , we claim strict inequality : @xmath124 but from the cauchy - schwarz inequality one has @xmath125 and the claim follows since @xmath126 .",
    "for similar reasons , we obtain strict inequality in when @xmath127 or @xmath128 . by continuity , this establishes in all regions except the region @xmath129 for some small absolute constant @xmath121 .",
    "we now work in this region .",
    "we can rewrite as @xmath130 writing @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 lies in the region @xmath135 and the above inequality transforms to @xmath136 or equivalently @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the function @xmath139 .    since the region is compact , and the inequality",
    "is already known on the boundary of this region , it suffices to verify when @xmath140 is a critical point of the left - hand side , that is to say that @xmath141 since @xmath142 , we can rewrite this condition as @xmath143 the function @xmath144 is increasing for @xmath145 and decreasing for @xmath146 , so it can not attain the same value three times . from",
    "we conclude that at least two of @xmath134 are equal . without loss of generality",
    "we may assume @xmath147 , then from we have @xmath148 and @xmath149 and hence @xmath150 dividing by @xmath151 we obtain @xmath152 and then setting @xmath153 we conclude that @xmath154 the function @xmath155 is convex , equals @xmath156 when @xmath157 , @xmath158 when @xmath159 , and is larger than @xmath160 for sufficiently large @xmath160 .",
    "as a consequence , the equation has exactly two solutions , one at @xmath157 and one with @xmath161 ; see figure [ power - fig ] .",
    "the second solution can be computed numerically as @xmath162 .",
    "thus , there are two critical points @xmath140 with @xmath147 , the first of which is @xmath163 and the second of which can be computed numerically as @xmath164 at the first critical point , we have @xmath165 , and one easily verifies that the left - hand side of vanishes since @xmath166 . at the second critical point , one can numerically verify that @xmath167 and hence @xmath168 at this critical point , giving the claim .",

    "recall from @xcite that the _ additive energy _ @xmath174 of a finite subset @xmath12 of an additive group @xmath175 is defined as the number of quadruples @xmath176 such that @xmath16 .",
    "we have the trivial bound @xmath177 , which is attained for instance when @xmath12 is itself a finite group . by modifying the above arguments",

    "the second claim is clear , since if @xmath182 then one easily computes that @xmath183 and @xmath184 . as in the previous section ,",

    "the left - hand side is @xmath191 and the right - hand side is at least @xmath192 , so the claim holds for @xmath151 sufficiently close to zero . at @xmath193 ,",
    "the function @xmath194 takes the value of @xmath195 , first derivative of @xmath196 , and second derivative of @xmath197 while @xmath198 takes the value of @xmath199 , first derivative of @xmath200 , and second derivative of @xmath201 so the claim also holds for @xmath151 sufficiently close to @xmath202 .",
