    "in recent years there has been considerable interest on the part of theorists and experimentalists in the study of macroscopic properties of inhomogeneous solids . a special , but very widespread case of an inhomogeneous solid medium is a polycrystal whose inhomogeneity is due to the misorientation of discrete single crystal grains .",
    "since polycrystals are the usual state of crystalline media , the calculation of their properties is an actual problem .",
    "macroscopic properties of polycrystalline solids can be described in the framework of different models of an effective isotropic medium .",
    "the problem is to calculate characteristics of such an isotropic medium when the corresponding parameters of single crystalline grains are known .",
    "for example , let @xmath0 @xmath1 be the principal values of the single crystal static conductivity tensor . by proceeding from this information",
    "we would like to calculate the scalar effective conductivity @xmath2 of the polycrystal .    in our opinion",
    "the most accurate and physically meaningful method of calculation of an effective characteristic of a polycrystal goes back to the pioneering works of i.m.lifshitz et al @xcite . in the framework of this method",
    "it is assumed that the polycrystalline medium can be described as an effective isotropic medium that is perturbed by random spatial fluctuations caused by the orientational fluctuations of the grains . generally , an effective characteristic of a polycrystal is not a function of its value in the single crystal only ( in our example @xmath2 is not a function of @xmath0 only ) , but depends on the geometric statistics of the grains , reflecting directly the macroscopic properties of the medium they compose .",
    "the statistical properties of the medium are described by the multipoint correlators of the characteristic .",
    "these correlators , in turn , depend on the shape , the mutual location , and the misorientation of crystallographic axes of constituent single crystal grains .    for the sake of being definite , let s assume that @xmath3 is any tensor macroscopic characteristic of a polycrystal .",
    "let @xmath4 be a vector field .",
    "we have equations , which are associated with this field , and the characteristic @xmath3 is a coefficient of these equations ( for example , if @xmath3 is the conductivity tensor , @xmath4 is the electromagnetic field and the differential equations are maxwell s equations ) .",
    "let us be interested in the calculation of the field @xmath5 , which is the field @xmath4 averaged over realizations of the polycrystalline structure .",
    "let s measure the elements of the tensor @xmath3 in the laboratory coordinate system .",
    "in each single crystal grain their values depend on the orientation of the crystallographic axes of this particular grain with respect to the laboratory axes .",
    "thus , in the polycrystal the elements of the tensor @xmath3 are functions of position @xmath6 in the medium . if the crystallographic axes of the grains are rotated randomly with respect to each other , @xmath7 is a stochastic tensor .",
    "our problem is to define the effective characteristic of the medium @xmath8 , which provides the correct value of the averaged field @xmath5 .    in the general case ,",
    "when calculating @xmath8 , the geometric statistics of the grains ( the spatial fluctuations of @xmath7 ) can be taken into account accurately only under the assumption of small anisotropy of the characteristic @xmath3 in the original single crystal .",
    "let @xmath9 be the tensor @xmath3 , whose elements are averaged over all possible orientations of crystallites .",
    "if the spatial fluctuations @xmath10 are small , the perturbation theory is applicable .",
    "the zero order term of the perturbation series gives @xmath11 .",
    "the general way providing the correct result for @xmath8 with regard to its spatial fluctuations was given in @xcite . according to these papers ,",
    "the starting point of the calculation is the derivation of the equations for the averaged field @xmath12 . to this end",
    "we present the field @xmath4 as a sum of the averaged field and a stochastic addition @xmath13 .",
    "averaging the exact stochastic equations and calculating the stochastic field @xmath13 considering the averaged field @xmath12 as known , we obtain a system of closed equations for the averaged field . by proceeding from these equations the value @xmath8",
    "can be defined and calculated .",
    "the correction to @xmath9 can be obtained as an expansion in correlators @xmath14 , @xmath15 and so on ; angular brackets @xmath16 denote an average over the ensemble of realizations of the polycrystalline structure ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . these correlators can be calculated for a model polycrystal , or they are assumed to be known characteristics of the medium . only rarely the series of the correlators can be summed .",
    "that is the reason why , in the general case , the problem of calculation of effective polycrystal characteristics has not been solved yet .",
    "we would like to note that the procedure described above , involves the calculation of random fields @xmath17 .",
    "consequently , the calculation of effective characteristics of an unbounded polycrystal is simpler than the calculation of effective characteristics related to phenomena , where the sample surface must be taken into account . in the former case",
    "the problem is reduced to an algebraic problem , while in the latter one an integral equation must be solved ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "the calculation of the effective surface impedance of a weakly anisotropic metal polycrystals carried out in the framework of perturbation theory was presented in @xcite .",
    "the exact solutions , which allow to consider polycrystals with strong anisotropy can be found very rarely .",
    "one of such examples is the calculation of the effective static conductivity of a two - dimensional isotropic polycrystal , where , due to a specific symmetry transformation allowed by the equations of the problem , the exact result has been obtained for arbitrary values of two principal conductivities @xcite .",
    "it must be pointed out that this result does not depend on the geometric statistics of the grains ( on the correlators of the conductivity in different points of the polycrystal ) .",
    "the other example is quite a new result for the effective surface impedance of a polycrystalline metal associated with the reflection of an averaged electromagnetic wave @xcite .",
    "it is valid in the frequency region of the impedance ( the leontovich ) boundary conditions applicability @xcite , i.e. when the penetration depth of electromagnetic field into a metal @xmath18 is much less than a characteristic length @xmath19 related to the surface inhomogeneity . in the case of a polycrystalline metal with the flat surface , @xmath19 is of the order of the mean size of a grain .",
    "this result is a nonperturbative one with respect to the inhomogeneity amplitude .",
    "it is exact up to the limits of the impedance boundary conditions applicability , i.e. up to the terms of the order of @xmath20 .",
    "although under the conditions of strong skin effect ( @xmath21 ) the electromagnetic problem seems to resemble a two - dimensional problem , the structure and the reason of the exact result @xcite existence are different from the ones in the two - dimensional static problem .",
    "e.l.feinberg obtained a similar result while calculating the effective dielectric constant for radio waves propagating along the earth surface @xcite .",
    "we would like to mention that the same approach to the effective surface impedance calculation can be used when the surface inhomogeneity is due to the surface roughness @xcite .",
    "the method of the effective impedance calculation , proposed in @xcite , is suitable both for the conditions of normal and anomalous skin effect .",
    "the conditions of normal skin - effect correspond to the low frequency region when @xmath22 . here",
    "@xmath23 is the electron mean free path , @xmath24 is the frequency of the incident wave , @xmath25 is the electron relaxation time . in this limiting case",
    "the relation between the current density @xmath26 and the electric field strength @xmath27 is local , and the conductivity tensor is an ordinary tensor ( a multiplying operator ) . for an isotropic metal with a scalar conductivity @xmath28 under the conditions of normal skin effect @xmath29 .    in sufficiently clean metals",
    ", skin effect clearly shows an anomalous character when the temperature is low and the electron mean free path @xmath23 exceeds the penetration depth @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , over a wide range of frequencies of radio waves the condition @xmath30 is easily fulfilled .",
    "this is the range of extremely anomalous skin effect . at the same time",
    ", the frequency @xmath24 can be much less than @xmath31 . everywhere in what follows",
    "we assume that both the inequalities ( @xmath30 and @xmath32 ) are fulfilled .",
    "we would like to emphasize that these conditions are not burdensome : when the temperature is low , as a rule , anomalous skin effect takes place for radio waves whose wavelengths range in value from centimeters to many meters .",
    "it is easy to verify that the inequalities @xmath30 and @xmath32 are consistent if @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the electronic plasma frequency , given by @xmath35 ; @xmath36 is the electron number density , @xmath37 is the magnitude of the electronic charge , and @xmath38 is the effective mass of the charge carriers .",
    "consequently , the electron mean free path @xmath23 must exceed the plasma penetration depth @xmath39 .",
    "this inequality must be taken into account when the relation between @xmath23 and the mean size of a grain @xmath19 is discussed ( see below ) .    under the conditions of anomalous skin effect",
    "the relation between the current @xmath26 and the electric field strength @xmath27 is non - local . in this case , maxwell s equations turn into the system of integro - differential equations .",
    "let s note that in the papers of i.m.lifshitz et al @xcite , as well as in the following studies , the calculation of effective characteristics of polycrystals was based on the solution of differential equations with stochastic coefficients .",
    "the study of anomalous skin effect in polycrystals appears to be the first example of an analysis of stochastic integro - differential equations with regard to the theory of polycrystals .",
    "one of distinctive features of anomalous skin effect is the possibility to pass to the limit @xmath40 .",
    "in particular this means that under the conditions of anomalous skin effect , the impedance does not depend on temperature @xcite .",
    "the impedance is a macroscopic characteristic of the metal surface sensitive to the orientation of the crystal surface with respect to its crystallographic axes . in other words",
    ", it depends on the vector @xmath41 , which is the unit vector directed along the normal to the metal surface .",
    "next , under the conditions of normal skin effect the value of the impedance of a crystal is defined by the conductivity tensor ; under the conditions of anomalous skin effect it depends on the geometry of the fermi surface of the metal .",
    "the difference becomes especially evident in the case of cubic crystals .",
    "when calculating the conductivity , a cubic crystal is the same as an isotropic solid : the conductivity tensor degenerates into a scalar . then under the conditions of normal skin effect",
    "the impedance of a cubic crystal does not depend on @xmath41 . moreover",
    ", the impedance does not depend on the structure of the sample : it is the same for crystal and polycrystal samples . but",
    "the fermi surfaces of cubic crystals are rather complex .",
    "consequently , under the conditions of anomalus skin effect the impedance of a cubic crystal is a complex function of @xmath41 defined by the structure of the fermi surface .    in @xcite",
    "the effective impedance of various strongly anisotropic polycrystalline media has been calculated under the conditions of normal skin effect .",
    "in the same works , under the conditions of anomalous skin , effect only polycrystals composed of single crystal grains whose fermi surfaces were uniaxial ellipsoids were studied . in the present publication",
    "we have to find out whether the effective impedance of polycrystals under the conditions of anomalous skin effect depends on the geometry of the fermi surface .",
    "it is well known that the fermi surfaces of real metals are extremely complex and differ significantly for different metals @xcite .",
    "let @xmath42 be the equation of the fermi surface : @xmath43 is the fermi energy , @xmath44 is the fermi electron momentum ( or rather , its quasi - momentum ) .",
    "the fermi surface is periodic in @xmath45 . in certain metals",
    "it breaks up into individual identical surfaces , each of which is situated in its respective cell of the reciprocal lattice .",
    "such fermi surfaces are called _ closed _ fermi surfaces .",
    "the ellipsoidal fermi surface , discussed in @xcite , is an example of a closed fermi surface .",
    "in other metals the fermi surfaces are _ open _ , passing through the whole momentum space .",
    "due to the degeneracy ( the temperature @xmath46 ) only electrons whose energy is equal to @xmath43 take part in the metal conductivity .",
    "they are the electrons on the fermi surface . under the conditions of extremely anomalous skin effect the inequality @xmath30 , or @xmath47 ( @xmath48 is the electromagnetic field wave vector ) , selects electrons from `` the belt '' @xmath49 ; @xmath50 is the velocity of the electron on the fermi surface .",
    "other electrons are ineffective @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , when calculating the impedance of a polycrystal , an averaging over the direction of @xmath41 has to be done ( see below ) . when the direction of the normal to the metal surface changes , `` the belt '' moves along the fermi surface .",
    "thus , the impedance of the polycrystal is defined by all the electrons from the fermi surface even under the conditions of extremely anomalous skin effect .",
    "the averaging leads to an isotropization .",
    "it is usual to think of an isotropic metal as of a metal with the shperical fermi surface .",
    "the question is , if this evidently model assumption is correct for the description of anomalous skin effect in polycrystals .",
    "our results show that being a characteristic of a medium which is isotropic on the average , the effective impedance of a polycrystal composed of single crystal grains with complex fermi surface depends on the details of the geometry of the fermi surface .    as it is shown below",
    ", the calculation of the effective impedance of polycrystals involves two steps .",
    "the first step is the calculation of the impedance of the crystal metal for an arbitrary orientation of the crystallographic axes with respect to the metal surface .",
    "and the second step is the averaging over all possible orientations of the crystallographic axes .",
    "the first step requires the definition of electrons providing the maximal contribution to the conductivity when @xmath47 .",
    "it is well known , the more the conductivity , the less the impedance .",
    "the second step ( the averaging ) selects the calculated impedances choosing the maximal .",
    "thus , the required impedance is the result of the solution of a nontrivial mini - max problem .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite in section ii we present the algorithm of the effective surface impedance calculation suitable in the case of strongly anisotropic polycrystals . in section",
    "iii the applicability of this approach to polycrystals under the conditions of anomalous skin effect is discussed .",
    "based on the results of section ii , we obtain the general expression for the effective impedance of a polycrystal metal composed of single crystal grains with a complex dispersion relation of conduction electrons , i.e. with a complex fermi surface . in the case of fermi surfaces which are arbitrary surfaces of revolution ,",
    "the result is presented in the form which allows analytical analyses of the influence of the shape of the fermi surface on the effective impedance value . in section",
    "iv we use the obtained formulae to calculate the effective impedance for polycrystals composed of the grains with different model fermi surfaces . in section",
    "v we investigate the effect of the change of the topology of the fermi surface on the value of the effective impedance of polycrystals and present two examples of its behavior in the vicinity of the electronic topological transition .",
    "it is well known that to solve an electrodynamic problem external with respect to the metal , it is sufficient to know the tangential components of the electric @xmath27 and magnetic @xmath51 vectors at the metal surface @xcite . only the relation between @xmath52 and @xmath53 depends on the metal properties : @xmath54 ,     \\eqno ( 1)\\ ] ] the subscript `` t '' denotes the tangential components of the vectors .",
    "the two - dimensional tensor @xmath55 is the surface impedance tensor of the metal .",
    "its real and imaginary parts define respectively the absorption of an incident wave and the phase shift of the reflected wave .    because of a very high conductivity the character of the reflection of an electromagnetic wave from a metal surface",
    "practically does not depend on the shape of the incident field , in particular , on the angle of incidence .",
    "then , to calculate the surface impedance , it is sufficient to investigate normal incidence of an electromagnetic wave onto the metal half - space .",
    "the explicit form of the elements of @xmath56 depends on the frequency of the incident wave @xmath24 as well as on the metal characteristics @xcite . in the order of magnitude @xmath57 ; @xmath58 is the vacuum wave length , @xmath59 .",
    "when the tensor @xmath56 is known , eqs.(1 ) play the role of boundary conditions for the electromagnetic fields in the region outside the metal .",
    "if a metal surface is an inhomogeneous one , and skin effect is strong , i.e. @xmath60 ( @xmath19 is the characteristic size of the inhomogeneity ) , eqs.(1 ) are local up to the terms of the order of @xmath20 . in other words , in eqs.(1 ) @xmath56 is an ordinary multiplying operator , but the elements of @xmath56 depend on position at the surface . in this case eqs.(1 ) are called the local leontovich ( impedance ) boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "then to solve an external electrodynamic problem it is necessary to know the surface impedance tensor at every point of the metal surface .",
    "when the surface inhomogeneity is strong , the solution requires cumbersome numerical calculations .",
    "sometimes it is sufficient to know the reflected electromagnetic wave averaged over the surface inhomogeneities . the general way providing the correct result is to derive equations for the averaged electromagnetic fields both in the metal half - space and in the medium over the metal ( we assume it to be vacuum ) , as well as the boundary conditions for these fields at the metal - vacuum interface . by proceeding from these equations",
    "we obtain the relation between the tangential components of the averaged electric and magnetic vectors at the metal surface and , consequently , the effective impedance tensor @xmath61 .",
    "just this calculation procedure has been outlined in introduction .",
    "but when @xmath21 the problem is simplified because we can examine the fields in the vacuum side of the system only .",
    "since in the vacuum maxwell s equations do not contain any inhomogeneous parameters , the averaging of these equations gives the standard set of maxwell s equations .",
    "therefore the main problem is to obtain the boundary conditions for the averaged fields from the exact eqs.(1 ) .",
    "this can be done without the direct solution of the complete electrodynamic problem .",
    "the conception of the effective surface impedance is valid if the characteristic size of the surface inhomogeneity @xmath19 is small compared with the vacuum wave length @xmath62 .",
    "since the stochastic fields are damped out at a distance of the order of @xmath19 from the metal surface , beginning with a distances @xmath63 , @xmath64 , the total electromagnetic field equals to its averaged value .",
    "then the problem is reduced to the calculation of the electromagnetic fields reflected from the flat surface whose surface impedance is @xmath61 .    for polycrystals , the surface inhomogeneity is due to the misorientaion of the crystallographic axes of the grains at the metal surface , and the characteristic length @xmath19 is of the order of the mean size of a grain . in what follows",
    "we assume that @xmath65    let an electromagnetic wave be incident normally from the vacuum onto the planar surface @xmath66 of a polycrystalline metal which occupies the region @xmath67 . by analogy with eq.(1 ) , we define the effective surface impedance tensor by the equation @xmath68 ,     \\eqno ( 3)\\ ] ] where @xmath69 coincides with @xmath70 ; @xmath70 is the unit vector directed along the axis 3 of the laboratory coordinate system .",
    "the laboratory coordinate system is related to the metal surface .",
    "the angular brackets denote an average over the ensemble of realizations of the polycrystalline structure .",
    "we assume that the polycrystalline medium we are concerned with is statistically homogeneous , i.e. that the ensemble averages are independent of position .",
    "the only property of the medium that affects the one - point average , for example , @xmath71 , is the rotation of the crystallographic axes of the grain containing point @xmath6 with respect to the laboratory coordinate system .",
    "if the polycrystal is an untextured one , i.e. it is composed of single crystal grains randomly rotated with respect to each other , in eq.(3 ) @xmath16 correspond to the averaging over all possible rotations of the crystallographic axes of a grain at the surface .    to start the calculation",
    ", we would like to remind that since elements of the tensor @xmath56 are of the order of the ratio @xmath72 , the tangential components of the electric vector at the metal surface are always much less than the tangential components of the magnetic vector . in the lowest ( the zeroth ) order in @xmath73 ,",
    "the magnetic field strength at the metal surface is equal to the magnetic vector @xmath74 at the surface of a perfect conductor . in the zeroth approximation in @xmath73",
    "the vector @xmath75 is equal zero .",
    "the first nonvanishing term in the expansion of @xmath75 in powers of @xmath73 can be calculated with the aid of the local leontovich boundary conditions ( 1 ) : @xmath76 .",
    "\\eqno ( 4)\\ ] ]    to obtain the averaged tangential components of the vectors @xmath77 and @xmath78 in the lowest orders in powers of @xmath73 ( the zeroth and the first respectively ) we need to know the vector @xmath74 only : @xmath79 @xmath80>.     \\eqno ( 4.2)\\ ] ] if the vectors @xmath78 and @xmath77 are known , eq.(3 ) defines the effective surface impedance @xmath61 .",
    "now it is almost obvious that when the surface of an inhomogeneous metal is flat , the effective surface impedance tensor @xmath56 is @xmath81 indeed , in the case of normal incidence of an electromagnetic wave onto the flat surface @xmath66 of a perfect conductor the magnetic vector at the surface is @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the magnetic vector in the incident wave , and it does not depend on position at the surface .",
    "next , the normal @xmath41 to the surface @xmath66 is also independent of position . thus , from eqs.(4.1,2 ) we have : @xmath84 @xmath85 .",
    "\\eqno ( 6.2)\\ ] ] comparing eqs.(6 ) with eq.(3 ) we obtain the above mentioned eq.(5 ) .    in @xcite eq.(5 ) was obtained according to the general scheme and the first correction @xmath86 to the effective impedance due to the local impedance fluctuations was calculated .",
    "it has been shown that if the impedance depends on position at the surface , @xmath87 ; \\ ;   < { d}_{\\alpha\\beta}({\\bf x}_{\\parallel } ) > = 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath88 is the two dimensional position vector at the surface @xmath89 , the correction @xmath86 is of the order of @xmath90 @xmath91 .",
    "however , the leontovich boundary conditions ( 1 ) leads to the correct result for the amplitude of the reflected wave only if @xmath92 . the terms of the order of @xmath93 are outside of the framework of the leontovich boundary conditions applicability . then the correction term @xmath86 has to be omitted within the accuracy of the initial equations , eqs.(1 ) .",
    "thus , eq.(5 ) gives the value of the effective surface impedance which ca nt be improved in the framework of the leontovich boundary conditions applicability .",
    "the result is a nonperturbative one with respect to the inhomogeneity amplitude .",
    "it allows to calculate the effective impedance of strongly anisotropic polycrystals .",
    "to make use of eq.(5 ) , we need to know the local impedance of a polycrystal under the conditions of anomalous skin effect ( @xmath94 ) . in this case the current density @xmath26 and the electric field strength @xmath27 are related by non - local integral equations : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the matrix of linear integral operators ; the braces @xmath97 denote that @xmath26 is a functional of @xmath27 . to calculate this operator the kinetic theory must be used @xcite .    for polycrystals",
    "the conductivity tensor @xmath96 is a random operator . since the crystallographic axes of the anisotropic single crystal grains are rotated randomly with respect to each other , the electromagnetic wave crossing the boundary between adjacent grains in effect moves from one anisotropic medium into a different one .",
    "firstly , this means that when solving the kinetic equation , it must be taken into account that though the electron dispersion relation @xmath98 is the same for all the grains , the fermi surfaces of the adjacent grains are rotated with respect to each other in the @xmath44-space .",
    "then the nonscalar parameters relating to the fermi surface written with respect to a fixed set of laboratory axes differ for different grains .",
    "in particular , the electron velocity @xmath99 is not a function of the momentum @xmath44 only , but it depends on position @xmath6 too : @xmath100 .",
    "( naturally , the volume of the fermi surface and the total area of its surface are independent of @xmath6 . )",
    "secondly , we need to specify the boundary conditions at the interfaces of the grains . if the thickness of the grains interfaces is of the order of the atomic spacing , the random functions are step functions across the interfaces . in the model of the `` spread '' interfaces all the stochastic parameters across the interfaces vary smoothly over the distances , which are much greater than the atomic spacing , but much less than the mean size of the grain .",
    "next , to simplify the problem the relaxation time approximation ( the @xmath25-approximation ) for the collision integral in the kinetic equation can be used @xcite .",
    "it is known , that this approximation is sufficient in the limiting case @xmath30 . in our analysis",
    "we use the `` spread '' interfaces model",
    ". then the scattering at the grains interfaces has to be included in the electron relaxation ( mean free ) time @xmath25 , and @xmath25 itself is a random function of position @xmath6 .",
    "finally , boundary conditions at the metal surface @xmath101 and far from the surface @xmath102 have to be specified .",
    "it is evident that the calculation of the conductivity tensor for a polycrystal is a separate and a very difficult problem .    to get a proper starting point for our calculation",
    ", we first of all assume that the grains are sufficiently large and the mean size of the grains is much larger than the electron mean free path , where @xmath103 is the plasma penetration depth .",
    "usually the mean size of a polycrystalline grain @xmath104 . ] @xmath23 , @xmath105 since @xmath23 is of the order of the distance over which the electric field @xmath27 differs significantly , when eq.(8 ) is fulfilled , the current density @xmath26 in a grain is nearly the same as in the single crystal rotated with respect to the laboratory axes in the same way as the given particular grain .    when calculating , we assume that the relaxation time @xmath25 is a constant .",
    "it is not so essential , since usually when @xmath106 the relaxation time does not enter the leading term of the expression for the surface impedance @xcite .",
    "in addition , as an excuse , we would like to note that if the relaxation time depend on the electron energy only , @xmath107 , it does the same for all the grains .    for single crystals",
    "the boundary conditions on the real surface of the metal and the influence of these conditions on the impedance were analyzed by a lot of authors ( see , for example , ref .",
    "it has been shown that under the conditions of anomalous skin effect , the value of the surface impedance is not very sensitive to the character of the reflection of electrons from the sample surface . therefore , we use the simplest boundary conditions and assume the specular reflection of conductive electrons from the metal surface .    under all these assumptions it is clear that , the local surface impedance at a point @xmath6 on the surface of the polycrystal approximately equals to the surface impedance of the single crystal whose crystallographic axes are rotated with respect to the laboratory axes in the same way as the ones of the grain at the point @xmath6 .",
    "let s write down the elements of the local impedance tensor .      as we have mentioned above , from the theory of skin effect in single crystal metals it follows that under the conditions of extremely anomalous skin effect the assumption of the specular reflection of conductive electrons from the metal surface is sufficient .",
    "then the fourier method is efficient for the surface impedance calculation @xcite .",
    "the elements of the surface impedance tensor are expressed through their fourier coefficients @xmath108 : @xmath109 the two - dimensional tensor @xmath110 is defined in the laboratory coordinate system related to the metal surface .",
    "the axes @xmath111 and @xmath112 of this coordinate system are placed on the metal surface and the axis @xmath113 is directed along the normal @xmath41 to the surface .",

    "where the integration is carried out over the fermi surface in a single cell of the momentum space ; @xmath121 .",
    "the fermi surface is defined by the equation @xmath42 ; @xmath43 is the fermi energy .",

    "the last equation shows that the elements of the tensor @xmath124 are real .",

    "then , with regard to eqs.(10 ) - ( 12 ) we obtain the following expressions for the fourier coefficients of the local surface impedance : @xmath316 where @xmath317 , @xmath141 is given by eq.(16 ) , @xmath318 and @xmath319 @xmath320 .",

    "we present eqs.(44 ) to show that here , as in the case of an open cylindrical fermi surface , the poles of the fourier coefficients @xmath321 are the roots of 4th degree equations @xmath322 .",
    "in addition , we would like to mention , that the fourier coefficients ( 44 ) depend on all of the three euler angles .",
    "when eqs.(44 ) are substituted in eq.(9 ) and the integration is carried out , after the averaging with respect to the euler angles we obtain the effective impedance for the cubical fermi surface : @xmath323 numerical evaluation of the factor @xmath324 gives @xmath325 .",
    "we remind that @xmath141 is defined by eq.(16 ) with @xmath326 .    of course , there are no cubic fermi surfaces in real life .",
    "but there are metals whose fermi surfaces are close to polyhedrons ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this connection ,",
    "let s estimate when smoothing of the edges and the vertexes of the cube does not lead to a substantial change of the result ( 45 ) . since the value of the local surface impedance ( and ,",
    "consequently , the value of the effective impedance ) is defined by the elements of the conductivity tensor @xmath124 , it is sufficient to estimate when the contribution to @xmath124 from the smoothing regions is much less than the contribution from the sides of the cube .",
    "we remind that the contribution to the conductivity from the sides of the cube is given by eq.(42.2 ) and eq.(43 ) with @xmath145 from eq.(14.2 ) .",
    "when @xmath47 the elements of the conductivity tensor ( 42.2 ) are of the order of @xmath327 , @xmath328    let s estimate the contribution to the conductivity due to the smoothing of the vertexes of the cube .",

    "the characteristic size of the smoothing region in the direction along an edge is of the order of @xmath332 .",

    "then , if @xmath337 , the value of @xmath338 is limited by the inequality @xmath339 , or @xmath340    our result for the cubic fermi surface , eq.(45 ) , is similar to eq.(39 ) that is the effective impedance in the case of the cylindrical fermi surface . we have shown that in both cases the value of the surface impedance is defined by small conductivities of the order of @xmath170 .",
    "then the effective impedance depends on the mean - free path @xmath23 and significantly exceeds the characteristic value @xmath300 : @xmath341 .",
    "the unusual dependence of the surface impedance on the value of the mean - free path @xmath23 obtained for the metals with cubic or cylindrical fermi surfaces under the conditions of extremely anomalous skin effect , is the result of direct calculations .",
    "so , formally no further explanations are needed , but the calculations are rather tedious and therefore the answer is not obvious . to visualize the obtained result we use the pippard method @xcite .",
    "a.b.pippard called it the method of ineffective electrons .    under the conditions of anomalous skin effect",
    "when calculating the surface impedance the integral relation ( 7 ) between the current density @xmath26 and the electric field strength @xmath27 has to be used instead of the ohm low . according to pippard , in the case of extremely anomalous skin effect",
    "the correct result for the surface impedance can be obtained in the same way as under the conditions of normal skin effect , if we take into account the fact that the most part of the electrons at the fermi surface is ineffective . only a small part of the electrons that is @xmath342 times less than in the case of normal skin effect takes part in the reflection of electromagnetic waves .",
    "a.b.pippard used the standard local ohm law , where the conductivity @xmath343 was replaced by the effective value @xmath344 . in this way the presence of `` the belts '' on the fermi surface was taken into account .",
    "suppose , the introduction of the effective conductivity @xmath345 exhausts all the changes in the description of the extremely anomalous skin effect compared with the case of normal skin effect .",
    "then we can calculate the penetration depth @xmath18 and the surface impedance @xmath346 with the aid of the standard equations substituting @xmath345 for @xmath28 .",
    "in other words , due to `` the belts '' on the fermi surface , we can not simply omit @xmath111 in the denominator of the expression ( 13.1 ) for the conductivity @xmath124 .",
    "now let s suppose that under the conditions of extremely strong skin effect when calculating the principal values of the transverse conductivity @xmath347 for a given direction of the wave vector @xmath48 , we can neglect @xmath111 without the divergence of the integrals over the fermi surface at least for one of the principal values",
    ". since the impedance is defined by the smaller of the principal conductivities , the additional small factor @xmath342 appears in the effective conductivity @xmath345 : @xmath348 .",
    "when the pippard method is used , namely this effective conductivity provides the correct value of the impedance .",
    "now it is evident that @xmath349 then , with regard to the last equation @xmath350 .",
    "note that the pippard method allows us to define all the dimensional factors correctly , as well as the relation between real and imaginary parts of the impedance .",
    "if for a single crystal metal this situation takes place for a finite interval of the directions of the wave vector @xmath48 ( or , in other words , for a finite interval of the euler angles @xmath156 ) , the relation @xmath350 remains valid for the polycrystal too .",
    "the last is true since when averaging the leading term is defined by the euler angles corresponding to the maximal values of the local impedance . since all the conditions mentioned above are realized for polycrystals composed of the single crystal grains with cubic or cylindrical fermi surfaces , their impedance has to be proportional to @xmath351 .",
    "the last conclusion is consistent with eq.(39 ) and eq.(45 ) .",
    "the possibility to observe the effect of a change of the topology of the fermi surface on the properties of electrons was predicted by i.m.lifshitz @xcite .",
    "the change of the topology of the fermi surface takes place when the fermi energy equals to one of the critical values @xmath352 determined by band edges , local maxima and minima of the function @xmath353 and the van hove singularities .",
    "if the fermi surface is found in the vicinity of a critical point , it can be slightly `` corrected '' by some external effect ( e.g. applying pressure or adding some impurities ) .",
    "the change in the fermi surface topology is called the electronic topological transition . as a consequence of such a change",
    ", the properties of a metal determined by the fermi surface electrons , exhibit the singularities with different critical exponents .",
    "in particular , the singular addition to the thermodynamic potential at zero temperature is of the order of @xmath354 .",
    "this allowed i.m.lifshitz to call the electronic topological transition as the @xmath355 order phase transition in accordance with ehrenfest s terminology .",
    "two basic types of topological transitions are possible depending on the type of the critical point that the fermi surface passes through .",
    "they are :    \\1 . the formation of a new void of the fermi surface or the disappearance of an existing void when the critical point corresponds to an extremum of the function @xmath356 ;    \\2 .",
    "the creation or the disruption of a neck when the critical point corresponds to a conic point of the fermi surface .",
    "some exotic cases are also possible .",
    "for example , the critical points form a curve in the momentum space .",
    "this situation takes place for wurzite type crystals ( see subsection v.b below ) .",
    "an attempt to review theoretical papers devoted to the electronic topological transition has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "the detailed bibliography on the subject can also be found .",
    "kinetic properties of metals are especially sensitive to the fermi surface structure . for example",
    ", the conductivity exhibits anomalies near the topological transition .",
    "the analysis shows ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) that if the spatial dispersion of the conductivity is of no importance , the main influence of the topological transition on the value of the conductivity is indirect : the anomaly is related to the variation in the electron mean free path @xmath23 .",
    "this is not the case under the conditions of extremely anomalous skin effect , when the electron scattering is less important than the specifics of the motion of free electrons with complicated dispersion relation . in this case",
    ", the sensitivity of the kinetic properties to the structure of the fermi surface defines their strong dependence on the parameter @xmath357 .",
    "there are papers , where under the conditions of anomalous skin effect the surface impedance has been calculated for single crystal metals with complex fermi surfaces ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . also there are investigations of the surface impedance of single crystals in the vicinity of the electronic topological transition .",
    "the question we are investigating in this section is : whether the singularities related to the electronic topological transition `` survive '' in polycrystals , which , in effect , are isotropic metals . in what follows we show that the singularities do `` survive '' : the effective surface impedance of the polycrystal exhibits nontrivial behavior in the vicinity of the electronic topological transition .    even without the calculation",
    "it is easy to understand that when a new little void of the fermi surface appears , the derivative of the effective impedance has a jump .",
    "really , suppose we examine a single crystal metal in the vicinity of a critical point corresponding to an extremum of the function @xmath356 .",
    "then the newly appearde void is an ellipsoid . when calculating the singularity of the surface impedance under the conditions of extremely strong skin effect , it is usual to assume that even for electrons of the small void the mean free path @xmath358 .",
    "next , the surface impedance is proportional to @xmath359 ; @xmath134 is the total area of the fermi surface .",
    "after the formation of the new void @xmath360 , where @xmath361 is the area of the main part of the fermi surface and @xmath362 is the area of the new ellipsoidal void : @xmath363 . consequently , in the vicinity of the critical point the impedance @xmath364 , where @xmath365 until the formation of the void , and @xmath366 is the addition to the impedance caused by the appearance of the new void .",
    "thus , in the case of single crystal metal , the derivative of the impedance has a jump when @xmath367 .",
    "when calculating the effective impedance of the polycrystal , we have to average the surface impedance of a single crystal with respect to all possible rotations of the crystallographic axes with respect to the fixed set of laboratory axes .",
    "since in the vicinity of the topological transition the singular addition to the surface impedance caused by the formation of a new ellipsoidal void has the same sign and is of the same order for all the directions of the crystallographic axes , the averaging does not change the result and the derivative of @xmath144 also has a jump when @xmath367 .",
    "if the topological transition leads to the creation or the disruption of a neck of the fermi surface , the character of the effective impedance singularity can not be obtained without the calculation .",
    "the point is that the orientation of the neck defines `` a preferred direction '' , and the averaging strongly affects the value of the surface impedance . in what follows , we examined a polycrystal composed of the single crystal grains with the fermi surface of a goffered cylinder type",
    "this example provides a rather general description of the singularity near the conic point . usually under the topological transition ,",
    "the singularities of thermodynamic and kinetic characteristics depend only on the structure of the fermi surface in the vicinity of the point where the change of the topology occurs .",
    "our calculation does not contradict this rule .",
    "as we showed , the singular addition to the effective impedance depends only on the ratio of the effective masses at the point of the topological transition .",
    "the other example we examined was the polycrystal composed of the single crystal grains with the fermi surface of a wurzite crystal type ; the fermi energy is close to the critical value corresponding to the disappearance of the toroidal hole of the fermi surface and the appearance of the new ovaloid void .",
    "this example is an exotic one .",
    "it has been chosen following ref.@xcite because of the relative simplicity of analytical analysis .    in conclusion of this subsection one remark must be done .",
    "if the external pressure is used to observe the effect , it must be taken into account that in a polycrystalline sample , the stresses can be different in different grains",
    ". then the transition would be blurred .",
    "it is better to use polycrystals where the inhomogeneity of the stresses is minimal .",
    "may be the results of ref .",
    "@xcite will be useful for the choice of such polycrystals .",
    "let the polycrystal be composed of single crystal grains whose fermi surface with regard to the crystallographic axes is defined by the equation @xmath368 the length of the unit cell in the direction @xmath202 is @xmath271 .",
    "for the crystallographic axes we choose the origin of coordinates at the point @xmath369 , then @xmath370 .",

    "having in mind to calculate the change of the effective surface impedance in the vicinity of the electronic topological transition , we set @xmath374 the cases @xmath375 and @xmath376 must be examined separately .    since the area of the fermi surface @xmath138 varies under the variation of the fermi energy @xmath43 , it is not convenient to use @xmath142 ( see eq.(16 ) ) as the characteristic value of the surface impedance .",

    "then the measured value of @xmath472 is _ the effective area of the fermi surface related to anomalous skin effect_. next , the effective static conductivity of a strongly anisotropic polycrystal does not equal to the static conductivity , averaged over all possible rotations of the grains .",
    "the difference can be very big ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . then @xmath474 that enters the equation for the static condudtivity is an effective area defined with regard to the static conductivity",
    "of course , @xmath477 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , where the effective static conductivity of two - dimensional polycrystals has been compared with the effective conductivity related to normal skin effect ) , and this difference has to be taken into account when estimating the electron mean free path in polycrystals .    when the fermi surface is an axially symmetric surface , the expression for the effective impedance is much simpler , since the explicit form of the principal values @xmath478 and @xmath268 of the tensor @xmath149 ( see eq.(17 ) ) can be obtained ( see eqs .",
    "( 25 - 27 ) ) .",
    "we would like to point out that the fermi surfaces of the majority of real metals are extremely complex .",
    "they have many voids of different shapes and symmetry . if one of the voids is axially symmetric , but not all the others , eqs.(25)-(27 ) are inapplicable .",
    "we can use eqs.(25 - 27 ) only if the fermi surface is axially symmetric as a whole .    when calculating the effective impedance for some different model fermi surfaces ( section iv ) , several problems were the object of our investigation .",
    "first of all , the analysis of an ellipsoidal fermi surface is the first necessary step , when after the analysis of an isotropic conductor ( the conductor with the spherical fermi surface ) , we turn to the investigation of real anisotropic polycrystals , but the results of subsection iv.a also can be applied to bismuth type semimetals and some degenerate semiconductors . in this case , however , these results have to be generalized , since as a rule the fermi surfaces of semimetals and degenerate semiconductors are the sets of ellipsoids .",
    "the discussed cases of extremely anisotropic ellipsoids , besides being an illustration of the change of the effective area of the fermi surface ( see eq.(33.2 ) and eq.(33.3 ) ) , can be helpful when low - dimensional systems are analyzed : eq.(31.2 ) and the following ones where @xmath224 are relevant for the description of quasionedimensional conductors ; eq.(31.3 ) and the following ones where @xmath225 are relevant for the description of quasitwodimensional conductors .",
    "the analysis of metals with cylindrical ( subsection iv.b ) and cubic ( subsection iv.c ) fermi surfaces shows that the effective impedance of polycrystals can differ from the impedance of an isotropic metal _",
    "qualitatively_. by a qualitative difference we mean the dependence of @xmath144 on the mean free path @xmath23 under the conditions of extremely anomalous skin effect ( see eq.(39 ) and eq.(45 ) ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the results of section iv can be used as the first approximation under the description of real polycrystals . in particular ,",
    "the fermi surfaces of quasitwodimensional metals are slightly goffered cylinders .",
    "eq.(39 ) can be applicable to such metals if the binding of the conducting planes is weak and the goffering can be neglected . or , if the goffering can be considered as a perturbation , eq.(39 ) is the zeroth term of the perturbation theory",
    ".    we do not know whether there are metals whose fermi surfaces are close to a cube as a whole .",
    "apparently , there are metals with a nearly cubic main void of the fermi surface ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . by a main void we mean the one where electrons providing the conductivity of the metal are found . under the conditions of extremely strong anomalous skin effect such metals in the single crystal state , as well as in the polycrystalline state , must have the impedance depending on the electron mean free path ( see eq.(45 ) ) . in this case we also must pay attention to the unusual relation between the imaginary and real parts of the effective impedance .",
    "possibly just this fact will be helpful for the search of metals with the impedance ( 45 ) .",
    "one of the most important phenomena related to the geometry of the fermi surface is the electronic topological transition manifesting itself in the change of electronic properties of the metal due to the change of the topology of the fermi surface @xcite .",
    "in fact , all properties of the metal are `` sensitive '' to the topological transition ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but when characteristics of the phenomenon do not depend on the electron mean free path , the influence of the topological transition is particularly clear .",
    "extremely anomalous skin effect is one of such phenomena .",
    "our analysis shows that polycrystals also have singularities of the effective impedance due to the topological transition ( the singularities `` survive '' in polycrystals ) .",
    "when the value of the impedance of the single crystal metal is not very sensitive to the orientation of the crystallographic axes with respect to the metal surface , the character of the singularity of the effective impedance of the polycrystal is the same as in the single crystal .",
    "if the value of the impedance of the single crystal metal depends on the orientation of the crystallographic axes essentially ( as it takes place for the formation of a neck of the fermi surface , for example , of the goffered cylinder type ) , the character of the singularity can change ( see eqs.(53 ) and eqs.(54 ) ) .",
    "the results of sections iv and v confirm the following conclusion : if the anisotropy of the fermi surface is essential , the averaging necessary when calculating the effective impedance of polycrystals does not liquidate the influence of the geometry of the fermi surface .",
    "in other words , it is not sufficient to think about a polycrystal as of a metal with an effective spherical fermi surface , since in this case , some characteristic features of extremely anomalous skin effect in polycrystals can be missed .",
