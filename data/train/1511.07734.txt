    "a branching process , or galton - watson process ( see @xcite ) , is a process where a particle dies and gives birth to a random number of offspring , according to a given offspring law @xmath0 ( @xmath1 being the probability of having exactly @xmath2 children ) .",
    "different particles breed independently , all according to @xmath0 .",
    "unless @xmath3 , it is not completely trivial to tell whether the process survives ( with positive probability ) or it goes extinct ( almost surely ) .",
    "this question can be answered by looking at the fixed points of the generating function @xmath4 , which is defined for @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "there is almost sure extinction if and only if @xmath6 has only the fixed point @xmath7 .",
    "if there are two fixed points , namely @xmath7 and @xmath8 , then there is extinction with probability @xmath9 and survival with probability @xmath10 .",
    "if we require that @xmath11 then the generating function @xmath6 , being monotone and convex , has at most two fixed points , so this description settles all the possibilities for the branching process .    a branching random",
    "walk ( brw hereafter ) is a process where particles are described by their location @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is an at most countable set ( @xmath13 is usually interpreted as a spatial variable , but can also be seen as a `` type '' , see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "particles at site @xmath12 are replaced by a random number of children , which are placed at various locations on @xmath13 .",
    "this class of processes ( in continuous and discrete time ) has been studied by many authors ( see @xcite just to mention a few ) ; a survey on the subject can be found in @xcite .",
    "note that , in the case of the branching random walk , there is no upper bound for the number of particles per site .",
    "when such an upper bound is fixed , say at most @xmath14 particles per site , we get the @xmath14-type contact process .",
    "the branching random walk can be obtained as the limiting process as @xmath14 goes to infinity ( @xcite ) .",
    "the behaviour of a brw is in general more complex than the one of a branching process : if we start with one particle at a given site @xmath15 , only one of the following holds for the brw : ( 1 ) it goes almost surely extinct , ( 2 ) it survives globally but not locally , ( 3 ) it survives globally and locally but with different probabilities ( non - strong local survival ) , ( 4 ) it survives globally and locally with equal probability ( strong local survival ) .",
    "we stress that there is no strong local survival when either there is non - strong local survival or almost sure local extinction .",
    "again , some answers can be obtained through the study of the multidimensional generating function @xmath16 , defined on @xmath17^x$ ] , associated to the process .",
    "it is easy to note that all the extinction probabilities are fixed points of @xmath16 , therefore if one proves that there is only one fixed point then there is almost sure extinction ( the vector @xmath18 , defined as @xmath19 for all @xmath12 , is always a fixed point ) .",
    "if there are at least two fixed points then there is global survival starting from some vertices and the extinction probability starting from @xmath15 coincides with @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the smallest fixed point ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 2.2 and section 3 ) ) . for a long time , it has been believed ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3 ) ) that , in the irreducible case , no more than two fixed points were possible .",
    "this was disproved in @xcite , even though it remains true for irreducible brws on finite sets ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 3.1 ) ) . in this framework ,",
    "two questions naturally arise : how many fixed points can the generating function of an irreducible brw have ?",
    "at least in the irreducible case , are all fixed points also extinction probabilities ?",
    "section  [ sec : q&a ] provides a negative answer to these questions : examples  [ exmp : reduciblemorefixedpoints ] and [ exmp : irreduciblemorefixedpoints ] are a reducible and an irreducible brws respectively , where there are only two extinction probabilities but the set of fixed points is uncountable .",
    "we also show that the topological properties of the multidimensional @xmath16 are different from the one - dimensional case : @xmath16 may not be convex ( example  [ exmp : counterexample1 ] ) .",
    "moreover , the set @xmath22^x \\colon g(\\mathbf{z})\\le   \\mathbf{z}\\}$ ] is not necessarily convex and its extremal points may be neither fixed points nor extremal points of @xmath17^x$ ] ( examples  [ exmp : counterexample2 ] and [ exmp : counterexample3 ] ) .",
    "since extinction probabilities are fixed points of @xmath16 , it is clear that if we know that @xmath16 has only two fixed points and that the brw survives locally , then there is strong local survival .",
    "conversely , if there is non - strong local survival , then there must be at least three fixed points .",
    "somehow related is the question of what happens if we modify locally ( that is , on a fixed @xmath23 ) a given brw : for instance if the original brw has no strong local survival , what can be said about the modified brw ?",
    "theorem  [ th : modifiedbrw ] shows that there is global survival and no strong local survival in @xmath24 in the original brw if and only if there is global survival and no strong local survival in @xmath24 in the modified brw ( regardless of the modifications that have been introduced in @xmath24 ) . as a corollary",
    "we get that if the original brw dies out locally in @xmath24 and the modified brw survives globally , then almost sure global extinction for the original one is equivalent to strong local survival in @xmath24 for the modified brw ( corollary  [ cor : pureweak - nonstrong - discrete ] ) . moreover , for a fixed irreducible brw , if there is global survival and no strong local survival in some @xmath25 then there is global survival and no strong local survival in all finite @xmath26 .    from these results in discrete time ,",
    "we are able to prove that , in continuous time , a modification of the brw in a finite subset @xmath24 , which lowers the weak critical parameter ( something that can usually be achieved by adding a sufficiently fast reproduction rate at some site ) , implies that the weak and strong parameter of the modified brw coincide .",
    "this allows us to describe a general method to produce examples such as example  [ th : nonstrongandstrong ] , where the modified brw has strong local survival for some values of the parameter below a threshold and above another threshold , but non - strong local survival for intermediate values of the parameter ( figures  [ fig : t3 ] and [ fig : t3modified ] ) .",
    "this example was originally described in @xcite but appears here with an easier proof and in a more general framework .",
    "moreover , we prove that in general , a continuous - time brw which is obtained by a local modification of another brw , lowering its weak critical parameter , dies out globally at the weak critical parameter ( which is not always true , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 3 ) ) .    here is the outline of the paper : in section  [ sec : basic ] we introduce the terminology , describe the most common types of brws and their features and define the multidimensional generating function associated to a brw .",
    "section  [ sec : q&a ] is devoted to the questions about the generating function , its fixed points and the extinction probabilities . in section  [ sec : survivalprob ] we address the problem of the possible behaviour of modified brws .",
    "section  [ sec : proofs ] contains the proofs of the results and the detailed computations for the examples .",
    "the most general example of a brw lives in discrete time and it can be constructed easily as a process @xmath27 on a set @xmath13 which is at most countable , where @xmath28 is the number of particles alive at @xmath29 at time @xmath2 .",
    "the dynamics is described as follows : consider the ( countable ) measurable space @xmath30 where @xmath31 and let @xmath32 be a family of probability measures on @xmath30 . a particle of generation @xmath2 at site @xmath12 lives one unit of time ;",
    "after that , a function @xmath33 is chosen at random according to the law @xmath34 .",

    "the brw is denoted by @xmath39 .",
    "the total number of children associated to @xmath38 is represented by the function @xmath40 defined by @xmath41 ; the associated law @xmath42 is the law of the random number of children of a particle living at @xmath15 .",
    "some results rely on the _ first - moment matrix _ @xmath43 , where each entry @xmath44 represents the expected number of children that a particle living at @xmath15 sends to @xmath36 ( briefly , the expected number of particles from @xmath15 to @xmath36 . for the sake of simplicity , we require that @xmath45 .",
