    "exo 0748 - 676 is a transient lmxrb discovered with exosat ( parmar et al . , 1986 ) with a 3.82  hr orbital period measured from its",
    "x - ray eclipses .",
    "it is a type i x - ray burster and displays quasi periodic oscillations ( discovered with rossixte , homan et al . , 1999 ;",
    "homan & van der klis , 2000 ) as well as intensity dips and x  ray eclipses ( parmar et al . 1986 ; church et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "it shows a complex soft x - ray spectrum ( thomas et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "church et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , analysing dip and non - dip asca spectra , interpreted the source spectrum as composed by an extended accretion disk corona ( adc ) , producing the hard emission , plus a point - like soft black - body emission .",
    "the spectral evolution during dipping is explained with the progressive covering of the adc emission .",
    "a different view on the system came from epic / xmm - newton observations , which revealed a persistent ( i.e. , no dipping and no eclipsing ) spectrum composed by an extended thermal halo together with a highly absorbed , and more compact , high energy power - law produced in the adc ( bonnet - bidaud et al . ,",
    "2001 ) .",
    "rgs / xmm - newton observations detected absorption and emission lines from ionized ne , o and n ( cottam et al.,2001 ) .",
    "the cumulative rgs spectra during type i x - ray bursts revealed iron absorption lines , from which a gravitational redshift of z=0.35 have been measured ( cottam et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "chandra observations confirmed the presence of photoionized plasma , probably located above the accretion disk .",
    "the chandra spectrum during dips was absorbed both by neutral and ionized material ( jimenez - garate et al . , 2003 ) .    a recent analysis of several xmm - newton observations revealed for the first time the clear detection of eclipses below 2 kev ( homan et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the source was observed with bepposax in 2000 , november , for an on - source time of 66  ks .",
    "we report here spectral results from all the instruments on - board bepposax : lecs ( 0.1 - 10 kev ) , mecs ( 1.8 - 10.8 kev ) , hpgspc ( 5 - 120 kev ) and pds ( 15 - 200 kev ) ( sidoli et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "the source lightcurve in the 1.8 - 10 kev band is shown in fig .  1 , where all kind of variabilities typical of this source are evident : x  ray",
    "eclipses , dips , type i x  ray bursts .",
    "we concentrate here on the  persistent \" spectrum ( no - dipping , no - eclipsing , no - bursting spectrum ) . in order to select the persistent emission , we considered only events where the source displays a constant low hardness ratio ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "we tried to fit the  persistent \" spectrum with several models , all including a high energy cut - off powerlaw in order to account for the high energy part of the spectrum . in fig .",
    "2 the count spectrum ( together with the residuals ) is reported , fit with an absorbed cut - off powerlaw .",
    "there is clearly evidence for a soft excess and other structured residuals , especially in the low energy part of the spectrum .",
    "trying to model this soft excess with soft components ( blackbody or hot plasma models ( i.e. mekal in xpsec ) ) or different kinds of absorptions ( e.g. partial covering model , differential absorbing models for the soft and the hard spectral components ) resulted in non - satisfactory fits ( @xmath3 @xmath42 ) .    among all spectral deconvolutions tested , a cut - off power - law absorbed with an ionized absorber ( with a non - solar iron abundance ) resulted in a significanlty better fit . an additional absorption line at @xmath52.16  kev is needed to get a good fit to the spectrum ( see table  1 for the best - fit parameters ) .",
    ".best - fit parameters for the broad - band bepposax `` persistent '' spectrum of exo 0748 - 676 .",
    "the meaning of the symbols is the following : @xmath6 is the interstellar column density , @xmath7 is the local absorbing column density due to the ionized absorber .",
    "@xmath8 is the ionization parameter ( @xmath8=l / nr@xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the luminosity of the x  ray illuminating source , @xmath11 is the absorbing plasma density and @xmath12 is the distance of the absorbing matter from the ionizing source ) .",
    "the parameters of the cut - off power - law are @xmath13 , the cut - off power - law photon index and @xmath14 , the high energy cut - off .",
    "@xmath15 is the centroid energy of the absorption line with a width @xmath16 and an intensity @xmath17 .",
    "the fluxes reported here are  observed \" fluxes ( not corrected for the absorption ) .",
    "the luminosity has been corrected _ only _ for interstellar absorption and calculated for a distance of 10  kpc [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     currently a reanalysis of the data is in progress taking into account the recent results of homan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) who found a change in the spectrum below 2 kev , which is not visible above 2 kev ( i.e. our selection criterion ) .",
    "this represents low - level dipping activity and might cause  mixing \" of spectra which might affect our results at low energies .",
    "we have discussed here the first observation of the broad - band x  ray emission of the dipping lmxrb exo  0748 - 676 showing that this source displays significant emission up to 100  kev .    the best - fit model to the ",
    "persistent \" spectrum consists of a cut - off power - law , extra - absorbed at low energies by an ionized absorber with non - solar iron abundance .",
    "the need for an ionized absorber indicates that absorbing matter local to the binary system is located over most or all of the orbital period ."
