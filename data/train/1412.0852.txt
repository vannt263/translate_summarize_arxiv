    "despite the great advances that have been made , understanding how galaxies form and evolve with time remains an ongoing challenge in modern astronomy .",
    "galaxies are complex , with the relevant physics occurring on size scales ranging from individual stars and black holes through to galaxy clusters . a multi - wavelength approach to the problem",
    "is clearly required , as the different processes and evolutionary stages are characterised by emission mechanisms spanning the full electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "although observations of the stellar component of galaxies are routinely made for large samples of objects over significant sky areas ( e.g. sloan digital sky survey , sdss , @xcite ) to high redshift ( e.g. vimos vlt deep survey , vvds , @xcite ) , observations of the gas in galaxies lags behind . as cold gas serves as the reservoir from which stars form , the non - trivial relationship between the gas and stellar content of galaxies is fundamental to understanding their evolution .",
    "observations of both the stellar and gaseous components of galaxies are required to illuminate the interplay between the two .    targeted observations of small numbers of individual galaxies",
    "provide important insight .",
    "the  nearby galaxy survey ( things , @xcite ) focuses on relatively local , highly resolved galaxies , enabling discrete sites of star formation activity to be individually assessed based on observations of the neutral and molecular gas ( @xcite ) . from these specific studies ,",
    "the general relations , observed on galaxy scales , can be better understood ( such as the kennicutt - schmidt law for star formation ; @xcite , or @xcite ) .",
    "large surveys , although insensitive to the details extracted from targeted observations , reveal global trends governing the general population . often , statistical studies of such surveys provide insight into processes too subtle to discern from individual objects . at optical wavelengths ,",
    "the sdss has been particularly effective at uncovering global trends in the stellar properties of galaxies , such as the red sequence and blue cloud galaxy bimodality seen by @xcite , for example .    the square kilometre array ( ska , @xcite ) will revolutionize the study of extragalactic gas reservoirs , enabling neutral hydrogen ( ) to be observed to @xmath2 over a significant fraction of the sky , bringing  observations more in line with optical surveys , both in terms of sensitivity and area coverage .",
    "the ska pathfinder and precursor instruments apertif ( @xcite ) , meerkat ( @xcite ) and the australian square kilometre array pathfinder ( askap , @xcite ) , currently under construction will already represent great advances themselves , due to innovative receiver design and expanded frequency range .",
    "along with advancing instrumentation , models of galaxy evolution are becoming increasingly sophisticated , with improved mass resolution and more physical prescriptions .",
    "in modern semi - analytic models , galaxy baryonic mass is partitioned into gas and stars , while the gas is further subdivided into atomic and molecular components using a variety of methods ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the interplay between gas and stars is then governed by prescriptions based on local conditions .",
    "smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations , such as those of @xcite , have the resolution required to follow the detailed dynamics of gas and stars on sub - galactic scales , but have insufficient volume to model statistically representative samples of galaxies .",
    "these simulations are invaluable , as they allow us to explore the interactions between the various galactic components , including the influence of the dark matter haloes ( @xcite ) .",
    "in the current work , we focus on the dependence of  mass ( ) on stellar mass within the -selected galaxy population , and we exploit this framework to compare observations with simulations .",
    "the relation between the stellar and gaseous components in galaxies appears straightforward at first glance , but the details provide insight into the history of both gas accretion and star formation , and reveals the potential for further star formation .",
    "differences between the observed and simulated relations offer the opportunity to explore missing physics or other factors driving galaxy evolution currently not incorporated in the simulations .",

    "these galaxies are dominated by metal - enriched disks , with gas - phase oxygen metallicities , 12+log(o / h ) , compiled by the mpa  jhu group , reaching solar values and above .",
    "this is consistent with the conclusion reached in @xcite , which shows that the alfalfa population primarily exists within the blue cloud .",

    "the completeness of alfalfa as a function of  flux and profile width is discussed in @xcite . assuming no self - absorption , the total  flux received from a galaxy depends only on the  mass , and the luminosity distance to the galaxy , @xmath18 , in mpc :    @xmath19    where  is in solar masses , and the integral is the total flux in jy .",

    "the simulated galaxies with moderate stellar masses ( @xmath44@xmath45 ) are also too -poor with respect to the observed data .",
    "this suggests that model galaxies of present - day stellar masses around @xmath46  recently had too little cold gas accretion or star formation efficiency was too high .",
    "this , in turn , could indicate missing physics in the model , such as a missing prescription for ram pressure stripping or neglected non - linearities in the partitioning between ionised , atomic and molecular gas",

    "although a hint of a break in the relation is seen from the popping et al .",
    "simulations , it is at @xmath48 , much higher than seen in the data .",

    "[ fig : paper_sims ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : mikagergo ] , none of the simulated galaxies reproduce the two regimes , implying a mass - dependent ingredient is missing in the prescriptions regulating the  fraction in galaxies .",
    "in fact , galaxies are not scale - free with respect to their fraction . whether the transition is governed by stellar mass , mass or dark matter halo properties",
    "is unclear .",
    "considering the complexity of the interactions between gas and stars , and the diversity of galactic environments , it is remarkable that a distinct upper envelope of  mass at a given stellar mass exists at all .",
    "one might naively expect that stochastic processes such as environment - dependent gas accretion , different types of outflows , galaxy mergers and subsequent triggered star formation prohibit such a relation . in the following discussion we attempt to explain the upper  envelope , and the break in the slope seen in the data at @xmath1 .",
    "the buildup of  mass and stellar mass is different from other mass relations , such as the correlation between the mass of central black holes and their host spheroids . in the former ,",
    "stellar mass is built at the expense of the  reservoir .",
    "a major merger of two gas - rich disks results in a triggered burst of star formation , resulting in a massive stellar system with only a fraction of the resulting total mass retained as . for the latter mass relation ,",
    "both the black hole and spheroid can continue to grow , provided there is a source of fuel .",
    "it is important to remember that the objects appearing in the current work are -selected , and represent only galaxies with a significant mass of neutral hydrogen .",
    "the figures show a snapshot during the phase when they are -rich , and does not represent an evolutionary locus for galaxies to follow .",
    "galaxies below the mass sensitivity of the alfalfa survey galaxy lie below the locus of points .      from fig .",
    "[ fig : mhi_mstellar ] , it is clear that there is a stellar mass - dependent upper limit on galaxies -to - stellar mass ratio . in the following , we investigate possible causes of this upper limit .",
    "while discussing the properties of the alfalfa galaxies , @xcite make a convincing argument for galaxies with higher  fractions at a given stellar mass existing in dark matter haloes with larger spin parameters , and thus have more extended disks ( see their figure 14b ) .",
    "this is consistent with work from @xcite , who find that haloes with large spin parameters host more extended  disks , along with a more quiescent star formation history .",
    "a similar link between halo spin parameter and  disk size is found in @xcite .",
    "also note that there is a tight positive correlation between the mass of an  disk and the  disk radius , as seen in figure 7 of @xcite , showing that as disks become more massive , they grow larger .",
    "this is a natural consequence of the upper limit on  density found by @xcite , for example , beyond which  rapidly becomes molecular .    following the method outlined in @xcite ,",
    "we compute the dark matter halo spin parameters for the alfalfa  sdss galaxies . from @xcite , we define the dimensionless halo spin parameter , @xmath49 , as :    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the rotation velocity of the disk , @xmath52 is the scale length of the stellar disk , assumed to have an exponentially declining surface density , and @xmath53 is the halo mass",
    ". equation [ eq : lambda ] is only appropriate for mass distributed in regular disks , which the vast majority of galaxies at the high stellar mass end are .",
    "further , equation  [ eq : lambda ] assumes that an equal fraction of mass and specific angular momentum is transferred from the halo to the disk , i.e. @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "we determine the galaxies inclination , @xmath28 , using the @xmath55-band axis ratio @xmath56 from the sdss imaging , and assume an intrinsic axis ratio of @xmath57 for reasons outlined in @xcite :    @xmath58    from this we can convert the  profile width from the alfalfa catalogue , @xmath59 , into the rotation velocity , @xmath51 , via @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath52 is extracted from the sdss database as the @xmath55-band exponential fit scale radius , converted to kpc .",
    "we convert the @xmath51 to the rotation velocity of the associated dark matter halo , @xmath61 , via the relation found in @xcite .",
    "finally , the virial mass of the dark matter halo is determined from the relation derived from simulations from @xcite , where .",
    "empirically , we find a positive correlation between  fraction and halo spin : at any fixed stellar mass @xmath62 , galaxies with higher  fractions sit in haloes with higher spin parameters .",
    "this finding is consistent with the picture that a high spin can stabilise a large  disk to prevent it from clumping and forming stars .",
    "a natural consequence of this finding is that very high  mass fractions , or equivalently , very high  masses at a given stellar mass , would require very high spin parameters .",
    "however , theoretically , the spin is limited by the amount of infall and tidal torque haloes can experience during the proto - galactic growth .",
    "explicit numerical n - body simulations of cdm - haloes by @xcite find an upper limit around @xmath63 , independent of halo mass .",
    "this value is consistent with the highest spin parameters measured in this study . combining the theoretical prediction of an upper limit in the spin parameter with the empirical correlation between spin and fraction provides a plausible explanation of the  fraction in galaxies : the maximum  fraction is set by the upper limit in the spin parameter .",
    "as  observations only provide a measure of the neutral gas content , the upper limit on  mass could also be due to ionization of the neutral gas .",
    "@xcite find that the  density in the things galaxies they studied is too high for the background ionizing field to be responsible for the sharp truncation of  disks , indicating that the maximum  mass seen here is not due to increasingly large quantities of ionized gas , but is rather an accurate reflection of an upper limit of the gas content of galaxies .",
    "galaxy interactions , or ram - pressure stripping , are also able to truncate  disks . however , as -rich galaxies are generally found in low - to - moderate density environments ( @xcite , @xcite ) , neither of these effects dominate the properties of the galaxies discussed here .",
    "investigating the dark matter halo spin parameter upper limit , and the formation of large galaxies in haloes with high spin parameter , will help explain the behaviour of the most -massive galaxies and the corresponding upper limit on  mass . at these high stellar masses ,",
    "the galaxies are regular , massive disks , which are resistant to small perturbations , and star formation can proceed efficiently .",
    "the ghmass project ( @xcite ) aims to study in detail the most -rich , massive galaxies .",
    "preliminary results for two galaxies from their sample @xcite indicate that one , ugc 12506 , indeed has a large , extended  disk and is located in a rapidly spinning dark matter halo , consistent with the general trend found here .",
    "the other , ugc 9037 , has a more centrally concentrated  distribution , with non - circular flows within the disk .",
    "fairly regular optical and  morphology argues against a recent major merger , rather suggesting accretion from a gaseous halo .",
    "similar analyses of their full sample will illuminate the relative importance of dark matter halo spin properties as compared to environmental or morphological factors for the high mass galaxy population .      at the low stellar mass end ( @xmath64 )",
    ", the upper envelope is not delimited by high halo spin parameter , even though these galaxies have the largest  fractions of all the galaxies . therefore",
    ", some other mechanism must restrict the  fraction . to test",
    "whether environmental effects set an upper limit in  in these low - mass galaxies , we employ the morphological information derived from the galaxy zoo project ( @xcite ) , which can separate the alfalfa  sdss galaxies into ` spirals ' , ` mergers ' , or ` unknown ' morphologies , based on human votes . in practice , it is difficult to distinguish between ` mergers ' and ` unknowns ' , thus we simply require that the galaxies have low probability of being ` spirals ' , @xmath65 .",
    "we refer to the resulting galaxies as irregular .",
    "the following is not sensitive to the exact restrictions on the galaxy type percentages .    at stellar masses below @xmath66 ,",
    "the upper envelope of fraction is heavily populated by irregular galaxies .",
    "as the galaxies are low mass , their morphology is easily disrupted .",
    "the number of irregular galaxies then drops significantly between @xmath66@xmath67@xmath43 , coinciding with the break in the relation at @xmath1 .",
    "the predominance of irregular galaxies at low masses may explain why there is no ordered gradient of halo spin parameters with fraction .",
    "the high  fractions at low stellar mass imply either inefficient star formation in the past , or recent accretion of significant amounts of neutral gas , or a combination of both . using further information from the mpa ",
    "jhu catalogue , we find that the galaxies with the highest fractions also have the highest current specific star formation rates of all the alfalfa galaxies .",
    "the metallicity is also lowest for the highest galaxies , dropping below solar values to 12+log(o / h)@xmath68 .",
    "these two ingredients , coupled with the galaxies irregular morphology , favour recent gas accretion .",
    "these galaxies could also have recently experienced an interaction with another gas - rich , low mass galaxy .",
    "further  observations at higher resolution , and deeper optical imaging , would be required to distinguish between the interaction and accretion scenarios .",
    "the link between  and molecular gas , primarily , is clearly an important stage in star formation , and in disk galaxies is found to be related to pressure ( @xcite ) . for the low - mass galaxies , the lack of massive disks may result in less efficient star formation .",
    "testing this hypothesis requires simulations with sufficient resolution to follow gas accretion onto galaxies with @xmath69 , coupled with detailed observations of molecular gas of a sample of galaxies .",
    "the transition between the spin - regulated and morphology - regulated regimes , at @xmath1 , also coincides with the transition mass identified within the smoothed particle hydrodynamical simulations of @xcite .",
    "they find , at halo masses below @xmath70 , corresponding to baryonic masses of @xmath71 , cold accretion is the dominant accretion mode , whereas at masses greater than this , gas accretion switches to hot mode .",
    "this is consistent with the low stellar mass galaxies having recently accreted a significant mass of cold gas .",
    "despite the complicated interactions between galaxies and their environments , along with energetic internal processes , there is a distinct upper limit on the mass fraction of neutral hydrogen a galaxy is able to support .",
    "this upper limit argues against the existence of a significant population of the so - called ` dark galaxies ' , which are -rich but host very few stars .",

    "<S> the stellar and neutral hydrogen ( ) mass functions at @xmath0 are fundamental benchmarks for current models of galaxy evolution . a natural extension of these benchmarks is the two - dimensional distribution of galaxies in the plane spanned by stellar and mass , which provides a more stringent test of simulations , as it requires the  to be located in galaxies of the correct stellar mass . combining  data from the alfalfa survey , with optical data from sdss , we find a distinct envelope in the -to - stellar mass distribution , corresponding to an upper limit in the  fraction that varies monotonically over five orders of magnitude in stellar mass . </S>",
    "<S> this upper envelope in  fraction does not favour the existence of a significant population of dark galaxies with large amounts of gas but no corresponding stellar population . </S>",
    "<S> the envelope shows a break at a stellar mass of @xmath1 , which is not reproduced by modern models of galaxy populations tracing both stellar and gas masses . </S>",
    "<S> the discrepancy between observations and models suggests a mass dependence in gas storage and consumption missing in current galaxy evolution prescriptions . </S>",
    "<S> the break coincides with the transition from galaxies with predominantly irregular morphology at low masses to regular disks at high masses , as well as the transition from cold to hot accretion of gas in simulations .    </S>",
