    "it is generally believed that the present expansion of the universe is accelerating due to the presence of some unknown cosmic ` matter ' with negative pressure generally termed as _ dark energy_. the simplest and the most favoured candidate of dark energy is einstein s cosmological constant @xmath0 , which is though plagued with horrible fine tuning problems .",
    "this happens due to the presence of two values of @xmath0 differing from each other by some 120 orders of magnitudes : the magnitude of @xmath0 at the beginning of inflation and the value given by the present - day observations .",
    "this has led a number of cosmologists to consider models of evolving dark energy , by either proposing different phenomenological laws or by considering different potentials of the scalar fields which are more or less ad - hoc .",
    "the precise mechanism of the evolution of dark energy , which could be required by some symmetry principle , is not yet known . indeed ,",
    "since the basic motivation in these models is to understand the present - day smallness of @xmath0 , they do not provide any natural relation between the magnitude of @xmath0 at the beginning of inflation and the present - day observational value .",
    "it would be worth while to investigate some symmetry principles behind the problem crying out for the evolution of dark energy and thus develop a more realistic and fundamental model for dark energy .",
    "moreover it is always reasonable to consider symmetry properties of spacetime rather than considering ad - hoc assumptions . in this view",
    ", we have discovered @xcite a model resulting from a contracted ricci - collineation which , apart from having interesting conservation properties , does provide a dynamical law for decaying @xmath0 .",
    "the physical properties of the model have been discussed in @xcite and it was found that the model had a credible magnitude - redshift ( @xmath1-@xmath2 ) relation for the observations of supernovae ( sne ) of type ia from perlmutter et al . @xcite . since then many observations of sne ia",
    "have been made , quite many at higher redshifts , by the hubble space telescope .",
    "it would be worthwhile to examine how well ( or badly ) the model fits the new data .",
    "like the luminosity of a standard candle , the angular size @xmath3 of a standard measuring rod changes with its redshift @xmath2 in a manner that depends upon the parameters of the model .",
    "hence the @xmath3-@xmath2 relation is also proposed as a potential test for cosmological models by hoyle @xcite .",
    "therefore , it would also be worthwhile to examine the @xmath3-@xmath2 relation in this model for the dataset of jackson and dodgson @xcite , which is a trustworthy compilation of ultracompact radio sources and has been already used to test different cosmological models @xcite . in the following section we describe the model in brief for ready reference and to derive the observational relations .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "as we are going to consider a dynamical @xmath0 in einstein s theory , it would be worthwhile to mention a general result which holds irrespective of the dynamics of @xmath0 : the empty spacetime of de sitter can not be a solution of general relativity with a dynamical @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this follows from the divergence of the field equation @xmath5_{;j}=0=\\left[t^{ij}_{(\\rm m)}-g^{ij}\\lambda(t)/8\\pi g\\right]_{;j}$ ] .",
    "obviously a solution with a dynamical @xmath4 is possible only if @xmath6 ( and @xmath7 ) .",
    "we assume that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic , represented by the robertson - walker ( rw ) metric , and its dynamics is given by the einstein field equations @xmath8    @xmath9    where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are respectively the scale factor and curvature index appearing in the rw metric ; and @xmath12 , @xmath13 , with @xmath0 representing the cosmological term .",
    "it is well known that collineations of ricci tensor ( @xmath14 ) have interesting symmetry properties and lead to useful conservation laws in general relativity @xcite .",
    "the ricci collineation along a vector @xmath15 is defined by vanishing lie - derivative of @xmath14 along @xmath15 : @xmath16 .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that in general relativity the contracted ricci - collineation along the fluid flow @xmath17 ( normalized velocity 4-vector ) , i.e. , @xmath18 , leads to the conservation of generalized _ momentum density _ :",
    "@xmath19 for the rw metric , the conservation law ( [ eq : con1 ] ) leads to the conservation of the total active gravitational mass of a comoving sphere of radius @xmath10 : @xmath20 ( a detailed discussion elaborating on the meaning of ( [ eq : con2 ] ) has been done in @xcite .",
    "consequences of the resulting models for the case @xmath21 have been discussed in @xcite . ) as there are 4 unknowns @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) and the scale factor @xmath10 , the equations ( [ eq : rchaudhuri ] ) , ( [ eq : freedman ] ) and ( [ eq : con2 ] ) , together with the usual barotropic equation of state @xmath26 constant @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) for the matter source , provide a unique solution of the model . by using ( [ eq :",
    "con2 ] ) in the raychaudhuri equation ( [ eq : rchaudhuri ] ) and integrating the resulting equation , we get @xmath29 supplying the dynamics of the scale factor , where @xmath30 is a constant of integration . equations ( [ eq : freedman ] ) , ( [ eq : con2 ] ) and ( [ eq : h ] ) supply the unique dynamics of dark energy density @xmath24 and @xmath22 as @xmath31,\\label{eq : lam}\\ ] ] @xmath32.\\label{eq : rhom}\\ ] ] it must be noted that we have not assumed the conservation of the matter source which is usually done through the additional assumption of no interaction ( minimal coupling ) between different source fields ( except for the case with a constant @xmath0 which is consistent with the idea of minimal coupling ) , which though seems ad - hoc and nothing more than a simplifying assumption . on the contrary , interaction is more natural and is a fundamental principle .",
    "let us recall that the only constraint on the source terms , which is imposed by einstein s equation ( through the bianchi identities ) , is the conservation of the sum of all the energy - momentum tensors , individually they are not conserved : @xmath5_{;j}=0=\\left[t^{ij}_{(\\rm m)}+t^{ij}_{(\\lambda)}+t^{ij}_{(\\phi)}+ ... \\right]_{;j}$ ] , implying creation or annihilation for the case @xmath4 .",
    "it may be noted that the evolution of @xmath24 , as given by equation ( [ eq : lam ] ) , is a function of the equation of state of matter .",
    "this may be regarded as a kind of generalization of the ansatz @xmath33 proposed by many authors @xcite , which is obtained in the present model in the present phase of evolution of the universe ( @xmath34 ) .    in order to study the @xmath3-@xmath2 and the @xmath1-@xmath2 relations in the model , we can rewrite equations ( [ eq : h]-[eq : rhom ] ) by specifying the constants @xmath35 and @xmath30 in terms of the cosmological parameters in the present phase of evolution : @xmath36 ,   @xmath37 ,  giving @xmath38    @xmath39\\frac{h_0 ^ 2}{h^2(z)},\\ ] ]    where @xmath40^{1/2}.\\label{eq : hubble}\\ ] ] here @xmath41 are , as usual , the energy density of different source components of the cosmological fluid in units of the critical density @xmath42 ( i denoting matter ( @xmath43 ) , cosmological term ( @xmath0 ) , etc . ) .",
    "the subscript ` 0 ' denotes the value of the quantity at the present epoch .",
    "the angular size - redshift ( @xmath3-@xmath2 ) relation in the model is given by hoyle s formula @xmath44 which relates the apparent angular diameter @xmath3 of the source ( of redshift @xmath2 located at a coordinate distance @xmath45 ) with its absolute angular size @xmath46 ( presumably same for all sources ) .",
    "the coordinate distance @xmath45 can be calculated from the rw metric according to its curvature parameter @xmath11 : @xmath47 the present value of the scale factor @xmath48 , appearing in equations ( [ eq : hoyle ] , [ eq : rdist ] ) , which measures the present curvature of spacetime , can be calculated from @xmath49 as the measured angular sizes of the radio sources in the dataset from jackson and dodgson are given in units of milli arc second ( mas ) , we rewrite equation ( [ eq : hoyle ] ) as @xmath50 where @xmath46 is measured in pc ( par sec ) and @xmath51 is the present value of the hubble constant @xmath52 measured in units of 100 km s@xmath53mpc@xmath53 .",
    "we are now able to calculate the angular size @xmath54 of a radio source at a given redshift @xmath2 predicted by the model ( for a given set of the parameters @xmath55 ) by using equations ( [ eq : hubble ] , [ eq : rdist]-[eq : hoyle1 ] ) .",
    "we also recall that the usual magnitude - redshift ( @xmath1-@xmath2 ) relation in a homogeneous and isotropic model ( based on the rw metric ) is given by @xmath56 where @xmath1 is the apparent magnitude of a sn of redshift @xmath2 located at the coordinate distance @xmath45 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 is the absolute magnitude ( presumably same for all sne ia ) , and @xmath59 is the luminosity distance of the sn given by @xmath60 now we can calculate the magnitude @xmath61 of a sn at a given redshift @xmath2 predicted by the model ( for a given set of the parameters @xmath62 ) by using equations ( [ eq : hubble ] , [ eq : rdist ] , [ eq : szero ] , [ eq : mag ] , [ eq : dl ] ) .    in order to fit the model to the observations , we calculate @xmath63 according to @xmath64 ^ 2,\\label{eq : chi}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the observed value of the observable , @xmath66 is its predicted value at the redshift @xmath67 , @xmath68 is the uncertainty in the observed value @xmath65 and @xmath69 is the number of data points ( or bins ) .",
    "( @xmath70 stands for @xmath3 and @xmath1 respectively for the data of radio sources and sne ia . )",
    "we use the sample of 256 ultracompact radio sources compiled by jackson and dodgson @xcite .",
    "this sample of 256 radio sources with @xmath2 in the range 0.5 to 3.8 was selected by them from a bigger sample of 337 ultracompact radio sources originally compiled by gurvits @xcite .",
    "these sources , of angular sizes of the order of a few milliarcseconds ( ultracompact ) , were measured by the _ very long - baseline interferometry_. the points of the sample of jackson and dodgson are short - lived quasars deeply embedded inside the galactic nuclei , which are expected to be free from evolution on a cosmological time scale and thus comprise a set of standard rods , at least in a statistical sense .",
    "jackson and dodgson binned their sample into 16 redshift bins , each bin containing 16 sources .",
    "we fit the present model to this sample by calculating @xmath63 according to ( [ eq : chi ] ) and minimize it with respect to the free parameters @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the global minimum is obtained for the values ( with the constraint @xmath74 )    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     these models have been shown in figure 2 . in order to have a visual comparison of the fits of different models to the actual data points , we magnify their differences by plotting the relative magnitude with respect to a fiducial model @xmath75 ( which also has a good fit : @xmath63/dof @xmath76 , @xmath77 ) .",
    "in order to test the consistency of the cosmological models with observations as well as to estimate the different cosmological parameters , data on sne of type ia and radio sources have been used by several authors .",
    "we use the recent gold sample of sne ia from riess et al . and the sample of 256 ultracompact radio sources ( of angular sizes of the order of a few milliarcseconds ) compiled by jackson and dodgson to test a model of dark energy which results consistently from the contracted ricci - collineation along the fluid flow vector .",
    "we find that the model has excellent fits to both the data sets and the estimated parameters are also in good agreement .",
    "the author thanks abdus salam ictp for hospitality .      though there is not a clearly defined value of @xmath63/dof for an acceptable fit , however it is obvious from equation ( [ eq : chi ] ) that if the model represents the data correctly , the difference between the predicted angular size / magnitude and the observed one at each data point should be roughly the same size as the measurement uncertainties and each data point will contribute to @xmath63 roughly one , giving the sum roughly equal to the number of data points @xmath69 ( more correctly @xmath78number of fitted parameters @xmath79 number of degrees of freedom ` dof ' ) .",
    "this is regarded as a _ ` rule of thumb ' _ for a _ moderately _ good fit .",
    "if @xmath63 is large , the fit is bad .",
    "however we must quantify our judgment and decision about the _ goodness - of - fit _",
    ", in the absence of which , the estimated parameters of the model ( and their estimated uncertainties ) have no meaning at all .",
    "an independent assessment of the goodness - of - fit of the data to the model is given in terms of the @xmath63-_probability _ : if the fitted model provides a typical value of @xmath63 as @xmath80 at @xmath81 dof , this probability is given by @xmath82 roughly speaking , it measures _ the probability that the model does describe the data genuinely and any discrepancies are mere fluctuations which could have arisen by chance_. to be more precise , @xmath83 gives the probability that a model which does fit the data at @xmath81 dof , would give a value of @xmath63 as large or larger than @xmath80 .",
    "if @xmath84 is very small , the apparent discrepancies are unlikely to be chance fluctuations and the model is ruled out .",
    "for example , if we get a @xmath85 at 5 dof for some model , then the hypothesis that _ the model describes the data genuinely _ is unlikely , as the probability @xmath86 is very small .",
    "it may however be noted that the @xmath63-probability strictly holds only when the models are linear in their parameters and the measurement errors are normally distributed .",
    "it is though common , and usually not too wrong , to assume that the @xmath63- distribution holds even for models which are not strictly linear in their parameters , and for this reason , the models with a probability as low as @xmath87 are usually deemed acceptable @xcite .",
