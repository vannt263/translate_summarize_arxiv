    "in this survey , we present aspects of a geometric theory of @xmath0-adic ( or nonarchimedean ) fractal strings , that is , bounded open subsets of the @xmath0-adic line @xmath2 having a fractal subset of @xmath2 for `` boundary '' .",
    "this theory , developed by michel lapidus and l hng in [ [ laplu1 ] , [ laplu2 ] ] , as well as by those same authors and machiel van frankenhuijsen in [ [ laplu3 ] ] , extends in a natural way the theory of real ( or archimedean ) fractal strings and their complex dimensions developed in [ [ l - vf1 ] , [ l - vf2 ] ] , and building on [ [ lap3 ] , [ lapma ] , [ lappo ] ] , for example .",
    "following [ [ laplu1 ] , [ laplu2 ] , [ laplu3 ] ] , we introduce suitable geometric zeta functions , the poles of which play the role for @xmath0-adic fractal strings of the complex dimensions for the standard real fractal strings .",
    "furthermore , we discuss the analogies and the differences between the real and @xmath0-adic fractal strings .    more specifically ,",
    "we recall the definition of @xmath0-adic self - similar strings introduced in [ [ laplu2 ] ] ; furthermore , we show ( as in [ [ laplu2 ] ] ) that all @xmath0-adic self - similar strings are lattice ( in a strong sense ) and deduce from this fact the simple periodic structure of their complex dimensions . we also discuss the explicit fractal tube formulas obtained in [ [ laplu3 ] ] , both in the general case of ( languid ) @xmath0-adic fractal strings and that of @xmath0-adic self - similar strings . throughout this paper ,",
    "these various results are illustrated in the case of suitable nonarchimedean analogs of the cantor and the fibonacci strings ( which are both self - similar ) , as well as in the case of a new ( and non self - similar ) @xmath0-adic fractal string , namely , the @xmath0-adic euler string introduced in [ [ laplu3 ] ] .",
    "some particular attention is devoted to the nonarchimedean ( or 3-adic ) cantor string ( introduced and studied in [ [ laplu1 ] ] ) , an appropriate counterpart of the archimedean cantor string , whose ` metric ' boundary is the nonarchimedean ( or 3-adic ) cantor set ( [ [ laplu1 ] ] ) , a suitable @xmath0-adic analog of the classic ternary cantor set .",
    "we note that @xmath0-adic ( or nonarchimedean ) analysis has been used in various areas of mathematics ( such as representation theory , number theory and arithmetic geometry ) , as well as ( more speculatively ) of mathematical and theoretical physics ( such as quantum mechanics , relativity theory , quantum field theory , statistical and condensed matter physics , string theory and cosmology ) ; see , e.g. , [ [ drag ] , [ dykkv ] , [ ulam ] , [ rtv ] , [ vvz ] ] and the relevant references therein .",
    "in particular , it is believed by some authors that @xmath0-adic numbers ( or , more generally , nonarchimedean fields ) can be used to describe the geometry of spacetime at very high energies and hence , very small scales ( i.e. , below the planck or the string scale ) ; see , e.g. , [ [ vol ] ] .",
    "furthermore , several physicists and mathematical physicists have suggested that the small scale structure of spacetime may be fractal ; see , e.g. , [ [ gibhaw ] , [ hawis ] , [ lap2 ] , [ not ] , [ whefo ] ] .",
    "on the other hand , in the recent book [ [ lap2 ] ] , it has been suggested that fractal strings and their quantization , fractal membranes , may be related to aspects of string theory and that @xmath0-adic ( and possibly , adlic ) analogs of these notions would be useful in this context in order to better understand the underlying ( noncommutative ) spacetimes and their moduli spaces ( [ [ lap2 ] , [ lapne ] ] ) .",
    "the theory of @xmath0-adic fractal strings , once suitably ` quantized ' , may be helpful in further developing some of these ideas and eventually providing a framework for unifying the real and @xmath0-adic fractal strings and membranes .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows :    in  [ css ] , we give a brief survey of the main pertinent properties of the cantor string and set , both in the real ( or archimedean ) and the 3-adic ( or nonarchimedean ) situations .",
    "this will serve , in particular , as a pedagogical introduction to the general theory of real and @xmath0-adic fractal ( and possibly self - similar ) strings .    in  [ pfs ] , we recall the definition of an arbitrary @xmath0-adic fractal string , along with some of the key pertaining notions ( geometric zeta function and complex dimensions , as well as minkowski dimension and content ) .",
    "we also discuss the more technical question of how to suitably define and calculate the volume ( i.e. , @xmath0-adic haar measure ) of the ` inner ' @xmath3-neighborhood ( or inner tube ) of a @xmath0-adic fractal string (  [ inner tube ] ) . because they truly depend on the nonarchimedean ( specifically , @xmath0-adic ) nature of the underlying geometry . ] in  [ mdimension ] , we then use these results to express this volume as an infinite sum over the underlying complex dimensions , thereby obtaining a nonarchimedean analog of the ` fractal tube formula ' of [ [ l - vf1 ] , [ l - vf2 ] ] .",
    "we illustrate this formula in ",
    "[ explicit tf ] by providing ( as well as deriving via a direct computation ) the fractal tube formula for the @xmath0-adic euler string , the definition of which is given in ",
    "[ euler string ] .    in  [ sss ] , we focus on the important special class of @xmath0-adic self - similar strings , of which the 3-adic cantor string and the 2-adic fibonacci string are among the simplest examples . after having explained their construction in  [ construction ] via an iterated function ( or self - similar ) system , we provide ( in  [ gzf sss][zeros and poles ] ) a detailed study of their geometric zeta functions and complex dimensions .",
    "it turns out that due to the discreteness of the valuation group of @xmath4 all @xmath0-adic self - similar strings are ` strongly lattice ' (  [ periodicity ] ) , from which it follows that their complex dimensions ( along with the zeros of their geometric zeta functions ) are periodically distributed along finitely many vertical lines (  [ zeros and poles]).-adic self - similar fractal strings is more natural as well as simpler than its archimedean counterpart . ]",
    "it follows that ( under mild assumptions ) the fractal tube formula of a @xmath0-adic self - similar string involves finitely many ( multiplicative ) periodic functions , one for each ` line ' of complex dimensions .",
    "we describe such explicit tube formulas in some detail in  [ exact tf ] and also obtain in  [ amc ] an explicit expression for the average minkowski content of a @xmath0-adic self - similar string ( and the associated nonarchimedean self - similar set ) .    throughout this expository paper and comparative survey",
    ", we illustrate some of the main results by discussing the examples of the nonarchimedean cantor , euler and fibonacci strings .",
    "moreover , we point out the main analogies and differences between the archimedean and nonarchimedean theories of fractal strings",
    ".    finally , in  [ conclusion ] , we conclude this paper by proposing several possible research directions for future work in this new field .",
    "this includes , in particular , a possible extension of the nonarchimedean theory of fractal strings and their tube formulas to berkovich spaces , along with seemingly new and quite challenging problems in nonarchimedean spectral , harmonic and functional analysis .",
    "in this section , we briefly recall , for a simple but important example , some of the main notions pertaining to the theory of real and @xmath0-adic fractal strings .",
    "namely , the geometric zeta function , the complex dimensions , and the ` fractal tube formula ' that expresses the volume of the inner @xmath3-neigborhoods of a suitable boundary of the string as a ` fractal power series ' with exponents involving the underlying complex dimensions .    in the archimedean case ,",
    "the classic example is the real cantor string (  [ cs ] ) , whose boundary ( or associated self - similar set ) is the ternary cantor set (  [ c ] ) ; cf .",
    "[ [ l - vf2 ] , ch . 1 ] .",
    "the nonarchimedean counterpart of the real cantor set or string is the 3-adic cantor set or string , discussed in ",
    "[ c3 ] or  [ cs3 ] , respectively ( and both introduced in [ [ laplu1 ] ] ) .",
    "in particular , the 3-adic cantor set is the nonarchimedean self - similar set naturally associated with the 3-adic cantor string ( which is a special case of @xmath0-adic self - similar string , in the sense of [ [ laplu2 ] ] and  [ sss ] below ) .",
    "finally , a comparative study of the archimedean and nonarchimedean cantor strings and their respective fractal tube formulas is provided in  [ comparison ] .",
    "it will help us preview some of the main analogies and differences between the real and @xmath0-adic theory of fractal ( and possibly , self - similar ) strings , as further discussed and developed in  [ pfs ] and  [ sss ] .",
    "the classical archimedean ( or ternary ) cantor set , denoted by @xmath5 , is the set that remains after iteratively removing the open middle third subinterval(s ) from the closed unit interval @xmath6.$ ] the construction is illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "there , for each @xmath7 @xmath8 is the compact set defined as the union of @xmath9 compact intervals of length @xmath10 and endpoints the ternary points of ` scale ' @xmath11 ( i.e. , of the form @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) .",
    "hence , the archimedean cantor set @xmath5 is equal to @xmath15 .    for comparison with our results in the nonarchimedean case , we state the following well - known results ( see , e.g. , [ [ fal ] ,",
    "ch . 9 ] and [ [ gj ] , p. 50 ] ) :    [ fixed point ] the archimedean cantor set @xmath16 is self - similar . more specifically , it is the unique nonempty , compact invariant set in @xmath17\\subset \\mathbb r$ ] generated by the iterated function system ( ifs ) @xmath18 of affine similarity contraction mappings of @xmath19 $ ] into itself , where @xmath20 that is , @xmath21    [ expansion ] the archimedean cantor set is characterized by the ternary expansion of its elements as @xmath22 ~ : ~\\tau = a_0 + a_13^{-1 } + a_23^{-2 } + \\cdots , ~a_j \\in \\{0,2\\ } , \\forall j \\geq 0\\right\\}.\\ ] ]    we note that , as usual , we choose the nonrepeating ternary expansion here ( so that none of the coefficient @xmath23 is equal to 1 , and hence , the sequence of digits does not end with @xmath24 , where the overbar indicates that 1 is repeated ad infinitum ) .",
    "such a precaution will not be needed in  [ c3 ] for the elements of @xmath25 because the 3-adic expansion is unique .",

    "@xmath26 is defined as the complement of the ternary cantor set in the closed unit interval @xmath17 $ ] . by construction",
    ", the topological boundary of @xmath26 is the ternary cantor set @xmath5 .",
    "the cantor string is one of the simplest and most important examples in the research monographs [ [ l - vf1 ] , [ l - vf2 ] ] by lapidus and van frankenhuijsen .",
    "indeed , it is used throughout those books to illustrate and motivate the general theory ; see also , e.g. , [ [ lap ] ] and [ [ lappo ] ] . from the point of view of the theory of fractal strings and their complex dimensions [ [ l - vf1 ] , [ l - vf2 ] ] , it suffices to consider the sequence @xmath27 of lengths associated to @xmath26 . and @xmath28 .",
    "] more specifically , these are the distinct lengths of the intervals of which the bounded open set @xmath29 is composed , counted according to their multiplicities .- adic fractal string ,",
    "there are two equivalent ways of keeping track of its associated lengths .",
    "either by considering its distinct lengths , counted according to their multiplicities , as above , or else by considering the sequence of all of its lengths , written in nonincreasing order ( and hence , tending to zero , except in the trivial case when the fractal string is composed of finitely many intervals ) . ] accordingly , the archimedean cantor string consists of @xmath30 interval of length @xmath31 , @xmath32 intervals of length @xmath33 , @xmath34 intervals of length @xmath35 , and so on ; see figure 2 .",
    "[ cantor string ]    important information about the geometry of @xmath26 , e.g. , the minkowski dimension and the minkowski measurability , is contained in its _ geometric zeta function _",

    "the corresponding set of poles of @xmath39 is then given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the _ oscillatory period _ of @xmath44 .",

    "then it can be computed directly ( as in [ [ l - vf2 ] ,  1.12 ] ) to depend only on the lengths of @xmath52 and to be given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is as in ( [ cdcs ] ) .",
    "the general theme of the monographs [ [ l - vf1 ] , [ l - vf2 ] ] is that _ the complex dimensions describe oscillations in the geometry and the spectrum of a fractal string . _ in particular , due to the presence of nonreal complex dimensions on the vertical line @xmath55 there are oscillations of order @xmath56 in the geometry of @xmath26 and therefore its boundary , the ternary cantor set , is _ not _ minkowski measurable ; see [ [ lappo ] ] , [ [ l - vf2 ] ,  1.1.2 ] .",
    "our goal in this section is to provide a natural nonarchimedean ( or @xmath0-adic ) analog of the classic ternary cantor set @xmath16 and to show that it satisfies a counterpart of many of the key properties of @xmath16 in this nonarchimedean context .",

    "[ cs3 ] that the corresponding @xmath0-adic fractal string , called the nonarchimedean ( or 3-adic ) cantor string and denoted by @xmath57 , is an exact analog of the ordinary archimedean cantor string @xmath26 , a central example in the theory of real fractal strings and their complex dimensions [ [ l - vf1 ] , [ l - vf2 ] ] .",
    "the nonarchimedean cantor set and string were both introduced and studied in detail in [ [ laplu1 ] ] .",
    "we begin by recalling a few simple facts concerning the field of @xmath0-adic numbers @xmath4 equipped with the standard @xmath0-adic absolute value @xmath58 and associated topology ; see , e.g. , [ [ kob ] , [ rob ] , [ sch ] ] .",

    "a remarkable property of the nonarchimedean ` unit interval ' @xmath74 of @xmath2 , which does not have any analog for the archimedean unit interval @xmath17 $ ] of @xmath51 , is that @xmath74 is a ring , and in particular , is stable under addition ; see , e.g. , [ [ har ] ] for a thorough discussion of this point .",
    "indeed , @xmath75 if @xmath76 moreover , @xmath74 is a compact group and as such , admits a unique translation invariant measure , to be also denoted by @xmath77 , which is the restriction to @xmath74 of haar measure @xmath77 on @xmath2 .",
    "finally , note that unlike its real counterpart @xmath17 $ ] ( or @xmath78 $ ] ) , @xmath74 is not connected ; actually , it is totally disconnected .",
    "this well known fact , combined with the ` self - duplicating property ' ( [ decomposition ] ) , will naturally lead us to suitably modify many of the definitions and results of the standard theory of ordinary real fractal strings .",
    "consider the ring of 3-adic integers @xmath79 . in a procedure reminiscent of the construction of the classic ternary cantor set ( see  [ c ] ) , we construct the _ nonarchimedean _ ( or _ 3-adic _ ) _ cantor set _ as follows .",

    "we then remove the `` middle third '' subinterval @xmath81 and call @xmath82 the remaining set : @xmath83 .",
    "we then repeat this process with each of the remaining subintervals , i.e. , with @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",

    "then , in light of theorems [ expansion ] and [ 02 ] , @xmath106 is a continuous bijective map from @xmath5 onto @xmath86 .",
    "since both @xmath5 and @xmath86 are compact spaces in their respective natural metric topologies , @xmath106 is a homeomorphism .    in view of theorem [ homeomorphism ] , like its archimedean counterpart , the nonarchimedean cantor set @xmath90 is compact , totally disconnected , uncountably infinite and has no isolated points . in particular , it is a perfect and complete metric space ; furthermore , its topological dimension is 0 .",

    "<S> we give a brief overview of the theory of complex dimensions of real ( archimedean ) fractal strings via an illustrative example , the ordinary cantor string , and a detailed survey of the theory of @xmath0-adic ( nonarchimedean ) fractal strings and their complex dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we present an explicit volume formula for the tubular neighborhood of a @xmath0-adic fractal string @xmath1 , expressed in terms of the underlying complex dimensions . special attention will be focused on @xmath0-adic self - similar strings , in which the nonarchimedean theory takes a more natural form than its archimedean counterpart . in contrast with the archimedean setting , </S>",
    "<S> all @xmath0-adic self - similar strings are lattice and hence , their complex dimensions ( as well as their zeros ) are periodically distributed along finitely many vertical lines </S>",
    "<S> . the general theory is illustrated by some simple examples , the nonarchimedean cantor , euler , and fibonacci strings . throughout this comparative survey of the archimedean and nonarchimedean theories of fractal ( and possibly , self - similar ) strings , we discuss analogies and differences between the real and @xmath0-adic situations . </S>",
    "<S> we close this paper by proposing several directions for future research , including seemingly new and challenging problems in @xmath0-adic ( or rather , nonarchimedean ) harmonic and functional analysis , as well as spectral theory .            _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ nature is an infinite sphere of which the center is everywhere and the circumference nowhere . </S>",
