    "massive stars can lose a significant fraction of their original mass during their short lifetimes due to their strong , radiation - driven stellar winds .",
    "accurate determinations of these stars mass - loss rates are therefore important from an evolutionary point of view , as well as for understanding the radiative driving process itself .",
    "massive star winds are also an important source of energy , momentum , and ( chemically enriched ) matter deposition into the interstellar medium , making accurate mass - loss rate determinations important from a galactic perspective .",
    "a consensus appeared to be reached by the late 1990s that the mass - loss rates of o stars were accurately known observationally and theoretically , using the modified @xcite cak @xcite theory of line - driven stellar winds .",
    "this understanding was thought to be good enough that uv observations of spectral signatures of their winds could be used to determine their luminosities with sufficient accuracy to make extragalactic o stars standard candles @xcite .",
    "this consensus has unraveled in the last few years , mostly from the observational side , where a growing appreciation of wind clumping  an effect whose importance has long been recognized @xcite  has led to a re - evaluation of mass - loss rate diagnostics , including @xmath5 emission , radio and ir free - free emission , and uv absorption @xcite .",
    "accounting for small - scale clumping that affects density squared emission diagnostics  and also ionization balance and thus ionic column density diagnostics like uv resonance lines  leads to a downward revision of mass - loss rates by a factor of several , with a fair amount of controversy over the actual factor @xcite .",
    "x - ray emission line profile analysis provides a good and independent way to measure the mass - loss rates of o stars . like the uv absorption line diagnostics , x - ray emission profile diagnostics are sensitive to the wind column density and thus are not directly affected by clumping in the way density - squared diagnostics are . unlike the uv absorption line diagnostics",
    ", however , x - ray profile analysis is not very sensitive to the ionization balance ; moreover , as it relies on continuum opacity rather than line opacity , it is not subject to the uncertainty associated with saturated absorption lines that hamper the interpretation of the uv diagnostics .    in this paper",
    ", we apply a quantitative line profile analysis to the _ chandra _ grating spectrum of the early o supergiant , @xmath0  pup , one of the nearest o stars to the earth and a star that has long been used as a canonical example of an early o star with a strong radiation - driven wind .",
    "previous analysis of the same _ chandra _ data has established that the kinematics of the x - ray emitting plasma , as diagnosed by the line widths , are in good agreement with wind - shock theory , and that there are modest signatures of attenuation of the x - rays by the dominant cold wind component in which the shock - heated x - ray emitting plasma is embedded @xcite .",
    "the work presented here goes beyond the profile analysis reported in that paper in several respects .",
    "we analyze many lines left out of the original study that are weak , but which carry a significant amount of information .",
    "we better account for line blends and are careful to exclude those lines where blending can not be adequately modelled .",
    "we model the continuum emission underlying each line separately from the line itself .",
    "we use a realistic model of the spectrometers responses and the telescope and detector effective area .",
    "and we include the high energy grating ( heg ) spectral data , where appropriate , to augment the higher signal - to - noise medium energy grating ( meg ) data that @xcite reported on .",
    "implementing all of these improvements enables us to derive highly reliable values of the fiducial wind optical depth parameter , @xmath1 , for each of sixteen emission lines or line complexes in the _ chandra _ grating spectrum of @xmath0  pup . using a model of the wavelength - dependent wind opacity , @xmath6 , and values for the star s radius , @xmath7 , and wind terminal velocity , @xmath8 , derived from uv and optical observations",
    ", we can fit a value of the mass - loss rate , @xmath9 , to the ensemble of @xmath2 values , and thereby determine the mass - loss rate of @xmath0  pup based on the observed x - ray emission line profiles .    in doing this",
    ", we also can verify that the wavelength - dependence of the optical depth values  derived separately for each individual line ",
    "is consistent with that of the atomic opacity of the bulk wind , rather than the gray opacity that would , for example , be obtained from an extremely porous wind @xcite .",
    "while a moderate porosity might reduce somewhat the effective absorption while still retaining some wavelength dependence , for simplicity our analysis here assumes a purely atomic opacity set by photoelectric absorption , with no reduction from porosity .",
    "this assumption is justified by the large porosity lengths required for any appreciable porosity effect on line profile shapes @xcite and the very small - scale clumping in state - of - the - art two - dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , preliminary results indicate that profile models that explicitly include porosity are not favored over ones that do not @xcite .",
    "we will extend this result in a forthcoming paper but do not address the effect of porosity on individual line profile shapes directly in the current work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we begin by describing the _ chandra _ data set and defining a sample of well behaved emission lines for our analysis in  2 .",
    "we briefly evaluate the stellar and wind properties of @xmath0  pup in  3 . in  4 we describe the empirical profile model for x - ray emission lines and report on the fits to the sixteen usable lines and line complexes in the spectrum .",
    "we discuss the implications of the profile model fitting results in  5 , and summarize our conclusions in  6 .",
    "all the data we use in this paper were taken on 28 - 29 march 2000 in a single , 68 ks observation using the _ chandra _ high - energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ) in conjunction with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) detector in spectroscopy mode @xcite .",
    "this is a photon counting instrument with an extremely low background and high spatial resolution ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the first - order grating spectra we analyzed have a total of 21,684 counts , the vast majority of which are in emission lines , as can be seen in fig .  [",

    "we modelled every line or line complex  21 in total  as we describe in  4 , and indicate in this figure which of the lines we deemed to be reliable .",

    "( see  [ subsubsec : line_blends ] for a discussion of the excluded line blends . )",
    "the hetgs assembly has two grating arrays - the medium energy grating ( meg ) and the high energy grating ( heg ) - with full - width half maximum ( fwhm ) spectral resolutions of 0.0023  and 0.0012  , respectively .",

    "the x - ray spectrum of @xmath0  pup consists of emission lines from h - like and he - like ionization stages of n , o , ne , mg , si , and s , and numerous l - shell lines of iron , primarily fe xvii .",
    "the @xmath15 lines and often the @xmath16 and even @xmath17 lines of the lyman series are seen for the h - like ions .",
    "there is a weak bremsstrahlung continuum beneath these lines .",
    "overall , the spectrum is consistent with an optically thin , thermal plasma in ionization equilibrium with a range of temperatures from one to several million degrees present .",
    "it is possible that there are deviations from equilibrium , although the spectrum is not of high enough quality to show this .",
    "there is some evidence from the _ xmm - newton _ rgs spectrum that a few of the emission lines are optically thick @xcite ; a possibility we will take into account when discussing the results for those lines .",
    "@xmath0 puppis is a relatively nearby , bright , and well - studied early o supergiant ( o4 if ) that shows the enhanced nitrogen and deficient carbon and oxygen that is indicative of cno cycle processed material .",
    "helium is also overabundant @xcite .",
    "the star s rapid rotation may explain the photospheric abundances , though they may instead have resulted from the supernova explosion that is invoked to explain its high space velocity @xcite . on the other hand , no special mechanism may need to be invoked if the lifetime of mass - loss of @xmath0  pup has removed enough of the star s envelope to expose nuclear processed material .",
    "there is some uncertainty regarding the distance to @xmath0  pup .",
    "the spectroscopic parallax @xcite and trigonometric parallax @xcite are in good agreement ( @xmath18 pc and @xmath19 pc , respectively ) .",
    "but it has also been suggested that @xmath0  pup lies farther away , at @xmath20 pc , where its space motion and age are consistent with an origin in the vela molecular ridge @xcite .",
    "this larger distance implies a larger radius and an @xmath5 mass - loss rate that is larger by a factor of two . on the other hand , the _ hipparcos _ data has recently been reanalyzed and a smaller distance  332 pc  has been found @xcite .",
    "we stress that the adopted distance does not affect the x - ray line profile fitting results directly .",
    "but it does affect the mass - loss rate we derive from our fits via the dependence of @xmath9 on @xmath7 , and it affects the fiducial mass - loss rate to which we compare the value we derive from the x - ray profiles in this paper .",
    "the @xmath5 and radio mass - loss rates scale as @xmath21 and the mass - loss rate we derive from the profile fitting results scales as @xmath22 , so the ratio scales only as the square root of the distance .",
    "thus , any change in the distance will not strongly affect the discrepancy we find between the fiducial mass - loss rate and the one we derive from the x - ray line profiles .",
    "the radius we use for our mass - loss rate calculation in this paper assumes the spectroscopic parallax distance of 460 pc , which is also assumed for the fiducial @xmath5 mass - loss rate determination .",
    "detailed spectral synthesis has been carried out from the uv to the ir to determine the stellar and wind properties of @xmath0  pup , which we list in table [ tab : properties ] .",
    "most of these parameters are taken from @xcite .",
    "there is a range of wind property determinations in the extensive literature on @xmath0  pup .",
    "the terminal velocity of the wind may be as low as 2200 km s@xmath12 @xcite , and as high as 2485 km s@xmath12 @xcite , though we adopt the determination by the munich group @xcite , of 2250 km s@xmath12 , as our standard .",

    "however some blends  composed of lines from different ionization states or different elements  are more problematic , as their relative strengths are generally more uncertain . in some cases , the blending is mild  through a combination of the second line being weak and the overlap region being small  and we can fit the stronger of the components reliably by simply excluding some of the data .",
    "this was the case for the ne x @xmath15 line at 12.134  , where the extreme red wing is mildly blended with a weak iron line .",
    "in other cases , like the fe xvii lines at 17.051 and 17.096  , where the relative intensities of the components are well constrained by atomic physics , we obtain reliable results .",
    "but this situation is generally only true when the overlap between lines is modest and , especially , when both lines arise from the same ionization state of the same element , as is the case for these fe xvii lines .",
    "there are , however , several blends where the modelling of the relative line strengths is simply too uncertain to draw any reliable conclusions .",
    "a good example of this is the n vii @xmath15 line at 24.781  , which is blended with the n vi he@xmath16 line at 24.890  . for this line blend",
    "we fit a series of models with two components  one for the @xmath15 line and one for the he@xmath16 line  trying different values of their relative normalizations , all within a plausible range ( of 0.1 to 0.4 ) as implied by the astrophysical plasma emission database ( aped ) @xcite .",
    "we found values for the fiducial optical depth , @xmath2 , ranging from less than 1 to more than 4 .",

    "in addition to the n vii and n vi blend near 24.8  , the complexes that we had to reject include the helium - like neon complex near 13.5  , which is blended with at least seven iron lines that have relative strengths which are temperature dependent , and the o @xmath24 line at 16.006  , which is blended with four fe xviii lines , and two complexes near 11.0  and 15.26  that contain numerous weak lines arising from fe xvi , fe xvii , and several higher ionization states of iron .",

    "we summarize the sixteen derived @xmath2 and @xmath23 values , along with their confidence limits , in fig.[fig : scatter ] .",
    "we have made various assumptions and choices in carrying out the line - profile modelling described in the previous subsection .",
    "and we therefore have investigated many of these , again using the fe xvii line at 15.014  as a test case . in this subsection",
    ", we report on the sensitivity of our results to the following assumptions and choices : background subtraction ; determination of the continuum level ; exclusion of portions of the line due to possible blending ; inclusion of the weak heg data ; the adopted values of @xmath16 and @xmath8 for the wind ; and whether to allow the x - ray volume filling factor to vary with radius ( as parameterized by @xmath27 in @xmath28 , where the filling factor , @xmath29 , contributes to the emissivity , @xmath30  see @xcite ) .",
    "we will very briefly describe those factors that we found to be unimportant , and discuss in more detail those that did make a difference .",
    "the baseline model fitting we describe here is the modelling described in the previous subsection for the 15.014  line , except that we fit only the meg data ( so that we may evaluate the effect of including the heg data ) .",
    "we examined the default background spectra , which were very weak , and also experimented with fitting the 15.014  line with and without the background spectrum subtracted and found almost no difference in the fit quality or fit parameters .",
    "we therefore opt to neglect the background when fitting each of the lines in the spectrum .",
    "the sensitivity to the continuum fit is a little greater , but still nearly negligible . when we changed the continuum level by a factor of two  which is larger than the formal uncertainty on the continuum level ",
    "none of the parameter values changed by more than ten percent .",
    "some lines in the spectrum are blended with weaker lines . the cleanest way to handle this situation",
    "is to exclude the contaminated bins from the modelling .",
    "to test the effects of this , we eliminated 0.03  from the red wing of the 15.014  line and refit the data .",
    "we then repeated this experiment eliminating 0.07  - leaving only about two - thirds of the data . even in this second , extreme case , the fit parameters varied by less than ten percent and the confidence regions only expanded slightly .    for most lines ,",
    "the heg data is significantly weaker than the meg data .",
    "we find for the 15.014  line that including the heg data changes the best - fitting model parameters by , at most , a few percent , but it does tighten the confidence limits somewhat .",
    "the effect of including the heg data is more significant for the shorter wavelength lines , where the effective area of the heg is larger relative to the meg .",
    "there is very little penalty for including the heg data , so we do so for all lines shortward of 16  .",
    "we also fit the meg and heg data separately for the 15.014 line to verify that there are not systematic effects between these two spectra ; and there are not .",
    "the separate fits give results that are very similar to each other , with significantly overlapping 68 percent confidence limits for all parameters .",
    "the original @xcite line profile model allows for a radially varying filling factor of x - ray emitting plasma , parameterized as a power law function of radius .",
    "values of the power - law index , @xmath27 , that differ significantly from zero ( no radial variation ) can cause changes in the line profiles that are not insignificant , effectively weighting the emission from parts of the wind according to their velocity ( via the beta - velocity law relationship between velocity and radius ) .",
    "however , we find that when we allow @xmath27 to be a free parameter the best - fitting value is generally very close to zero . for the representative 15.014  line ,",
    "it is @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is included in the 68 percent confidence range .",
    "the general result is consistent with that found for this and other stars @xcite .",
    "thus , to keep the number of free parameters manageable , we fix @xmath32 .",
    "the factors discussed above have a very minor influence on the results of the line fitting .",
    "however , the remaining factors can have a significant effect .",
    "the velocity - law exponent , @xmath16 , affects line profiles for two reasons : ( 1 ) the velocity law affects the mapping between radius and doppler shifted wavelength , and so affects the emission profile ; and ( 2 ) via the continuity equation , it affects the density and so affects the level of both the emission and the absorption . indeed , for our representative emission line ,",
    "when we change the value of @xmath16 from 1 to 0.8 , both @xmath2 and @xmath23 change by 10 to 20 percent .",
    "the determinations of @xmath16 for @xmath0  pup vary from at least 0.9 to 1.15 , and so using a value of @xmath33 seems reasonable , especially as it speeds the calculation of the line profile model by allowing the optical depth integral to be done analytically , so we use that value for all the model fitting results reported here .",
    "if , in the future , a new and more accurate determination of @xmath16 is made , and it differs significantly from @xmath34 , then the results reported in this paper can be scaled accordingly from 1 to 0.8 causes the best - fitting optical depth of the fe xvii line at 15.014  to go from @xmath35 to @xmath36 .",
    "if the value of @xmath16 were to be revised upward by a similar amount , the values we derive for @xmath2 from the line profile fitting would have to be revised upward by about 15 percent .",
    "the quality of the fits with the different values of @xmath16 do not differ significantly . ] .",
    "we also note that the x - ray emitting plasma and the bulk wind that attenuates the x - rays may not necessarily be described by the same beta velocity law . however , there is no independent evidence for this , and with the short post - shock cooling lengths expected in the relatively dense wind of @xmath0  pup , the x - ray emitting plasma in the wind is more likely to have a velocity close to the ambient wind velocity . and furthermore , the observed x - ray emission line widths in @xmath0  pup and other early o supergiants are completely consistent with the @xmath16 and @xmath8 values inferred from uv and optical spectroscopy of these stars .",
    "the terminal velocity of @xmath0  pup is relatively well established , with reasonable estimates from several different groups that vary by about @xmath37 percent about our adopted value of 2250 km s@xmath12 .",
    "however , when we explored the effect of varying the terminal velocity in our fitting of wind profile models to the 15.014  line , we found that the value of @xmath2 was quite sensitive to the assumed wind terminal velocity , even within this relatively narrow range .",
    "this is because the blue shift of the line centroid in the dimensionless , scaled wavelength parameter , @xmath38 , depends directly on the degree of wind absorption .",
    "the same observed profile appears more blue shifted in scaled wavelength units if the terminal velocity is ( assumed to be ) smaller .",
    "our tests with the 15.014  line show that the best - fitting value for @xmath2 ranges from 2.16 to 1.35 when we use terminal velocities between 2200 km s@xmath12 and 2485 km s@xmath12 .",
    "this variation is larger than that caused by every other parameter uncertainty and assumption we have explored .",
    "thus , while we consider the value of @xmath39 km s@xmath12 to be quite reliable , future re - assessments of this parameter will necessitate a rescaling of the optical depth  and mass - loss rate ",
    "results we report in this paper .    as a final test",
    ", we can treat the terminal velocity as a free parameter of the model .",
    "this enables us to see what value of the terminal velocity is preferred by the x - ray spectral data themselves . in general , the constraints on @xmath8 , while letting the other model parameters be free to vary , were not strong . but for the highest signal - to - noise lines in the spectrum , relatively tight constraints could be derived .",
    "we show the results for fitting the five most useful lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : vinf_scatter ] .",
    "as the figure shows , these lines are all consistent with our adopted value of @xmath40 km s@xmath12 .",
    "this , of course , gives us added confidence that the value we use for the model fitting is reasonable . and ,",
    "in fact , the small error bars on most of these determinations also show that significantly smaller and larger values are ruled out .",

    "was allowed to be a free parameter ( the other parameters  @xmath2 , @xmath23 , and the normalization  were allowed to vary as well ) .",

    "the most obvious new and significant result of the profile model fitting is the wavelength trend in the derived values of the fiducial optical depth , @xmath2 , shown in the top panel of fig.[fig : scatter ] .",

    "the null hypothesis of a constant value of @xmath2 is rejected with greater than 99.9 percent confidence ( @xmath41 for 15 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "we therefore fit a model of wavelength - dependent @xmath2 , in which the wavelength dependence derives entirely from the atomic opacity , @xmath42 .",
    "while it may seem obvious that there should be a trend in the fiducial optical depth with wavelength , this result is quite significant , in that a presumed lack of such a trend is the basis for claims that large - scale clumping and the associated wind porosity are the cause of the smaller than expected profile blue shifts and asymmetry @xcite . in the following subsections ,",
    "we show how a realistic wind opacity model naturally explains the observed wavelength trend , and then how such a model can be used to make a quantitative determination of the mass - loss rate of @xmath0  pup .",

    "we present this model only for comparison with the sub - solar metallicity opacity model , and as a limiting high opacity case .",
    "derived from the line - profile model fits , shown as points with error bars ( same as the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : scatter ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath2 expected if the mass - loss rate is @xmath57 @xmath4 is shown as the upper dashed curve . treating the mass - loss rate as a free parameter",
    ", the best fit value of @xmath58 @xmath4 is shown as the lower , varying solid curve .",
    "this model provides a formally good fit . and both of these models of the wavelength - dependent @xmath2 use the sub - solar metallicity ( cmfgen ) opacity model .",
    "the horizontal dash - dot line is the best - fitting constant @xmath2 model , as would be expected for a highly porous wind , where the effective opacity is completely determined by the macroscopic , physical cross sections of the optically thick clumps . it does not provide a good fit to the data",
    ", width=302 ]     @xmath4 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mdot ] , is shown here again , but this time it is compared to the best - fitting solar abundance @xmath2 model ( dotted curve ) .",
    "the fits are of similar quality , while the solar abundance model has a lower mass - loss rate ( @xmath59 @xmath4 ) to compensate for its higher overall opacity . , width=302 ]    taking a closer look at the atomic opacity , we can see in the preceding three figures that the most leverage regarding the wavelength dependence of the opacity , and hence of @xmath2 , comes at the shortest wavelengths , below the ne k - shell edges near 13  .",
    "the fe and ne edges and the low o abundance conspire to make the opacity rather flatter than the generally expected @xmath60 relationship seen from individual elements photoionization cross sections .",
    "most of the strong lines in the meg spectra of o stars are between 12 and 18  , where the opacity is relatively constant .",
    "this demonstrates the need for the use of realistic wind opacity models when interpreting trends in grating spectra of o stars and explains why the wavelength trend of @xmath2 values was not noted in the initial studies .",
    "furthermore , the paucity of useful emission lines longward of the o k - shell edge makes it difficult to discriminate among various wind opacity models , although in principle , lines longward of this edge could enable us to diagnose the altered cno - processed abundances with some certainty . and emission lines longward of the n k - shell edge near 26  would be especially useful , but there are none in the _ chandra _ spectrum .",
    "the n vii ly@xmath16 line at 20.910  is quite weak and does not provide a strong constraint on @xmath2 , although it does favor the sub - solar metallicity opacity model . the longest wavelength line which we are able to reliably fit is the helium - like o vii complex near 21.8  .",
    "we fit the resonance and intercombination lines simultaneously ( the forbidden line is not present due to @xmath61 photoexcitation by the photospheric uv field ) , with the profile parameters @xmath2 and @xmath23 tied together for the two lines .",
    "however , the resonance line in this complex may be subject to resonance scattering @xcite  it may be optically thick to its own radiation ( as distinct from the effects of continuum opacity of the overlying wind that leads to the observed skewness and blue shifts in all of the line profiles ) .",
    "resonance scattering tends to make broadened , asymmetric , and blue shifted lines more symmetric , and thus the @xmath2 value we derive from fitting this complex may be underestimated .",
    "if this is the case , then this line complex too would favor the sub - solar metallicity wind opacity model , as shown in fig.[fig:2mdot ] .",
    "we also note that the only other line of the sixteen we analyze that is likely to be optically thick to resonance scattering is the o vii @xmath15 line at 18.969  , so the @xmath2 determination for that line may also be somewhat underestimated .",
    "we also can see from a careful inspection of the opacity model that the mass - loss rate determination from fitting a set of @xmath2 values is mostly sensitive to the cross section contributions from n , o , and fe .",
    "alterations of o and n abundances due to cno processing will have only a modest effect on the results , however .",
    "the sum of the contributions of n and o ( as well as he and c ) is what affects the overall opacity level between about 15  and 20  , with fe  and to a lesser extent , ne  making a significant contribution at shorter wavelengths .",
    "this demonstrates that accurate determinations of abundances for o stars are perhaps the biggest factor in enabling the determination of clumping - independent mass - loss rates from high - resolution x - ray spectra .",
    "but when fitting a large ensemble of lines that span a relatively wide range of wavelengths , knowing the overall metallicity is probably sufficient , although including a realistic mixture of elements ( and thus absorption edges ) is important too .",
    "the uncertainty in the mass - loss rate determination we have found from the fits to the ensemble of @xmath2 values , derived from fitting the individual line profiles , come from three sources .",
    "the first is the formal uncertainty on the mass - loss rate model that stems from the uncertainties on the individual line profile fits ( represented by the error bars on the @xmath2 points in fig .",
    "[ fig : mdot ] , for example ) . for the sub - solar metallicity opacity model the 68 percent confidence limit range on the fitted mass - loss rate extends from @xmath62 to @xmath63 @xmath4 , representing an uncertainty of a little less than 10 percent on the best - fitting value of @xmath64 @xmath4 .",
    "the second source of uncertainty arises from our imperfect knowledge of the wind terminal velocity ( and , most importantly , the terminal velocity of the x - ray emitting plasma itself ) .",
    "however , as we have shown ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : vinf_scatter ] ) , the data themselves indicate that our adopted terminal velocity of @xmath39 km s@xmath12 is well supported .",
    "three of the lines we show in that figure have best - fitting terminal velocity values near 2350 km s@xmath12 , which is also the terminal velocity derived from a careful analysis of the uv line profiles by @xcite .",
    "when we refit the representative fe xvii line at 15.014  using this higher terminal velocity , we found a reduction in our derived @xmath2 value of 15 percent .",
    "if this scaling holds for all lines , then using this slightly higher value of the terminal velocity will lead to a downward revision of our derived mass - loss rate of about 15 percent .",
    "( note that the terminal velocity enters into the denominator of the expression for @xmath2 , and that will mitigate this adjustment slightly . )",
    "similar considerations pertain to our assumption about the wind velocity parameter , @xmath16 .",
    "the third , and largest , source of uncertainty is due to the abundances .",
    "we estimate that the abundances derived for @xmath0  pup from the analysis of uv and optical data have a precision of only about a factor of two @xcite .",
    "however , we note that they are in good agreement with the independent , x - ray - based determination from @xcite , providing additional confidence as to their accuracy .",
    "we can see from the comparison of the sub - solar metallicity model to the solar abundance model that the mass - loss rate varies by about a factor of two between these two assumed opacity models , although the solar abundance model is included in our analysis not so much as a realistic alternate model , but simply as a plausible upper bound to the atomic opacity ; the sub - solar metallicity model is more realistic due to the constraints on it provided by observations in other wavelength bands @xcite , and of course , the evolved nature of @xmath0  pup implies that we should not expect to find solar abundances in its wind . however , the overall cno metallicity of 0.53 solar is lower than expected , given the uniformly solar abundances in nearby massive stars @xcite .",
    "thus , a conservative estimate of the allowed range of the mass - loss rate of @xmath0  pup derived from the x - ray line profile fitting is roughly 2 to @xmath65 @xmath4 , with our best estimate being @xmath66 @xmath4 .",
    "this mass - loss rate is only a little lower than the maximum mass - loss rate of @xmath67 @xmath4 @xcite , implying a small amount of clumping in the outer wind , and a small adjustment to the clumping factor in the inner wind determined by @xcite .",
    "any future modification to the accepted abundances of @xmath0  pup could lead to a change in the mass - loss rate implied by our x - ray line profile analysis . to a good approximation",
    ", such a change would simply involve scaling the x - ray line profile mass - loss rate by the reciprocal of the change in the overall metallicity , for reasons discussed at the end of the previous subsection .",
    "the analysis of the sixteen lines and line complexes in the _ chandra _ spectrum of @xmath0  pup also enables us to derive values of the onset radius of the wind - shock x - ray emission from the profiles .",
    "these results are shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : scatter ] , and are completely consistent with the expectations of the wind - shock structure induced by the line - driven instability @xcite . that is , an onset radius of @xmath68 @xmath7 ( from a weighted fit to the results from the sixteen fitted lines and line complexes ; with an uncertainty of 0.1 @xmath7 ) .",
    "we have searched for a trend with wavelength in these values and found none .",
    "thus , the simplest interpretation is that there is a universal radius of the onset of x - ray emission and it occurs near 1.5 @xmath7 ( half a stellar radius above the photosphere ) .",
    "this result had already been noted by @xcite , though we show it more robustly here .",
    "this same result can also be seen in the late o supergiant @xmath0  ori @xcite . and",
    "this result is also consistent with the joint analysis of x - ray line profile shapes and helium - like forbidden - to - intercombination line ratios for four o stars as described by @xcite .",
    "finally , let us consider why we have found a trend in wavelength for the fiducial optical depth values , @xmath2 , derived from the same _ chandra _ data that led @xcite to report that there was no obvious trend .",
    "the two biggest factors leading to this new result are our more careful assessment of line blends , and our inclusion of many weak , but important , lines at short wavelength .",
    "@xcite included only one line shortward of the ne x @xmath15 line at 12.134  , whereas we report on nine lines or line complexes in this range ( including two helium - like complexes , which @xcite excluded from their analysis ) . while many of these lines are weak and do not provide very strong constraints when considered individually , taken together , they are highly statistically significant . as for line blends ,",
    "@xcite included the n vii @xmath15 line at 24.781  and the fe xvii complex near 15.26  , both of which we have determined are too blended to allow the extraction of reliable information about their intrinsic profile shapes .",
    "furthermore , we properly account for the blended fe xvii lines at 17.051 and 17.096  , fitting them simultaneously , while @xcite fit them as a single line .    nonetheless , if we exclude the blended 17.05 , 17.10  lines , our @xmath2 values for each line also analyzed by @xcite are in agreement to within the error bars .",
    "similarly , for five unblended lines in the analysis of the same data by @xcite , we find consistent results .",
    "in fact , the wavelength trend of @xmath2 is fully consistent with the @xmath2 values found by @xcite , but there were not enough lines in that study for the trend to be unambiguously detected .",
    "the seven additional lines and line complexes that are not analyzed in any other study @xcite but which we analyze here are crucial for mapping out the wavelength dependence of @xmath2 .",
    "an additional factor that enabled us to determine that the wavelength trend in @xmath2 is consistent with that expected from the form of the atomic opacity of the wind is our use of a detailed model of the wind opacity .",
    "it is relatively flat over much of the wavelength range encompassing the strong lines in the _ chandra _ spectrum .",
    "specifically , from about 12  to about 18  , the presence of successive ionization edges makes the overall opacity roughly flat .",
    "thus , for a trend to be apparent , short wavelength lines have to be included in the analysis .",
    "previous studies have computed wind x - ray opacities  several based on detailed non - lte wind modeling  and used them for the analysis of x - ray spectra @xcite .",
    "but the present study is the first to demonstrate the importance of the combined effect of multiple edges in flattening the opacity in the middle of the _ chandra _ bandpass . and",
    "it is the first to explore the sensitivity of the fitting of a high - resolution x - ray spectrum to the assumed wind opacity .",
    "finally , the mass - loss rate reduction derived here is only a little less than a factor of three , while earlier analyses suggested that , without porosity , much larger mass - loss rate reductions would be required to explain the only modestly shifted and asymmetric profiles @xcite . here too , the wind opacity is key .",
    "the overall opacity of the wind is significantly lower than had been previously assumed , implying that the mass - loss rate reduction is not as great than had been assumed .",
    "again , this is primarily due to the significantly sub - solar abundances ( especially of oxygen ) in @xmath0  pup .",
    "by quantitatively analyzing all the x - ray line profiles in the _ chandra _ spectrum , we have determined a mass - loss rate of @xmath69 @xmath4 , with a confidence range of @xmath70 to @xmath71 @xmath4 . within the context of the simple , spherically symmetric wind emission and absorption model",
    "we employ , the largest uncertainty arises from the abundances used in the atomic opacity model .",
    "this method of mass - loss rate determination from x - ray profiles is a potentially powerful tool for addressing the important issue of the actual mass - loss rates of o stars .",
    "care must be taken in the profile analysis , however , as well as in the interpretation of the trends found in the derived @xmath2 values .",
    "it is especially important to use a realistic model of the wind opacity . and for o stars with weaker winds , especially , it will be important to verify that the x - ray profiles are consistent with the overall paradigm of embedded wind shocks . here , an independent determination of the terminal velocity of the x - ray emitting plasma by analyzing the widths and profiles of the observed x - ray lines themselves will be crucial . in the case of @xmath0  pup",
    ", we have shown that the x - ray profiles are in fact consistent with the same wind kinematics seen in uv absorption line spectra of the bulk wind . and",
    "the profile analysis also strongly constrains the onset radius of x - ray production to be about @xmath72 @xmath7 .",
    "an additional conclusion from the profile analysis is that there is no need to invoke large scale porosity to explain individual line profiles , as the overall wavelength trend is completely consistent ( within the measurement errors ) with the wavelength - dependence of the atomic opacity .",
    "the lower - than - expected wind optical depths are simply due to a reduction in the wind mass - loss rate .",
    "this modest reduction is consistent with other recent determinations that account for the effect of small - scale clumping on density - squared diagnostics and ionization corrections @xcite .",
