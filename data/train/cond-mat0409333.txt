    "the spin - injection from a metal into a semiconductor remains one of the main challenges in the field of magnetoelectonics.@xcite the use of half - metallic ferromagnets as electrodes was proposed to maximize the efficiency of spintronic devices .",
    "these compounds are ferromagnetic metals with a band gap at the fermi level ( @xmath2 ) for the minority spin band leading to 100% spin - polarization at @xmath2 .",
    "but even in this case , interface states at the contact between the half - metal and the semiconductor can destroy the half - metallicity . due to their orthogonality to all bulk states incident to the interface , in the ballistic limit these states should not affect the transport properties , but it is their interaction with other defect states which makes them conducting .",
    "the first material predicted to be a half - metal is the heusler alloy nimnsb.@xcite there exist several ab - initio calculations on nimnsb reproducing the initial results of de groot and collaborators,@xcite and galanakis _ et al .",
    "_ showed that the gap arises from the hybridization between the @xmath0 orbitals of the ni and mn atoms.@xcite experiments seem to well establish its half - metallicity in the case of single crystals,@xcite but in films the half - metallicity is lost.@xcite theoretical calculations for the interfaces of these materials with the semiconductors are few and all results agree that in general the half - metallicity is lost at the interface between the heusler alloy and the semiconductor.@xcite wijs and de groot have argued than in the case of the nimnsb / cds ( 111 ) contacts the sb / s interface keeps the half - metallicity ( or at least shows a very high degree of spin - polarization ) of the bulk nimnsb.@xcite thus , even if half - metallicity is lost , it is possible that a high degree of spin - polarization stays at the interface and these structures remain attractive for realistic applications .    we should also mention that even in the absence of the interface states true half - metallicity can not really exist due to minority states induced by the spin - orbit coupling which couples the two spin - bands .",
    "but as it was shown for these systems in refs .",
    "and this phenomenon is very weak and instead of a gap in the minority channel there is a region of still almost 100% spin - polarization .",
    "it was also found that the orbital moments are very small in these compounds.@xcite thus , spin - orbit coupling can be assumed to be negligible with respect to the interface states .    in this communication",
    "we study the ( 001 ) interfaces of the half - metallic nimnsb heusler alloy with inp and gaas and the ( 111 ) interface between the nimnsb and inp compounds .",
    "we take into account all possible contacts and show that there are cases where a high degree of spin - polarization remains at the interface . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we discuss the structure of the interfaces and the computational details and in section [ sec3 ] we present and analyze our results for the ( 001 ) interfaces . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we discuss the ( 111 ) interfaces and finally in section [ sec5 ] we summarize and conclude .",
    "in the calculations we used two different full - potential methods .",
    "firstly we employed the full - potential version of the screened korringa - kohn - rostoker ( fskkr ) green s function method@xcite in conjunction with the local spin - density approximation ( lda)@xcite to the density functional theory@xcite to study the ( 001 ) interfaces between nimnsb and the inp and gaas semiconductors .",
    "the fskkr method scales linearly with the number of atoms and , therefore , allows to study also very thick slabs of these materials .",
    "but it can not give exactly the fermi level of semiconductors due to problems arising from the @xmath3 cut - off in this method@xcite and , thus , we employed also the full - potential linearized augmented plane - wave method ( flapw)@xcite in the fleur implementation@xcite to calculate the nimnsb / inp(001 ) interfaces in order to compute the band offset .",
    "finally , the flapw method was also employed in the case of the nimnsb / inp(111 ) interfaces .",
    "nimnsb crystallizes in the @xmath4 structure , which consists of four interpenetrating fcc sublattices .",
    "the unit cell is that of a fcc lattice with four atoms as basis at a=@xmath5 , b=@xmath6 , c= @xmath7 and d=@xmath8 in wyckoff coordinates.@xcite in the case of nimnsb the a site is occupied by ni , the b site by mn and the d site by sb , while the c site is unoccupied . the @xmath4 structure is similar to the @xmath9 structure adopted by the full heusler alloys , like ni@xmath10mnsb where also the c site is occupied by a ni atom.@xcite the zincblende structure , adopted by a large number of semiconductors like gaas and inp , can also be considered as consisting of four fcc sublattices . in the case of gaas",
    "the a site is occupied by a ga atom , the b site by an as atom , while the c and d sites are empty .",
    "depending on the electronic structure method used to perform the calculations one either uses empty spheres or empty polyhedra to account for the vacant sites ( as it is done in the fskkr ) or the vacant sites just make part of the interstitial region ( as in flapw ) . within 1% accuracy nimnsb ( 5.91 )",
    "has the same experimental lattice constant as inp ( 5.87 ) and epitaxial growth of nimnsb on top of inp has been already achieved experimentally by molecular beam epitaxy.@xcite on the other hand , the lattice constant of gaas ( 5.65 ) is almost 4% smaller .",
    "the dominant effect at the interface is the expansion or the contraction of the lattice of the half metal along the growth axis to account for the in - plane change of its lattice parameter.@xcite since in the case of the nimnsb / inp interface both compounds have similar lattice parameters , in the calculations perfect epitaxy can be assumed .    within the fskkr",
    "the space is divided into non - overlapping wigner - seitz polyhedra and thus empty ones are needed to describe accurately the vacant sites ( similarly to the use of empty spheres in the early electronic structure methods ) . to simulate the ( 001 ) interface within the fskkr calculations we used a multilayer consisting of 15 layers of the half - metal and 9 semiconductor layers .",
    "this thickness is enough so that the layers in the middle of both the half - metallic part and the semiconducting one exhibit bulk properties .",
    "there are several combinations at the interface , e.g.  at the nimnsb / inp contact the interface can be either a ni / in one , ni / p , mnsb / in or mnsb / p ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we will keep this definition through out the paper to denote different interfaces .",
    "we should also mention that since the multilayer contains 15 half - metal and 9 semiconductor layers , there are two equivalent surfaces at both sides of the half - metallic spacer .",
    "finally , for our fskkr calculations we used a 20@xmath1120@xmath114 grid in the * k*-space and we took into account wavefunctions up to @xmath3=3 and thus the potential and the charge density were expanded on lattice harmonics up to @xmath3=6 .",
    "all fskkr calculations have been performed at the experimental lattice constant of nimnsb ( 5.91 ) .",
    "schematic representation of the ( 001 ) interface between nimnsb and inp .",
    "there are several different combinations at the interface which can be either ni / in , ni / p , mnsb / in ( shown in the figure ) or mnsb / p . ]    in the flapw method the space is divided into non - overlapping muffin - tin spheres around each atom and an interstitial region , that is described in terms of plane - waves . to perform the calculations for the ( 001 ) interfaces we employed a repeated slab made up of 8 layers of nimnsb and 8 layers of the semiconductor .",
    "thus if the one contact is ni / p the other one is mnsb / in . as will be shown in subsection [ sec3 - 3 ] , the smaller number of layers ( as compared to the fskkr calculations ) does not influence the properties near the fermi level . for the ( 111 ) interfaces the supercells consisted of 16 layers of nimnsb and 12 layers of inp .",
    "the flapw calculations were performed using density functional theory in the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) as given by perdew et al.@xcite for the calculations , a planewave cutoff @xmath12 of 3.45  a.u.@xmath13 was used .",
    "lattice harmonics with angular momentum @xmath14 were used to expand the charge density and the wavefunctions within the muffin - tin spheres , having a radius of 2.4  a.u .",
    "for sb and 2.34  a.u .",
    "for all the other atoms .",
    "the brillouin - zone ( bz ) was sampled with 128 special * k*-points in the irreducible wedge ( 1/8 of the whole bz ) for ( 001 ) interfaces , and 90 * k*-points in the irreducible wedge ( 1/12 of the whole bz ) for the ( 111 ) interfaces .",
    "all flapw calculations were performed at the experimental lattice constant of inp ( 5.87   ) .",
    "compared to simple surfaces , interfaces are more complex systems due the hybridization between the orbitals of the atoms of the metallic alloy and the semiconductor at the interface .",
    "thus , results obtained for the surfaces ( as the ones in refs .   and ) can not be easily generalized for interfaces since for different semiconductors different phenomena can occur . in both ( 001 ) and ( 111 ) surfaces of nimnsb",
    ", the appearance of surface states destroys the half - metallicity.@xcite in sections [ sec3 - 1 ] and [ sec3 - 2 ] we present the fskkr results for the nimnsb / inp(001 ) and nimnsb / gaas(001 ) contacts , respectively , and in section [ sec3 - 3 ] we give the valence band offsets calculated with the flapw method for the nimnsb / inp(001 ) interfaces and compare the results obtained with the two different methods .    .",

    "the mn spin moment decreases considerably and is now 3.4 @xmath15 compared to the bulk value of 3.7 @xmath15 . for the p terminated inp film the spin moment of mn at the interface is very close to the bulk value . in the case of the bulk nimnsb the minority gap is created by the hybridization between the @xmath0-orbitals of the ni and mn atoms , but the sb atom plays also a crucial role since it provides states lower in energy than the @xmath0 bands which accommodate electrons of the transition metal atoms.@xcite moreover mn and ni atoms create a common majority band where there is a charge transfer from the mn atoms towards the ni ones . on the mnsb terminated surface",
    "each mn atom loses 2 out of its 4 nearest ni atoms and regains this charge which fills up mainly majority states .",
    "the mn spin moment at the surface is strongly enhanced reaching 4.0 @xmath15 . in the case of the interfaces ,",
    "the final spin moment of the mn atom at the interface depends on the hybridization with the neighboring atoms of the semiconductor . at an in interface , the mn minority @xmath0-states hybridize strongly with the in states and thus the mn spin moment is severely reduced and in shows a negative induced spin moment . in the case of p , the situation is reversed and p has a positive induced spin moment .",
    "the mn-@xmath0 - p-@xmath1 hybridization is not as strong as the mn-@xmath0 - in-@xmath1 one and the mn spin moment at the interface is close to the bulk value .",
    "we should also note that , if we move deeper into the half - metallic film , the spin moments regain their bulklike behavior while , if we move deeper in the semiconductor film , the induced spin moments quickly vanish .",
    "atom- and spin - resolved dos for the case of mnsb / p ( dashed line ) and ni / p ( solid line ) contacts for the two interface layers and one layer deeper in the half - metal and the semiconductor .",
    "the zero of the energy is chosen to correspond to the fermi level .",
    "positive values of the dos correspond to the majority spin and negative to the minority . ]    on a mnsb - terminated ( 001 ) surface the spin polarization at the fermi level , @xmath2 , was found to be as high as 38% ( the spin - polarization is defined with respect to the density of states",

    "two surface states at @xmath2 were reported to destroy the half - metallicity , but still the population of the majority electrons at the fermi level was twice as large as the one of the minority states . compared to this surface , for the interfaces between mnsb - terminated nimnsb and inp the situation is completely different .",
    "the hybridization between the @xmath0-states of mn and @xmath1-states of sb with the @xmath1-states of either the in or the p atom at the interface is such that the net polarization at the interface is almost zero .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] where we present with the dashed line the spin and atom resolved density of states ( dos ) of the atoms at the interface for a mnsb / p contact .",
    "there is a minority interface state pinned at the fermi level which destroys the half - metallicity . in the mn local dos , this state overlaps with the unoccupied minority mn states and it is not easily distinguished but its existence is obvious if one examines the ni and sb dos .",
    "the situation is similar also for the mnsb / in contact not shown here .",
    "bottom : spin and atom - resolved dos for the ni and `` void '' atoms at the interface with in ( dashed line ) or p ( solid line ) .",

    "]    in the case of the ni terminated nimnsb films , dos at @xmath2 is more bulklike than the case of the mnsb films .",
    "already ni interface atom has a spin moment of 0.29 @xmath15 in the case of an interface with in and 0.36 @xmath15 for an interface with p compared to the bulk value of 0.26 @xmath15 . in the bulk case ni has 4 mn and 4 sb atoms as first neighbors . on the ni - terminated ( 001 ) surface",
    "the ni atom loses half of its first neighbors .",
    "but if an interface with p is formed , the nickels two lost sb neighbors are replaced by two isovalent p atoms and  with the exception of the mn neighbors  the situation is very similar to the bulk . now",
    "the sb @xmath1 bands at lower energy are not destroyed since p has a behavior similar to sb and still they accommodate three transition metal @xmath0 electrons .",
    "thus the only change in the dos comes from the missing two mn neighboring atoms .",
    "the dos in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for the ni / p case is clearly very close to the bulk case and in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we have gathered the dos for the ni and the void at the interface and the mn and sb atoms at the subinterface layer for both ni / in ( dashed line ) and ni / p ( solid line ) contacts and we compare them with the bulk results from ref . .",

    "it was shown that in the case of the ni / p interfaces the spin - polarization was as high as 39% . in order to investigate whether this is a general result for all semiconductors or specifically for this interface we also performed calculations for the case of the nimnsb / gaas(001 ) contacts using the same lattice parameter as for the previous ones ;",
    "thus the lattice constant of gaas was expanded by approximately 4% .     left - top panel : atom- and spin - resolved dos for the case of mnsb / in ( dashed line ) and mnsb / p ( solid line ) contacts for the mn atom at the interface layer .",

    "the hybridization between the @xmath0-orbitals of the mn atom at the interface and the @xmath1-orbitals of the @xmath24 atoms of the semiconductor is larger in the case of the gaas than for the inp spacer .",
    "this leads to an about 0.1 - 0.2 @xmath15 smaller mn spin moments at the interface and the exchange splitting between the occupied mn majority and the unoccupied mn minority @xmath0-states is smaller .",
    "thus the large minority peak above the fermi level moves lower in energy and now strongly overlaps with the occupied minority peak below the fermi level increasing the minority dos at the fermi level . in the meantime",
    "the smaller exchange splitting causes the shift of the occupied mn majority states towards higher energies enhancing also the mn majority dos at the fermi level .",
    "the final spin - polarization at the fermi level in the case of the mnsb / ga or as contacts is similar to the mnsb / in and mnsb / p ones and these interfaces are not interesting for real applications .",
    "the same effect occurring for the mnsb interface can also be seen at the ni interfaces , as shown in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "the stronger hybridization of the ni atom with either the ga or as atoms at the interface with respect to the inp semiconductor provokes a movement of the ni unoccupied minority @xmath0 states towards lower energies while the occupied majority ones are moving higher in energy .",
    "if one looks in detail at the ni / in and ni / ga contacts , one observes that the minority peak at the fermi level present in the ni / in contact is now smeared out in the case of the ni / ga contact due to the unoccupied minority states which move lower in energy .",
    "similarly the unoccupied ni minority @xmath0-states have a larger bandwidth in the case of the ni / as contact than in the case of the ni / p one inducing a high minority ni dos at the fermi level . the high spin - polarization at the fermi level presented in the case of the ni / p interfaces is completely destroyed in the case of the ni / as contact due to the larger hybridization between the ni-@xmath0 and as-@xmath1 orbitals with respect to the hybridization between the ni-@xmath0 and p-@xmath1 orbitals .",
    "thus , the properties of the interface depend also in a large extent on the choice of the semiconductor .     left panel : atom- and spin - resolved dos for the case of mnsb / in(001 ) ( dashed line ) and mnsb / p(001 ) ( solid line ) contacts for the mn atom at the interface layer as calculated with the flapw method .",

    "the thin solid line indicates the local dos of bulk nimnsb . ]      employing the flapw method , we calculated the ( minority states ) valence - band offset which is the energy difference between the maximum of the valence band ( vbm ) of the semiconductor and the maximum of the minority valence band of the heusler alloy . to calculate it we referenced the binding energies the core states in the interface calculation to their corresponding bulk values as described in ref .  .",
    "we found that the vbm of the semiconductor is 0.83 ev lower than the one of the half - metal for the in / mnsb contact .",
    "for the other interfaces the valence band offsets are : 0.69 ev for the in / ni , 0.69 for the p / ni and 0.80 ev for the p / mnsb contact . in the bulk inp",
    "semiconductor the experimental gap is 1.6 ev , thus the fermi level , which is 0.07 ev above the maximum of the minority nimnsb valence band falls in the middle of the semiconductor bulk bandgap .",
    "this is similar to what is happening also in the case of the co@xmath10mnge / gaas ( 001 ) interfaces  @xcite and these junctions can be used to inject spin - polarized electrons in the semiconductor .",
    "we can now also compare the results obtained with the flapw with the results from the fskkr calculations . in the left panel of fig .",

    "we should also mention that , although the induced majority dos at the fermi level for the p atom at the interface seems very large ( it is of the same order of magnitude with the ni one ) , when we move away from the fermi level it becomes very small compared to the majority dos of the transition - metal atoms .",

    "[ fig9 ] we have gathered the layer - resolved dos for the two different p / sb interfaces and in this figure we also included the atomic spin moments .",
    "the sb spin moments are @xmath26 for the ... -in - p / sb - mn - ni- ... interface and @xmath27 for the ... -in - p / sb - ni - mn- ... interface , in both cases this is smaller than the bulk value of @xmath28 .",

    "[ fig9 ] , the contrary effect occurs . in the second case",
    "the mn is deeper in the interface and its environment is more bulklike and the minority states are pinned at their position and thus the the fermi level falls within a minority local minimum resulting in a very high spin - polarization . at the ...",

    ", the larger hybridization of the mn minority states ( not only with the @xmath1-orbitals of sb but also with the ones of @xmath22 , since the last ones are closer now ) obliges the minority states to move slightly lower in energy .",
    "thus , the fermi level does not fall in the local minimum but shifts into the peak of the unoccupied minority states and the net spin - polarization vanishes .",
    "the ni states are strongly polarized by the mn ones and also in the case of the ni atom which is deeper than the mn one , the fermi level does not fall anymore within the local minimum .    similarly to the ( 001 ) interfaces in section [ sec3 - 3 ] , we also calculated the band - offset in the case of the ( 111 ) interfaces .",

    "in the first part of our study we investigated the electronic and magnetic properties of the ( 001 ) interfaces between the half - metal nimnsb and the binary semiconductors inp and gaas using two different full - potential _ ab - initio _ techniques . both methods gave similar results in the case of the nimnsb / inp(001 ) contacts .",
    "in all cases the ( 001 ) interfaces lose the half - metallicity but in the case of the ni / p contact the ni has a bulk like behavior since the p atoms substitute the cut - off sb isovalent neighbors and 70% of the electrons are of majority - spin character at the fermi level .",
    "but in the case of the ni / as interface the large hybridization at the interface suppresses this high spin - polarization .",
    "mnsb - terminated interfaces , on the other hand , present very intense interface states which penetrate also into the deeper layers of the nimnsb film .    in the second part of our study we investigated all the possible ( 111 ) interfaces between nimnsb and inp . in",

    "although half - metallicity at the interfaces is in general lost , there are few contacts in which a high spin - polarization remains , that makes them attractive for realistic applications .",
    "interface states are important because the interaction with defects makes them conducting and lowers the efficiency of devices based on spin - injection .",
