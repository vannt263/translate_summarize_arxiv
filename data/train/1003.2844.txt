    "significance of @xmath0-@xmath1 coupling effect in binding mechanism of light @xmath0-hypernuclei has long been recognized and discussed in the references @xcite .",
    "admixture of @xmath1 states in @xmath0-hypernuclei is probably an important aspect of hypernuclear dynamics .",
    "there are two coupling schemes namely incoherent and coherent @xmath0-@xmath1 couplings @xcite .",
    "incoherent @xmath0-@xmath1 coupling means a nucleon changes to an excited level after the interaction , while the other process where a nucleon remains in its ground state after converting @xmath0 to @xmath1 , is called coherent @xmath0-@xmath1 coupling . in the latter case ,",
    "all the nucleons have an equal chance to interact with the converted @xmath1 and coupling effect contributed from each nucleon is added coherently .",
    "harada @xcite has successfully fitted the experimental spectra of @xmath14he ( stopped @xmath15 ) @xcite and @xmath14he ( in - flight @xmath16 @xcite production reactions by taking into account the coherent @xmath0-@xmath1 coupling effect .",
    "furthermore , all the s - shell @xmath0 hypernuclear binding energies are well reproduced only after the coherent @xmath0-@xmath1 coupling effect has been included @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the coherent coupling contribution is significantly large on the order of 1 mev in @xmath17h and @xmath17he ground states .",
    "having considered the above mentioned findings , we analyze a structure of @xmath18he in continuum by using three - body model of @xmath0-@xmath3-@xmath3 , @xmath19-@xmath3-@xmath3 and @xmath20-@xmath21-@xmath3 coupled channels to investigate the coherent @xmath0-@xmath1 coupling effect .",
    "the coupling between @xmath22-@xmath23 gives coherent @xmath0-@xmath1 coupling , while lane term of @xmath23-@xmath24 coupling plays a significant role in forming @xmath25h @xcite .",
    "all these couplings are included in our analysis . to solve three - body calculation",
    ", we employ kamimura s coupled rearrangement - channel method @xcite .",
    "three - body hamiltonian of the @xmath0-@xmath3-@xmath3 diagonal part , which we explicitly show for explanation here , is @xmath26 where @xmath27 expresses pauli exclusion effect between two tritons . in orthogonality - condition model ( ocm )",
    "@xcite , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the pauli forbidden state .",
    "total wave function of the @xmath0-@xmath3-@xmath3 channel is expanded in gaussian bases which are spanned over three rearrangement - channels as follows , @xmath30 wave functions of the other channels @xmath19-@xmath3-@xmath3 and @xmath20-@xmath21-@xmath3 are treated in a similar way .",
    "@xmath31-@xmath32 & @xmath33-@xmath34 & @xmath31-@xmath34 & @xmath35-@xmath32 & @xmath36-@xmath34 & @xmath37-@xmath34    1 & 1.7284 & 9.4720 & -3.5575 & 0.36869 & 1.9558 & -0.16822 2 & 50.838 & 69.234 & 4.2647 & 43.237 & 65.877 & 7.1105 3 & -63.595 & -105.09 & 32.682 & -57.877 & -44.391 & 0.70109 4 & 6.2861 & 10.130 & -4.0631 & 5.1858 & 2.1056 & -1.3503 5 & -1.1202 & -2.3001 & 0.8537 & -0.86971 & -0.61958 & 0.12653    the @xmath9 interaction used in our computations is a phase equivalent potential of the nijmegen model - d @xmath9 potential @xcite .",
    "then , hyperon - trinucleon potentials are obtained by folding the effective interaction , i.e. @xmath8-matrix of the above @xmath9 potential with trinucleon density distributions @xcite .",
    "they are expressed in five - range gaussian form , the range and strength parameters of which are slightly modified so as to reproduce the empirical @xmath0 binding energy of @xmath17h(0@xmath38 and @xmath17h(1@xmath38 , and the expansion coefficients for @xmath39 are given in table [ int ] .",
    "trinucleon - trinucleon ( @xmath4-@xmath4 ) interaction is obtained by doubly folding @xmath8-matrix of tamagaki s opeg @xmath10 potential with trinucleon density distributions .",
    "this @xmath4-@xmath4 potential is spin - isospin dependent , and does not give any bound state of triton - triton two - body system in ocm treatment .",
    "from our calculation , a bound state is found to be at @xmath40 mev below the @xmath41 threshold and about @xmath42 mev above the @xmath11he@xmath43 threshold as shown in fig . [ level ] .",
    "it is a feshbach resonance state @xcite , because it lies in continuum region of the open channels such as @xmath11he@xmath43 , @xmath44he@xmath45 , @xmath46he@xmath47 and @xmath48 channels .",
    "a possible way to populate this resonance state , @xmath18he@xmath49 , is through @xmath13 electro - production reaction on @xmath12li target .",
    "formation of @xmath18he@xmath49 through the @xmath50 resonance is described with @xmath51-channel interaction model as shown in fig .",
    "[ react ] .",
    "formation and decay spectra are analyzed , as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , by using yamaguchi - type separable ( i.e. @xmath51-channel ) potential : @xmath52 where @xmath53h@xmath54he .",
    "missing - mass spectrum and invariant - mass spectrum can be obtained by detecting emitted particles @xmath57 and @xmath58 and decay particle @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the effect of interaction range on the missing - mass spectrum is investigated by varying the range parameter of @xmath17h-@xmath3 interaction from 0.3 to 0.9 fm .",
    "figure [ spect ] shows the missing - mass spectrum calculated with 3 mev width of the @xmath50 resonance .",
    "we have compared this missing - mass spectrum with jlab experimental spectrum @xcite , where a peak structure is found at about 7 mev above the @xmath11he+@xmath0 threshold , which might correspond to our resonance state .",
    "a crude explanation of why a narrow peak appears in continuum region is such that ; similarity in structures between @xmath59-@xmath3 and @xmath3-@xmath3 may give a strong population of @xmath50 state , while different structures between @xmath3-@xmath3 and @xmath11he ensure the formation of quasi - stable feshbach resonance .",
    "however , a recent experimental spectrum of @xmath12li  @xmath60he displays only a prominent peak below the @xmath11he+@xmath0 threshold in bound region @xcite . in order to clarify the possible existence of feshbach resonance in @xmath18he system , electro - production or equivalent experiments on @xmath12li target with high statistics",
    "are highly awaited .",
