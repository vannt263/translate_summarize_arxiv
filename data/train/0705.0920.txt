    "the wiener amalgam spaces were introduced by feichtinger @xcite in 1980 and soon they revealed to be , together with the closely related modulation spaces , the natural framework for the time - frequency analysis ; see e.g. @xcite and grchenig s book @xcite .",
    "these spaces are modeled on the @xmath1 spaces but they turn out to be much more flexible , since they control the local regularity of a function and its decay at infinity separately . for example , the wiener amalgam space @xmath2 , @xmath3 or @xmath4 etc .",
    ", consists of functions which locally have the regularity of a function in @xmath5 but globally display a @xmath6 decay .    in this paper",
    "we focus our attention on the action of the metaplectic representation on wiener amalgam spaces .",
    "the metaplectic representation @xmath7 of the symplectic group @xmath8 ( see the subsequent section 2 and @xcite for details ) , was first constructed by segal and shale @xcite in the framework of quantum mechanics ( though on the algebra level the first construction is due to van hove @xcite ) and by weil @xcite in number theory . since then",
    ", the metaplectic representation has attracted the attention of many people in different fields of mathematics and physics . in particular",
    ", we highlight the applications in the framework of reproducing formulae and wavelet theory @xcite , frame theory @xcite , quantum mechanics @xcite and pde s @xcite .",
    "fix a test function @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "then , the _ wiener amalgam space _ @xmath11 with local component @xmath12 and global component @xmath6 is defined as the space of all functions / tempered distributions such that @xmath13 where @xmath14 . to give a flavor of the type of results : 0.3truecm _ if @xmath15 and @xmath16 , with @xmath17 , then the metaplectic operator @xmath18 is a continuous mapping from @xmath19 into @xmath11 , that is @xmath20 _ the norm upper bound @xmath21 is explicitly expressed in terms of the matrix @xmath22 and the indices @xmath23 ( see theorems [ t1 ] and [ ttt1 ] ) .",

    "0.3truecm    indeed , the fourier transform @xmath24 is a special metaplectic operator .",
    "if we introduce the symplectic matrix @xmath25 then @xmath24 is ( up to a phase factor ) the unitary metaplectic operator corresponding to @xmath26 , @xmath27    a fundamental tool to achieve these estimates is represented by the analysis of the dilation operator @xmath28 , for a real invertible @xmath29 matrix @xmath30 , with bounds on its norm in terms of spectral invariants of @xmath31 . in the framework of modulation spaces such an investigation was recently developed in the scalar case @xmath32 by sugimoto and tomita @xcite . in section 3",
    "we study this problem for a general matrix @xmath33 for both modulation and wiener amalgam spaces .",
    "in particular , we extend the results in @xcite to the case of a symmetric matrix @xmath31 .    0.2truecm in the second part of the paper we present some natural applications to partial differential equations _ with variable coefficients_. precisely , we study the cauchy problem for the schrdinger equation with a quadratic hamiltonian , namely @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the weyl quantization of a quadratic form on @xmath36 .",
    "the most interesting case is certainly the schrdinger equation with a quadratic potential .",
    "indeed , the solution @xmath37 to is given by @xmath38 where the operator @xmath39 is a metaplectic operator , so that the estimates resulting from the previous sections provide at once fixed - time estimates for the solution @xmath37 , in terms of the initial datum @xmath40 .",
    "an example is provided by the harmonic oscillator @xmath41 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , for which we deduce the dispersive estimate @xmath42 another hamiltonian we take into account is @xmath43 ( see @xcite ) . in this case",
    ", we show @xmath44 in section @xmath45 we shall combine these estimates with orthogonality arguments as in @xcite to obtain space - time estimates : the so - called strichartz estimates ( for the classical theory in lebesgue spaces , see @xcite ) .",

    ".    the case of the hamiltonian @xmath43 will be detailed in subsection @xmath57 .",
    "finally , we shall compare all these estimates with the classical ones in the lebesgue spaces ( subsection @xmath58 ) .",
    "our analysis combines techniques from time - frequency analysis ( e.g. , convolution relations , embeddings and duality properties of wiener amalgam and modulation spaces ) with methods from classical harmonic analysis and pde s theory ( interpolation results , hlder - type inequalities , fractional integration theory ) .",
    "this study carries on the one in @xcite , developed for the usual schrdinger equation ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "we record that hybrid spaces like the wiener amalgam ones had appeared before as a technical tool in pde s ( see , e.g. , tao @xcite ) .",
    "notice that fixed - time estimates between modulation spaces in the case @xmath59 were also considered in @xcite .",
    "finally we observe that , by combining the strichartz estimates in the present paper with arguments from functional analysis as in @xcite , wellposedness for schrdinger equations as above can also be proved , with an additional potential term in suitable wiener amalgam spaces ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
