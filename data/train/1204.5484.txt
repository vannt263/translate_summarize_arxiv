    "the sun s location in the disk of the milky way galaxy provides , in principle , an excellent vantage point to study the inner workings of a spiral galaxy .",
    "stellar populations can be resolved , chemical abundances and radial velocities can be obtained on a star - by - star basis , and the vertical , radial and azimuthal distribution of both stars and different phases of interstellar gas can be estimated .",
    "one of the principal complications , however , lies in the determination of distances of individual stars , star - forming regions and gas clouds .",
    "the possibility of substantial systematic errors in distance determination methods have made `` maps '' of the galactic stellar and interstellar distributions , particularly the maps of spiral structure , potentially unreliable .",
    "complicating this process is the fact that different components of the galaxy might reasonably be assumed to have different , albeit related , morphologies , as is observed in other spiral galaxies .",
    "@xcite , for example , distinguish between _ bright - star _ ( star - forming ) arms , _ dust _ arms , _ mass _ ( stellar density ) arms , and ( gravitational ) _ potential _ arms , each of which may have a different distribution .",
    "( to these four tracers , one might add _ neutral gas _",
    "arms , as concentrations of neutral hydrogen gas can have a distribution that is distinct from the tracers mentioned above . )    in this paper , we concentrate on the distance to ( infrared ) dark clouds , dense clouds of molecular gas and dust that are frequently associated with the early stages of star formation . until recently ,",
    "only kinematic distances were available for these objects , unless they could be clearly associated with young stellar clusters in which case photometric distances were also potentially available .",
    "the past decade has seen the development of new techniques to estimate the distances to dark clouds using the extinction of stellar sources along the line of sight ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are many different possible ways of estimating extinction distances , with different underlying assumptions and limitations , but in general these extinction distances hold the promise of producing three dimensional maps of dust distributions independent of kinematics .",
    "a key point to note is that kinematic , photometric , and extinction distances are not absolutely calibrated .",
    "although the systematic application of one method presumably yields useful information about relative distances , the lack of certainty about the accuracy of individual distances has led to some justifiable skepticism about maps derived from these techniques .",
    "for example , @xcite found good agreement between kinematic and extinction distances in the first quadrant , but a significant ( 1.5 kpc ) systematic difference between these two methods in the fourth quadrant .",
    "the on - going campaign to obtain radio trigonometric parallaxes to a set of masers across the galactic disk holds the promise to test , and perhaps even to calibrate , other methods for estimating distance .",
    "although the @xmath0 parallaxes expected will not be enough to completely map the galaxy , they _ may _ be enough to calibrate these other methods , or at the very least assess their reliability .",
    "@xcite , for example , have already developed a revised kinematic distance model based on early results .",
    "if the masers located in the coherent gas structures found in the longitude - velocity diagrams , ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , show systematic offsets between parallax and kinematic distances , it may be possible to reliably map the entire gaseous structure .",
    "this would be similar to how photometric distances  and more recently , parallax distances  of perseus arm star formation regions have been used to estimate the kinematic distance correction necessary to correctly map this structure ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is important to note , though , that the intrinsic velocity dispersion of clouds will always produce random errors in the kinematic distances that depend on longitude and radial velocity .",
    "moreover , the near - far kinematic distance ambiguity will remain , and even corrected kinematic distance will be unreliable for sources close to @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "extinction distances have a different set of selection biases and systematic errors from those associated with kinematic distances .",
    "in this work , we use maser parallaxes to test extinction distances .",
    "this is possible because masers are generally associated with star - forming regions .",
    "methanol masers , in particular , are associated with high - mass star formation in dark clouds . in this work ,",
    "we present a pilot study , examining the distance predictions for eleven clouds between @xmath3 for which we have near- and mid - infrared data , molecular line emission , and sub - millimeter observations . in  [ secparallax ] , we describe our sample of clouds and their parallax distance measurements .",
    "the kinematic distances to these clouds ( and their uncertainties ) are discussed in  [ seckinematic ] . in  [ secbluenumber ] and  [ secredgiant ] we present two extinction distance techniques which we compare to the maser parallax distances .",
    "the results of the comparison are outlined in  [ seccomparison ] .",
    "trigonometric parallax distances are largely free of astrophysical assumptions and therefore constitute an ideal source of information about the structure of our galaxy . recently",
    ", several groups have used very - long - baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) phase - referencing techniques to measure the parallax to masers in regions of massive star - formation with an accuracy of better than 10 @xmath4as . in the sample of maser parallax distance examined in this study the uncertainty on the distance is less than 25% out to 6 kpc .",
    "the groups involved include the bar and spiral structure legacy survey ( bessel ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) using the vlba ( very long baseline array ) , a survey using the european vlbi network ( evn ) @xcite , and the vlbi exploration of radio astronomy ( vera ) project ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these distances have been used to refine galactic parameters and rotation curves . in particular , @xcite used maser parallax distances to derive an updated rotation curve and found that the regions hosting massive star formation are systematically rotating 15 km s@xmath5 slower than the rest of the galaxy .",
    "this result assumes that the determination of the solar peculiar motion ( motion with respect to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) ) is well known from @xcite . in the wake of this paper ,",
    "several studies have attempted new estimates of the solar motion , without convergence to a single value ( see comparison tables in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , some results @xcite suggest that the solar peculiar motion in the v direction ( v@xmath6 ) was under - estimated by @xmath7 5 km s@xmath5 .",
    "this change would reduce the size of the lag in high - mass star - forming regions identified by @xcite to 10 km s@xmath5 , but not reduce it entirely .    for this study",
    ", we select a subset of the dark clouds with maser parallax distances . our methods for estimating extinction distances rely upon accurately establishing the boundaries of the densest portion of the cloud .",
    "because a wealth of data exists in the 1st quadrant of the galaxy , we limit ourselves to masers in this region .",
    "our ideal candidates are clouds with ukidss ( ukirt infrared deep sky survey ) galactic plane survey ( gps ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and galactic ring survey ( grs ; * ? ? ?",

    "kinematic distances , estimated by assuming gas is in circular rotation , are simple to calculate , but have several sources of systematic error . four difficulties with this method",
    "are ( 1 ) obtaining an accurate rotation curve , ( 2 ) correcting for solar motion , ( 3 ) breaking the `` near - far '' distance degeneracy in the inner galaxy ( where one velocity can map to two distances ) , and ( 4 ) allowing for non - circular motions in the vicinity of well - organized galactic structures .",
    "in addition , the uncertainties associated with kinematic distances depend strongly on longitude .    in order to capture some of the systematic uncertainties associated with choice of rotation curve and solar motion , we calculate kinematic distances to the maser clouds using two different galactic rotation curves .",
    "our first set of kinematic distances use the @xcite rotation curve , which includes a correction to v@xmath23 of the form ( @xmath24 ) km s@xmath5 ( which is in the same direction as the recent increase in v@xmath6 of 5 km s@xmath5 ) .",
    "our second set of kinematic distances uses the rotation curve proposed by @xcite , including the 15 km s@xmath5 lag for high - mass star - forming regions ( effectively a decrease of 15 km s@xmath5 in @xmath25 ) , since our study uses high - mass star - forming regions .",
    "the velocity used for these kinematic distances come from a variety of dense gas tracers in a variety of studies ; see table  [ clouds ] for the velocities we have used .",
    "we estimate the random error on kinematic distances due to non - circular motion by perturbing the reference velocity by @xmath26 3 km s@xmath5 and deriving the kinematic distance for the perturbed velocities . a velocity spread of 3 km s@xmath5 was chosen because this is the azimuthal ( i.e. 1d ) velocity dispersion of molecular clouds as reported in @xcite . because the far kinematic distance is much larger than the maser parallax distance for all these clouds",
    ", we always adopt the near kinematic distance .",
    "we note that in the absence of this prior information , hi self absorption can sometimes be used to break the distance ambiguity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "our first extinction distance method , the blue number count method , uses the number of foreground stars and a galactic model of the stellar distribution to estimate the distance to dark clouds . using star counts to estimate the distance to dark clouds goes back at least as far as @xcite and @xcite ( see * ? ? ? * for a history of the origins of this field ) .",
    "our version of this method exploits the relatively narrow range of intrinsic near - infrared colors of stars to separate foreground from background stars .",
    "clouds with sufficiently high column density will redden background stars to such an extent that the intrinsically reddest foreground star will be bluer than the intrinsically bluest background star .",
    "we can then simply count the number of stars bluer than this color threshold and compare with a galactic model of the stellar distribution to estimate a distance .",
    "this simple method has the advantage that the distribution of stellar colors in the galactic model need not be precisely correct , only the number density as a function of distance from the sun .",
    "this method is quite similar to the method applied to derive distances to nearby ( d @xmath27 1 kpc ) molecular clouds in @xcite and to more distant clouds in @xcite for distant infrared dark clouds ( irdcs ) .",
    "the blue number count method involves three steps : ( 1 ) define the region of the dark cloud associated with a maser source which is dense enough produce a clear color separation ; ( 2 ) count the number of blue stars within this region , accounting for confusion and incompleteness ; ( 3 ) compare the number of blue stars with a galactic model to determine a distance to the cloud . in the following sections we elaborate on each of these steps and",
    "illustrate the method in figure  [ sampleimage ] , [ samplehist ] , and [ sampledetermination ] for an example cloud , g23.01 - 0.41 .",
    "we also discuss some of the possible sources of bias and error in this method .",
    "the first step in the blue number count method is to identify the column density necessary to make a clear separation between foreground and background stars .",
    "the range of intrinsic @xmath28 colors is less than 1.5 magnitudes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore we need enough column density to produce at least 1.5 magnitudes of reddening in @xmath28 . using the @xcite extinction curve @xmath29 and @xmath30 , thus @xmath31 and the extinction required to produce the requisite amount of reddening to clearly separate foreground from background stars is 8.8 magnitudes of a@xmath32 .",
    "we use bolocam galactic plane survey ( bgps ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) data to identify the boundaries of the cloud with column densities large enough to produce an extinction of at least 8.8 magnitudes of a@xmath32 .",
    "we assume that @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the flux per beam , @xmath35 is the beam solid angle , @xmath36 is the mass per hydrogen molecule , @xmath37 is the dust opacity , and @xmath38 is the planck function . for bolocam data , @xmath39 m , and @xmath40 31 .",
    "we used @xmath41 , and @xmath42 @xmath43 g@xmath44 corresponding to the wavelength - interpolated @xcite value for dust grains with thin ice mantels in dense regions ( n = 10@xmath45 @xmath46 ) and assumed a dust temperature of t = 10 k. for these assumptions @xmath47 in the appropriate units ( since bgps data is available in maps with units of jy beam@xmath5 ) .",
    "n(h@xmath10 ) is then converted to @xmath48 assuming @xmath49 from @xcite .",

    "the various conversion factors assumed here ( @xmath50 , @xmath37 , and the relation between @xmath48 and n(@xmath51 ) ) are relatively uncertain , but the exact value we obtain is not critical to our analysis ; all we requires is that the adopted flux threshold produce a separation between foreground and background stars .",
    "figure  [ sampleimage ] displays this 0.12 mjy beam@xmath5 contour for our example cloud ( g23.01@xmath80.41 ) and shows how this contour matches the area over which stars are either very blue ( in front of the cloud ) or very red ( behind a large column of dust ) .",
    "three of our regions are not included in bgps because their galactic latitudes were too large to be included in the bgps . for two of these sources",
    "( iras 19213 + 1723 , g35.20 - 0.74 ) we use the grs @xmath52co data , integrated over @xmath26 15 km s@xmath5 and convert this to a column density using the conversion factors in @xcite . for g35.20 - 1.74 , no grs or bgps data is available , and we estimate the a@xmath32=8.8 mag region by hand , tracing the obvious dark extinction area .",
    "a few other cloud boundaries are adjusted to exclude regions of particularly bright emission or obvious foreground clusters of blue stars ( see figure  [ adjustcontours ] ) .",
    "the second step in the blue number count method is to count the number of blue stars within the region of interest while correctly accounting for completeness .",
    "the masers reside in regions of high extinction and active star formation .",
    "active star formation can produce significant nebulosity and thus a spatially variable background . on the other hand",
    ", the high extinction means that confusion is less severe when performing photometry on a dark cloud .",
    "average completeness estimates are therefore unreliable ; the completeness of a given survey is different for each cloud .    we performed our own estimates of the completeness by injecting synthetic stars at random positions within the a@xmath32=8.8 mag cloud contour and testing for their recovery using automatic photometry with source extractor @xcite",
    "for example , to estimate the completeness of a ukidss field we set the saturation level at 40,000 adu and used a 5-pixel ( 2 ) radius photometric aperture .",
    "this size aperture corresponds to the default aperture size apermag3 in the ukidss catalog .",
    "we ran 500 trials on each cloud , injecting stars as artificial circular gaussians into the @xmath53-band ukidss image .",
    "we estimate the median fwhm from all the stars in the image and use this value for the fwhm for our artificial stars .",
    "the noise comes from sitting on top of the noisy background of the image . in each trial we inserted stars with uniform integer magnitudes between 11 and 19 magnitudes , inclusive .",
    "we tested whether we retrieved input stars by searching for output stars within 1 pixel of the input position with a magnitude difference of no more than 0.5 magnitudes plus the magnitude uncertainty reported by source extractor .",
    "in addition we required a source extractor flag value of less than 4 , eliminating stars with saturated pixels or truncated objects but allowing the star to be partially blended with another star .",
    "we estimated the completeness of the field at integer magnitudes and interpolated between these values in order to weight each measured star appropriately , as shown in figure  [ completeness ] . because the completeness approaches zero beyond 17 magnitudes in @xmath53 , we limit the stars considered to be between @xmath53 of 11 and 17 magnitudes in order to avoid applying very large correction factor .",
    "we estimate completeness from the @xmath53-band image since the method only uses the blue stars ( @xmath28 @xmath27 1.5 mags ) , and the @xmath54 image is complete to significantly fainter magnitudes . a similar procedure was carried out for 2mass images",
    "; for 2mass we limited our analysis to 7 mag @xmath27 @xmath53 @xmath27 13 mag .",
    "our estimate of the completeness in the 2mass images is brighter than the quoted survey completeness for uncrowded regions of 2mass ( 14.3 magnitudes in @xmath53 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) because ( 1 ) even with dark clouds blocking out many background stars there are enough foreground stars in the galactic plane to cause some confusion , ( 2 ) there is significant near - infrared nebulosity in many regions , and ( 3 ) our parameters for identifying sources and performing photometry may be less sensitive and tolerant of source - blending than the procedures used to generate the 2mass catalog .",
    "we can not use the standard point - source catalogs from ukidss or 2mass because our completeness estimate is only appropriate for our particular photometric parameters .",
    "instead , we create our own catalog with the same source extractor parameters and quality checks as used in the completeness study and fit these measured magnitudes against ukidss and 2mass magnitudes to derive magnitude zero - points which puts our photometry roughly on the ukidss and 2mass photometric systems . because our results do not rely on exact colors , small color or magnitude offsets with respect to the standard catalog magnitudes are unimportant .",
    "figure  [ samplehist ] shows the @xmath28 stellar color histogram for our example cloud ( g23.01@xmath80.41 ) .",
    "the color separation between foreground and background stars is quite pronounced .",
    "the final step in the blue number count method is to compare our count of foreground stars with a galactic stellar distribution model .",
    "we use the besanon model @xcite to generate a synthetic stellar catalog consisting of distances and near - infrared magnitudes for each of our target fields .",
    "the besanon model allows the generation of a `` small - field '' catalog of arbitrary size .",
    "that is , we can obtain an arbitrarily large sample of stars at the desired position to reduce poisson noise in the simulated catalog .",
    "we assume that gradients in the stellar distribution across our fields are negligible .",
    "we include all spectral types and populations available in the model and initially include no diffuse extinction .",
    "the model output is a catalog of stars containing both intrinsic properties ( i.e. distance ) and observed quantities ( i.e. near - infrared magnitudes ) .",
    "we process the catalog produced from the besanon model to include diffuse galactic extinction .",
    "we use the default model value of 0.7 magnitudes of a@xmath32 per kpc .",
    "since typical maser distances are between 1 and 5 kpc , this gives us less than 3.5 magnitudes of visual extinction from the diffuse component which translates into a maximum @xmath55 of 0.57 magnitudes .",
    "our method does not work if there is a foreground cloud which produces significant excess extinction and our method should only be applied to clouds where auxiliary information confirms this exclusion .",
    "small changes to the diffuse extinction with distance will produce a small change in the distance estimate for nearby clouds and a moderate change for distant clouds .",
    "if the true diffuse extinction is larger than we assume , then some foreground stars could be reddened so much that we incorrectly identify them as background stars .",
    "the exclusion of these foreground stars would make clouds appear closer than they really are ; this is of particular concern for distant clouds where the impact of diffuse extinction is more significant .",
    "an alternative approach to dealing with diffuse extinction is adopted by @xcite , who use the 3d extinction profiles of @xcite to model the extinction as a function of distance along each line of sight .",
    "the @xcite profiles are derived using the same galactic model @xcite and near - infrared data ( 2mass ) , and it is therefore difficult to disentangle the uncertainty in these profiles from the other uncertainties in the model . by focusing only on the very dense portions of clouds we are able to reduce our sensitivity to the exact value of the diffuse extinction at the expense of using a smaller region of the cloud for our analysis .",
    "as long as there is a distinct break in the colors of stars we can separate foreground from background stars , and our only dependence on the galactic model is the number density of stars as a function of distance .",
    "we use the model catalog to define a monotonically increasing relationship between the cloud distance and surface number density of foreground ( blue : @xmath56 1.5 mags ) stars per square arcminute .",
    "this relationship saturates at some distance due to a combination of diffuse extinction and ( depending on galactic position ) the finite size of the galactic disk , but remains monotonic for all our clouds well past the estimated distance .",
    "we solve for the distance to a cloud by finding the distance at which our synthetic curve of blue foreground stars matches our estimated true number of blue stars , after correcting for completeness .",
    "we assume that the major source of random ( non - systematic ) uncertainty is poisson ( @xmath57 ) noise due to our small number of blue foreground stars and use the number of measured blue stars ( before correcting for completeness ) in this calculation .",
