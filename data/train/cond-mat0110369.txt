    "self - consistent theories which admit almost independent motion of quasiparticles and give rise to fermi gases constitute a basic tool to describe fermionic many - body systems .",
    "well known examples are independent - particle models in nuclear physics , quantum dots and wires in condensed matter physics and , within a mean - field theory for the valence electrons , the jellium model for the electronic properties of metals and of simple alkali metal clusters .",
    "one of the most spectacular predictions of mean - field theories is the occurrence of shell effects in the energy of the fermion gas as a function of the number of particles , that leads to magic numbers and deformations in nuclei and metallic particles @xcite .",
    "the shell and super  shell structures are quantum fluctuations that describe the bunching of the single - particle energy levels with respect to their average behavior . from a semiclassical point of view @xcite ,",
    "the bunching of the energy levels is interpreted as a modulation produced by the classical periodic orbits .",
    "similar quantum fluctuations are present in all the equilibrium thermodynamic functions describing the many - body system",
    ". as we will see in detail in the following , there are two main features of the single  particle spectrum that influence the thermodynamic quantum fluctuations of a fermi gas . on the one hand , the spectral fluctuations on local scales ,",
    "i.e. in the range of the mean level spacing @xmath0 between single  particle energy levels .",
    "these local fluctuations are universal , and the universality class depends on the nature of the single - particle dynamics @xcite .",
    "there are two main classes , corresponding to regular and irregular ( fully chaotic ) motion , respectively ( with subclasses in the latter case depending on the presence or not of time reversal symmetry ) .",
    "the local statistics of regular systems are described by a set of uncorrelated levels , while the chaotic ones by random matrix ensembles .",
    "the second ingredient that strongly influences the thermodynamic fluctuations are the shell effects , i.e. the long range modulations of the spectrum produced by the short periodic orbits .",
    "these occur on a scale @xmath1 related to the inverse time of flight across the system , with typically @xmath2 .",
    "contrary to the local fluctuations , the long  range modulations are system - dependent , since the short orbits are .",
    "the amplitude of this effect depends on the nature of the dynamics .",
    "if the classical motion is regular , symmetries are present , periodic orbits come in degenerate families , and shell effects are important . on the contrary , if the corresponding classical motion is chaotic , the periodic orbits are isolated and the long - range modulations will have , compared to the regular case , a smaller amplitude .",
    "different aspects of both quantum phenomena , namely the universality of the single  particle fluctuations on a scale @xmath0 and the appearance of long  range shell effects on scales @xmath1 , and their influence in the thermodynamics of fermi gases , have been considered in nuclear and atomic physics , and in different condensed  matter systems ( see for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in most cases",
    "the interest concentrated on particular systems , or in the study of mean properties .",
    "our main goal is , within a fermi gas approximation , to provide a statistical analysis of the quantum fluctuations of the different thermodynamic functions , like for example of the total energy of the gas , the entropy , etc , and to explicitly compute their probability distribution function .",
    "special attention is devoted to the temperature dependence and to the typical magnitude of the fluctuations .",
    "other aspects , like the autocorrelation functions and the connexion between the fluctuations of the gas and those of the single  particle levels at fermi energy , are also investigated .",
    "we concentrate in the fluctuations of equilibrium properties of _ ballistic _ fermi systems ( i.e. with no disorder present in the potential ) whose mean - field single particle motion is either regular or fully chaotic .",
    "schematically we have in mind a mean - field potential which is almost flat in the interior and rises at the surface , like the woods - saxon potential in nuclear physics , or the static homogeneous potential produced by the ionic background in the jellium model . under these conditions , and in particular in the extreme case of a sharp boundary , the nature of the classical dynamics is determined by the shape of the cavity and by the external fields acting on the system .",
    "we will ignore physical effects related to the spin degree of freedom , and we will moreover assume that the inelastic processes can be ignored , namely the coherence length of the fermions is much larger than the system size .",
    "the picture that emerges from our analysis is very rich .",
    "the quantum thermodynamic fluctuations can be either dominated by the local universal or by the long  range system  specific fluctuations of the single particle spectrum . among these two possibilities ,",
    "the prevailing aspect depends on the quantity considered , on the nature of the underlying classical dynamics , and on temperature . when the fluctuations are dominated by the local fluctuations , the corresponding thermodynamic probability distributions are universal .",
    "when conveniently normalized , they only depend on the temperature and the quantity considered , but not on any specific property of the system ( aside the regular or chaotic nature of the single  particle motion ) .",
    "the universality of the thermodynamic fluctuations follows the classification of the local fluctuations given above : one universality class for systems whose classical single  particle dynamics is regular , another for those with a chaotic dynamics ( with subclasses depending on the presence or not of time reversal symmetry ) .",
    "universal fluctuations are observed , for some thermodynamic functions , at temperatures much smaller than @xmath1 .",
    "examples are the fluctuations of the number of particles for systems with fixed chemical potential when the underlying classical dynamics is chaotic , and those of the entropy and the specific heat for regular and chaotic motion .",
    "the corresponding probability distributions are found to be , in general , non - gaussian .",
    "for temperatures of order @xmath0 their shape is very sensitive to temperature variations , but they always remain in the corresponding universality class . when temperatures of order @xmath1 are reached , the universality is lost . at those temperatures",
    "the short orbits become dominant , producing system  dependent effects .",
    "the moments of the distributions can then be computed from periodic orbit theory , as described below . at still higher temperatures",
    "the fluctuations are exponentially suppressed .",
    "in contrast to the first type described above , sometimes the thermodynamic fluctuations are dominated by the long range modulations of the single  particle spectrum produced by the short periodic orbits . due to the system specific nature of the short orbits , the corresponding probability distributions are non - universal , non - gaussian functions .",
    "we have obtained explicit convergent expressions to compute all the moments for this type of fluctuations in terms of periodic orbits .",
    "interference effects between repetitions of the orbits produce , in particular , non  vanishing odd moments and lead to asymmetric distributions .",
    "the fluctuations of all the thermodynamic functions are of this type for temperatures of order @xmath1 or higher .",
    "however , some thermodynamic functions have non - universal fluctuations _ at any temperature_. examples of the latter behavior are the fluctuations of the total energy of the gas , the response of the system when an external parameter is varied and , only in the case of a regular single  particle dynamics , the fluctuations of the number of particles for systems with fixed chemical potential . due to the dominance of the long range modulations , the probability distributions are relatively insensitive to temperature variations up to temperatures of order @xmath1 . at temperatures higher than @xmath1 the typical size of the fluctuations decay exponentially . finally , the autocorrelation functions in this case present long range order .    as a general rule , but with exceptions depending on the quantity and on the temperature considered , clear signatures of the regular or chaotic nature of the dynamics are found in the fluctuations . for example , their typical size is in general much larger in integrable systems compared to chaotic ones .",
    "the relative amplifying factor is found to be some growing function of the adimensional parameter @xmath3 .",
    "besides , and irrespective of the nature of the dynamics , the fluctuations of the gas are always much larger than the corresponding fluctuations of the single  particle energy levels at fermi energy",
    ". their relation is also expressed in terms of @xmath4 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ 2 ] contains the basic definitions concerning the thermodynamics of a fermi gas .",
    "an arbitrary thermodynamic function is decomposed into a smooth plus an oscillatory part .",
    "the smooth part describes the usual thermodynamics of the gas ( bulk properties ) , while the oscillatory part are the quantum finite - size fluctuations .",
    "the latter are expressed in terms of the periodic orbits of the classical motion associated with the corresponding single - particle dynamics .",
    "the validity of this approximation and the main energy scales involved in the problem are also introduced . in section",
    "[ 3 ] the variance of the thermodynamic functions is written in terms of the spectral form factor , i.e. the fourier transform of the single  particle spectral two - point correlation function ( eq.([grandk ] ) ) .",
    "this connexion allows to make a qualitative analysis of the behavior of the moments of the probability distribution of the different functions and for the different kinds of classical motions .",
    "the second moment is explicitly computed in section [ 4 ] using a schematic approximation for the short - time dynamics that provides simple but qualitatively useful expressions . the dependence on particle number and on temperature is explicitly considered .",
    "the complete characterization of the probability distribution of the fluctuations is included in section [ 5 ] .",
    "the moments are explicitly computed for quantities whose distribution is dominated , by the short orbits . on the contrary ,",
    "local uncorrelated levels and random matrix fluctuations are used to compute the distribution of universal functions ( at low temperatures ) .",
    "similar arguments are exploited in section [ 6 ] to compute the autocorrelation of the thermodynamic functions as a function of the different parameters .",
    "the application of our general results to different systems , like the atomic nuclei , mesoscopic quantum dots and metallic clusters is briefly discussed in section [ 7 ] .",
    "this section contains also a discussion on the relation between the fluctuations of the gas and those of the individual single  particle energy levels .",
    "our final remarks are included in section [ 8 ] . all over the paper",
    "we compare some of the results with numerical simulations of fermi gases contained in regular and chaotic cavities .",

    "for example , in the grand canonical formalism the expectation value of the number of particles in the system is @xmath18 another important thermodynamic quantity is the reaction of the system to a variation of the external parameter @xmath9 , characterized by the response function ( here in the grand canonical formalism ) @xmath19 the physical interpretation of @xmath20 depends on the sample geometry and on the nature of the parameter @xmath9 .",

    "finally , we will also consider the entropy @xmath22 from which , in particular , the many",
    " body level density may be computed by exponentiation , and the specific heat ( in the canonical ensemble ) @xmath23 the case of the susceptibility , i.e. the variation of the response function ( the second derivative of the grand potential ) @xmath24 is a more subtle problem and will not be considered here in detail .    assuming the single - particle spectrum eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) known for any @xmath9 , the integration in eq.([grand ] ) is straightforward .",
    "it leads , by differentiation , to sums over the single - particle energy levels whose structure depends on the quantity considered .",
    "as the temperature is lowered the fermi factor @xmath25 involved in the sums tends to the heaviside step function , which restricts the sums to the single  particle energy levels satisfying the condition @xmath26 . in this limit the grand potential",
    "is closely related to the ground state energy of the fermi gas ( it is the sum of the single particle energy levels measured with respect to the fermi energy ) , @xmath27 is the number of occupied single  particle levels , and the response of the system is the sum up to the fermi energy of the single - particle contributions @xmath28 .",
    "they all involve the ensemble of particles of the fermi gas .",
    "in contrast , other quantities , like the entropy and the specific heat , vanish at zero temperature .",
    "we now express the thermodynamic functions in terms of classical quantities related to the single  particle dynamics ( cf ref.@xcite for a good introduction ) . the density of states in eq.([grand ] )",
    "is written as a sum of smooth plus oscillatory terms @xmath29 this approximation is valid in the semiclassical regime @xmath30 where the typical wavelength of the fermions at energy @xmath5 is much smaller than the system size , and fails at the bottom of the spectrum .",
    "the first , smooth term @xmath31 corresponds to the bulk contribution .",

    ", according to table  v , may take quite large values in real systems , plays an important role in setting the scale of the fluctuations of thermodynamic functions .",
    "as summarized in table  ii , it determines the relative value of the fluctuations in integrable systems as compared to chaotic ones for quantities like the energy or the response of the gas .",

    "the global picture emerging from these relations is quite instructive .",
    "contrary to naive expectations , eq.([sp2 ] ) shows that the typical fluctuations of a single  particle level located at @xmath33 are not of order @xmath0 , but are `` amplified '' by the fluctuations of the particle number .",
    "since the latter are larger in integrable systems compared to chaotic ones ( by a relative factor @xmath121 ) , then @xmath122 .",

    "one should however keep in mind that @xmath125 is bigger in integrable systems with respect to chaotic ones by a factor of order @xmath4 , and therefore the overall fluctuations of the response of the gas are more important if the dynamics is integrable . when computed in the particular case of the persistent currents in mesoscopic rings , @xmath126 , where the external parameter @xmath9 is now the magnetic flux threading the ring , the formula @xmath127 in table  ii valid for chaotic systems gives for the typical current @xmath128 ( where @xmath129 is the speed of light and @xmath130 the flux quantum ) , in agreement with the result obtained in @xcite using a greens  function approach , and with the @xmath124 amplification obtained for integrable systems ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "remember that @xmath131 is the number of fermions contained in the last shell , i.e. in a window of size @xmath1 below the fermi energy .",
    "this number of particles has to be compared with the total number of fermions @xmath132 ( in @xmath46 dimensions ) .",
    "( [ sp3 ] ) and ( [ rsp4 ] ) show that neither the total number of particles , nor an individual single  particle level ( located at @xmath33 ) , are responsible for the fluctuations of the gas , but rather the intermediate number @xmath4 , with typically @xmath133 .",
    "the quantum fluctuations of the gas therefore originate from the contributions of the @xmath4 particles located in the last shell , as already pointed out in ref .",
    "however , the way these particles contribute to the fluctuations depend on the quantity considered .",
    "( [ sp3 ] ) shows that they contribute `` coherently '' in the case of the total ground  state energy , since @xmath134 is proportional to @xmath4 ( ignoring the @xmath135 denominator in the chaotic case ) .",

    "the situation is more subtle for quantities like the entropy .",
    "as was shown in section [ 4b ] , the temperature dependence of the variance for @xmath136 is unique , independent of the nature of the single  particle dynamics ( and given by eq .",
    "( [ s4 ] ) ) . however , at higher temperatures differences are observed .",
    "the maximum of the typical value of the entropy fluctuations , @xmath137 , is of order @xmath11 for chaotic systems , and it is reached at @xmath138 , whereas for integrable systems",

    "there are several distinct applications of the present results . among them",

    "the distribution of the energy of a fermi gas whose single  particle energy levels are given by the imaginary part of the complex zeros of the riemann zeta function was recently investigated @xcite .",
    "this fictitious fermionic system was named `` the riemannium '' .",
    "aside its mathematical interest , it serves as an explicit and important test of our results relating the probability distribution of thermodynamic functions to periodic orbit theory .",
    "this is because there exist strong connexions between the quantum theory of chaotic systems and the complex zeros of the riemann zeta function interpreted as spectral eigenvalues .",
    "a high precision agreement was found between the numerical results and the moments of the probability distribution of @xmath142 computed from the results of section [ 5a ] for the riemannium .",
    "our results illustrate the strong connexions and deep relationships that exist between , on the one hand , the thermodynamic quantum fluctuations of confined fermi gases and , on the other , the statistical theories of level fluctuations and periodic orbit theory .    the regular or chaotic nature of the single  particle motion imprints the single  particle spectrum in two different ways .",
    "the first one occurs at the scale of the mean level spacing @xmath0 , and produces different ( but universal ) statistical fluctuations .",
    "the second acts on a much larger scale @xmath1 , set by the inverse of the time of flight across the system .",
    "a bunching of the single  particle levels produced by the short periodic orbits is observed on this scale , whose intensity depends on the regular or chaotic nature of the motion .",
    "the main theme of our investigations has been to determine how these two features of the single  particle spectrum influence the probability distribution of the quantum fluctuations of the different thermodynamic functions of the gas , and to establish their temperature dependence .",
    "we find a rich variety of phenomena and of different regimes . in some cases",
    "the thermodynamic quantum fluctuations directly reflect the universality of the single  particle spectrum on the scale @xmath0 .",
    "their corresponding probability distributions are universal functions , whose shape depends on the quantity and temperature considered , and on the regular or chaotic nature of the dynamics , but not on the precise shape or other specific properties of the system . in other cases ,",
    "the fluctuations are , in contrast , totally determined by the long  range modulations of the single  particle spectrum on scales @xmath1 .",
    "they are therefore insensitive to the universality present on the scale @xmath0 . for some thermodynamic quantities ,",
    "this type of fluctuations are dominant even at zero temperature .",

    "even those dominated at low temperatures by the universal features of the single  particle spectrum , fall in this second class . in all cases and for the different regimes ,",
    "we have shown how the probability distributions can be explicitly computed in each case .",
    "the variance of the thermodynamic functions has also been investigated using a simple approximation , that takes only into account the regular or chaotic nature of the single  particle dynamics and the time of flight across the system .",
    "it has the advantage of providing a good qualitative description for the different thermodynamic quantities as a function of temperature , number of particles , etc , while requiring a minimum amount of information about the system .",
    "although more accurate descriptions can be made if more information is available , this approximation is clearly of interest in experiments where the parameters controlling the system , like its shape , are not well known .",
    "a closely related problem is the motion of quasiparticles in potentials with bulk disorder .",
    "this case has been extensively treated in condensed matter physics in particular as a model for the electronic properties of metals and semiconductors .",
    "compared to the ballistic motion considered here , the disorder introduces a new scale , the elastic mean free path @xmath143 between impurities .",
    "when @xmath143 is much smaller than the system size @xmath144 ( and @xmath144 is much smaller than the localization length ) , the single  particle motion across the system is diffusive .",
    "the corresponding energy scale is the thouless energy , @xmath145 , with @xmath146 the diffusion coefficient .",
    "similarly to the influence of the ( short ) periodic orbits in the ballistic case , the diffusive motion produces long  range correlations in the single  particle spectrum @xcite .",
    "however , the nature of the correlations are different in both cases . therefore , the statistics of the quantum thermodynamic fluctuations that are dominated by the long range correlations are going to be different .",
    "an analogous study for diffusive systems to the one made here in the ballistic case is therefore necessary . in contrast",
    ", it has been shown that the local fluctuations of the single  particle levels on a scale @xmath0 are , in the metallic regime of disordered systems , also described by random matrix theory @xcite . therefore",
    ", our results concerning the quantum fluctuations of thermodynamic quantities in the universal regime apply also to disordered systems .",
    "the quantum fluctuations considered may be compared to other fluctuations , the thermal ones .",
    "although the latter are inherent to any thermodynamical treatment , their physical origin and their experimental manifestation is very different from that of the quantum fluctuations here considered .",
    "many experiments have verified the validity and accuracy of the physical picture obtained from mean  field , single ",
    "particle approximations to many  body systems .",
    "however the nature of the modifications induced by the ( residual ) interactions in the probability distribution of the thermodynamic fluctuations remains an open problem .",
