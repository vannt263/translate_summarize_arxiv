    "<S> [ fig:5](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> this figure indicates the presence of a fermi - level pseudogap ( pg ) in a wide temperature range , as in photoemission and infrared experiments  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a zero temperature pseudogap is to be expected : hartree - fock studies of the multiorbital hubbard model  @xcite already detected such a feature . </S>",
    "<S> however , our finite temperature studies reveal that upon cooling this pseudogap develops at a @xmath102 clearly above @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the pseudogap is present when short - range spin correlations are present [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:5](b ) ] : the `` nematic fluctuations '' regime is basically the @xmath7-range where @xmath11/@xmath12 magnetic fluctuations exist . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling to the lattice creates concomitant local orthorrombic distortions : the region between @xmath0 and @xmath102 is tetragonal only on average  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all these results are in good agreement with recent scanning tunneling spectroscopy studies of nafeas  @xcite .    _ conclusions . _ our combined numerical and analytical study of the spin fermion model leads to results in agreement with the experimentally measured nematic susceptibility of ba(fe@xmath8co@xmath9)@xmath10as@xmath10  @xcite . in our analysis , which was time consuming and required a new mc setup , magnetism is the main driver , but the lattice / orbital are crucial to boost critical temperatures . for spins coupled to the lattice our spin - nematic susceptibility has a curie - weiss behavior for @xmath2 governed by a @xmath3 which we here identify as the critical @xmath1 of the purely electronic sector , which is preexisting to the introduction of the lattice . for realistic nonzero electron - lattice couplings , </S>",
    "<S> the lattice induces a nematic / structural transition at a higher temperature @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the addition of an orbital - lattice coupling @xmath59 further increases @xmath0 , although the curie - weiss behavior continues being regulated by @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> our main prediction is that whenever fluctuating nematic order is observed , inelastic neutron scattering for the same sample should also reveal the existence of short - range magnetic order : nematic fluctuations , pseudogap , and short - range antiferromagnetic order should all develop _ simultaneously _ in these materials .    </S>",
