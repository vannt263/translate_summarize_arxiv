    "quantum computation is widely regarded as being more powerful than classical computation . indeed in some scenarios there",
    "are provable benefits , such as an exponential reduction in communication resources for some distributed computing tasks ( e.g. raz 1999 ) and in quantum cryptography , the ability to communicate with unconditional security against eavesdropping .",
    "these results depend neither on any computational hardness assumptions nor on the presence of any oracle relativisations . furthermore in suitably relativised oracle models of computation",
    "there are various known exponential savings in quantum versus classical query complexity such as deutsch and jozsa 1992 and simon 1997 .",
    "however for pure ( unrelativised ) computation there is to date no proof of separation and it is still possible that efficient classical and quantum computational power might coincide i.e. the complexity classes bpp and bqp might be equal .",
    "( see for example nielsen and chuang 2000 for a definition of these classes . here and below the term `` efficient '' is synonymous with `` polynomial time '' ) .",
    "note that this is not the same question as the issue of efficient classical simulation of quantum processes since any bqp algorithm is a quantum process of only a severely restricted kind , required to satisfy infinitely many constraints relative to an infinite set of input states viz .",
    "all computational basis states . in this paper",
    "we will study a representation of quantum computation in which the gap ( if it exists ) between efficient classical and efficient quantum computation appears to be surprisingly fragile , being provably bridged by a very modest use of a seemingly trivial resource ( cf theorems [ one ] and [ two ] below ) .",
    "we will provide a self contained development of a class of quantum circuits based on so - called matchgates , a notion that was introduced in valiant 2002 .",
    "our approach is closely related to work of knill 2001 , terhal and divincenzo 2002 and divincenzo and terhal 2005 , relating matchgate circuits to free fermionic quantum computation ( and later further extended in bravyi 2005 , 2008 ) . here",
    "we will emphasise the underlying mathematical ingredients and consider some further properties and generalisations that go beyond the fermionic formalism . indeed",
    "the existence of a physical interpretation in terms of fermionic physics , although interesting , appears to be entirely fortuitous and of no particular consequence for our considerations of computational complexity issues _ per se_.    consider 2-qubit gates @xmath0 of the form ( in the computational basis ) : @xmath4 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are both in @xmath1 or both in @xmath5 with the _",
    "same determinant_. thus the action of @xmath0 amounts to @xmath2 acting in the even parity subspace ( spanned by @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) and @xmath3 acting in the odd parity subspace ( spanned by @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) .",
    "occasionally we will wish to consider 2-qubit gates of the form eq .",
    "( [ gab ] ) but having det @xmath10 det @xmath3 . in this case",
    "the gate will be denoted @xmath11 . to emphasise this distinction",
    "we sometimes refer to a gate with det @xmath12 det @xmath3 as an _ allowable _ @xmath0 gate .",
    "we will denote the pauli operators by @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "[ one ] consider any uniform ( hence poly - sized ) quantum circuit family comprising only @xmath0 gates such that : + ( i ) the @xmath0 gates act on nearest neighbour ( n.n . ) lines only ; + ( ii ) the input state is any product state ; + ( iii ) the output is a final measurement in the computational basis on any single line .",
    "+ then the output may be classically efficiently simulated .",
    "more precisely for any @xmath16 we can classically efficiently compute the expectation value @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the pauli @xmath15 operator on the @xmath19 line , @xmath20 is the final state and @xmath21 are the outcome probabilities .",
    "theorem [ one ] is very similar to the classical simulation result of valiant 2002 and terhal and divincenzo 2002 .",
    "our result is more general in the feature of allowing arbitrary product state inputs ( rather than just computational basis states ) .",
    "it is more restrictive in considering only single bit outputs ( rather than individual probabilities of computational basis measurements across many lines ) and in not encompassing the adaptive circuits that are included in terhal and divincenzo 2002 .",
    "the notion of _ efficient classical simulation _ that we will use in this paper is the following .",
    "let @xmath22 be any uniform family of quantum circuits together with ( i ) a specified class of input states ( usually taken to be product states , but we may also restrict to just computational basis states ) and ( ii ) a specified class of output measurements ( which we take to be @xmath18 , a @xmath15-basis measurement on any single line ) .",
    "we say that @xmath22 is _ classically efficiently simulatable _",
    "( relative to ( i ) and ( ii ) ) if the probabilities of measurement outcomes can be _ computed _ by classical means to @xmath23 digits of accuracy in poly@xmath24 time .",
    "note that this ability to efficiently _ compute _ the probabilities to _ exponential _ accuracy is a rather strong notion e.g. we might instead adopt weaker criteria such as the ability to compute the probabilities to accuracy @xmath25 i.e. @xmath26 digits in poly@xmath24 time , or the ability to _ sample _ the output probability distribution _ once _",
    "( by classical efficient probabilistic means , to suitably accuracy ) . indeed the last requirement would suffice in issues of the comparison of quantum to classical computational power but we will in fact achieve the strongest notion above in our results and we thus adopt it as our definition .",
    "we make further comments about implications of this strong notion of classical simulation in the concluding section [ concls ] below .",
    "note that if the n.n .",
    "@xmath0 circuits in theorem [ one ] are considered with computational basis inputs and also required to satisfy the bqp bounded probability conditions ( viz . that the output probabilities are always @xmath27 or @xmath28 ) , then the ability to classically _ calculate _ the output probabilities ( rather than the ability merely to sample the output distribution once ) implies that the corresponding decision problem is not just in bpp but actually in p i.e. _ deterministic _ classical polynomial time .    in the following sections we will first prove a universality result for @xmath0 gates , if these gates are also allowed to act on next - n.n . lines in addition to the n.n",
    ". lines of theorem [ one ] .",
    "then we give some background on the origin of the notion of matchgates , which first lead to the consideration of circuits of @xmath0 gates in valiant 2002 .",
    "next we consider a formalism of anti - commuting variables that form a clifford algebra , leading to a proof of theorem [ one ] .",
    "this approach is essentially the one given in knill 2001 and terhal and divincenzo 2002 , but we give some more transparent proofs and we develop further properties .",
    "first , we elucidate the n.n .",
    "condition ( i ) in theorem [ one ] : we show that the general class of simulatable gates comprises a uniformly describable family that may act on any number of the @xmath29 qubits , in which the @xmath0 gates appear as the subset of n.n .",
    "2-qubit gates . we show furthermore that all gates in the family can be obtained as _ circuits _ of n.n .",
    "@xmath0 gates ( hence adding nothing new ) and that non - n.n . @xmath0 gates are not generally in the family .",
    "second , by considering clifford _ operations _ ( i.e. @xmath29-qubit unitary operations that normalise the @xmath29-qubit pauli group in @xmath30 ) in conjunction with the clifford algebra formalism , we will describe an avenue for generalising theorem [ one ] and give some examples of simulatable circuits which can not be obtained as circuits of n.n .",
    "@xmath0 gates only . since all our classes of classically simulatable circuits comprise gates that are generated by hamiltonians expressible as quadratic elements of a clifford algebra , we call them _ gaussian quantum circuits_.",
    "the n.n . condition in theorem [ one](i ) is perhaps a surprising ingredient but it is crucial : it was already mentioned in terhal and divincenzo 2002 ( based on a result in kempe _",
    "2001 ) that n.n .",
    "@xmath0 gates together with the swap gate @xmath31 , or equivalently @xmath0 gates acting on arbitrary pairs of qubit lines , can perform universal quantum computation .",
    "we will prove a stronger result :    [ two ] let @xmath22 be any uniform family of quantum circuits with output given by a @xmath15 basis measurement on the first line .",
    "then @xmath22 may be simulated by a circuit of @xmath0 gates acting on n.n . or next n.n .",
    "lines only ( i.e. on line pairs at most distance 2 apart ) with at most a constant increase in the size of the circuit .    before the proof",
    "we make a few remarks . as an immediate corollary",
    "we have that any bqp algorithm can be simulated by a poly - sized circuit of @xmath0 gates acting only on n.n .",
    "and next - n.n . lines .",
    "this fact together with theorem [ one ] shows that a very limited use of the seemingly innocuous operation @xmath31 ( on n.n .",
    "lines ) allowing n.n . @xmath0",
    "gates to act on lines just one further apart , suffices to bridge the gap between classical and quantum efficient computational power .",
    "the result becomes perhaps even more striking if we note that @xmath31 itself is very close to being expressible in the allowed @xmath0 form .",
    "indeed @xmath32 and fails only through a mere minus sign in @xmath33 . thus if we drop the @xmath34 condition in eq .",
    "( [ gab ] ) , then the resulting @xmath11 gates acting on n.n .",
    "lines become efficiently universal for quantum computation .",
    "the significance of @xmath31 ( or equivalently the ability of 2-qubit gates to act on distant lines ) for quantum computational power appears also in a different context . using the formalism of tensor network contractions",
    "it may be shown ( markov and shi 2008 , jozsa 2006 and yoran and short 2006 ) that any poly - sized quantum circuit of 1- and 2- qubit gates , which has log depth and in which the 2-qubit gates are restricted to act at bounded range ( i.e. on line pairs at most distance @xmath35 apart , for some constant @xmath35 ) may be classically efficiently simulated .",
    "it is also known ( cleve and watrous 2000 ) that shor s quantum factoring algorithm ( shor 1997 ) can be implemented as a log depth circuit but its 2-qubit gates act on distant lines , @xmath36 apart , which is not bounded with increasing input size @xmath29 .",
    "thus from this point of view , the quantum advantage of the algorithm ( over classical algorithms ) rests entirely on the presence of _ unboundedly _ distant actions ( or unbounded use of @xmath31 ) .",
    "also it is shown in terhal and divincenzo 2004 and jozsa 2006 that all depth 2 circuits ( followed by a measurement ) are classically efficiently simulatable even if 2-qubit gates act on arbitrary line pairs while the same simulation result for depth 3 circuits ( with a suitably strong notion of classical simulation ) would imply equality of bpp and bqp . here again the feature of unboundedly distant action is essential , whereas our result in theorems [ one ] and [ two ] achieves full efficient quantum computational power by passage from distance one to just bounded distance two .     gates .",
    "the logical single - qubit unitary gate @xmath2 and the logical two - qubit @xmath37 gate are illustrated in ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    * proof of theorem [ two ] * : given any uniform quantum circuit family we may assume w.l.o.g .",
    "that it comprises n.n .",
    "controlled-@xmath15 gates ( n.n .",
    "@xmath37 ) and 1-qubit gates generically denoted as @xmath2 .",
    "we start with a _ quadrupled _ number of qubit lines and encode the original input @xmath38 s and @xmath39 s as logical basis states @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively in consecutive blocks of 4 lines each ( cf the remark after the proof ) . then with suitably encoded gate operations the whole computation will stay within tensor products of span@xmath42 of each quadruple of qubits .    on any such quadruple of lines ,",
    "say 1234 , we can perform the encoded 1-qubit gate @xmath2 as the following sequence of allowed n.n .",
    "gates ( depicted in figure [ fig : universal_valiant ] ( a ) ) : @xmath43 ( where the subscripts denote the line numbers ) . to see this , note that @xmath44 so that @xmath45 can be thought of ( for our logical basis states ) as just swapping lines 1 and 4 into positions 2 and 3 . in view of the form of the encoding @xmath46 and @xmath47 , the logical qubit",
    "is then encoded in the @xmath48 subspace of lines 2 and 3 so @xmath49 will apply the 1-qubit gate @xmath2 to it . finally the lines are swapped back to their original positions , restoring the encoding .    to perform",
    "an encoded @xmath37 on two consecutive quadruples , say 1234 and 5678 we simply apply @xmath50 i.e. @xmath37 on the `` crossover '' pair of lines 4 and 5 .",
    "indeed for any pair of basis states @xmath51 and @xmath52 we ll get a minus sign iff @xmath53 , giving the correct action on any encoded @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "next note that since composition of @xmath0 gates amounts to multiplying the @xmath2 s and @xmath3 s separately we obtain ( with all gates acting on lines 4 and 5 ) @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the hadamard operator . in the last expression , @xmath58 is @xmath31 and all other gates are allowable @xmath0 gates .",
    "this implementation of @xmath50 is depicted in figure [ fig : universal_valiant ] ( b ) .",
    "finally note that in an arbitrary such circuit , @xmath31 is used only on `` crossover '' pairs ( 4,5 ) , ( 8,9 ) etc . of the encoding quadruples ( 1,2,3,4 ) , ( 5,6,7,8 ) , ( 9,10,11,12 )",
    "hence no line is ever moved more than one position distant from its original location , by overall action of any number of such @xmath31s .",
    "we may commute all these @xmath31 operations out to the output end of the circuit . in so doing , any line of each ( originally n.n . ) @xmath0 gate in eq .",
    "( [ gaa ] ) may be moved by at most one place but we can never move both lines of any n.n .",
    "@xmath0 gate in view of the block size 4 of the encoding .",
    "thus the resulting circuit ( with @xmath31 s eliminated ) comprises only @xmath0 gates acting on n.n . or next - n.n .",
    "lines , as required .    in this process",
    "@xmath31 gates need to be commuted across @xmath59 and @xmath60 gates ( cf eq .",
    "( [ cz45 ] ) ) .",
    "but for any @xmath0 we have ( using @xmath61 ) that @xmath62 and the last gate is an allowed @xmath0 gate . since the whole computation is engineered to represent the original given circuit , recoded in the @xmath63 subspaces of consecutive line quadruples , a final measurement on line 1 will produce the same output distribution as a measurement on qubit 1 in the original given circuit .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem [ two ] .",
    "@xmath64    we remark that instead of the quadruple encoding above , we might have considered the simpler @xmath65 and @xmath66 as a potentially more natural choice . indeed in that case the 1-qubit gate @xmath2 is applied very simply as @xmath49 ( in contrast to eq .",
    "( [ gaa ] ) ) but the @xmath31 s from the @xmath37 actions may now move both lines of a n.n .",
    "@xmath0 gate in opposite directions , resulting in @xmath0 s on lines up to distance 3 ( rather than just 2 ) apart .",
    "before beginning our development of theorem [ one ] we give some brief background remarks on the interesting provenance of valiant s notion of matchgates .",
    "( these remarks will not be used in any further results ) .",
    "matchgates arose ( valiant 2002 , 2007 ) in the context of the theory of perfect matchings in graphs . for a graph @xmath67 a perfect matching",
    "is a set @xmath68 of edges such that each vertex is the endpoint of exactly one edge in @xmath68 .",
    "it is known that the problem of counting the number of perfect matchings in a graph is computationally very hard ( being complete for the complexity class # p , c.f .",
    "papadimitriou 1994 ) but for _ planar _ graphs it is , remarkably , computable in polynomial time , using the fisher - kasteleyn - temperley ( fkt ) algorithm ( kasteleyn 1961 , temperley and fisher 1961 and jerrum 2003 ) .",
    "more generally we may consider weighted graphs @xmath67 in which each edge @xmath69 is assigned a weight @xmath70 and introduce the so - called match sum : @xmath71 then the fkt algorithm provides a polynomial time computation of the match sum for any planar graph .",
    "next consider a ( planar ) weighted graph with a designated set @xmath72 of `` input '' vertices and a disjoint designated set @xmath73 of `` output '' vertices , and consider the indexed collection ( tensor ) @xmath74 where each index takes values 0 and 1 and @xmath75 is the graph obtained from @xmath67 by deleting all those input and output vertices ( together with their incident edges ) that have corresponding index @xmath76 or @xmath77 set to 1 .",
    "hence the tensor components are each computable in poly time by the fkt algorithm .",
    "matchgates are essentially these tensors with some additional technical modifications ( valiant 2002 , 2007 ) whose specification we will omit here",
    ". suffice it to say that the full definition is chosen so that a circuit of matchgates , representing contraction of a matchgate tensor network , corresponds to the problem of evaluating the match sum of @xmath78 where @xmath78 ( with possibly some residual uncontracted input and output vertices ) is the graph obtained from the graphs of the individual matchgates by identifying ( or `` glueing along '' ) input and output vertices that are contracted in the tensor network .",
    "it follows that the components of the contraction are computable in poly time too .",
    "this is essentially the content of valiant s so - called holant theorem ( valiant 2007 ) .",
    "the expression and clarification of the holant theorem in terms of tensor contractions ( and its invariance under appropriate basis changes in representing the tensors ) was developed in a series of works by cai and choudhary 2006a , b .",
    "for some choices of graphs and weights ( with equal numbers @xmath79 of input and output nodes ) the matchgate tensors can be _ unitary _ i.e. unitary operations on @xmath23 qubits .",
    "hence the above formalism leads to a class of quantum circuits ( comprising unitary matchgates ) that can be classically efficiently simulated .",
    "for example it may be shown ( valiant 2002 ) that the unitary gates @xmath0 in eq .",
    "( [ gab ] ) arise as matchgates with 2 input and 2 output vertices .",
    "the fkt algorithm ( kasteleyn 1961 , temperley and fisher 1961 and jerrum 2003 ) proceeds by setting up a suitable antisymmetric incidence matrix @xmath2 of the graph s weights and then computing @xmath80 as the pfaffian of @xmath2 ( which in fact equals @xmath81 ) . like the determinant of an arbitrary matrix ,",
    "the definition of pfaffian of an antisymmetric matrix is an expression involving exponentially many terms a priori yet computable on polynomial time .",
    "it is known that pfaffians also occur in the mathematical formalism of fermionic quantum physics which suggests that there may be some relationship ( or at least some form of translation of basic problems ) between fermionic physics and perfect matchings in graphs .",
    "indeed soon after the appearance of valiant s work ( valiant 2002 ) on classical simulation of matchgate quantum circuits , knill 2001 and terhal and divincenzo 2002 provided an interpretation of it in terms of fermionic quantum gates and this formalism was subsequently further developed by bravyi 2005 , 2008 .",
    "we now return to developing a formalism for treating theorem [ one ] and some generalisations . for @xmath29 qubit lines ,",
    "we introduce the set of @xmath82 hermitian operators @xmath83 which satisfy the anti - commutation relations , @xmath84 these relations define a _ clifford algebra _",
    "@xmath85 on @xmath82 generators whose elements are arbitrary complex linear combinations of products of generators .",
    "anti - commuting operators to define the clifford algebra and correspondingly to have @xmath86 symmetry in theorem [ quadh ] below .",
    "however , this extension appears not to lead to a significant generalization of our results . ]",
    "since each generator squares to the identity a general element in the algebra may be expressed as a polynomial of degree at most @xmath87 , @xmath88 ( where the index set @xmath89 may be empty ) .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ cliffcomm ] ) that the monomials in the sum are linearly independent so as a vector space @xmath85 has dimension @xmath90 .",
    "hence ( hermitian ) matrix representations of the @xmath83 s will involve matrices of size @xmath91 .",
    "operators @xmath83 satisfying eq .",
    "( [ cliffcomm ] ) arise in the formalism of fermionic physics where they are known as majorana spinors . in that formalism",
    "we start with a set of operators @xmath92 associated to @xmath29 free fermionic modes , satisfying the standard anti - commutation relations for fermionic creation and annihilation operators : @xmath93 then as a consequence of these relations , the following hermitian operators ( which are fermionic analogues of position and momentum operators ) : @xmath94 satisfy the clifford algebra relations eq .",
    "( [ cliffcomm ] ) .",
    "however we emphasise that in the present paper we are not concerned with the study of free fermions _ per se _ but rather , consideration of general quantum circuit simulation properties , based on the clifford algebra structure , which can also go beyond the fermionic formalism ( such as the statement in theorem [ two ] and results in section [ clops ] below )",
    ".    for theorem [ one ] and generalisations we will ( in later sections ) consider matrix representations of the clifford algebra but we first develop some further abstract algebra .",
