    "the micro - pixel chamber ( @xmath0pic )  @xcite , a type of micro - pattern gaseous detector  @xcite , has been developed in our group at kyoto university . the @xmath0pic features a 400-@xmath0 m pitch with 2-dimensional strip readout coupled with a fast , compact fpga ( field programmable gate array)-based data acquisition system . the 2-dimensional measurement of the @xmath0pic can be extended to three dimensions using an arrangement known generally as a time projection chamber ( tpc ) .",
    "detectors incorporating the @xmath0pic have already been successfully developed for applications ranging from mev gamma - ray astronomy  @xcite to medical imaging  @xcite to small - angle x - ray scattering  @xcite . by adding @xmath5he to the gas mixture ,",
    "such a system becomes an effective thermal neutron area - detector , well suited to neutron radiography at high - intensity neutron sources .",
    "state of the art neutron radiography measurements require detectors capable of high spatial resolutions from several hundreds to tens of micrometers and a wide dynamic range for good image contrast .",
    "commonly used neutron imaging detectors satisfying these requirements include imaging plates  @xcite and ccd ( charge - coupled device)-based systems  @xcite .",
    "imaging plates ( ip ) are capable of spatial resolutions down to 25  @xmath0 m , while ccd systems generally achieve resolutions around 100  @xmath0 m .",
    "each of these detector types also features a wide dynamic range ( on the order of 10@xmath6 ) and good linearity in response to intensity . on the other hand ,",
    "read - out times can be long , particularly in the case of ips , which must be removed from the beam and scanned after each measurement .",
    "another drawback of these integrating - type detectors is a background proportional to measurement time , with no means of separating the neutron- and gamma - induced events .    to take full advantage of the new generation of high - intensity , pulsed spallation neutron sources and time - resolved radiographic techniques such as",
    "bragg - edge transmission and resonance imaging , a detector which also possesses good time resolution and good discrimination against gammas is essential . at pulsed sources ,",
    "the energy of an incident neutron is determined by measuring the time between the initiation of the pulse and the neutron s arrival at the detector ( referred to as the time - of - flight , or tof ) .",
    "this requires a time resolution generally on the order of microseconds .",
    "ips are not suitable for measuring neutron tof since typical exposure times are on the order of seconds or greater . in the case of ccds , it is possible to achieve frame rates on the order of khz ( down to @xmath70.1  ms per frame )  @xcite , but the ability to measure neutron tof remains limited .",
    "the gamma sensitivity of the ips and ccds is also an issue , since gammas are produced in copious amounts at spallation sources .",
    "our @xmath0pic - based detector was able to overcome the limitations of ip and ccd systems , while maintaining many of their good characteristics .",
    "this stems from the fact that the @xmath0pic is a counting - type detector ( i.e. , each neutron interaction is measured individually , or counted ) .",
    "our prototype detector was able to assign a time for each event with a resolution down to 0.6  @xmath0s , which is adequate for separating neutrons by tof at pulsed sources .",
    "also , examination of the properties of each event ( track length , energy deposition , etc . ) provided a powerful means for rejecting background on an event - by - event basis , resulting in an effective gamma sensitivity of @xmath810@xmath4 while maintaining robust , stable neutron identification under varying detector conditions .",
    "the detailed event - by - event tracking also allowed our prototype neutron detector to achieve a spatial resolution of @xmath3  @xmath0 m .",
    "the detector has a neutron detection efficiency of up to 35% for thermal neutrons with a peak efficiency of 75% for cold neutrons ( from simulation ) .    for a similar @xmath0pic - based x - ray imaging detector ,",
    "a dynamic range comparable to ips and ccd systems of 10@xmath6 was observed  @xcite , and with our prototype detector , good linearity versus incident intensity was confirmed for data rates up to 9  mhz ( corresponding to @xmath7@xmath9  neutrons / s )  @xcite . [ the data rate in ref .",
    "@xcite ( 4.5  mhz ) is quoted _ per memory port _ and should be multiplied by two for the total data rate . ]",
    "the maximum data rate was limited by the data acquisition hardware and can be increased by as much as a factor of 10 or more ( as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : daq ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath0pic , manufactured via inexpensive printed - circuit board technology , allows freedom to tailor the size and shape for a particular application , up to a maximum size of @xmath10  @xmath2 .",
    "larger areas can be accommodated by tiling detectors , with dead space between the individual @xmath0pics as small as a few millimeters and , since the underlying anode structure remains unchanged , suffering no degradation in the operating characteristics with increasing area .",
    "thus , our @xmath0pic - based detector can combine a moderate spatial resolution , good time resolution , low gamma sensitivity , and large detection area with a wide dynamic range and high rate capability .    in the present paper ,",
    "we describe the prototype detector and fpga - based data acquisition system , as well as the analysis method for the resulting data .",
    "this is followed by a discussion of the gamma rejection capability , spatial resolution , and long - term operation of the detector .",
    "neutron detection was achieved via the absorption reaction , @xmath5he(@xmath11)@xmath5h , which has a large cross - section for thermal neutrons ( 5,330  barns at @xmath12  mev ) and a q - value of 764  kev .",
    "owing to this large energy deposition and overall track lengths around 1  cm in the gas of the detector , the resulting proton - triton pairs were easily detected by the @xmath0pic with gas gains as low as a few hundred .",
    "( for comparison , note that the @xmath0pic has achieved stable operation for gas gains up to 6000  @xcite . ) as typical neutron energies used in radiography measurements are negligible compared to the energy released in the detection reaction , the neutron interactions result in events with similar track lengths and energy deposition , allowing for easy separation from most backgrounds .",
    "the negligible energy of the incident neutron also means the proton and triton emerge effectively back - to - back , but as the range of the proton is @xmath73 times greater than that of the heavier triton ( from simple kinematics ) , separation of the two particles is essential for an accurate determination of the neutron interaction point . by measuring the energy deposition _ along",
    "_ the track , the proton and triton can often be cleanly separated , facilitating a substantial improvement in spatial resolution .",
    "the feasibility of detecting neutrons with the @xmath0pic and distinguishing protons and tritons via energy deposition was demonstrated in a previous experiment  @xcite . in the prototype system ,",
    "the energy deposit at each hit point was estimated using the time - over - threshold method , which measures the width ( in time ) of an analog pulse at a given threshold voltage  @xcite .",
    "measuring the energy deposition in this way also gave another handle for rejecting background events .",
    "for the current study , we constructed a dedicated neutron imaging detector prototype ( shown in fig .",

    "the sides of the drift cage were etched with 0.5-mm copper lines at a 5-mm pitch , and the drift plane and each successive copper line were connected via a chain of 50  m@xmath13 resistors .",
    "electric field strengths ranged from 250 @xmath7 800  v / cm , the optimum value depending on the particular gas mixture and pressure .",

    "a simulation of the prototype detector was created using the geant4 software toolkit  @xcite , and included the relevant physical processes ( scattering , absorption , multiple scattering , electron diffusion , etc . ) .",
    "the simulation also emulated the response of the @xmath0pic and data acquisition hardware to produce data identical in structure to the real system , which was then analyzed with the same software as the real data ( described in sec .",

    "the 5-cm drift cage gives a value of 35% for thermal neutrons ( @xmath12  mev ) and a peak efficiency of 75% at 0.7  mev .",
    "a drift height of 2.5  cm effectively halves the efficiency , resulting in a value of 18% for thermal neutrons . the large drop in efficiency below a neutron energy of about 1  mev in the 2.5-cm case is a result of absorption in the space between the entrance window and drift plane , resulting in an attenuation of the incident beam that increases with decreasing neutron energy . for comparison ,",

    "the asds produce an lvds ( low voltage differential signaling ) digital level whenever the analog signal from a strip crosses a common threshold voltage .",
    "these digitized signals were then sent to an fpga encoder module to be synchronized with a 100-mhz internal clock and the position and time encoded into a 32-bit data word  @xcite .",
    "the encoded data was then sent over two 50-mhz parallel transfer lines to a vme memory module with a total capacity of 64  mb ( 16.8  mwords ) , where they were read out to a pc and saved for further analysis .",
    "this system was originally developed for use with low - rate @xmath0pic - based gamma imaging detectors . in high - rate environments ,",
    "the encoder - to - vme - memory transfer creates a bottleneck , limiting the maximum data rate to @xmath710  mhz ( 1  hz @xmath17 1 word / s ) .",
    "this maximum data rate could be increased an order of magnitude by employing multiple encoder modules transferring data directly to pc over gigabit ethernet .",
    "for example , using four such encoder modules ( each handling 128 strips ) would give an effective transfer rate of 4",

    "[ fig : ngsep ] and subtracting the number of background counts observed for the same conditions .",
    "the resulting negative numbers , as shown in table  [ tbl : gcont ] , are due to variations in the background cosmic - ray rate , limited statistics due to the overall low background rate , and slight variations in the @xmath0pic gain over time . in light of this ,",
    "the final results are given as upper limits determined in a way that accounts for the physical constraint that the rates can not be less than zero  @xcite .",
    "after normalizing to the total number of gammas detected per hour , gamma contamination fractions of @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( 95% confidence level ) were found for the data shown in figs .",

    "furthermore , from the results of fig .",
    "[ fig : cpsvg ] for the gamma rates after track length and pts cuts , we estimated that a decrease in the gas gain to around 275 would reduce the gamma sensitivity by another three orders of magnitude , resulting in an effective gamma sensitivity on the order of @xmath59 or less with no change in neutron efficiency .",

    "[ fig : cd](a ) , the pulse - width information was disregarded , and the neutron position was taken as the mid - point of the proton - triton track ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 in eq .",

    "the resolution was estimated by fitting the projection of a straight edge ( sometimes referred to as a _ knife - edge target _ ) with the function :    @xmath60 + c,\\ ] ]    derived assuming a gaussian resolution , where @xmath61 is a normalization factor , erf@xmath62 is the usual gaussian error function , @xmath0 is the mean position of the edge , @xmath53 is the corresponding gaussian width , and @xmath63 is a constant . using the right - most vertical edge of the test chart , the resolution was found as @xmath64  @xmath0 m .",
    "this is in good agreement with a previous test experiment carried out by our group in september 2008 at the nop beamline of the jrr-3 reactor in tokai , japan , using a @xmath0pic - based x - ray imaging detector modified to detect neutrons ( by adding a small amount of @xmath5he to the usual gas mixture )  @xcite . this previous experiment , which used an older version of the fpga firmware without the time - over - threshold measurement capability , found a spatial resolution of about 956  @xmath0 m .",
    "( the @xmath0pic and daq hardware were essentially identical to that used for the current prototype . )    using the pulse - width information available in the current data , the image quality was greatly improved ( fig .",

    "the spatial resolution was again determined via eq .",
    "[ eqn : fit ] and was found to be @xmath65  @xmath0 m , representing an improvement by a factor of 2.8 . to achieve this spatial resolution ,",
    "the events were limited to those in which the proton and triton were visible in both the anode and cathode clusters ( pts cut ) . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : ptsep ] ( and confirmed in table  [ tbl : cddata ] ) , such events account for only about 35% of all neutron events , resulting in a combined neutron efficiency for the image of @xmath710% for thermal neutrons . when all events passing the energy and track - length cuts are included in the image , the spatial resolution becomes @xmath66  @xmath0 m , which , although still an improvement over the case with no position correction , is about 50% worse than the best resolution .",
    "thus , a trade - off must be made between resolution and efficiency .",
    "the distortion apparent on the left side of fig .",
    "[ fig : cd](b ) is a result of beam divergence , which produces a smearing of the image that increases with the distance from the beam center . as with the time resolution discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : tl ] , this was a result of our inability to measure the absolute position of an event above the surface of the @xmath0pic . while the effect is clearly visible on the left of the image , it was estimated via simulation to increase the observed spatial resolution by only about 1% at the edge used in the above determination ( well within errors ) .",
    "this smearing can be reduced by optimizing the beam geometry to minimize divergence and by decreasing the drift height to reduce the uncertainty in the interaction position .",
    "the latter point led us to change from the 5-cm drift cage to the 2.5-cm cage used in previous sections .",
    "improvement of the spatial resolution can be attained with more sophisticated position reconstruction algorithms incorporating the shape of the pulse - width distribution ( as in ref .",
    "@xcite for x - ray imaging with the @xmath0pic ) .",
    "preliminary results for our neutron detector suggest nearly a factor of 3 improvement in the resolution is possible  @xcite .",
    "further improvement is expected through optimization of the gas mixture and pressure , although , according to our geant4 simulation , the spatial resolution is ultimately limited to between 90 and 100  @xmath0 m by the underlying pixel - pitch .",
    "our simulation showed that this maximal value is achieved for a gas mixture with a diffusion constant about half the current mixture or one with a track length around 5  mm .",
    "for the latter , shorter track lengths ( down to a minimum of @xmath73  mm for which the proton and triton can be effectively separated ) would reduce the amount of data per event but would also yield a smaller range of usable track angles and a reduced reconstruction efficiency . a trade - off",
    "is thus affected between spatial resolution , efficiency , and maximum neutron rate .",
    "these ongoing studies will be explored in a subsequent paper .      at a time when the demand for @xmath5he is already outstripping the world s supply  @xcite ,",
    "it is important to consider the @xmath5he usage of the detector . over time , various processes , such as dissociation of the quencher gas and outgassing from the materials of the detector , lead to a buildup of impurities and a degradation in the properties of the gas . to maintain the desired gas properties ,",
    "the detector must be periodically evacuated and refilled .",
    "to date , the prototype detector has been filled two times with the gas mixture described in this paper .",
    "the first filling was used for a period of 13 months , and the second has been used up to the present ( @xmath714 months ) .",
    "the gas gain slowly diminished over each fill period , decreasing by 68% during the first and by 30% during the second .",
    "also , the initial value of the second filling was 56% that of the first , perhaps indicating some additional aging process of the @xmath0pic . in each case , however , sufficient gain for neutron detection could still be attained by increasing the anode voltage setting , with no significant change observed in detector performance over time .",
    "a one - year fill cycle is already long when compared to other @xmath0pic applications , which , due to the need to operate at much higher gains , must be refilled every few months . by treating the vessel and @xmath0pic against outgassing through annealing ( not done for our prototype ) and employing a gas filtration system , such as one now under development in our group at kyoto university  @xcite",
    ", it should be possible to stabilize the gas gains over time and extend the operation of the detector significantly .",
    "if these improvements can be realized , the yearly costs for detector maintenance would be greatly reduced .",
    "we have developed a time - resolved neutron imaging detector based on the @xmath0pic micro - pixel chamber . by measuring the energy deposition ( via time - over - threshold ) and track positions",
    ", we were able to demonstrate a small effective gamma sensitivity of @xmath810@xmath4 and neutron identification that was stable and robust . a spatial resolution of @xmath7350  @xmath0 m was achieved , with significant improvements expected through the use of more sophisticated reconstruction algorithms and optimization of the gas mixture .",
    "a time resolution as low as 0.6  @xmath0s allows for clean separation of neutrons by time - of - flight at pulsed neutron sources .",
    "the detector , operated at a moderate pressure of a few atmospheres , was able to maintain its good operating characteristics for more than one year on a single gas filling .",
    "the compact fpga - based data acquisition system is simple to setup and operate and , although limited to a maximum neutron rate of @xmath7150  kcps , could potentially support a rate 10 times that by upgrading the encoder - to - pc data transfer method .",
    "furthermore , the printed - circuit board manufacturing process is inexpensive and allows some freedom to choose the size and shape of the @xmath0pic to suit a particular experiment ( up to a maximum size of @xmath10  @xmath2 ) , and larger areas can be covered by tiling detectors with no degradation in the operating characteristics with increased area .",
    "these properties make the @xmath0pic an attractive solution for neutron imaging applications requiring very low background , time - resolved measurements , and the ability to cover large areas at moderate resolution .",
    "this work was supported by the quantum beam technology program of the japan ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology ( mext ) .",
    "the authors would like to thank the staff at j - parc and the materials and life science facility for providing a stable neutron beam during our test experiment in november 2009 ."
