    "<S> recent studies on a related class of replicator equations , where an initial random graph evolves towards a highly non - random network , revealed remarkable self - organized features [ 2 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> a classical result on randomly wired ecosystems [ 3 ] shows that a critical limit to the number of species @xmath4 exists for a given connectivity @xmath10 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath10 is the fraction of non - zero matrix elements . </S>",
    "<S> this limit is sharp ( a phase transition ) : below the critical value the system is stable but it becomes unstable otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> the basic inequality is that the community will be stable if @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a given constant . here </S>",
    "<S> the equality defines the boundaries between the stable and the unstable domains . </S>",

    "<S> most of these approaches based on self - organized criticality ( soc ) , such as the bak - sneppen model [ 5 ] , involve a time scale that is assumed to be very large . </S>",
    "<S> but the species properties of a given ecosystem do not change appreciably on a smaller time scale [ 7 ] and several field observations suggest that real ecosystems display some features characteristic of soc states . in particular : </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) the analysis of time series [ 8 ] shows that the largest lyapunov exponent is typically close to zero ; ( ii ) studies on colonization in islands show that after a critical number of species is reached , extinction events are triggered , following a power law distribution [ 9 ] ; ( iii ) the lifetime distribution of species ( defined in terms of local extinction in given areas ) is also a power law @xmath15 with @xmath16 [ 9 ] to @xmath17 [ 10 ] and ( iv ) in species - rich ecosystems , the number of species @xmath18 with @xmath19 individuals is also a power law @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is close to one , although log - normal distributions with long tails are also well known [ 11 ] . but none of these observations ( together with the @xmath22 law ) have been explained within a single theoretical framework .    </S>",
    "<S> in this letter we present a new model which can be used as a simple alternative to the lv formulation and follows the simple ( but somewhat different ) approach of other studies on random graphs [ 2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the model involves a set @xmath23 of @xmath4 ( possible ) species and a population size @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> individuals of different species interact through a matrix @xmath25 , with a pre - defined connectivity @xmath26 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath27 are randomly chosen from a uniform distribution @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> each time step two individuals are taken at random belonging , say , to species @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> then if @xmath31 the individual belonging to @xmath30 is replaced , with probability @xmath32 , by a new individual of species @xmath29 . if @xmath33 then nothing happens . </S>",
    "<S> this rule is repeated @xmath24 times and these @xmath24 updates define our time step . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , with probability @xmath34 , any individual can be replaced by another individual of _ any _ of the species from @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> these rules makes our model close to equation ( 1 ) when @xmath35 ( @xmath4-species competition model [ 1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> so two basic reactions are allowed : ( i ) interaction through @xmath25 and ( ii ) random replacement by a new species from the @xmath23 pool . </S>",
    "<S> the second rule introduces immigration ( at a rate @xmath34 ) : our driving force [ 12,13 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> an example of the temporal dynamics of this model is shown in figure 1 , where we can see a wide spectrum of fluctuation sizes , not very different from those observed in some natural communities [ 1,8 ] . </S>",
    "<S> starting from any given initial number of species , this model self - organizes towards a subset of species ( with average @xmath36 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the specific subset itself changes in time . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath37 be the probability of having two species connected . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath37 and @xmath36 are linked by a power law @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> once this @xmath36 is reached , complex fluctuations can arise and under some conditions ( see below ) power laws are observable . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the population fluctuations typically shows , for small driving @xmath34 and large enough @xmath0 , a power law @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath40 when @xmath41 and @xmath42 an exponential cut - off . </S>",
    "<S> the lifetime distribution of species is also a power law : @xmath43 and for @xmath44 , @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath46 limit corresponds to low - level connectivities ( i.e. random - walk - like behavior ) and @xmath47 to the situation were interactions dominate over immigration . </S>",
    "<S> it is remarkable that these limits in the lifetimes correspond to those reported from field studies [ 9,10 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the limiting case for @xmath48 shows the exact hyperbolic relation and can be derived from a mean - field approach . </S>",
    "<S> it is not difficult to see that the number of species will change in time following : @xmath49 where the first term on the right - hand side stands for the continuous introduction of new species at a rate @xmath34 and the second for the instability derived from interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the previous equation gives an exponential approach to criticality @xmath50/c^*$ ] which leads at the steady state to @xmath51    a mean field theory of species abundance can be derived . </S>",
    "<S> let us start with the master equation for this model . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath52 is the probability ( for any species ) of having @xmath19 individuals at time t , the one - step process is described by [ 14 ] : @xmath53 where the one - step transition rates are : @xmath54 @xmath55 from ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) we see that @xmath56 and @xmath57 and we define @xmath58 and @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> the stationary distribution @xmath60 is obtained from @xmath61 using standard methods [ 14 ] namely by writing @xmath62 and using the normalization condition @xmath63 , to show that @xmath64 here @xmath65 and @xmath66 , where @xmath67 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> this sum takes the form of a jacobi polynomial @xmath68 [ 15 ] , with @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , which can itself be expressed in terms of gamma functions for this value of @xmath72 . therefore using @xmath73 , the stationary , </S>",
    "<S> normalized solution can be written in the form [ 16 ] @xmath74 as the connectivity ( or the immigration rate ) increases , the distributions changes from gaussian to lognormal and to power laws ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is expected since very small connectivities will make interactions irrelevant , with fluctuations dominated by random events . </S>",
    "<S> we can simplify ( 9 ) in the region of interest : @xmath24 and @xmath4 large , and @xmath75 where @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> if in addition @xmath77 , which corresponds to @xmath34 small : @xmath78 , we get a scaling relation : @xmath79 where @xmath80 in agreement with simulations and field data . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest a simple link between a range of statistical distributions from those generated by multiplicative events to those related with soc dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> from this solution we can compute the stationary number of species @xmath81 and find the relation between this quantity and the probability of having two species connected , @xmath37 . under the same conditions that led to ( 10 ) , we find that @xmath82 [ 17 ] which in this parameter range gives @xmath83 . substituting in the expression for @xmath84 gives @xmath85 \\approx { \\cal a } ( c^*)^{-1+\\epsilon(\\mu)}\\ ,   \\eqno(12)\\ ] ] where @xmath86 is given by @xmath87 and @xmath88 is a constant equal to @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> the additional conditions under which ( 12 ) hold are @xmath90 and @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter means that @xmath37 may not be taken too small , for example , if @xmath92 then @xmath93 . with these values </S>",
    "<S> the former condition is satisfied if @xmath94 is not too large . </S>",
    "<S> thus ( 12 ) holds for a wide range of parameter values . </S>",
    "<S> the relation between @xmath36 and @xmath37 is shown in figure 3 for different @xmath95 values and a quite large immigration rate ( @xmath96 ) . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the hyperbolic relation is only reached for large @xmath95 and for smaller @xmath95 values , slower decays ( i. e. @xmath97 ) are obtained [ 18 ] .    in summary , a simple @xmath4-species network model that shows both lognormal ( even gaussian ) distributions as well as soc dynamics has been introduced . starting from random initial conditions </S>",
    "<S> , the system evolves towards a state characterized by some well - defined scaling laws and statistical features . </S>",
    "<S> high immigration , small @xmath95 relations or low connectivities lead to lognormal distributions . </S>",
    "<S> these are replaced by well - defined power laws as the interactions become more relevant . in the last case , </S>",
    "<S> a multiplicity of metastable states , the presence of a threshold in the number of species @xmath98 , the scale separation between the driving when @xmath34 is small and the system response fully describe our system as soc . as a consequence of critical dynamics </S>",
    "<S> several well - known field observations are recovered . </S>",
    "<S> the interpretation of this model provides a new framework for understanding how complex dynamics emerge in multispecies ecosystems and suggest that some well - known time series from natural communities would be the result of criticality instead of deterministic chaotic behavior .    </S>",
