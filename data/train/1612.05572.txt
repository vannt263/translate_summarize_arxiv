    "the first code - based cryptosystem was proposed by mceliece in 1978 .",
    "this system , which can be seen as a general encryption setting for coding theory , is based on a hidden trapdoor associated to a decodable family of codes , hence a strongly structured family of codes .",
    "the inherent construction of the system makes it difficult to formally reduce security to the generic difficulty of decoding random codes .",
    "even if the original mceliece cryptosystem , based on the family of goppa codes , is still considered secure today , many variants based on alternative families of codes ( reed - solomon codes , reed - muller codes or some alternant codes @xcite ) were broken by recovering in polynomial time the hidden structure @xcite .",
    "the fact that the hidden code structure may be uncovered ( even possibly for goppa codes ) lies like a sword of damocles over the system , and finding a practical alternative cryptosystem based on the difficulty of decoding unstructured or random codes has always been a major issue in code - based cryptography .",
    "the recently proposed mdpc cryptosystem @xcite ( somewhat in the spirit of the ntru cryptosystem @xcite ) addresses the problem by using a hidden code structure which is significantly weaker than that of previously used algebraic codes like goppa codes .",
    "the cryptosystem @xcite followed this trend with a similar approach . beside this weak hidden structure",
    ", the mdpc system has very nice features and in particular relatively small key sizes , because of the cyclic structure of the public matrix .",
    "however , even if this system is a strong step forward for code - based cryptography , the hidden structure issue has not altogether disappeared .    in 2003 , alekhnovich proposed an innovative approach based on the difficulty of decoding purely random codes  @xcite . in this system",
    "the trapdoor ( or secret key ) is a random error vector that has been added to a random codeword of a random code .",
    "recovering the secret key is therefore equivalent to solving the problem of decoding a random code  with no hidden structure .",
    "alekhnovich also proved that breaking the system in any way , not necessarily by recovering the secret key , involves decoding a random linear code .    even if the system was not totally practical , the approach in itself was a breakthrough for code - based cryptography .",
    "its inspiration was provided in part by the ajtai - dwork cryptosystem @xcite which is based on solving hard lattice problems .",
    "the ajtai - dwork cryptosystem also inspired the learning with errors ( lwe ) lattice - based cryptosystem by regev @xcite which generated a huge amount of work in lattice - based cryptography .",
    "attempts to emulate this approach in code - based cryptography were also made and systems based on the learning parity with noise ( lpn ) have been proposed by exploiting the analogy with lwe @xcite : the lpn problem is essentially the problem of decoding random linear codes of fixed dimension and unspecified length over a binary symmetric channel .",
    "the first version of the lwe cryptosystem was not very efficient , but introducing more structure in the public key ( as for ntru ) lead to the very efficient ring - lwe cryptosystem @xcite .",
    "one strong feature of this last paper is that it gives a reduction from the decisional version of the ring - lwe problem to a search version of the problem .",
    "such a reduction is not known for the case of the ring - lpn problem .",
    "a ring version ( ring - lpn ) was nevertheless introduced in @xcite for authentication and for encryption in @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose an efficient cryptosystem based on the difficulty of decoding random quasi - cyclic codes .",
    "it is inspired by ring - lwe encryption but is significantly adapted to the coding theory setting .",
    "our construction benefits from some nice features : a reduction to a decisional version of the general problem of decoding random quasi - cyclic codes , hence with no hidden structure , and also quite good parameters and efficiency .",
    "since our approach is relatively general , it can also be used with other metrics such as the rank metric .",
    "finally , another strong feature of our approach is that inherently it leads to a precise analysis of the decryption failure probability , which is also a hard point for the mdpc cryptosystem and is not done in detail for other approaches based on the lpn problem .",
    "a relative weakness of our system is its relatively low encryption rate , but this is not a major issue for classical applications of public - key encryption schemes such as authentication or key exchange .",
    "we propose the first efficient code - based cryptosystem whose security relies on decoding small weight vectors of random quasi - cyclic codes .",
    "we provide a reduction of our cryptosystem to this problem together with a detailed analysis of the decryption failure probability .",
    "our analysis allows us to give small parameters for code - based encryption in hamming and rank metrics . when compared to the mdpc  @xcite or lrpc  @xcite cryptosystems , our proposal offers higher security ( in terms of security bits ) and better decryption guarantees for similar parameters ( i.e. key and communication size ) , but with a lower encryption rate .",
    "overall we propose concrete parameters for different levels of security , in both the classical and quantum settings .",
    "these parameters show the great potential of rank metric for cryptography especially for higher security settings . when compared to the ring - lpn based cryptosystem @xcite our system has better parameters with factors @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively for the size of the ciphertext and the size of the public key . we also give a general table comparing the different asymptotic sizes for different code - based cryptosystems .",
    "our cryptosystem is based on two codes . a first code @xmath5 $ ] , for which an efficient decoding algorithm @xmath6 is known .",
    "the code @xmath7 together with its generator matrix @xmath8 are publicly known .",
    "the second code is a @xmath9 $ ] random double - circulant code in systematic form , with generator matrix @xmath10 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : rot ] ) for the definition of * rot*(@xmath11 ) ) . the general idea of the system is that the double - circulant code is used to generate some noise , which can be handled and decoded by the code @xmath7 .",
    "the system can be seen as a noisy adaptation of the elgamal cryptosystem .",
    "the secret key for our cryptosystem is a _ short _",
    "vector @xmath12 ( for some metric ) , whose syndrome @xmath13 is appended to the public key @xmath14 . to encrypt a message @xmath15 belonging to some plaintext space ,",
    "it is first encoded through the generator matrix @xmath8 , then hidden using the syndrome @xmath16 and an additional short vector @xmath17 to prevent information leakage . in other words , encrypting a message simply consists in providing a noisy encoding of it with a particular shape .",
    "formally , the ciphertext is @xmath18 , for a short random vector @xmath19 and @xmath20 for some natural operator @xmath11 defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : preliminaries ] . the legitimate recipient can obtain a noisy version of the plaintext @xmath21 using his secret key @xmath22 and then recover the ( noiseless ) plaintext using the efficient decoding algorithm @xmath23 .    for correctness , all previous constructions based on a mceliece approach rely on the fact that the error term added to the encoding of",
    "the message is less than or equal to the decoding capability of the code being used . in our construction , this assumption is no longer required and the correctness of our cryptosystem is guaranteed assuming the legitimate recipient can remove sufficiently many errors from the noisy encoding @xmath24 of the message using .",
    "the above discussion leads to the study of the probability that a decoding error occurs , which would yield a decryption failure .",
    "we study the typical weight of the error vector @xmath25 that one needs to decode in order to decrypt ( see sec .",
    "[ sec:5-analysis ] for details ) . with the reasonable assumption , backed up by simulations , that the weight of @xmath25 behaves in a way that is close to a binomial distribution",
    ", we manage a precise estimation of a decoding failure and hence calibrate coding parameters accordingly .",
    "* comparison with the mceliece framework . * in the mceliece encryption framework , a hidden code is considered .",
    "this leads to two important consequences : first , the security depends on hiding the structure of the code , and second , the decryption algorithm consists of decoding the hidden code which can not be changed .",
    "this yields different instantiations depending on the choice of the hidden code , many of which succumb to attacks and few of which resist .    in our framework",
    "there is not one unique hidden code , but two independent codes : the random double - circulant structure guarantees the security of the scheme , and the public code @xmath7 guarantees correct decryption .",
    "it makes it possible to consider public families of codes which are difficult to hide but very efficient for decoding : also it requires finding a tradeoff for the code @xmath7 , between decoding efficiency and practical decoding complexity .",
    "but unlike the mceliece scheme , where the decryption code is fixed , it can be changed depending on the application .",
    "the global decryption failure for our scheme depends on the articulation between the error - vector distribution induced by the double - circulant code and the decoding algorithm @xmath6 . after having studied the error - vector distribution for the hamming metric we associate it with a particular code adapted to low rates and bit error probability of order @xmath26 .",
    "notice that the system could possibly be used for greater encryption rate at the cost of higher parameters .",
    "this led us to choose tensor product codes , the composition of two linear codes .",
    "tensor product codes are defined ( def .",
    "[ def : tensor ] ) in sec .",
    "[ sec:6-low - rate ] , and a detailed analysis of the decryption failure probability for such codes is provided there .",
    "for the rank metric case , we consider gabidulin codes and the case when the error - vector is always decodable , with zero decryption failure probability .",
    "* comparison with the lwe / lpn approach . * our scheme may be considered as a special instance of the general lwe / lpn methodology , as described , for example , in the recent paper @xcite .",
    "as is mentioned there , even though full lwe - based schemes may , given current knowledge , be asymptotically more efficient than their lpn counterparts , there is still significant appeal in providing a workable variation over the more simple binary field ( as it was done with ring - lwe for the lwe setting ) .",
    "this was previously attempted in @xcite by relying on the ring - lpn problem .",
    "one of the drawbacks of this last work is to be limited to rings of the form @xmath27/(p(x))$ ] that are extension fields of @xmath28 .",
    "in contrast , we suggest using @xmath29/(x^n-1)$ ] , which reduces security to a decoding problem for quasi - cyclic codes and draws upon coding theory s experience of using this family of codes .",
    "quasi - cyclic codes have indeed been studied for a long time by coding - theorists , and many of the records for minimum distance are held by quasi - cyclic codes .",
    "however , no efficient generic decoding algorithm for quasi - cyclic codes has been found , lending faith to the assumption that decoding random quasi - cyclic codes is a hard algorithmic problem . also , this particular setting also allows us to obtain very good parameters compared to the approach of @xcite with at least a factor 10 for the size of the keys and messages departing from the strict lwe / lpn paradigm also enabled us to derive a security reduction to decoding quasi - cyclic codes and arguably gives us more flexibility for the error model .",
    "notably the rank - metric variation that we introduce has not been investigated before in the lwe / lpn setting , and looks very promising . as mentioned before , one of its features is that it enables a zero error probability of incorrect decryption .",

    "<S> we propose a framework for constructing efficient code - based encryption schemes from codes that do not hide any structure in their public matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the framework is in the spirit of the schemes first proposed by alekhnovich in 2003 and based on the difficulty of decoding random linear codes from random errors of low weight . </S>",
    "<S> we depart somewhat from aleknovich s approach and propose an encryption scheme based on the difficulty of decoding random quasi - cyclic codes . </S>",
    "<S> we propose two new cryptosystems instantiated within our framework : the hamming quasi - cyclic cryptosystem ( hqc ) , based on the hamming metric , and the rank quasi - cyclic cryptosystem ( rqc ) , based on the rank metric . </S>",
    "<S> we give a security proof , which reduces the ind - cpa security of our systems to a decisional version of the well known problem of decoding random families of quasi - cyclic codes for the hamming and rank metrics ( the respective qcsd and rqcsd problems ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also provide an analysis of the decryption failure probability of our scheme in the hamming metric case : for the rank metric there is no decryption failure . </S>",
    "<S> our schemes benefit from a very fast decryption algorithm together with small key sizes of only a few thousand bits . </S>",
    "<S> the cryptosystems are very efficient for low encryption rates and are very well suited to key exchange and authentication . </S>",
    "<S> asymptotically , for @xmath0 the security parameter , the public key sizes are respectively in @xmath1 for hqc and in @xmath2 for rqc . </S>",
    "<S> practical parameter compares well to systems based on ring - lpn or the recent mdpc system .    </S>",
    "<S> code - based cryptography , public - key encryption , post - quantum cryptography , provable security </S>"
