    "the study of hadron structure and the spectrum of hadron resonances is one of the most important issues and is attracting much attention .",
    "recently , the topic of meson - baryon states , with mesons and baryons governed by strong interactions , is well developed by the combination of the chiral lagrangians with nonperturbative unitary techniques in coupled channels , which has been a very fruitful scheme to study the nature of many hadron resonances .",
    "the analysis of meson - baryon and meson - meson scattering amplitudes shows poles in the second riemanm sheet , which are identified with existing hadron resonances or new ones . in this way",
    "the low - lying @xmath8 resonances are generated  @xcite , including the @xmath9  @xcite and two @xmath10 states  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the low - lying @xmath11 states have also been generated from two mesons and a baryon such as the @xmath12 resonance and others  @xcite .    within the chiral unitary approach , the @xmath13 and @xmath14 scalar mesons",
    "are dynamically generated from the interaction of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 treated as coupled channels in @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "both couple strongly to the @xmath15 channel . in this sense",
    "the @xmath13 and @xmath14 scalar mesons can be explained as @xmath20 bound states .",
    "the effective interactions of @xmath21 have been studied in a unitary chiral theory  @xcite and in a phenomenological way  @xcite . within the unitary chiral theory , two @xmath10 states",
    "are dynamically generated , as we mentioned above , the higher mass one corresponding to basically a @xmath21 bound state and the lower mass one looking like a @xmath22 resonance . in the phenomenological approaches ,",
    "the strong attraction of @xmath21 in the @xmath18 sector provides @xmath10 as a bound state of @xmath21 .",
    "recently , there is growing evidence that some existing hadronic states can be interpreted in terms of bound states or resonances of three hadrons .",
    "some new states of this nature have also been reported .",
    "for example , it has been found that the @xmath23 resonance reported in @xmath24 can be interpreted as a @xmath25 bound state  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the faddeev equations for the @xmath26 system were solved by using the chiral unitary approach and coupled channels , and several @xmath27 and @xmath28 resonances with spin - parity @xmath7 in the energy region @xmath29 mev were dynamically generated .",
    "the @xmath30 ( now @xmath31 ) state , claimed by different experimental groups  @xcite in the @xmath32 invariant mass spectrum , has been interpreted as a @xmath33 resonance with @xmath15 forming the @xmath13 scalar meson  @xcite .    for the @xmath0 system , having strong attraction in the @xmath34 and @xmath35 subsystems ,",
    "it is naturally expected that the three hadrons @xmath0 form a hadron state .",
    "indeed , this state has been studied in ref .",

    "@xcite by solving the faddeev equations in a coupled channel approach .",
    "they all found a bound state of the @xmath37 system with total isospin @xmath38 and spin - parity @xmath7 .    in the present work ,",
    "we reinvestigate the three - body @xmath0 system by considering the interaction of the three components among themselves , keeping in mind the expected strong correlations of the @xmath35 and @xmath34 system to make the @xmath39 and @xmath10 respectively . in terms of two - body @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , @xmath43 scattering amplitudes",
    ", we solve the faddeev equations by using the fixed center approximation(fca ) .",
    "the main purpose of the present work is to test the validity of the fca to study systems of three hadrons in conditions similar to the present one .",
    "the fca has been employed before , in particular in the study of the @xmath44 interaction at low energies  @xcite .",
    "comparison of full faddeev equations and the fca can be extracted from refs .",
    "@xcite , where it is shown that the fca is a good approximation for this problem at the level of a few percent .",
    "this approach was also used in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe the @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 resonances as multi-@xmath50 states , and in ref .",
    "@xcite to study the @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and a not yet discovered @xmath55 resonances as @xmath56multi@xmath57 states .",
    "very recently , we gave an interesting explanation of the @xmath58 puzzle by using this approach in the @xmath59 system  @xcite .",
    "one basic feature of the fca is that one has a cluster of two particles and one allows the multiple scattering of the third particle with this cluster , which is supposed not to be changed by the interaction of the third particle .",
    "intuitively one can think that this would mostly happen when the particles in the cluster are more massive than the third one .",
    "one might also think that the approximation could be better if the third particle had small energy , such that it can not perturb too much the cluster of the two particles .",
    "whatever it is , one does not know the accuracy of the fca until a comparison is made with the more elaborate faddeev equations . on the other hand ,",
    "technically , the fca is much easier than the faddeev equations , which require lengthly calculations and also approximations , to the point that some approximations done to make the faddeev equations feasible might introduce larger uncertainties in some problem than those introduced by the fca . with this perspective",
    "it is important to be able to quantify uncertainties of the fca in certain circumstances such that it can be used as a prospective tool to investigate possible structures of three hadrons , leading to bound or quasibound states , in different systems and similar circumstances .",
    "this is the main purpose of the present work .",
    "we shall take advantage that the present problem has been solved with two independent methods , full faddeev equations  @xcite and variational approach  @xcite , such that comparison with the result of these works can give us a feeling of the accuracy of the fca .",
    "in next section , we present the fca formalism and ingredients to analyze the @xmath4 system . in section iii ,",
    "our results and discussions are presented .",
    "finally , conclusions are given in section iv .",
    "we are going to use the fca of the faddeev equations in order to obtain the scattering amplitude of the three body @xmath0 system .",
    "we consider @xmath35 as a bound state of @xmath60 scalar meson in one case , and @xmath34 as a bound state of @xmath10 state in the other , which allows us to use the fca to solve the faddeev equations .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath61 and @xmath62 scattering amplitudes will allow us to study dynamically generated resonances .",
    "the important ingredients in the calculation of the total scattering amplitude for the @xmath0 system using the fca are the two - body @xmath34 , @xmath36 and @xmath15 unitarized @xmath63wave interactions from the chiral unitary approach . since this work has been reported on many occasions , we direct the reader for details to refs .  @xcite .    in the fca approach we need as input the wave function of a two particle cluster and the scattering amplitude of the third particle with those of the clusters .",
    "the wave functions , and the corresponding form factors , are taken from refs .",
    "@xcite , where a quantum mechanical study of the coupled channels interaction is done in a way that gives the same scattering amplitudes as those obtained in the field theoretical treatment of the chiral unitary approach .",
    "one of the ingredients in the calculation is the form factor for the assumed two body cluster , the @xmath13 and @xmath14 in one case , or the @xmath10 in the other . following the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , we can easily get the expression for the form factor @xmath64 for the bound state @xmath65 of a pair of particles   for nucleon , but since we normalize @xmath66 to 1 at @xmath67 , eqs .",

    "we admit that the wave function of the cluster could be modified by the presence of the third particle .",
    "since the interaction is attractive in the present case it should induce a reduction of the size of the cluster  @xcite .",
    "however , unlike in ref .",
    "@xcite where the size of the @xmath83 cluster is mostly determined by the long range of @xmath84 exchange , and its size can be sizeable reduced , in the present case both the @xmath15 and @xmath21 interaction are governed by the exchange of vector mesons ( implicit in the chiral lagrangians and explicitly shown in the local hidden gauge formalism  @xcite ) , thus the size is determined by the constraints of the uncertainty principle , since the range of the interaction is zero . in this case",
    "the presence of the third particle can not reduce the size of the cluster much . in order to quantify uncertainties of the fca ,",
    "we perform calculations for the case where the cluster radius is decreased by @xmath82 .",
    "technically , this is accomplished by increasing @xmath82 the masses of the particles involved in the cluster in eqs .",

    "the external particle 3 interacts successively with the particle 1 and particle 2 which form the bound states . for the case of @xmath61 configuration ,",
    "since the masses of @xmath13 and @xmath14 are equal , the @xmath85 transition should be important to the total three body scattering amplitude , and we consider this transition in our calculation .",
    "then the fca equations for the @xmath61 configuration are written in terms of four partition functions ( @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 for @xmath90 , and @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 for @xmath95 ) , which read , @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the total three - body scattering amplitudes , @xmath99 and @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) account for all the diagrams starting from the interaction of the external particle with particle @xmath102 of the compound system for @xmath90 and @xmath95 , respectively , while @xmath103 and @xmath104 account for the intermediate virtual transition contributions for @xmath85 and @xmath105 , respectively .",
    "hence , @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 represent the corresponding two body ( particle 3 and particle 1 or particle 3 and particle 2 ) unitarized scattering amplitudes . in the above equations ,",
    "@xmath109 is the loop function for the particle 3 propagating inside the compound system which will be discussed later on .        for the case of the @xmath62 configuration ,",
    "since we do not expect other @xmath63wave meson - baryon channels to play any relevant role in the present calculation , the fca equations are written in terms of only two partition functions @xmath86 and @xmath87 , which sum up to the total three body scattering amplitude . in this case",
