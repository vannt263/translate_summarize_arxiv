    "m5-branes are mysterious objects in m theory .",
    "the low energy theories on coincident multiple m5-branes are 6 dimensional @xmath3 theories whose lagrangians are not known . then , one of the methods whom we can use to analyze is the duality .",
    "we consider two m5-branes on @xmath0 ale space .",
    "when two m5-branes are separated by introducing some m2-branes , we can see some 2 dimensional objects in the boundaries of the m2-branes and m5-branes .",
    "we call them `` m - strings '' @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "this configuration is dual to a @xmath4 5-brane web @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath4 5-brane web is dual to the refined topological string @xcite@xcite on a non - compact toric calabi - yau manifold @xcite@xcite .",
    "thus , we can calculate the partition function of m - strings by using the refined topological vertex formalism @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the m - strings have @xmath5 supersymmetry in flat space @xcite .",
    "when we put the m - strings on @xmath0 ale space , the supersymmetry is broken to @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , in order to use the duality to the refined topological string , we consider some deformations by giving masses to the bifundamental hypermultiplets .",
    "these deformations do not break the @xmath6 supersymmetry anymore @xcite . according to @xcite@xcite@xcite",
    ", the partition function of m - strings agrees with the elliptic genus of the supersymmetric gauge theory through the chain of dualities .    in this paper",
    ", we consider one of the web diagrams which is dual to the above situation .",
    "this diagram is also related to the web diagram which is discussed in @xcite under the flop transition @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "we calculate the partition function of m - strings by using the refined topological vertex formalism .",
    "our result is consistent with @xcite@xcite under the flop transition .",
    "then , we find that the supersymmetry of m - strings gets enhanced to @xmath2 by tuning some khler parameters .",
    "such a tuning of the khler parameters is discussed in the literature , for instance as in @xcite    the organization of this paper is as follows : in section [ sec:2 ] , we review two m5-branes on @xmath0 ale space very briefly",
    ". we also introduce the web diagram which corresponds to the m2-m5 brane system .",
    "more detailed discussion about our model is written in @xcite@xcite@xcite . in section [ sec:3 ] , we calculate the partition function by using the refined topological vertex formalism . then , by tuning some khler parameters , we find that the partition function of m - strings in @xmath0 ale space agrees with that in flat space .",
    "this partition function is also coincident with the elliptic genus of the @xmath2 @xmath7 gauge theory for further setting some other khler parameters .",
    "finally , in section [ sec:4 ] , we discuss our results and another possibility of the enhancement of supersymmetry by tuning some khler parameters which are different from the above choices .",
    "consider the m2-m5 brane system on @xmath0 ale space .",
    "we call the boundaries of m2- and m5-branes `` m - strings '' ( see fig . [ system ] )",
    "@xcite . according to a discussion in @xcite ,",
    "the m - strings have @xmath2 supersymmetry in flat space .",
    "however the supersymmetry is broken to @xmath6 on @xmath0 ale space because of orbifolding @xcite .",
    ".the brane setup where @xmath0 ale space is spanned by @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the number of the m2-branes . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      + in this case , the theory on @xmath12 d1-branes is the @xmath1 @xmath7 gauge theory with one adjoint , two chiral multiplets and two fermi multiplets .",
    "if we remove the d5-branes , the theory on @xmath12 d1-branes is the @xmath2 @xmath7 pure gauge theory .",
    "therefore , in terms of duality , removal of the framing corresponds to removal of the d5-branes .",
    "we can generalize this enhancement to the theory on multiple m5-branes on @xmath13 ale space .",
    "this m theory system is dual to the @xmath4 5-brane web which is drawn in fig .",
    "[ general web ] . by using the result in @xcite ,",
    "the partition function of @xmath14 m5 branes on @xmath13 singularity is as follow , @xmath15 where we define @xmath16 and the some parameters @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are defined as follows , @xmath20     and @xmath21 denote the mass deformations and the distance between two ns5-branes , respectively .",
    "the parameters @xmath22 denote the khler parameters along the horizontal direction.,width=604 ]     + if we tune the khler parameters at the fixed @xmath23 , @xmath24 the contribution of @xmath25 , @xmath26 becomes zero unless the young diagram @xmath25 becomes empty .",
    "after several cancellation , the partition function becomes @xmath27 . in terms of this web diagram , this corresponds to remove the @xmath23-th framing by using the geometric transition . in terms of the d1-d5 system on @xmath28 ale space",
    ", this corresponds to remove one of @xmath29 d5-branes .",
    "for example , let us consider @xmath30 case in ( [ setting the kahler parameters ] ) .",
    "then the partition function is @xmath31 here we consider @xmath32 in ( [ partition function for some kahler ] ) . for @xmath32 and @xmath33 , ( [ def ] )",
    "becomes @xmath34 then , the contribution of @xmath32 in ( [ partition function for some kahler ] ) becomes @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , the result is as follows , @xmath36 this partition function is the same as @xmath27 in appropriate redefinitions of the khler parameters .",
    "therefore , by tuning the klert parameters such as ( [ setting the kahler parameters ] ) , the supersymmetry of m - strings gets enhanced to @xmath2 .",
    "in this paper , we have calculated the partition function of m - strings by using the refined topological vertex formalism .",
    "this partition function is consistent with @xcite under the flop transition .",
    "then we have found that , by tuning the khler parameters , the partition function of m - strings has agreed with the @xmath5 partition function of m - strings .",
    "we have interpreted this result by considering the geometric transition .",
    "we have also interpreted this enhancement in terms of d1-d5 brane system on @xmath13 ale space .",
    "now we want to consider another possibility of the enhancement of supersymmetry . as we mentioned in the previous subsection ,",
    "the theory on @xmath12 d1-branes is the @xmath1 @xmath7 gauge theory with one adjoint , two chiral multiplets and two fermi multiplets . by combining @xmath1 vector multiplet with adjoint multiplet , and @xmath1 chiral multiplets with fermi multiplets",
    ", we may be able to obtain @xmath2 vector multiplet and two chiral multiplets .",
    "therefore , we can expect the enhancement of supersymmetry which is different from the one in the previous section .    in order to consider",
    ", we calculate the elliptic genus which can be compared with the m - strings partition function calculated by the refined topological string theory .",
    "the elliptic genus of the gauge theory can be calculated by using the localization method @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "we can write the elliptic genus of the @xmath2 @xmath7 gauge theory with two flavors , @xmath37 where the variable @xmath38 denotes the fugacity .    by calculating as with the reference @xcite , ( [ enhancement ] ) may be written as @xmath39 on the other hand , we rewrite the partition function calculated by the refined topological string , @xmath40 where we define @xmath41 then , we define the partition function of @xmath12 m - strings as follows , @xmath42 then , we find that ( [ locus ] ) is similar to ( [ rewrite1 ] ) .",
    "indeed , for @xmath43 or @xmath44 , ( [ locus ] ) agrees with ( [ rewrite1 ] ) by tuning the khler parameters as follows , @xmath45 ( [ mass ] ) means that we set the mass parameter @xmath46 to zero . the partition function",
    "( [ rewrite1 ] ) in @xmath43 or @xmath44 means that we take the contribution of the strings which are stretched along the lower framing ( fig .",
    "[ string ] ( a ) ) or the upper framing ( fig .",
    "[ string ] ( b ) ) .",
    "thus , we can expect the enhancement of supersymmetry which is different from the one in the previous section .",
    "however , we could not obtain the elliptic genus which agreed with the partition function of m - strings perfectly .",
    "this result about the elliptic genus depends on taking some poles .",
    "therefore , we would like to consider this problem as a future work .",
    "i would like to thank satoshi yamaguchi for several discussion and check the manuscript .",
    "i would also like to thank to hironori mori for some comments and discussion .",
    "the theta function , the refined topological vertex , and its gluing factor are defined as follows :    * the theta function and its property @xmath47 * the refined topological vertex @xmath48 * the gluing factors @xmath49    we can use some formulas to calculate the partition function and the recursion formula that we will explain in the next subsection :    * some formulas about schur polynomial @xmath50 * normalization @xmath51 * some factor calculation @xmath52",
    "in this section , we calculate the building block about two cases , and we derive the recursion formula . then",
    ", we discuss how to connect two building blocks under the flop transition .",
    "+ then , we can write the partition function for the web diagram ( a ) , @xmath54 in order to calculate this , we consider the following equation , @xmath55 we can use the formula in the reference @xcite .",
    "then we obtain @xmath56 where we define @xmath57 .",
    "next we calculate the partition function for the web diagram ( b ) .",
    "this calculation is the same as the partition function @xmath58 .",
    "then we obtain @xmath59 and @xmath60 these results agree with each other under the flop transition ( see fig . [ building2 ] ) .",
    "the khler parameters are related as follows , @xmath61          we have already written the partition function for the web diagram ( c ) in section 3 . in order to calculate this , we consider the following equation , @xmath62 we calculate ( [ definition of f ] ) by using some formulas in appendix a. then we obtain      thus , we get @xmath64 in order to consider the non - zero value for @xmath65 , we set the representation of some schur functions to trivial . in order to do this , we restrict ( [ definition of f ] ) to @xmath66 then we obtain . ]",
    "@xmath67 therefore , we conclude @xmath68    next we calculate the partition function for the web diagram ( d ) . this partition function has been calculated in the reference @xcite .",
