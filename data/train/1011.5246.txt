    "binary supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) have long been proposed theoretically ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "galaxy mergers frequently occur and it is now widely appreciated that most bulge - dominated merging galaxies harbor central smbhs .",
    "thus the formation of binary smbhs from galaxy mergers seems inevitable .",
    "major mergers between two gas - rich galaxies of comparable mass also provide a viable means to channel a large amount of gas into the central region to trigger starbursts and quasar activity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , observationally confirmed binary smbhs are surprisingly scarce . about @xmath9 of quasars",
    "are in physical pairs with projected separations of tens to hundreds of kpc @xcite , and only a handful of confirmed binaries with projected separations on kpc scales are known in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on pc scales",
    ", there is only one confirmed binary smbh separated by @xmath10pc in projection @xcite , detected with the very long baseline array ( vlba ) .",
    "there are essentially no confirmed sub - pc binaries , although several candidates have been proposed , such as oj287 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and sdssj1536 + 0441 @xcite , for both of which alternative , _ non - binary _ interpretations exist .",
    "the frequency of observed smbh binaries is thus far below the expectations from the observed ( and simulation - predicted ) galaxy merger rate , and is in tension with the hypothesis that quasar activity is triggered by major mergers .",
    "if mergers do produce binary smbhs , then the most natural explanation for the apparent deficit of smbh binaries is that only a tiny fraction of them are detectable ; both bhs must be active for a detection and either their spatial separations must be resolvable , or orbital motion can be unambiguously inferred .",
    "so far the searches for binary agns / quasars with separations below several kpc are highly incomplete due to the stringent spatial resolution requirement .",
    "if quasar activity only occurs at the late stage of a merger ( as simulations suggest ) , then most binaries will be difficult to detect .",
    "a further complication is that at relatively low agn luminosity ( i.e. , @xmath11 ) , mergers may not be necessary to trigger bh activity , and alternative fueling routes ( secular processes ) may suffice .",
    "simulations predict that the effects of mergers on bh accretion start to become important at late stages when a pair of bhs is separated by a few kpc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; this is a scale of which one can still resolve the two nuclei with current instruments .",
    "it is therefore important to quantify the fraction of kpc - scale binary agns .",
    "this fraction will shed light on the agn triggering mechanism , and individual binaries will provide ideal test beds to understand the interplay between agns and hosts in these merging systems .",
    "the most efficient and systematic way to find these kpc - scale binary agns is an imaging survey conducted in the optical / nir with sub - arcsec resolution ( to find kpc separation pairs ) and the ability to identify agns .",
    "the seeing in imaging data from the sdss @xcite is only @xmath12 , but sdss does recover some very low - redshift kpc - scale binary agns ( liu et al .",
    "2010c , in preparation ) , where the two agns are separated by more than a few arcsec and were observed spectroscopically with separate fibers . at higher redshift ,",
    "such kpc - scale binary agns will fall within the 3  fiber and spatial information within the fiber is completely lost .",
    "a different approach is to select candidates with spectroscopic features that may hint at a binary and follow them up to confirm their binary agn nature . @xcite and @xcite revived the idea of selecting candidate kpc - scale binary agns based on double - peaked [ oiii ]  lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the hope is that the two velocity components of the [ oiii ]  line originate from two distinct narrow line regions ( nlrs ) , each associated with its own bh .",
    "these authors found that in two objects at @xmath13 the two [ oiii ]  components were spatially offset by a few kpc in their slit spectra , and claimed them to be kpc - scale binary agns .",
    "a third candidate was reported by @xcite based on spatially offset [ oiii]emission in a slit spectrum and a pair of resolved double nuclei in _ hst _ imaging ( but see * ? ? ? * for an alternative interperation for this system ) .",
    "several independent searches for agns with double - peaked [ oiii]lines have since been conducted using the sdss spectroscopic database : ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) and @xcite selected such objects from type 2 agns , while @xcite used a sample of type 1 agns ( mixed with some type 2 objects due to sdss pipeline misclassification ) .",
    "more than 200 double - peaked [ oiii ]  agns were identified ( based on visual inspection of sdss spectra ) with a median redshift @xmath14 , amounting to about @xmath0 of the total agn population .",
    "with very few exceptions , these objects do not appear to have double nuclei in their optical sdss images ( e.g. , paper i ; * ? ? ? * ) ; and of course the sdss fiber spectra do not indicate if the two velocity components are spatially offset by a few kpc .",
    "the bulk properties of the double - peaked agns are not dramatically different from those of the normal agn population ( paper i ) .",
    "not all of these double - peaked [ oiii ]  objects are kpc - scale binary agns .",
    "spatially resolved studies of nearby seyferts frequently show a quite dynamic picture of the nlr , involving outflows , inflows , rotation , and interactions with a radio jet .",
    "indeed , double - peaked [ oiii ]  features were already seen in early nlr studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one famous example is mrk 78 , which has a bipolar outflowing nlr structure , broadly aligned with the linear radio jet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; its spatially integrated spectrum shows a clear double - peaked [ oiii ]  line profile ( see fig . 1 of",
    "spatially resolved studies with _ hst _ have revealed more such cases ( such as ngc 1068 and ngc 4151 , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the nlr is dominated by outflows and/or rotation . for these dynamic nlrs , double - peaked features will naturally arise in spatially - integrated spectra when viewed at proper angles .",
    "moreover , these outflows or rotating gaseous disks can extend as far as a few kpc . thus detecting two [ oiii ]  peaks offset by a few kpc in slit spectra alone",
    "is _ not sufficient _ to conclude that the object is a kpc - scale binary agn .",
    "all these complications simply reflect the diverse nature of nlr gas dynamics , and follow - up observations are needed to identify bona fide kpc - scale binary agns from the double - peaked [ oiii]sample .    to that end , we have been conducting follow - up observations of our double - peaked [ oiii ]  sample ( paper i ) with ground - based nir imaging and slit spectroscopy .",
    "the nir imaging offers spatial resolution @xmath15  ( much better than the typical @xmath12  seeing for optical sdss imaging ) , and probes the old stellar populations ( mostly stars in the bulge ) . unlike the nlr gas , the stellar populations are unlikely to be involved in outflows , thus are a much less ambiguous indicator of the binary nature than using the nlr gas as a tracer .",
    "slit spectroscopy probes the spatial distribution of nlr gas emission , giving the spatial information unavailable in the sdss fiber spectra . once a pair of nuclei are resolved in the nir imaging , slit spectroscopy",
    "is required to associate the two [ oiii ]  peaks with each of the two nuclei .",
    "if , as is the case for mrk 78 , the nir image shows a smooth stellar distribution while the optical spectrum shows two spatially offset [ oiii]peaks without nir counterparts , then the double - peaked feature seen in the spatially integrated spectrum is more likely due to the kinematics of the nlr of a single agn .",
    "our imaging and spectroscopy follow - up observations have led to the discovery of several candidate binaries @xcite . in these objects ,",
    "we see spatially resolved double nuclei in the nir images , whose locations are coincident with the two [ oiii]components in the slit spectra .",
    "the two [ oiii ]  components have a relative velocity offset of a few hundred @xmath16 , which leads to the double - peaked profile in the sdss spectrum .",
    "the two components in each case have emission line flux ratios that place them in the agn region of the bpt diagram @xcite .",
    "these cases strongly suggest that they are binary agns at @xmath17 kpc ( projected ) separations , which are co - rotating along with their stellar bulges and are ionizing their individual nlrs in a merging pair of galaxies .",
    "recently , the interest of these double - peaked [ oiii ]  objects has led to two nir imaging studies with ground - based adaptive optics ( ao ) systems @xcite . with diffraction - limited resolution ( @xmath18 ) , these studies were able to resolve even closer double nucleus in the nir than our imaging data under natural seeing .",
    "however , optical spectroscopy is still needed to register the resolved double nucleus with the [ oiii ]  emission in order to confirm the binary agn nature , which becomes challenging on these smallest scales from the ground .",
    "in this paper we present a summary of our imaging and spectroscopy follow - up for 31 objects in our parent sample of double - peaked [ oiii ]  type 2 agns presented in paper i. the details of the parent sample ( 167 objects ) can be found in that paper . here",
    "we briefly describe the construction of this sample .",
    "we started from a sample of @xmath19 type 2 agns mostly from the mpa - jhu sdss dr7 galaxy sample with the following criteria : ( 1 ) the rest - frame wavelength ranges [ 4700 , 5100]  and [ 4982 , 5035]  centered on the [ oiii]@xmath205007  line have median signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) @xmath21 pixel@xmath22 and bad pixel fraction @xmath23 ; ( 2 ) the [ oiii]@xmath205007  line is detected at @xmath24 and has a rest - frame equivalent width ( ew ) @xmath25 ; 3 ) the line flux ratio [ oiii]@xmath205007/h@xmath26@xmath27 if @xmath28 , or the diagnostic line ratios [ oiii]@xmath205007/h@xmath26and [ nii]@xmath206584/h@xmath29  lie above the theoretical upper limits for star - formation excitation from kewley et al .",
    "( 2001 ) on the bpt diagram ( baldwin et al .  1981 ) if @xmath30 .",
    "all agns were then visually inspected and those with well - detected double peaks in both [ oiii]@xmath204959  and [ oiii]@xmath205007  with similar profiles were included in our final sample .",
    "we did not include those with complex line profiles such as lumpy , winged , or multi - component features .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "we describe our observations and data reduction in  [ sec : data ] , followed by discussions of individual objects in  [ sec : inter ] , where we categorize objects into binaries (  [ sec : binary ] ) , nlr kinematics around single agns (  [ sec : kinematics ] ) , and ambiguous cases (  [ sec : amb ] ) .",
    "we discuss the frequency of kpc - scale binary agns in  [ sec : dist ] , and conclude in  [ sec : con ] . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt a flat @xmath31cdm cosmology with @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "we obtained @xmath35-band ( or @xmath36-band if @xmath35 is unavailable ) images for @xmath37 objects in our double - peaked sample during six nights in two observing runs using the persson s auxiliary nasmyth infrared camera ( panic ; * ? ? ?",

    "however , our current sample of kpc - scale binary agns is still small , and a larger statistical sample of binary agns is needed to confirm these trends .    in these binary systems , the smaller stellar component does not necessarily correspond to the more luminous [ oiii ]  component .",
    "if bh mass is proportional to bulge mass / luminosity and [ oiii]luminosity is proportional to the intrinsic agn luminosity , then the smaller bh must be accreting at a substantially higher eddington ratio than the larger bh in j1131@xmath460204 and j1332 + 0606 .",
    "it is likely that the smaller component in these merging systems is more gas - rich and/or easier for the nuclear region to be disturbed during the merger , and hence the bh accretion is more efficient .",
    "although we have only followed up a small fraction of the double peaked [ oiii ]  type 2 agns in our sample ( paper i ) , the @xmath127 objects with both nir imaging and slit spectroscopic data presented in this paper allow us to estimate the fraction of kpc - scale agns among these double - peaked [ oiii ]  agns . for most of our targets we carried out the imaging first , and promising targets seen in the imaging data",
    "were preferentially observed spectroscopically .",
    "we have obtained slit spectra for only about half of the imaged objects .",
    "therefore we must estimate the fraction of binary agns and nlr kinematics taking into account the spectroscopic completeness .",
    "of the @xmath37 objects that we have observed in the nir , five were classified as kpc - scale binary agns with resolved double nuclei that are within the @xmath128  diameter of sdss fibers  velocity components seen in sdss spectra . ] , and subsequently confirmed with slit spectroscopy .",
    "hence the frequency of kpc - scale binary agns among these double - peaked [ oiii ]  objects is @xmath67 . of the remaining @xmath99 of the objects , @xmath4 are best explained by nlr kinematics (  [ sec : kinematics ] ) and @xmath129 are ambiguous cases .",
    "at least some of the latter case are of nlr kinematics origin , and the remainder are probably binary agns with somewhat smaller separations , and could be identified with better spatial resolution observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if we take the results of @xcite and assume all the objects with resolved double nuclei in their nir ao imaging are binary agns ( but see  [ sec : dis2 ] ) , then the binary agn fraction among the double - peaked [ oiii ]  objects increases to @xmath130 .",
    "it is conceivable ( although unlikely ) that kpc - scale binary agns with even smaller separations would not have been revealed with nir ao imaging , and if we assume this entire ambiguous sample is binaries , we get a hard upper limit of the kpc - scale binary agn fraction of @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , a conservative estimate of the genuine kpc - binary agn fraction of the double - peaked [ oiii]type 2 agns is @xmath131 and the upper bound should be considered as a hard limit .",
    "our observations thus indicate that the majority of these double - peaked [ oiii ]  objects reflect nlr kinematics and are not kpc - scale binary agns . however , in some of the systems that we classified as kinematic cases , we see disturbed morphology or close companions , which may indicate that the ( single ) agn activity was triggered by a recent merger event .",
    "only @xmath132 of low - redshift ( @xmath133 ) type 2 agns have double - peaked [ oiii ]  profiles in their spatially - integrated spectra ( paper i ) .",
    "if the orbit inclination is random for binary agns , then some of them will not show a double - peaked [ oiii ]  profile since the line itself has a finite width ( due to the intrinsic line width and instrument broadening ) , and thus will not enter our sample .",
    "the real situation is more complicated .",
    "the selection completeness depends on the spectral resolution of sdss , and the intrinsic distributions of binary properties , such as the relative velocity of the two bhs at @xmath41 kpc separations , and the fwhm and strength of individual narrow line components .",
    "the sdss spectral resolution will exclude double - peaked [ oiii ]  objects with a relative velocity offset @xmath134 , and our sample in paper i is strongly biased against weak [ oiii ]  objects . in paper",
    "i we performed simple monte carlo simulations of mock spectra to estimate the selection completeness of kpc binaries with double - peaked [ oiii ]  with assumed distributions of kpc - scale binary agn properties , combined with the sdss spectral resolution and random line - of - sight ( los ) .",
    "we found that the selection completeness rapidly decreases with decreasing the los velocity offset , decreasing the [ oiii]equivalent width , and increasing the line fwhm ; and all these effects are well coupled .",
    "here we perform similar monte carlo simulations , with reasonable properties that are appropriate for our sample .",
    "we assume a physical relative velocity offset of @xmath135 between the two velocity components ( i.e. , both nlrs are on circular orbits with circular velocities of @xmath136 ) , a fixed fwhm@xmath137 for both components , and assign an [ oiii]@xmath205007  rest equivalent width ew@xmath1385007}\\equiv 3$]ew@xmath1384959}$ ] uniformly distributed within @xmath139  for each component .",
    "the assumed circular velocity of the binary is reasonable given that our objects are massive galaxies with stellar mass @xmath140 , and the adopted fwhm and ew values are also typical of our sample objects ( paper i ) .",
    "we further assume random orientations of the binary orbits , and generate mock spectra with the assumed [ oiii ]  properties , a continuum s / n@xmath102pixel@xmath22 , and the sdss spectral resolution .",
    "we visually inspect these mock spectra and flag double - peaked objects .",
    "we found * @xmath130 * of the simulated objects are identified as double - peaked [ oiii ]  objects .",
    "as discussed earlier , 10 - 50% of double - peaked objects have compelling evidence for two active nuclei ( @xmath141 ) . now assuming that we can detect only @xmath142 of true double - peaked objects",
    ", we expect that @xmath143 of the @xmath1 type 2 agn population is double , and thus that a fraction @xmath144 of the total population is composed of kpc - scale binaries .",
    "it is very likely that there are populations of kpc - scale binary agns with a relative ( unreduced ) orbital velocity @xmath145 or with more discrepant [ oiii ]  luminosity ratios that are missed in our sdss sample .    at face value",
    ", this low fraction of kpc - scale binary agns is at odds with the hypothesis that agns are triggered by major mergers .",
    "it either implies that the fraction of time that a binary agn spends during this kpc phase is very small compared to the total agn lifetime , or only a tiny fraction of kpc - scale binary agns have two distinct nlrs with comparable luminosity and are lit up simultaneously .",
    "alternatively , it could be that major mergers are not the dominant mechanism for triggering low - luminosity agn activity at low redshift , since the fueling rate is not as stringent for agns as for luminous quasars , and alternative fueling routes ( i.e. , secular processes and minor mergers ) may suffice .",
    "refining the binary agn fraction at various separations and combining with numerical simulation results are needed to sort out these possibilities , and our current study represents the first step towards quantifying the demographics of binary agns on kpc scales .",
    "our nir imaging and optical slit spectroscopy demonstrate the importance of combining imaging and spectroscopy data in confirming the binary agn nature of double - peaked objects .",
    "objects that show spatially offset [ oiii ]  emission in slit spectra are not necessarily kpc - scale binary agns , as seen in most of the cases ascribed to nlr kinematics discussed in  [ sec : kinematics ] .",
    "likewise , objects that show apparent double nuclei in the nir imaging are not necessarily kpc - scale binary agns , as the companion may not have [ oiii ]  emission at all .",
    "objects such as j0002@xmath450045 presented in this paper clearly demonstrate the latter case . for the same reason ,",
    "not all of the objects with resolved multiple nuclei in @xcite are binary agns , even if these multiple nuclei are covered in a single sdss fiber .",
    "for example , j1157@xmath450816 shows three components in both optical and nir imaging @xcite .",
    "however , neither the upper or lower companions in the slit spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1157 + 0816 ] ) show [ oiii ]  emission ( although both are at the redshift of the central object ) , and the double - peaked [ oiii ]  emission is likely caused by the nlr kinematics of the central source .",
    "we have presented nir imaging and optical slit spectroscopic data for 31 double - peaked [ oiii ]  type 2 agns drawn from the sample of paper i. the combination of imaging and spectroscopy allows us to identify the origin of the double - peaked [ oiii]emission in these peculiar objects .",

    "* we estimate that @xmath6 of the local ( @xmath133 ) type 2 agns are kpc - scale binary agns in a major merger , where both components are obscured type 2 agn with comparable [ oiii ]  luminosities .",

    "<S> approximately @xmath0 of low redshift ( @xmath1 ) optically - selected type 2 active galactic nuclei ( agns ) show a double - peaked [ oiii ]  narrow emission line profile in their spatially - integrated spectra . </S>",
    "<S> such features are usually interpreted as due either to kinematics , such as biconical outflows and/or disk rotation of the narrow line region ( nlr ) around single black holes , or to the relative motion of two distinct nlrs in a merging pair of agns . here </S>",
    "<S> we report follow - up near infrared ( nir ) imaging and optical slit spectroscopy of @xmath2 double - peaked [ oiii ]  type 2 agns drawn from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) parent sample presented in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the nir imaging traces the old stellar population in each galaxy , while the optical slit spectroscopy traces the nlr gas . </S>",
    "<S> these data reveal a mixture of origins for the double - peaked feature . </S>",
    "<S> roughly @xmath3 of our objects are best explained by binary agns at ( projected ) kpc - scale separations , where two stellar components with spatially coincident nlrs are seen . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4 of our objects have [ oiii ]  emission offset by a few kpc , corresponding to the two velocity components seen in the sdss spectra , but there are no corresponding double stellar components seen in the nir imaging . for those objects with sufficiently high quality slit spectra , </S>",
    "<S> we see velocity and/or velocity dispersion gradients in [ oiii ]  emission , suggestive of the kinematic signatures of a single nlr . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining @xmath5 of our objects are ambiguous , and will need higher spatial resolution observations to distinguish between the two scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> our observations therefore favor the kinematics scenario with a single agn for the majority of these double - peaked [ oiii ]  type 2 agns . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize the importance of combining imaging and slit spectroscopy in identifying kpc - scale binary agns , i.e. , in no cases does one of these alone allow an unambiguous identification . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate that @xmath6 of the @xmath7 type 2 agns are kpc - scale binary agns of comparable luminosities , with a relative orbital velocity @xmath8 . </S>",
