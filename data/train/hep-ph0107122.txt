    "the theoretical development of a composite photon theory ( based on de broglie s idea that the photon is composed of a neutrino - antineutrino pair  @xcite bound by some interaction ) has had a stormy history with many negative papers . while de broglie did not address the problem of statistics for the composite photon , `` jordan considered the essential part of the problem was to construct bose - einstein amplitudes from fermi - dirac amplitudes . '' furthermore , `` he suggested that it is not the interaction between neutrinos and antineutrinos that binds them together into photons , but rather the manner in which they interact with charged particles that leads to the simplified description of light in terms of photons . ''",
    "jordan s hypothesis  @xcite traded one problem for another .",
    "although he eliminated the need for theorizing an unknown interaction , his hypothesis that the neutrino and antineutrino are emitted in exactly the same direction seems rather artificial and was criticized by fock  @xcite .",
    "his strong desire to obtain exact bose commutation relations for the composite photon led him to work with a scalar or longitudinally polarized photon . indeed , starting with jordan s @xmath0 , @xmath1 barbour _ et .",
    "@xcite showed that the resulting photon would be longitudinally polarized instead of transversely polarized like real photons .",
    "if jordan had worked with a transversely polarized photon , he could not have obtained bose commutation relations .",
    "more recently , researchers  @xcite have been satisfied that composite particles formed of fermion pairs ( quasi - bosons ) such as the deuteron and cooper pairs are only approximate bosons as they do not quite satisfy bose commutation relations .",
    "quasi - bosons obey the commutation relations of the form , @xmath2 = 0 ,   \\nonumber \\\\",

    "\\label{eqnquasi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these are identical to bose commutation relations except for the additional @xmath3 term ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , whose value is very small .",
    "thus , it is easy to envisage that eq .",
    "( [ eqnquasi ] ) is a more accurate form of the commutation relations for integral spin particles .",
    "as presented in many quantum mechanics texts it may appear that bose commutation relations follow from basic principles , but it is really from the classical canonical formalism .",
    "this is _ not _ a reliable procedure as evidenced by the fact that it gives the completely wrong result for spin 1/2 particles .",
    "furthermore , in extending the classical canonical formalism for the photon , it is necessary to deviate from the canonical rules ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , p.  98 ) .",
    "if jordan had taken the approach that the composite photon is only an approximate boson , pryce  @xcite could never have proven that the theory was impossible .",
    "jordan s hypothesis that a single neutrino or antineutrino can simulate a photon , which was needed to obtain bose statistics , is not in agreement with experiment . for",
    "otherwise , the interaction cross - section for neutrinos with matter would be orders of magnitude greater than the measured value .    from reading pryce",
    "s paper one might get the impression that creating transversely - polarized photons from neutrinos is a problem for the theory .",
    "the real problem ( as pryce does shows ) is in obtaining both bose statistics and transversely - polarized photons .",
    "it is interesting to note in retrospect that pryce s four postulates do not include the key assumption : _ the photon obeys bose commutation relations _ , which is essential to the theorem .",
    "this is not too surprising since jordan  @xcite and those working with him on the theory also took bose statistics as an absolute .",
    "berezinskii  @xcite in reaffirming pryce s theorem , does include bose statistics as one of his five assumptions .",
    "he argues that certain bose commutation relations are necessary for the photon to be truly neutral .",
    "however , perkins  @xcite has shown that a neutral photon in the usual sense can be obtained without bose commutation relations .",
    "pryce made the difficulties look much worse than they are by accepting jordan s solution to the statistics problem which sealed the impossibility of solving the polarization problem .",
    "case  @xcite and berezinskii  @xcite agree that constructing transversely polarized photons is not the problem .",
    "kronig  @xcite and perkins  @xcite have explicitly constructed transversely - polarized photons from neutrinos .    in a remarkable paper  @xcite kronig",
    "showed a second quantization method for obtaining the photon field from components of the neutrino and antineutrino fields .",
    "the photons thus obtained have transverse polarization and obey maxwell s equations .",
    "( pryce s criticisms do not apply to these calculations . ) in order to obtain the usual commutation relations for the electromagnetic field , he introduced a relation between the neutrino spinors a and c which is not invariant under rotations of the coordinate system . although pryce emphasized this error in kronig s paper , the results that kronig was trying to obtain follow directly from plane - wave spinors as shown by perkins  @xcite .",
    "although conventional photon theory has been very successful , it has some shortcomings . to satisfy lorentz invariance , it is necessary to introduce non - physical polarization states .",
    "the difficulty in conventional theory of quantizing the electromagnetic field has been noted  @xcite , `` it is ironic that of the fields we shall consider it is the most difficult to quantize . '' to avoid the problems of non - physical photons , veltman  @xcite quantized the field with a small photon mass .",
    "more serious are the divergent problems which require renormalization .",
    "a composite photon might help in solving some of these problems .",
    "two major problems facing the theory are : ( 1 ) understanding the neutrino - antineutrino interaction that `` binds '' them into a photon , and ( 2 ) showing that the non - bose photon ( which results from the theory ) is not in contradiction with any physical laws .",
    "this latter point is the subject of a recent paper  @xcite in which it is shown that the blackbody radiation spectrum for composite photons is so similar to planck s law that existing experiments could not have detected the difference .",
    "the commutation relations for the fields do not satisfy space - like commutativity , but this is true of many integral spin particles and just indicates that composite particles have a finite extent  @xcite .    according to the standard model",
    ", the neutrino is described by a two- component theory . to form a photon which satisfies parity and charge conjugation , we need both sets of two - component neutrinos , right - handed and left - handed neutrinos",
    ". two sets of neutrinos have been observed , one that couples with electrons and one that couples with muons .",
    "these can be our two sets of two - component neutrinos if the positive muon is identified as the particle and the negative muon as the antiparticle ( see sec .",

    "fermi and yang  @xcite have outlined a method of forming a composite pion from a nucleon - antinucleon pair .",
    "they imposed some special requirements on the interaction .",
    "the attraction should not be a new force field , for this would require the quanta of that new field to be elementary particles themselves .",
    "thus , only forces of zero range are compatible with relativistic invariance and the simplest relativistically invariant interactions between two fields are usual five types  @xcite .",
    "we want to use these interactions for the same reasons that fermi and yang suggested them and in addition because we know from our previous work  @xcite that they result in transversely - polarized photons .",
    "differing from fermi and yang , we will use two - component neutrinos instead of nucleons and work at the two - component level .",
    "we prefer to work at the two - component level as all terms are meaningful there , unlike the 4-component level where most of the terms are zero .",
    "the weyl equations for the two types of neutrinos are : @xmath4 where the @xmath5 s are the pauli 2x2 spin matrices .",
