    ", even small nonintegrable perturbations may render the phenomenology much richer , causing various inelastic effects , such as trapping and formation of bound states , multiple - bounce interactions ( where solitons separate after multiple collisions ) @xcite , fractality in the outcome of the collision @xcite , and others .",
    "such complex features are usually attributed to the excitation of soliton internal modes @xcite , but more recently it was realized that they also occur due to the possibility for radiationless energy exchange ( even in the absence of internal modes ) between the colliding solitons , should the conservation laws allow it @xcite .",
    "the latter mechanism was both confirmed by direct simulations of the corresponding nonintegrable models , and might be expected to ensue from the principle stating that any outcome compatible with the conservation laws may take place under appropriate initial conditions .",
    "such effects suggest that the integrability is essentially tantamount to the strictly elastic character of the collisions @xcite , and warrant the importance of further studies of strongly inelastic collision effects produced by small conservative perturbations added to basic integrable models .",
    "this general issue is of interest not only in its own right , but also for applications to nonlinear optical waveguides , as strong changes in the character of the interaction induced by a small perturbation may be naturally used in the context of switching , see e.g. , @xcite and references therein .",
    "the objective of the present work is to consider such effects in collisions of dynamical ( rather than topological ) solitons in a _",
    "discrete _ near - integrable system . as a matter of fact , the only integrable system which can be used in this case as the zeroth - order approximation is the ablowitz - ladik ( al ) lattice @xcite .",
    "its well - known nonintegrable extension is the salerno model ( sm ) @xcite , which is produced by adding the integrability - breaking perturbation in the form of the onsite nonlinearity to the integrable al system with the inter - site cubic nonlinearity . in order to test",

    ", the quintic onsite nonlinearity [ its principal difference from the cubic counterpart is that it breaks the integrability of both the al lattice and of its continuum limit , i.e. , the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation ] .",
    "thus , we introduce a general dynamical model based on the following equation : @xmath2 here @xmath3 is the complex dynamical variable at the @xmath4-th site of the lattice , the overdot stands for the time derivative , @xmath5 is the lattice spacing , @xmath6 is a real constant controlling the quintic perturbation , and @xmath7 is a real parameter that accounts for the crossover between the al ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) and discrete - nls ( @xmath10 , @xmath9 ) @xcite limits . equation ( [ sal1 ] ) conserves two dynamical invariants , namely , the norm , @xmath11 ,   \\label{no}\\ ] ] and energy ( hamiltonian ) , @xmath12 \\right .",

    "however , the results presented below clearly demonstrate that strong effects generated by small conservative perturbations are essentially the same for different perturbations , therefore we expect that taking into regard all the possible perturbation terms corresponding to the optical waveguides with strong overlap between the cores will not alter the results significantly .    in some specific cases , soliton collisions in the sm",
    "have already been examined . in particular ,",
    "a collision between a soliton and a reflecting wall , which is equivalent to a strictly symmetric collision between the soliton and its mirror image , were studied numerically in ref .",
    "one of our aims is to explore sensitivity of collisions to small asymmetries in initial phases and positions of the solitons in the actual two - soliton collision .",
    "very recently , collisions in the ( strongly nonintegrable ) discrete nls equation were examined @xcite , and symmetry - breaking effects were found , along with sensitivity of the outcome to the location of the collision point . here , we present results of collisions and their dependence on parameters in the model ( [ sal1 ] ) with small @xmath7 and @xmath6 , i.e. , close to the integrable al limit .",
    "together with the already available findings for the strongly nonintegrable case @xcite , they provide for a sufficiently comprehensive description of the collisional dynamics of nontopological solitons in fundamental lattice systems .",

    "it will be seen below that , as a matter of fact , the difference between the exact norm and hamiltonian of the full perturbed model with small @xmath7 and @xmath6 and those of the al model is negligible . however , all the other dynamical invariants of the al model , _ including _ the lattice momentum ( [ sal5 ] ) , have no counterparts in the nonintegrable case .",
    "this is explained by the fact that each elementary dynamical invariant is generated by a certain continuum invariance of the underlying equation . in particular , the norm and energy conservation are accounted for by the invariance against phase and time shifts , respectively , that remain valid in the nonintegrable system , while a hidden dynamical symmetry of the al model which is responsible for the conservation of the lattice momentum is destroyed by the small perturbations .",
    "the momentum remains a dynamical invariant in continuum nonintegrable models ( e.g. , the nls equation with the quintic term ) , but in the discrete setting it is conserved solely in the integrable case  obviously , a generic lattice system is not invariant against arbitrary spatial translations",
    ". further consideration of this issue can be found in a recent work @xcite .",
    "an issue related to the lack of conserved momentum is the ( non)existence of exact traveling soliton solutions in nonintegrable lattice models . while the problem still waits for its full solution ,",
    "several important theoretical results have been obtained .",
    "the inclusion of an appropriate traveling ansatz in the discrete equation gives rise to a differential - delay equation whose steady states are the traveling wave solutions of the original differential - difference equation ( see e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite , as well as an earlier work by feddersen , ref .",
    "it is also pertinent to mention that moving solitons clearly persist in simulations of perturbed systems , without any conspicuous loss , for long times , which is sufficient to study their collisions in numerical experiments without ambiguity ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "if the given system differs from the al model by small terms , a natural question is how strong actual destruction of the former dynamical invariants , and especially of the momentum , which has a straightforward physical interpretation ( and remains a virtually conserved quantity for free moving solitons , as explained above ) will be in collisions between solitons .",
    "one of main objectives of the present work is to address this issue .",
    "we will conclude that the momentum conservation is _ strongly _ violated by the collisions , even if the perturbation parameters are quite small .    for two",
    "broadly separated al solitons with parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 , the expressions ( [ sal4 ] )  ( [ sal6 ] ) take values @xmath32 @xmath33 the fact that only two exact and , plausibly , one approximate conserved quantities ( the latter one is the momentum ) constrain possible outcomes of the soliton - soliton collisions , which are characterized by two amplitudes , two velocities , and , in addition , may depend on the initial relative phase @xmath34 and positions @xmath35 and @xmath36 of the solitons , suggests that the above - mentioned radiationless energy exchange between the two solitons is quite feasible .",
    "furthermore , for slow solitons ( small @xmath31 ) the conservation of @xmath37 becomes an amplitude constraint [ see eqs .",
    "( [ sal3 ] ) ] , and if amplitudes are small too ( @xmath38 ) , @xmath37 reduces to @xmath39 , see eqs .",
    "( [ nq ] ) , so that there actually remains the single constraint in this limit case .",

    "the initial condition was taken as a superposition of two far separated solitons ( [ sal2 ] ) that would be exact solutions of the al model , and the numerical integration was run until outgoing solitons were separated well enough .",
    "their amplitudes and velocities after the collision , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , were measured , and then the corresponding parameters @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 were found inverting eqs .",

    "we will focus on the symmetric collisions : @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",

    "the initial positions of the solitons were taken as @xmath63 and @xmath64 , with @xmath65 ; this provides for the large initial separation @xmath66 between them , while @xmath67 was chosen from the interval @xmath68 to control the location of the collision point .",
    "the presentation of results is structured as follows : we first examine the effect of variation of the initial phase difference @xmath59 and collision point @xmath67 on the outcome of the collision .",
    "then , we analyze how the approximate conservation of the expressions ( [ nq ] ) and ( [ p ] ) correlates with the results .",
    "finally , we examine the effect of combining the perturbation parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 , in order to demonstrate that the two perturbations may almost exactly cancel each other , thus making the collisions virtually elastic . we stress",

    "similar compensation effects were observed for @xmath128 and @xmath129 in a wide range of soliton parameters , including non - symmetric collisions ( between non - identical solitons ) .",
