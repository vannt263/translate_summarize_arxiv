    "the lowest electronically excited states of alkali dimers for long have been of interest as gateway or `` window '' states for the excitation of higher singlet or triplet levels @xcite .",
    "quite recently , various low excited states of alkali dimers have also been used as intermediaries in the production of ultracold molecules , as for rbcs @xcite , lics @xcite , krb @xcite , nacs @xcite , rb@xmath4 @xcite and cs@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "although molecules with electric dipole moments have attracted the most interest , homonuclear species , such as cs@xmath4 , also offer the interesting conceptual challenge of non - spherically symmetric particles in a condensate @xcite .",
    "furthermore the cold atoms can be prepared with fewer lasers than required for dual species systems .",
    "cold cs@xmath4 molecules may also be useful in experiments designed to be sensitive to the electron : proton mass ratio , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "various new possibilities inherent in cold molecules have prompted efforts to obtain and analyze the spectra of alkali dimer molecules .",
    "the lowest excited states above the @xmath5 limit , namely the @xmath6 and @xmath7 states ( where the ungerade designation applies only to homonuclear species ) , would seem to be especially interesting in this regard .",
    "however , transitions from the ground state may require frequencies for which the availability of laser sources is limited .",
    "furthermore , spin - orbit perturbative interactions between the @xmath8 and @xmath9 state levels complicate the spectra . as a route to cold ground state molecules from weakly bound molecules that are formed on a feshbach resonance ( fr ) , the @xmath8 and @xmath9 states of homonuclear species",
    "do not have the special advantage of possible triplet to singlet transfer which is possible in heteronuclear species @xcite which have no _ gerade / ungerade _ selection rules . in view of these difficulties , it is noteworthy that , to date , only for cs@xmath4 have the @xmath8 and @xmath9 states been used as intermediates in the production of cold molecules @xcite .",
    "the spin - orbit perturbations are somewhat more severe in species containing rb or cs than in the @xmath8 and @xmath9 states of other alkali dimers .",
    "nevertheless , with cs@xmath4 , refs .",
    "@xcite used the @xmath10 component of a weakly bound molecule formed on a fr to excite to the @xmath0 component of an upper state level .",
    "two two - photon steps were used to efficiently connect the fr molecular state , via @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "recently , the methods available for analyzing and modeling spectroscopic data on highly perturbed states have been extended @xcite as is evident from the discussion below , each effort to perform a `` global analysis '' of all available data on these two electronic states raises additional questions about what hamiltonian elements and functions are required , and what data is required to determine the parameters so as to achieve a fit with residuals comparable to experimental uncertainties",
    ". there has been impresssive progress in data acquisition and analysis for the heteronuclear @xmath8 and @xmath9 states from work on nak @xcite to more recent work on narb @xcite , nacs @xcite , kcs @xcite , and rbcs @xcite . for narb , nacs , and kcs , vibrational assignments of both states have been reliably determined , and the perturbative interactions have been modeled to an accuracy of 0.01 @xmath13 or better .",
    "higher - order spin - orbit effects were included in @xcite and in @xcite , and there was quite good agreement between empirically extracted and _ ab initio _ potentials .",
    "curiously , for one alkali dimer recently used for cold molecule work , namely krb @xcite , spectroscopic data on low levels of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 states appear to be lacking , and optical state transfer processes leading to cold krb molecules have used other pathways .",
    "there have also been a succession of studies of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 states of the lighter homonuclear alkali dimer species li@xmath4 @xcite , na@xmath4 @xcite , k@xmath4 @xcite and rb@xmath4 @xcite . for na@xmath4 @xcite , data now extend almost continuously from the lowest vibrational levels to the atomic limit .",
    "one question that arises when considering this summary of spectroscopic data on the @xmath8 and @xmath9 states of cs@xmath4 is why hyperfine structure ( hfs ) is not reported .",
    "earlier work @xcite on the @xmath8 and @xmath9 states of na@xmath4 , using a molecular beam , and accessing levels with significant @xmath16 character , showed hfs structure spanning several hundred mhz .",
    "the atomic hfs interaction of @xmath17cs is larger than that of @xmath18na .",
    "two of the techniques in the present work , namely optical - optical double resonance polarization spectroscopy , and spectroscopy with cold ground state cs@xmath4 molecules , have very small inherent linewidths .",
    "nevertheless , the transitions observed here are not expected to exhibit hyperfine structure , as we discuss in section vi below .",
    "this paper presents a detailed model of the energy level structure of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 states of cs@xmath4 . in section",
    "ii , we describe experimental techniques used to obtain high resolution spectra .",
    "section iii describes the model used to fit the data .",
    "section iv discusses presents _ ab initio _",
    "results for potentials and spin - orbit functions , calculated from two different approaches .",
    "section v discusses radiative properties of the @xmath19 complex , including certain anomalies occurring for mixed singlet - triplet upper states .",
    "section vi discusses the possibilities for observing hyperfine structure , while section vii gives a short summary and conclusion .",
    "this report combines experimental data from several sources .",
    "a substantial part comes from fourier transform spectroscopy ( fts ) performed in the laboratoire aime cotton ( lac ) , orsay , france , in connection with the study of the cs@xmath4 @xmath10 ground state as presented in @xcite .",
    "more recently , fts data has been obtained at the university of latvia in riga .",
    "additional high resolution data were obtained in tsinghua university , beijing , using fluorescence excitation spectroscopy .",
    "another valuable component of the data consists of fluorescence lines from the @xmath20 state @xcite , observed at tsinghua university , which provided information on the lowest vibrational levels of the @xmath21 state , of both parities , @xmath22 .",
    "an ultra - high resolution data set , limited in absolute accuracy by wavelength meter calibration , was obtained by excitation of cold cs@xmath4 molecules at the university of innsbruck , covering a limited range of energies . finally , because of a substantial gap in the above data on higher @xmath23 levels , the lyyra and huennekens groups , working at temple university , employed optical - optical double resonance ( oodr ) polarization spectroscopy , with collisional orientation transfer as in @xcite , to partially fill in this gap . unlike the other data sets ,",
    "the work at temple has not been published previously and therefore the discussion is more detailed .      many of the term values used in the present work are the upper state levels from transitions observed in lac and reported in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "cs atoms in a heat pipe oven at 600k were excited , in the 1987 study by an argon - ion laser , and in the 2002 work by a titanium - doped sapphire ( ti : sa ) laser , pumped by an argon - ion laser .",
    "the fluorescence in the backward direction was collected and sent into a fourier spectrometer with a 2 m optical path length difference .",
    "wave numbers were calibrated by reference to a xenon atomic transition near 3.5 @xmath24 m , with absolute uncertainties between 0.001 and 0.003 @xmath13 . for @xcite ,",
    "16,900 transitions were measured from 113 main fluorescence series and 348 series including rotational relaxation .",
    "the data are no longer available on the lac website , but are posted in the epaps file associated with this article @xcite .    at the university of latvia ,",
    "fts data on the @xmath8 and @xmath9 states of cs@xmath4 have been obtained recently in the process of analyzing the @xmath25 laser - induced fluorescence ( lif ) spectra of kcs @xcite and rbcs @xcite molecules . in these spectra , along with transitions in kcs and rbcs , the @xmath25 lif spectra of cs@xmath26 molecules were present as well . in the experiments ,",
    "the molecules were produced in a linear heat - pipe at about 565k temperature and excited by diode lasers centered at 980 nm , 1020 nm and 1050 nm .",
    "the backward lif spectra have been recorded by fourier transform spectrometer ifs-125hr with 0.03 @xmath13 resolution .",
    "the transition frequencies obtained , with ca .",
    "0.003 - 0.004 @xmath13 accuracy , have been added to the @xmath27 state term values of cs@xmath26 calculated with the @xmath27 state potential of @xcite , corrected by @xcite .",
    "the estimated overall uncertainty of term values , accounting for doppler broadening , is about 0.01 @xmath13 .",
    "the relative lif intensity distributions have been determined in sufficiently lengthy progressions , accounting for the spectral sensitivity of the ingaas detector as described in ref .",
    "for comparison with theory , the intensities were averaged over @xmath28 doublet components and corrected for the spectral sensitivity of the detector .",
    "this approach , employed at tsinghua university , involved two - photon excitation to a higher state ( @xmath29 or @xmath30 ) from levels of the @xmath10 state via levels of the @xmath0 state , which was monitored by observing decay ( direct , or collision - induced ) to the @xmath31 state .",
    "after the double resonance signal was found and optimized , the same @xmath32 [ or @xmath33",
    "$ ] or @xmath34 [ or @xmath35 upper level was excited from @xmath36 or @xmath37 intermediate levels .",
    "thus the term values of the @xmath36 or @xmath37 levels can be obtained by adding the term values of the @xmath38 , or @xmath39 ) or @xmath40 , or @xmath41 ) ground levels @xcite to the pump laser frequency with an accuracy of @xmath420.003 @xmath13 .      as part of the effort at the university of innsbruck to produce ultracold cs@xmath4 molecules in the rovibronic ground state near quantum degeneracy @xcite , weakly bound molecules were formed by association of atoms on a feshbach resonance in a high phase - space density sample .",
    "subsequently , two stirap transitions were used to transfer the population to @xmath43 .",
    "a first pair of lasers linked the feshbach level to the intermediate level , @xmath44 or @xmath45 , via an @xmath23 excited state level near 12,500 @xmath13 .",
    "unfortunately , in the present study there were insufficient data points near the levels around 12,500 @xmath13 , so these term values could not be accurately fit in our analysis .",
    "the second two - photon transition starting from the @xmath46 level involved an @xmath23 intermediate level near 10,000 @xmath13 .",
    "spectroscopy on the first transition , as described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , was carried out by irradiating the feshbach molecules for a given time with light near 1126 nm , stepping the laser frequency with each cycle of the experiment .",
    "for spectroscopy near 10,000 @xmath13 , molecules were first coherently transferred by stirap to @xmath47 , and then irradiated with light near 1350 nm , as described in ref .",
    "for detection , the molecules were transferred back to the original weakly bound state , dissociated , and the resulting atoms were imaged by absorption imaging .",
    "for stirap , the lasers were stabilized to reach both a short - term linewidth and long - term stability on the khz level by locking to optical resonators and additional referencing to a stabilized optical frequency comb .",
    "however , wavemeter calibration was estimated to be 0.01 @xmath13 , presenting a limitation on the absolute frequency accuracy of these transitions .",
    "ultimately , the radiative linewidth of perhaps 1 mhz would limit the resolution .",
    "approximately 14 @xmath23 levels excited from @xmath27 state levels near @xmath48=73 are included in the data set analyzed in the present work .",
    "these term values are listed in table 1 of @xcite in connection with an earlier version of the present analysis .",
    "these data were obtained at tsinghua university , and are taken from ref .",
    "two successive diode lasers , each of 5 mhz linewidth , were used to excite @xmath49 and @xmath50 transitions .",
    "fluorescence from @xmath51 was dispersed with a 0.85 m double grating spex 1404 monochromator .",
    "the accuracy of the fluorescence lines was estimated to be about 1.5 @xmath13 , with some better and others worse .",
    "v - type optical - optical double - resonance ( oodr ) polarization spectroscopy was performed at temple university to obtain data on mixed @xmath23 levels in a region of energy not studied previously . among different types of polarization spectroscopy @xcite ,",
    "this technique is well suited to observe selected transitions in the congested spectra of cs@xmath4 since in the single - laser based sub - doppler experiments , the assignment of spectral lines is not trivial .",
    "furthermore , collisional transfer of orientation produces a series of well - separated spectral lines associated with nearby levels that have been oriented and polarized .",
    "another possible approach might be optical triple resonance , as used for li@xmath4 @xcite , na@xmath4 @xcite , and k@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this approach would overcome the unfavorable franck - condon factors mentioned below , but would not yield the range of @xmath52 values obtained in the present work , since optimization of signal to noise through cooling of the sample molecules would probably be necessary .",
    "as in previous implementations of this technique ( see @xcite and @xcite and references therein ) , a circularly polarized pump laser beam , tuned to a chosen transition , creates an anisotropic distribution of magnetic sublevel populations ( net orientation ) in one or more ground state rovibrational levels .",
    "the counterpropagating linearly polarized probe laser beam can be considered to be made up of equal parts left and right circular polarization . when the probe frequency is tuned to a transition sharing either level with the pump transition , the orientation created by the pump causes the two circularly polarized probe components to experience different absorption coefficients ( circular dichroism ) and different indices of refraction ( circular birefringence ) . consequently , when the probe beam exits the oven , the two components no longer sum to the initial linear polarization , but rather the beam has a slight elliptical polarization and some fraction of it is transmitted through a final crossed linear polarizer before reaching the detector .",
    "figure [ exp1 ] shows schematically the transitions in this technique .",
    "more information on the @xmath53 state is available from the potentials shown in fig .",
    "[ epots ] .",
    "a representation of the apparatus is shown in @xcite .",
    "the experimental setup used here was similar to the one used previously for rb@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "collisional lines help to expand the data field but can only be observed if orientation is transferred from the ground state level labeled by the pump laser to a neighboring level . a quantitative study of the transfer of population and orientation in collisions of nak molecules with argon and potassium atoms has been carried out and reported in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "the cs@xmath4 metal was loaded at the center of a five - arm heat pipe oven , which was kept at a temperature of 550 k , with 3 torr argon buffer gas . a cr-699 - 29 tunable single mode laser with kiton",
    "red 620 dye was used as the circularly polarized pump laser , tuned to known @xcite cs@xmath4 @xmath54 transitions .",
    "a cr-899 - 29 ti - sapphire single mode laser served as the linearly polarized probe laser .",
    "the two lasers were counter - propagating and overlapped in the center of the heatpipe with a crossing angle that was minimized so as to maximize the overlap area .",
    "the power of the pump ( probe ) laser was 100mw ( 20mw ) in front of the heatpipe .",
    "the spot sizes ( defined as a radius at @xmath55 intensity ) of the pump ( 1.2 mm ) and probe ( 0.9 mm ) laser beams in the interaction region were measured with a razor blade technique @xcite .",

    "@xcite were used to make the pump beam circularly polarized .",
    "two linear polarizers in the probe laser beam path ( one before and one after the heat pipe oven ) had relative transmission axes at a 90 degree angle for maximum extinction of the probe laser when it was off resonance . a power meter ( coherent labmax to ) with a sensitive detector ( lm-2 ) placed after the second polarizer was used to make fine adjustments of the orientation of the second polarizer to create an optimal extinction ratio of 10@xmath57 ( and then removed for data acquisition ) .",
    "the observed ratio includes effects of window birefringence and circular dichroism .",
    "a photomultiplier tube ( hamamatsu r636 - 10 ) detected the polarization signal .",

    "were observed than with rb@xmath4 ( @xmath59 rather than @xmath60 ) . also , due to spectral congestion in cs@xmath4 , the pump transitions were difficult to isolate .",
    "some of the pump transitions were confirmed by analyzing the resolved fluorescence recorded by a spex model 1404 0.85 m dual grating monochromator .",
    "other pump transitions were confirmed by scanning the pump laser while the probe laser was tuned to a previously assigned collisional peak .",
    "26 different @xmath61 transitions ( ground state @xmath62 and 52 @xmath63 ) were confirmed and 20 of them served as pump transitions in the experiment presented in this work .",

    ", we will designate a mixed @xmath263 state by @xmath264 [ hfsa ] where 0 , 1 , 2 denote @xmath265 states with @xmath266 , and @xmath267 denotes the @xmath0 state .",
    "let us consider a state that is nominally @xmath268 .",
    "considering the hamiltonian matrix elements in eqs .",
    "[ ham ] , there will be some degree of @xmath91 admixture , which we can estimate as @xmath269 considering only terms in @xmath270 and letting @xmath271 etc . , the hyperfine shifts of this nominal @xmath93 state become @xmath272 b b_{f}}{2\\xi^{so}_{b10 } } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\sim &   20 [ \\hat{f } - \\hat{j } - \\hat{i}]\\rm{khz},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] assuming @xmath273 @xmath13 and @xmath274 150 @xmath13 . for @xmath52=0 ,",
    "the result is 0 . in general ,",
    "@xmath275 . for given @xmath52 ,",
    "the maximum value of the expression in brackets is @xmath276 , and thus for @xmath277 ( the maximum @xmath207 value for cs@xmath4 ) , the maximum value of this term is @xmath278 khz . in reality , most @xmath279 state levels of interest will be mixed with @xmath0 , so this estimate should be taken as an upper limit .",
    "thus , although splitting of the cs atomic 6 @xmath237 state is 9.2 ghz , hyperfine shifts from the fermi contact term in cs@xmath4 @xmath263 @xmath23 states of low @xmath52 are less than one mhz , due to the relatively large fine structure splitting in cs@xmath4 .",
    "alternatively , one can say that for @xmath132 and @xmath158 , the electron spin precesses rapidly around the internuclear axis , thereby reducing terms in @xmath280 .    to our knowledge ,",
    "only one other hfs term besides the fermi contact term has been convincingly determined in alkali dimer states and that is the @xmath148 term , which was found to vary from zero to 9% @xmath270 in various vibrational levels of the @xmath281 state of nak @xcite ( the many fitted parameters of @xcite must be reviewed in light of the conclusions of @xcite ) . from eqs .",
    "( [ hfs ] ) , the @xmath148 term would affect the observed hfs shifts to a fraction comparable to that reported by @xcite .",
    "if @xmath282 levels of cs@xmath4 happen to be observed in cold molecule spectroscopy , then because the @xmath283 element is diagonal , the term in @xmath147 might be detected .",
    "if @xmath147 were also @xmath42 5% of @xmath270 , shifts could be several mhz .",
    "in the interest of providing a model of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 state potentials and energy level structure for use in the experiments directed to the production of cold molecules , we have made use of data from several sources , obtained for various purposes , as noted above . because the data are relatively sparse in certain regions , the analysis has required special procedures .",
    "questions that warrant further study have been noted above .",
    "for example , it appeared that some of the @xmath284 ( @xmath79 parity ) low vibrational levels , from the data of @xcite , could better be assigned to @xmath16 .",
    "as laser techniques improve , it would be interesting to attempt to access these levels with high resolution techniques .",
    "secondly , the second - order spin - orbit ( so2 ) corrections to the @xmath160 potential are quite large , and sensitively dependent on the relative potentials of perturbing states , as shown in fig .",
    "[ epots ] .",
    "more extensive data on @xmath160 levels might shed light on these so2 corrections . and finally , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ hfssec ] , it remains a challenge to observe hyperfine structure in levels with substantial @xmath149 character .",
    "this also would require enhanced laser techniques , such as used recently to study @xmath285 transitions in cs@xmath4 @xcite .",
