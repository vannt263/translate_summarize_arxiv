    "* statement of results . *",
    "it is known that there are classes of 2-cnfs that require nondeterministic read - once branching programs ( nrobps ) of exponential size for their representation . for example , in @xcite , we have essentially shown that a nrobp computing a monotone 2-cnf with a bounded number of occurrences of each variable is of size exponential in the pathwidth of the primal graph of the 2-cnf .",
    "an exponential lower bound is thus easy to obtain by taking a 2-cnf corresponding to an expander graph .",
    "a natural direction for further research is to understand the complexity of branching programs with higher repetition on monotone 2-cnfs .",
    "indeed , to the best of our knowledge , for 2-cnfs , there are no superpolynomial lower bounds for non - deterministic branching programs with a repetition higher than one , even for the restricted cases where the branching programs are allowed to be monotone or oblivious and deterministic .",
    "this work is an attempt to make a progress in this direction . instead of monotone 2-cnfs",
    "we consider _ padded _",
    "monotone 3-cnfs that are ` almost ' 2-cnfs .",
    "in particular each clause of a padded monotone 3-cnf contains a _ padding _ literal , that is a literal appearing in this clause only , the number of occurrences of the rest two literals is larger than @xmath3 .",
    "it is not hard to see that there is a one - to - one correspondence between padded monotone 3-cnfs and graphs without isolated vertices or vertices of degree @xmath3 . in particular , the cnf corresponding to such a graph @xmath4 has @xmath5 as the set of variables and the clauses correspond to the edges .",
    "in particular , literals of the clause corresponding to @xmath6 are the variable corresponding to @xmath7 and the variables corresponding to the end vertices of @xmath7 .",
    "we denote the cnf corresponding to @xmath4 by @xmath8 .    in this paper",
    "we consider the class of cnfs @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the complete graph of @xmath11 vertices .",
    "we estalish exponential lower bounds for non - deterministic read-@xmath0-times monotone branching programs and non - determinisitc read-@xmath0-times oblivous branching programs where @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the number of variables of the considered cnf and @xmath14 is a sufficiently large constant .",
    "in fact , in order to ` push ' as far as possible towards exponential lower bounds for non - deterministic read-@xmath0-times branching programs , we establish the exponential lower bounds for generalizations of non - deterministic monotone and oblivious read @xmath0-times branching programs that are specified below .",
    "let us parition the variables of @xmath8 into _ vertex variables _ ,",
    "i.e. those that correspond ot the vertices of @xmath4 and _ edge variables _ ) those that correspond to the edges of @xmath4 .",
    "the generalization of non - deterministic read-@xmath0-times monotone branching programs is called @xmath0-vertex edge monotone branching programs ( @xmath0-vembps ) . in this model vertex variables",
    "are allowed to appear at most @xmath0 times ( monotonicity is _ not _ required ) , while edge variables are required to be monotone , though the number of their occurrences is not limited .",
    "the generalization of non - deterministic oblivious read-@xmath0 times branching programs requires vertex variables to be oblivious and to occur at most @xmath0 on each _ consistent path _ ( that is , this restriction is _ semantic _ , while for @xmath0-vembp , the restriction is _ syntactic _ because it applies to each path ) .",
    "the edge variables are not constrained at all .",
    "we refer to this model @xmath0 vertex oblivious branching programs ( @xmath0-vobp ) .",
    "* overview of the proof .",
    "* as mentioned above , the considered class of cnfs is associated with ( undirected simple ) graphs as follows .",
    "given a graph @xmath4 , the cnf @xmath8 @xcite has variables @xmath15 ( the vertex variables ) and @xmath16 ( the edges variables ) and the clauses @xmath17 for each @xmath18 .",
    "the above class @xmath19 consists of @xmath9 for even @xmath11 where @xmath10 is a complete graph of @xmath11 vertices .",
    "the lower bounds are stated in theorem [ mainlower ] . in order to prove the theorem",
    ", we introduce a new graph parameter , which we call @xmath20-fold matching width .",
    "this is a generalization of matching width which we used to prove lower bounds in @xcite , in particular , the matching width can be seen as @xmath21-fold matching width .",
    "putting @xmath22 and using theorem 1.1 . from @xcite ,",
    "we show ( theorem [ cliquebound ] ) that the @xmath20-fold matching width of clique is at least @xmath23 .",
    "then we show ( resp .",
    "theorems [ mainupgraded ] and [ mainoblivious ] ) that for a graph @xmath4 with @xmath20-fold matching width at least @xmath24 , both @xmath0-vembp and @xmath0-vobp need an exponential size in @xmath25 to compute @xmath8 . theorem [ mainlower ] follows from combination of theorems [ cliquebound ] , [ mainupgraded ] , and [ mainoblivious ] .    in order to prove theorem [ mainupgraded ] , we associate a matching @xmath26 of @xmath4 with an ( essentially ) disjunction of cnf which we call a decision tree w.r.t .",
    "the main part of the proof is theorem [ manytrees ] stating that if @xmath27 is a set of decision trees w.r.t .",
    "matching of size @xmath24 such that every satisfying assignment of @xmath8 satisfies at least one element of @xmath27 then @xmath28 must be exponential in @xmath24 .",
    "we prove this by a probabilistic argument , defining a probability space over satisfying assignments of @xmath8 and showing that the probability of satisfying an individual decision tree w.r.t .",
    "a matching of size at least @xmath24 is exponentially small in @xmath24 .",
    "then theorem [ manytrees ] immediately follows by the union bound .",
    "theorem [ mainupgraded ] is then proved by showing that it is possible to define a function from a subset of length @xmath29 sequences of nodes of a @xmath0-vembp @xmath30 computing @xmath8 to decision trees w.r.t matchings of size at least @xmath24 so that every satisfying assignment of @xmath8 would satisfy a decision tree in the range of this function .",
    "it will immediately follow from theorem [ manytrees ] that size of the range is exponential in @xmath24 and hence so is the size of the domain ( upper - bounded by the number of @xmath29-sequences of nodes of @xmath30 ) of the function .",
    "we will conclude that the number of nodes of @xmath30 is exponential in @xmath25 .    to prove theorem [ mainoblivious ]",
    ", we specify a set @xmath31 of @xmath32 satisfying assignments of @xmath8 . for each @xmath33 , we specify a consistent root - leaf path @xmath34 of a @xmath0-vobp @xmath30 conputing @xmath8 whose labelling set of literals is a subset of @xmath35 . then , using ` superposition ' of paths , a standard ` fooling ' technique for proving lower bounds for oblivious branching programs , we identify on each @xmath34 at most @xmath29 nodes such that the respective vectors of these nodes do not coincide for any @xmath36 and @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",
    "then we apply the counting argument similar to the one mentioned in the end of the previous paragraph",

    "the author considered monotone padded @xmath39-cnfs in @xcite for non - deterministic semantic @xmath0-obdd , a special case on nondeterministic semantic oblivious read @xmath0-times branching programs where the sequence of variables on each computational path is a subsequence of @xmath0 copies of a _ fixed _ permutation .",
    "we are not aware of other results separating branching programs of bounded repetition from monotone @xmath40-cnfs or monotone padded @xmath39-cnfs .",
    "the only other results we are aware of that separate branching programs with repetition higher than @xmath3 and cnfs with constant length clauses are @xcite ( for nondeterministic read-@xmath0-times branching programs with @xmath41 for some constant @xmath14 ) and @xcite ( for randomized read-@xmath0-times branching programs with repetition @xmath42 for some constant @xmath14 and probability of error exponentially small in @xmath43 ) .",
    "both these results consider cnfs with all literals being negative , so the respective lower bounds clearly hold for monotone cnfs resulting from ` switching sign ' of literals .",

    "we denote by @xmath44 the set of variables whose literals occur in @xmath35 ( the @xmath45 notation naturally generalizes to cnfs and boolean functions ) .",
    "a set @xmath35 of literals represents the truth assignment to @xmath44 where variables occurring positively in @xmath35 ( i.e. whose literals in @xmath35 are positive ) are assigned with @xmath46 and the variables occurring negatively are assigned with @xmath47 .",

    "the _ size _ of @xmath30 denoted by @xmath60 is the number of its vertices .",
    "a well known way to obtain special classes of nbps is by imposing constraints on its root - leaf paths ( e.g. the number occurrences of each variable ) . if such a restriction is imposed on _ computational _ paths",

    "now we define two types of nbps computing @xmath8 .",
    "the first type has the following constraints : ( i ) on _ each _ root - leaf path , each vertex variable occurs at most @xmath0 times ; ( ii ) all the occurrences of edge variables on _ each _ root - leaf path are positive ( the branching program is monotone on edge variables ) but their repetition is unbounded",
    ".    note that the above constraints are _ syntactic _ because they apply to each root - leaf path of of the considered branching program .",
