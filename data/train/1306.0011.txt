    "spitzer mid - infrared observations of cepheid variables have been employed to constrain stellar mass - loss and anchor the cosmic distance scale ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "regarding the latter , the principal aim is to establish firmer constraints on the hubble constant and cosmological models @xcite .",
    "however , ambiguities linger concerning the form and metallicity - dependence of mid - infrared cepheid relations .",
    "the impetus for obtaining spitzer observations stems partly from the diminished impact of dust extinction on infrared - based distances ( @xmath7 ,  [ s - ext ] ) .",
    "crucially , uncertainties tied to neglecting variations in the extinction law are reduced .",
    "the extinction law varies throughout the galaxy , and a @xmath8% uncertainty ( @xmath9 ) merely contributes @xmath10 to the mid - infrared distance modulus ( assuming @xmath11 ) .",
    "conversely , variations in the extinction law can significantly impact cepheid and star cluster distances that rely solely on shorter - wavelength data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and discussion therein ) .",
    "the aforementioned points reiterate the importance of spitzer observations . however , a partial account provided below highlights the diverse opinions expressed concerning the form and metallicity - dependence of mid - infrared cepheid relations .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite cited different slopes for linear spitzer period - magnitude relations , while @xcite suggested that function is non - linear ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "for example , @xcite obtained @xmath12 for the slope of the 3.6 @xmath0 m relation using the ogle and sage datasets ( @xmath13 ) , whereas @xcite favored a steeper slope inferred by correlating the @xcite and sage catalogs ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "a shallower slope may arise partly from the inclusion of shorter - period cepheids that could suffer increased photometric contamination , particularly for distant targets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , @xcite deduced analogous period - magnitude relations for relatively nearby cepheids in the smc that occupy low and high density regions .",
    "[ fig - lmcpc ]    @xcite and @xcite found certain models produced spitzer period - magnitude and period - color relations that did not match observations spanning an extended abundance baseline ( see also * ? ? ? * and discussion therein ) .",
    "observations imply that the same slope characterizes 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m period - magnitude relations for smc and lmc cepheids @xcite , which exhibit mean abundances of @xmath4}\\sim-0.75,-0.33 $ ] accordingly @xcite .",
    "@xcite attempted to extend the baseline to include galactic cepheids ( @xmath4}\\sim0 $ ] ) , but the effort was marred by inconsistencies associated with the available calibrating data ( see also * ? ? ? * and discussion therein ) . @xcite and @xcite noted that the 4.5 @xmath0 m passband samples co absorption features , which presumably alter the spitzer cepheid relations and introduce a metallicity effect .",
    "@xcite confirmed the former finding by demonstrating that cooler long - period cepheids exhibit colors that are modulated by the absorption and disassociation of co , whereas their hotter short - period counterparts are less affected since the molecule is gradually disassociated .",
    "@xcite estimated that 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m cepheid data exhibit a metallicity dependence of @xmath15 and @xmath16 mag dex@xmath17 , respectively .",
    "the former estimate was revised by @xcite to @xmath18 mag dex@xmath17 .",
    "those results are tied partly to published abundance estimates for individual lmc cepheids , yet it is unclear whether systematic effects pervade such individual determinations , wesenheit function displays a nearly negligible dependence on metallicity , whereas certain researchers suggest otherwise @xcite . ]",
    "although a mean metallicity derived from an entire sample appears reliable @xcite .    in this study the form and metallicity dependence of spitzer period - magnitude and period - color relations are re - investigated .",
    "the relation linking the total extinction at 3.6 @xmath0 m ( @xmath19 ) to the optical color - excess ( @xmath20 ) is likewise derived from spitzer data , as the correlation is necessary for computing cepheid distances using the period - magnitude relations derived .",
    "3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m period - magnitude relations are now inferred from lmc and smc cepheids .",
    "the lmc sample was assembled by correlating hv cepheids tabulated by @xcite and @xcite with sage ( spitzer ) photometry ( a mean of random - phase data ) .",
    "fundamental mode cepheids cataloged by ogle were likewise added to the sample . for the smc analysis ,",
    "the @xcite and ogle catalogs were paired with sage photometry .",
    "a period cutoff of @xmath21 was imposed to : mitigate biases stemming from a reputed change in slope near @xmath22 @xcite , to ensure magnitude uncertainties were satisfactory , to reduce the effects of photometric contamination , and to ensure that brighter cepheids on the blue - edge of the instability strip were not preferentially sampled ( @xcite , see also appendix a in * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath23 limit was adopted to avoid the inclusion of leavitt variables @xcite , which may adhere to a separate slope ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their fig .  3 ) .",
    "the nearly mean - magnitude period - color ( 3.6 - 4.5 ) relation examined in  [ s - pcr ] is characterized by a higher - order polynomial over the baseline examined , thus hinting that the period - magnitude relations are non - linear .",
    "a single linear period - magnitude function does not adequately describe both the short and long - period domains ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "longer - period cepheids ( @xmath24 ) displayed a @xmath25 \\gtrsim 0^{m}.06 $ ] offset relative to a linear fit , whereby the latter fit yields values systematically too faint .",
    "longer - period cepheids are important granted the stars are preferentially sampled within remote galaxies in the hubble flow .",
    "efforts toward achieving precision cosmology ( @xmath26 % ) hinge on reducing sources of uncertainty for such stars , especially since certain cepheid - based determinations of @xmath27 exhibit tension with the new planck results ( * ? ? ?",

    "* and discussion therein ) .",
    "robust fitting routines were employed since the method of least - squares is acutely sensitive to outliers , whereas the former techniques are less affected by spurious data and more apt to identify the underlying trend .",
    "the robust routine applied seeks to minimize the sum of the absolute deviations , rather than the sum of the squared deviations .",
    "the routine was used in concert with a @xmath28 clip , twice iterated . that conservative procedure was followed because @xcite suggested that differences between the various determinations for the period - magnitude relation may arise partly from aggressive clipping / iterations .",
    "the following functional forms were deduced and characterize lmc cepheids across an extensive baseline ( @xmath1 ) : @xmath29 = ( 15.917 \\pm 0.026 ) -(3.077\\pm0.064 ) \\log{p_0 }   \\\\",

    "a single quadratic expression is preferred over two linear relations since the statistical weight of the entire cepheid demographic can be exploited to reduce uncertainties .",
    "relatively nearby short - period cepheids detected in the magellanic clouds outnumber their long - period counterparts , as low - mass metal - poor stars cross the instability strip with an extended blue - loop @xcite .",
    "the initial mass function implies that low - mass objects are more numerous , which in concert with the aforementioned trend , explains the shift in the distribution of magellanic cloud cepheids toward shorter - periods .",
    "the coefficients tied to the pulsation period in eqns .  [ eq - lmcpm ] and [ eq - smcpm ] agree to within the uncertainties .",

    "<S> the form and metallicity - dependence of spitzer mid - infrared cepheid relations are a source of debate . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , spitzer 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m period - magnitude and period - color diagrams were re - examined via robust routines , thus providing the reader an alternative interpretation to consider . </S>",
    "<S> the relations ( nearly mean - magnitude ) appear non - linear over an extensive baseline ( @xmath1 ) , particularly the period - color trend , which to first - order follows constant ( 3.6 - 4.5 ) color for shorter - period cepheids and may transition into a bluer convex trough at longer - periods . </S>",
    "<S> the period - magnitude functions can be described by polynomials ( e.g. , @xmath2 = k_0 -(3.071\\pm0.059 ) \\log{p_0}-(0.120\\pm0.032)\\log{p_0}^2 $ ] ) , and cepheid distances computed using 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m relations agree and the latter provides a first - order consistency check ( co sampled at 4.5 @xmath3 does not seriously compromise those distances ) . </S>",
    "<S> the period - magnitude relations appear relatively insensitive to metallicity variations ( @xmath4}\\sim0 $ ] to -0.75 ) , a conclusion inferred partly from comparing galaxy distances established from those relations and ned - d ( @xmath5 ) , yet a solid conclusion awaits comprehensive mid - infrared observations for metal - poor cepheids in ic 1613 ( @xmath4}\\sim -1 $ ] ) . the cepheid - based distances were corrected for dust obscuration using a new ratio ( i.e. , @xmath6 ) deduced from glimpse ( spitzer ) data . </S>"
