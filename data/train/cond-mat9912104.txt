    "macroscopic quantum tunnelling ( mqt ) represents one of the most fascinating phenomena in condensed matter physics .",
    "mqt means the tunnelling of a macroscopic variable through a barrier characterized by an effective potential of a macroscopic system . today , macroscopic systems showing amazing agreements with theoretical predictions are josephson junctions and squids . here , quantum tunnelling between two macroscopically distinct current states has been observed . after a slow evolution during the last ten years , mqt in magnetism now",
    "constitutes a new and very interesting field of research .",
    "it has been predicted that mqt can be observed in magnetic systems with low dissipation . in this case",
    ", it is the tunnelling of the magnetisation vector of a single  domain particle through its anisotropy energy barrier or the tunnelling of a domain wall through its pinning energy .",
    "these phenomena have been studied theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "this brief review focuses on mqt studied in individual nanoparticles or nanowires where the complications due to distributions of particle size , shape etc .",
    "are avoided .",
    "the experimental evidence of mqt in a single  domain particle or in assemblies of particles is still a controversial subject .",
    "therefore , we pay most attention to the necessary experimental conditions for mqt and review some experimental results .",
    "we start by reviewing some important predictions concerning mqt in a single  domain particle .",
    "on the theoretical side , it was shown that in small magnetic particles , a macroscopically large number of spins coupled by strong exchange interaction , can tunnel through the energy barrier created by magnetic anisotropy .",
    "it has been proposed that there is a characteristic crossover temperature @xmath0 below which the escape of the magnetisation from a metastable state is dominated by quantum barrier transitions , rather than by thermal over barrier activation . above @xmath0 the escape rate",
    "is given by thermal over barrier activation .    in order to compare experiments with theories , predictions of the crossover temperature @xmath0 and the escape rate @xmath1 in the quantum regime are relevant .",
    "both variables should be expressed as a function of parameters which can be changed experimentally .",
    "typical parameters are the number of spins @xmath2 , effective anisotropy constants , applied field strength and direction , etc .",
    "many theoretical papers have been published during the last few years @xcite .",
    "we discuss here a result specially adapted for single particle measurements which concerns the field dependence of the crossover temperature @xmath0 .",
    "the crossover temperature @xmath0 can be defined as the temperature where the quantum switching rate equals the thermal one .",
    "the case of a magnetic particle , as a function of the applied field direction , was considered by several authors @xcite .",
    "we have chosen the result for a particle with biaxial anisotropy as the effective anisotropy of most particles can be approximately described by a strong uniaxial and a weak transverse anisotropy .",
    "the result of kim can be written in the following form  @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the parallel and transverse anisotropy field given in tesla , @xmath6 is the angle between the easy axis of magnetisation and the direction of the applied field , and @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 is the classical switching field at zero temperature  @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ eq1 ] ) is valid for any ratio @xmath9 .",
    "the proportionality coefficient of equation ( [ eq1 ] ) is of the order of unity ( @xmath0 is in units of kelvin ) and depends on the approach of the calculation @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ eq1 ] ) is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for several values of the ratio @xmath10 .",
    "it is valid in the range @xmath11 .",
    "the most interesting feature which may be drawn from equation ( [ eq1 ] ) is that the crossover temperature is tuneable using the external field strength and direction ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) because the tunnelling probability is increased by the transverse component of the applied field .",
    "although at high transverse fields , @xmath0 decreases again due to a broadening of the anisotropy barrier .",
    "therefore , quantum tunnelling experiments should always include studies of angular dependencies .",
    "when the effective magnetic anisotropy of the particle is known , mqt theories give clear predictions with no fitting parameters .     as given by equation .",
    "( 1 ) , and for several values of the ratio @xmath9 . ]",
    "mqt should also be studied as a function of the effective magnetic anisotropy . in practice ,",
    "it is well known for single particle measurements that each particle is in reality somewhat different .",
    "therefore , the effective magnetic anisotropy has to be determined for each individual particle .    in general",
    ", @xmath0 does not depend directly on the particle volume because @xmath0 is proportional to the barrier and inversely proportional to the total spin of the particle .",
    "however , there is a slight volume dependence arising form the @xmath12dependence .",
    "as experiments are always limited by a certain time window and as the tunnelling rate is exponentially dependent on the particle volume , higher applied field values are required for larger particles to see the tunnelling in the given experimental time window , i.e. @xmath13 is small for larger particles . moreover ,",
    "the magnetisation reversal of larger particles becomes slightly incoherent , destroying mqt effects .",
    "therefore , the volume dependence ( i.e. @xmath12dependence ) of mqt should be studied in the particle size range where magnetisation reversal by uniform rotation exists .    finally , it is important to note that most of the mqt theories neglect damping mechanisms .",
    "we discussed the case of ohmic damping in ref .",
    "@xcite which is the simplest form of damping .",
    "more complicated damping mechanisms are not excluded and might play an important role .",
    "we expect more theoretical work on this in future .",
    "in order to avoid the complications due to distributions of particle size , shape etc . , some groups tried to study the thermal and field dependence of magnetisation reversal of individual magnetic particles or wires .",
    "most of the recent studies were done by using magnetic force microscopy at room temperature .",
    "low temperature investigations were mainly performed via resistance measurements .",
    "the first magnetisation measurements of individual single  domain nanoparticles at low temperature ( 0.1 @xmath14 t(k ) @xmath14 6 ) were presented by wernsdorfer _",
    "the detector ( a nb micro - bridge - dc - squid ) and the particles studied ( ellipses with axes between 50 and 1000 nm and thickness between 5 and 50 nm ) were fabricated using electron beam lithography .",
    "electrodeposited wires ( with diameters ranging from 40 to 100 nm and lengths up to 5000 nm ) were also studied @xcite .",
    "waiting time and switching field measurements showed that the magnetisation reversal of these particles and wires results from a single thermally activated domain wall nucleation , followed by a fast wall propagation reversing the particle s magnetisation .",
    "for nanocrystalline co particles of about 50 nm and below 1 k , a flattening of the temperature dependence of the mean switching field was observed which could not be explained by thermal activation .",
    "these results were discussed in the context of mqt of magnetisation .",
    "however the width of the switching field distribution and the probability of switching are in disagreement with such a model because nucleation is very sensitive to factors such as surface defects , surface oxidation and perhaps nuclear spins .",
    "the fine structure of pre - reversal magnetisation states is then governed by a multivalley energy landscape ( in a few cases distinct magnetisation reversal paths were effectively observed @xcite and the dynamics of reversal occurs via a complex path in configuration space .",
    "@xcite used telegraph noise spectroscopy to investigate the two  level fluctuations ( tlf ) observed in the conductance of a sample containing self - organising eras quantum wires and dots in a semi - insulating gaas matrix .",
    "they showed that the tlf could be related to two possible magnetic states of a eras cluster and that the energy difference between the two states was a linear function of the magnetic field .",
    "they deduced that the eras cluster should contain a few tens of er atoms . at temperatures between 0.35  k and 1  k ,",
    "the associated switching rate of the tlf were thermally activated , however below 350 mk the switching rate became temperature independent .",
    "tunnelling of the magnetisation was proposed in order to explain the observed behaviour .",
    "some open questions remain : what is the object which is really probed by tlf ?",
    "if this is a single eras particle , as assumed by the authors , the switching probability should be an exponential function of time .",
    "the pre - exponential factor @xmath15 ( sometimes called attempt frequency ) was found to lie between @xmath16 and @xmath17 s@xmath18 whereas expected values are between @xmath19 and @xmath20 s@xmath18 .",
    "why one must apply fields of about 2 teslas in order to measure two  level fluctuations which should be expected near zero field ? what is the influence of the measurement technique on the sample ?    by measuring the electrical resistance of isolated ni wires with diameters between 20 and 40 nm , hong and",
    "giordano studied the motion of magnetic domain walls @xcite . because of",
    "surface roughness and oxidation , the domain walls of a single wire are trapped at pinning centres .",
    "the pinning barrier decreases with an increase in the magnetic field . when the barrier is sufficiently small , thermally activated escape of the wall occurs .",
    "this is a stochastic process which can be characterised by a switching ( depinning ) field distribution .",
    "a flattening of the temperature dependence of the mean switching field and a saturation of the width of the switching field distribution ( rms .",
    "deviation @xmath21 ) were observed below about 5 k. the authors proposed that a domain wall escapes from its pinning sites by thermal activation at high temperatures and by quantum tunnelling below @xmath22 5 k.    these measurements pose several questions : what is the origin of the pinning center which may be related to surface roughness , impurities , oxidation etc . ?",
    "the sweeping rate dependence of the depinning field , as well as the depinning probability , could not be measured even in the thermally activated regime .",
    "therefore , it was not possible to check the validity of the nel  brown model @xcite or to compare measured and predicted rms .",
    "deviations @xmath21 .",
    "finally , a crossover temperature @xmath0 of about 5 k is three orders of magnitude higher than @xmath0 predicted by current theories .",
    "later , wernsdorfer _ et al .",
    "_ published results obtained on nanoparticles synthesised by arc discharge , with dimensions between 10 and 30 nm @xcite .",
    "these particles were single crystalline , and the surface roughness was about two atomic layers .",
    "their measurements showed for the first time that the magnetisation reversal of a ferromagnetic nanoparticle of good quality can be described by thermal activation over a single  energy barrier as proposed by nel and brown @xcite .",
    "the activation volume , which is the volume of magnetisation overcoming the barrier , was very close to the particle volume , predicted for magnetisation reversal by uniform rotation .",
    "no quantum effects were found down to 0.2 k. this was not surprising because the predicted crossover temperature is @xmath22 20 mk .",
    "the results of wernsdorfer _ et al . _ constitute the preconditions for the experimental observation of mqt of magnetisation on a single particle .",
    "just as the results obtained with co nanoparticles @xcite , a quantitative agreement with the nel  brown model of magnetisation reversal was found on bafeo nanoparticles @xcite .",
    "although , strong deviations from this model were evidenced for the smallest particles containing about @xmath23 and for temperatures below 0.4 k. these deviations are in good agreement with the theory of macroscopic quantum tunnelling of magnetisation .",
    "the main results are reviewed in the following section .",
    "other low temperature techniques which are adapted to single particle measurements are hall probe magnetometry  @xcite , magnetometry based on the giant magnetoresistance or spin - dependent tunneling with coulomb blockade  @xcite .",
    "this section presents a brief discussion of individual particle measurements suggesting quantum effects at low temperature . in order to confirm the single ",
    "domain character of the particles , the magnetisation reversal as a function of the applied field direction were studied for each particle . for co and bafecotio nanoparticles with diameters between 10 and 30 nm ,",
    "it was found that the angular dependence of the switching field @xmath24 agrees well with the model of stoner and wohlfarth @xcite taking into account mainly second and small fourth order anisotropy terms .",
    "the effective magnetocrystalline anisotropy field ( the main second order anisotropy term ) , found by these measurements for particles with a co@xmath25ti@xmath25 substitution , is about 0.4 t. a detailed discussion of the angular dependence of @xmath8 is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the influence of temperature and time on the statistics of the magnetisation reversal was studied by waiting time and switching field experiments .",
    "both types of measurements were studied as a function of the applied field direction . except in some special cases at very low temperatures ,",
    "these measurements were in complete agreement with the nel  brown theory @xcite : ( i ) exponential probabilities of not - switching with mean waiting times following an arrhenius law ; ( ii ) mean switching fields and widths of the switching field distribution following the model of kurkij@xmath26rvi @xcite .",
    "this agreement could be confirmed by studying the angular dependence of the anisotropy barrier @xmath27 following roughly the prediction of the stoner and wohlfarth @xcite .",
    "the number of spins @xmath2 in the nanoparticle can be estimated by @xmath28 .",
    "we found values of @xmath29 to @xmath30 depending on the particles size .",
    "finally , the angular dependence of @xmath31 followed well the prediction of coffey _ et al .",
    "the phenomenological damping constant @xmath32 from gilbert s equation could be found : @xmath33 in the case of co and @xmath34 in the case of bafecotio @xcite .",
    "such values are expected for metallic and insulating particles , respectively .    below 0.4 k ,",
    "several of the smallest particles showed strong deviations from the nel brown model .",
    "these deviations were a saturation of the thermal dependence of @xmath35 and @xmath21 , and a faster field sweeping rate dependence of @xmath35 than given by the nel  brown model . in order to investigate the possibility that these low temperature deviations are due to an escape from the metastable potential by mqt , a common method is to replace the real temperature @xmath36 by an effective temperature @xmath37 in order to restore the scaling plot . in the case of mqt",
    ", @xmath37 should saturate at low temperatures .",
    "indeed , the ansatz of @xmath37 , can restore unequivocally the scaling plot demonstrated by a straight master curve .",
    "the flattening of @xmath38 corresponds to a saturation of the escape rate @xmath39 which is a necessary signature of mqt . as measurements at zero temperature",
    "are impossible , the effective temperature at the lowest measuring temperature can be investigated and one can define the crossover temperature between thermally activated and the quantum regime by @xmath40 at lowest measuring temperature .",
    "the measured angular dependence of @xmath41 is in excellent agreement with the prediction given by equation ( 1 ) ( fig .",
    "the normalisation value @xmath42 = 0.31 k compares well with the theoretical value of about 0.2 k. this quantitative agreement of the crossover temperature versus an external parameter suggest mqt in these bafecotio particles .",
    "measurements on other particles with anisotropies between @xmath43 = 0.3 t and 1 t showed that @xmath41 is about proportional to @xmath43 .",
    "furthermore , for a given anisotropy field @xmath43 , @xmath41 decreased for bigger particles which is also in agreement with equation ( 1 ) as @xmath41 is proportion to @xmath44 ( for a larger particle , @xmath13 must be smaller in order to measure a magnetisation switching in the same time window , which is fixed by the field sweeping rate .",
    "finally , the width of the switching field distribution should be constant in the quantum regime which was also verified .",
    "the test of the validity for @xmath45 and @xmath46 would be interesting .",
    "however , the limit @xmath47 is experimentally very difficult as the measurable signal at the magnetisation reversal becomes smaller and smaller for @xmath47 .",
    "furthermore , by using the micro ",
    "squid technique , one can only sweep the applied magnetic field in the plane of the squid , i.e. in order to measure in the limit of @xmath45 , the easy axis of magnetisation needs to be in the plane of the squid which has not yet been achieved for a small particle .      in the case of 20 nm co particles",
    ", no clear quantum effects were found down to 0.2 k. this was not surprising for two reasons : ( i ) the calculated crossover temperature for such a particle is smaller than 0.2 k and ( ii ) the dissipation effects due to conduction electrons may strongly reduce quantum effects which should not be the case in insulating bafecotio particles having a very small damping factor @xcite .",
    "although the above measurements are in good agreement with mqt theory , we should not forget that the mqt is based on several strong assumptions . among them",
    ", there is the assumption of a giant spin , i.e. all magnetic moments in the particle are rigidly coupled together by strong exchange interaction",
    ". this approximation might be good in the temperature range where thermal activation is dominant but is it not yet clear if this approximation can be made for very low energy barriers .",
    "future measurements will tell us the answer",
    ".    the proof for mqt in a magnetic nanoparticle could be the observation of level quantisation of its collective spin state which was recently evidenced in molecular mn@xmath48 and fe@xmath49 clusters having a collective spin state @xmath50 . also the quantum spin phase or berry phase associated with the magnetic spin @xmath50 of a fe@xmath49 molecular cluster",
    "was evidenced @xcite . in the case of bafecotio particles with s",
    "= @xmath30 , the field separation associated with the level quantisation is rather small : @xmath51 0.002 mt . future measurements should focus on the level quantisation of collective spin states of @xmath52 to @xmath53 and their quantum spin phases"
