    "the concept of gravitational radiation has been with us for quite a long time .",
    "thinking of the relativistic gravitational field in parallel with the familiar case of the electromagnetic field , it was natural to expect that there should exist waves of the gravitational field similar to the waves of the electromagnetic field .",
    "as einstein @xcite put it in 1913 :  the conviction had to come that newton s law of gravitation is as incapable of desribing all gravitational phenomena as coulomb s laws of electrostatics and magnetostatics are of electromagnetic phenomena \" .",
    "the decades of hard work have followed . in the beginning ,",
    "the research was purely theoretical . through doubts and controversies , the conceptual and mathematical issues of gravitational radiation",
    "have been clarified .",
    "then , in the 60-s , the experimental work has started with the pioneering effort of j. weber @xcite . in the 90-s",
    ", gravitational waves have been observed indirectly via the measurement of secular changes in the orbital parameters of the binary system of neutron stars that includes the pulsar psr 1913 + 16 @xcite .",
    "these days , gravitational waves are routinely taken into account in the theoretical and observational studies ranging from orbital evolution of close pairs of compact stars to the early universe cosmology .",
    "the experimental progress has also been very impressive .",
    "we are now at a special and decisive p[oint .",
    "first , the relevance and importance of gravitational - wave research is fully recognised by the communities of physicists and astronomers .",
    "the worldwide network of scientific collaborations has been established , reflecting the necessity of coincident observations at various instruments and the need for joint analysis of the data @xcite , @xcite .",
    "second , the scientific runs have begun at the recently assembled sensitive laser - interferometric observatories - american ligo @xcite and british - german geo600 @xcite .",
    "the french - italian virgo @xcite will be operational soon .",
    "meanwhile , the japanese tama300 @xcite , along with the international network of bar detectors @xcite , continue to collect data at their level of sensitivity .",
    "the design sensitivity of three ligo interferometers plus virgo and geo600 meets the realistic astrophysical predictions , so the direct detection of powerful ( even if rare ) sources , such as coalescing stellar - mass black holes , becomes likely .",
    "third , the european space agency ( esa ) and american nasa have agreed to share the costs of the space - based laser interferometer space antena ( lisa ) @xcite .",
    "lisa is planned to be launched around the year 2011 , preceeded by a technology demonstration mission .",
    "the plans for the advanced ground - based detectors , such as ligo ii , the japanese cryogenic laser interferometer lcgt , and , possibly , the european euro , are also maturing very quickly .",
    "these instruments of the next generation will detect a host of well anticipated sources , such as compact binary stars , but really fundamental discoveries are also expected .",
    "fourth , there exists a strong competition on the side of purely astronomical means of indirect detection of gravitational waves .",
    "in fact , the anisotropy and polarisation measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) are likely to bring us decisive information on the fundamentally important relic gravitational waves much earlier than it will be done by direct methods . by all counts",
    ", gravitational - wave research is now one of the most exciting and promising areas of physical science .    the weakness of gravity as a physical interaction is the strength of gravitational waves as a tool of scientific research .",
    "it is difficult to detect gravitational waves because they carry their energy practically without scattering and absorption .",
    "but this is exactly because of this difficulty that we have any chance to learn about what was happening at the beginning of the universe , or in the depth of an exploding supernova , or in the vicinity of , what we think are , merging black holes .",
    "it is also likely that the differing properties of gravitational waves will be a discriminating signature of different fundamental physical theories and modified gravities .    in this review",
    ", we will start , in sec .",
    "2 , with an elementary theory of gravitational waves . then , in sec . 3",
    ", we will discuss the current status of gravitational - wave experiments . in sec .",
    "4 we will focus on astrophysical sources of gravitational waves and the new physics that will be learned from their observation . sec . 5",
    "is devoted to gravitational waves and cosmology .",
    "in particular , some recent results from the wmap will be discussed in the context of gravitational - wave research , including the  implications for inflation \" . finally , we briefly summarise this update in sec .",
    "the background material on the gravitational - wave research can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and some of the previous reviews in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "there are some similarities in the mathematical description of the gravitational field and the electromagnetic field .",
    "the electromagnetic field can be described by the components of the 4-vector potential @xmath0 .",
    "the quantities @xmath0 are functions of time and spatial coordinates @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and they obey the wave - like dynamical equations - the maxwell equations .",
    "other quantities , such as electric and magnetic components @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and the energy - momentum tensor of the electromagnetic field , are calculable from @xmath0 .",
    "the quantities @xmath0 allow the gauge freedom .",
    "this means that some seemingly different solutions of the field equations are in fact equivalent solutions in the sense of their physical manifestations .",
    "analogously , the gravitational field can be described by 10 components of the @xmath5 symmetric tensor @xmath6 as functions of @xmath1 .",
    "the quantities @xmath6 obey the nonlinear wave - like dynamical equations - the einstein equations .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor of the gravitational field @xmath7 is calculable from the tensor @xmath6 .",
    "the quantities @xmath6 allow the gauge freedom , so that some seemingly different solutions of the gravitational field equations describe in fact the physically equivalent configurations .",
    "in contrast to the electromagnetic field , the gravitational field @xmath6 is a nonlinear field .",
    "this means that a sum of two solutions of the field equations is not a new solution , and the gravitational field , along with matter fields , is a source for itself .",
    "however , in a number of situations one can neglect the nonlinearity of the gravitational field . in this approximation",
    "we come to the notion of weak gravitational fields and linearised gravitational waves .",
    "many properties of linearised gravitational waves resemble those of electromagnetic waves .",
    "gravitational waves propagate with the velocity of light @xmath8 and have two independent transvers polarization states . in its action on free masses , a gravitational wave ( g.w . )",
    "exhibits some analogs of the electric and magnetic contributions of an electromagnetic wave ( em.w . ) acting on free electric charges . gravitational wave field",
    "is dimensionless and its strength can be characterized by a dimensionless amplitude @xmath9 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath9 decreases in the course of propagation from a localized source in inverse proportion to the traveled distance : @xmath10 .",
    "gravitational waves carry away from a radiating system its energy , angular momentum and linear momentum .",
    "the linearised g.w .",
    "satisfy the wave equation @xmath11 where the ordinary derivative is denoted by a comma and @xmath12 is the metric tensor of the minkowski space - time : @xmath13 the first term in eq .",
    "( [ lgw ] ) is the familiar dalembert ( wave ) operator . a plane - wave solution to eq .",
    "( [ lgw ] ) is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 , reflecting the fact that a g.w .",
    "propagates with the velocity of light .",
    "because of this condition , the field equations ( [ lgw ] ) require the 10 components of the constant matrix @xmath16 to satisfy 4 constraints : @xmath17 .",
    "then , the quantities @xmath18 and @xmath19 can be expressed in terms of 6 components of the matrix @xmath20 .",
    "this matrix itself includes the part @xmath21 satisfying the further 4 constraints : @xmath22 .",
    "these remaining 2 degrees of freedom ( sometimes called the tt - components ) fully determine the observational manifestations of the plane wave and its energy - momentum characteristics . indeed",
    ", it is easy to show that the gravitational energy - momentum tensor @xmath23\\ ] ] depends only on the tt - components of the field : @xmath24,\\ ] ] where we have dropped ( as we normally do in the case of electromagnetic waves ) the purely oscillatory terms .",
    "how does a gravitational wave affect the free ( i. e. not subject to any other forces or constraints ) masses ? in the case of an em.w .",
    ", we could have noticed the displacement of a charged particle with respect to a neutral particle placed initially in the same point . in the case of a gravitational wave , there is no particles neutral to the gravitational interaction , so we need to study the relative displacement of particles separated initially .",
    "this brings us to the analysis of tidal effects of a gravitational wave , similar to the tidal effects of a newtonian gravitational field .",
    "let one of free masses define the origin of our coordinate system , @xmath25 , whereas the second mass is placed initially at @xmath26 and its ( small ) displacement caused by the gravitational wave is denoted by @xmath27 .",
    "then the equations of motion of the second mass are : @xmath28 these equations depend only on the tt - components of the wave .    for a wave propagating , say , in @xmath29-direction",
    "it is convenient to write the tt - components explicitely : @xmath30 then , the relevant solution to eq .",
    "( [ mrelmotws ] ) reads @xmath31    the masses that lie ( on average ) on the ring @xmath32 , oscillate around their ring positions . in fig .",
    "1 we show a quarter of the cycle caused by a wave with the @xmath33 polarization state ( i.e. when @xmath34 )",
    ". the pattern of oscillations enforced by the @xmath35 polarization state ( i.e. when @xmath36 ) can be obtained from fig . 1 by its rotation by the angle @xmath37 in the @xmath38 plane",
    ". the general motion of a particle is a linear superposition of these oscillations , as seen in eq .",
    "( [ sol ] ) .",
    "the oscillatory deformation of a sphere of masses , surrounding the central mass at the origin , is desribed by a liner combination of spherical harmonics @xmath39 with @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and where the polar axis is taken along the @xmath29 direction .",
    "equations ( [ sol ] ) suggest that the motion of free particles is confined strictly to the planes @xmath42 this conclusion comes about only because we have so far neglected the smaller terms , containing the products of @xmath43 with the extra small factor @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the separation between masses and @xmath46 is the gravitational wavelength . when these terms are taken into account",
    ", the perturbed positions @xmath47 and , most importantly , @xmath29 receive further contributions .",
    "the gravitational wave drives the masses not only in the plane of the wave - front , but also , to a smaller extent , back and forth in the propagation direction @xcite .",
    "this extra component of motion is similar to the one caused by the magnetic field and the lorentz force of the em.w .",
    "acting on a charged particle . in fig .",
    "2 we show typical displacements of the masses forming ( on average ) the plane @xmath48 , when the  magnetic \" contribution to their motion is also taken into account . it is seen from this figure that the entire plane of particles is being bent in an oscillatory fashion . this  magnetic \" component of motion will play a certain role in the analysis of observations with laser interferometers @xcite .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath49 are determined by the source of the gravitational waves . to find the amplitudes",
    ", we should replace the zero in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ lgw ] ) by the source term @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the energy - momentum tensor of the source , and seek the retarded solutions to the wave equation . assuming that the distance @xmath52 to the source is much larger than the wavelength , one can write [ atild2 ] h_+(k _ ) = [ ^11(k_)- ^22(k _ ) ] ,   h_(k _ )",
    "= ^12(k _ ) , where the fourier components @xmath53 are defined by ^(k_)= ( t^(t_r , r_0 ) d^3 r_0 ) e^-ik_x^ d^4x and @xmath54 is retarded time .",
    "these formulas allow one to evaluate the typical amplitude @xmath9 from a given source : [ ampl ] h ~ ( ) ^2 , where @xmath55 is the total mass of the source and @xmath56 is the characteristic non - spherical velocity of the matter bulk motion . for a bound system like a binary star , @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the size of the system .",
    "an accurate calculation for a binary in a circular orbit , consisting of masses @xmath59 , @xmath60 separated by the distance @xmath58 , and after averaging over the orbital period and orientation of the orbital plane , gives [ amplb ] h = ( h_+^2 + h_^2)^1/2= ( ) ^1/2 ( f)^2/3 , where the emitted g.w .",
    "frequency @xmath61 ( in @xmath62 ) is f = ^1/2 .",
    "note that the amplitude @xmath9 depends on a particular combination of masses : [ chirp ] = m^5/3 ,  where   m= , so that @xmath63 and @xmath64 is sometimes called a chirp mass .",
    "the possible methods of detecting gravitational waves , as well as the associated difficulties , can be seen from the discussion above .",
    "fig.1 is helpful for understanding the principles of mechanically coupled detectors ( bar detectors ) and electromagnetically coupled detectors ( laser interferometers ) .",
    "a bar detector is essentially a mechanical oscillator consisting of two masses connected by a spring . as an illustration",
    ", one can think of two elastically connected masses lying , say , at the opposite ends of the @xmath65 axis in fig .",
    "1 . the size of bar detectors is normally small , a couple of meters or so .",
    "a bar detector is a relatively narrow - band instrument .",
    "it is mostly sensitive to g.w .",
    "frequencies in the vicinity of the main eigen - frequency of the bar . in the presently operating instruments the resonant frequency is around @xmath66 .",
    "there are some advantages in using spherically shaped mechanical detectors .",
    "the construction of such detectors is currently taking place ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "while the operating bar detectors continue to collect useful information @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , we will concentrate on laser interferometers .",
    "the laser interferometer technique is based on free masses - mirrors whose relative distances are monitored by bouncing light . a ground - based interferometer is normally an @xmath67-shaped configuration .",
    "the light beamsplitter is in the corner of @xmath67 , while the reflecting mirrors are at the ends of the configuration and near the beam splitter .",
    "the central mass in fig.1 is an illustration of the beamsplitter and corner mirrors , whereas the end mirrors are located , say , in the positive directions of @xmath65 and @xmath68 . obviously , mirrors in real interferometers are not free masses , they are suspended like pendulums .",
    "but they behave essentially as free masses in their motion along the corresponding arm .",
    "the length of the arms of an interferometer can be large .",
    "for instance , it ranges from 600 meters in geo600 to @xmath69 in largest of ligo interferometers .",
    "in contrast to bar detectors , laser interferometers are relatively broad - band instruments .",
    "they are sensitive to frequencies in the interval @xmath70 .",
    "fig.1 shows the simplest case of a single monochromatic wave with one polarisation state arriving from the orthogonal direction to the detector s plane , but the response of the detector to the general case of the incoming wave is also calculable .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ sol ] ) that the relative displacement of free masses is proportional to the incoming wave amplitude @xmath9 : @xmath71 .",
    "which numerical values of @xmath9 can be expected from astrophysical sources in the surrounding universe  ?",
    "consider one of the most powerful and efficient emmitters - a pair of compact stars orbiting each other at a tight orbit . specifically , consider two neutron stars with masses @xmath72 at the late stage of their inspiral .",
    "orbiting each other at separation @xmath73 , they emit gravitational waves at frequency @xmath74 the emitted intensity of radiation is very high by astronomical standards : @xmath75 . let the distance to the source be @xmath76 .",
    "we can not take this distance much shorter than @xmath77 , because the expected number of such events per year in a smaller volume of the surrounding universe would be less than 1 .",
    "then , formula ( [ amplb ] ) says that the amplitude at earth is @xmath78 .",
    "this is an increadibly small number .",
    "it enters any conceivable method of detection of gravitational waves and explains why it is so difficult to observe them . in a @xmath79 long interferometer",
    ", we need to beat all the noises and measure the mirror s displacements at the level of @xmath80 .",
    "the interferometer monitors the time - dependent difference of the relative distance variations in the two arms . using the terminology of solid state physics , this quantity",
    "is called the ( dimensionless ) strain . regardless of the presence or absense of the useful g.w .",
    "signal , there will always be some strain noise @xmath81 in the output of the detector .",
    "the mean - square value of the noise can be expressed as an integral over the noise power spectral density @xmath82 : [ powsd ] = 2 _ 0^ s_n(f ) df",
    ". the square root of @xmath82 is the noise amplitude @xmath83 .",
    "this quantity has the dimensionality of @xmath84 , and it is this quantity that is usually plotted on the sensitivity graphs . in fig .",
    "3 ( taken from @xcite ) we show the recent status of the noise amplitudes in the @xmath79 interferometer of the ligo livingston cite .",
    "one can see the great progress that has been made on the way of reaching the design goal of sensitivity , shown by the solid line .",
    "the lower frequency part of the sensitivity curve is dominated by seismic perturbations , the central part by thermal noise in mirror s suspensions , and the higher frequency part by the shot noise of the laser light .",
    "the advanced ligo sensitivity curve will be lower than the solid line in fig.3 by a factor of 10 across all the frequencies .",
    "this upgrade of ligo is planned to take place in about the year 2007 .",
    "the advanced instruments will also allow optical configurations in which the sensitivity can be increased in a certain narrow frequency band at the expense of lowering the sensitivity outside the chosen band .    to compare qualitatively the astrophysical signal @xmath85 , represented by the dimensionless amplitude @xmath9 , with the detector s r.m.s .",
    "noise @xmath86 , we should calculate , as formula ( [ powsd ] ) suggests , the product @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the appropriate bandwidth in the noise spectrum . taking the initial ligo design sensitivity @xmath89 at @xmath90 and @xmath91 , we would get @xmath92 .",
    "this @xmath86 is a factor of 5 higher than the signal @xmath93 from the coalescing neutron stars considered above .",
    "the ratio @xmath94 would suggest that , by a significant margin , the signal is not measurable .",
    "the reality , however , is somewhat better than this estimate .",
    "one should take into account the apriori knowledge of the expected waveform .",
    "if the waveform is known , one can use the well developed technique of matched filtering .",
    "this method recovers the signal by , effectively , reducing the appropriate @xmath88 and the relevant amount of detector s noise . for a quasi - periodic signal ,",
    "this is achieved by using a long observation time t : @xmath95 . in the case of a coalescing binary , the dominant g.w .",
    "frequency is increasing with time , but the binary still executes almost @xmath96 cycles before changing its frequency by a factor of 2 .",
    "this points out to a possible increase of the estimated @xmath97 by a factor @xmath98 .",
    "the importance of accurate modelling of the expected waveforms is well appreciated .",
    "presently , this is an important challenge for theorists ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "4 ( taken from @xcite ) shows the accurately calculated @xmath97 ratios for the initial laser interferometers .",
    "as expected , the @xmath97 grows with the total mass @xmath55 of the coalescing binary , because the signal gets larger .",
    "however , binaries with the total mass greater than about @xmath99 radiate at too low frequencies before merging . at these low frequencies",
    "the detector noise is high , as seen in fig .",
    "therefore , the @xmath97 decreases again .",
    "certainly , the equal mass binaries with the total mass greater than @xmath100 can only be pairs of black holes , according to our present understanding of stars and stellar evolution .",
    "the ligo - geo collaboration has reported @xcite the first upper limits on coalescing binary systems , as well as other possible g.w .",
    "these limits were derived from observations at the currently achieved sensitivity .",
    "they are not yet significant from the astrophysical point of view , but , outside the frequency interval probed by the bar detectors , they are tighter than other upper limits experimentally established so far .",
    "the necessary steps for increasing the sensitivity in the initial and advanced ground - based interferometers are well recognised and are being taken up",
    ".    the space - based interferometer lisa will be sensitive to g.w . in the interval @xmath101 , that is , to lower g.w .",
    "frequencies as compared with ground - based instruments .",
    "some new types of astronomical sources will be accessible to this detector .",
    "lisa will consist of three spacecraft , forming an equilateral triangle of side 5 million km , in a heliocentric orbit , lagging behind the earth by @xmath102 .",
    "the phase shifts of the laser light traveing along all three sides of the triangle will monitor the light - travel distance between the small drag - free test masses inside the spacecraft .",
    "the nominal lifetime of the mission is 5 years .",
    "fig.5 shows the lisa design sensitivity curve and some of interesting sources of gravitational waves .",
    "this single figure attempts to show the noise curve of the entire assembly of spacecraft together with the strengths of g.w .",
    "sources of different nature - from quasi - periodic to stochastic - and therefore the figure should be treated with some care . the instrumental noise level is shown here in bins of @xmath103 , which are appropriate for a 1 year integration time .",
    "in other words , the r.m.s .",
    "instrumental noise @xmath83 in units of @xmath104 ( see eq.([powsd ] ) ) is multiplied with @xmath105 at each frequency , thus producing a dimensionless spectral quantity .",
    "( for the latest amendments of the lisa noise curve see , for example , @xcite . )",
    "this is done mainly in order to emphasize that during this observational time the g.w .",
    "signals from many of the galactic white - dwarf binaries can be resolved and removed from the data .",
    "this means that their g.w .",
    "noise will not prevent us from seeing something much more interesting - a stochastic background of relic gravitational waves .",
    "the sharp drop of signal from the galactic binary white dwarfs , shown in fig.5 at @xmath106 , illustrates this assumed operation with the data @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and not the total lack of galactic binaries radiating at frequencies higher than @xmath107 .",
    "the continuation of this curve at @xmath108 shows the much smaller g.w .",
    "noise from unresolved extragalactic white dwarf binaries . in accord with this way of describing the dimensionless instrumental noise , the dimensionless g.w .",
    "signal amplitudes are also calculated in bins of @xmath103 around any given frequency @xmath61 . in the next section",
    ", we will present more details on astrophysical sources for ground - based and space - based instruments .",
    "it is common to divide the sources in groups , depending on whether they are accessible to ground - based or space - based instruments .",
    "it is also common to call them , respectively , the high - frequency and low - frequency sources .",
    "we will focus on the sources that are likely to be the first sources detected by the ground - based instruments .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ ampl ] ) that a powerful source of gravitational waves should involve large masses and relativistic velocities . a pair of neutron stars inspiraling toward each other under the influence of the g.w .",
    "radiation reaction force is a primary example . in the last few seconds of inspiral , before the neutron stars  touch \" each other and merge , the frequency of gravitational radiation increases from @xmath109 to about @xmath110 .",
    "the orbital velocity increases from @xmath111 to @xmath112 . in the last few seconds",
    "the binary emits @xmath113 of energy in the form of gravitational waves .",
    "this is a 2@xmath114 of its total rest - mass energy @xmath115 . what can be more powerful and efficient a source of gravitational radiation than this one ?",
    "only a pair of even more massive and even more compact stars .",
    "astronomers call them stellar - mass black holes .    if the coalescence of a binary neutron star ( ns+ns ) or a binary black hole ( bh+bh ) happened in our galaxy , it would be easily detectable by the already operating instruments .",
    "the problem is that these catastrophic events are expected to take place only once per a very long while . in order to have a reasonable chance of seeing , say , 3 events per year",
    ", we have to survey a large volume of space , which includes many galaxies .",
    "this means that the instrument s sensitivity should be so high , that the events could be seen from the edges of this large volume .",
    "this consideration explains the importance of theoretical evaluations of the event rates in a typical galaxy .",
    "the event rate of coalescing ns+ns systems is partially constrained by pulsar observations in our galaxy .",
    "three ns+ns binaries are known , each involving a pulsar , whose coalescence time is less than the hubble time and is , on average , @xmath116 years . starting with these 3 binaries",
    ", one would evaluate the ns+ns event rate as 1 per 100 million years .",
    "however , we observe only about 1@xmath114 of the galactic volume , so the coalescence rate can easily be raised to @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "very likely , the event rate for ns+ns systems is significantly higher than this estimate , if only because of the fact that not all ns+ns systems include a currently observable pulsar .",
    "the observational situation with black holes is more uncertain .",
    "there are a dozen of bh candidates in x - ray binary systems , but they all are in pairs with non - degenerate companions .",
    "so far , there is no observational evidence for ns+bh or bh+bh binaries .",
    "nevertheless , one can make some evaluations on the basis of the star formation rates .",
    "it is believed that the neutron star progenitors have masses greater than @xmath118 , whereas the black hole progenitors have masses greater than @xmath99 .",
    "the salpeter function for the star formation rate is @xmath119 integrating this function over @xmath55 and using the lower limit of integration , one finds the ratio of the expected numbers of progenitors : @xmath120 it is reasonable to think that , despite all the complexities and differences in binary evolution , the ratio of coalescence rates will also be given by approximately the same quantity , @xmath121 this expectation turns out to be in rough agreement with the results of detailed numerical population synthesis calculations .",
    "numerical calculations take into account all the available observational information .",
    "their advantage is in that one can follow not only the channels leading to the ns+ns , ns+bh , bh+bh systems , most interesting for gravitational - wave astronomy , but also other evolutionary outcomes , which allow comparison with observations in their own right .",
    "the population synthesis results can not be less reliable than purely  observational \" estimates , as they are controlled by the same available observational data .",
    "discrepancies in final results exist because of uncertainties in astrophysics , not because one of the methods is inherently less reliable than another .",
    "this is especially true with regard to the ns+bh and bh+bh binaries , where the current purely  observational \" evaluations would have to begin with zero .    the results of conservative population synthesis calculations @xcite , @xcite have been checked on their consistency with other evolutionary outcomes .",
    "the calculations show that the ns+ns rate is expected to be at the level @xmath122 , whereas the bh+bh rate is at least one order of magnitude lower . for further estimates",
    "we will take it at the level @xmath123 .",
    "these rates for a typical galaxy , @xmath124 , determine the rates for a given cosmological volume , @xmath125 , which includes many galaxies . when deriving the @xmath125 , it is convenient to use a conservative estimate for the baryon content of the universe .",
    "this brings us to the relationship @xmath126 thus , it is expected that within the volume of radius @xmath127 and during 1 year , there will be 3 of ns+ns events and only 0.2 of ns+bh or bh+bh events .",
    "the increase of the radius to @xmath128 increases the volume and the event rates by a factor 8 .",
    "it is interesting to note that , despite all the diversity of approaches in the literature , there exists some tendency to convergence of the final results @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the derived event rates are the basis for the calculation of the expected detection rates . the important fact",
    "is that the mass of a typical neutron star is @xmath129 , whereas the mass of a typical black hole is @xmath130 .",
    "the averaged mass of the observed black hole candidates in the x - ray binaries is @xmath131 .",
    "a pair of black holes is a more powerful source of gravitational waves than a pair of neutron stars , and therefore black hole binaries can be seen by a given instrument from much larger distances .",
    "when it comes to the detection rates , the lower event rate of bh+bh sources is more than compensated by their larger masses .",

    "even if this @xmath246 is produced by a single gravitational wave or a single density perturbation , it is only in a special coordinate system that it can be reduced to the combination of @xmath241 and @xmath242 or to @xmath243 , respectively . to find out what we are dealing with , we have to build invariants , that is , quantities independent of the rotation of the coordinate system .",
    "one of invariants is @xmath247,\\ ] ] another one ( see , for example , @xcite ) is @xmath248.\\ ] ] @xmath249 is always positive , wheras @xmath250 can be negative , but it always satisfies the condition @xmath251 . for a pure density perturbation , @xmath252 ; and for a pure gravitational wave , @xmath253 .",
    "calculating the invariants and the formal errors from the data set ( [ qdata ] ) we find @xmath254 as expected , the available noisy data do not allow one to prefer one of hypotheses over another .",
    "but , for sure , there is no indications whatsoever that the quadrupole anisotropy is produced by a density perturbation alone .",
    "if anything , the central values of @xmath249 and @xmath250 indicate that the contribution of gravitational waves should be substantial .",
    "hopefully , the wmap quadrupole data will be more accurate , and then this analysis should be repeated .",
    "gravitational - wave physics is a mature and at the same time a very young science . in a sense ,",
    "the relativistic gravity ( general relativity ) itself is still a young science .",
    "the enormous progress in technical developments and observational verifications of the theory is accompanied by difficult issues of its adequate description and interpretation , the necessity of bringing it to a closer contact with other branches of physics .",
    "it is rumored that the nobel recognition eluded the great astronomer e. hubble because of his reluctance to say about his discovery what the establishment wanted him to say .",
    "apparently , the scientific integrity of e. hubble allowed him to say what he believed he discovered  the nonstationarity of the system of nearby galaxies  whereas he was required to admit that he discovered the  expansion of space \" .",
    "but the  expansion of space \" is still alive and well .",
    "[ for example ,  as bizarre as it may seem , space itself is expanding  specifically , the vast regions of space between galaxies \" @xcite . ]",
    "it is regularly proposed to be measured .",
    "the logic seems to be impecable . if  space \" expands by a factor of 2 in 10 billion years , why would not the earth or an atom expand by 10@xmath114 in 1 billion years ?",
    "the gravitational - wave research is plagued in a similar fashion .",
    "it is often stated that ",
    "gravitational waves are oscillations of space - time itself \" .",
    "the next phrase seems to be logically unavoidable : ",
    "gravitational waves act tidally , stretching and squeezing any object that they pass through \" .",
    "if this phrase were correct , we would never be able to notice gravitational waves .",
    "the device measuring , say , the displacements of free mirrors in an interferometer would be  stretched and squeezed \" as well .",
    "in this situation , we can probably find comfort in the wise observation @xcite :  i agree that much of what one reads in the literature is absurd .",
    "often it is a result of bad writing , rather than bad physics .",
    "i often find that people who say silly things actually do correct calculations , but are careless in what they say about them . \"",
    "it seems to the author that , in the long perspective , the value of the gravitational wave research will be in its influence on the fundamental physics .",
    "meanwhile , let us hope that the next gravitational - wave update will be devoted to the fascinating nature of concrete astrophysical sources of gravitational waves detected by the existing instruments .",
