    "the idea of laser cooling for neutral atoms was first suggested by hnsch and schalow @xcite and independently for trapped ions by wineland and dehmelt @xcite . since light carries momentum as well as energy , scattering light on matter can result in significant changes of the vibrational energy of massive particles . over the last decades ,",
    "laser cooling techniques have been designed which allow the cooling of atoms and ions to the the micro and nanokelvin temperatures needed for quantum coherence and degeneracy @xcite .",
    "examples of which are sisyphus cooling @xcite and evaporative cooling @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus our attention on laser sideband cooling of a particle in a harmonic potential @xcite which can be used for example to transfer single ions to their motional ground state with a very high precision @xcite .",
    "the idea of laser sideband cooling of a single trapped particle is relatively straightforward .",
    "if the trapping potential of the particle is strong enough for its motion to become quantised and if the corresponding phonon frequency is much larger than the spontaneous decay rate of the excited electronic state , it becomes possible to resolve the motional sidebands with the cooling laser . as a consequence ,",
    "the excitation of the excited electronic state of the trapped particle on the red sideband is most likely accompanied by the annihilation of a phonon . when followed by the spontaneous emission of a photon , the particle returns into its electronic ground state without regaining a phonon which implies cooling .",
    "the cooling cycle only stops when the particle reaches a state with almost no phonons .",
    "the final population of excited vibrational states is in general very small and only due to highly off - resonant excitations of the ground state of the atom - phonon system .",
    "the theory of laser cooling has already been studied in great detail in the literature . for reviews on this topic",
    "see for example refs .",
    "the first theoretical discussion of laser cooling with red - detuned light based on a combination of simple classical and quantum ideas can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite by wineland and itano .",
    "lindberg and stenholm later introduced the tool for a full quantum treatment of laser cooling by deriving a master equation for spontaneously emitting atoms with atomic recoil included @xcite ( cf .",
    "also  refs .",
    "@xcite ) . an alternative but consistent analysis of the laser cooling of trapped ions in a running and in a standing wave configuration has been presented by cirac _",
    "the main result of these papers is a cooling equation of the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the mean phonon number .",
    "the @xmath3 can be interpreted as transition rates between states with different phonon numbers and relate to actual cooling and heating rates .",
    "moreover , one can show that the stationary state phonon rate @xmath4 is given by @xcite @xmath5 experimental results confirm the general dependence of this stationary state phonon number on the emission rate of the excited electronic state of the trapped particle @xmath6 and on its phonon frequency @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to analyse the cooling process of a single trapped particle in a harmonic potential with fewer approximations than previously done in the literature .",
    "for example , we avoid the adiabatic elimination of the excited atomic state , thereby obtaining an analysis of the cooling process which applies for a much wider range of rabi frequencies @xmath8 of the cooling laser . as a result",
    "we find that @xmath8 does not have to be small compared to the spontaneous decay rate @xmath6 and the laser detuning @xmath9 .",
    "for example , in the weak confinement regime with @xmath10 , the rabi frequency @xmath11 can be as large as @xmath12 and in the strong confinement regime with @xmath13 , the rabi frequency @xmath11 can be as large as @xmath14 without noticeably increasing the stationary state phonon number @xmath4 .",
    "this is an interesting observation , since the effective cooling rate @xmath15 scales as @xmath16 which increases rapidly when @xmath8 increases .",
    "our calculations are more straightforward than previous calculations , since we replace the atomic raising operator @xmath17 and the phonon annihilation operator @xmath18 by two new operators @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "these correspond to particles that are neither atoms nor phonons and commute with each other .",
    "most importantly , they provide a representation of the hamiltonian which no longer contains atomic displacement operators .",
    "instead it depends on terms like @xmath21 which take non - linear effects in the atom - phonon interaction into account @xcite . in the following we use this hamiltonian to obtain a manageable set of cooling equations which are differential equations for the time derivatives of expectation values . as in refs .",
    "@xcite , we are interested in the dynamics of the cooling process on the very slow time scale given by the cooling rate @xmath15 which scales as @xmath22 with @xmath0 .",
    "the only approximation involved in the following calculations of stationary state phonon numbers and effective cooling rates is to neglect higher order terms in the lamb - dicke parameter @xmath23 .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to establish and test a framework for the modelling of laser cooling which can be extended relatively easily to more complex cooling scenarios like cavity - mediated laser cooling @xcite and the study of possible quantum optical heating mechanisms in sonoluminescence experiments @xcite .",
    "cavity - mediated laser cooling for example has many similarities with laser cooling but due to being more complex there is more flexibility in choosing different scenarios and experimental parameters @xcite .",
    "there are six sections in this paper .",
    "section [ model ] introduces the master equation of a single laser - driven trapped particle .",
    "section [ standard ] uses this master equation to derive a closed set of 23 cooling equations .",
    "these simplify to a set of five equations in the weak confinement regime and to a single equation in the strong confinement regime , respectively . in section [ stability ]",
    "we show that the phonon coherences and the mean phonon number @xmath2 always reach their stationary state .",

    ", we consider the motion of the trapped particle as quantised and introduce the model which allows us to predict the time evolution of its mean phonon number @xmath2 .",
    "the purpose of the cooling laser is to minimise the number of phonons in the motion of the particle in the direction of the laser .",
    "cooling other vibrational modes requires additional cooling lasers .",
    "the hamiltonian of a single trapped particle inside the free radiation field and with external laser driving can be written as @xmath24 the first two terms are the free energy of the electronic states and of the quantised vibrational modes of the trapped particle .",
    "the third term describes the energy of the surrounding free radiation field .",
    "the last terms take the dipole interaction of the electronic states with the present electromagnetic fields , i.e.  the laser and the free radiation field , into account .",

    "considering this motion as quantised with the phonon annihilation operator @xmath18 from above , hence implies @xmath55 where the lamb - dicke parameter @xmath56 is a measure for the steepness of the effective trapping potential seen by the ion @xcite .",
