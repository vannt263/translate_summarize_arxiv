    "quantum searching was invented to speed up the searching process in databases .",
    "it was realized by hoyer et al@xcite and independently by me @xcite that this searching was a special case of amplitude amplification whereby the amplitude in a target state could be amplified linearly with the number of operations .",
    "this realization considerably increased the power of the algorithm , no longer was it limited to database searching but was applicable to a host of physics and computer science problems .",
    "in fact it gave a square - root speedup for almost any classical probabilistic algorithm .",
    "the idea behind this speedup was realized later on to be a two dimensional rotation through which the state - vector got driven from the source to a target state through a sequence of small rotations in the two dimensional space defined by the source and the target state .",
    "this is easily seen by considering the basic transformation :  @xmath0 say @xmath1 then if we calculate @xmath2 , by definition of the @xmath3 operations , it easily follows that    [ 0]@xmath4    note that this is true for any unitary @xmath5 it stays true if we replace @xmath6 by @xmath7 which yields :    @xmath8 substituting for @xmath7 as @xmath9 in ( [ recursion ] ) and @xmath2 from ( [ amptamp ] ) , it follows that:@xmath10    similarly by recursing multiple times , we can prove the transformation : @xmath11 to be true for large @xmath12",
    "this paper gives a new kind of amplitude amplification in which the amplitude in the target grows ; quadratically with the number of iterations . instead of @xmath13choosing the basic transformation",
    "to be @xmath14 we choose @xmath7 to be @xmath15 it follows by using the definitions of @xmath16 &  @xmath17 that @xmath18 in case @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 and @xmath22 then @xmath23unlike the recursion equation of the previous transformation which only depended on @xmath24 , this equation depends on both @xmath25 and @xmath19 and even @xmath26 so we need to investigate how @xmath25 and @xmath19 vary in successive recursions .",
    "consider @xmath27 . again assuming @xmath28 and @xmath29@xmath30",
    "note that if we denote @xmath31 , and @xmath27 by @xmath32 assuming all terms to be real and neglecting  @xmath33 on the rhs , the above equation may be written as : @xmath34    therefore @xmath27 stays close to 1 for approximately@xmath35 recursions .",
    "in i recursions , provided @xmath36 , @xmath24 rises by a factor of approximately @xmath37 therefore in @xmath38 recursions @xmath24 rises by approximately a factor of @xmath39 the number of queries is approximately @xmath40 which is @xmath41 as expected the amplification of @xmath24 is quadratic in the region when @xmath19 is approximately 1 .",
    "consider the situation when s , the starting state is an arbitrary basis state and u is the inversion about average transformation .",
    "then , assuming there to be n states to be searched , @xmath19 is @xmath42 and @xmath43 is @xmath44 then analyzing the sequence of operations for a few steps-    * @xmath45 * @xmath46 * @xmath47    looks something like the search algorithm , which is : @xmath48    however , any similarity is superficial , as we discuss in the following section , this algorithm is _ not _ a rotation of the state vector in two - dimensional hilbert space .    nevertheless , the dynamics of the algorithm are fairly simple to understand and analyze iteratively : the state just before an inversion about average is described by 3 parameters , the amplitudes in the target state , source state and that in the other states .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig1.ps    the evolution is obtained by the following equations ( a(t ) denotes the average amplitude over all states ) : @xmath49    going to the continuous limit and solving this system of differential equations gives the amplitude in the target state as @xmath50 therefore in @xmath51 iterations , the amplitude in the target state becomes unity .",
    "the number of iterations required for searching with certainty is @xmath52 times more than required by the search algorithm .",
    "the variation of the amplitude in the target state is @xmath53 in the initial stages ( when @xmath54 is close to 0 ) , the amplitude varies as @xmath55 .",
    "as expected , the rate of increase is quadratic .",
    "however , once the probability in the target state become significant ( also affecting @xmath56 , the quadratic nature of the increase is destroyed .",
    "the algorithm of this paper may be useful in applications where the basic @xmath24 that needs to be amplified is small ( in the above example where the u  transform was the inversion about average , @xmath24 was only @xmath57 - whereas in the search algorithm it is about @xmath58    it is possible that there would exist applications where a few applications of this algorithm provided the driving transform for amplitude amplification algorithms .",
    "that way , we would get the quadratic speedup plus the flexibility of the amplitude amplification algorithms .",
    "one might be tempted to conclude that the above algorithm was a variant of the search algorithm because , overall , it gave a square - root speedup ; also it consists of similar sequences of unitary transformations ( [ seq ] ) . however , that is not the case .",
    "the chief characteristic of the search algorithm and all its variants ( amplitude amplification algorithms ) was a rotation of the state vector in appropriately defined two dimensional space .",
    "the algorithm of this paper needs more than two dimensions to operate in . to see this",
    "consider the basic recursion equation ( [ recursion ] ) used to develop the algorithm : @xmath59 given large @xmath19 &  @xmath25 and @xmath60 we had argued that @xmath2 was amplified significantly in each recursion . in order to satisfy this condition needs more than two dimensions .",
    "this is because if there were only two dimensions it would follow from unitarity of @xmath6 that @xmath61=0 ( any two columns of a unitary matrix are orthogonal ) - therefore , additional dimensions are necessary .",
    "the above algorithm gives a quadratic amplification under certain conditions.the quadratic amplification offers something new beyond the search algorithm , even though it is not as universally applicable . to borrow a term from analog amplifiers",
    ": this only has a limited dynamic range - outside of this range it has to be supplemented by other more robust algorithms .    just as @xcite ( @xcite,@xcite )",
    ", this algorithm provides yet another tool in the quantum algorithm designer s toolkit . whereas , ( @xcite ) is independently useful to design quantum algorithms , the fixed point algorithms &  the algorithm of this paper may be useful in combination with  other algorithms - ( ( @xcite,@xcite ) ) to improve the robustness and the algorithm of this paper to increase the amplification in selected ranges .    as described in the _ observations _ section , the algorithm of this paper may be useful in conjunction with the standard quantum search algorithm",
    "this is somewhat similar in spirit to applications where the search algorithm is combined with a classical algorithm .",
    "one such example is the counting algorithm of @xcite where one gets round the cyclical nature of the search algorithm by making appropriately timed observations ( which is the classical algorithm ) .",
    "the counting algorithm is not usually looked at this way , but in the context of robustness versus speed , it is insightful to look upon it as a combination of classical and quantum search algorithms ,"
