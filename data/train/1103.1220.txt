    "in this ms thesis , we have followed eric gourgoulhon s lecture notes titled _ 3 + 1 formalism and bases of numerical relativity ( arxiv : gr - qc/0703035v1 _ @xcite and e. poisson s book : _ a relativist s toolkit , the mathematics of black - hole mechanics , cambridge university press , cambridge ( 2004 ) _ @xcite .    historically , the 3 + 1 approach has been put forward g. darmaois ( 1927)@xcite , a. lichnerowicz ( 1930 - 40 ) @xcite , @xcite and y. choquet - bruhat ( 1952)@xcite . during 1958 , 3 + 1 formalism started to be used to construct the hamiltonian form of general relativity by p. a. m. dirac @xcite , @xcite and later by r. arnowitt , s. deser and c. w. misner ( 1962 ) @xcite .",
    "the 3 + 1 formalism became popular in the numerical relativity community during 1970 @xcite .",
    "_ the 3 + 1 formalism is used to rewrite the einstein equation as an initial value problem and construct the hamiltonian form of the general relativity_. this method is based on the concept of the hypersurface , @xmath0 , which is independent of whether the given spacetime is a solution of the einstein equation or not . in this formalism , we consider that there is an embedding mapping @xmath1 which maps the points of a hypersurface into the corresponding points of the four - dimensional manifold @xmath2 such that @xmath2 is covered by the continuous set of hypersurfaces @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , the well - known gauss - codazzi relations and the 3 + 1 decomposition of the spacetime ricci scalar curvature are the fundamental equations of the 3 + 1 decompositions of the spacetime @xmath4 . and they play a crucial role in the 3 + 1 decompositions of the einstein equation .",
    "the gauss - codazzi relations are defined on a single hypersurface . on the other hand",
    ", the 3 + 1 decomposition of the spacetime ricci scalar is obtained from the flow of the hypersurfaces .",
    "moreover , the foliation is valid for any spacetime with a lorentzian metric so we have to restrict our selves to the globally - hyperbolic spacetimes . and",
    "the foliation kinematics of the globally - hyperbolic spacetimes allow us to construct the ricci equation whose contraction with respect to the induced 3-metric gives the last fundamental equation of the 3 + 1 formalism ( i.e the 3 + 1 expression of the spacetime scalar curvature ) @xcite .",
    "the 3 + 1 decomposition of the einstein equation is obtained by using the gauss - codazzi relations , the 3 + 1 decomposition of spacetime ricci scalar and the 3 + 1 decomposition of stress - energy tensor .",
    "basically , the four - dimensional einstein equation decomposes into three main equations which are known as : _ the dynamical einstein equation _ , _ hamiltonian constraint _ and _ momentum constraint_. the dynamical einstein equation is obtained from the full projection of the einstein equation onto the hypersurface and has 6 independent components , the hamiltonian constraint is obtained from the full projection of einstein equation along the normal vector and has 1 independent component and the momentum constraint is obtained from the mixed projection of the einstein equation and it has 3 independent components . therefore , as we expect , the total number of independent components are 10 which is exactly the number of independent components of the einstein equation in four - dimensional spacetime @xcite .    the 3 + 1 dimensional einstein system is modified to the cauchy problem ( or initial - value problem ) by rewriting it as a set of pdes ( partial differential equations ) and specifying with the help of particular choices of the lapse function n and shift vector @xmath5 .",
    "choosing a scalar field @xmath6 , a vector field @xmath5 and a spatial coordinate system @xmath7 on an initial hypersurface allows us to define a unique coordinate system @xmath8 within a neighborhood of @xmath9 such that @xmath10 corresponds @xmath0 .",
    "that is , n and @xmath5 are depend on the coordinate systems . and also , the lapse function n at each point of @xmath9 leads us to define a unique vector * m*(@xmath11 n * n * ) which is used to construct the neighboring hypersurface @xmath12 by lie dragging each point of @xmath9 along * m*. therefore , the 3 + 1 dimensional einstein system can be turned into as a pdes system by using tensor components which are expanded with respect to the coordinates @xmath13 adapted to the foliation .",
    "the pdes form of the 3 + 1 dimensional einstein system contains only tensor fields of @xmath0 and their time derivatives which implies that they can be taken as a _ time evolving tensor fields on a given _ @xmath0 .",
    "the pdes form of the 3 + 1 dimensional einstein system is a system of second - order , non - linear pdes for unknown ( @xmath14 ) when the matter source terms ( @xmath15 ) are given . here",
    "@xmath16 is the metric of the hypersurface , @xmath17 is the extrinsic curvature , @xmath18 is the energy density , @xmath19 is the momentum density and @xmath20 is the stress tensor .",
    "the crucial point is that the pdes form of the 3 + 1 einstein system contains neither the time derivative of n nor of @xmath5 .",
    "this means that _ they are not dynamical variables _ rather they are just quantities associated with the coordinates @xmath13 ( that is , lagrange multipliers ) .",
    "therefore , pdes form of the 3 + 1 einstein system can be converted into the initial value problem by choosing particular n and @xmath5 @xcite , @xcite .    beside the orthogonal decomposition that is used for 3 + 1 formalism , the _ conformal decomposition _",
    "is also used to define the flow of the hypersurfaces by continuously mapping an initial well - defined conformal background metric @xmath21 into the induced 3-metric of @xmath0 .",
    "lichnerowicz @xcite proposed that by mean of the particular conformal decomposition of the extrinsic curvature , one can arrange the constraint equations which allows us to define initial data for the cauchy problem .",
    "in addition to this , york has shown that the conformal decompositions can be used for the time evolution @xcite .",
    "that s , he has proved that _ the two degrees of freedom of the gravitational field are carried by the conformal equivalence classes of the induced 3-metric _ @xcite . the weyl tensor is used to check whether a given spacetime , whose dimension is greater than 3 , is conformally flat or not.and it disappears for lower - dimensional manifolds . in this case , the cotton - york tensor \\{@xcite , @xcite , @xcite } , @xmath22 , does _ the same task of the weyl tensor in higher dimensional spacetime_. furthermore , the cotton - york @xcite , @xcite , @xcite tensor of weight @xmath23 , @xmath24 , is _",
    "conformally invariant_.    the hamiltonian model approaches a physical state at a _ certain time _ and gives the evolution of the state as time varies .",
    "this model is being transformed into the gravitational theory as a state on _ a particular spacelike hypersurface _",
    "@xcite , @xcite .",
    "now , the gravitational theory is a covariant theory and locally has lorentz symmetry . in order to write the einstein equations into the hamiltonian form",
    ", people started to give up the main covariance property of the gravitational theory by choosing a family of particular coordinate systems such that  @xmath25 constant  corresponds a spacelike hypersurface .",
    "instead of the set ( @xmath14 ) in the pdes form of 3 + 1 einstein system , arnowitt , deser and misner have proposed the adm formalism of the general relativity in which _ conjugate momentum of the induced three - metric @xmath16 _ , @xmath26 , is used . in the adm formalism @xcite , @xmath27 and @xmath16 are the dynamical variables and the lapse function n and the shift vector @xmath5 are taken as lagrange multipliers @xcite . in the chapter 6 , we will see this in detail @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the action for the general relativity ( when the boundary term is different than zero ) contains einstein - hilbert part and matter part .",
    "the infinitesimal four - dimensional volume element is taken as the union of two spacelike hypersurfaces @xmath28 , @xmath29 which are at the upper and lower boundaries and a timelike hypersurface @xmath30 between @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "now , 3 + 1 decomposition of @xmath2 and 2 + 1 decomposition of the timelike hypersurface with proper choice of vectors lead us to the conserved quantities of the adm mass , adm linear momentum and adm angular ( by using rotational killing vectors ) of a given hypersurface . however , due to the fact that global quantities of mass , linear momentum and angular momentum are defined only for _ asymptotically flat spacetimes _ , the adm formulas are valid just for _ the spacetimes which asymptotically converge to well - defined spacetimes such as minkowski spacetime _",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "finally , r. bartnik and p. tod introduce @xcite the conditions on the intrinsic quantities of the @xmath0 .",
    "they ensure whether the @xmath0 is a hypersurface of a spacetime which is a solution of the four - dimensional static vacuum field ( with @xmath31 ) or not .",
    "in addition to @xcite , we introduce the equations ( [ dkt3 ] ) , ( [ dkt4 ] ) ( for @xmath32 case ) and ( [ dkt1 ] ) , ( [ dkt2 ] ) ( for @xmath33 case ) .",
    "these equations can be used to find which solutions of the gradient cotton ( conformal ) soliton @xcite are also the solutions of the static vacuum fields equations .",
    "however , we have not also been able to solve the constraint equations and have not found explicit metric .",
    "moreover , we think that our method can be extended to the ricci soliton @xcite and topologically massive gravity ( tmg ) @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "since 3 + 1 decomposition of the spacetime is constructed by slicing the spacetime with a continuous set of the hypersurfaces , @xmath3 , we will deal with the geometrical fundamentals of the hypersurface .",
    "the geometrical results that we will obtain in this chapter are fully independent of whether the given spacetime is a solution of the einstein equation or not .",
    "the only constraint is that the spacetime must have lorentzian metric @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we assume a real , smooth @xmath34 four - dimensional manifold @xmath2 which endowed a lorentzian metric of signature @xmath35 and a connection @xmath36 .",
    "in general , no one can define a global vector space on manifolds .",
    "therefore , it is considered that at each point of the manifolds there is a space of vectors @xmath37 ( titled as _",
    "tangent space at the point p _ ) and corresponding space of linear forms @xmath38 ( titled as _ dual space _ or _ cotangent space at the point p _ ) .",
    "furthermore , we suppose that all the greek letters @xmath39 run in @xmath40 are free indices , @xmath41 are dummy indices and all latin letters @xmath42 run in @xmath43 and @xmath44 run in @xmath45 .    since the @xmath37 and @xmath38 are vector spaces , we consider that there is a set of basis @xmath46 which spans @xmath37 and the associated dual set of basis @xmath47 which spans @xmath38 such that @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , any tensor field @xmath49 of type @xmath50 can be expanded with respect to these bases as @xmath51 here @xmath52 are the related components of @xmath49 relative to the bases @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "a tensor field * t * with rank @xmath53 turns into another tensor field @xmath54 with the rank @xmath55 when the covariant derivative acts on it .",
    "therefore , the expansion of @xmath56 in these bases is @xmath57 the contraction of covariant derivative of the tensor field @xmath49 with an arbitrary vector field * u * gives us the _ covariant derivative of @xmath49 along the vector field _ * u * which _ does not change the rank of tensor fields _",
    "@xmath58 where @xmath59 are the components of @xmath60 with respect to @xmath46 and @xmath47 .      in general ,",
    "we do not know how to relate the elements of @xmath61 ( or of @xmath38 ) .",
    "the concept of metric is introduced to do this task .",
    "now , _ the scalar product _ of two vectors is taken place by mean of the related metric * g * of the manifold @xmath2",
    "@xmath62 @xmath63 here the metric * g * is taken as if it has two slots for inputting vectors .",
    "alternatively , the same job is done by bracket notation : @xmath64 , @xmath65 as we see in equation ( [ exp_tens ] ) , ",
    "@xmath66  are the components of the 2-form @xmath67 relative to the bases @xmath68 of @xmath69 .",
    "then , _ the directional covariant derivative of a 1-form @xmath70 along a vector field @xmath71,@xmath72 , _ is a 1-form @xmath73(u^\\mu e_\\nu ) \\\\ & = u^\\mu \\nabla_\\gamma w_\\beta e^\\beta e^\\gamma(e_\\mu ) \\\\   & = u^\\mu \\nabla_\\gamma w_\\beta e^\\beta \\delta^\\gamma{_\\mu } \\\\ & = u^\\mu \\nabla_\\mu w_\\beta e^\\beta \\ , .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the directional derivative , @xmath72 , is a 1-form , we use the bracket notation to get a scalar from it : @xmath74 , @xmath75 any element of @xmath61 ( or @xmath38 ) can be mapped into @xmath38 ( or @xmath61 ) by mean of the 2-form * g*. that s , the metric * g * induces an isometry between @xmath61 and @xmath38 .",
    "some of crucial properties of this isometry are    1 .",
    "the dual of any vector * u * ( @xmath76 ) is a unique linear form of @xmath38 and denoted by @xmath77 such that the scalar product is defined as @xmath78 2 .",
    "the dual of any linear form @xmath70 ( @xmath79 ) , @xmath80 , is a unique vector * w * @xmath76 such that @xmath81 3 .",

    "@xmath84 is induced from * t * such that @xmath85 and it satisfies @xmath86 as we see in the equation ( [ exp - ten ] ) and because the endomorphism @xmath84 is a 1-form , @xmath87 are the components of @xmath84 relative to @xmath47 .      according to gravity , the matter curves the geometry and the geometry determines the motion of the matter .",
    "the rank @xmath88 riemann curvature tensor measures how much the spacetime is curved .",
    "basically , it is a map which sends a 1-form and 3 vectors into the real , smooth space of scalar fields",

    "\\label{riem}\\ ] ] the riemann tensor @xmath92 is assumed to be machine which has 1 slot for 1-form and 3 slots for vectors .",
    "the relation ( [ riem ] ) is nothing but a tensor field on @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath93 is the components of @xmath92 with respect to a proper set of basis @xmath47 and @xmath46 of @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "now , the crucial properties of @xmath92 are    1 .",
    "@xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) is anti - symmetric between the @xmath98 two terms @xmath99 and @xmath5 and between the @xmath100 two terms @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",

    "one - times contraction of @xmath105 , i.e. @xmath106 , leads us to a symmetric , bilinear - form ricci tensor @xmath92 .",
    "the @xmath92 is considered to be a machine that has 2 slots for vectors @xmath107 also , the trace of the ricci tensor relative to the dual of @xmath108 results in the spacetime scalar curvature @xmath109 .",
    "the _ traceless _ part of the spacetime riemann tensor titled as * weyl tensor * , @xmath110 which gives _ * whether a given spacetime is conformally flat or not * _ is obtained by subtracting all the _ trace _ part ( i.e. the ricci tensor ) and the _ trace - trace _ part ( i.e. the ricci scalar @xmath111 ) of the spacetime riemann curvature tensor from itself @xmath112 we need to emphasize that _ the weyl tensor , @xmath110 , vanishes for spacetime whose dimension is lower than 4 .",
    "thus , in the lower dimensional geometry the spacetime riemann tensor can be written in terms of the ricci tensor , the metric and the scalar curvature tensor . _      as we see in the figure ( [ hyp_embed ] ) , the set of points , @xmath113 , at which the scalar field is constant corresponds a hypersurface @xmath114 of the four - dimensional manifold @xmath2 which is an image of a three - dimensional manifold @xmath115 under the homeomorphism @xmath1 .",
    "since the three - dimensional manifold @xmath115 is something like to be embedded into the four - dimensional manifold @xmath2 , we say that the mapping @xmath1 is an embedding mapping @xmath116 furthermore , ",
    "_ one - to - one character of the embedding mapping @xmath1 ensures that the hypersurfaces do not intersect _  .     into @xmath2,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the embedding mapping @xmath1 induces two well - known mappings of _ the push - forward mapping _ , @xmath117 , and _ the pull - back mapping _ , @xmath118 .",

    "especially , the pull - back of the 2-form spacetime metric * g * takes a great attention .",
    "the pull - back of * g * is called the induced metric , @xmath101 , of the hypersurface , @xmath0 and known as * the first fundamental form of * @xmath0 @xmath127 moreover , the scalar product between any two vectors of the tangent space of the hypersurface is same either by using * g * or @xmath101 : @xmath128 , @xmath129      we consider there is a scalar field @xmath130 on @xmath2 such that each  @xmath130 = constant  corresponds the hypersurface @xmath0 of @xmath2 and the vector @xmath131 is normal to @xmath114 .",
    "then , the dual of the vector @xmath131 is the gradient 1-form @xmath132 such that the relation between them is @xmath133 and @xmath134 , the scalar product vanishes @xmath135 furthermore , the type of the normal vector @xmath131 is determined by the type of the hypersurface @xmath114 : that s , if the signature of induced metric @xmath101 of @xmath114 is ( + , + , + ) then @xmath114 is _ spacelike _ and the corresponding normal vector @xmath131 is _ timelike _ , contrary , if the signature of induced is ( -,+,+ ) then @xmath114 is _ timelike _ and the corresponding normal vector @xmath131 is _ spacelike _ and , finally , if the induced metric is degenerate , i.e. has signature of ( 0,+,+ ) then either @xmath0 or @xmath131 are _ null_.    although @xmath131 is a unique normal vector to @xmath0 , it is not a unit normal vector .",
    "therefore , in the not - null case , we normalize it to get a unit normal vector of * n * @xmath136 where the positive sign ( + ) is used for a timelike hypersurface and the negative sign ( - ) is used for a spacelike hypersurface .",
    "thus , the norm of the unit normal vector is @xmath137      for the not - null case , one can always propose a _",
    "unique levi - civita connection @xmath138 _ which is still torsion - free and metric compatible on a hypersurface @xmath114 .",
    "moreover , the intrinsic covariant derivative @xmath138 is defined by using the induced metric @xmath101 .",
    "now , as we see in the relation ( [ riem ] ) , the riemann curvature tensor measures the curvature by using the spacetime connection @xmath36 .",
    "however , in order to measure the curvature of the hypersurface @xmath114 ( i.e. _ the intrinsic curvature of the @xmath114 _ ) , we replace the spacetime connection @xmath36 with the intrinsic connection @xmath138 .",
