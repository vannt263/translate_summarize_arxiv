    "the na49 experiment is unique in measuring @xmath3 and @xmath4 production over the full range of hadronic interactions , from @xmath0 collisions via centrality controlled @xmath5 to central @xmath6 reactions .",
    "this offers interesting possibilities of comparison , in particular concerning the nuclear enhancement factors in @xmath1 and @xmath2 collisions .",
    "the extraction of these factors is straightforward for the symmetric @xmath0 and @xmath6 interactions , however the interpretation of central rapidity yields from @xmath1 collision poses certain problems of normalization or , rather , separation of projectile and target contributions .",
    "in addition , the effects of projectile and target isospin and of net baryon stopping have to be properly addressed .",
    "invoking the absence of charge and flavor exchange at sps energies one may postulate hadronic factorization in the sense of splitting particle production into two independent components , one from the target and one from the projectile , fig.[fig : two - comp ] .",
    ", @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 reactions .",
    "spectra for @xmath10 , @xmath11 are splitted to target and projectile component.,width=415 ]    this picture has been verified @xcite for net proton production both for @xmath0 and @xmath5 interactions , using pion beams .",
    "it has been shown that particle densities in @xmath5 collisions at central rapidity are built up from a  target part which is proportional to the number of projectile collisions , @xmath12 , and a  projectile part which carries the imprint of the hadron which has undergone @xmath12 collisions .",
    "the presence of nuclear enhancement in @xmath1 collisions can accordingly be analyzed along two different lines : either this enhancement @xmath13 is equally distributed to target and projectile components ( `` wounded nucleon '' model ) , @xmath14\\cdot\\left(\\frac{{\\mathrm{d}}n}{{\\mathrm{d}}x_f}\\right)^{p+p}_{x_f=0 } \\label{eq : pa - wound}\\ ] ] or it is fully credited to the projectile contribution , @xmath15\\cdot\\left(\\frac{{\\mathrm{d}}n}{{\\mathrm{d}}x_f}\\right)^{p+p}_{x_f=0 } \\label{eq : pa}\\ ] ] the latter possibility has been shown to be valid by na49 at least for net protons @xcite .",
    "alpha is an isospin factor as discussed below .",
    "and @xmath4 at midrapidity calculated with two different assumptions ( see text ) .",
    "the stars indicate enhancement factors in @xmath1 reactions calculated from equation [ eq : pa - wound],title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]   and @xmath4 at midrapidity calculated with two different assumptions ( see text ) .",
    "the stars indicate enhancement factors in @xmath1 reactions calculated from equation [ eq : pa - wound],title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]     and @xmath4 at midrapidity calculated from equation [ eq : pa].,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]   and @xmath4 at midrapidity calculated from equation [ eq : pa].,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    using the measured @xmath16 and @xmath17 cross sections @xcite the extracted enhancement factors turn out to be largely different following the two prescriptions , as shown in fig.[fig : enhancement ] for @xmath18 .",
    "clearly , the projectile enhancement obtained from method ( [ eq : pa ] ) in @xmath1 collisions is very similar to the one seen in @xmath6 reactions whereas method ( [ eq : pa - wound ] ) , due to the overriding target contribution , yields little or no overall enhancement in @xmath1 collisions .",
    "a noteworthy feature of fig.[fig : enhancement ] is the sizeable difference in enhancement between @xmath3 and @xmath4 which amounts to about a factor of two .",
    "since heavy nuclei contain about @xmath19 neutrons , eventual differences in particle yields between neutron and proton fragmentation have to be carefully taken into account .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that for anti - protons for example there is a @xmath20 yield difference between neutron and proton induced elementary interactions .",
    "this difference has been traced to an important component of asymmetric baryon pair production ( e.g. @xmath21 or @xmath22 ) which strongly depends on projectile isospin . in the absence of measurements of @xmath16 production from neutrons",
    ", it seems reasonable to assume that similar pair production mechanisms hold for @xmath23 production .",
    "given the charge structure of the isospin triplet of @xmath23 states , @xmath24 a decrease in @xmath4 and an increase of @xmath3 production is to be expected when switching from proton to neutron projectiles .",
    "taking account of the @xmath25 mixture of protons and neutrons in @xmath26 nuclei and assuming the same asymmetry factor as measured for @xmath27 baryons this results in an effective isospin factor @xmath28 for @xmath3 and @xmath29 for @xmath4 .",
    "the isospin corrected enhancement factors ( see equation [ eq : pa ] ) are shown in fig.[fig : enhancement - iso ] .",
    "apparently the similarity between @xmath1 and @xmath6 interactions is preserved and the large asymmetry between @xmath3 and @xmath4 enhancements , fig.[fig : enhancement ] , is strongly reduced .",
    "the transfer of net baryon number from forward to central region in multiple collision processes ( `` stopping '' ) may play an important role in the interpretation of central baryon densities .",
    "the net proton yield from the projectile e.g. increases by a factor of about @xmath30 at central rapidity when comparing @xmath0 and central @xmath5 interactions @xcite ( see fig . [",
    "fig : netprot ] ) . for @xmath3 production",
    ", corresponding studies would imply the measurement of complete @xmath31 distributions in pion and proton induced collisions .",
    "such measurements are not available .",
    "nevertheless one may conjecture that  given the steeper @xmath31 dependence of @xmath3 as compared to @xmath32  the `` enhancement '' of net @xmath3 at @xmath33 in multiple collision processes should be smaller .",
    "the experimental situation concerning net @xmath3 production is given in fig.[fig : netxi ] which shows the enhancement factors as function of @xmath12 .",
    "one may conclude that  compared to @xmath4  the relative increase is of order @xmath34 which might well originate from net @xmath3 stopping ."
