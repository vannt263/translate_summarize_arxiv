    "after the pioneering work by michaud ( @xcite ) particle diffusion in stellar envelopes and atmospheres is considered as the main process responsible for the atmospheric abundance anomalies in the peculiar stars of the upper main sequence .",
    "detailed diffusion calculations performed for a set of chemical elements in the atmospheres of magnetic peculiar stars predicted an existence of abundance stratification . for a small number of elements , including ca ,",
    "an effect of the stratified element distribution on the spectral line profiles was demonstrated in early studies ( borsenberger at al .",
    "@xcite ) , but the absence of high - resolution , high signal - to - noise spectroscopic observations did not allow the direct comparison between the observations and diffusion calculations .",
    "this step was carried out by babel ( @xcite ) , who calculated the ca abundance distribution in the atmosphere of magnetic star 53 cam and showed that the unusual shape of ca  k line  a sharp transition between the wide wings and extremely narrow core  is a result of a step - like ca distribution with abundance decrease at @xmath0 .",
    "following babel , the step - function approximation of the abundance distribution was commonly employed in many stratification studies based on the observed profiles of spectral lines ( wade et al .",

    "if the overall distribution of ca abundance in the atmospheres of ap stars follows the predictions of the radiatively driven diffusion , our results on the isotopic separation favour the light - induced drift ( lid ) as the main process responsible for this separation . indeed , according to atutov & shalagin ( @xcite ) lid arises when the radiation field is anisotropic inside the line profile .",
    "such an anisotropy takes place for a line of the trace isotopes , @xmath3ca , @xmath4ca for instance , in the solar - matter mixture , which is sitting in the wing of a strong line of the main isotope @xmath6ca , and the main isotope should induce the drift velocity for other isotopes .",
    "if we have a trace isotope s line in the red wing of the main isotope s line , then the drift velocity is directed from towards the upper atmosphere and the trace isotopes are pushed upwards .",
    "this is the case for the ca isotopic structure .",
    "zeeman splitting changes the line shape and decreases the flux anisotropy for a trace isotope s line .",
    "when magnetic field becomes strong enough , @xmath24 kg , then the flux anisotropy disappears and the isotopic separation is ceasing .",
    "therefore , the observed ca isotopic anomaly in magnetic stars may be qualitatively explained by the combined action of the radiatively - driven diffusion and light - induced drift .",
