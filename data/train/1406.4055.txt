    "throughout the years many studies on galactic star formation have been conducted ( e.g. kennicutt & evans 2009 ; mckee & ostriker 2007 ; zinnecker & yorke 2007 ) .",
    "it has been observed and theorized that within giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) there are clumps and small cores .",
    "this resulted in the idea that gmcs are hierarchical in nature with substructures spanning a large range of sizes .",
    "clumps are dense regions with masses @xmath210@xmath3 - 10@xmath4m@xmath5 and sizes of a few parsec , whereas cores are smaller ( @xmath20.1pc ) and denser .",
    "it is here where individual star formation occurs ( williams et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the physical processes that determine how molecular clouds fragment , form clumps / cores and then stars depends strongly on the past history of star formation .",
    "this occurs through both recent radiative and mechanical feedback from massive stars and , on longer term , through enhanced cooling due to the buildup of metals .",
    "radiative and mechanical energy input from stellar populations can alter subsequent star formation over a large part of a galaxy and is hence relevant to the evolution of galaxies .",
    "much of our knowledge of star formation on galaxy wide scales is based on scaling laws and other parametric descriptions of star formation ( e.g. kennicutt 2012 ) . but to understand the overall evolution of star formation in galaxies we need to watch the feedback processes at work on giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) scales . by doing this",
    "we can begin to answer how strong feedback environments change the properties of the substructure in gmcs .",
    "applying the theory of galactic star formation to other galaxies has been a challenging process due to the lack of resolution with current instruments .",
    "however , only the nearest galaxies allow us to resolve gmcs and their substructures .",
    "the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , is one of the closest galaxy ( d@xmath2 50kpc ) and is close enough that current instruments can resolve the sub - structure of its gmcs to @xmath61pc .",
    "molecular gas is seen across the disk of the lmc , with previous studies revealing a dominant ridge of bright co emission extending @xmath2 2kpc south of 30 doradus , the most extreme star forming region in the local group ( e.g. columbia 1.2 m millimeter wave telescope , cohen et al .",

    "the @xmath9co is mostly associated with clumps and small pillars of creation. this makes 30dor-10 a perfect target to study extragalactic gmc dense gas properties toward a sub - solar metallicity environment under the influence of an intense starburst .",

    "we detect 13 clumps in hco@xmath0(1 - 0 ) , the four brightest of which are also detected in hcn(1 - 0 ) and are associated with previously identified ysos . properties of individual clumps are determined using cprops ( see section 3.1 ) and can be found in table 1 .",

    "we use hco@xmath0 as the primary clump tracer , since hcn is much weaker . to identify hco@xmath0 clumps in the atca data we used the cprops procedure presented by rosolowsky & leroy ( 2006 ) ( r06 ) .",
    "we follow the method of wong et al .",
    "( 2011 ) hereafter w11 and s12 , respectively to facilitate direct comparison with these studies .",
    "we briefly review the basic properties of the algorithm here .",
    "cprops uses a dilated mask technique to isolate clump regions of significant emission within spectral line cubes .",
    "clump regions of significant emission in the atca data are identified by finding volume pixels ( `` voxels '' ) with emission greater than a 3@xmath22 threshold .",
    "cprops is run on position - position - velocity data cubes where the cloud is continuous and bordered by an isosurface of brightness temperature , t@xmath23 .",
    "clump regions are determined when the pixel temperature in the cloud is @xmath21t@xmath23 and that the pixels outside the cloud have t@xmath20t@xmath23 .    once the clump regions are determined , we apply various criteria to estimate radii , line widths and other parameters , as follows .",
    "we require that each region has an area larger than two beam sizes and a velocity width of more than a single channel .",
    "also , the intensity contrast between the peak and the edge of the region must be greater than a factor of two . if it meets the above criteria then the cloud can be decomposed , otherwise it is considered noise . local maxima",
    "are then determined by identifying the elements in the data cube that are larger than their neighbors .",
    "once the local maxima are found then these are labeled as a clump and the parameters are then extracted for each clump as described in r06 .",
    "the quoted radius is determined by the geometric mean of the second spatial moments along the minor and major axis .",
    "also , any flux detected below the threshold is assumed to be properly modeled by the extrapolation algorithm .",
    "the clump radius is determined by assuming a brightness profile and distance .",
    "if the extrapolated clump size is smaller than the synthesized beam , it can not be deconvolved .",
    "marginally resolved clumps suffer from substantial radii uncertainties ( s12 ) .",
    "following , s12 , we derive the same clump properties i.e linewidth ( @xmath24 ) , virial mass ( m@xmath25 ) , lte mass ( m@xmath26 ) , and radius .",
    "we compare our values to what s12 obtained for the other gmcs in the lmc in table 2 .",
    "the velocity dispersions are found in the same way as the radii are , except they are extrapolated to what would be measured in zero - noise observations and then deconvolved from the channel width .",
    "assuming gaussian line profiles , the linewidth is determined from the full - width at half maximum as in s12 .",
    "the flux is determined in a similar manner but by using the zeroth moment .",
    "the hco@xmath0 luminosity is determined from the integrated flux scaled by the square of the distance ( w11 ) :    @xmath27 = d^{2 } \\displaystyle \\sum_{\\rm i } t_{\\rm i}\\delta v,\\ ] ]    where @xmath28 = @xmath29 is the volume of the voxel , t@xmath30 denotes brightness temperatures of individual voxels within the region , d is the distance to the lmc in parsec .",

    "this assumes a cloud with a radial density profile of @xmath33 .",
    "virial masses are shown in table 1 along with the h@xmath34 gas mass traced by hco@xmath0 under lte conditions , which is determined by following equation ( 9 ) from barnes ( 2011 ) :    @xmath35    where n@xmath36 is the column density determined by assuming optically thin emission and lte , shown in equation ( 4 ) , x@xmath36 is the hco@xmath0 abundance relative to h@xmath1 , m@xmath37 is the mass of molecular hydrogen , and r is the radius of the individual clumps in pc .",
    "@xmath38    where t@xmath39 is the excitation temperature .",
    "the hco@xmath0 column density is derived with molecular parameters from the splatalogue database .",
    "an excitation temperature ( t@xmath40 ) of 30k is adopted which is typical for massive clumps observed in dust continuum ( e.g. fandez et al .",
    "2004 ; beltrn et al .",
    "2006 ) and a hco@xmath0 abundance relative to h@xmath1 of x@xmath41 is assumed ( barnes et al .",
    "if the hco@xmath0 abundance relative to h@xmath1 is increased , the h@xmath1 gas mass traced by hco@xmath0 will decrease by a corresponding factor . on the other hand ,",
    "an increase in the excitation temperature to t@xmath42 50k will increase the mass by a factor of two .",
    "all clump parameters discussed above are found in table 1 .",
    "atca observations similar to ours were performed on the star forming regions n159 , n105a , n44 , and n113 by s12 , who detected individual clumps with the same dense gas tracers hco@xmath0(1 - 0 ) and hcn(1 - 0 ) .",
    "s12 used the same compact antenna array configuration of the atca , cabb correlator settings which result in a very similar spatial and spectral resolution and sensitivity compared to our observations .",
    "compared to these gmcs , 30doradus exhibits a much higher star formation rate ( sfr ) , more intense and extended uv flux , and is forming a super - star cluster .",
    "n159 is located south of 30dor-10 along the molecular ridge ( pineda et al .",
    "2009 , 2012 ) and has a high local radiation field due to individual star forming regions .",
    "n113 , n105a and n44 have progressively weaker interstellar radiation field , respectively .",
    "the individual gmc properties are recorded in table 2 .    in the following sub - sections we describe both the clump properties of 30 dor-10 and how they compare to the other lmc gmcs .",
    "we investigate dense - gas fraction , peak temperature - linewidth , rms centroid velocity - co linewidth , total co mass to total hco@xmath0 mass , and hcn / hco@xmath0 line ratio relations as shown in figure 3 .",
    "since cprops only obtained deconvolved radii for four of the 13 clumps , the size - linewidth and virial mass - linewidth could not be reliably determined for the entire sample .",
    "we compare the h@xmath1 mass traced by hco@xmath0 of all the clumps in each star forming region ( n159 , n113 , n105a and n44 ) to the molecular gas masses estimated from the gmcs co luminosities from magma data .",
    "the magma co data ( figure 2 ) covers our entire observed region unlike the alma map and we therefore use magma for calculations of the bulk properties of the entire gmc .",
    "m@xmath43 is calculated from w11 equation ( 2 ) :    @xmath44=4.4\\frac{x_{\\rm co}}{2.2\\times 10^{20}cm^{-2}(\\rm k\\,km\\,s^{-1 } ) } l_{\\rm co},\\ ] ]    where the galactic co - to - h@xmath1 conversion factor    @xmath45    is adopted ( strong et al .",

    "@xmath46 is the co luminosity and values are shown in table 2 for each cloud .",
    "@xmath46 comes from the magma co data which is measured directly from the integrated intensity map .",
    "the co allows us to examine how total molecular gas compares to the dense gas in each individual gmc . the dense gas fraction for 30dor-10 ( as measured by hco@xmath0(1 - 0)/co(1 - 0 ) ) is quite similar to the other gmcs in the lmc .",
    "30dor-10 s dense gas fraction is @xmath21/12 whereas the other mapped gmcs in the lmc have a dense gas fraction @xmath2 1/10 .",
    "each clump s virial mass and lte molecular mass , traced by hco@xmath0 , is found in table 1 .",
    "if the lmc clumps are composed entirely of dense gas and are in gravitational equilibrium then we would expect m@xmath25/m@xmath26 @xmath2 1 .",
    "the spatially resolved clumps in 30dor-10 , however , exhibit a ratio of m@xmath25/@xmath47 @xmath26 .",
    "such a high ratio may be attributed to several possibilities , including 1 ) the adopted t@xmath40 is underestimated , 2 ) the hco@xmath0 abundance of x@xmath48 10@xmath49 could be overestimated , 3 ) the dense gas traced by hco@xmath0 accounts for less of the total clump mass , or 4 ) that the virial mass estimate is incorrect and clumps are slightly super - virial . on the other hand ,",
    "compared to 30dor-10 the other gmcs also have elevated @xmath50m@xmath25/@xmath51 , but by a smaller amount ( a factor of three ) .",
    "the lte mass determined is dependent on the chosen t@xmath40 and hco@xmath0 abundance and so is likely the largest source of uncertainty .",
    "therefore we consider options 1 ) and 2 ) the most likely cause of the overall difference between m@xmath25 and m@xmath26 in the lmc .",
    "however the larger discrepancy between m@xmath25 and m@xmath26 in 30 dor-10 suggests that some extra reason is needed to explain the factor of three difference . given 30 dor-10 s more intense uv radiation field and dynamical impact of star formation , both higher gas excitation and clumps being super - virial likely are the causes of the increase ( see section 3.2.3 ) .",
    "figure 3c , displays the rms of the velocity centroids of the individual dense clumps versus the co linewidth of the parent gmcs and provides an indication of how the dense clumps are moving relative to the more diffuse molecular material of the whole gmc . within the errors the dense clumps in 30 dor-10",
    "fully sample the gmc s co velocity distribution and so the dense gas is not dynamically segregated from the less dense gas .    for a given brightness ,",
    "the clumps in 30dor-10 have a larger line width relative to the clumps in the other four gmcs ( figure 4 ) .",
    "the clumps in 30dor-10 lie at the bottom of the distribution having a weaker temperature and broader linewidths .",
    "the clump line widths of the rest of the four gmcs exhibit similar behavior with respect to each other . a weak trend for increasing clump brightness with line width in 30 dor-10 is also observed .",
    "evidently 30dor-10 is significantly more turbulent than the other gmcs .",
    "the l(hcn)/l(hco@xmath0 ) line ratio relates the two commonly used dense gas tracers .",
    "figure ( 3d ) shows the line luminosity ratio determined from cprops for comparison between these five gmcs in the lmc .",
    "the gmcs are significantly brighter in hco@xmath0(1 - 0 ) than hcn(1 - 0 ) , with typical line ratios l(hcn)/l(hco@xmath0)@xmath2 0.20 for the gmcs with m@xmath2110@xmath4m@xmath5 .",
    "30dor-10 has a similar line ratio as the other gmcs .",
    "we compare our atca hco@xmath0 dense gas clumps to the alma co data , to investigate the physical properties of 30dor-10 .",
    "compared to the alma clump decomposition , we detect 7 hco@xmath0 clumps over the mutually observed field of view ( fov ) while the alma data resolve 103 co sub - clumps . comparing the morphology of co to that of hco@xmath0",
    "we observe that the two are very similar in structure . over the alma field",
    ", hco@xmath0 is detected from all prominent co clumps and the brightest co clumps tend to be the brightest co clumps .",
    "the only exception is clump 10 , which is brighter in hco@xmath0 .",
    "however the integrated intensity map of @xmath9co shows more diffuse , continuous emission than what we see in the hco@xmath0 data ( figure 5 ) .",
    "the virial masses of the detected clumps in the alma and atca data are both @xmath210@xmath4 , providing a good indication of the amount of mass that is gravitationally bound in the associated clumps . on a clump by clump basis the ratio of @xmath9co",
    "/ hco@xmath0 is nearly constant for the filament being around @xmath2 12 - 14.5 .",
    "only clump 3 , which is one of farthest from r136 covered in the alma field , has a significantly higher ratio ( @xmath230 ) .",
    "the @xmath9co / hcn ratios are much higher across the whole gmc ( @xmath260 - 140 for the filament , up to  300 for clump 3 ) , consistent with the low hcn / hco@xmath0 ratio discussed in section 3.2.4 .",
    "clearly from these ratios the filament is the densest part of the cloud .",
    "the clump by clump ratios of 12 - 14.5 is very similar to what we see with the @xmath9co / hco@xmath0 magma data ( section 3.2.1 ) , giving further evidence that the large scale measurements are being dominated by clump / filament properties and not by a diffuse co medium ( see section 3.2.3 ) .",
    "the hco@xmath0 velocity profile of the linear feature can be determined by taking a position - velocity slice along its structure ( figure 6 ) .",
    "the position - velocity diagram shows almost no change in velocity , hence the clumps are either moving uniformly along the structure with the same speed and direction or its in the plane of the sky .    the dense gas in 30dor-10 may potentially be a portion of a filament extending outward from the star cluster , r136 .",
    "a tight connection between filaments and star formation in galactic dense cores has been revealed by the herschel gould belt survey ( andr et al .",
    "this survey supports an emerging picture of star formation , in which thin , long ( @xmath21pc scales ) filaments form first a molecular cloud and then the densest part of the filaments fragment into protostellar cores via gravitational instability ( inutska et al . 1997 ) .    for non - star forming regions , like polaris , all filaments have subcritical mass per unit length .",
    "this gives an explanation for the extinction threshold for the formation of prestellar cores of av @xmath2 7 observed in aquila and polaris .",
    "andr et al .",
    "( 2010 ) were able to determine that the extinction threshold corresponds to the threshold above which interstellar filaments are gravitationally unstable and can collapse to form stars .",
    "they found that @xmath21 60% of the bound prestellar cores and class 0 protostars in aquila are concentrated in gravitationally unstable filaments where the mass per unit length exceeds the critical mass per unit length ( eqn .",
    "6 ) required for hydrostatic equilibrium .    while 30dor-10 is significantly more distant than the molecular clouds studied by andr et al . ( 2010 ) , the structure of the bulk of hco@xmath0 emission in 30dor-10 bears a resemblance to a filament ( figures 1 and 2 ) .",
    "this structure has a y - shaped morphology , which could be one bifurcated filament or two filaments interacting .",
    "if the structure is a filament , we consider whether it is dense enough to be gravitationally unstable .",
    "the clump critical mass per unit length depends only on the temperature ( ostriker 1964 ) ,    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the isothermal sound speed , and @xmath54 is the gas temperature in units of 10k .",
    "we estimate the filament s observed clump mass per unit length . adopting @xmath55k for dense clumps ( section 3.1.1 ) we get a clump critical mass per unit length for the filamentary structure detected in 30dor-10 of @xmath56/pc . from our observations and the cprops algorithm we know the length of the filamentary structure and the total calculated molecular gas mass for each clump . with these values the virial mass per unit length of m@xmath57/pc which is much larger than the critical clump mass per unit length . even adopting instead , m@xmath58 and t@xmath6100 k as extremes ,",
    "the filamentary structure would still be above the critical mass per unit length .",
    "this confirms the filamentary structure is gravitationally unstable and can collapse to form stars .",
    "the linear feature is indeed forming stars and there is some evidence that star formation appears to evolve along the structure .",
    "as mentioned in indebetouw et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , the compact star cluster k1 in the lmc is located at the tip of what they refer to as `` pillars of creation '' ( clump 4 , figure 1(d ) ) . in hco@xmath0(1 - 0 ) , we observe the dense gas associated with this pillar as a filament extending outward from the star cluster , r136 , continues back into the co cloud ( figure 2 ) . toward 30dor-10 ,",
    "h@xmath1o masers and ysos tends to correlate with the positions of hco@xmath0 clumps along the filament .",
    "additional ysos are observed to extend back toward r136 along the same line .",
    "the presence of ysos and h@xmath1o masers demonstrates that hco@xmath0 cores are currently forming stars .",
    "this suggests that the 30dor-10 clumps may be slightly younger than those near r136 and we are seeing the dispersal of molecular gas in that part of the filament .    the clumps in figure 1 ,",
    "do not appear to be randomly spaced .",
    "the clumps appear to be spaced sparsely but roughly uniformly along the filament .",
    "the idea that clumps along a filament are uniformly spaced is discussed in jackson et al .",
    "( 2010 ) for the galactic infrared dark cloud ( irdc ) known as the `` nessie '' nebula .",
    "these authors suggest stellar cluster formation arises from the fragmentation of filaments due to a varicose fluid instability . in the jackson et al .",

    "corresponds to 22 h@xmath61 , where h@xmath61 is the effective scale height ,    @xmath62    and @xmath63 is the linewidth .",
    "a self - gravitating fluid usually assumes thermal pressure to be the dominant source of gas pressure .",
    "however , in our case turbulent pressure dominates over thermal ( @xmath64c@xmath65 ; figure 3c ) .",
    "the average value of the linewidth for the clumps in 30dor-10 is 3.72 km s@xmath17 , and assuming the same central volume density as in the `` nessie '' filament , @xmath66@xmath210@xmath67@xmath68 we get a @xmath59@xmath25.7pc .",
    "observationally , the clumps along the filament are spaced @xmath2 4.8 - 7.0pc apart which is consistent with the implied @xmath59 .    in summary ,",
    "the morphology and dynamics appear consistent with the string of clumps in 30dor-10 being a gravitationally unstable filament with some evidence that the phase of star formation occurring in it evolves .",
    "changes in the l(hcn)/l(hco@xmath0 ) intensity ratios from unity found in high metallicity starburst galaxies have been variously interpreted as due to changes in dense gas density ( meijerink et al .",
    "2007 ; baan et al . 2008 ; krips et al . 2008 ; meier & turner 2012 ) or to changes in the nature of the ionization rate or source ( e.g. uv , x - rays , cosmic rays ) ( kohno et al .",
    "2001 ; graci - carpio et al .",
    "2006 ; meijerink et al .",
    "2007 ) . in higher metallicity environments ,",
    "the l(hcn)/l(hco@xmath0 ) ratio varies from 0.5-@xmath694 with a median value of @xmath70 ( e.g. graci - carpio et al .",
    "2006 ; baan et al . 2008 ;",
    "krips et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the fact that the l(hcn)/l(hco@xmath0 ) ratio is @xmath21 in high metallicity starbursts likely results from both transitions being optically thick and thermalized . since hco@xmath0 has a critical density almost an order of magnitude lower than hcn ( graci - carpio et al .",
    "2006 ; krips et al . 2008 ) , if the density drops below @xmath210@xmath71@xmath68 the l(hcn)/l(hco@xmath0 ) ratio can drop below unity even if optically thick . the effect will be more pronounced if the opacity of hcn and hco@xmath0 are lower in the lmc than in these high metallicity starbursts .",
    "thus the small l(hcn)/l(hco@xmath0 ) may suggest that both gas densities and opacities of hcn and hco@xmath0 are significantly lower in these lmc gmcs compared to higher metallicity systems .",
    "this is reasonable given the lower column densities and lower metallicities of the clumps .",
    "furthermore , there is evidence that the n / o elemental abundance is @xmath22 - 3 times lower in the lmc than in solar metallicity galactic environments ( e.g. hunter et al .",
    "if hcn and hco@xmath0 abundances reflect the n and o abundances , respectively , this may further explain a portion of the low hcn found in the lmc .",
    "compared to the l(hcn)/l(hco@xmath0 ) ratio in higher metallicity starburst environments , the ratio of the entire 30dor-10 gmc is much lower ( @xmath2 0.2 - 0.3 ) .",
    "the @xmath24 times lower value in the 30dor-10 ( as well as the other lmc gmcs ) , suggests that the dense gas physical or chemical conditions in the lmc differ from those in massive starburst galaxies",
    ". this could be due to the lower density or n / o abundance ratio in the lmc .",
    "interestingly , there is also no significant difference between the l(hcn)/l(hco@xmath0 ) ratio in 30dor-10 and the other sampled lmc gmcs ( fig 3d ) .",
    "evidently the l(hcn)/l(hco@xmath0 ) ratio is not strongly sensitive to radiation field conditions .",
    "this clearly argues against explanations that solely depend on the strength of the radiation field environment .",
    "atca observations of high dense gas tracers hco@xmath0(1 - 0 ) and hcn ( 1 - 0 ) in 30dor-10 were compared to four other star forming gmcs ( n159 , n113 , n105a and n44 ) in the lmc . along with the comparison of alma co and magma co data .",
    "our results are discussed below .    * applying cprops we detect 13 hco@xmath0 ( 1 - 0 ) bright clumps four of which are detected in hcn(1 - 0 ) .",
    "the clumps exhibit similar masses and sizes but broader linewidths , compared to clumps in the other gmcs in the lmc . for 30dor-10",
    "the ratio of @xmath50m@xmath25/@xmath50m@xmath26 @xmath2 6 which is three times the value found for the other four gmcs .    * all of the results discussed suggest that substructure in 30dor-10 is not significantly different in mass , dense gas fraction or flux from the other lmc gmcs despite the extreme uv radiation field that surrounds 30dor-10 .",
    "it appears that pdrs may not have a dramatic effect on the molecular cloud even with the presence of the super - star cluster , r136 .",
    "* we detect a linear structure that is a potential gravitationally unstable filament and likely collapsing to form stars .",
    "the morphology of the filament is in agreement with predictions by the varicose fluid instability where the clumps have roughly uniform spacings .",
    "morphology and dynamics suggest that the filament is lying approximately in the plane of the sky . toward 30dor-10 ,",
    "h@xmath1o masers and ysos tends to correlate with the positions of hco@xmath0 clumps along the filament .",
    "additional ysos are observed to extend back toward r136 along the same line .",
    "the presence of ysos and h@xmath1o masers demonstrates that hco@xmath0 cores are currently forming stars .",
    "this suggests that the 30dor-10 clumps may be slightly younger than those near r136 and we are seeing the dispersal of molecular gas in that part of the filament .",
