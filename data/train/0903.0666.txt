    "multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) antenna wireless communication systems have received enormous attention in recent years due to their ability for providing linear capacity growth without the need for increased power and bandwidth @xcite . since the important discoveries in @xcite , a major focus has been directed at investigating the mimo channel capacity under a wide range of propagation scenarios .",
    "for example , the impact of physical phenomena such as spatial correlation , line - of - sight , antenna mutual coupling , frequency - selectivity , and co - channel interference , have now been well - studied , especially for single - user mimo systems @xcite .",
    "many key results have also been derived in the multi - user context , and this is still an important topic of on - going research ( see , eg .",
    "@xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "despite the abundance of literature on mimo channel capacity , the vast majority of existing work in this area has focused primarily on systems employing optimal nonlinear receiver structures .",
    "it is very well - known , however , that such receivers can have prohibitive complexity requirements for practical systems and that low complexity receivers , such as linear minimum mean - squared error ( mmse ) receivers , are more appealing for many applications .",
    "however , despite their practical importance , there are currently few closed - form analytical results on the achievable rates of mimo mmse receivers .",
    "in fact , most prior related work has focused on studying the _ asymptotic _ achievable rates of linear mmse receivers , and has been derived in the context of code - division multiple access ( cdma ) systems employing random spreading .",
    "it is well - known that such systems , under certain conditions , are isomorphic to single - user mimo mmse systems . in this context",
    ", the primary approach has been to study the asymptotic spectral efficiency and signal to interference plus noise ratio ( sinr ) as the system dimensions grow large with fixed ratio , using advanced tools from large - dimensional random matrix theory @xcite .",
    "those results , which are extremely accurate for the high system dimensions encountered in cdma applications ( determined by the spreading factor and the number of users ) , may become less accurate for the much smaller system dimensions indicative of current mimo systems ( determined by the numbers of transmit and receive antennas ) . moreover , in many cases , the existing cdma results restrict the equivalent channel gains to be independent random variables with zero mean ; thereby precluding many mimo statistical channel models of practical interest ( eg .  correlated rayleigh and rician fading ) .",
    "an exception is the very recent work @xcite , which investigated the asymptotic ( large antenna ) mutual information distribution of mimo mmse receivers in the presence of spatial correlation .    for finite - dimensional systems with arbitrary numbers of transmit and receive antennas , there are remarkably few analytic results dealing with the achievable rates of mimo mmse receivers .",
    "the only directly related results , of which we are aware , were derived very recently in @xcite .",
    "specifically , @xcite investigated the achievable rates of mimo mmse receivers by characterizing the asymptotic diversity - multiplexing trade - off . in @xcite , expressions for the exact achievable sum rates were derived for mimo mmse receivers for uncorrelated rayleigh fading channels , based on utilizing the distribution of the corresponding sinr at the mmse receiver output .",
    "a similar method was employed in @xcite , which presented analytic expressions for the high signal to noise ratio ( snr ) regime , again restricting attention to uncorrelated rayleigh channels .",
    "the derivation approaches in @xcite and @xcite appear intractable for more general channel models . in @xcite ,",
    "properties of mutual information were used to conclude that the mmse receiver with perfect decision feedback ( ie .",
    "nonlinear ) is optimal in certain scenarios .",
    "however they did not consider the realistic case of non - perfect feedback , nor the basic case of no - feedback ( ie .",
    "the linear mmse receiver ) ; and they did not consider fading .    in this paper , we introduce a new general analytic framework for investigating the achievable sum rates of mimo systems with linear mmse receivers .",
    "our main results are based on some very simple but extremely useful algebraic manipulations which essentially relate the mimo mmse achievable sum rate to the ergodic mimo mutual information with optimal receivers .",
    "this relationship permits us to circumvent the extreme difficulties entailed with explicitly characterizing the sinr distribution at the output of the linear mmse filter , and instead to directly draw upon the vast body of existing results on ergodic mutual information from the mimo literature .",
    "in particular , using this general framework , we can obtain analytic expressions for the achievable sum rate of mimo mmse receivers in a broad class of channel scenarios , without the need to invoke a large number of antennas .",
    "we demonstrate our approach by first considering the canonical uncorrelated rayleigh fading channel , which , as mentioned above , has already been tackled using different methods in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we show that by employing our new framework , it is easy to obtain equivalent expressions to those presented in @xcite and @xcite , in addition to establishing new results .",
    "we then consider spatially - correlated rayleigh and uncorrelated rician ( line - of - sight ) fading channels , for which there are no comparable prior results .",
    "for these channels , by employing our general analytic framework , we derive new exact expressions for the achievable sum rates of mimo mmse receivers , as well as simplified characterizations in the high and low snr regimes .    in many cases ,",
    "our new analytical expressions show a clear decoupling of the effects of transmit correlation , receive correlation , and line - of - sight , which leads to key insights into the performance of mimo mmse receivers under practical channel conditions .",
    "for example , they reveal the interesting result that at both high and low snr , the achievable sum rate of mimo mmse receivers is reduced by either spatial correlation or line - of - sight . at high snr , this rate loss is due to an increased power offset , whereas at low snr , through a reduced wideband slope .",
    "we also present an analytical comparison between the achievable rates of mimo mmse receivers , and those of optimal receivers .",
    "interestingly , we show that at both high and low snrs , although both mmse and optimal receivers incur a rate loss due to either spatial correlation or line - of - sight , the loss is more significant for mmse .",

    "<S> this paper investigates the achievable sum rate of multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) wireless systems employing linear minimum mean - squared error ( mmse ) receivers . </S>",
    "<S> we present a new analytic framework which unveils an interesting connection between the achievable sum rate with mmse receivers and the ergodic mutual information achieved with optimal receivers . </S>",
    "<S> this simple but powerful result enables the vast prior literature on ergodic mimo mutual information to be directly applied to the analysis of mmse receivers . </S>",
    "<S> the framework is particularized to various rayleigh and rician channel scenarios to yield new exact closed - form expressions for the achievable sum rate , as well as simplified expressions in the asymptotic regimes of high and low signal to noise ratios . </S>",
    "<S> these expressions lead to the discovery of key insights into the performance of mimo mmse receivers under practical channel conditions .    </S>",
