    "direct photons - defined as those not originating from ( final state ) hadron decays - are an important tool with unique capabilities to study both elementary particle and heavy ion collisions . by not interacting",
    "strongly they have a large mean free path and leave the interaction region unaltered even if they propagate through the hot , dense medium assumed to be formed in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "the lowest order qcd processes generating photons - quark - antiquark annihilation ( @xmath3 ) and quark - gluon compton scattering ( @xmath4 ) - are reasonably well understood  @xcite thus photons are a sensitive probe of modifications of the parton distribution functions in nuclei ( npdfs ) .",
    "furthermore , in @xmath1+@xmath1 collisions at higher transverse momenta ( @xmath0 ) the compton process dominates , thus the photon `` calibrates '' the total energy of the opposing gluon jet ( apart of the uncertainty stemming from the intrinsic @xmath5 of partons ) . setting the energy scale of the hard scattered parton ( and the ensuing jet ) is even more important in heavy ion collisions , where the partons lose a significant fraction of their energy while crossing the medium  @xcite .    at higher order fragmentation ( or bremsstrahlung ) photons",
    "contribute both in @xmath1+@xmath1 and heavy ion collisions ; the calculated rates in @xmath1+@xmath1 are consistent with recent measurements but the uncertainties are large both on the theoretical and experimental side  @xcite .",
    "it is very important to understand all @xmath1+@xmath1 processes as well as possible because in heavy ion collisions several new photon production mechanisms emerge or become significant , and often it is exactly the _ difference _ from @xmath1+@xmath1 behavior that reveals the new physics .",
    "case in point : the nuclear modification factor @xmath6 , the ratio of a cross - section measured in a+a collisions and the corresponding @xmath1+@xmath1 cross - section scaled by the nuclear thickness function .",
    "if @xmath6 is different from unity , it invariably signals some new physics in a+a with respect to @xmath1+@xmath1 collisions . if @xmath7 the interpretation is somewhat less clear : either the physics mechanisms producing photons are exactly the same as in @xmath1+@xmath1 , or there might possibly be a `` conspiracy '' of mechanisms , some increasing , others decreasing @xmath6 but ultimately balancing each other . also , one has to be careful when interpreting direct photon @xmath6 . for high @xmath0 hadrons ( thought to be mostly leading fragments of jets ) scaling the @xmath1+@xmath1 cross - sections with the nuclear thickness to obtain",
    "the expected a+a rates ( colloquially `` scaling with the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions '' or `` @xmath8 scaling '' ) is legitimate due to the isospin symmetry of protons and neutrons in the nucleus .",
    "the same is not true for direct photons : due to the electromagnetic coupling the photon cross section is proportional to the sum @xmath9 of quark charges squared , different for @xmath1 and @xmath10 , causing a trivial deviation of @xmath6 from unity ( `` isospin effect ''  @xcite ) which may either mask or enhance other effects changing @xmath6 . in fact , the cleanest way to generate direct photon @xmath6 would be to compare to a properly scaled mixture of @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 cross - sections at the same energy , which could ( and in the author s private opinion , should ) be measured at rhic from @xmath14+@xmath14 collisions , since the above three reactions could be tagged event - by - event .    while direct photons carry a plethora of ( almost ) unbiased information , measuring them is very challenging due to the large background from hadron decays .",
    "substantial statistics and a thorough understanding of systematic errors are required . if in addition to the total direct photon yield one wants to _ disentangle _ the contributions from different physics sources ( with minimal theoretical input and assumptions ) the difficulties are even higher - but not insurmountable .",
    "studying the emergence and evolution of new phenomena and at the same time tight control of the systematics is crucial . in specific , measuring various colliding systems ( from @xmath1+@xmath1 to the heaviest a+a ) at different c.m.s .",
    "energies in the very same experiment goes a long way toward this goal .",
    "the flexibility of the accelerator and of the experiments at rhic offers such an opportunity .",
    "direct photon cross - sections in @xmath15gev @xmath1+@xmath1 collisions at rhic were first published in the limited @xmath16gev/@xmath17 range in  @xcite , followed by a measurement in the @xmath18gev/@xmath17 range with considerably smaller systematic errors and detailed comparison to nlo pqcd calculations  @xcite .",
    "it was found that above @xmath19gev/@xmath17 ( where the systematic errors of the experiment and theory were comparable ) the data are well described by the theory , including the fraction of isolated photons .",
    "this was welcome news after the `` controversial situation ''  @xcite of the past decade .",
    "since rhic collides polarized protons , a measurement of the polarized gluon structure functions is now within reach .",
    "the data also provide a measured - rather than calculated - baseline for the nuclear modification in heavy ion collisions ( _ modulo _ the isospin - effect ) .",
    "the first direct photon invariant yields up to @xmath20gev/@xmath17 from @xmath21gev au+au collisions were published in  @xcite , covering all collision centralities ( impact parameter ranges ) and in the same paper the direct photon @xmath6 , using an nlo pqcd reference and integrated above @xmath19gev/@xmath17 was shown to be unity within errors for all centralities .",
    "this was a landmark result because it retroactively validated the concept of `` @xmath8-scaling '' and @xmath6 itself in studying `` jet - quenching '' at high @xmath0 with single inclusive hadron spectra  @xcite .",
    "although recent developments in theory and better data help to draw a more nuanced picture of how , where and when high @xmath0 photons are produced ( in addition to primordial hard scattering ) , the above conclusion is still sane , not the least thanks to the large differences between the effects : @xmath22-s are suppressed by a factor of 5 , while direct photons ( still _ mostly _ from hard scattering ) are suppressed much less , or not at all .",
    "more recent ( and still preliminary ) data on direct photon @xmath6 and comparisons to theoretical calculations are shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : raa ] . with the @xmath0 range",
    "now extended to 20gev/@xmath17 photons appear to be somewhat suppressed . as mentioned before , some of this might be of trivial origin ; the solid line predicts a 15% drop due to the isospin effect alone . counteracting to this - particularly at medium @xmath0 , _",
    "i.e. _ in the @xmath23 region - is the anti - shadowing ( dash - dotted curve ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if parton energy loss is added , direct photon production is suppressed in the entire range ( band at the bottom of the figure ) .    while the energy loss in the medium suppresses the yield of high @xmath0 particles , possibly including photons , the `` jet - photon conversion '' mechanism  @xcite may increase high @xmath0 photon production . in this process a hard scattered quark ( proto - jet ) interacts with a gluon or antiquark of the medium .",
    "the collision has a collinear singularity thus the outcoming photon carries the full momentum of the original parton",
    ". note that since antiquarks abund in the thermalized medium , @xmath24 annihilation is no longer suppressed with respect to compton - scattering of gluons thus a new channel to direct photon production opens up .",
    "an up - to - date overview of the known / assumed direct photon production mechanisms in heavy ion collisions is given in  @xcite and detailed , centrality - dependent calculations are shown in  @xcite .",
    "the tantalizing question is whether the contributions from the individual components can be disentangled experimentally ?",
    "in other words : can the theory be tested ?",
    "the answer is a tentative `` yes '' with a possible path laid out in  @xcite and briefly repeated here .",
    "first , one has to realize that future , substantially larger data volumes not only decrease the statistical errors , but they also help to apply more sophisticated analysis techniques that reduce the systematic errors . also , they allow meaningful analyses of multiple - differential quantities like azimuthal asymmetries of photon production . while such asymmetries are not expected from the primordial hard scattering , medium - related photon sources will exhibit them .",
    "by now it is well established that due to the azimuthally asymmetric overlap geometry in all but the most central nucleus - nucleus collisions the pressure gradients and thus the momentum distributions of final state hadrons are asymmetric in azimuth ( `` flow '' ) .",
    "the second fourier - component ( @xmath25 ) of the azimuthal distribution of momenta is positive for all hadrons , therefore , @xmath26 for all hadron decay photons as well ( the background to the direct photon measurement ) .",
    "also , @xmath26 for jet fragmentation photons .",
    "on the other hand medium - induced photons typically exhibit @xmath27 , corresponding to the longer average pathlength of the parton in the medium .",
    "however , within this category jet - photon conversion photons are isolated whereas bremsstrahlung photons are not .",
    "these properties might help to disentangle the different production mechanisms of direct photons .",
    "thermal radiation of photons from the quark - gluon plasma is expected to dominate in the @xmath28gev/@xmath17 region , where the measurement of ( real ) direct photons with classic calorimetry is nearly impossible due to the large hadron decay background .",
    "however , one can measure `` quasi - real '' virtual photons which manifest themselves as low mass @xmath2 pairs  @xcite . with this technique - applied for the first time in heavy ion collisions - the phenix experiment measured the fraction of direct photons in the total inclusive photon spectrum both in @xmath1+@xmath1 and au+au collisions .",
    "the results are shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : thermal ] and compared to nlo pqcd calculations . in @xmath1+@xmath1 the results are clearly consistent with the calculations ( no new , unknown sources ) , while in au+au we observe a statistically significant , 10% excess at low @xmath0 . converting this excess into invariant yield and fitting it with an exponential we find  @xcite an inverse slope @xmath29mev .",
    "note that lattice qcd predicts a phase transition already at @xmath30170mev , far below the value fitted to our data .",
    "also , since the observed direct photon spectrum is the integral over the entire thermal history of the system , the above @xmath31mev estimate is almost certainly a lower bound only , and the initial temperature @xmath32 of the system is much higher .",
