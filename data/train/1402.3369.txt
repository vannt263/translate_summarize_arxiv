    "graphene , an atomic - thin sheet of carbon atoms , was isolated from graphite using the micromechanical cleavage technique@xcite .",
    "it has remarkable mechanical@xcite , electronic@xcite , transport@xcite and optical@xcite properties . since its isolation in 2004",
    ", it has drawn a lot of interest due to its unique zero gap electronic band - structure at the dirac point with chiral and massless linear dispersion of dirac fermions .",
    "+ in the past several years , the research has rapidly moved on from single to bi-@xcite , double-@xcite and multi - layer graphene@xcite as they display plethora of intriguing properties due to the inherent chiral symmetry of the underlying bipartite lattice structure .",
    "such multi layer systems are formed by stacking graphene on top of each other and they can be either electronically coupled or decoupled .",
    "the spatially separate double - layer graphene@xcite , where they are coupled only via the long - range coulomb interaction , are particularly very fascinating as they exhibit variety of phenomena like the plasmon effects@xcite , excitonic condensate or frictional coulomb drag@xcite and van der waals ( vdw ) interaction@xcite .",
    "it turns out that these physical phenomena are not only useful in probing the interaction effects in such systems but are also important in designing modern technological devices as they can be separated in the order of nanometer scale .",
    "+ recently the low dimensional vdw heterostructures has attracted a great deal of attention as they provide a stage for new materials to study interesting effects and to realize quantum engineered devices with unprecedented qualities for modern applications@xcite .",
    "the van der waals force between electrically neutral atoms or molecules arises due to the instantaneous dipole induced by the fluctuating electron cloud around the nucleus and is normally attractive .",
    "it is so ubiquitous in nature that its study covers almost all areas of natural sciences and has wide range of utilization among interdisciplinary subjects@xcite .",
    "this long range and weak force plays a very crucial role in the investigation of interaction between the materials@xcite .",
    "thus thorough understanding of vdw interactions and utilizing non - covalent nanomaterials , for instance carbon - based graphene , forms a crucial step towards future technology@xcite .",
    "+ graphene as a two - dimensional sheet has extraordinary mechanical strength@xcite , but can also be subjected to strain leading to anisotropic electronic behavior .",
    "it is known that the lattice distortion , due to uniaxial strain , in graphene can alter its electronic band structure@xcite , optical@xcite as well as magnetic@xcite properties and also demonstrates interplay with many - body interactions@xcite and electron - plasmon scattering@xcite .",
    "it is also possible to open a finite band gap in the electronic spectrum , which would be highly desirable for the semiconductor - based technology@xcite , but only at the expense of very large deformations applied along a specific direction@xcite . due to the lack of achieving substantial deformations in graphene ,",
    "there has not been been much work reported on applying strain in two- or multi - layered graphene .",
    "+ besides tailoring the electronic band - structure of graphene using strain , the many - body interactions also play an important role in understanding the fundamental physical properties as well as for applications in technical devices .",
    "these interactions are normally more pronounced in low dimensional materials and are visible as intrinsic enhancement of coulomb interactions as well as reduced screening in these materials . in graphene , the low - energy behavior of the dirac quasiparticles is remarkably modified due to the electron - electron interactions and is evident in terms of the fractional quantum hall effect@xcite and renormalization of the fermi velocity@xcite among various other striking results@xcite .",
    "in addition to the mono - layer , various interesting phenomena related to many - body interactions were also observed in double - layer graphene@xcite .",
    "+ thus it would be captivating to study the effects of the electron - electron interactions along with strain on the vdw interactions between two - layer graphene and this forms the main motivation of this paper .",
    "our aim is to obtain the vdw force acting between two uniaxially strained clean graphene layers at zero temperature and which are separated by a finite distance . in section  [ sec : amd ] we introduce the three anisoptropic models and obtain the vdw interaction energy per unit area in each of these cases .",
    "we consider an effective coulomb interaction between the graphene sheets derived with in random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "the numerical results , discussed in section  [ sec : numres ] , are divided in to two parts . in subsection",
    "[ sec : woeei ] we examine the variation in the vdw force coefficient as a function of applied uniaxial strain for different values of the strength of effective interaction or coupling constant . and",
    "in subsection  [ sec : weei ] we additionally consider the effect of intra - layer electron - electron interaction on the vdw interaction energy as the distance between the two layers is increased . in section  [ sec : sumcon ] we summarize the results and present our conclusions .",
    "we are interested in evaluating the van der waals ( vdw ) interaction energy or the vdw force per unit area at zero temperature ( t=0 ) between two charge neutral strained graphene layers separated by a finite distance .",
    "we begin by indicating that for any interacting many electron system , the total energy consists of its kinetic , exchange and correlation energy . in our study , the intra - layer kinetic and the exchange energy are independent of the distance between the two layers and there s no inter - layer exchange energy since we assume that the separation between the two layers are large enough to neglect any overlap between the electronic wavefunctions .",
    "thus the many - body electronic correlation energy , a part of which is the weak long - ranged vdw interaction energy , is the only quantity which depends on the separation between the layers@xcite .",
    "the vdw interaction arises because of the induced dipole - dipole interaction due to the correlated motion of the electrons in both the layers and in the presence of an effective inter - layer coulomb interaction between the layers .",

    "[ fig:1 ] , the vdw force per unit area at t=0 was derived in several different ways@xcite and a consistent power law dependence on the distance was obtained which varied as d@xmath0 in both the non - retarded@xcite and retarded@xcite regimes .",
    "this was due to the fact that in such a system for no doping and zero temperature , the force of attraction resulted from the interaction of the charge - density oscillations within the graphene crystal and there was no characteristic temperature scale .",
    "therefore if one neglected the effects of intra - layer coulomb interaction then there was no physical quantity which had a dependence on the distance of separation between the graphene layers .",
    "moreover , under that condition the retardation effects were also shown to be practically irrelevant for such a system@xcite .",
    "we would also like to remark that , surprisingly , the above mentioned power law dependence was in sharp contrast to the case of two layers of two - dimensional metals ( d@xmath1 ) or insulators ( d@xmath2 ) and the difference was attributed to the unique bandstructure of graphene@xcite .",
    "there have also been studies reporting finite temperature@xcite calculations and with doped as well as gapped graphene@xcite .",

    "our starting point is the evaluation of the vdw interaction energy at zero temperature .",
    "it is known that the result for the interaction energy within the random phase approximation ( rpa )  @xcite , which takes into account both intra- and inter - layer screening , is equivalent to the non - retarded version of the well - known lifshitz approach @xcite .",
    "retardation effects can be easily taken into account but are known to be negligible in unstrained graphene @xcite .",
    "however we will show later that in the limit of large strain retardation effects have to be taken into account , otherwise the force grows uncontrollably .",
    "thus our starting expression for the interaction energy is :    @xmath6    where the dielectric functions in the layers , labeled @xmath7(top ) and @xmath8(bottom ) , are given as @xmath9 . here",

    ", the isotropic bandstructure of the dirac fermions becomes anisotropic giving rise to two different velocities ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) along the two spatial ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) directions .",
    "with a fixed co - ordinate system and depending on the direction of the strain , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , we define the anisotropy parameter proportional to the ratio of the two velocities such that the velocity along the direction of applied strain is always in the numerator . thus if the strain is applied along the @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) direction of a given layer ( @xmath18 ) , then the anisotropy parameter is @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) where it is assumed @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) and that we are interested in the range @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "it is worth pointing out that in the numerical results to follow we ll approximate the larger velocity @xmath15 ( @xmath14 ) , for the applied strain along @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) direction respectively , equal to its isotropic limit @xmath25 , i.e. the fermi velocity .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the tight - binding calculations of the uniaxially strained graphene , the larger velocity does nt deviate much from its isotropic value@xcite . for further details on the nature of anisotropic velocities and the bandstructure ( dirac cones ) near a dirac point due to the application of uniaxial strain in graphene , see for example section ii in ref .  .",

    "it is straightforward to see that the vdw force coefficient diverges due to the integration over the frequency .",
    "this suggests that the retardation - induced upper cutoff@xcite for the scaled dimensionless frequency should be kept , i.e the integration should be performed as @xmath57 .",

    "<S> we evaluate the van der waals ( vdw ) interaction energy at zero temperature between two undoped strained graphene layers separated by a finite distance . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the following three models for the anisotropic case : ( a ) where one of the two layers is uniaxially strained , ( b ) the two layers are strained in the same direction , and ( c ) one of the layers is strained in the perpendicular direction with respect to the other . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for all three models and given value of the electron - electron interaction coupling , the vdw interaction energy increases with increasing anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> the effect is most striking for the case when both layers are strained in the same direction where we observe up to an order of magnitude increase in the strained relative to the unstrained case . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the effect of electron electron interaction renormalization in the region of large separation between the strained graphene layers . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the many - body renormalization contributions to the correlation energy are non negligible and the vdw interaction energy decreases as a function of increasing distance between the layers due to renormalization of the fermi velocity , the anisotropy , and the effective interaction . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis can be useful in designing novel graphene - based vdw heterostructures which , in recent times , has seen an upsurge in research activity . </S>"
