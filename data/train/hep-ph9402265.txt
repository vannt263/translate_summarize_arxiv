    "the derivation of large radiative corrections to higgs boson masses@xcite and couplings in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm)@xcite has led a number of groups@xcite to re - evaluate prospects for susy higgs detection at various colliding beam facilities . most of these studies have focused on regions of mssm parameter space where various standard model ( sm ) decay modes ( _ e.g. _ @xmath1 and @xmath2 or @xmath3 ) of the susy higgs bosons are detectable above background ; parameter space choices were selected such that susy particle masses were large so that higgs boson decays to sparticles were kinematically forbidden .",
    "a region of parameter space roughly spanning pseudoscalar higgs mass @xmath4  gev and ratio of higgs vevs @xmath5 ( for @xmath6 , the observability of the signal is sensitive to the detectability of the @xmath7 decay modes of the higgs bosons@xcite ) was found where _ none _ of the sm decay modes were detectable@xcite .",
    "very recently , it has been argued@xcite that higgs bosons , produced in association with @xmath8-quark pairs and identified via their dominant @xmath9 decays may fill this  hole \" , provided that sufficient @xmath10-tagging capability can be achieved .    over the last year or two ,",
    "several groups@xcite have studied grand unified models within the supergravity framework and have shown that it is quite possible to construct models consistent with constraints from colliders , proton decay experiments and cosmology .",
    "interestingly , these analyses generally find that the sparticles are all considerably lighter than 1 tev , and further , that the lighter chargino ( @xmath11 ) and the two lighter neutralinos ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) frequently have masses in the range 50 - 150 gev so that these may well be accessible via the decays of the mssm higgs bosons .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we studied how these supersymmetric decay modes would affect the phenomenology of the higgs sector .",
    "we showed that the chargino and neutralino decays of mssm higgs bosons have substantial branching fractions when kinematically allowed , and can sometimes even dominate the usual decay modes .",
    "decays to top squark pairs can similarly be significant since @xmath14 , the lighter of the two @xmath8-squarks , can be much lighter than all other squarks .",
    "these new decay channels lead to a diminution of the rate into the standard decay modes so that the above - mentioned `` hole '' in parameter space becomes larger . moreover , the region of parameter space where more than one of the higgs bosons is visible above background ( leading to unambiguous evidence for a non - minimal higgs sector ) is substantially diminished .",
    "one may also ask if the new supersymmetric decay modes of higgs bosons can lead to new avenues for detection .",
    "decay modes of the neutral higgs bosons into @xmath15 and into @xmath16 will lead in general to final states containing @xmath17 leptons plus jets plus @xmath18 ; at the proposed cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) , such signals are expected to be buried beneath standard model backgrounds from processes such as top quark pair production . a more promising signature@xcite may be found by searching for @xmath19 , where the neutralinos decay leptonically via @xmath20 .",
    "such a process leads to a final state with as many as four isolated leptons plus @xmath18 , which is expected to have small sm backgrounds .",
    "in addition , kinematic information from the @xmath21 final state can yield information on not only the higgs boson masses , but also on the masses of @xmath13 and @xmath12@xcite",
    ". signals for invisible decays of higgs bosons via @xmath22 have also been considered@xcite .    in this paper , we seek to expand upon and improve the calculations presented in ref .",
    "@xcite regarding signals from supersymmetric decays of the higgs bosons .",
    "in particular ,    * we incorporate radiative corrections to the susy higgs boson masses and couplings , from both top and bottom yukawa interactions , and effects from mixing between third generation squarks , * we include higgs boson decays into squarks and sleptons  these can be very important since decays to @xmath14 pairs may be allowed , * we have included higgs production via @xmath23 fusion , which is the main production mechanism for large values of @xmath24 , * we have included effects from non - degenerate squark and slepton masses , which can lead to enhanced@xcite leptonic decays of the neutralino , resulting in a much larger signal .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , we describe in some detail the improvements and extensions we have made to our earlier calculation . in sec . 3",
    ", we present cross - sections for the various signals as a function of model parameters . in sec . 4 , we present background calculations , and suggest a set of experimental cuts useful for extracting the signal",
    ". we also estimate efficiencies due to these cuts . in sec . 5 , we present our conclusions regarding detectability of the susy higgs bosons via both the standard model decays as well as via the supersymmetric @xmath25 signal , along with a summary of our results .",
    "as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have computed the masses and mixing angles in the higgs boson sector using the 1-loop effective potential . we have , however , improved on our previous calculation in several respects .",
    "we now include the effects of both top and bottom family yukawa interactions ( the latter interactions , which were neglected in ref .",
    "@xcite , can be important if @xmath24 is large ) as well as effects from supersymmetric and susy - breaking trilinear scalar interactions of the scalar top ( scalar bottom ) higgs system .",
    "these trilinear couplings lead to mixing between the l- and r- type sfermions , and so further reduce the mass of the lighter mass eigenstate",
    ". this can be especially important for @xmath8-squarks , whose mass is already expected to be smaller than that of other squarks on account of the large top yukawa coupling , since the branching fraction for the @xmath15 decay mode can be very large if @xmath26 .",
    "finally , we have also included d - term contributions @xcite to the effective potential , but generally speaking , their effects are small .",
    "these modifications lead to improvements in the calculation of some of the decay modes of the higgs bosons .",
    "first , radiative corrections at the same level as those mentioned in the last paragraph are incorporated into the calculation of the @xmath27-@xmath28-@xmath28 vertex .",
    "second , higgs decays into sfermions are now added .",
    "as mentioned , the sfermion masses including d - terms have been calculated with intra - flavor mixing from non - zero values for @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "these modifications to squark masses and mixings also affect the loop decays of the higgs bosons into two gluons which , in turn , affects higgs production by gluon fusion .    in the mssm ,",
    "the bottom quark yukawa coupling is inversely proportional to the parameter @xmath32 .",
    "hence , the @xmath33 width ( here , @xmath34 is a generic higgs boson ) as well as the subprocess cross section @xmath35 are enhanced in regions of large @xmath24 . in our calculations",
    ", we include higgs boson production cross sections via @xmath36 and @xmath23 fusion .",
    "the formula for @xmath37 is well known@xcite ; for @xmath23 fusion , we use the result @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the @xmath10 parton distribution function in the proton , and @xmath41^{-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( with @xmath42 in gev ) is a fit to the results of ref.@xcite to incorporate contributions of higher order graphs to the @xmath23 fusion mechanism .",
    "we use the ehlq set 1@xcite @xmath10 and @xmath43 parton distributions , and take the sm parameters to be @xmath44 gev , @xmath45 , @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "it has been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that leptonic decays of neutralinos can be enhanced by large factors if squarks are significantly heavier than sleptons ( as is the case in the `` no - scale''@xcite limit ) , and the @xmath48 coupling is dynamically suppressed .",
    "this suppression is common in supergravity models with radiative electroweak symmetry breaking since , in this case , @xmath49@xcite  as a result , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are respectively mainly u(1 ) and su(2 ) gauginos and so have suppressed couplings to the z boson .",
    "we calculate slepton masses as usual by using renormalization group equations to evolve sfermion masses from a common gut scale scalar mass to their weak scale values@xcite . in our computation of the neutralino mass matrix",
    "we have , as usual , assumed that the @xmath50 gaugino masses unify at some ultrahigh energy scale .",
    "we then evolve these down to the electroweak scale .",
    "however , in the following , we present our results in terms of the physical pole gluino mass which we relate to the corresponding @xmath50 mass using the result of ref.@xcite . finally , we note that we have not included qcd corrections to higgs production and decay via loops@xcite .",
    "once the various higgs boson production cross sections via @xmath36 and @xmath23 fusion as well as the @xmath51 and @xmath52 branching ratios are known , the total rate for @xmath53 ) can be calculated .",
    "the cross section is a function of the mssm model parameters ( @xmath54 ) ; the slepton masses are related as given in ref . @xcite .",
    "of course , in supergravity models with radiative electroweak symmetry breaking , there is some correlation amongst these parameters : typically , @xmath31 scales with @xmath55 , and @xmath56 is strongly correlated with @xmath31 and the universal gut scale scalar mass .",
    "the parameter choices used in this paper to illustrate our results are inspired , but not ruled , by the supergravity mass relations .",
    "we begin by showing in fig .",
    "1 a contour plot in the @xmath56 vs. @xmath24 plane of @xmath57 ( @xmath58 or @xmath31 ) in @xmath59 , at @xmath60  tev .",
    "we take @xmath61  gev , while @xmath62 , and @xmath63  gev .",
    "the scalar top masses are set at their default values : @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .",
    "the region in black is excluded by the non - observation of supersymmetry signals in experiments at lep as parametrized in ref.@xcite but taking into account the recent limit of 63.5 gev on the mass of the sm higgs boson@xcite .",
    "1_a _ shows results for @xmath66 , while fig .",
    "1_b _ shows results for @xmath67 .",
    "we note the following features .    *",
    "the @xmath68 cross section exceeds @xmath69",
    "@xmath59 for small values of @xmath24 and @xmath70  gev , just below threshold for @xmath71 decay whereas the corresponding cross section from @xmath27 does not exceed 100 @xmath59 . over a wide range of parameters ,",
    "away from @xmath72 , the two processes give comparable cross sections .",
    "the large difference between the scalar and pseudoscalar contributions to the signal for small values of @xmath24 mainly comes from the difference in their susy branching fractions@xcite . *",
    "the signal from the decays of @xmath73 and @xmath27 are separately larger than 5 @xmath59 for 200 gev @xmath74 gev . since",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath73 are expected to be roughly degenerate over the range of masses where the signal is significant , this corresponds to a total of 250 - 25k @xmath25 events at the lhc before any selection cuts , assuming a data sample with @xmath75 @xmath76 .",
    "interestingly , the signal has a larger rate in the region below the dashed line , where the lighter chargino is heavier than 90 gev , which we take to roughly represent the supersymmetry reach of lep ii ( we note that this region is rather sensitive to the precise value of the chargino mass reach that is assumed ) .",
    "the higgs bosons @xmath28 and @xmath73 may themselves be directly accessible at lep ii .",
    "the range of parameters where this is possible is discussed in the last section and illustrated in fig . 7 for one choice of parameters . *",
    "although we have not shown this , we have checked that for values of @xmath77 , both @xmath27 and @xmath73 cross sections are dominated by gluon fusion , while @xmath9 fusion , which was ignored in ref.@xcite , dominates for @xmath78 . *",
    "the cross section for @xmath21 events has an observable rate in part of the `` hole region '' , where @xmath79 and @xmath80  gev .",
    "this is the region where no sm decays of mssm higgs are observable ( except for possible observation of @xmath33 ) . of course , the range over which this signal might be observable is sensitive to @xmath31 and @xmath55 since the cross section drops sharply to zero when the kinematic limit for the decays @xmath81 is approached .",
    "the contours of the @xmath25 cross section are shown in the @xmath82 plane in fig . 2 for ( _ a _ )",
    "@xmath73 decays and ( _ b _ ) @xmath27 decays .",
    "the pseudoscalar mass is fixed to be 250 gev , which is within the hole region for the light @xmath11 and @xmath83 case illustrated here .",
    "other parameters are as in fig .",
    "we see that the signal cross section exceeds 10 @xmath59 for a wide region of parameter space .",
    "again , the black region is excluded by lep constraints and the dashed line is the contour @xmath84 gev ( the region above the dashed contour has @xmath85 gev ) . in the upper corners of fig .",
    "2 , @xmath86 gev , because of @xmath87 yukawa interactions which have substantial effects for large values of @xmath24@xcite .",
    "while the signal is small for small values of @xmath88 , it is instructive to see that the @xmath25 rate appears to be observable for @xmath49 as expected in supergravity models with radiative ew symmetry breaking .",
    "finally , we observe that the pseudoscalar higgs boson tends to give a larger signal than the heavy scalar , and further , that the signal is significantly larger if @xmath31 happens to be negative in our convention .    in fig .",
    "3 , we study the dependence of the signal on the squark mass for a fixed value of @xmath55 . here",
    ", @xmath56 is fixed at 250 gev ; other parameters are as in fig .",
    "we see that the @xmath25 cross section rapidly drops off as @xmath89 increases from @xmath55 to larger values . for values of @xmath90 , the cross section shows a slow increase for rather large squark masses .",
    "as expected , the squark mass dependence of the cross section is mostly determined by that of the leptonic branching fraction of the @xmath13 . for @xmath91 ,",
    "the sleptons are considerably lighter than the squarks resulting@xcite in an enhancement of @xmath52 decays , and hence , in the @xmath25 cross section .",
    "the increase in the cross section for large values of @xmath89 comes from interference between various amplitudes .",
    "we see that the signal has an observable rate even if squarks are significantly heavier than gluinos .",
    "amusingly , the cross section is largest below the dashed line where the chargino is likely to be undetectable at lep ii .    before closing this discussion we mention that we have checked that the @xmath25 cross section is relatively insensitive to the @xmath92-parameters or to the precise value of @xmath93 except when the threshold for a new decay is crossed .",
    "this is especially important when considering the variation of the signal with @xmath29 , since @xmath94 decays become kinematically accessible when @xmath95 becomes very large .",
    "finally , we have also studied the variation of the signal with @xmath55 . for @xmath96 gev , and @xmath97",
    ", the signal exceeds 5 @xmath59 for gluinos as heavy as 350 - 400 gev .",
    "this is reasonable since then , @xmath98 is approaching the kinematic boundary of @xmath99 decays .",
    "we have seen that the neutralino decays of the pseudoscalar and the heavy neutral scalar higgs bosons of the mssm can result in several hundred to several thousand events with four isolated leptons together in an lhc data sample of 50 @xmath76",
    ". these events should be very distinctive since , except for qcd radiation , they would be free of hadronic activity . within the sm , isolated leptons mainly arise from the the production and decays of the @xmath100 and @xmath101 bosons and of the top quark . the main background from @xmath2 pair production can be efficiently removed by vetoing events where like - flavour , opposite sign leptons reconstruct the @xmath101 mass within @xmath102 gev .",
    "we have verified this by generating 10k @xmath2 events using isajet ( and forcing the leptonic decay of the z bosons ) .",
    "no events are found after the mass cut , resulting in an upper bound on the @xmath25 cross section of about 0.003 @xmath59 .",
    "this would , of course , also remove the signal if the decay @xmath103 is kinematically accessible ; fortunately for the range of parameters where we find the signal to be substantial , this decay is kinematically inaccessible , so that this requirement results in very little loss of the signal .",
    "the signal can also be mimicked by @xmath104 or @xmath105 production .",
    "these backgrounds can easily be removed by vetoing events with a central jet in addition to the @xmath101-mass veto already mentioned .",
    "the main sm physics background thus comes from electroweak multi-@xmath100 production . at the lhc",
    ", the trilepton cross section from @xmath106 production has been shown@xcite to be about 2 @xmath59 , so that the background to the signal from @xmath107 production should be negligible .",
    "because the cross section for @xmath108 production at the lhc is very large , one may also worry that these may provide a significant background when the leptons from the daughter bottom quarks are accidently isolated ; a simulation of 300k @xmath108 events with forced top quark decays yielded no background , giving a limit @xmath109 .",
    "we have been unable to identify any significant sm sources of physics backgrounds to the susy higgs boson signal .    within the mssm framework",
    ", however , the continuum production of @xmath13 pairs@xcite can also result in the same signal .",
    "these are produced by @xmath110 annihilation via @xmath111-channel @xmath101 exchange or @xmath8- and @xmath112-channel squark exchange .",
    "while the detection of these continuum neutralino pairs would in itself be very exciting , it is interesting to ask whether @xmath113 production via @xmath27 and @xmath73 decays is distinguishable from the continuum production of @xmath13 which , in effect , is the background to our higgs signal . toward this end , we have shown in fig .",
    "4 the cross section for @xmath25 production via continuum @xmath113 production as a function of @xmath24 . to compare with @xmath13 production via higgs boson decays discussed in the last section , we have taken @xmath114 gev and illustrated our results for @xmath115 ( solid line ) and @xmath116 ( dashed line ) .",
    "the pseudoscalar higgs boson mass is fixed to be 250 gev and other parameters are fixed as in fig . 1 - 3 .",
    "we see that while the cross section is sensitive to the squark mass it is relatively insensitive to @xmath24 over the region where the cross section is significant .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath117 , the cross section is 10 - 30 @xmath59 which is generally comparable to , or smaller than , the cross sections in fig . 2 for a wide range of parameters .",
    "we use isajet 7.07@xcite to simulate the @xmath25 higgs boson signal .",
    "since explicit susy higgs production has not yet been incorporated into this code , we simulate the production of @xmath27 or @xmath73 by decaying the sm higgs scalar into a @xmath13 pair and forcing the susy decay mode ; the total cross section is then normalized to the results of fig . 1 - 3 .",
    "we use the toy calorimeter simulation package isaplt to model detector effects .",
    "we simulate calorimetry with cell size @xmath118 , which extends between @xmath119 in pseudorapidity .",
    "we take electromagnetic energy resolution to be @xmath120 , while hadronic resolution is @xmath121 for @xmath122 , and @xmath123 for @xmath124 , where @xmath125 denotes addition in quadrature .",
    "jets are coalesced within cones of @xmath126 using the isajet routine getjet .",
    "hadronic clusters with @xmath127 gev are labelled as jets .",
    "muons and electrons are classified as isolated if they have @xmath128 gev , @xmath129 , and the visible activity within a cone of @xmath130 about the lepton direction is less than @xmath131 gev .",
    "we then impose the following cuts designed to select signal events , while vetoing sm backgrounds from @xmath2 and @xmath132 production :    * require _ two _ isolated leptons with @xmath133 gev to trigger the event , * require _ two _ more isolated leptons with @xmath134 gev , * require all opposite sign but same flavor dilepton pairs to have invariant mass @xmath135 gev or @xmath136 gev , * require number of jets @xmath137",
    ".    a cut on @xmath18 could be considered instead of the above dilepton mass cut . however , the @xmath18 spectrum from the signal is not so hard , while forward jet production and energy mis - measurement in @xmath2 events can lead to substantial @xmath18 , so that the dilepton mass cut wins over an @xmath18 cut in rejecting background while preserving signal .",
    "we should stress that there are no significant sm backgrounds even before the last cut .",
    "backgrounds involving the @xmath101 are efficiently removed by the @xmath138 cut .",
    "the main physics background would then be expected to come from @xmath105 production which gives a @xmath25 cross section around 0.05@xmath59 at the lhc , even before acceptance cuts@xcite .",
    "the last cut which removes about 40% ( 70% ) of the signal for a higgs mass around 200 gev ( 400 gev ) has been imposed to separate neutralino production from the cascade decays of gluinos and squarks@xcite which can also produce multilepton events at observable rates .    in order to give the reader an idea of the impact of the cuts on the @xmath25 signal , we have shown these cross sections for illustrative choices of @xmath56 and @xmath24 in table",
    "i. we have added the contributions from @xmath27 and @xmath73 decays since these are expected to lead to kinematically similar events .",
    "we have also shown the continuum background for the same choices of parameters .",
    "the following points are worth noting .",
    "* for the choice of parameters in the table , the signal exceeds the background for @xmath56 up to somewhat beyond 300 gev , where @xmath108 decays become accessible .",
    "also , the cross section corresponds to an event rate 100 - 1000 events after cuts in a 50 @xmath76 data sample , compared to a continuum background of 50 - 100 events .",
    "* the signal efficiency varies between 5 and 10 percent depending on the model parameters ; fig .",
    "1 - 3 can thus be used to estimate the signal after the cuts .",
    "it should , of course , be kept in mind that the susy parameters are not known , and that the total background ( and signal ) rate could be considerably different ( even for similar values of @xmath139 ) from our estimate in the table .",
    "an excess of the @xmath25 events relative to the background in table i would , therefore , not enable us to cleanly infer a higgs boson signal .",
    "instead , we consider the possibility of separating the signal from the continuum background by studying the invariant mass distribution of the four leptons : for the signal , we must have @xmath140(@xmath25)@xmath141 , while the background should exhibit a rather broad distribution . since these distributions are determined by the higgs boson and neutralino masses , we expect them to be relatively insensitive to variations in model parameters which result in similar values of @xmath42 , @xmath142 and @xmath139 .    toward this end , we have shown in fig . 5 and fig . 6",
    "these distributions for the signal plus background ( solid ) and the @xmath113 continuum `` background '' ( dashed ) for the six cases in table i. for the smaller values of @xmath56 , the solid histograms are dominated by the signal and differ considerably from the dashed background histograms ( note that these are shown using a log scale ) . as anticipated above",
    ", the solid and dashed lines indeed coincide for @xmath143 . in order to decide whether the solid and dashed histograms are indeed distinguishable ,",
    "we have computed the total @xmath144 for the difference between these two histograms , _ normalized to the same number of events _ , with the event number given by the signal plus background cross section times an integrated luminosity of 50 @xmath145 . in this computation , we have used twelve 20 gev bins between @xmath146 gev and @xmath147 gev . in our simulation , we have about 1100 , 900 and 600 events for @xmath148 and 400 gev ( after cuts ) for the @xmath149 case , and about 550 events for each value of @xmath56 for @xmath150 .",
    "the resulting total @xmath144 is shown in the last column of table i. it thus appears that for @xmath151 gev , the distributions are sufficiently different that the solid line is unlikely to be a chance fluctuation of the continuum background ( for @xmath152 , this probability is smaller than 1% ) .",
    "some remarks are , however , in order :    * despite the fact that we have normalized the solid and histograms to have the same number of events , our conclusion clearly depends on the relative number of higgs initiated and continuum @xmath113 events . here",
    ", we have used the rate as given by the mssm for the values of parameters motivated by supergravity models . * for the first two cases in table i , the number of events in our simulation is comparable to the expected number in a data sample of 50 @xmath76 .",
    "we thus expect our computation of the total @xmath144 to be a reasonable reflection of the experimental situation . for the @xmath24=10 case , with @xmath153 gev ( 300 gev ) ,",
    "the signal cross section is much smaller so that about 200 @xmath76 ( 400 @xmath76 ) of integrated luminosity need to be collected in order that the fluctuations in our simulation are of comparable magnitude to those in the data .",
    "we thus conclude that while 50 @xmath76 of data may suffice to enable one to distinguish the higgs signal from continuum @xmath113 production for smaller values of @xmath24 , integrated luminosities of 200 - 400 @xmath76 may be necessary if @xmath24 is large .",
    "* we should bear in mind that we have used only the shape of the @xmath25 mass distribution to try to untangle the higgs signal from continuum @xmath113 production without any regard for rate or other event shape variables .",
    "it would be interesting to explore whether other distributions serve as better discriminators of the higgs from the continuum background .",
    "if low energy supersymmetry is to provide a rationale for the stability of the electroweak scale , sparticles must all be lighter than about 1 tev . in models where gaugino masses are unified at an ultra - high unification scale , the lighter chargino and the two lightest neutralinos are frequently lighter than 100 - 150 gev , and",
    "are thus expected to be kinematically accessible in the decays of the heavier higgs bosons of the model . in a previous paper@xcite ,",
    "we had shown within the mssm framework that these susy modes dominated the decays of the heavier neutral higgs boson , and particularly , the pseudoscalar higgs boson over a wide range of susy parameters .",
    "this has two important consequences .",
    "the down side is that it reduces the cross sections for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 or @xmath154 modes which form the usual signal for higgs bosons at hadron colliders .",
    "these susy decays , however , open up new possibilities for higgs boson detection , the most promising of which is the @xmath25 signal from the @xmath113 decays of @xmath73 or @xmath27 . here , we have improved on our previous computation of this signal , and also explored how it varies with model parameters . in this connection",
    ", we have used supergravity models as a guide in order to restrict the parameter space , and make this exploration tractable .    for the convenience of the reader , and also because the projected energy of the lhc has been reduced to 14 tev , we first briefly review the detectability of the sm decay modes of the higgs boson at the lhc . for the @xmath1 signal ,",
    "we require the center of mass scattering angle satisfy @xmath155@xcite . as before@xcite",
    ", the background is assumed to come from continuum pair production via @xmath156 where the photons have @xmath157 .",
    "for the @xmath2 and @xmath154 signal , we have required that the four leptons reconstruct to the higgs boson mass within a mass - dependent resolution given in ref.@xcite .",
    "we have considered the @xmath3 signal only for @xmath158 gev , in which case backgrounds from continuum @xmath154 and @xmath159 production have been shown to be negligible@xcite .",
    "the regions of the @xmath160 plane where these various signals are observable using the 99% cl criterion described in ref.@xcite is illustrated in fig .",
    "7 for ( _ a _ ) @xmath161 tev , and ( _ b _ ) @xmath162 gev . in this figure",
    ", we have assumed @xmath62 and taken the integrated luminosity to be 50 @xmath76 .",

    "the black region denotes the range of parameters excluded by experiments at lep@xcite while the regions below the lines marked lep190 and lep175 can be probed in experiments at lep with optimistic ( @xmath163 or @xmath164 @xmath165 , @xmath166 gev ) and pessimistic ( @xmath163 or @xmath167 @xmath165 , @xmath168 gev ) scenarios for performance of the lep collider in its next phase . we note that :    * we have used an integrated luminosity of 50 @xmath76 because at the reduced energy , we found that the @xmath169 signal was essentially unobservable over the whole plane in fig .",
    "7b with a data sample of `` just '' 30 @xmath76 .",
    "this is a reflection of the well - known fact that the position of this contour is extremely sensitive to the assumptions about the detector . *",
    "the shaded region is where none of the neutral higgs bosons of the mssm are detectable at either the lhc or at lep ii , at least via the signals discussed above .",
    "as noted in the introduction , it may be possible to detect higgs boson signals even for parameters inside this `` hole '' if higgs decays to @xmath87-leptons@xcite or bottom quark pairs@xcite are identifiable .",
    "* it is amusing to see that the shaded region actually shrinks in fig .",
    "this is somewhat misleading because this shrinkage is due to the upward movement of the lep190 curve .",
    "conservative assumptions about the performance of lep considerably increase the region where there is no signal either at lep ii , or at the lhc .",
    "we have also checked that increasing the value of the @xmath92-parameter lowers the lep 190 curve .",
    "we have traced this to an increase in @xmath170 , and the corresponding suppression of the cross section for @xmath171 production : for @xmath172 gev or @xmath173 gev , the lep 190 curve roughly follows the lep175 curve in the figure .",
    "_ thus , the  hole \" in fig .",
    "7_b _ may well be considerably bigger than indicated by the shaded region even with optimistic assumptions about the performance of lep ii .",
    "_ * we note here that the main reason for the change in the @xmath174 boundary when the parameters are altered from 1 tev to 300 gev is _ not _ the opening of the susy decays of @xmath28 .",
    "the shift occurs primarily because the higgs mass is altered ( due to the incorporation of the improved radiative corrections ) resulting in a different size of the background . *",
    "finally , we note that as anticipated , the region of parameters where the signal from two different higgs bosons is simultaneously detectable is greatly reduced for the case in fig .",
    "7b    turning to the neutralino signal for higgs bosons , the cross sections for the @xmath25 signal from @xmath113 decays of the higgs bosons are summarized in figs . 1 - 3 .",
    "we see that these cross sections can be as large as 500 @xmath59 for ranges of model parameters allowed by all known experimental data .",
    "it is also worth noting that , before experimental cuts , the signal exceeds 10 @xmath59 over a large region of parameter space where there may be no visible susy signal even at lep ii .",
    "we have argued that there are no significant sm backgrounds to this signal .",
    "thus while the detection of four lepton events at such rates will be a signal for new physics , its identification as a higgs boson signal requires that it be separable from continuum @xmath113 production for which the cross section is shown in fig .",
    "4 , for @xmath175 as expected in supergravity models .",
    "we see that over a large range of parameters , this background is significantly smaller than the signal in fig . 1 - 3 .",
    "the efficiency with which this signal may be detected is shown in table i , for cuts typical of lhc detectors .",
    "we see that this is typically 5 - 10% , so that the cross sections in fig .",
    "1 - 3 correspond to 25 - 1000 events in an experimental data sample of 50 @xmath76 .    in order to assess",
    "whether the higgs signal could be distinguished above the neutralino continuum , we examined the mass distribution of the four leptons produced via the decay of the higgs boson . for illustrative values of model parameters , we showed that the shape of this distribution may serve to discriminate the higgs signal from continuum neutralino production provided @xmath176 .",
    "we have argued that for low values of @xmath24 an integrated luminosity of 50 @xmath76 is sufficient for this discrimination , but an integrated luminosity of 200 - 400 @xmath76 is required if @xmath24 = 10 .",
    "we have , respectively , denoted these cases by crosses and open circles in fig .",
    "as we can see susy decays of higgs bosons are indeed detectable well into the `` hole '' region if lep ii is operated at about 175 gev .",
    "although this is not obvious from the figure , this may also be the case with optimistic assumptions about the performance of lep ii , since , as we mentioned the lep ii observability curve essentially follows the lep 175 curve if @xmath95 is large , while the higgs signal , is relatively insensitive to variations in @xmath29 .    in summary , we have shown that the processes @xmath177 lead to an observable rate for gold - plated four lepton events at the lhc for a significant range of susy model parameters .",
    "the parameter space region where the neutralino decays of susy higgs bosons ought to be observable can be summarized as        we have been unable to identify any significant sm background to this distinct susy higgs boson signal .",
    "we have shown that this signal may be distinguished from continuum @xmath113 production provided a sufficiently large integrated luminosity is available .",
    "finally , this process may provide the only way to identify any higgs boson of the mssm if the model parameters are in the `` hole '' region ( unless identification of their @xmath87 and bottom quark decays turns out to be feasible ) , and further , that it may well provide the only identifiable signal for the notoriously hard to detect pseudoscalar higgs boson .",
