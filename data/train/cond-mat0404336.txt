    "high - temperature superconductors are materials of type ii , that allow for partial magnetic flux penetration if the external field satisfies @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the flux penetrates the sample in the form of flux - lines ( fl s ) , each containing a quantum unit @xmath9 of flux . at low temperature the fl s form an ordered hexagonal lattice ( abrikosov lattice ) due to their their mutual repulsion .",
    "the lattice constant is given by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the magnetic field flux density .",
    "at high temperature and/or magnetic field this lattice melts due to thermal fluctuations @xcite .",
    "two of the most commonly used high - temperature superconductors are yba@xmath12cu@xmath13o@xmath14 ( ybco ) and bi@xmath12sr@xmath12cacu@xmath12o@xmath15 ( bscco ) .",
    "they are very different in one very important respect - their anisotropy parameter @xmath0 , defined as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the effective masses of electrons moving along the @xmath19 axis and the @xmath20 plane , respectively .",
    "while for ybco the anisotropy is somewhere between 5 - 7 , for bscco it is estimated to be between 10 to a 100 times larger , and estimates vary across the literature .",
    "what contributes to the discrepancy of different estimates is the fact that the anisotropy varies depending on the degree of doping .",
    "there is also the question of how to extract the value of anisotropy correctly from the exerimental results .",
    "et al _ @xcite cite a range of anisotropies of 50 - 200 for bscco .",
    "references [ ] cite values in the range of 140 - 160 . however more recent acurate measurements @xcite the components of the london penetration depths @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the ratio of which is @xmath0 , are consistent with anisotropy in the range of 300 - 500 for optimally doped samples .",
    "the previously reported lower values may belong to overdoped samples or constituted only a lower bound .",
    "anisotropy controls the amount of `` wiggling '' of a flux - line from plane to plane . in ybco",
    "the fl s are more rigid while in bscco they are so loose that they are customarily referred to as a stack of two dimensional pancakes @xcite ( or droplet vortices ) rather than fl s .",
    "interaction between two fl s in ybco is non - local .",
    "it is a screened bio - savart type of interaction where each segment of a fl interacts with every other segment of the same fl and all the other fl s . for segments oriented in the same direction",
    "the interaction is repulsive @xcite : @xmath23 here @xmath24 denotes the position of the @xmath25th fl at elevation @xmath26 along the @xmath26-axis , @xmath27 is the line energy and @xmath28 is the screening length ( penetration depth ) . considering",
    "two given fl s , it turns out though that it is a good approximation to replace the non - local interaction of a given line segment of one fl , with all segments of the other fl with a single interaction among segments belonging to the same plane .",
    "this interaction is given approximately by @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the distance between the two segments in the same plane and @xmath31 is the thickness of each layer .",
    "the approximation is valid when the fl s do not deviate too much from straight lines which is a good approximation for ybco in the `` solid '' vortex lattice phase , because fl s are stiff and do not wiggle too much .",
    "for each fl , there is also an elastic energy associated with its deviation from a straight line along the @xmath26-direction .",
    "the elastic energy of a flux - line in ybco is approximately given by @xmath32 assuming the external magnetic field is aligned along the z - direction .",
    "the elastic coefficient ( line tension ) @xmath33 is equal to @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the coherence length , and @xmath0 is the anisotropy . in the discrete case",
    "this self - energy transforms into an attractive quadratic interaction between segments in adjacent planes . in this form",
    "the problem is equivalent to a system of bosons with repulsive interactions @xcite .",
    "the term described in the last equation corresponds to the kinetic energy of the bosons which repel each other with a screened coulomb interaction .    for bscco",
    "the situation is different because each fl is represented more faithfully by a collection of pancakes .",
    "each pancake interacts with every other pancake , but the interaction is different from the interaction among fl segments discussed above . the interaction can be shown to consist of two parts . the first part is called the electromagnetic interaction ( or simply magnetic ) and it exists even in the case that the layers of the materials are completely decoupled , so no current can flow along the @xmath19-axis of the sample .",
    "a pancake vortex located in one plane gives rise to screening currents in the same plane as well as in all other planes .",
    "a second pancake vortex , located elsewhere , interacts with the screening currents induced by the first pancake @xcite .",
    "this interaction has been calculated by clem and others @xcite .",
    "two pancakes in the same plane interact with a repulsive interaction while pancakes in different planes attract one another .",
    "if one considers a single pancake vortex and an infinite set of pancakes a distance @xmath36 away stacked along the @xmath26-axis , then the interaction still sums to @xmath37 in the limit when @xmath38 goes to zero ( see appendix a ) .",
    "clem @xcite proceeds to show that if one has a straight array of pancake vortices along the @xmath26-axis , and one pancake of the stack is displaced a distance @xmath36 in the lateral direction then the magnetic energy of the configuration increases by an amount @xmath39 where @xmath40 is euler s constant ( = 0.5772 ... ) . for large @xmath36 ( @xmath41 ) ,",
    "the modified bessel function @xmath7 decays exponentially and thus the energy increases like @xmath42 . for small @xmath36 the bessel function",
    "can be expanded in a power series in @xmath43 @xmath44 and thus the electromagnetic energy behaves like @xmath45 to leading order in @xmath36 .",
    "the second part of the interaction among pancake vortices is the so - called josephson interaction @xcite .",
    "it results from the fact that there is a josephson current flowing between two superconductors separated by an insulator and this current is proportional to the sine of the phase difference of the superconducting wave functions .",
    "the superconductors in the present case are the different cuo@xmath12 planes .",
    "when two pancakes belonging to the same stack and residing in adjacent planes move away from each other , the phase difference that originates causes a josephson current to begin flowing between the planes .",
    "this results in an attractive interaction between pancakes that for distances small compared to @xmath46 is approximately quadratic @xcite in the distance . when the two adjacent pancakes are separated by a distance larger than @xmath47 ,",
    "a `` josephson string '' is formed , whose energy is proportional to its length @xcite .",
    "when the anisotropy is not too large , the josephson coupling among adjacent pancakes , which are loosely belonging to the same `` flux - line '' , dominates over the electromagnetic interaction , and the later can be neglected .",
    "the ratio of the coefficients of the quadratic terms in the effective electromagnetic interaction ( as mentioned above ) and the josephson interaction goes roughly like @xmath48 ( where @xmath49 for bscco at @xmath50 and even smaller at higher temperatures ) .",
    "thus for anisotropy @xmath51 we get a factor of 0.25 or less ( a somewhat more precise estimate @xcite gives a ratio of about 0.1 ) .",
    "thus the magnetic interaction is small compared to the josephson interaction for anisotropies in the range of @xmath52 . for samples with @xmath53 these interactions are already comparable . for large values of @xmath36",
    "the magnetic interaction increases logarithmically and the josephson interaction increases linearly so the electromagnetic interaction is always negligible .",
    "the key to the estimate given above is to consider not just two pancake vortices but a whole line with one displaced pancake .",
    "this argument is valid if the deviations of the vortices from straight lines are not too large . on the other hand ,",
    "the electromagnetic interaction starts to be important for anisotropies which are significantly larger than @xmath54 which for bscco is about 120 .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to include both the electromagnetic interaction and the josephson interaction among pancakes and to see what is the combined effect on the phase diagram of the melting transition and the energy jump across the transition .",
    "the electromagnetic interaction will be included fully in the sense that we will not make the approximation that the pancake stacks are nearly straight and hence the electromagnetic coupling will not be replaced by an in - plane effective coupling .",
    "numerically , much of the past work on bscco has been confined to the x - y model @xcite and bose model @xcite , both of them treat the electromagnetic coupling imprecisely by including it as an effective in - plane interaction . recently in several papers using the langevin simulation method @xcite , the electromagnetic coupling has been fully taken into account .",
    "unfortunately , these papers completely neglect the josephson coupling which can hardly be justified .",
    "also some of these papers work with a small system size like @xmath55 to @xmath56 planes along the z - direction , and some do not even use periodic boundary conditions in the z - direction . in this paper",
    "we carry out monte carlo simulations of a bscco system consisting of @xmath57 planes and periodic boundary conditions are used in all directions , including the @xmath26 direction .",
    "thus a pancake would interact with an infinite number of pancakes through the images under the periodic boundary conditions . for this an efficient way to sum over the interaction",
    "is required .",
    "we derive a formula for summing over the logarithmic interaction in appendix b.",

    "( [ ldmodel ] ) to obtain the gibbs free - energy , and thus the strength of the interaction among pancake solutions .",
    "we also see that in the limit of infinite anisotropy the right - hand - side of equations ( [ josephson1 ] ) and ( [ ff1 ] ) tend to zero .",
    "an isolated pancake residing in plane @xmath76 is a singular solution of the equation for the phase of the wave function which satisfies @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a two dimensional vector in the plane and @xmath84 denotes the center of the pancake . by @xmath85",
    "we denote a unit vector in the z - direction .",
    "thus as one fully encircles the pancake the phase @xmath86 changes by @xmath87 , and is singular at the center of the pancake . in the case",

    "this transformation can only be implemented approximately . in the following",
    "we first summarize the known results for the josephson interaction and the electromagnetic interaction and then proceed to combine them together into a single algorithm .",
    "most papers consider only one type of interaction , josephson or electromagnetic in the limit that one dominates over the other .",
    "we keep the same josephson coupling as in ref . .",
    "this coupling is strongly dependent on the anisotropy parameter @xmath0 .",
    "consider two adjacent pancakes , belonging to the same fl , residing in the @xmath90 and @xmath91 planes respectively , such that their centers are displaced and not located on top of each other .",
    "assume that the pancake on the @xmath92th plane is located on top of the @xmath91-plane pancake , and the pancake residing in the @xmath93 plane is at the same position as the @xmath90-plane pancake .",

    "when the separation between the centers of the two pancakes becomes larger than @xmath47 then a josephson string is formed between the @xmath90th and the @xmath91th planes in a direction parallel to the planes .",
    "the energy of the josephson string is proportional to its length which is equal to @xmath36 , the pancakes separation .",

    "there are ways to improve the extrapolation @xcite but they do not change significantly the results of the simulations performed using the rddk formula .",

    "the position of a pancake is specified in terms of cylindrical coordinates .",

    "the index @xmath25 labels the fl that the pancake is a part of .",
    "we have considered only pancakes belonging to the same fl .",
    "this is because for large separations by definition the josephson string is formed among pancakes belonging to the same fl .",
    "we do check for the energy of all nearest neighboring pairs when deciding how to connect pancakes and we allow the process of flux `` cutting '' and switching . in the case that pancakes belonging to different fl s approach each other to a distance much smaller than @xmath47 , than there will be an interaction of the form of eq .",

    "each one of these rhombic units cells also repeats itself every @xmath139 plane due to the periodic boundary condition in @xmath26 direction as well .",
    "thus we have periodic boundary conditions in all directions .",

    "we work with two system sizes to safeguard against any possibile finite size effects . while working with @xmath141 we chose @xmath142 in most cases , except for @xmath143 g and @xmath144 , where the number of planes was increased from 25 to 36 . for low fields and anisotropies the entanglement length along the _",
    "c _ axis becomes large , and hence in order to observe a sharp transition a larger system size in the z - direction is needed .",
    "similarly , for @xmath145 pancakes in each plane , we usually work with a total of 20 , 25 or 36 planes depending on the values of parameter @xmath11 and @xmath0 . in all the cases considered in this paper",
    "we always had a total of at least 900 beads ( @xmath141 , @xmath142 ) and a maximum of 2304 beads ( @xmath146 , @xmath147 ) .",

    "which method to employ in a particular case usually depends upon the anisotropy and the magnetic field , as described below .    for most anisotropies and magnetic fields ,",
    "the mmc technique was used . in mmc",
    "we update several pancakes spread over many planes at once .",
    "thus for the lower anisotropies @xmath148 and 150 , and @xmath143 g , a total of @xmath149 to @xmath150 beads spread over @xmath55 planes were used to update the system . for other anisotropies and fields ( @xmath151 and @xmath152 g ) it suffices to use just 3 planes in the mmc technique .",
    "for different parameter ranges , one needs to use different methods of updating the fl s .",
    "for example , one can not use mmc method for @xmath6 since there is no natural choice to generate paths sampled with a free gaussian distribution . even at higher values of @xmath0 , such as 500 , the mmc method using 5 planes would be slow and inefficient .",
    "thus for @xmath153 and @xmath154 , we move only one pancake at a time using the metropolis algorithm .",
    "flux cutting was implemented by using a different kind of move to allow for the large wiggling of the fl s ( and thus to avoid bias towards straighter fl configurations ) . in this move",
    "the two ends of neighboring lines were switched by considering only the relevant josephson interactions without attempting to displace any of the pancakes involved .",
    "just like the case with high anisotropies discussed above , in the mmc implementation also we allowed for large wiggling of fl s along the @xmath26-direction by introducing the process of flux cutting .",
    "starting from a few neighboring lines , we cut chunks of fl s spreading over a number of planes .",
    "new paths between the starting and ending positions of the fl s thus cut were made using a random walk through the space of permutations @xcite and the subsequent use of the bisection method @xcite .",
    "of course there are ranges of parameters where more than one method of update can be employed ( e.g. metropolis method , mmc with 3 planes or mmc with 5 planes . ) . in these cases of overlap ,",
