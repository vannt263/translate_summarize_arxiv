    "lighting technology has evolved rapidly in the past decade , enabling replacement of inefficient incandescent light bulbs with compact fluorescent lights ( cfls ) and light - emitting diodes ( leds ) .",
    "the figure of merit for the energy efficiency of lighting is _ luminous efficacy _ , measured in lumens per watt .",
    "inefficiency can be separated into two main forms : inefficient production of photons from the input power source ; and distribution of photons outside of the visible spectrum .",
    "for example , incandescent lights are marvelously efficient at generating photons from the input electrical source , but produce the vast majority of these photons at near - infrared wavelengths where the human eye has no sensitivity .",
    "we can break the total luminous efficacy into spectral and electrical components , so that @xmath0 .",
    "the spectral part , @xmath1 carries units of lm / w , while the electrical part , @xmath2 is unitless , representing the ratio of luminous power output to electrical power input .",
    "this paper focuses on the spectral distribution aspect of lighting efficiency , and will not address the efficiency with which photons are produced .",
    "a monochromatic source at 555  nm  the peak of the photopic sensitivity curve @xcite  will produce 683  lm / w of light output @xcite .",
    "for other monochromatic wavelengths , the luminous efficacy is reduced by a factor according to the photopic function .",
    "for instance , at the 633  nm wavelength of helium - neon lasers , the sensitivity of the eye is only 23.5% compared to its peak value ( leading to 160 lm / w ) , whereas the human eye has 88.5% sensitivity at the 532  nm wavelength of frequency - doubled nd : yag lasers , corresponding to an efficacy of 604 lm / w .    but monochromatic illumination  as efficient as it might be  is often deemed to be unacceptable , providing no color differentiation .",
    "even a composite of several line sources that may appear white - like can inadequately render some colored items , as can often be the case under the line - dominated spectrum of fluorescent lights .",
    "sporadic instances in the literature @xcite place the maximum luminous efficacy for white light in the range of 250300  lm / w without reference to supporting material .",
    "some papers ( e.g. , @xcite ) display the appropriate integral along with a numerical result , but without detailing the integration limits or the specifics of the integrand .",
    "uchida & taguchi @xcite estimate the theoretical luminous efficacy of a white led with good color rendering to be @xmath3  lm / w .",
    "coltrin et al .",
    "@xcite found that it is theoretically possible to synthesize a light achieving 408  lm / w with a color rendering index in excess of 90 using four discrete wavelengths .",
    "but in practice the color rendering becomes unacceptable when the fluxes of the individual line sources are allowed to vary from the design by a standard deviation of 10% , facing the additional hurdle that the requisite narrow - line sources are not easily obtained .",
    "yun - li et al .",
    "@xcite explored combinations of led lights to synthesize white light , finding that luminous efficacies in excess of 300  lm / w and suitable color rendering could be achieved with three leds .",
    "none of these previous estimates are in error , but nor do they represent a comprehensive study of the limits to spectral luminous efficacy as a function of the quality characteristics of the light .    in this paper , we examine the theoretical limits to ( spectral ) luminous efficacy for lights that we would perceive as white , to varying degrees .",
    "we find that the maximum efficacy is in the range of 250370  lm / w , and that the color temperature of the light has only a modest impact within the range of values typically encountered .",
    "we explore lighting performance as a function of both the bandpass associated with a minimum threshold , and as a function of color temperature .",
    "we also evaluate the maximum luminous efficacy as a function of color rendering index . finally , we look at the spectral luminous efficacy of a variety of modern light sources . for what follows ,",
    "references to luminous efficacy are to be interpreted as spectral luminous efficacy unless explicitly noted otherwise .",
    "to assess the theoretical limits of spectral luminous efficacy , we integrate the normalized spectral density function , @xmath4 , in fractional luminous power per meter ( of wavelength ) , times the photopic sensitivity curve @xcite of the eye , @xmath5 , which lies between 0.0 and 1.0 , peaking at @xmath6  nm : @xmath7 the factor of 683 in front scales the result in accordance with the definition for the lumen .",
    "the function , @xmath5 , peaks at a value of 1.0 at @xmath8  nm .",
    "the sun is our standard `` white '' light source , and is well approximated by a planck blackbody at the sun s surface temperature of 5800  k. the planck function ",
    "normalized so that the integral over all wavelengths is unity  is : @xmath9 ^{-1}\\,\\,\\mathrm{m^{-1}},\\label{eq : planck}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is wavelength , @xmath11 is planck s constant , @xmath12 is the speed of light , @xmath13 is boltzman s constant , and @xmath14 is the blackbody temperature , in kelvin .",
    "a blackbody at the temperature of the sun results in a luminous efficacy of @xmath15  lm / w .",
    "only 37% of its light falls within the visible band from 400  nm to 700  nm . by comparison",
    ", a light bulb at 2800  k has a luminous efficacy  determined in the manner above  of 15  lm / w , with 6% of its light in the 400700  nm band .",
    "[ fig : planck ] shows the luminous efficacy as a function of blackbody temperature , peaking at 6640  k and 96.1  lm / w . as a caveat that does not impact the conclusions of this paper",
    ", we note that actual tungsten filaments achieve 15  lm / w at lower temperatures around 2500  k  being imperfect blackbodies that selectively emit light in the visible compared to the infrared part of the spectrum .    ]    to evaluate the color rendering performance of each source , we compute the correlated color temperature ( cct ) , offset from `` white , '' and color rendering index ( cri ) for the spectra considered herein  following the procedure outlined by the international commission on illumination ( cie ) @xcite . in brief , the procedure involves establishing the chromatic coordinates of the source within the international commission on illumination ( known as the cie ) 1960 @xmath16 color space , and relating this to the chromatic locus of points corresponding to blackbody radiation profiles .",
    "the cct is the closest blackbody temperature in color space , and the pythagorean distance between the points indicates how `` white '' the source looks ( @xmath17 is considered to be too far for the cri computation to be reliable ) . establishing the cri is substantially more involved , and is based on comparing a standard set of 8 munsell colors under illumination by both the spectrum under study and by a blackbody at the cct  ultimately forming the offset metric in the cie 1964 @xmath18 color space .",
    "the cri ranges from 0100 , with values above 90 typically considered to be adequate for general lighting .",
    "the cri as calculated in this way is a flawed construct , but nonetheless is in common practice and is used here for comparative purposes .    if we construct a _ truncated _",
    "5800  k blackbody so that it emits light only in the range between cutoff wavelengths @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the luminous efficacy is now given by : @xmath21 and evaluates to 251  lm / w for a 5800  k blackbody truncated to emit light only between @xmath22  nm and @xmath23  nm .",
    "this describes one manifestation of the ideal white light , which might in principle be synthesized out of narrow emission sources , such as leds , over a range of wavelengths .",
    "more sensible would be to base the @xmath19 and @xmath20 limits on human photopic sensitivity levels , rather than on the arbitrary  although convenient400  nm and 700  nm values . for the analysis in this paper , we principally concentrate on the part of the photopic response that lies above 0.5% , 1% , 2% , and 5% of peak sensitivity .",
    "these threshold levels correspond to @xmath19 values of 405.7 , 413.2 , 422.3 , and 453.2  nm , respectively , and to @xmath20 values of 697.0 , 687.4 , 677.4 , and 663.2  nm , respectively .",
    "[ fig : curves ] illustrates these ranges in relation to the photopic sensitivity curve , together with blackbody curves at 2800  k and 5800  k for reference .    ]",
    "using the four principal wavelength ranges discussed above , the ideal luminous efficacy for light following a 5800  k spectrum computes to @xmath24 , 274 , 292 , and 348  lm / w , corresponding to 0.5% , 1% , 2% , and 5% sensitivity thresholds , respectively . tab .",
    "[ tab : truncated ] lists additional properties of these truncated spectra , together with two other cases .",
    "the results are rather similar for a truncated 2800  k source .",
    "we see in tab .  [",
    "tab : truncated ] some justification for stopping at a 5% photopic cutoff , as the cri for these cases abruptly enters a region considered to be unacceptable in the lighting industry .",
    "perhaps more importantly , the @xmath25@xmath26 chromaticity offset for these cases exceeds the threshold of @xmath27 , and therefore would no longer be considered `` white . '' it should be noted that the cri is not customarily compared among sources with differing color temperatures .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     another case presented in tab .",
    "[ tab : truncated ] is that of a truncated spectrally uniform light source , with constant @xmath4 across the range from @xmath19 to @xmath20 , and no light outside of this range .",
    "for the four principal sensitivities examined here , the uniform case delivers 253 , 268 , 287 , and 344  lm / w .",
    "these numbers are very similar to the blackbody cases considered above .",
    "it is interesting that the planckian offset ( departure from `` white '' ) and the cri initially improve as the photopic cutoff increases .",
    "the uniform spectrum is red- and blue - heavy compared to a 5800  k blackbody , so that increasing truncation initially compensates this overabundance of light at the extremes . all the same , by the time one",
    "reaches a 5% photopic cutoff , the light is no longer acceptable , either in terms of planckian offset or cri .",
    "we have become accustomed to incandescent lighting , and have developed some affinity for the `` warm '' color temperatures they emit . a daylight spectrum presented at night",
    "may be perceived as jarring and harsh . investigating",
    "the maximum luminous efficacy for lights of different color temperatures reveals a surprise  perhaps partly exposed by the similarity of numbers in the two blackbody and uniform spectral density cases above .",
    "the maximum luminous efficacy in a truncated spectral source is largely independent of color temperature , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : eff - trunc ] .    .",
    "stars mark the efficacies at 5800  k. [ fig : eff - trunc ] ]    between color temperatures of 25008000  k , the maximum luminous efficacy for a particular spectral cutoff varies by less than 10% .",
    "it is interesting to ascertain the maximum efficacy achievable as a function of sensitivity threshold , as well as the temperature at which maximum efficacy is realized . the result is presented in fig .  [ fig : max_eff ] .",
    "the reversal in peak color temperature as the photopic cutoff increases beyond about 3% can be seen as a result of the flattening curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : eff - trunc ] .",
    "the maximum of each curve first shifts toward lower color temperatures as the photopic cutoff increases , but then the curves begin to flatten at high color temperatures , pushing the maximum to higher temperatures .",
    "the break seen at 6% in both panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : max_eff ] relates to the point at which the blue tail of the photopic curve abruptly transitions to a higher slope .",
    "relaxing the constraint that @xmath19 and @xmath20 be determined by symmetric thresholds on the photopic sensitivity curves , we can ask what combination of @xmath19 and @xmath20 delivers the maximum luminous efficacy as a function of achieved cri . for instance",
    ", we can demand a cri of 95 and seek the highest @xmath1 that can result from a blackbody function truncated by arbitrary @xmath19 and @xmath20 . fig .  [",
    "fig : max58 ] shows the result for a truncated 5800  k blackbody .",
    "the planckian offset exceeds @xmath28 for cri values below @xmath29 , at which point the spectral luminous efficacy is @xmath30  lm / w .",
    "exploring what this means in terms of wavelength cutoff , we find that the maximum luminous efficacy favors sacrificing red light sooner than giving up blue ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : max58 ] ) . in this case , the blue cutoff is at 423  nm , corresponding to 2.1% photopic sensitivity .",
    "meanwhile , the red cutoff is at 658.5  nm , or a photopic sensitivity of 6.7% .",
    "similar trends are found for a truncated 2800  k spectrum , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : max28]except that the light remains `` white '' at a lower cri , pushing the luminous efficacy up to @xmath31  lm / w , sacrificing even more red light in the red - tilted spectrum",
    ".    exploring one final scenario , one may be tempted to match a light source to the photopic sensitivity curve , because not much light would be `` wasted '' at wavelengths to which the human eye is not sensitive .",
    "such a source can be approximated by a gaussian curve centered at 560  nm and a full width at half - maximum of 100  nm .",
    "this light would deliver a luminous efficacy of 488  lm / w , but would look distinctly green , being similar in light distribution to that of green led , albeit with a broader spectrum .",
    "in particular , the planckian offset is 0.054 , and the cri computes to 24 : a grossly inadequate source of white light .",
    "we can evaluate today s sources of alternative lighting by acquiring spectral distributions and computing the corresponding spectral luminous efficacy .",
    "this technique does not address the efficiency with which electrical power input is converted to luminous energy , @xmath2 , but simply evaluates the efficacy stemming from the distribution , @xmath1 .",
    "spectra were obtained using the usb2000 spectrometer from ocean optics , capturing 12-bit raw data at a spectral resolution between 400500 and sampling ranging from 0.38  nm at the uv end to 0.28  nm at the ir end .",
    "spectra are dark - subtracted and calibrated against a solar spectrum acquired by the same setup that itself is fitted to a 5800  k planck function , avoiding absorption features from the solar and terrestrial atmospheres in the fitting procedure .",
    "luminous efficacies are evaluated in the range from 400900  nm , which does not catch 100% of the light in all cases ( and would be a poor choice for blackbody sources ) , but captures the vast majority of the light output for the sources presented here .",
    "[ fig : cfl - spectra ] shows the spectrum of a 16  w compact fluorescent light rated at 900  lm as it appears seconds after turn - on from an ambient temperature state and after settling in a warm equilibrium .",
    "the luminous efficacy of the spectral distribution evolves from 283  lm / w to 349  lm / w as many of the infrared lines disappear and the green line achieves greater relative dominance . in the process ,",
    "the planckian offset exceeds the acceptable limit , and the cri is well short of the target of 90 . at @xmath32",
    "lm / w and @xmath33  lm / w , the inferred electricity - to - light ratio is @xmath3416% .",
    "[ fig : led - spectra ] illustrates the spectral distributions of two lights using similar total electrical power and based on the same blue led , but using different phosphors at differing levels of absorption to achieve advertised color temperatures of 3000  k and 6500  k. the spectral distributions achieve luminous efficacies of 341  lm / w and r287lm / w , respectively .",
    "while both lights closely bracket the acceptable planckian offset , neither have a high cri  especially the 3000  k light .",
    "the 3000  k light is rated at 86  lm , implying an electrical - to - light efficiency of @xmath3417% .",
    "[ fig : lcd - spectra ] presents spectra from the white background of two different laptop computer displays backlit by fluorescent tubes and leds , achieving spectral luminous efficacies of 317  lm / w and 293  lm / w , respectively .",
    "the spectra differ qualitatively from their lighting counterparts , chiefly in their use of phosphors .",
    "spectra were also acquired for an led - illuminated television , scoring 283  lm / w and appearing qualitatively identical to the spectrum of the led computer display .",
    "each of the displayed spectra have reasonably small planckian offsets , and the cri values are substantially higher than for the lighting counterparts in figs .",
    "[ fig : cfl - spectra ] and [ fig : led - spectra ] .",
    "each of these sources  by confining emission to the visible parts of the spectrum  are capable of far better spectral luminous efficacies than are incandescent sources .",
    "each of the spectra presented here land within the range of 250350  lm / w , despite vastly different spectral distributions . for clarity",
    ", these lights do not achieve total luminous efficacies above 100  lm / w due to inefficiencies in the _ generation _ of photons .",
    "given that all of the measured spectra in figs .",
    "[ fig : cfl - spectra][fig : lcd - spectra ] yield spectral efficacies in the 280350  lm / w range , we infer that generation efficiencies above about @xmath35 in lights sharing similar spectra will naturally deliver overall luminous efficacies above 100  lm / w .",
    "synthesizing a white light source that emits no light outside the visible band can achieve luminous efficacies in a range between 250370  lm / w depending on spectral extent and corresponding  whiteness . \"",
    "one approaches the upper end of this range when truncating the spectrum at the 5% photopic sensitivity limits of the eye , generating light only between 453663  nm .",
    "but at this cutoff , the light is already inadequate in terms of color rendering index and planckian offset . by accepting asymmetric cutoffs , we are able to achieve adequate color properties at @xmath30  lm / w for a color temperature of 5800  k , and @xmath36  lm / w at 2800  k. at the high - quality end , it is unlikely that any white - light application for humans would require illumination at the very low end of the photopic sensitivity curve , below 0.5% ( corresponding to wavelength cutoffs at 406 and 697  nm ) , so that 250  lm / w can be taken as the lower bound to maximum practical luminous efficacy of a white source .",
    "unlike the pure blackbody , which achieves a maximum luminous efficacy around 6640  k , a truncated source performs best between 35004100  k. even so , the spectral efficacy is relatively constant ( within 10% ) across color temperatures ranging from 25008000  k for a given set of truncation bounds .",
    "similarly , lower color temperatures produce higher spectral luminous efficacies under asymmetric cutoff wavelengths .",
    "leaving aside the efficiency with which photons are generated , any real white - like spectrum confining itself to visible wavelengths is likely to achieve a _",
    "spectral _ luminous efficacy in the range of 250350  lm / w , as is demonstrated by a wide variety of sources above .",
    "this fact emphasizes that improvements in the efficacy of current lighting technology must primarily involve advances in photon generation efficiency rather than spectral conditioning .",
