    "agent - based models ( abms ) are an attempt to understand how macroscopic regularities may emerge through processes of self - organization in systems of interacting agents .",
    "one of the main purposes of this modeling strategy is to shed light on the fundamental principles of self - organized complexity in adaptive multi - level systems in order to gain an insight into the microscopic conditions and mechanisms responsible for the temporal and spatial patterns observed at aggregate levels .",
    "therefore , abms are sometimes considered as a methodology to provide a > > theoretical bridge < < ( @xcite:148 ) between micro and macro theories ( see also @xcite ) .    while used as a tool in economics , sociology , ecology and other disciplines , abms are often criticized for being tractable only by simulation .",
    "this paper addresses this issue by applying markov chain and information - theoretic tools to a particular abm with the specific objective to better understand the transition from the most informative agent level to the levels at which the system behavior is typically observed .",
    "a well posed mathematical basis for linking a micro - description of a model to a macro - description may help the understanding of many of the observed properties and therefore provide information about the transition from the interaction between individual entities to the complex macroscopic behaviors observed at the global level .    for this purpose",
    ", the paper draws upon a recently introduced markov chain framework for aggregation in agent - based and related computational models ( see @xcite and also @xcite ) .",
    "the starting point is a microscopic markov chain description of the dynamical process in complete correspondence with the dynamical behavior of the agent model , which is obtained by considering the set of all possible agent configurations @xmath0 as the state space of a huge markov chain  an idea borrowed from @xcite .",
    "namely , if we consider an abm in which @xmath1 agents can be in @xmath2 different states this leads to a markov chain with @xmath3 states .",
    "moreover , in models with sequential update by which one agent is chosen to update its state at a time , transitions are only allowed between system configurations that differ with respect to a single agent .",
    "such an explicit micro formulation enables the application of the theory of markov chain aggregation  namely , lumpability @xcite  in order to reduce the state space of the micro chain and relate microscopic descriptions to a macroscopic formulation of interest @xcite .",
    "namely , when performing simulations of an abm we are actually not interested in all the dynamical details , but rather in the behavior of certain macro - level properties that inform us about the global state of the system . in opinion dynamics , and in binary opinion models in particular , the typical level of observation is the number of agents in the different opinion states or respectively the average opinion ( due to the analogy to spin systems often called > > magnetization < < ) .",
    "the explicit formulation of abms as markov chains enables the development of a mathematical framework to link a micro chain corresponding to an abm to such a macro - level description of interest .",
    "more precisely , from the markov chain perspective , the transition from the micro to the macro level is a projection of the micro chain with state space @xmath0 onto a new state space @xmath4 by means of a ( projection ) map @xmath5 from @xmath6 to @xmath4 .",
    "the meaning of the projection @xmath5 is to lump sets of micro configurations in @xmath6 into an aggregate set according to the macro property of interest .",
    "such a situation naturally arises if the abm is observed not at the micro level of @xmath0 , but rather in terms of a measure @xmath7 on @xmath0 by which all configuration in @xmath0 that give rise to the same measurement are mapped into the same macro state , say @xmath8 .",
    "an illustration of such a projection is provided in fig .",
    "[ fig : projectiongeneral ] .    ) is observed ( @xmath7 ) at a higher level and this observation defines another macro level process ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the micro process is a markov chain with transition matrix @xmath10 .",
    "the macro process is a markov chain ( with @xmath11 ) only in the case of lumpability . ]",
    "two things may happen by projecting the microscopic markov chain onto a coarser partition .",
    "first , the macro process is still a markov chain which is the case of lumpability @xcite .",
    "then markov chain tools can be used to compute the dynamical quantities of interest and a precise understanding of the model behavior is possible .",
    "as shown in @xcite this depends essentially on the symmetries implemented in the model .",
    "secondly , markovianity may be lost after the projection which means that memory effects are introduced at the macroscopic level .",
    "noteworthy , in abms as well as more generally in markov chains , this situation is the rule rather than an exception @xcite .",
    "while the first part of this paper derives exact markov chain description for the complete and a perfect two  community graph , and the second part of this paper is devoted to the study of the non - markovian case .    for these purposes",
    ", the explicit construction of an abm s microscopic transition kernel is a necessary starting point because it helps , on the one hand , to establish the conditions for which the macro - level process remains markovian ( i.e. , lumpability ) , and enables , on the other hand , the use of information - theoretic measures for the `` closedness '' of an aggregate description .",
    "a series of measures  among them conditional past - future mutual information @xcite and micro - to - macro information flow @xcite  have been developed to quantify the deviations from an idealized description which models the dynamics of the system by the state variables associated to a coarser level .",
    "see also @xcite for the mathematical analysis of the relation between different levels of description in complex multi - level systems . in our context , this allows for a quantification of the memory effects that are introduced by a global aggregation over the agent population without sensitivity to micro- or mesoscopic structures which presents a first step to study how microscopic heterogeneity in abms may lead to macroscopic complexity when the aggregation procedure defines a non - markovian macro process . to my knowledge , this paper is the first to apply these concepts to an abm .    in this paper the contrarian voter model ( cvm )",
    "is used as a first simple scenario .",
    "the cvm is a binary opinion model where @xmath1 agents placed on a network can adopt two different opinions : @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in the pure voter model @xcite",
    "two agents are chosen at random and they align in the interaction because one of them imitates the other . as in other binary models of opinion dynamics",
    "( see @xcite for two well - known variants and @xcite for an overview ) this mechanism of local alignment leads to a system which converges to a final profile of global conformity ( consensus ) in which all agent share the same opinion .",
    "contrarian behavior , then , relates to the presence of individuals that do not seek conformity under all circumstances or to the existence of certain situations in which agents would not desire to adopt the behavior or attitude of their interaction partner . in the cvm",
    "studied here contrarian behavior is included by introducing a small probability @xmath14 with which agents to not imitate their interaction partner , but adopt precisely the opposite opinion .",
    "there are several different ways to include nonconformity behavior into a binary opinion model and the approach adopted here is probably the most simple one . in our choice",
    ", we basically follow ref .",
    "@xcite which , based on the concept of contrarian investment strategies in finance @xcite , is the first study to introduce contrarian behavior into a model of opinion dynamics ( namely , into galam s majority model ) .",
    "while the majority model without contrarians is characterized by a relatively fast convergence to complete consensus , the introduction of only a small rate of contrarian choices leads to the coexistence of the two opinions with a clear majority - minority splitting .",
    "noteworthy , as the contrarian rate increases further , the model exhibits a phase transition to a disordered phase in which no opinion dominates in the population .",
    "similar observations have been made for the sznajd model @xcite .",
    "more recently the literature often distinguishes between two types of nonconformity : ( i. ) anti - conformity or contrarian behavior and ( ii . ) independent or inflexible agents @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for opinion models that include independent or inflexible agents .",
    "the importance of a distinction between individuals that generally oppose the group norm or act independently of it is , from the socio - psychological perspective , relatively obvious .",
    "the fact that these two behaviors may also give rise to qualitatively different dynamical properties , however , has been established only recently @xcite . here",
    "we stick to contrarians .",
    "the voter model with contrarians presented in @xcite is probably the one that relates most to the model used here .",
    "the main difference is that a fixed number of agents always acts in a contrarian way whereas in the present model all agents take contrarian choices with a small probability @xmath14 . in that setting",
    ", @xcite could not observe the phase transition from majority - minority splitting to disorder , but rather a change from a uniform to a gaussian equilibrium distribution .",
    "while this difference in comparison with the sznajd and galam models has been attributed to the linearity of the cvm in @xcite , this study shows that there is in fact an order - disorder phase transition in the cvm as well .",
    "however , the ordered phase can be observed only below a very small contrarian rate of @xmath15 at which the equilibrium distribution is uniform ( see sec .",
    "[ cha:5.hmstatdyn ] ) , in accordance with @xcite . in the setting of @xcite with a fixed number of contrarian agents , however , this value is already reached , on average , with only a single contrarian , independent of the population size .",
    "notice , finally , that the complete graph plays an exceptional role for the analytical treatment of nonconformity models commended on above . from the markovian point of view",
    ", this is due to the fact that for the complete graph binary opinion models are lumpable  that is reducible without loss of information  to a macroscopic description in terms of the average opinion or > > magnetization < < @xcite .",
    "this paper analyses the complete graph as well , but it goes beyond it by studying the cvm on a perfect two  community graph . in that case , a loss - less macro description is obtained by taking into account separately the average opinion in the two sub - graphs , that is , by a refinement of the level of observation . alongside with the analysis of the respective model dynamics , these two cases allow to address some very interesting questions concerning the relation between the two coarse - grainings .",
    "for instance , it is possible to illustrate why lumpability ( in its strong as well as in its weak form ) fails for the two  community graph .",
    "moreover , looking at the two - community scenario from the global perspective of total > > magnetization",
    "< < allows for the exact computation of memory effects that emerge at the macroscopic level .",
    "the sequel of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "[ cha:5.cvm ] introduces the cvm and derives the corresponding microscopic markov chain .",
    "[ cha:5.hmand2com ] deals with the model on the complete and the two - community graph with a particular focus on the stationary dynamics of the model .",

    "[ cha:5.networkdynamics ] shows the effect of various paradigmatic networks on the macroscopic stationary behavior . in sec .",
    "[ cha:5.micromesomacro ] we return to the two - community cvm and find with it an analytical scenario to study the discrepancy between a mean - field model ( homogeneous mixing ) and the model on a more complex ( though still very simple ) topology .",
    "it shows that memory effects are introduced at the macro level when we aggregate over agent attributes without sensitivity to the microscopic details .",
    "the cvm is a binary opinion model where @xmath1 agents can adopt two different opinions : @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the model is an extension of the voter model ( vm ) in order to include a form of contrarian behavior . at each step , an agent ( @xmath17 ) is chosen at random along with one of its neighbors ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "usually ( with probability @xmath19 ) , @xmath17 imitates @xmath18 ( vm rule ) , but there is also a small probability @xmath14 that agent @xmath17 will do the opposite ( contrarian extension ) . more specifically ,",
    "if @xmath17 holds opinion @xmath13 and meets an agent @xmath18 in @xmath12 , @xmath17 will change to @xmath12 with probability @xmath19 , and will maintain its current state @xmath13 with probability @xmath14 . likewise ,",
    "if @xmath17 and @xmath18 are in the same state , @xmath17 will flip to the opposite state with probability @xmath14 .      from the micro - level perspective , the cvm implements an update function of the form @xmath20 . for further convenience",
    ", we denote the current state of an agent @xmath17 by @xmath21 and the updated state at time @xmath22 as @xmath23 .",
    "the map @xmath24 can then be written as @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the opposite attribute of @xmath27 . in each iteration ,",
    "two agents @xmath28 are chosen along with a random variable @xmath29 that decides whether the voter ( @xmath30 ) or the contrarian rule ( @xmath31 ) is performed .",
    "the probability for that is @xmath32 .",
    "notice that the update rule is equal for all agents and independent from the agent choice .",
    "therefore the probability that an agent pair @xmath33 is chosen to perform the contrarian rule can be written as @xmath34 . respectively",
    ", we have @xmath35 for the vm rule .",
    "moreover , the respective probabilities @xmath36 are equal for each step of the iteration process . consequently , the cvm iteration may be seen as a ( time - homogeneous ) random choice among deterministic options , and is therefore a markov chain ( see @xcite and @xcite for all details ) .    due to the sequential update scheme only one agent ( namely , agent @xmath17 ) may change its state at each time step .",
    "this means that a non - zero transition probabilities exist only between agent configurations @xmath37 that differ in at most one element ( agent ) .",
    "we call those configuration adjacent and write @xmath38 if @xmath39 and @xmath40 . considering that @xmath31 ( for contrarian rule ) is chosen with probability @xmath14 and @xmath30 ( vm rule ) with @xmath41 , and that this choice is independent of the agent choice , the micro - level transition probability @xmath42 between two adjacent configurations @xmath43 is given by @xmath44 notice that the configuration space of the cvm ( @xmath0 ) is the set of all bit - strings of length @xmath1 , and that therefore , the micro - level process for the cvm corresponds to a random walk on the hypercube ( as for the vm , see @xcite )",
    ". notice also that the cvm leads to a _ regular _ chain ( as opposed to an absorbing random walk for the original vm ) because whenever @xmath45 , there is a non - zero probability that the process leaves the consensus states @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "( [ eq : phatvmcontrarian ] ) tells us that this probability is precisely @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , the system does not converge to a fixed configuration and the long - term behavior of the model can be characterized by its stationary distribution .",
    "the most natural level of observation in binary state dynamics is to consider the temporal evolution of the attribute densities , or respectively , the number of agents in the two different states .",
    "while a mean - field description would typically formulate the macro dynamics as a differential equation describing the evolution of attribute densities , the markov chain approach operates with a discrete description ( in time as well as in space ) in which all possible levels of absolute attribute frequencies and transitions between them are taken into account .",
    "let us denote as @xmath48 the number of @xmath12-agents in the population ( @xmath49 ) and refer to this level of observation as global or _",
    "full aggregation_. in terms of markov chain aggregation @xcite , a macro description in terms of @xmath48 is achieved by a projection of the micro - level process on the hypercube onto a new process with the state space defined by the partition @xmath50 , where @xmath51 .",
    "notice that in hypercube terminology that level of observation corresponds to the hamming weight of a configuration @xmath52 and each @xmath53 collects all micro configurations with the same hamming weight .    .",
    "the resulting macro process is , in general , a non - markovian process on the line . ]",
    "one important observation in @xcite has been that homogeneous mixing is a prerequisite for lumpability with respect to @xmath54 , and that microscopic heterogeneities ( be it in the agents or in their connections ) translate into dynamical irregularities that prevent lumpability .",
    "this means that full aggregation over the agent attributes ( @xmath55 ) leads in general to a non - markovian macro process .",
    "we illustrate this process in fig .",
    "[ fig : fullaggregation ] .",
    "still , the process obtained by the projection from micro to macro is characterized by the fact that from an atom @xmath53 the only possible transitions are the loop to @xmath53 , or a transition to neighboring atoms @xmath56 and @xmath57 because only one agent changes at a time . however , the micro level transition rates ( [ eq : phatvmcontrarian ] ) depend essentially on the connectivity structure between the agents , and therefore , the transition probabilities at the macro level ( denoted as @xmath58 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fullaggregation ] ) are not uniquely defined ( except for the case of homogeneous mixing ) .",
    "that is , for two configurations in the same macro state @xmath59 the probability to go to another macro state ( e.g. , @xmath57 ) may be very different which violates the lumpability conditions of thm .",
    "6.3.2 in @xcite .",
    "before we use the cvm to address questions related to non - lumpable projections , we discuss the model behavior using markov chain tools for two stylized situations .",

    "can be used to define a markovian coarse - graining . as both interaction topologies are characterized by a large symmetry group , markov chain aggregation considerably",
    "reduces the size of the micro chains such that the important entities of interest ( e.g. , stationary distribution ) can be computed on the basis of the respective macroscopic transition matrices .",
    "the case of homogeneous mixing is particularly simple .",
    "let us consider that the model is implemented on the complete graph without loops where the probability to choose a pair @xmath33 of agents becomes @xmath60 whenever @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",

    "[ fig : in.all ] , first of all , is that the deviation from markovianity is most significant for small inter - community couplings .",

    "also if the inter - community coupling becomes larger than the coupling within communities ( a situation that resembles a bipartite graph ) @xmath96 and @xmath97 are very small , indicating that a markovian macro description ( i.e. , ideal aggregation , cf .",
    "@xcite , p. 140 and",
    "@xcite , pp .",

    "finally , we notice in fig .",
    "[ fig : in.all ] that the measures do not generally increase monotonically with a decreasing ratio @xmath16 which is most obvious for the example with a very small @xmath107 ( green curves ) .",

    "a large contrarian rate @xmath14 leads to a process which fluctuates around the states with approximately the same number of black and white agents , the fifty - fifty situation @xmath115 being the most probable observation .",
    "this is true for homogeneous mixing as well as for the two - community model .",
    "however , if @xmath14 is small , a significant difference between the two topologies emerges as the coupling between the two communities becomes weaker . on the complete graph the population is almost uniform for long periods of time , but due to the random perturbations introduced by the contrarian rule there are rare transitions between the two consensus profiles . on the community graph , an effect of local alignment is observed in addition to that , because the system is likely to approach a meta - stable state of intra - community consensus but inter - community polarization .",
    "a order - disorder phase transition as the contrarian rate increases has been observed on the complete graph in several previous contrarian opinion models ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for the cvm , in the transition from consensus switching to disorder",
    "there is a phase in which the process leads uniform stationary distribution in which all opinion frequency levels @xmath51 are observed with equal probability ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "the contrarian rate @xmath14 at which this happens is @xmath15 and depends inversely on the system size such that a model with a single contrarian agent fails to enter the ordered regime .",
    "this confirms and explains the behavior observed in @xcite for a model with a fixed number of contrarian agents .",
    "a particular focus of this paper has been on the effect of inhomogeneities in the interaction topology on the stationary behavior . in this regard ,",
    "the two - community cvm served as a suitable scenario to assess the macroscopic effects introduced by a slight microscopic heterogeneity .",
    "namely , homogeneous mixing compatible with the usual way of aggregation over all agents leads to a random walk on the line with @xmath117 states whereas the two - community model leads to a random walk on a 2d lattice with @xmath118 states .",
    "as the latter is a proper refinement of the former this gives us means to study the relation between the two coarse - grainings in a markov chain setting . in this regard , this paper has made visible the reasons for which lumpability fails , and it has also provided a first analysis of the macroscopic memory effects that are introduced by heterogeneous interaction structures . in this regard , the paper demonstrates that information - theoretic measures are a promising tool to study the relationship between different levels of description in abms .",
    "there are various issues that deserve further discussion .",
    "for instance , is the emergence of memory in the transition from the micro to the macro level a useful characterization for the complexity of a certain system ?",
    "namely , the theory of markov chain aggregation makes explicit statements about when a micro process is _ compressible _ to a certain macro - level description .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
