    "in recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in b20-ordered transition metal monosilicides@xcite and monogermanides.@xcite the magnetic ground state of these alloys is helimagnetic by virtue of the hierarchy of energy terms which determine the magnetic order .",
    "what distinguishes these alloys from conventionally ordered ferromagnets is that the b20 unit cell lacks inversion symmetry .",
    "this results in a non - vanishing dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction ( dmi ) which tends to favour orthogonal spin configurations .",
    "this is typically weaker than the ferromagnetic ( fm ) heisenberg exchange which favours parallel spin alignment , and a compromise is reached causing neighbouring spins to ca nt with respect to one another leading to non - trivial chiral spin textures . in fege",
    "the ground state is helimagnetic with a pitch , @xmath5 , ( determined by the ratio of the fm and dmi energy terms , @xmath6 ) of @xmath770  nm.@xcite when a magnetic field is applied along the propagation direction of the helix it is distorted into a conical state which saturates at high fields into the fm uniformly magnetized state .",
    "neutron scattering@xcite provided clues as to a further complexity in the phase diagram leading to the direct observation@xcite of a complex spin modulation known as a skyrmion crystal : a hexagonally close - packed arrangement of topologically protected knot - like spin textures with potential applications in spintronics.@xcite    much of the research on the b20 alloys has been on bulk single crystal material but there has been recent progress growing films by molecular beam epitaxy on si  ( 111 ) substrates.@xcite epilayers of fege have recently been produced by huang and chien by the relatively faster and more cost - effective method of magnetron sputtering,@xcite a growth technique previously used to grow polycrystalline b20 fe@xmath8co@xmath9si@xcite .",
    "here we report the growth of a textured film of fege also using dc magnetron sputtering at elevated temperatures following a similar method to that described in ref . .",
    "in this report we focus on the magnetometry and magnetotransport of an 82  nm thick sputtered film , and have determined the scattering mechanisms responsible for the observed temperature dependence of the magnetoresistance ( mr ) and anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) .    despite decades of research",
    "the ahe has many aspects that are still open questions.@xcite the origins of the effect are all in some manner based upon spin - orbit coupling , but the individual mechanisms contributing to the overall effect can be difficult to deconvolute from one another .",
    "it is now generally accepted that skew scattering , side - jump scattering , and intrinsic anomalous contributions to the transverse resistivity @xmath10 sum to account for the ahe , with each mechanism having a power law scaling with respect to the longitudinal resistivity @xmath11.@xcite accurately determining which mechanism is most influential involves determining which scaling holds experimentally .",
    "this can be achieved by production of multiple samples either by doping,@xcite tailoring thicknesses to alter the longitudinal resistivity,@xcite or simply from individual samples as was the case for early experiments on fe and ni.@xcite in fege we measure here a single film which has a strong quadratic dependence of the ahe on the longitudinal resistivity over a wide temperature range .",
    "in addition , we report a large mr in the saturated fm state that displays three clear temperature regimes in which different scattering mechanisms must predominate .",
    "an unexpected experimental fact is that none of the boundaries of these regimes coincide with the magnetic phase transition  where there are , in fact , no discernible features in @xmath12  but occur at much lower temperatures . by fitting the the high - field mr at all measured temperatures we are able to extract the mr due to scattering from the conical magnetic texture occurring below magnetic saturation , which arises from a similar giant magnetoresistance - type mechanism to that in magnetic domain walls .",
    "finally , we observe the topological hall effect in our fege film , reproducing the important observation of huang and chien,@xcite and confirming the quality of our thin film monogermanide materials .",

    "approximately one atomic monolayer of pure fe was then deposited to generate an fesi seed layer by solid - phase epitaxy .",

    "these spin fluctuations may be helical in nature due to the presence of dmi , but tend to be fm in character further from @xmath3 , all the while reducing in intensity.@xcite thus at higher temperatures the influence of spin fluctuations on the resistivity is diminished and we would anticipate the magnitude of this contribution to decrease again for @xmath83 , as is the case with helimagnet mnsi.@xcite in fege , magnetic fluctuations have been measured well above the temperatures for establishing long - ranged magnetic order,@xcite which can account for the observed mr far above @xmath3 in our film .",
