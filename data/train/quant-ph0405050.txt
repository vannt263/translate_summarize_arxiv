    "a quantum computer is expected to solve some of computationally hard problems for a conventional digital computer @xcite .",
    "the realization of a practical quantum computer is , however , still challenging in many respects @xcite .",
    "one of the obstacles to any realization is a phenomenon known as `` decoherence '' .",
    "the number of gate operations is severely limited since a quantum state is vulnerable due to interactions with the surroundings .",
    "many strategies to overcome internal and external decoherence have been proposed , such as ( 1 ) quantum error correcting codes @xcite ( 2 ) decoherence - free subspaces @xcite ( 3 ) holonomic quantum computation @xcite , among others . in a conventional design of a quantum circuit , the so - called elementary set of gates @xcite such as single - qubit @xmath0 rotations and cnot gates , are utilized .",
    "this design is motivated by the universality theorem proved in ref .",
    "suppose we are to implement an @xmath1-qubit unitary matrix @xmath2 .",
    "in the conventional implementation this matrix is decomposed into a product of @xmath0 matrices acting bewteen a pair of basis vectors .",
    "then a cnot gate transforms one of the basis vectors to a new vector , so that the pair of the vectors forms a subspace corresponding to a single qubit on which the @xmath0 matrix acts .",
    "quantum algorithm acceleration is a totally new approach to the decoherence issue .",
    "this principle is originally proposed in the context of the holonomic quantum computation @xcite and of josephson junction qubits @xcite . what is required to implement",
    "is not individual elementary gates but rather the @xmath1-qubit matrix @xmath3 realizing the given quantum algorithm . this matrix is directly implemented by properly choosing the control parameters in the hamiltonian .",
    "the variational principle tells us that the gate execution time reduces , in general , compared to the conventional construction since the conventional gate sequence belongs to the possible solutions in direct implementation .",
    "the proposal @xcite has been made for fictitious josephson charge qubits , which are still beyond reach .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to demonstrate the acceleration of a quantum algorithm using an nmr quantum computer at our hand . for this demonstration ,",
    "we employ two - qubit grover s search algorithm whose initial state @xmath4 is generated as a pseudopure state by cyclic permutations of the state populations @xcite . in this process , we need to prepare three different initial states using @xmath5 transformations acting on a thermal equilibrium ensemble .",
    "it is found that the optimized pulse sequence reduces the gate operation time to 25% of the conventional pulse sequence operation time in two ensembles while it remains unchanged in one ensemble , which is already optimized using the conventional pulse sequence .",
    "the next section is devoted to the formalism of our approach .",
    "the hamiltonian for the two - qubit molecule is introduced and the time - evolution operator is defined .",
    "section iii is the main part of this paper , where the exact solutions for grover s algorithm are obtained .",
    "these solutions are experimentally verified with our nmr computer .",
    "section iv is devoted to summary and discussion .",
    "in the present paper , we are concerned with an nmr quantum computer with a two - qubit heteronucleus molecule . to be more specific , we use carbon-13 labeled chloroform as a computational resource throughout our theoretical and experimental analyses .",
    "the hamiltonian of the molecule is @xmath6\\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\omega_{12 } \\left[\\cos \\phi_2 ( i_2 \\otimes \\sigma_x /2 ) +   \\sin \\phi_2 ( i_2 \\otimes \\sigma_y/2 ) \\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & & + 2\\pi j \\sigma_z \\otimes \\sigma_z/4 , \\label{eq : ham}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the rotating frame of each nucleus . here",
    "@xmath7 is the unit matrix of order 2 while @xmath8 is the @xmath9th pauli matrix .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 is the amplitude of the rf pulse for the @xmath11th spin while @xmath12 is its phase .",
    "these four independent control parameters are collectively denoted as @xmath13 .",
    "the time - evolution operator @xmath14 = { \\mathcal t } \\exp\\left[-i \\int_0^t h(\\gamma(t ) ) dt\\right]\\ ] ] associated with the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) is a functional of @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the time - ordered product and we employ the natural units in which @xmath17 is set to unity . note that @xmath18 \\in su(4)$ ] since ( [ eq : ham ] ) is traceless .",
    "suppose we want to implement a unitary gate @xmath2 .",
    "then our task is to find a function @xmath15 such that @xmath14 = u_{\\rm target}. \\label{eq : inverse}\\ ] ] the solution of this problem is highly nontrivial and we often resort to numerical analysis @xcite .",
    "note , moreover , that we would like to construct time - optimal solutions among many possible solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : inverse ] ) to fight against decoherence .",
    "it must also be examined whether the optimal solution thus obtained has control parameters that are experimentally accessible .",
    "it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that there exists a geometrical picture for the time - optimal solution in the case of nmr quantum computation for two - qubit heteronuclear molecules . here",
    "we summarize briefly the relevant aspects of their idea that are required for our investigation .",
    "the crucial observation is that the one - qubit rotation is carried out in a negligible time compared to that required for two - qubit operation generated by the @xmath19-coupling term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) and hence time required for the one - qubit rotation can be neglected in evaluating the gate operation time .",
    "then it is natural to consider the homogeneous space @xmath20 , where @xmath21 , in which two - qubit gates that differ by one - qubit operations @xmath22 are identified .",
    "the path in the homogeneous space is then generated by the @xmath19-coupling term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) .",
    "a remark is in order .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) contains neither @xmath23 nor @xmath24 and it seems impossible to consider the equivalence class based on the whole subgroup @xmath25 .",
    "note , however , that these terms are easily generated by @xmath26 and @xmath27 as @xmath28 for example , and hence it makes sense to identify all the elements of @xmath5 , that differ with each other modulo the subgroup @xmath25 . with the same token , the terms @xmath29 and @xmath30 may be included in the @xmath19-coupling part of the hamiltonian since @xmath31 for example .",
    "it should be noted that the set @xmath32 comprises the cartan subalgebra of @xmath5 in a relevant basis and hence @xmath33    suppose we want to find a time - optimal path @xmath15 connecting the unit matrix @xmath34 of order four and the target matrix @xmath35 . the prescription given above suggests that we should find the time - optimal path in @xmath20 that connects the equivalence classes @xmath25 and @xmath36 . in other words , we have to solve the matrix equation @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 the total execution time is then given by @xmath40 .",
    "the group @xmath5 is 15-dimensional , while each of the @xmath41 has six parameters and @xmath42 has three , thus @xmath43 parameters in total .",
    "it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ eq:1qubit ] ) and ( [ eq:2qubit ] ) that the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) contains the necessary and sufficient number of control parameters to construct an arbitrary quantum gate .",
    "the solution of the decomposition ( [ eq : decomp ] ) is difficult to find and we have to resort to numerical methods in general . as an example , we work out in the present section grover s seach algorithm @xcite in the framework outlined in the previous section .",
    "grover s algorithm for a two - qubit case is implemented by unitary matrices of the form @xmath44 where @xmath45 picks out the desired `` data '' @xmath46 by operating on @xmath47 as @xmath48 where we have written explicitly the possible phase on the rhs . )  ( [ eq:11 ] ) in the _ phase _ of the matrix elements , which does not bring about any observable difference . ]",
    "an interesting observation is that all the matrix elements are either 0 or @xmath49 , which implies that @xmath45 is not only in @xmath5 but also in @xmath50 .",
    "this further restricts the degrees of freedom of the matrix since @xmath50 is six - dimensional .",
    "in fact , our numerical results show that the decomposition ( [ eq : decomp ] ) takes a highly constrained form .      according to the presecription given in the previous section , we search a pulse sequence of the form @xmath51 . instead of solving this inverse problem",
    ", we define the equivalent variational problem which is easy to solve , at least numerically .",
    "let @xmath14 = k_2(\\gamma_2 )   u_j(t ) k_1(\\gamma_1),\\ ] ] where @xmath52 and @xmath42 has been given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : uj ] ) .",
    "now we define the penalty function @xmath53 $ ] as @xmath54 = \\|u[\\gamma(t ) ] -u_{\\rm target}\\|_{\\rm f},\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the frobenius norm of a matrix @xmath56 .",
    "note that @xmath53 $ ] is positive definite and that its zeros are the absolute minima . thus solving the inverse problem",
    "is recast into a variational task for finding the absolute minima of @xmath53 $ ] .    to find the absolute minima ,",
    "we have generated 512 initial conditions and searched for the optimal solutions with the polytope algorithm on a parallel computer with 512 cpus .",
    "to our surprise , the execution time @xmath57 is discrete and assumes the values @xmath58 for all four cases .",
    "the ambiguity @xmath59 corresponds to the path leaving from @xmath34 and traversing the compact group @xmath5 @xmath1 times before hitting the destination @xmath60 .",
    "the result shows that fig .",
    "1 of @xcite is misleading at least in the present case : the distance between the cosets @xmath61 and @xmath62 is _ unique _ in the sense that the only degree of freedom left is how many times the path traverses @xmath5 before arriving at the target .    the optimal execution time obtained here , however , is the same as that for the conventional pulse sequence @xcite in all cases . in other words ,",
    "the conventional pulse sequences are already time - optimal .",
    "for such a simple algorithm , time - optimization may be carried out by inspection by experts .",
    "therefore , we look for more complicated cases to demonstrate the power of this method .",
    "suppose we would like to execute grover s search algorithm with a room - temperature liquid state nmr computer .",
    "the sample is in a thermal equilibrium state and we will use the temporal averaging by cyclic permutations of state populations to obtain a pseudopure initial state .",
    "this is carried out by applying the unitary operators @xmath63 and @xmath64 to the initial thermal state before @xmath45 is executed . here",
    "@xmath65 stands for the cnot gate with the control bit @xmath11 and the target bit @xmath66 .",
    "we now present our search result for @xmath67 and @xmath68 , the other @xmath69 producing similar results .",
    "* @xmath70 : an example of a typical time - optimal solution for @xmath70 is @xmath71 the execution time is @xmath72 , which simply reproduces that for the conventional pulse sequence @xcite .",
    "therefore , the conventional pulse sequence is already optimized .",
    "we will employ the conventional pulse sequence for @xmath70 in the following .",
    "* @xmath73 : for this case , an example of the time - optimal pulse sequence is @xmath74,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the second line of @xmath75 shows the pulse sequence made of the existing terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "it should be noted that this pulse sequence requires the execution time @xmath76 in spite of an additional gate @xmath77 , which is composed of two cnot gates and costs @xmath78 of time to execute in the conventional pulse sequence .",
    "the execution time of the time - optimal pulse sequence is 25% of that for the conventional pulse sequence .",
