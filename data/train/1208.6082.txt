    "for @xmath0-rays coming from annihilations of dark matter particles in the halo , the fermi - lat instrument @xcite has very successfully delivered bounds that have recently started to probe into the parameter space of viable models , in line with pre - launch expectations @xcite , in particular for dwarf spheroidal galaxies @xcite and galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "interestingly , there have very recently appeared analyses of public fermi - lat data @xcite where a rather strong tentative dark matter signal has been seen , in a line - search from the halo in the vicinity of the galactic centre @xcite there is a feature , which has been interpreted as either originating from internal bremsstrahlung @xcite around 150 gev @xcite , or a @xmath0-ray line @xcite at around 130 gev @xcite .",
    "this discovery has already gained considerable attention from theorists ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "the line signal has subsequently been independently verified by other analyses of the same public data @xcite . in particular , in the analysis @xcite a signal of more than @xmath3",
    "was claimed , with some evidence also for a second line , with energy consistent with annihilation into @xmath1 , which generally also should exist in many models @xcite .",
    "there have already appeared quite a number of proposed models for this feature aound 130 gev @xcite , although the previously much studied supersymmetric models now seem disfavoured in most of the supersymmetric scenarios , due to the non - appearance of a characteristic @xmath0-ray continuum that should result from fragmentation of quarks , @xmath4- and @xmath5-bosons or gluons @xcite .",
    "( see , however , @xcite for some interesting surviving parts of the huge supersymmetric parameter space . )",
    "let us now turn to another attractive model from the particle physics point of view , namely radiative see - saw models for neutrino masses ( for a recent review containing many of the original references , see @xcite ) .",
    "some 10 years ago , an interesting model was proposed @xcite , where a right - handed neutrino of mass less than about a tev plays a crucial role in giving mass to the otherwise massless standard model neutrinos through a high - order loop mechanism .",
    "( this is a version of the zee model @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for a more recent formulation of models with similar phenomenology . )    in this model , neutrino masses appear only at the three loop level , achieved by supplementing in the simplest version the standard model ( sm ) fields with two charged singlet scalars @xmath6 and @xmath7 and one right handed neutrino @xmath8 .",
    "( we will here stick to this simplest model , as we expect the @xmath0-ray features studied here depend very little on the details of more elaborate , and perhaps more realistic schemes , such as elaborated upon in @xcite ) .",
    "lepton number is broken explicitly by including a majorana mass term for the right - handed neutrino , and imposing a discrete @xmath9 symmetry under which the sm fields and @xmath6 are neutral but @xmath7 and @xmath8 transform as @xmath10 which forbids dirac masses for the neutrinos .",
    "this gives the lagrangian @xmath11 the potential @xmath12 contains in particular a @xmath13 coupling , and a mild hierarchy of masses @xmath14 100 gev - 1 tev is assumed .",
    "furthermore , the yukawa couplings @xmath15 , @xmath16 are of order unity , making @xmath8 stable in view of the discrete symmetry .",
    "left - handed neutrino masses are first induced at three loops @xcite . for @xmath17 of the order of a tev",
    ", one finds an effective dimension - five effective mass scale of @xmath18 gev , giving remarkably neutrino masses at the @xmath19 ev scale without involving fundamental mass scales larger than a tev .    in this leptonically interacting massive particle model ( a leptophilic wimp , named limp in the paper by baltz and bergstrm @xcite , bb in the following ) , @xmath8 becomes stable and is therefore a natural dark matter ( dm ) candidate . through @xmath7 exchange",
    "it couples extremely weakly today , due to the low dm velocities in the galactic halo .",
    "the reason for this is its majorana nature , which means that the couplings in the s wave are proportional to the mass of charged leptons in the final state @xcite . in the early universe ,",
    "on the other hand , p - wave annihilation was important and set the relic density @xmath20 ( the scaled hubble constant @xmath21 ) .",
    "it was noted in the original proposal @xcite that this would be a fine dm candidate , but thought to be essentially undetectable , as the rate of direct detection through scattering on nucleons would be very small .",
    "similarly , indirect detection through neutrinos from the earth or the sun will not be possible , as the cross section for capture is negligibly small .",
    "however , in bb @xcite , it was pointed out that this candidate , on the contrary , has excellent detection probability in indirect detection through the annihilation @xmath22 or through the internal bremsstrahlung process @xmath23 ( the last process with its surprising avoidance of helicity suppression , and the relation to the @xmath24 line was first discovered in @xcite in the context of supersymmetric models for dark matter , with refinements over the last few years @xcite ) .",
    "thus , this model has the intriguing property of connecting the dark matter problem with that of neutrinos masses .",
    "the unique window is through @xmath0-ray detection of annihilation of the typical fingerprint of this model : an internal bremsstrahlung broad enhancement with maximum near 90 % of the @xmath8 mass , supplemented with two @xmath0-rays lines from the @xmath25 and @xmath1 final states , where the @xmath25 line will appear at @xmath26 and the @xmath1 line at @xmath27 , as dictated by energy and momentum conservation .",
    "both lines are intrinsically very narrow , meaning that in practice the energy resolution of the detector will be decisive for their detection .",
    "( note that for majorana particles , the annihilation in the s - wave takes place from a pseudoscalar state , and therefore no @xmath28 line , with @xmath29 the higgs boson , is expected , as a @xmath30 radiative transition is forbidden . )    in bb , @xmath1 electroweak mixing and therefore the @xmath1 annihilation channel was neglected ( and in @xcite it was not kinematically allowed ) .",
    "that this model has a very good chance of giving an observable structure in fermi - lat is in fact strengthened by a more complete analysis , which will be briefly presented here .",
    "we will find a striking agreement of the shape of the structure with the ( admittedly still scarce ) fermi - lat data analyzed in @xcite .",
    "a very interesting aspect , which contrasts with supersymmetric dm , is the essential lack of freedom of choice of parameters and therefore the predictive power of the model .",
    "the cross determining the relic @xmath8 density can be written @xcite @xmath31\\,m_r^2v^2 + \\ldots\\right ] , \\label{eq : freeze}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath32 the charged lepton mass , @xmath33 the @xmath7 mass and @xmath34 the limp ( @xmath8 ) mass .",
    "for @xmath35 not too much larger than unity , the factor in square brackets is typically close to @xmath36 , so that for @xmath34 not larger than a tev , the p - wave cross section ( the term proportional to @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : freeze ] ) ) determines the freeze  out temperature @xmath38 and thus the relic abundance .",
    "typically , @xmath39 , and thus @xmath40 .",
    "the requirement that the limp be the dark matter particle , with relic abundance @xmath41 , then fixes the freeze - out cross section @xmath42 for a given @xmath8 of mass @xmath34 , this sets the normalization of the combination @xmath43 which governs many annihilation processes . the total annihilation rate into lepton pairs @xmath44 at rest ( putting @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : freeze ] ) ) is for each flavour ( assuming flavour universal couplings ) @xmath46    it was noted @xcite that in order that the couplings @xmath47 not be larger than 1 , for nearly degenerate @xmath8 and @xmath7 , @xmath34 can not be too much heavier than 1 tev , but could be significantly lighter .",
    "we now thus insert the value found in @xcite of around @xmath48 gev for @xmath34 . actually with @xmath49 gev",
    "we find a slightly better fit , and we will use that value in the following .- ray features is however fixed once the mass is set . ] assuming near degeneracy , but choosing for simplicity @xmath50 , to avoid complications of possible coannihilations ( this could of course be relaxed in a more refined treatment ) , we find a value of @xmath51 , where we for simplicity assume flavor universality , i.e. , @xmath52 ( see @xcite for a more realistic ansatz in a more elaborate model )",
    ". limps with these values of the parameters have a very small annihilation rate for the @xmath53 and @xmath54 channels . even for @xmath55 , the helicity suppression is of the order of @xmath56 . at that level , the p - wave term in the galactic halo",
    "also may contribute a small amount .",
    "we neglect that here , but include continuum @xmath0-rays from decays of directly produced @xmath57 leptons in our figures .",
    "they turn out to be not very important , however .",
    "also , there is a contribution to @xmath0-rays from @xmath4 decays produced in the similar gaugestrahlung process with the final state @xmath58 which also is surprisingly large @xcite .",
    "( there is no corresponding @xmath5-strahlung for these singlet fields . )",
    "this contribution from @xmath4 decays is also included in the numerical estimates , but also turn out to be inessential .",
    "in fact , predictions for a 100 gev limp were made in bb ( see fig .",
    "2 ( a ) in @xcite ) , and shown to be possibly quite spectacular .",
    "( this is in contrast with the predictions for positrons from the same process which need a `` boost factor '' of more than several thousand to match the anomalous positron ratio of which there were indications already at that time @xcite . )",
    "thus there is a reason for scrutinizing present fermi - lat data to see whether the 135 gev limp fits the spectral feature recently discovered .",
    "gev consists of a 135 gev @xmath25 line , a 119.6 gev @xmath1 line and an internal bremsstrahlung continuum , from @xmath59 .",
    "] indeed , we will find that this model , especially when augmented with the @xmath1 line ( which was left out in bb ) and having both that line , the @xmath24 line and the internal bremsstrahlung contribution fits the fermi - lat feature surprisingly well .",
    "we will compare with the original analysis in @xcite and choose for convenience the einasto profile reg .",
    "3 `` source '' events in the parlance of that reference .",
    "we note that we are not making a `` best fit '' analysis as this is not very meaningful given the presently rather scarce data .",
    "the point is that with more and better data in the future , the @xmath0-ray `` fingerprint '' of this model should present itself , if this model for the dark matter is correct .",
    "to make sure that continuum @xmath0s are not overproduced in @xmath4 decays from the @xmath1 final state , we include this contribution using the freely available darksusy code @xcite , but also this flux is quite small . in recent versions of the darksusy code",
    "all three processes : internal bremsstrahlung , @xmath24 and @xmath1 are included and well documented in the original literature @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , respectively , so here we only show and discuss the results .",
    "we note that all three processes have to exist in this type of model , and have to be included for consistency .",
    "rate could be made , as the results of the two existing calculations @xcite agree well in models where intermediate @xmath5 bosons dominate , but in the `` bino - like '' case of relevance here , there seem to be some discrepancies @xcite . ]",
    "normalizing to the correct relic density , the internal bremsstrahlung contributes around @xmath60 @xmath61s@xmath62 to the annihilation of these slow limps in the halo .",
    "the bulk forms a broad bump around @xmath63 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the @xmath24 line gives @xmath64 @xmath61s@xmath62 ( including a factor 2 for the two photons ) , and the @xmath1 line has a @xmath65 of @xmath66 @xmath61s@xmath62 .",
    "the combined rate in the galactic halo is thus @xmath67 a value not to far from the estimate of the experimentally observed effect in @xcite of @xmath68@xmath61s@xmath62 ( for the favoured einasto profile ) . in @xcite ,",
    "this was interpreted only in terms of one @xmath0 line , but the limited energy resolution of the fermi - lat instrument , around @xmath69 % fwhm @xcite , is only barely enough to resolve the structure into its separate components ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "note , however , that @xcite favour , although not very strongly , a two - line structure , especially when selecting data in the detector from directions where the photons pass more matter in the calorimeter and the energy resolution is therefore improved by a factor around two @xcite",
    ". we will soon return to our prediction for an instrument with this better energy resolution .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] is shown the total @xmath0-ray differential flux and the respective contributing process .",
    "the results are given for the particle physics factor @xmath70 for slow annihilations such as in the galactic halo , i.e. , in units of @xmath61s@xmath62gev@xmath62 , and are very robust around this mass range , as the normalization is set by the relic density constraint .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] a comparison with of these results is made with the fermi - lat data as analyzed by weniger @xcite , multiplied by @xmath71 , and and arbitrary normalization constant ( of order 10 ) to match the overall size of the effect .",
    "the reason for this `` boost factor '' is presently unknown , but in this model it has to be explained by astrophysical effects , such as the detailed distribution of dark matter near the galactic centre .",
    "( so - called sommerfeld enhancement @xcite is not expected in this model .",
    "there may in principle be fine - tuned mechanisms like s - wave pseudoscalar resonances or particles with higher electric charge running the loop , but we do not employ such exotica here . ) the required boost may be related to another puzzle of the signal , which is a displacement from the exact galactic centre by around 200 pc .",
    "as can be seen , once the overall strength has been set , the agreement with present data is ( perhaps fortuitously ) intriguing . for the rather low average energy resolution ( 10% fwhm ) of fermi - lat ,",
    "the double - peak structure is barely visible .",
    "improving , however , the resolution by a factor of two , which has been done in @xcite ( sacrificing statistics ) , by selecting observation angles which give large path - lengths of the electromagnetic shower in the detector , the twin peak structure is much clearer .",
    "this is qualitatively in agreement with our results ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig3 ] ) .    in fig  [ fig : fig3 ]",
    "is also shown what one may expect from the next generation of @xmath0-ray space detectors with energy resolution at the one percent level , such as gamma-400 @xcite and dampe ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "given that the type of model described here is the correct explanation of dark matter , the features of the signal would be striking .",
    "with such an instrument one could start analyzing the dark matter halo density distribution in some detail .",
    "in fact , the property of the fingerprint of this model is , besides the two strong lines , the rather broad and slightly asymmetric bremsstrahlung bump .",
    "the absence of this bump would rule out the model .",
    "the theoretical reason for the necessity of the internal bremstrahlung bump and its relation to the line signal is quite interesting .",
    "it was shown in @xcite how these features are crucial for reproducing the effective axial anomaly in these theories ( which lack anomalies at the fundamental level ) .",
    "in fact , the strength of the @xmath25 line can almost trivially be computed by using the anomaly result ( @xmath72 in @xcite ) .",
    "also , compact formulas for the internal bremsstrahlung contribution can be found there ( recently checked independently @xcite ) .",
    "the validity of these formulas is more general than for the specific @xmath8 case discussed here .",
    "the strength of the @xmath1 line is trickier to compute due to the non - zero @xmath73 , but we can use darksusy  ( based on @xcite ) for its calculation .    of course , one should also be aware of the possibility that the feature in the fermi - lat may be spurious .",
    "although it seems unlikely that it is caused by a statistical fluctuation , one can not yet exclude that its origin is in some ( unknown ) instrumental effect .",
    "hence one should wait for the results of the analysis of the fermi - lat collaboration itself before taking our comparison with data too seriously .",
    "it will also be interesting to see if data can be independently reproduced by the hess - ii instrument which just has seen first light ( see @xcite , where also the potential of cta @xcite and an instrument like gamma-400 @xcite is analyzed ) .",
    "also , it remains to be seen if the recent rather statistically shaky indications of a signal from galaxy clusters @xcite will survive more data .",
    "this will most immediately come from the fermi - lat instrument , which will continue to collect an amazing amount of impressively clean and interesting data over the next few years .",
    "the type of model discussed here has been rather extensively studied in the neutrino and particle physics communities in recent years , thanks to their ability to explain the observed neutrino masses without invoking a super - high mass scale .",
    "if couplings are not flavour diagonal , dangerous non - observed decays like @xmath74 may occur .",
    "however , this can be rather easily avoided , without affecting appreciably the results presented here , by invoking discrete symmetries , as explained in @xcite . in that reference , it is also pointed out that , remarkably , in the case of having @xmath34 and @xmath75 of the order of 100 gev and @xmath76 , i.e. , precisely the range of values that are forced upon us if we want to explain the fermi - lat structure , also the enigmatic discrepancy of the measured @xmath77 value @xcite with the theoretical prediction @xcite has a chance to be explained .",
    "( see , however , @xcite for a problem in a related generic model . )",
    "this is an interesting topic for further studies .    of course",
    ", even if the present indications from the public fermi - lat would disappear , this model still gives an interesting signal to search for using present and new @xmath0-ray detectors .",
    "the signal would naturally appear between 100 gev and a tev ( perhaps , then , with its canonically predicted rate , a factor of 10 lower than that indicated in @xcite ) .",
    "this energy region will be closely watched in the near future @xcite .",
    "one should note that there are interesting very recent indications that the dark matter density , at least locally , may be a factor of around 3 higher than the generally adopted value @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to analyze the predicted rates in such models with either a dark disk and/or an oblate dark matter halo .",
    "this could in principle explain the boost of order 10 needed to fit the @xmath8 dark matter model to the fermi - lat data as analyzed by weniger @xcite .    finally , a note on other ways to test the hypothesis of limp dark matter .",
    "unfortunately , the scattering cross section on nuclei will be very small .",
    "this was recently shown @xcite for an effective description of the @xmath24 vertex .",
    "also the radiative scattering process with one photon exchange responsible for scattering on nuclei has a depressingly low rate ( see @xcite for a detailed explanation of the reason for this suppression ) .",
    "whether there will be traces of this new sector , only interacting leptonically with standard model particles , at the lhc remains to be seen . in principle",
    ", there could be mediators that for instance also would explain the somewhat too high @xmath24 decay rate of the higgs boson candidate indicated by recent lhc data @xcite .",
    "it would then , similarly to in our case , be important to detect and measure the rate of @xmath78 ( @xcite ) , which in the standard model is closely related to @xmath79 .    another possibility for a future linear @xmath53 collider may be contemplated .",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath7 states have unit electric charge and would appear as ( rather slowly rising ) enhancements in the total @xmath53 cross section , both starting around 150 gev energy per beam .",
    "there is actually another , challenging , idea to directly probe the dark matter nature of the right handed neutrino .",
    "the idea is to excite with a strong electron beam ambient @xmath8 limps to the nearly degenerate @xmath7 , which would then immediately decay isotropically back to an electron and @xmath8 .",
    "this was first suggested and computed in the supersymmetric scenario in @xcite , and recently rediscovered @xcite .",
    "it seems that substantial experimental development would be needed , however",
    ".    it would also be interesting to work out the possible @xmath0-ray signals that could appear from very powerful electron jets emanating from centres of active galaxies , along the ideas of ref .",
    "@xcite , for a 135 gev @xmath8 .",
    "multiwavelength studies of the region around the galactic centre , in particular radio data , could be important for these models with positron and electron emission ( see , e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "it seems , judging from a recent detailed study , however , that for the einasto profile current limits are not constraining @xcite , but maybe with future experiments this could give an important cross - check .    to conclude , for indirect detection of dark matter",
    ", the excellent fermi - lat data  made public to the scientific community with many excellent analysis tools  has opened a very exciting opportunity for studies of detailed predictions from models such as the one discussed here . within a few years , the aquired data ( and here the verdict of the fermi - lat collaboration itself will be important ) could make us accept the model with confidence  or disprove it .",
    "these are interesting times for dark matter studies , indeed .",
    "the author wishes to thank ted baltz for the collaboration on the early bb paper , and gianfranco bertone , torsten bringmann , jan conrad , joakim edsj , christian farnier and christoph weniger for recent useful discussions .",

    "<S> recently , an interesting indication for a dark matter signal in the form of a narrow line , or maybe two lines and/or an internal bremsstrahlung feature , has been found in analyses of public data from the fermi - lat satellite detector . as recent analyses have also shown that there is little sign of extra contributions to continuum photons , it is natural to investigate leptophilic interacting massive particle ( limp ) models . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a model of radiatively generated neutrino masses may have the properties needed to explain the fermi - lat structure around 130 gev . </S>",
    "<S> this model was proposed some 10 years ago , and predicted a clearly observable @xmath0-ray signal in the fermi - lat ( then glast ) detector . </S>",
    "<S> here , we update and improve that analysis , and show as an example that a right - handed neutrino of mass 135 gev should give rise to three conspicuous effects : a broad internal bremsstrahlung bump with maximum around 120 gev , a 2@xmath0 line around 135 gev , and a @xmath1 line at 119.6 gev ( neglected in the previous work ) . these features together give a good fit to the 130 gev structure , given the present energy resolution of the fermi - lat data . </S>",
    "<S> an attractive feature of the model is that the particle physics properties are essentially fixed , once the relic density and the mass of the right - handed neutrino dark matter particle have been set . </S>",
    "<S> puzzling features of the data at present are a slight displacement of the signal from the galactic center , and a needed boost factor of order @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this presents interesting challenges for numerical simulations including both baryons and dark matter on scales of 100 pc , and perhaps a need to go beyond the simplest halo models . with upcoming experiments having better energy resolution , or with future fermi - lat data </S>",
    "<S> , the double - peak structure with a definite predicted ratio of the strengths of the two lines and the internal bremsstrahlung feature should be seen , if this model is correct . with the planned satellite gamma-400 </S>",
    "<S> , a striking fingerprint of this dark matter candidate should then appear . </S>"
