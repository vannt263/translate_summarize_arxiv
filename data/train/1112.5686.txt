    "investigations into the feasibility of detecting air fluorescence light from extensive air showers were conducted in the 1960 s by groups led by suga in japan and greisen in the united states .",
    "results from the japanese experiment , reported by hara et al.@xcite in 1969 , are reviewed here . in that report",
    ", the authors say `` one event is very likely due to the atmospheric scintillation [ fluorescence ] light from an air shower whose primary energy and distance are about @xmath0ev and 3 km , respectively '' .",
    "this was the first reported observation of fluorescence light from an air shower .",
    "the purpose of the present short note is to the review this observation in the light of our modern understanding of fluorescence detection .",
    "the japanese experiment ran at the dodaira observatory ( altitude 876 m ) for a period of 5 months from december 1968 .",
    "the fluorescence telescope consisted of a 1.6 m diameter fresnel lens focussing light onto a camera of 24 pmts , each of which imaged a 4.5@xmath1 degree portion of the sky .",
    "for the observation described here , the telescope with its field of view of @xmath2 was centered at an elevation of 30@xmath1 .",
    "the design was similar to greisen s cornell telescope @xcite .",
    "however the japanese design had the advantage of a larger fresnel lens , and faster electronics .",
    "the rise and fall - times of pulses on the cathode - ray tube displays were 0.12@xmath3s and 0.2@xmath3s respectively .",
    "the potential fluorescence observation ( event # 12 in fig 3 of @xcite ) triggered 8 pmts with an angular track length of @xmath4 and a duration of 1.9@xmath3s . in the next section we review the event geometry before considering the shape of the light profile received at the telescope .",
    "i have taken the pmt trigger times from fig 3 of @xcite , and using an estimate of the pmt pointing directions , i have made fits to the standard timing equation , @xmath5 to extract shower axis parameters @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 from the eight @xmath9 data points .",
    "i have assumed a vertical shower - detector plane ( sdp ) , and i have guessed at a timing uncertainty of 0.05@xmath3s for each point .",
    "the sdp and the axis parameters are illustrated in figure  [ fig : sdp ] .",
    "results of various timing fits are shown in figure  [ fig : time ] .",
    "because of the rather short angular track length of the event ( @xmath4 ) , the timing fit suffers a large degeneracy in the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 ; there is no curvature evident in the @xmath10 versus @xmath11 plot , meaning that while we do have an estimate of the the angular speed @xmath12 of the light spot across the camera , we have no information about @xmath13 .",
    "best _ fit in figure  [ fig : time ] returns @xmath14 and @xmath15 km , but we show that a wide range of values of @xmath8 give acceptable fits .",
    "other values not shown ( e.g. @xmath16 ) also give reasonable fits .     and",
    "@xmath7 , and the time @xmath6 at which the shower passes the point of closest approach .",
    "( image from d. kuempel).,width=377 ]    s for each point .",
    "the top left figure shows the best fit for @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the remaining plots show results when @xmath8 is fixed as indicated , and a fit is done for @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",

    "the remaining plots show results when @xmath8 is fixed as indicated , and a fit is done for @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the short track length of the event precludes a unique reconstruction of the shower axis.,title=\"fig:\",width=529 ]    the implication of this degeneracy is that the axis geometry of this event is very uncertain - the shower could be vertical ( @xmath17 assuming a vertical sdp ) with an impact parameter of @xmath18 km , or the shower could be approaching the detector with a zenith angle of @xmath19 ( ie @xmath20 ) and @xmath15 km .    the latter geometry of an inclined , approaching shower would produce a light signal dominated by cherenkov light . if this were the case , the claim of hara et al . of the observation of fluorescence light",
    "would be in question . however , hara et al . correctly point out that there is important information in the _ shape _ of the light profile recorded by the telescope .",
    "we test this in the next section .",
    "figure  3 and figure  4 of @xcite give information on the flux of light received by the telescope as a function of time ( or angle @xmath11 ) .",
    "the key point is that the flux profile is rather flat .",
    "i have performed some simulations of a shower with a range of axis geometries consistent with the timing fits from the previous section .",
    "the simulated shower had a fixed energy of @xmath21ev and a depth of maximum @xmath22g/@xmath23 .",
    "the aim of the exercise is _ not _ to fit the observed light profile , but to illustrate the change in the light profile shape as a function of the shower geometry .",
    "figure  [ fig : flux ] shows the results of these simulations .",
    "we find that flat light profiles are only seen for more vertical showers .",
    "showers that approach the telescope ( @xmath24 and smaller ) produce peaked light profiles , and produce signals contaminated by a large direct cherenkov light component .",
    "the peaked shape of these profiles is a consequence of the narrow angular distribution of cherenkov light around the shower axis .",
    "it appears very likely that the signal detected by hara et al .",
    "was one dominated by fluorescence light , and it is reasonable that they lay claim to the first such detection .",
    "while the timing information of the event is not sufficient to reconstruct a unique shower axis geometry , the event s light profile is consistent with a fluorescence profile , and quite unlike the peaked profile expected for a cherenkov dominated signal .",
    "of course some doubt does remain , and the first _ unambiguous _ detection of fluorescence light from an air shower was with the utah fly s eye prototype operated in coincidence with the volcano ranch surface array in 1977 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath21ev shower simulated in this note produced a light profile with a peak flux of about @xmath25photons / m@xmath26/s , the flux observed in @xcite .",
    "this energy is a factor of two lower than that claimed by hara et al . , but this can be explained by their assumption of a fluorescence yield of 1.9 photons per metre of electron track , which is approximately a factor of two lower than the modern accepted value .",
    "one remaining uncertainty in this energy is the absolute light calibration of the experiment .",
    "hara et al .",
    "discuss an inconsistency between the observed light intensity spectrum and that expected from simulations .",
    "the inconsistency led to them increasing the observed light fluxes by a factor of 5 .",
    "the origin of the inconsistency is unclear , but it would probably be safe to say that @xmath21ev is an upper limit to the energy of the observed air shower .",
