    "there is plenty of literature on cross - layer resource optimization in wireless systems . for example",
    ", there are papers on joint power and subcarrier allocations to maximize the sum throughput for ofdma systems@xcite .",
    "there are also papers on joint power and precoder optimization to boost the sum rate , weighted sum mmse or sinr for mimo wireless systems@xcite .",
    "all these papers illustrate that significant throughput gain can be obtained by joint optimization of radio resource across the physical ( phy ) and the media access control ( mac ) layers .",
    "however , a typical assumption in these papers is that the transmitter has an infinite backlog and the information flow is delay insensitive . as a result",
    ", these papers focus only on optimizing the phy layer performance metrics such as sum throughput , mmse , sinr or proportional fairness , and the resulting control policy is adaptive to the channel state information ( csi ) only .    in practice , it is very important to consider random bursty arrivals and delay performance metrics in addition to the conventional phy layer performance metrics in cross - layer optimization , which may embrace the phy , mac and network layers . a combined framework taking into account both queueing delay and phy layer performance is not trivial as it involves both queueing theory ( to model the queue dynamics ) and information theory ( to model the phy layer dynamics ) .",
    "the system state involves both the csi and the queue state information ( qsi ) and the delay - optimal control policy should be adaptive to both the csi and the qsi of wireless systems as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : illustrate - delay - cross - layer ] .",
    "this design approach is fundamentally challenging for the following reasons .",
    "first , there may not be closed - form expressions relating the optimization objective ( such as the average delay ) and the optimization variables ( power , precoder , etc ) .",
    "second , it is not clear if the optimization problems are convex ( in most cases , they are not convex ) .",
    "third , there is the _ curse of dimensionality _ due to the exponential growth of the cardinality of the system state space as well as the large dimension of the control action space involved ( i.e. , set of actions ) .",
    "for example , consider a queueing network with @xmath0 queues , each with finite buffer size @xmath1 .",
    "the size of the system state space is @xmath2 , which is unmanageable even for small number of users @xmath0 and buffer length @xmath1 .",
    "there are various approaches to deal with delay - aware resource control in wireless networks@xcite .",
    "one approach converts average delay constraints into equivalent average rate constraints using the large deviation theory and solves the optimization problem using a purely information theoretical formulation based on the rate constraints @xcite .",
    "while this approach allows potentially simple solutions , the resulting control policies are only functions of the csi and such controls are good only for the large delay regime where the probability of empty buffers is small . in general , optimal control policies should be functions of both the csi and qsi .",
    "in addition , due to the complex coupling among queues in multi - hop wireless networks , it is difficult to express the average delay in terms of all the control actions .",
    "therefore , it is not easy to generalize this approach to joint resource allocation and routing in multi - hop wireless networks .    a second approach to deal with delay - aware resource control utilizes the notion of _ lyapunov stability _ and establishes _ throughput - optimal _ control policies ( in the stability sense ) .",
    "the throughput - optimal policies ensure the stability of the queueing network if stability can be indeed achieved under any policy .",
    "three classes of policies that are known to be throughput - optimal include the max weight rule @xcite , the exponential ( exp ) rule @xcite and the log rule@xcite . among the three classes , the throughput - optimal property of the max weight type algorithms @xcite and the log rule @xcite",
    "are both proved by the theory of _ lyapunov drift _ , whereas the exp rule is proved to be throughput - optimal by the _ fluid limit _ technique along with a _ separation of time scales _ argument in @xcite .",
    "specifically , the general max weight type algorithms are proved to minimize the lyapunov drift , and hence , are throughput - optimal .",
    "many dynamic control algorithms belong to this type , which include optimizing the allocation of computer resources @xcite , and stabilizing packet switch systems @xcite and satellite and wireless systems @xcite .",
    "the _ lyapunov drift _ theory ( which only focuses on controlling a queueing network to achieve stability ) is extended to the _ lyapunov optimization _",
    "theory ( which enables stability and performance optimization to be treated simultaneously)@xcite .",
    "for example , utilizing the lyapunov optimization theory , the _ energy - efficient control algorithm _ ( eeca ) proposed in @xcite stabilizes the system and consumes an average power that is arbitrarily close to the minimum power solution with a corresponding tradeoff in network delay . in transport layer flow control and network fairness optimization , the cross layer control ( clc )",
    "algorithm was designed in @xcite to achieve a fair throughput point which is arbitrarily close to optimal with a corresponding tradeoff in network delay , when the exogenous arrival rates are outside of the network stability region . in @xcite and @xcite",
    ", the authors consider the asymptotic single - user and multi - user power - delay tradeoff in the large delay regime and obtain insights into the structure of the optimal control policy in the large delay regime .",
    "although the derived policy ( e.g. , dynamic backpresssure algorithm ) by the lyapunov drift theory and the lyapunov optimization theory may not have good delay performance in moderate and light traffic loading regimes , it allows potentially simple solutions with throughput optimality in multi - hop wireless networks . however , throughput optimality is a weak form of delay performance and it is also of great interest to study scheduling policies that minimize average delay of queueing networks .",
    "a more systematic approach in dealing with delay - optimal resource control in general delay regime is the _ markov decision process _ ( mdp ) approach . in some special cases ,",
    "it may be possible to obtain simple delay - optimal solutions .",
    "for example , in @xcite , the authors utilize _ stochastic majorization _ to show that the longest queue highest possible rate ( lqhpr ) policy is delay - optimal for multiaccess systems with homogeneous users .",
    "however , in general , the delay - optimal control belongs to the infinite horizon average cost mdp , and it is well known that there is no simple solution associated with such mdp .",
    "brute force value iterations or policy iterations @xcite could not lead to any viable solutions due to the curse of dimensionality .",
    "in addition to the above challenges , the problem is further complicated under distributed implementation requirements .",
    "for instance , the delay - optimal control actions should be adaptive to both the global system csi and qsi .",
    "however , these csi and qsi observations are usually measured locally at some nodes of the network and hence , centralized solutions require huge signaling overhead to deliver all these local csi and qsi to the centralized controller .",
    "it is very desirable to have distributed solutions where the control actions are computed locally based on the local csi and qsi measurements .",
    "a systematic understanding of delay - aware control in wireless communications is the key to truly embracing both the phy layer and the mac layer in cross - layer designs . in this paper , we give a comprehensive survey on the major systematic approaches in dealing with delay - aware control problems , namely the _ equivalent rate constraint _",
    "approach , the _ lynapnov stability drift _ approach and the _ approximate mdp _ approach using _",
    "stochastic learning_. these approaches essentially embrace most of the existing literature regarding delay - aware resource control in wireless systems .",
    "they have their relative pros and cons in terms of performance , complexity and implementation issues . for each of the approaches ,",

    "we omit the details due to page limit .",
    "[ interpretation of lemma [ lem : littlelaw - drop ] ] lemma [ lem : littlelaw - drop ] establishes the relationship among the average delay , the average queue length and the average drop rate in general networks .",
    "given the average drop rate , the average delay bound for general multi - hop networks or the average delay for single - hop networks is proportional to the average queue length .",
    "thus , the average queue length ( and the average drop rate if data dropping happens ) is commonly used in the existing literature @xcite as the delay performance measure .     moreover , under control policy @xmath47 , the average throughput of link @xmath59 and the average power consumption of node @xmath60 are given by @xmath61 , \\quad \\forall l \\in \\mathcal{l } \\nonumber\\\\   \\overline{p_n}=&\\limsup\\limits_{t\\rightarrow + \\infty}\\frac{1}{t}\\sum\\limits_{t=1}^{t } \\mathbf{e}^{\\omega } \\left [ \\sum_{l\\in \\{l : s(l)=n\\}}\\sum_{c\\in \\mathcal c } p_l^{(c)}(t ) \\right ] , \\quad \\forall n \\in \\mathcal{n } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively , where @xmath62 denotes the power allocated to commodity @xmath31 over link @xmath15 at slot @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , delay - aware resource control problems for wireless networks can be divided into the following three categories :    * * category i : * maximize the average weighted sum system throughput ( or average arrival rate ) subject to average delay constraints , average power constraints and average drop rate constraints .",

    "[ alg : tra - dbp - routing ]            a significant weakness of the above dbp routing algorithm is that it can suffer from very large delays due to the following reasons .    *",
    "first , the traditional dbp routing exploits all possible paths between source - destination pairs ( i.e. , load balancing over the entire network ) to maximize stability region without considering the delay performance .",
    "this extensive exploration is essential in order to maintain stability when the network is heavily loaded .",
    "however , under light or moderate loads , packets may be sent over unnecessarily long routes , which leads to excessive delays .",
    "for example , if a single packet is injected into an empty network , there is no backpressure to suggest an appropriate path .",
    "hence , the packet might take a random walk through the network , or might take a periodic walk that never leads to the destination , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : circulate ] . in this case",
    ", although the network congestion is quite low ( only one packet , i.e. , zero average arrival rate ) , the end - to - end delay can be infinity .",
    "similarly , under light load , the end - to - end delay can be large even though the average queue length is guaranteed to be bounded by the lyapunov drift theory @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to design a throughput - optimal routing which exploits longer paths only when it is necessary . *",
    "second , due to large queue sizes that must be maintained to provide a gradient ( backpressure ) for each data flow , the dbp routing can suffer from very large delays and the queues grow in size with distance from the destination . to obtain some insights on this ,",
    "let us consider a flow traveling through a @xmath0-hop tandem queueing network with @xmath430 nodes , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : tandem_queue ] .",
    "let @xmath431 be the queue length at destination node 0 and @xmath432 be the queue length of the @xmath32-th upstream node from the destination node @xmath433 , where @xmath434 .",
    "set @xmath435 . under the traditional dbp routing algorithm , for a link to be scheduled , the differential backlog associated with it should be positive .",
    "thus , @xmath436 will be some positive number , say @xmath122 , and @xmath437 will be even larger than @xmath122 .",
    "for the purpose of obtaining some insights , let us informally assume @xmath438 , which implies @xmath439 and @xmath440 .",
    "similarly , we can obtain @xmath441 .",
    "thus , the total queue length for the flow under the traditional dbp routing will be @xmath442 @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to design a routing algorithm which can provide a sufficient gradient for each data flow without causing too large delay for each packet .",
    "* finally , the traditional dbp routing specifies a single next - hop receiver before transmission , and hence does not exploit the broadcast advantage of multi - hop wireless networks when wireless channels are unreliable ( e.g. , outage probability without csi ) . due to multi - receiver diversity in wireless channels ,",
    "the probability of successful reception by at least one node within a subset of potential receivers is much larger than that of just one receiver .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to design flexible routing to dynamically adjust routing and scheduling decisions in response to random outcome of each transmission .    given the drawbacks of the dbp routing discussed above , most recent studies try to improve the delay performance of the dbp routing while maintaining its advantage in throughput optimality . in the following ,",
    "we discuss three aspects of delay reduction in dbp routing by utilizing the shortest path concept @xcite , modifying the queueing disciplines @xcite and exploiting receiver diversity over unreliable channels @xcite in wireless multi - hop networks .",
    "one of the major reasons for the poor end - to - end delay performance of the traditional dbp routing algorithms is the extensive exploration of routes .",
    "however , reducing delay by restricting the routing constraint sets to some shorter paths will reduce the stability region . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors try to incorporate the idea of _ shortest path routing _ into traditional dbp routing algorithms in different ways while simultaneously maintaining throughput optimality , which will be illustrated in the following .",
    "the enhanced dbp routing algorithm proposed in @xcite programs a _",
    "shortest path bias _ into the backpressure @xmath443 defined in so that in light or moderate loading situations , nodes are inclined to route packets in the direction of their destinations .",
    "therefore , we call this enhanced dbp routing algorithm _ shortest path bias dbp routing_. specifically , the _ backpressure of link @xmath15 w.r.t .",

    "@xmath445 can be chosen to be proportional to the distance ( or number of hops ) between node @xmath32 to the destination of commodity @xmath31 ( where @xmath446 if node @xmath32 is the destination of commodity @xmath31 ) .",
    "besides the shortest path bias , the shortest path bias dbp routing algorithm is the same as the traditional dbp routing algorithm in algorithm [ alg : tra - dbp - routing ] .",

    "readers could refer to @xcite for a survey on the decomposition method . on the other hand , using the second approach , the one - hop dynamic backpressure algorithm ( m - lwdf ) only requires the local system state information at the transmitter and therefore , the m - lwdf problem can be solved distributively .",
