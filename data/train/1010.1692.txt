    "realizing a micro- or nano - device exhibiting _ absolute negative mobility _ ( anm ) poses serious technological challenges , as this task is believed to require finely tailored spatial asymmetries either in the ( nonlinear ) particle - particle interactions @xcite or , more conveniently , in the geometry of the device itself @xcite .",
    "a device is said to operate in the anm regime , when it works steadily against a biased force , i.e. , a force with nonzero stationary mean . according to the second law of thermodynamics ( or more precisely , the so called principle of le chatelier )",
    ", a static force alone can not induce anm in a device coupled to an equilibrium heat bath , unless an additional time dependent force is applied to bring the system out of equilibrium .",
    "anm is known to occur as a genuine _ quantum mechanical _ phenomenon in photovoltaic materials , as the result of photo - assisted tunneling in either the bulk of noncentrosymmetric crystals @xcite or artificial semiconductor structures @xcite .",
    "however , such manifestations of the anm phenomenon do not survive in the limit of a classical description , so that detecting anm in a purely classical system remains a challenging task .    as spatial symmetry typically suppresses anm , _ ad hoc _ contrived geometries have been proposed to circumvent this difficulty .",
    "the most promising solution devised to date , is represented by two ( 2d ) or three dimensional ( 3d ) channels with inner walls tailored so as to force the transported particles along meandering paths @xcite , a design that can be implemented , e.g. , in superconducting vortex devices @xcite . other classical set - ups advocate elusive dynamic chaotic effects @xcite .",
    "although such finely tuned asymmetric geometries and/or nonlinear dynamic behaviors may seem hardly accessible to table - top experiments , first convincing demonstrations of classical anm have actually been obtained following this strategy @xcite .",
    "we propose here a much simpler , affordable working concept for a classical anm device , by embedding the spatial asymmetry into the shape of the transported particles , rather than in the channel geometry . in view of this new formulation",
    ", the anm mechanism is expected to occur in natural systems , too , where cylindrically symmetric channels in low spatial dimensions and elongated particles are frequently encountered @xcite .",

    "[ f1](a ) , the channel is mirror symmetric with respect to both its longitudinal axis and each compartment wall .",
    "this is an important difference with ref .",
    "@xcite , where the channel confining potential , @xmath15 , was taken to be asymmetric under both mirror reflections  although symmetric under double reflection , @xmath16 .    in order to detect anm ,",
    "the particle must be driven in a pulsating manner parallel to the channel axis .",
    "this means that @xmath17 consists of at least two terms @xcite : a dc drive , @xmath18 , and an unbiased , symmetric ac drive , @xmath19 , with amplitude @xmath20 and temporal period @xmath21 .",
    "accordingly , the waveform of @xmath19 is subjected to the conditions @xmath22 , with @xmath23 and @xmath24 denoting the time average taken over one drive cycle @xcite .",
    "equations ( [ le ] ) have been numerically integrated for an elliptic disk of semiaxes @xmath0 and @xmath1 , under the assumption that the channel walls were perfectly reflecting and the particle - wall collisions were elastic @xcite . in the following we report the outcome of extensive simulations for a fixed channel compartment geometry , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , but different particle elongations , @xmath27 , ac drive waveforms , and ratios of the rotational to translational diffusion coefficients , @xmath28 .",
    "we conclude that anm occurs in such a highly symmetric channel geometry only because of the elongated aspect ratio of the drifting particle .    as illustrated in panels ( b ) and ( c ) of fig .",

    ", the particle rotates away from the walls ; pore crossing is thus controlled mostly by _ translational _ diffusion .    as the magnitude of the applied force",
    "is increased , the mobility of elliptic and circular disks develop a quite different @xmath52 dependence .",
    "the mobility of a circular disk with @xmath61 , @xmath50 , is a concave function of @xmath57 , which decays from @xmath62 to @xmath63 , with a power law slower than @xmath64 @xcite . in the case of an elliptic disk with @xmath2 ,",
    "reaching the escape angle @xmath3 can be regarded as a noise activated process with energy barrier proportional to @xmath52 .",
    "pore crossing will then be controlled mostly by the _ rotational _",
    "fluctuations , with approximate escape time @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the total activation force , the factor 2 accounts for the two directions of rotation , and @xmath67 is the compartment traversal time , @xmath68 , divided by the probability , @xmath69 , that the disk slides through the pore without an additional rotation .",

    "in view of future experimental implementations of the proposed anm mechanism , we now analyze in detail its sensitivity with respect to both the drive and the particle parameters .",

    "[ f3](a ) we plotted @xmath95 also for other , inversion - symmetric waveforms @xmath19 with the same amplitude and period , in particular , sinusoidal and up - down ramped waveforms . for a ramped ac drive , no anm can occur , because in the adiabatic regime @xmath118 for a sinusoidal ac drive , the anm effect can be shown analytically to diminish in magnitude and shrink to a narrower interval @xmath110 than obtained for the corresponding square waveform .",
    "the latter is thus the optimal ac drive waveform to operate an anm device .    to quantify the robustness of this effect against the damping conditions , inertia was added to the model by replacing the l.h.s . in the langevin equations ( [ le ] ) as follows :    [ inertia ] @xmath119    in fig .",
    "[ f3](b ) we compare anm characteristics curves for growing values of the ( rescaled ) particle mass , @xmath120 , and moment of inertia , @xmath121 : anm is gradually suppressed by increasing inertia .",

    "we analyze next how selective the anm effect is versus the geometric and diffusive properties of the transported particles . in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] we displayed the dependence of the net current on the particle elongation .",
    "one notices immediately that , when plotted versus @xmath1 at constant values of the drive parameters , @xmath35 starts out positive and then turns negative for @xmath1 larger than a certain threshold , @xmath122 , which appears to increase with either raising @xmath60 ( figure inset ) or lowering @xmath21 ( main panel ) .",
    "our adiabatic argument provides a simple explanation for these findings , as well .",

    "for @xmath126 the particle flows through the pores , no matter what the orientation , @xmath8 , of its major axis .",
    "therefore , @xmath35 becomes insensitive to the particle elongation ( main panel ) , while retaining its known @xmath60 dependence ( inset ) .",
    "the actual value of @xmath122 is determined by the general anm condition ( [ anm ] ) . on making use of the approximation on the r.h.s .",
