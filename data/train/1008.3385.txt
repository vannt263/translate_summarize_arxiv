    "one of the distinctive features of the phase diagram is the critical point at which the first - order transition between hadron matter and qgp ends .",
    "we currently do not have a systematic way of locating this point from first principles as model and lattice calculations face many challenges and much work still needs to be done in order to overcome them .",
    "( for review , see e.g. ,  @xcite . ) in the meantime , if the critical point is located in a region accessible to heavy - ion collision experiments , it can be discovered experimentally in current and future experiments at rhic , bnl and sps .",
    "it is therefore important to define and select experimental observables that will allow us to locate the critical point , if it is located in an experimentally accessible region .",
    "upon scanning in the center of mass energy @xmath0 and thus in @xmath1 , one should then be able to locate ( or rule out the presence of ) the critical point by using observables that are sensitive to the proximity of the freeze - out point to the critical point  @xcite , such as pion and proton multiplicity fluctuations .",
    "as we vary @xmath0 , if the freeze - out point approaches the critical point , we would see an increase and then a decrease , as we move away from it , in the fluctuations in the number of these particles . in this paper",
    "we describe how to use this non - monotonic behavior in the fluctuations of particle numbers near the critical point as a probe to determine its location .",
    "the critical mode , @xmath2 , is the mode which develops large long wavelength fluctuations at the critical point .",
    "its screening mass is related to the correlation length @xmath3 by @xmath4 . in the case of an infinite system , @xmath3 diverges at the critical point . in reality",
    ", @xmath3 reaches a maximum value at the critical point but does not diverge because as it cools the system spends only a finite time in the vicinity of the critical point .",
    "estimates of the rate of growth of @xmath3 as the collision cools past the critical point suggest that the maximal value of @xmath3 that can be reached is around @xmath5 fm @xcite , compared to the natural @xmath6 fm away from the critical point . near the critical point , the @xmath7 and @xmath8 interaction couplings are given by @xmath9 where the dimensionless couplings @xmath10 and @xmath11 are universal and they have been determined for the ising universality class  @xcite . throughout this paper we shall use @xmath12 and @xmath13 as benchmark values , because these are the midpoints of the ranges of values known for these constants  @xcite .    the long wavelength fluctuations in the @xmath2-field manifest themselves in observable quantities in so far as they affect the fluctuations of the occupation numbers of particles that couple to the @xmath2-field , like protons and pions , which interact with @xmath2 through the effective lagrangian : @xmath14 . throughout this paper",
    "we will use @xmath15 mev ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and @xmath16 ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) as benchmark values .",
    "it is important to bear in mind that both these parameters and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are all uncertain at the factor of 2 level .",
    "the contribution of critical fluctuations to the 2- , 3- and 4- particle correlators due to @xmath2-exchanges is given by ( see refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) @xmath19 @xmath20 equations  ( [ eq:2corr ] ) - ( [ eq:4corr ] ) apply to both protons ( with @xmath21 ) and pions ( with @xmath22 ) .",
    "the degeneracy factor @xmath23 is 2 for both protons and pions since the coupling to the @xmath2-field is both spin and charge `` blind '' .",
    "the variance of the fluctuating occupation number distribution is denoted by @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the relativistic gamma - factor of the particle with a given momentum @xmath26 .      in order to obtain the critical contribution to the cumulants of the particle multiplicity distributions using the correlators given above",
    ", each momentum index needs to be integrated over using @xmath28 a cumulant with @xmath29 protons and @xmath30 pions will be denoted by @xmath31 . in order to remove the @xmath32 dependence of the cumulants we choose to normalize them as @xmath33 we can see from expressions ( [ eq:2corr ] ) - ( [ eq:4corr ] ) that higher cumulants are proportional to higher powers of @xmath3 and",
    "thus increase by a larger factor near the critical point where @xmath3 becomes large .",
    "in the case of free particles in the classical boltzmann regime , with no critical fluctuations , the fluctuations of any particle number obey poisson statistics .",
    "the poisson contribution to @xmath34 and @xmath35 is 1 , and zero for the mixed cumulants @xmath36 . in reality , this 1 of poisson statistics gets few percent contributions from bose - einstein statistics , from system size fluctuations , from initial state correlations that are incompletely washed out , and from interactions other than those with the fluctuations that are enhanced near the critical point .",
    "we are ignoring all of these non - critical corrections to the poissonian 1 .",
    "existing data on the ratio of the fourth to second net proton cumulants , @xmath37 , at @xmath38 , 62.4 and 200 gev  @xcite confirm that the non - critical corrections to the poissonian 1 are indeed small .",
    "we now illustrate _",
    "possible _ experimental outcomes of measurements of the cumulants , assuming that the matter produced at the freezeout point of the fireball evolution for some collision energy @xmath0 is near the critical point . to start ,",
    "let us assume that the critical point occurs at @xmath39 mev and that @xmath40  fm .",

    "we shall define the width @xmath44 as the width in @xmath1 within which @xmath45  fm .",
    "we also use our benchmark values of the four nonuniversal parameters that determine the @xmath36 for a given @xmath3 , namely @xmath46 , @xmath16 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 and we have allowed for the fact that the chemical freeze - out temperature @xmath49 decreases somewhat with increasing @xmath1 by using an empirical parametrization of heavy ion collision data from ref .",

    "they have no @xmath3-dependence , no dependence on the four poorly known parameters , and no @xmath1-dependence .",
