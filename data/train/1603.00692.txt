    "with almost two decades of efforts , a considerable progress in constraining the neutrino mixing parameters has been achieved @xcite , based on various oscillation experiments with atmospheric , solar , and terrestrial neutrinos @xcite .",
    "it is now well established that the flavor states @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are superpositions of the vacuum mass eigenstates @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 @xcite and the three mixing angles , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , and two mass - squared differences , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are well constrained .",
    "however , the neutrino mass hierarchy , i.e. , the sign of mass squared difference @xmath15 , remains undetermined .",
    "although various techniques have been proposed to resolve the neutrino mass hierarchy , this question remains open to date and represents an important challenge in particle physics .",
    "recent efforts on resolving the neutrino mass hierarchy include works based on reactor neutrinos @xcite different baseline experiments @xcite , earth matter effects on supernova ( sn ) neutrino signal @xcite , spectral swapping of sn neutrino flavors @xcite , rise time of sn @xmath5 light curve @xcite , @xmath5 and @xmath2 light curves on the early accretion phase @xcite , analysis of meteoritic sn material @xcite , and detection of atmospheric neutrinos in sea water or ice @xcite .    among various proposals to identify neutrino mass hierarchy ,",
    "intensive efforts have been devoted to studying neutrinos from galactic sne . as these neutrinos",
    "propagate outward , they can experience significant flavor transitions before arriving at the terrestrial detectors .",
    "the flavor conversions caused by the well - known mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) effect @xcite depends on the neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "in addition , it has been suggested that , due to the large neutrino number density in the deep region of the core , coherent @xmath16 forward scatterings may lead to collective flavor conversion @xmath17 ( @xmath4 ) over the entire energy range . this collective effect on the flavor transition of sn neutrinos",
    "depends crucially on the neutrino mass hierarchy and may also leaves imprints on the neutrino spectra .",
    "most of the methods that use sn neutrinos for determining the neutrino mass hierarchy are based on the interactions of these neutrinos with atomic nuclei and free protons .",
    "the major interaction channel for neutrino detection is the inverse beta decay ( ibd ) , @xmath18 .",
    "while the liquid scintillation detector is sensitive to @xmath2 , the liquid argon detector has a good sensitivity to @xmath5 via charged - current interactions @xmath19 .",
    "while @xmath5 and @xmath2 spectra have been intensively studied for understanding the physics of sn , the potential of utilizing other species of sn neutrinos as the tool is much less discussed .",
    "the detection of other species of sn neutrinos was proposed by measuring the neutral - current ( nc ) interactions , @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that , under fairly optimistic assumption about the detector and sn neutrino flux , signals due to @xmath21 elastic scatterings at scintillation detectors allow one to reconstruct @xmath22 spectrum and measure total neutrino energy to a precision @xmath23 @xcite .    in this work , we introduce an approach to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy , based on the interactions of sn neutrinos with free protons in scintillation detectors .",
    "the method is to explore how the inverse beta decays and neutral current interactions in single scintillation detector are related for different neutrino mass hierarchies .",
    "we provide calculations with contemporary inputs of several detectors : the presently - running borexino @xcite and kamland @xcite , the near - term sno+ @xcite , and the much larger proposed juno @xcite and lena @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we review the supernova neutrino fluence",
    ". the flavor transitions of sn neutrinos are discussed as they propagate outward from the deep inside the supernova and traverse the earth medium to reach the detector . in sec .",
    "iii , we define interaction spectra of inverse beta decay and neutral current and illustrate how to derive the interaction spectra from observations of scintillation detectors . then , in sec .",
    "iv , we present our calculations for considered detectors with statistical uncertainties addressed . in sec .",
    "v , we extend our approach to the time - dependent sn neutrino flux assuming a scenario of the time evolution of sn neutrino luminosities . we summarize and conclude in sec . vi .",
    "a sn emits a total energy @xmath24 erg over a burst @xmath25 in neutrinos of all six flavors .",
    "the neutrino flavors @xmath6 , @xmath7 and their antiparticles have similar interactions and thus similar average energies and fluences . therefore , the total energy is divided as @xmath26 . in general , equipartition of energies among the primary neutrino flavors",
    "is expected in typical sn simulations , @xmath27 and also @xmath28 for luminosities , which is assumed in our calculation .",
    "the primary sn neutrino energy spectrum is typically not purely thermal .",

    "we take a representative supernova at the galactic center region with @xmath40 , and a total energy output of @xmath41 , i.e. , @xmath42 for each of the 6 flavors .",
    "further , we choose @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "[ fluence ]      our knowledge on the neutrino flavor transition in a core - collapse sn suggests that the flavor conversion can be induced by the collective neutrino oscillation @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) and msw effect .",
    "the collective oscillation results from the coherent @xmath16 forward scatterings in the deep region of the core where neutrino densities are large and may lead to collective pair conversion @xmath17 ( @xmath4 ) over the entire energy range even with extremely small neutrino mixing angles .",
    "the msw effect , instead , arise from neutrino interaction with ordinary stellar medium . in a typical sn",
    ", the collective flavor conversions would take place near @xmath46 while those of msw type would take place at @xmath47 .",
    "as the collective and msw effects are widely separated , they can be considered to be independent of each other .",
    "recently , substantial progress has been made on the studies of neutrino collective flavor conversions .",
    "the most prominent feature arising from collective neutrino oscillations is the spectral swap / split .",
    "analytical and numerical works have shown @xcite that collective effects not only depend on neutrino parameters , sn environments , and primary neutrino spectra but also subject to the oscillation modes and simulation approaches one has chosen .",
    "however , recent study based on multi - angle analysis of sn neutrinos @xcite found that the seemingly dominant collective effects may be suppressed by the dense matter during the accretion phase following the core bounce @xcite .    unlike the status of msw effects , consensus on collective flavor transitions",
    "has not yet been reached . to avoid digression to diverse scenarios of the collective effect",
    ", we assume that msw effect dominates the flavor conversions when sn neutrinos propagate outwards .",
    "we will also neglect the complicated effects during the cooling phase since we are mainly interested in the time - integrated flux .      as neutrinos propagate outwards from deep inside sn and finally reaches the earth ,",
    "their flavor contents are modified by the msw effect .",
    "let us denote the survival probability for @xmath48 after the msw effect as @xmath49 .",

    "the probability @xmath64 is usually written as @xmath65 , with @xmath66 the regeneration factor due to the earth matter effect @xcite : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the number of layers for the earth mass density , @xmath69 is the potential difference between adjacent layers of matter , and @xmath70 is the phase acquired along the trajectories .",

( [ enh ] ) to ( [ ebarih ] ) , it is shown that , in the normal hierarchy , @xmath5 completely comes from @xmath75 from the source while @xmath2 comes from both @xmath76 and @xmath77 . on the other hand , in the inverted hierarchy , @xmath5 comes from both @xmath78 and @xmath75 while @xmath2 completely comes from @xmath77 .",
    "it is also shown that earth matter effects occur on @xmath2 in the normal hierarchy and @xmath5 in the inverted hierarchy .    in this section ,",
    "we discuss interactions of sn neutrinos in liquid scintillation detectors . in scintillation detectors ,",
    "inverse beta decays ( ibd ) are the most dominant interactions .",
    "the yield of @xmath21 elastic scatterings is also comparable to that of ibd due to the large number of free protons @xcite .",

    ", one has @xmath83 for @xmath84 as indicated in @xcite . in the energy regime of sn neutrinos , this allows the event spectrum @xmath82 to be directly converted to the interaction spectrum @xmath85 with cross section @xmath86 taken from @xcite .",
    "sn neutrinos interact with free protons in the detector through neutral current elastic scattering , producing protons with recoil kinetic energies @xmath87 . to produce a proton recoil energy @xmath87 requires a minimum neutrino energy @xmath88 , with @xmath89 the proton mass .",
    "in other words , a neutrino of energy @xmath90 can produce a proton recoil energy between @xmath91 and @xmath92 . these protons are slow",
    "hence they are detected with quenched energies @xmath93 .",
    "the proton recoil energy @xmath87 is mapped to an electron - equivalent quenched energy @xmath94 through the quenching function @xmath95 where @xmath96 is birks constant @xcite .",
    "the observed event spectrum for nc interactions is actually the effective proton spectrum @xmath97 a measured @xmath98 corresponds to a unique @xmath87 using the known quenching function .",
    "the energy @xmath87 is then related to @xmath99 via @xmath88 mentioned before .",
    "once the quenched spectrum @xmath100 is measured , one can extract the neutrino fluence @xmath101 with the inversion process described in @xcite .",
    "the spectrum for neutral current interactions , @xmath102 , is then given by eq .",
    "( [ ncspec ] ) .    besides ibd and nc signals , there are still other interactions between sn neutrinos and scintillation materials",
    ". neutrinos of all flavors also interact with electrons via @xmath103 .",
    "the recoil kinetic energies of the scattered electrons range from @xmath91 to @xmath104 . unlike the proton recoil energy , the electron recoil energy is not quenched .",
    "these @xmath105 elastic scatterings can be detected directly by measuring the recoiled signals @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , neutrinos also interact with carbon nuclei . by neutral current interactions",

    "emit a positron with a maximum kinetic energy of @xmath112 and an electron with a maximum kinetic energy of @xmath113 , respectively .",
    "though it is difficult to distinguish between these two kinds of charged current events , both channels can be detected by the space and time coincidence of the scattering and its following decay .",
    "in addition to these neutrino interactions with carbon nuclei , which can be distinguished from recoil signals by identifying their unique characteristics , neutrinos can also produce protons by interacting with carbon nuclei by so - called proton knockouts @xcite , @xmath114 we note that the @xmath105 scattering signals can mix with the proton recoil signals .",
    "the range of the electron recoil energy from @xmath91 to @xmath115 is broader than the range of the proton recoil energy from @xmath91 to @xmath116 while their events are comparable .",

    "the @xmath105 scattering , together with proton knockout interactions only make up a small fraction of @xmath118 of the signals within the energy range of quenched proton recoils @xcite . for simplicity , we neglect it in this paper .",
    "we point out that not all signals within the energy range of proton recoils are taken into account .",
    "since the scintillator is made of hydrocarbon , a natural isotope of the carbon , @xmath119 , decays into @xmath120 , emitting electrons below @xmath121 mev with a high rate . below this energy ,",
    "the signal is flooded by the above background electrons .",
    "therefore , a threshold of @xmath122 is set for recording the signal .",

    "signals are recorded only for neutrinos with energies above this @xmath99 .",

    "hence , detecting only nc interactions can not distinguish neutrino mass hierarchies .",

    "[ fig : interaction ] , one can see that the spectrum of nc is higher than that of ibd in the entire energy range for the normal hierarchy . on the right panel , it is seen that the spectrum of nc remains higher than that of ibd at low energies and becomes lower than that of ibd for @xmath124 for the inverted hierarchy .",
