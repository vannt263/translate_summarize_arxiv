    "the _ ulysses_/ket ( _ kiel electron telescope _ ) and pamela ( _ payload for antimatter matter exploration and light - nuclei astrophysics _ ) missions overlapped between july 2006 and june 2009 , measuring galactic proton intensities at earth and along _ ulysses_ orbit during most of the unusual solar minimum of cycle 23/24 .",
    "together with _",
    "voyager_-1 observations in the outer heliosphere during this period , this created an opportunity to study the global radial and latitudinal gradients with a comprehensive three - dimensional ( 3d ) modulation model .",
    "examining the main features of this model and relating them to the mentioned observations is the main purpose of this study .",
    "the model was applied previously to reproduce proton and electron spectra from pamela from mid-2006 to the end of 2009 so that the modulation conditions and parameters are set for this period as described in detail by @xcite ( @xcite , @xcite ) and @xcite . for an independent modelling investigation of this unusual period ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "numerical models can be used to compute intensity gradients at any position in the heliosphere .",
    "these gradients are known as local gradients and can unfortunately not be used to compare with gradients calculated from observations , which are mostly far apart in terms of radial and meridional distances ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "such gradients are usually a mixture of radial and latitudinal gradients and are known as global gradients .",
    "these are calculated from differential intensities between , for example , the position of earth and that of _ ulysses _ in the inner heliosphere , or _",
    "voyager_-1 beyond @xmath0au @xcite .",
    "numerical models are easily adjusted to compute global gradients , exactly as is done with observational data ( _ e.g. _ @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "to do so , the basic approach of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite is followed , which makes for an appropriate comparison between the computed and observational gradients .",
    "this study also provides insight into the role that particle drifts had played during the unusual minimum period of cycle 23/24 , in particular why the recent gradients seem smaller than what was predicted for this magnetic polarity cycle ; see the reviews by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "first , the numerical model is briefly discussed together with the essential modulation parameters .",
    "this is followed by a discussion of the reproduced pamela proton spectra @xcite and the computed radial - intensity profiles from the earth to the heliopause ( hp ) for the period from 2006 to 2009 .",
    "this is compared to _",
    "voyager_-1 observations as it moved through the outer heliosphere , for kinetic energies [ @xmath5 between @xmath6mev and @xmath7mev @xcite . in the following sections ,",
    "we discuss how the global spatial gradients are computed based on cosmic - ray ( cr ) intensities from pamela at the earth and along the orbit of _ ulysses_. the computed radial and latitudinal gradients are presented as a function of rigidity , and it is shown how these spatial gradients developed from 2006 to 2009 .",
    "the computed gradients from the model are then compared to corresponding calculated observational values .",
    "a comprehensive 3d modulation model is used to compute differential intensities of protons at the earth and throughout the heliosphere , and it is based on the numerical solution of the transport equation from @xcite :    @xmath8    with @xmath9 the particle distribution function , and @xmath10 the time where @xmath11 , since we address modulation during solar minimum when modulation parameters change gradually .",
    "the terms on the right - hand side represent convection , with @xmath12 the solar wind ( sw ) velocity ; averaged particle drift velocity @xmath13 caused by gradients , curvatures , and heliospheric current sheet ( hcs ) drifts in the global heliospheric magnetic - field ( hmf ) ; diffusion , with @xmath14 the symmetric diffusion tensor ; then adiabatic energy losses , with @xmath15 the rigidity in gv .",
    "contained within @xmath14 are three diffusion coefficients ( dcs ) as discussed below . with the dcs related to the mean free paths [ mfps ; @xmath16 by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the particle speed , the equation for the dc parallel to the average background hmf , at a radial distance of @xmath19 , polar angle @xmath20 and azimuthal angle @xmath21 , is given in general by @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 here",
    "@xmath25 is a scaling constant in units of @xmath26s@xmath2 , @xmath27 the magnetic - field magnitude in nt , @xmath28 the ratio of particle speed to the speed of light , and @xmath15 as before .",
    "the variables @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 determine the shape of the rigidity dependence of the mfp , which has the functional form of two power laws combined ; see @xcite for a list of their values .",
    "the constants @xmath33nt and @xmath34gv keep @xmath35 and @xmath36 dimensionless .    the expression for the hmf is modified according to @xcite and is given by @xmath37 with @xmath38au , and @xmath39 a function of @xmath19 and @xmath20 given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a normalization constant that ensures that the hmf has the value @xmath42 at earth , @xmath43 the angular velocity of the sun , and @xmath44 the sw speed . with the solar radius @xmath45au , the value @xmath46 and the ratio @xmath47 are constants that determine the hmf modification . for a complete description and study of these types of modifications ,",
    "see @xcite .    for diffusion perpendicular to the hmf ,",
    "a rigidity dependence similar to that of @xmath48 is assumed below 4gv , but with a slightly weaker dependence of @xmath49 above 4gv .",
    "this is in line with what is required from basic turbulence theory ( see also @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "following @xcite , a distinction is also made between the radial [ @xmath50 and polar [ @xmath51 diffusion by scaling the former by @xmath52% of parallel diffusion and the latter by @xmath53% .",

    "equation ( [ eq : h_perp_theta ] ) enhances @xmath64 towards the heliospheric polar regions as motivated by @xcite ; see also related discussions by @xcite ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite illustrated that particle drifts contributed to the high intensities observed by pamela in 2009 .",
    "the rigidity and spatial dependence for the drift coefficient that they used is given by @xmath65 which reduces drifts below @xmath66gv with respect to the weak scattering case , which is simply proportional to @xmath67 ( for an elaborate discussion on this topic , see * ? ? ?",
    "this is required to explain the small latitudinal gradients observed by _",
    "ulysses _ at low rigidities ; see also @xcite , @xcite , and for supportive theoretical discussions , see @xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows the rigidity dependence of the four sets of mfps and the drift scales [ au ] as applied in the model to reproduce the aforementioned pamela spectra .    .",
    "parallel mfps [ @xmath68 are given by the solid lines , while perpendicular mfps in the radial [ @xmath69 and polar [ @xmath70 directions are given by the dashed and dashed  dotted lines , respectively .",

    "see equations ( [ eq : kappa_parallel ] ) , ( [ eq : kappa_perp_r ] ) , ( [ eq : kappa_perp_theta ] ) , and ( [ eq : kappa_a ] ) .",
    "[ fig : prot_dc ] ]    furthermore , the hcs tilt angle [ @xmath72 and the hmf at earth [ @xmath42 ] are modulation parameters that influence both diffusion and drift . as an attempt to account for the time - dependent changes that occur in these parameters",
    "while using a steady - state model , realistic modulation conditions for each of the selected 27-day averaged pamela spectra were set up in the model .",
    "these aspects are described and explained in detail by @xcite .    additionally ,",
    "because of the dynamic nature of the global heliosphere ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the position of the ts is also varied with solar activity in the model .",
    "since this expands or shrinks the heliosheath , it affects the modulated intensities in the outer heliosphere , and even slightly at earth ; see @xcite for an example of the effects of an oscillating heliosheath width on crs .",
    "the hp is positioned at 122 au in the model to make it consistent with the reported _ voyager_-1 observation ( @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) . in our model",
    "the dcs are reduced inside the heliosheath , but with the same spatial dependence as in the rest of the heliosphere , except when the hp is approached , where they decrease exponentially to account for the upward jumps in the cr intensity across the hp region observed by _",
    "voyager_-1 @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated in the next section .",
    "adiabatic energy losses in the heliosheath are treated as in the rest of the heliosphere . by accounting for all of the above variables in the model , and carefully adjusting the dcs ,",
    "each consecutive year - end pamela proton spectrum was reproduced satisfactorily , as we show next .",
    "reproducing the mentioned pamela spectra is the departure point of the rest of our investigation .     for the periods 2006e , 2007e , 2008e , and 2009e as described in the text .",
    "corresponding computed spectra are also shown in the equatorial plane ( polar angle @xmath74 ) at 10au , 50au , 100au , and 120au by the blue lines .",
    "the lis from @xcite , given by the grey line , is specified in the model at 122au.[fig : prot_es_fit ] ]",
    "four 27-day averaged pamela proton spectra are reproduced , namely for november 2006 , december 2007 , december 2008 , and december 2009 , referred to as the 2006e , 2007e , 2008e , and 2009e spectra , respectively , where the suffix `` e '' denotes the end of the year .",
    "these are shown in , along with the computed spectra .",
    "the model reproduces the behaviour of these galactic proton spectra at all energies of interest to solar modulation studies .",
    "it is also clear that the proton spectrum became progressively softer from 2006 to 2009 , reaching a maximum intensity of @xmath75particles@xmath76m@xmath77sr@xmath78s@xmath78mev@xmath2 at the end of 2009 , with an accompanying shift of the spectrum peak down to @xmath79mev .",
    "below @xmath80mev the modulated spectra bend into the characteristic @xmath81 slope as a result of adiabatic energy losses caused by the expanding sw , which is the dominant process at non - relativistic proton energies ( below @xmath80mev  @xmath82mev ) .",
    "predictions of intensity levels can be made with the model for energies below 80mev , where pamela measurements are unavailable . at @xmath83mev ,",
    "the 2006e intensity is estimated at @xmath84 particles@xmath76m@xmath77sr@xmath78s@xmath78mev@xmath2 increasing to @xmath85 particles@xmath76m@xmath77sr@xmath78s@xmath78mev@xmath2 at the end of 2009 .",
    "corresponding computed spectra in the equatorial plane of the heliosphere ( polar angle / co - latitude of @xmath74 ) are also shown at 10au , 50au , 100au , and 120au in relation to the newly constructed very local interstellar spectrum ( vlis ) for protons from @xcite , specified at 122au where the hp is located .",
    "see also @xcite for new liss that are based on pamela and _",
    "voyager_-1 observations .",
    "the computed spectra at larger radial distances show how the maximum in the spectra progressively shifts to lower energies .",
    "protons below 100mev experience a significant amount of modulation , even at large radial distances close the hp . the displayed radial dependence of the spectra is discussed in more detail below .",
    "the focus in this section is on the spatial distribution of proton intensities , which is investigated to obtain a better global view of the behaviour of crs throughout the heliosphere during the unusual minimum - modulation conditions of cycle 23/24 .",

    "observations during december 2007 , at 105au , and december 2009 , at 112au , in the top and bottom panels are slightly lower than the computed intensities .",
    "this is expected since _",
    "voyager_-1 at this distance essentially measured intensities that correspond to earlier modulation conditions closer to the sun . measurements of 182mev protons beyond 100au ( middle panel ) are consistent with the modelling results , showing the increase in intensities with increasing distance .    over the last @xmath925au region in front of the hp ( indicated by the shaded region ) , _",
    "voyager_-1 measured a pronounced increase in intensities ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) when it entered the so - called heliosheath depletion region , now recognized as the heliopause region , after which it started to observe the vlis from august 2012 onward ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this jump - like increase is interpreted as a particle barrier - region over which the sw begins to interact with the very local interstellar medium ( lism ) causing crs to jump up to the very local interstellar values over a relatively short distance .",
    "this jump - effect is also simulated and discussed by @xcite , who considered how the mfps should scale over this region ; obviously , the smaller dcs inside the heliosheath must increase sharply across the hp to match the very lism values as shown by them .    in additional _ voyager_-1 and -2 measurements for 155mev",
    " 245mev protons are shown as a function of radial distance from 1998 to 2011 , including the 2009 minimum @xcite .",
    "since observations between 1997 and 2000 were made during an @xmath93 polarity cycle , they are expected to be lower than intensities from an @xmath94 cycle , which is the case when comparing the computed radial profiles with _ voyager_-1 measurements at radial distances of 53au  61au and _ voyager_-2 observations at 68au  78au .",
    "the difference in the computed proton fluxes between these two trajectories is quite small , so that the _ voyager_-2 profiles are not plotted .",
    "the development of proton intensities during the maximum of solar cycle 23 can be followed by the fainter segments of these lines .",
    "solar minimum observations from the @xmath94 polarity cycle between 2006 and 2011 are shown at distances of 97au  115au and 81au ",
    "93au for _ voyager_-1 and -2 , respectively .",
    "evidently , the observed radial profiles , set into the right context , are consistent with the computed profiles for the period 2006 to 2009 .",
    "it seems reasonable to claim that these computed radial profiles for this period are a good representation of the galactic cr intensities throughout the heliosphere during the unusual solar minimum period of cycle 23/24 .",
    "gradient and curvature drifts of crs in the heliosphere are recognized as the pre - eminent driving force behind the 22-year cr solar cycle .",
    "the effects of drifts on galactic crs during different polarity epochs can be measured in the radial [ @xmath95 and latitudinal [ @xmath96 global gradients , which give distinct , but not invariant , results for each solar cycle ; characteristically , drifts cause negative latitudinal gradients during @xmath94 epochs @xcite .",
    "@xcite used measurements from pamela and _",
    "ulysses_/ket to investigate the radial and latitudinal gradients of protons in the inner heliosphere during the @xmath94 solar minimum leading up to 2009 . for the rigidity interval @xmath97gv",
    " @xmath98gv , they found a radial gradient of @xmath99%au@xmath2 and a latitudinal gradient of @xmath100%degree@xmath2 , with the latter less negative than the large negative latitudinal gradients predicted by earlier drift models @xcite .",
    "in hindsight , this was an indication that the modulation conditions during the minimum of cycle 23/24 were different and not indicative of drifts being overall less important in heliospheric modulation , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "this study aims to calculate @xmath101 and @xmath102 for the recent solar minimum using the computed intensities as described above .",
    "in addition , for comparison with pamela and",

    ", numerical models can be used to compute very precise local radial and latitudinal gradients for a given position anywhere in the heliosphere , which illustrate the unique modulation characteristics of drifts ( @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) . however , these local gradients are not useful if a meaningful comparison needs to be made with observations at vastly different locations in the heliosphere .",
    "it is assumed that the temporal and spatial variations of cr intensities are separable in time and space @xcite .",

    "it is clear that the model reproduces the overall trends in these ratios quite satisfactorily , with some differences between the model and measurements noticeable at @xmath130gv during 2006 , and at @xmath131gv and @xmath128gv between 2008 and 2009 .",
    "the effect of drifts is evident from the marked increase in intensity during 2007 , when _ ulysses _ performed its fls .",
    "when positive particles drift inward mainly along the hcs during an @xmath94 cycle , it results in higher intensities in the equatorial regions relative to the off - equatorial latitudes .",

    "first , the modelling results are shown in figure 8 as a function of rigidity , with @xmath101 and @xmath102 given in the top and bottom panels , respectively .",
    "this is provided for every year , and it serves to illustrate how these spatial gradients had developed in the inner heliosphere during this remarkable solar minimum modulation period .",
    "the model evidently produces positive radial and negative latitudinal gradients , as expected from drift theory for protons in an @xmath94 cycle . in the context of gradient predictions by drift - dominated models ,",
    "@xmath101 for this study is larger than reported before , while @xmath102 is less negative , but still distinctively negative .",
    "according to this approach , the model predicts that the largest @xmath101 between the earth and the position of _ ulysses _ occurred during 2009 , with a maximum of @xmath134%au@xmath2 around @xmath135mv .",
    "the smallest @xmath101 is found for 2007 because @xmath118 varied significantly during 2007 , when _ ulysses _ performed its fls .",
    "this makes our assumption that @xmath101 and @xmath102 are independent in terms of time and space less accurate .    for the latitudinal gradients ,",
    "the most negative value is found for 2009 , with @xmath136%degree@xmath2 around @xmath3mv , while the least negative @xmath102 is found for 2007 .",
    "a characteristic of the model is that these gradients decrease significantly below @xmath137mv because drifts decrease toward lower rigidities , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "this illustrates that when drifts are reduced , the negative latitudinal gradients will dissipate .",
    "the reason for the difference in computed gradients for each of the four years is displayed in figure 1 and was discussed in detail by @xcite and @xcite .        in figure 9",
    "the modelling results from figure 8 are compared to the observational gradients calculated in this study and to observational gradients from @xcite and the very recent study of @xcite .",
    "the latter investigation used a more sophisticated approach , producing two sets of results for global gradients based on two statistical fitting methods , as indicated in the figure .",
    "the original study of @xcite reported gradients for @xmath97gv ",
    "@xmath98gv protons only ( diamond symbols ) and was based on preliminary proton spectra from pamela .",
    "more recent observational gradients are based on the final proton spectra as published by @xcite .",
    "our calculated observational gradients are consistent with @xmath101 and @xmath102 values reported by other authors , taking error bars into account .",
    "most important , from our modelling point of view , good agreement is found between the observational global gradients ( symbols ) and modelled global gradients ( lines ) over the rigidity range considered here .",
    "the global modulation produced by the model is compatible with the global modulation observed during the period from 2006 to 2009 .",
    "given that a complicated analysis of observations is required for this type of study , as discussed in detail by @xcite , we refrain from speculating why some differences are present .",
    "the reported pamela proton spectra observed between mid-2006 and the end of 2009 enabled us to perform a comprehensive modelling study of cr modulation during this unusual solar minimum period , as reported by @xcite ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and extended by @xcite .",
    "a newly constructed vlis was used as an input spectrum that takes into account recent _",
    "voyager_-1 observations at low energies . based on these studies",
    ", the conclusion was made that the minimum - modulation period of 2009 was relatively more diffusion - dominated instead of being drift - dominated as previous @xmath94 polarity cycles seem to have been .",
    "see also the assessment of solar minimum spectra by @xcite , and their conclusion that the 2009 pamela proton spectrum was the highest recorded in the space era .",
    "the studies mentioned here illustrate that drifts played a notable role , especially because the hmf had decreased significantly until the end of 2009 , in contrast to the moderate decreases observed during previous minimum periods .    for this article , we began by using the model of @xcite , with the parameters tuned to reproduce four year - end pamela proton spectra .",
    "we applied the model to compute the radial dependence of the proton spectrum throughout the heliosphere for 2009 .",
    "corresponding radial profiles were also computed for each year , from 2006 onwards , along the _ voyager_-1 trajectory , and compared to available observations .",
    "it is found that the computed intensity levels are in good agreement with solar minimum observations from _",
    "voyager_-1 at multiple energies .",
    "in addition , the model also reproduces the steep intensity increases observed when _",
    "voyager_-1 crossed the hp region .",
    "this increase was comprehensively simulated with an independent model by @xcite . in this context",
    ", we conclude that our model gives a most reasonable presentation of the cr radial profiles , from the earth to the hp , for 2006 to 2009 .",
    "simultaneous observations from _ ulysses_/ket and pamela , between july 2006 and june 2009 , were made available , allowing for a study of the radial and latitudinal gradients in the inner heliosphere . to ensure a meaningful comparison between our modelling results and observations , we applied an empirical method , similar to that of @xcite and @xcite , to our modelling results at the earth and along _ ulysses_ orbit for this period .",
    "we find good agreement between the computed values from the model and those calculated from observations , for both the radial and latitudinal gradients .",
    "we conclude that the model also gives a most reasonable representation of spatial gradients in the inner heliosphere for 2006 to 2009 .",
    "our computations reflect that drifts influenced cr modulation during this unusual solar minimum , so that the notion that drifts were unimportant during the recent solar minimum ( _ e.g. _ @xcite , @xcite ) is not supported .",
    "even though the observable effects of drifts are somewhat suppressed by the excess diffusion , drifts still maintained a strong presence , as explained by @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the drift effects shown here with a model tuned to the special conditions during the 2006 to 2009 solar minimum are indeed weaker then previous predictions of drift - dominated models for @xmath94 cycles ; see also the review by @xcite .",
    "evidently , nobody had foreseen that the minimum - modulation conditions for the @xmath94 cycle of 2009 would be so different and unusual .",
    "it follows from our simulations for the period 2006 to 2009 that drifts had the strongest effect on global latitudinal gradients in the inner heliosphere ( as covered by _",
    "ulysses _ ) in the rigidity range of @xmath138gv ",
    "@xmath139gv , but this subsided rather quickly with decreasing rigidity .",
    "the most negative latitudinal gradient is computed for 2009 , with a value of @xmath136%degree@xmath2 around @xmath3mv .",
    "the highest value for the global radial gradient in the inner heliosphere is @xmath134%au@xmath2 around @xmath135mv in 2009 as well .",
    "the authors express their gratitude to the south african national research foundation ( nrf ) for providing partial funding .",
    "ee vos also thanks the south african national space agency ( sansa ) for partial financial support during his phd studies .",
    "they thank jan gieseler for insightful discussions during his visit to south africa and for providing them with updated _ ulysses _ observations .",
    "they also thank mirko boezio , valeria di felice , and riccardo munini as members of the pamela team for many insightful discussions on the pamela data ."
