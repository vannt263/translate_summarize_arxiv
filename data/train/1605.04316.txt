    "more precisely , we propose that for some specific large enough @xmath16 c ( ) ,   ( ) [ sing ] will be divergent at the critical point in the thermodynamically - large system at zero absolute temperature .",
    "the singularity of ( [ sing ] ) follows from the defining feature of a quantum phase transition : non - analyticity of the ground - state energy at the quantum critical point ( ch .",
    "1.1 of @xcite ; see also @xcite for a pleasant introduction to quantum phase transitions ) .",
    "we proceed in the standard way to verify this claim .",
    "we introduce the ground - state energy @xmath17 , note that @xmath18 is a function of @xmath19 only , use the feynman - hellman theorem = || , [ fh ] and take into account that    var ( ) , [ p2 ] where @xmath20 is the number of lattice sites . the 2d square lattice geometry and unit filling factor",
    "are assumed in equations ( [ p1 ] ) and ( [ p2 ] ) , respectively .",
    "the translational invariance of the ground state is also assumed in these equations .",
    "generalization of equations ( [ p1 ] ) and ( [ p2 ] ) to other lattice geometries and filling factors is straightforward .    using equations ( [ fh][p2 ] )",
    "one finds that c ( ) = - [ dn_1 ] and ( ) = - 2 .",
    "[ dn_2 ]    as the quantum critical point is traditionally associated with non - analyticity of the ground - state energy , we assume that the derivatives of the ground - state energy with respect to the parameter driving the transition , @xmath21 are continuous for @xmath22 and either divergent or discontinuous at the critical point for @xmath23 .",
    "the question now is which derivative of the ground - state energy should we expect to be divergent ? to answer this question , we note that the quantum phase transition of the 2d bose - hubbard model lies in the universality class of the classical 3d xy model @xcite , whose singular part of the free energy scales with the distance @xmath24 from the critical point as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 equals about @xmath27 @xcite . following the discussion in ch .",
    "1.7 of @xcite , we write @xmath28 , where @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) is the free energy for @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) , which has been analytically continued to the complex @xmath24 plane .",
    "non - analyticity at the critical point is then seen by non - zero derivative(s ) of @xmath33 at @xmath34 .",
    "the third and higher derivatives of @xmath33 are divergent at the critical point of the classical 3d xy model .",
    "going back from the classical 3d xy model to the quantum 2d bose - hubbard model , we expect that the third derivative of the ground - state energy will be singular .",
    "this translates into the divergent second derivative of both nearest - neighbor correlation function and variance through ( [ dn_1 ] ) and ( [ dn_2 ] ) , respectively .",
    "such singularity of @xmath35 and @xmath36 is expected to develop in the limits of temperature @xmath37 and the system size @xmath38 . for finite systems instead of",
    "a singularity either an extremum or a kink smoothing out discontinuity should develop near the critical point for small enough temperatures .",
    "we will now discuss the observables that we use for finding the critical point .",
    "* observables . *",
    "the correlation functions @xmath39 are arguably the most experimentally accessible correlation functions in cold atom systems .",
    "it is so because their fourier transform provides a quasi - momentum distribution of cold atom clouds , which can be extracted from the time - of - flight images @xcite ( see @xcite for measurements in the 2d bose - hubbard system ) .",
    "the critical point can be extracted from these correlation functions through the study of their decay with the distance @xmath40 between the lattice sites .",
    "they are expected to decay exponentially in the mott phase and algebraically in the superfluid phase in the thermodynamically - large zero - temperature system .",
    "such a strategy of finding the critical point in the 2d bose - hubbard model is problematic because the exponential vs. algebraic transition is expected to happen for large @xmath40 distances .",
    "such distances are hard to deal with in theoretical calculations because the model is not exactly solvable and it does require substantial computational resources to handle moderate lattices sizes . on the cold atom experimental side , one has to face issues with accurate measurement of distant correlation functions .",

    "the curves from bottom to top ( in the left part of the plot ) correspond to temperatures @xmath43 equal to @xmath44 ( black ) , @xmath45 ( red ) , @xmath46 ( green ) , respectively .",

    "this technique allows for the detection of @xmath48 atoms in individual lattice sites . choosing the sites far away from the borders of the trap",
    ", one should be able to minimize the influence of finite - size effects , which should facilitate extraction of the critical point from the experimental data .",
    "the derivatives of the two observables , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , are proportional to each other @xcite = 4 c ( ) , so it suffices to measure either one of them .",
    "therefore , we would like to stress that the measurements of either @xmath35 or @xmath36 are possible in the current state - of - the - art experimental setups .",
    "in fact , the measurements of @xmath35 have been possible since the seminal paper of greiner _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "it is thus a little bit surprising that nobody has studied the derivatives of at least @xmath35 to obtain unambiguous signatures of a superfluid - mott insulator quantum phase transition .",
    "the idea to find the critical point through the expectation values ( or thermodynamical averages in classical phase transitions ) of different terms of the hamiltonian is quite natural and has been explored before ( see e.g. @xcite in the context of classical and @xcite in the context of quantum phase transitions ) . to the best of our knowledge , however , _",

    "looking at fig .",
    "[ var_fig ] , we see that for the lowest temperature displayed , @xmath75 , there is a steep increase of the variance around the critical point ( [ critical ] ) .",

    "moreover , we observe that @xmath73 at the maximum grows with both the system size ( fig .",
    "[ size_fig ] ) and the inverse of the temperature ( fig .",
    "[ temp_fig ] ) .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to ask whether the studied maximum is in fact the singularity that is rounded off and shifted away from the critical point by finite - size effects . to investigate it",

    "there is the point where @xmath101 , i.e. , where the maximum of @xmath73 is located .",
    "thus , in the thermodynamic limit the divergent discontinuity of @xmath93 will be located at the same point as the maximum of @xmath73 ( if that would nt be the case , then there would be two points where @xmath93 is non - analytic , which would contradict presence of a single critical point in the system ) .",
    "this observation explains why the non - singular in the thermodynamic limit maximum of @xmath73 encodes the position of the critical point so accurately .",
    "the extrapolated thermodynamic - limit singularity of @xmath93 implies the singularity of the third derivative of the ground - state energy ( [ dn_2 ] ) , which agrees with the above - presented discussion based on the scaling theory of phase transitions .",
    "it is worth to stress that it is so because the critical exponent @xmath102 .",
    "such an exponent can be directly experimentally measured near the lambda transition in liquid @xmath103he , which also belongs to the universality class of the classical 3d xy model ( see e.g. @xcite reporting the outcome of an experiment done in a space shuttle to eliminate the influence of gravity on the transition ) . on the theoretical side",
    ", one can obtain this exponent through the hyperscaling relation linking it to more commonly studied critical exponents @xcite = 2-(d+z ) , [ alpha ] where @xmath104 is the exponent providing algebraic divergence of the correlation length , @xmath105 is the dynamical exponent relating the excitation gap to the inverse correlation length , and @xmath106 is the dimensionality of the quantum system . in our system @xmath107 and @xmath108 and so @xmath109 for @xmath110 . since the critical exponent @xmath104 is nearly @xmath111 in the 2d bose - hubbard model , its accurate determination is needed to find out whether @xmath26 is a little bit smaller or greater than zero .",
    "had the latter possibility been realized , the second derivative of the ground - state energy ( the first derivative of either variance or nearest - neighbor correlation function ) would have been divergent .    finally , we mention that the standard expectation coming from the finite - size scaling theory is that thermodynamic - limit singularities are rounded off and shifted away from the critical point by the distance @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is an integer multiple of @xmath114 @xcite . fitting the position of the maximum ( minimum ) of @xmath93 with ( [ fit ] ) , we obtain @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 ( @xmath80 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 ) .",
    "thus , we see that the fitting parameter @xmath120 roughly matches integer multiples of @xmath121 in the 2d bose - hubbard model @xcite .",
    "the same conclusion applies to the finite - size scaling of the position of the maximum of @xmath73 ; see the fitting results right below ( [ fit ] ) .",
