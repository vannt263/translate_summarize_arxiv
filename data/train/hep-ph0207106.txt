    "however the applicability of this method have met many theoretical problems .",
    "recently , this modified pqcd approach ( or say pqcd approach for simplicity ) was largely applied in exclusive b decays to treat the endpoint singularity @xcite .",
    "there has been much debate concerning the applicability of pqcd approach in b system @xcite . in @xcite , we investigated the reliability of pqcd approach in @xmath12 form factors and find that the soft contribution coming from large transverse separations can be comparable with the hard contribution .",

    "from the analysis in the light - cone sum rule approach , the soft endpoint contribution is found to be large at the experimentally accessible energy region @xcite .",
    "so , the study of the reliability of pqcd approach in em pion form factor is necessary and important .",
    "it is well - known that the leading order ( lo ) result for pion form factor with asymptotic leading - twist distribution amplitude ( da ) is small , about @xmath13 to @xmath14 of the experimental data @xcite .",
    "the recent next - to - leading order ( nlo ) calculation is given in @xcite .",
    "their conclusion is that nlo calculation is reliable only when @xmath15 .",

    "we find that intrinsic transverse momentum in pion wave function are important .",
    "however , the large twist-3 correction shows that the power corrections may not be systematically calculated in pqcd framework .",
    "the pion em form factor is defined by the following lorentz decomposition of biquark current matrix element ( p^)|j_(0)|(p)= ( p+p^)_f_(q^2 ) where @xmath17 is the electromagnetic current with quark flavor @xmath18 and relevant electronic charge @xmath19 .",

    "the basic idea of pqcd approach is that it takes into account transverse momentum and sudakov suppression .",
    "the pion em form factor is expressed as the convolution of wave functions @xmath25 and hard scattering kernel @xmath26 by both the longitudinal momentum faction and the transverse impact parameter @xmath27 : [ eq : pqcd1 ] f_(q^2)=dx   dy   d^2 b  d^2 b   (x , b , )   (y , b , )   t_h(x , y , b , b , q , ) . the wave function @xmath28 is given by : [ eq : p ] (x , b , q , ) = exp[-s(x , b , q , ) ] ^0(x , b ) where @xmath29 is the soft part of pion wave function with @xmath30 [ eq : wave ] ^0(x , b)=(x , 1/b)+o((1/b ) ) the above equation is valid for small @xmath27 . when sudakov suppression is strong , there is only small @xmath27 contribution and the approximation of @xmath29 by distribution amplitude @xmath31 is valid .",
    "but at a few @xmath32 region , this approximation is questionable .    the factor exp(-s ) in eq.([eq : p ] ) includes the sudakov logarithmic corrections and renormalization group evolution effects of both wave function and hard kernel , s(x , b , q , ) = s(x , b , q)+s(1-x , b , q)- where @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "the sudakov exponent @xmath35 is calculated up to next - to - leading - log ( nll ) accuracy .",

    "the study of distribution amplitudes beyond leading twist is expanded in the conformal spin @xcite .",
    "the light - cone distribution amplitudes of pion are defined in terms of bilocal operator matrix element [ eq : pionwavefunctions ] ( p)||q_(z ) q_|0 = _ 0 ^ 1 dx e^i x pz \\ { _ 5 _ ( x ) - _ _ 5 ( _ p(x ) - _ p^z^ ) } _ , where @xmath38 is the decay constant of pion and @xmath39 is the longitudinal momentum fraction of quark in pion .",

    "the choice of renormalization scale parameter @xmath56 is taken as the largest momentum scale associated with the exchanged virtual gluon in the longitudinal and transverse degrees,=max(q , 1/b , 1/b ) the above choice avoids the landau pole in coupling constant @xmath57 at @xmath58 if @xmath59 and @xmath60 are small .    in @xcite , the transverse momentum associated with virtual fermion lines",

    "the modified pqcd approach uses a b - space resummation formalism in which the sudakov double logarithms are resumed to all orders .",
    "there is a difficulty of matching the resumed formalism and the fixed order predictions in the standard approach . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the modified pqcd approach should be consistent with standard approach when @xmath24 is large enough .",
    "because of the existence of endpoint singularity at twist-3 level , twist-3 contribution can not be calculated in the standard approach .",
    "we can compare the predictions of pqcd approach and standard approach in leading twist , i.e. , @xmath80 and @xmath81 to check the consistence .",
    "the physical quantity @xmath82 does not depend on the choice of the scale parameter @xmath56 if the calculation can be performed up to infinite orders .",
    "however , in practice the calculation can only be made perturbatively at finite orders . to make the perturbative expansion reliable ,",
    "the scale parameter should be chosen in such a way that make the higher order corrections as small as possible . in pqcd",

    "one can see that the best choice of @xmath56 in the standard approach is @xmath86 or @xmath87 . by using this choice ,",
    "pqcd approach is consistent with the standard approach when @xmath88 . for the momentum transfer @xmath89 ,",
    "the prediction of pqcd approach is generally smaller than that in the standard approach .",
    "this difference is caused by the transverse momentum effects and sudakov suppression . in @xcite",
    ", it is found that the choices of @xmath90 reduce the nlo corrections significantly and reliable predictions can be obtained at lower values of @xmath24 . both these results show the importance of choosing the scale by the interior dynamics of the process .",
    "now we discuss the reliability of pqcd approach .",
    "the basic idea of pqcd approach is to use sudakov form factor to suppress the long - distance contributions coming from large transverse separations .",
    "a reliable perturbative computation should satisfy that most of the results are coming from small impact parameter @xmath27 . in order to study the impact parameter @xmath27 dependence of form factor @xmath82",

    "( [ eq : formulae ] ) by @xmath92 .",
    "similarly , the impact parameter @xmath61 dependence can also be performed .",
    "it is convenient to use @xmath93 as the physical quantity for discussion because @xmath93 is nearly a constant for large q. the results are plotted in fig.2 .",
    "we can see that the results are saturated before @xmath91 approaches to @xmath94 , which means large separation is suppressed by sudakov effect .",
    "the saturation point is closer to @xmath94 for smaller momentum transfer . for @xmath95",
    "the saturation point is at about @xmath96 , which is far from the end point @xmath94 .",
    "this means that almost all the contributions come from the short - distance region . for @xmath97 ,",
    "the saturation point is at about @xmath98 , which shows that some non - perturbative contribution emerges , but it is still not large .",
    "but for @xmath99 and @xmath100 , the saturation points are at @xmath101 and @xmath102 , which are quite close to the end point @xmath94 . there are substantial contributions coming from large transverse separations @xmath103 for @xmath104 .",
    "sudakov suppression becomes weak for small @xmath24 , and non - perturbative contribution becomes large .",
    "to show directly how the non - perturbative contribution becomes large at small momentum transfer , we show the @xmath65 dependence of @xmath105 in fig.3 .",
    "we see that there are quite large contributions coming from the region @xmath106 for smaller values of @xmath65 : 34% at @xmath107 , 22% at @xmath108 , 18% at @xmath109 . for @xmath110",
    "the contribution for @xmath106 becomes smaller than 10% .",
    "is sudakov suppression effective at experimental accessible energy region ( @xmath111 ) ? from the above results , it seems that sudakov suppression is not strong enough for @xmath104 .",
    "sudakov form factor @xmath112 only suppress the region of @xmath113 at a few @xmath32 region . in the derivation of b - space",
    "resumed sudakov form factor , it requires the condition @xmath114 . the condition @xmath115 is required because a reliable @xmath116 expansion needs small @xmath27 .",
    "this is possible only if @xmath24 is large enough and sudakov form factor suppress all the large @xmath27 contributions . the derivation of sudakov form factor is a difficult problem in qcd because perturbative expansion is not meaningful at long - distance .",
    "this is unlike the case in qed .",
    "thus , sudakov form factor depends on the infrared cut - off .",
    "thus , b - space resummed sudakov form factor is not the unique choice .",
    "moreover , the extrapolation of asymptotic form into the small momentum region is not under well control in qcd .",
    "the predictive power of perturbation theory will be decreased largely by this extension .",
    "the model - dependent nonperturbative effects have to be included in order to extrapolate the perturbative analysis to the large @xmath27 region with the cost that the predictive power of perturbative method is decreased . in the pion",
    "em form factor , the non - perurbative contribution at small @xmath24 can be at the order of 30% .",
    "this means that sudakov suppression is not strong enough for small momentum transfer .",
    "other mechanisms , such as intrinsic transverse momentum effects @xcite and threshold resummation @xcite can suppress large @xmath27 contribution and endpoint contribution .",
    "we investigate whether these effects can provide a reliable perturbative analysis . about the intrinsic transverse momentum effects",
    ", it is nonperturbative .",
    "the estimate of this effects must be model - dependent at present .",
    "the suppression of the intrinsic transverse momentum effects is larger than sudakov effects at the order of a few @xmath32 . only for very large @xmath24 ,",
    "sudakov suppression becomes strong and the intrinsic transverse momentum effects can be neglected .",
    "we incorporate these effects to suppress the nonperturbative contributions .",
    "the formula of including these effects can be found in @xcite . here",
    ", we do not present them for simplicity .",
    "fig.4 shows the numerical result after incorporating these effects .",
    "the result is seriously suppressed by intrinsic transverse momentum effect in pions wave functions , and slightly suppressed by threshold resummation , which shows that intrinsic transverse momentum effect is important in pion em form factor .",
    "we should include them in our analysis .",
    "fig.5 shows that the perturbative behavior is improved largely .",
    "the saturation points in @xmath27-space moves to the @xmath117 direction apparently for both small and large value of @xmath24 .",
    "the contribution of @xmath106 is largely reduced . for @xmath118",
    ", the contribution of @xmath106 is suppressed below a few percent . however , for @xmath119 there are 10% to 20% of the contributions coming from the region @xmath106 .",
    "non - perturbative contribution for small @xmath24 region is still non - negligible .",
    "so pqcd can not predict pion em form factor precisely in small momentum transfer region . for large momentum transfer region ,",
    "the non - perturbative contribution is small and pqcd can be applied .",
    "> from the phenomenological point of view , we can use pqcd approach to estimate the hard contribution .",
    "the pqcd approach is valid in perturbative regions where the strong coupling constant @xmath120 be small . in order to estimate the hard contribution",
    ", one should make a criterion that a perturbative contribution should satisfy although it is very hard to define such a criterion quantitatively .",
    "in general perturbative contribution should come from the region with small strong coupling constant @xmath121 . to make our analysis proceed numerically , we set a criterion for perturbative contribution : @xmath122 . this criterion can not be understood as an absolute one",
    ", it is only indicative .",
    "a more stronger criteria may be more reliable but may lose some hard contributions .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table 1 gives the numerical results which satisfy @xmath122 . from it",
    ", it is seen that the perturbative contribution is about @xmath123 for @xmath62 with lo twist-2 and twist-3 corrections .",
    "compared with the experimental data for @xmath124 , the results in table 1 are not too bad .",
    "considering the large error bars in the present experimental data , we can not conclude that soft contribution in pion em form factor at small @xmath65 region can be neglected .",
    "about 20% percent soft contribution at small momentum transfer region is still allowed . for @xmath125 ,",
    "the soft contributions is larger than 30% , thus pqcd can not be applied in this energy region . on the other hand",
    ", the results in table 1 can not be viewed as the self - consistent prediction of pqcd because we set @xmath122 in getting them . only for large @xmath65",
    ", the results with the constraint @xmath122 can be very near to the full pqcd prediction . as @xmath65 becomes large soft contribution decreases very fast",
    ", hard contribution seriously dominates .",
    "table 1 also shows that contribution of twist-3 is large for small @xmath65 , it becomes to be smaller as @xmath65 being larger .",
    "about power correction , it may contain both hard and soft contributions from a general point of view . in pion form factor",
    ", we find a large twist-3 contribution which is enhanced by the endpoint region in pqcd approach .",
    "the large twist-3 contribution means that twist expansion may be questionable .",
    "because sudakov suppression is weak at low momentum transfer @xmath24 , the soft contribution can not be suppressed effectively . whether twist-3 contribution is large or small",
    "should be checked by other complementary non - perturbative method in order to guarantee the validity of twist expansion .    at last ,",
    "we briefly compare our perturbative analysis with the prediction from the qcd sum rule . there is a major problem about ope ( operator product expansion ) in the early three - point qcd sum rule so that qcd sum rule is hold for @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the borel parameter which is at the order of @xmath128 @xcite . at this energy region ,",
    "the factorization of the hard and soft dynamics is generally difficult or impossible . in the light - cone sum rules ,",
    "the expansion is carried out by twist of hadrons so that comparison of the perturbative framework and light - cone sum rule becomes possible .",
    "a systematic analysis of pion form factor including the radiative corrections in the light - cone sum rule approach is provided in @xcite .",
    "they found that the soft endpiont contribution is dominant and the hard contribution is very small .",
    "our analysis also shows lo twist-2 hard contribution is very small .",
    "but the calculation of the hard part of twist-2 contribution is different in these two approaches in principle . in pqcd approach ,",
    "the momentum of exchanged gluon is determined by the longitudinal and transverse momentum of the quarks in the two pions .",
    "the lo calculation is at the tree level . in the light - cone sum rule ,",
    "the lo order is soft endpoint contribution and the nlo radiative corrections contains hard and soft contributions .",
    "there is a certain seeming correspondence between the single - gluon exchange diagram in pqcd approach and a diagram of radiative corrections in the light - cone sum rule approach .",
    "however , they are not equivalent . in general , the loop corrections are basically different from tree level calculation . in loop corrections ,",
    "the momentum is arbitrary and the result has ultraviolet divergence and infrared divergence .    in conclusion ,",
    "in large momentum transfer region , say @xmath129 , non - perturbative contribution is small , em pion form factor can be self - consistently calculated by pqcd approach . while , in small momentum transfer region , @xmath130 , sudakov suppression becomes weak , non - perturbative contribution can not be completely suppressed .",
    "there is always at least 20% soft contribution left in pqcd prediction if we use the soft criterion @xmath131 .",
    "this soft contribution breaks the self - consistence of pqcd approach .",
