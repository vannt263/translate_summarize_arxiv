    "tight correlations between the mass of supermassive black holes and the properties of their host galaxies @xcite suggest a co - evolution triggered by merging events . at the lower end of the black hole mass range , @xmath2 , where dwarf galaxies and bulges of late type spirals  among other sources  are located , such correlations are less clear @xcite .",
    "for example , pseudobulges , barred galaxies and narrow line seyfert 1s ( nlsy1s ) appear to lie below the @xmath3 relation established for higher mass systems @xcite , which has been interpreted as a sign of evolution triggered by secular processes and/or not fully grown systems @xcite .",
    "intermediate mass black holes at the center of galaxies ( imbhs ; @xmath4 ) constitute ideal cases for tracing the behavior of these correlations at the low - mass end .",
    "the characteristics of this population are of particular interest for studying galaxy evolution and to put constraints on models of primordial black hole seed formation @xcite .    during the past decade , imbhs and",
    "their hosts have been studied in the optical  mainly from _ sdss _ data , but recently also with images taken with wfpc2 on _ hst _  and in the x - rays @xcite .",
    "we make use of the high angular and spectral resolution that can be achieved in the near - infrared ( nir ) when assisted by adaptive optics systems , to discover an imbh candidate at the center of the starburst / seyfert composite galaxy iras  01072 + 4954 ( @xmath5 ) . in the optical ,",
    "this source displays only narrow emission lines and is classified as a transition object in the baldwin - phillips - terlevich diagnostic diagram @xcite .",
    "this means that the main ionizing source of the emitting species could be star formation , an active nucleus ( seyfert 2 ) or both .",
    "however , in the x - ray domain , it shows an emission typical of seyfert 1 agn : steep power - law photon - spectral index ( @xmath6 ) and very low hydrogen column density ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "long- and short - term x - ray flux variations were also detected @xcite .    in our analysis of its nuclear nir emission ( @xmath8 pc )",
    ", we find that the main reason for the ambiguous classification is the faintness of the agn @xcite .",
    "the low bolometric luminosity , @xmath9 , combined with a very low @xmath10 produces broad emission lines that are very faint and narrow , and therefore not detectable in the optical spectrum taken by moran et al .",

    "the predicted flux and width of the h@xmath12 broad component are @xmath13 and _ fwhm_@xmath14 ( determined using the expressions from @xcite ; see @xcite for details ) .",
    "nevertheless , this mini - agn seems to accrete at a high rate , @xmath15 , which makes it comparable to other nlsy1s ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the black hole mass determination using k - band integral field observations of the bulge of this galaxy . in the following sect.[sec : obs ] , we briefly present the data . in sect.[sec :",
    "phot ] , we show the construction and fitting of the surface brightness profile and discuss the probable presence of an inner structure  disk or bar . the fitting of the line - of - sight velocity distribution of the stars in the bulge is presented in sect.[sec : kyn ] .",
    "finally , in sect.[sec : mbh ] we use those photometric and kinematical measurements to estimate the black hole mass via scaling relations and discuss the results .",
    "conclusions are presented in sect.[sec : fin ] .",
    "the central @xmath16 of iras  01072 + 4954 was observed on october 2008 with the near - infrared integral field spectrometer nifs @xcite mounted on the `` frederick c. gillett '' gemini north telescope on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "the adaptative optics ( ao ) module altair was used in laser guide star mode .",
    "nifs has a @xmath17 field of view and provides high spatial and spectral resolution simultaneously .",
    "the observations cover the h- and k - bands , although in this paper we refer only to the k - band data . the spatial resolution achieved with",
    "the ao in the k - band was @xmath18 , which corresponds to 72pc on source .",
    "the instrumental spectral resolution is @xmath19 .",
    "the data was reduced using the gemini iraf package ( released version 2.14 , of september 15 , 2008 ) and standard iraf tasks .",
    "absolute flux calibration and extinction corrections were also applied to the data cubes .",
    "the 2mass @xcite provides nir images that cover the whole galaxy . however , in the k - band",
    ", the source is very faint  at the center only @xmath20 times brighter than the background and has a small radius,@xmath21 , so that a proper 2d photometric modeling is not possible .",
    "we also notice that the bulge size is about the same as the 2mass k - band point - spread function ( psf ) , meaning that it is not resolved in the 2mass image .",
    "therefore , we combine the 2mass with our nifs data to construct a 1d surface brightness profile ( fig.[fig : prof ] ) .",
    "we model the bulge as a sersic profile with an effective radius @xmath22 and index @xmath23 .",
    "the disk is described by an exponential profile with scale radius @xmath24 .",
    "a gaussian with the width of the nifs psf represents the emission from the agn and the hot dust at the center .",
    "the photometric parameters resulting from the best fit of these three components are : @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 with central surface brightness @xmath28 .",
    "k - band brightness profile of iras  01072 + 4954 obtained by the combination of the nifs ( squares ) and 2mass ( circles ) data .",
    "the dashed red line corresponds to a sersic profile fitted to the bulge , and the dash - dotted green line to an exponential function that fits the disk component .",
    "the dotted magenta line represents the agn + hot dust contribution , while the solid blue line show the overall fit .",
    ", scaledwidth=58.0% ]    the presented model is only a first approximation to the description of the surface brightness .",
    "there are two main reasons foo believing that the bulge contribution found in this way is overestimated .",
    "first , the two data sets do not properly overlap with each other .",
    "assuming that the nifs data represent the bulge of the galaxy reasonably well , and that the emission from @xmath29 of the 2mass image corresponds to the disk , we convolve the sersic model to the resolution of the nifs data and the exponential function to the one of the 2mass image .",
    "however , these components are not independent of each other and the disk contribution at the center might be underestimated .",
    "the second one is that iras  01072 + 4954 is a barred galaxy , and although the bar does not seem to dominate the emission at the center  as we show in the following  , its contribution has not been taken into account in the axially symmetric averaged 1d profile .      at first glance ,",
    "the nir surface brightness of iras  01072 + 4954 in the 2mass and in the nifs data look smooth and uniform . in order to recognize the presence of sub - structures in the disk or in the bulge",
    ", we use the unsharp masking method .",
    "it essentially consists of subtracting a smoothed image of the galaxy from the original one , and adjusting the smoothing function to strengthen the compact structures .",
    "figure[fig : bar2mass ] shows in the second panel the result of this process applied to the @xmath30 2mass k - band image ( first panel ) .",
    "the subtracted image was convolved with a 2d gaussian with a width of @xmath31 .",
    "an elongated structure , that resembles a bar , emerges at the center .",
    "to evaluate how significant this elongation is , we compare its shape with the 2mass psf ( image at the bottom right corner on the second panel ) . fitting elliptical 2d gaussians to both shapes , we obtain axis ratios ( @xmath32 ) of 1.00 for the psf , and 1.68 with orientation @xmath33 for the central structure .",
    "this seems to indicate that the shape is intrinsic to the sub - structure .",
    "however , the sizes are comparable , implying that the bar - like feature is not resolved in the 2mass image .",
    "_ left panel : _ @xmath34 k - band surface brightness distribution of iras  01072 + 4954 from the 2mass image .",
    "_ right panel : _ result of the unsharp masking procedure applied to the image .",
    "a star in the field that represents the 2mass psf is shown at the bottom right.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]     same as in fig.[fig : bar2mass ] but for the @xmath35 nifs image .",
    "the residuals in the right panel are obtained after the removal of the strong psf contribution ( see text for details).,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    when the same procedure is applied to the @xmath35 nifs image , the agn and hot dust emission at the center dominate the residuals .",
    "their contribution corresponds to the psf , which is assumed to be well described by the image of a star close to the field of view . to remove this emission ,",
    "the psf is subtracted from the k - band continuum image by the maximum amount possible such that the residual image is still smooth at the center .",
    "then , the unsharp masking procedure is applied convolving the image with a gaussian of @xmath36 .",
    "the second panel in figure[fig : barnifs ] shows the results . in the first panel",
    "the k - band continuum image , created by taking a median of the nifs data cube over the wavelength range , is shown .",
    "the unsharp masking method reveals an elongated structure .",
    "the faint and more extended emission at the center probably corresponds to residuals of the psf subtraction . when fitting the elongated feature with a 2d gaussian , we find that the axis ratio @xmath37 and the orientation @xmath38 are comparable to the values found previously with the 2mass data .",
    "this allows us to suspect that both residuals are related to the same sub - structure . in this case , the sensitivity of the observations is not high enough to obtain a better map of it , and for the same reason , can not be resolved . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : barnifs ] , its surface brightness is on average @xmath39 .",
    "this is the same brightness as the one observed in the continuum image at about 1arcsecond from the center . although it is unlikely that its contribution would change by much more than about one order of magnitude our estimation of the bulge luminosity , an exact estimation is not possible because we are missing all emission fainter than @xmath40  which includes the disk  in the nifs observations .",
    "we derive the line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) of the stars in the photometric bulge , by fitting a set of high angular resolution stellar templates to the spectrum integrated over an aperture of @xmath41 , which corresponds to the scale radius of the bulge found above .",
    "we assume that the stellar losvd can be described by a truncated gauss - hermite series parametrized by the radial velocity @xmath42 , the velocity dispersion @xmath43 , and coefficients of the third and fourth hermite polynomials @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the deep and narrow co absorption features at @xmath46 and @xmath47 indicate that the velocity dispersion of the stars in the bulge is low .",
    "this implies that , despite the high spectral resolution of the nifs data , it is not possible to constrain significantly all the losvd parameters simultaneously @xcite . in this cases",
    ", one would like to bias the solution towards the pure gaussian one and , in that way , avoid the coupling of the parameters , @xmath42 with @xmath44 and @xmath43 with @xmath45 .",
    "the penalized pixel fitting routine ( ppxf ) of cappellari and emsellem @xcite applies such procedure , allowing to recover the losvd in moderately low signal - to noise ( @xmath48 ) and/or undersampled data .",
    "this routine minimizes the difference between the galaxy spectrum and the combination of the stellar templates convolved with the losvd .",
    "the algorithm allows different weights of the stellar templates .",
    "we use a subset of the gemini spectroscopic library of nir stars observed with the nifs ifu in k - band @xcite . to reduce the effects of the template mismatch , we select the stellar types that match best the absorption features in both h and k bands by comparing the galaxy spectrum with medium resolution stellar templates of ivanov et al . @xcite .",
    "the selected set of stellar spectra consists of 7 objects of the following types : k2iii , k5ib , k5ii , k5iii , m2iii , m3iii and m5iii .",
    "fit of the stellar kinematics of the spectrum integrated over an aperture @xmath49 .",
    "the observed spectrum is shown as a thin solid line , while the red solid line represents the best fit to the losvd .",
    "the small spectral regions delimited by the vertical green lines correspond to two h@xmath50 emission lines , which were masked for the fit .",
    "the residuals , shown at the bottom , are shifted vertically for clarity .",
    ", scaledwidth=58.0% ]    figure[fig : coppxf ] shows the best fit of the losvd with the parameters : @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the fit is obtained after adopting a @xmath55 and the addition of a legendre polynomial of degree 10 . in a conservative approach ,",
    "the errors are calculated via monte carlo simulations , where 1000 realizations of an input spectrum are fitted with the ppxf routine without any penalization ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the input spectrum is created by convolving a stellar template with the losvd and adding poisson noise to the level of the galaxy spectrum , in this case , to reach @xmath57 .",
    "then , the effects of undersampling are simulated allowing the velocity scale ( @xmath58 per pixel ) of the input spectrum to vary in such a way that the second moment of the losvd , found by fitting the spectrum with the ppxf routine , varies in the range @xmath59 .",
    "given the moderate @xmath48 of the data and that @xmath43 is low compared to the velocity scale ( less than two pixels ) , the higher moments @xmath44 and @xmath45 of the losvd suffer from large uncertainties .",
    "fitting only the first two moments we obtain @xmath60 and @xmath61 , which are within the estimated errors .",
    "though the bar - like structure is barely detected photometrically , the kinematics of the stars very close to the center are clearly affected by its presence . to elaborate a map of the stellar losvd , we bin the data in apertures with three different sizes that have @xmath62 per bin .",
    "then , we fit the losvd of the spectra integrated in every aperture using the ppxf routine , and combine the results .",
    "this procedure gives us a first estimate of the stellar velocity field ( fig.[fig : losvd ] ) .",
    "special care has to be taken when interpreting the maps because the combination procedure smooths the velocity gradients , and the error of the values increases with the distance to the center .",

    ", there is a clear evidence for an internal structure with @xmath64 . to get a better estimation of the rotation curve and the uncertainties , we simulate long slits of @xmath65arcsec width that cross the center with different orientations .",
    "the data of every slit are binned to have the maximum number of points with @xmath48 in the range 10 - 20 .",
    "finally , the ppxf routine is applied tuning the bias in every single bin to obtain the best fit and the uncertainties in each case .",
    "the third panel in fig.[fig : losvd ] shows the derived rotation and dispersion curves for the slit oriented along the highest los velocity gradient ( @xmath66 ) and those for the slit perpendicular to it .",
    "the fact that the velocity dispersion is dominated by the bar - like structure implies that the @xmath43 estimated above is an upper limit .",
    "the mass of the black hole at the center of galaxies has been found to correlate with some properties of the host galaxy bulge . however , barred galaxies show a higher scatter around the scaling relations defined by normal disk galaxies or follow a different relation @xcite .",
    "it seems that the vertical resonances and/or instabilities responsible for the formation of bars can affect dramatically the velocity distribution of the stars , and favor the development of pseudobulges @xcite .",
    "here we use the derived upper limits of the stellar velocity dispersion and the k - band bulge luminosity to estimate the black hole mass @xmath10 . the validity of the scaling relations used is also discussed .",
    "table[table : mbh ] summarizes the different black hole mass estimations .",

    "however , when looking at the location of these sources in the @xmath10 vs. @xmath43 diagram ( their fig  1 . ) , the 8 galaxies with dynamically detected black holes lie well within the scatter of the correlation depicted by the full sample ( 49 sources ) . nevertheless , the @xmath10 calculated with the relation fitted to the whole sample is two orders of magnitude lower than the one obtained by using only barred galaxies ( + 18 upper limits ) .",
    "the authors also assign a probability of 0.1809 to the case of the upper limit sources not having a black hole .",
    "in contrast , the same probability stated for the full sample is 0.0004 .",
    "we conclude that the difference between the two estimations is introduced by the inclusion of the upper limits to the fit which , in the case of the barred galaxies , dominate the subsample .",

    "this of course is related to the sample selection , the method applied to fit the data , and the treatment of the errors .",
    "the question of whether the emission detected in the nifs data corresponds to a classical bulge or to a pseudobulge is still open .",
