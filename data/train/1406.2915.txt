    "we shall approach the different systems mentioned in the title as instances of the typical linear case of a general space - time operator equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 comprises given data , @xmath2 denotes the derivative with respect to time , @xmath3 is a  usually  purely spatial operator and the quantities @xmath4 are linked by a so - called material law @xmath5 then the closed operator sum in question is @xmath6 . as a matter of `` philosophy '' , for the way we like to think about this problem class , the material law operator @xmath7 is encoding the complexity of the physical material , whereas @xmath3 is kept simple and usually only contains spatial derivatives . if @xmath7 commutes with @xmath8 we speak of an autonomous system , a case which we will focus on here as a matter of simplification ( for a treatment of non - autonomous problems see @xcite ) .",
    "a prominent feature distinguishing general operator equations from those describing dynamic processes is the specific role of time , which is not just another space variable , but characterizes dynamic processes via the property of causality .",
    "requiring causality for the solution operator @xmath9 results in very specific types of material law operators @xmath7 , which are causal and compatible with causality of @xmath9 .",
    "this leads to deeper insights into the structural properties of mathematically viable models of physical phenomena .",
    "causality suggests to think of prescribed initial data , which can be achieved by extending the solution theory canonically to temporal distributions with values in a hilbert space . in this perspective",
    "considering an initial value problem , i.e. prescribing @xmath10 , amounts to allowing a source term @xmath1 of the form @xmath11 defined by @xmath12 for @xmath13 in the space @xmath14 of continuous @xmath15-valued functions with compact support .",
    "this source term encodes indeed the classical initial condition @xmath16 .    throughout",
    ", the scalar field of any hilbert space @xmath15 under consideration is the field of complex numbers , although we shall implicitly consider this type of hilbert space occasionally as a real hilbert space in so far as we consider positivity with respect to the corresponding real inner product @xmath17 derived from the actual inner product @xmath18 of @xmath15 .",
    "note that inner products , indeed any sesquilinear forms , are assumed to be conjugate - linear in the first component and linear in the second component .",
    "taking maxwell s equations as a starting example , we recall that these describe the evolution of the electro - magnetic field @xmath19 in a @xmath20-dimensional open set @xmath21 . as gauss s law",
    "can be incorporated by a suitable choice of initial data , we think of maxwell s equations as being composed of two separate laws of which the first is faraday s law of induction ( the maxwell - faraday equation ) , which reads as @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the ( distributional ) @xmath24 operator in @xmath25 with the electric boundary condition .",
    "@xmath26 , the magnetic induction , satisfies the constitutive equation @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the magnetic permeability .",
    "faraday s law is complemented by ampere s law @xmath29 for @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 being the external currents , the electric displacement and the induced current , respectively .",
    "the latter two quantities satisfy the two equations @xmath33 the former is a constitutive equation involving the dielectricity @xmath34 and the latter is ohm s law with the conductivity @xmath35 .",
    "plugging the constitutive relations and ohm s law into faraday s law of induction and ampere s law and arranging them in a block operator matrix equation , we arrive at @xmath36    the above form of maxwell s equations is actually due to o. heaviside , which is therefore sometimes referred to as the maxwell - heaviside system .",
    "maxwell used a formalization based on quaternions , which were discovered independently by o. rodrigues ( 1840 ) and a. hamilton ( 1843 ) . following the formal implications of the quaternion calculus t. ohmura , @xcite , appears to have been the first to suggest explicitly an extended maxwell system , which , as a by - product , allowed to incorporate charge preservation into the system of maxwell s equations , without causing overdeterminancy , compare also @xcite . this system in turn coincides in its euclidean ( non - quaternionic ) form with a system proposed by dirac , @xcite , for the construction of electrodynamic potentials in the presence of magnetic and electric charges .",
    "although dirac has developed his equations from a direct formal calculation to find a first order factorization for the klein - gordon operator , the dirac equation is easily recognized as of quaternionic nature ( the pauli matrices multiplied by the imaginary unit @xmath37 together with the identity form a unitary quaternion basis ) .    a variant of the previously discussed extensions of the maxwell system has been proposed in a quaternionic framework as a linearized version of the gravitation equations by a. singh , @xcite . for this approach the label",
    "gravito - electromagnetism or gem has been used , compare e.g. @xcite as a more recent reference .",
    "the initiating idea , however , dates back to o. heaviside , @xcite .",
    "an independent strand of development is rooted in the use of alternating differential forms for the formulation of the maxwell - heaviside system .",
    "the rigorous investigation of initial boundary value problems for maxwell s equations in the alternating differential form setting goes back to h. weyl , @xcite , and k. o. friedrichs , @xcite .",
    "we mention in passing that , as noticed by n. weck , the differential forms framework proved to be essential in showing a compact resolvent result for the spatial derivative operator of maxwell s equations in the case of non - smooth boundaries , see @xcite .",
    "such types of results were previously derived from rellich s compact embedding result , which , however , fails to hold even for simple non - smooth boundaries such as for example a unit cube @xmath380,1 \\right[}^{3}$ ] with a smaller cube @xmath39^{3}$ ] , @xmath400,1 \\right[}$ ] , removed .",
    "returning to our purpose here , we note that by following the intrinsic logic of the differential forms setting , a functional analytical framework for initial boundary value problems for maxwell s equations can be embedded in an extended first order system on riemannian manifolds , @xcite . considering the euclidean free space case",
    ", it turns out that this extension formally coincides with the ohmura system , @xcite .",
    "that alternating tensors can also be used to formulate quantum dynamics has been observed and proposed ( almost simultaneously to the publication of the celebrated dirac system ) by iwanenko and landau , @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the idea has not found the attention of the main stream at the time , which eventually led to the independent rediscovery of the possibility of reformulating quantum dynamics in 4-dimensional alternating differential forms by e. khler , @xcite .",
    "again , in its euclidean form , these equations turn out to coincide with the above extended maxwell system .",
    "it is again the clifford algebra setting in which the connection between the dirac equation and maxwell s equations has first been established , see e.g. @xcite .    despite of the possibility to discuss the interconnectedness of gem , the dirac equation and maxwell equations within the general framework of alternating differential forms on riemannian manifolds , as a matter of accessibility and simplicity we shall here focus on the euclidean case in open domains of @xmath41 .",
    "our main interest is to establish well - posedness results for related initial boundary value problems and to discuss the intimate connections between these systems and their impact on some applications .    in section [ sec : maxwells - system ] we shall start by establishing maxwell s equations in the framework of a functional analytical approach developed in @xcite .",
    "this approach hinges on the observation that the time - derivative can be established as a normal operator . in the present context",
    ", this observation allows for a transparent discussion of the extended maxwell system leading to new insights into this construction , see subsection [ sub : the - extended - maxwell ] . in the sections [ sec : gem ] and",
    "[ sec : the - dirac - system ] we establish the links to the gem and the dirac equation .",
    "the last section is dedicated to a particular coupled system of maxwell s equations for an electromagnetic field , the gem type system for the associated potentials and the dirac equation , which in the light of our observations turns into a coupled system of three extended maxwell systems .",
    "we recall from @xcite that the temporal differentiation operator denoted by @xmath8 can be established as a normal operator in the exponentially weighted complex @xmath42-type space @xmath43 given by @xmath44 where @xmath450,\\infty \\right[}$ ] .",
    "we endow this space with its natural inner product @xmath46 defined by @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes the inner product of the underlying complex hilbert space @xmath15 .",
    "if we consider @xmath49 as a real hilbert space with inner product @xmath50 then it turns out that @xmath8 is strictly positive definite and hence , continuously invertible .",
    "more precisely , we have @xmath51 moreover , we define the extrapolation space @xmath52 for @xmath53 associated with @xmath2 as the completion of @xmath54 with respect to the inner product @xmath55 in generalization of our earlier discussed material relations we obtain maxwell s equations in the form @xmath56 here , @xmath23 is defined as the closure of @xmath57 where @xmath58 is any open set , since boundary trace results and compact embedding results are not required for a basic well - posedness result . ] and @xmath59 denotes the set of infinitely differentiable functions with compact support in @xmath21 . the operator @xmath24 is then defined as its adjoint @xmath60 . as a consequence ,",
    "the operator @xmath61 is skew - selfadjoint .",
    "moreover , by the definition of @xmath23 an implicit boundary condition in ( [ eq : maxwell ] ) is prescribed for the unknown @xmath62 , namely the electric boundary condition @xmath63 , where @xmath64 denotes the outward unit normal vector field on @xmath65 ( indeed , the condition @xmath66 is a generalization of the electric boundary condition , since we can define the operator @xmath23 on domains , where no unit outward normal vector field exists ) .",
    "although any other boundary condition for @xmath67 producing  say  an m - accretive operator ( see @xcite for a characterisation of those boundary conditions ) , under the constraint on the coefficients discussed here , yield well - posedness , we focus here on the standard , skew - selfadjoint case , since our goal is to gain structural insights in connection with the extended maxwell system .",
    "the material law in ( [ eq : maxwell ] ) is given by @xmath68 where the operators @xmath69 and @xmath70 are arbitrary bounded linear operators on @xmath71 satisfying the two requirements    * [ ( h1)selfadjoint](*h1 * ) @xmath72 selfadjoint , * [ ( h2)-posdef](*h2 * ) @xmath73 for some @xmath740,\\infty \\right[}$ ] and all sufficiently large @xmath750,\\infty \\right[}$ ] .",
    "under these assumptions the operator @xmath76 together with its adjoint are both strictly positive definite obviously resulting in well - posedness of ( [ eq : maxwell ] ) , compare @xcite .",
    "moreover , the solution operator is _ causal _ , i.e. , denoting @xmath77 we have the operator equation @xmath78-\\infty,0[}(\\mathrm{m_0})s\\chi_{]-\\infty,0[}(\\mathrm{m_0})=\\chi_{]-\\infty,0[}(\\mathrm{m_0})s,\\ ] ] where @xmath79-\\infty,0[}(\\mathrm{m_0})$ ] denotes the multiplication operator on @xmath80 induced by the cut - off function @xmath81-\\infty,0[}(t)$ ] .",
    "@xmath82    a.   indeed , in @xcite the well - posedness is proved for a broader class of possible material laws @xmath7 , which are given as analytic operator - valued functions of @xmath83 .",
    "however , for sake of simplicity we restrict ourselves to the `` affine '' type situation ( [ eq : mat_law ] ) .",
    "b.   it is worth noting , that although in restricted cases well - posedness of maxwell s equations is a classical result , it is still a new result in the current generality , since here @xmath72 , @xmath84 are operators ( and not just matrices or matrix - valued functions with @xmath85-entries ) .",
    "so , in particular non - local coefficients are painlessly included .",
    "even if we consider only the matrix - valued case , the well - posedness result obtained is surprisingly powerful .",
    "we have * not * required @xmath72 to be strictly positive definite , but merely that ( * h1 * ) , ( * h2 * ) hold .",
    "thus , we have without additional effort not only included eddy current type problems , where @xmath86 with @xmath87 strictly positive definite , but indeed mixed problems , where @xmath72 is strictly positive definite in some part of @xmath21 and we have an eddy current type situation in another part of @xmath21 .",
    "a typical model situation for the latter case is the transmission problem between a transformer core with a gap and its complement , if within the transformer core an eddy current approximation is used , whereas in the complement the maxwell system with a strictly positive definite @xmath72 is assumed . with the usual methods ( semi - groups , symmetric hyperbolic systems , spectral theory etc . )",
    "such a model situation is not as easily accessible . c.   it is also noteworthy that we do not assume that @xmath88 are block - diagonal , as in the classical anisotropic inhomogeneous media case , so general bi - anisotropic and chiral media are covered by the same description .",
    "@xmath82    a.   with the help of the notion of sobolev lattices the equation @xmath89 may also be read line by line .",
    "the price one has to pay is that even if @xmath90 only the solution @xmath91 and @xmath92 belong to @xmath52 .",
    "but as we suppressed to write the closure for avoiding to clumsy a notation we observe that the constituents of the sum on the right - hand side only satisfy the following @xmath93 where we used the notion of sobolev lattices , see e.g.  @xcite ( and in particular @xcite ) .",
    "later , we shall need that @xmath91 in fact attains values in the domain of the maxwell operator if interpreted suitably .",
    "this can be made precise as follows . rearranging the terms in",
    ", we get that @xmath94 hence , from @xmath95 we infer that @xmath96 in particular , for @xmath97 belonging to the inductive limit @xmath98 , we get that @xmath99 . b.   if we want to include initial values in maxwell s equations @xmath100 we may assume that the given right hand side @xmath97 vanishes on @xmath38-\\infty,0 \\right]}$ ] and we additionally assume that , which gets differentiated with respect to time . ] @xmath101 for a given element @xmath102 .",

    "clearly , @xmath91 satisfies the differential equation ( [ eq : maxwell_abstract ] ) for positive times .",
    "moreover , due to the causality of the solution operator , we get that @xmath1050,\\infty \\right[}}}\\otimes u_{0}$ ] is supported on the positive real axis . furthermore , from we read off that @xmath1060,\\infty \\right[}}\\otimes u_0)\\in h_{\\nu,1}(\\mathbb{r};h_{-1}(a+1)),\\ ] ] where @xmath107 denotes the first extrapolation space associated with the operator @xmath108 ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "the extended maxwell system amounts to a specific coupling of acoustic equations with maxwell s equations , @xcite . to fix some notation , we introduce the following differential operators .",
    "let @xmath124 be an arbitrary open subset .",
    "we define the operator @xmath125 as the closure of @xmath126 likewise , we define @xmath127 as the closure of @xmath128 moreover , we set @xmath129 and @xmath130 and obtain @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",

    "moreover , since @xmath139 and @xmath140 commute , the operator @xmath141 is skew - selfadjoint as well .",
    "finally , using the well - known relations @xmath142 and @xmath143 , we derive @xmath144    with these skew - selfadjoint operators the extended maxwell system is given by    @xmath145    where @xmath146 is a bounded , selfadjoint and strictly positive definite operator on @xmath147 ( taking over the role of @xmath72 in the previous section ) .",

    "it is useful to consider this extended maxwell system e.g. for numerical purposes , see @xcite , or low frequency limits @xcite , since the spatial operator is now a differential operator of elliptic type , yielding a `` small '' ( e.g. a finite dimensional ) null space .",

    "the interpretation of this observation is not a mathematical issue but may well be a matter for theoretical physicists to contemplate . due to unitary equivalence of course nothing of the spinor structure is actually lost and may still be utilized if desired . since the extended maxwell system is actually a differential forms construction , as a by - product we get a natural transfer to riemannian manifolds other than @xmath41 for free , see remark [ rem : extended_maxwell ] ( d ) . as for the consideration of lower dimensional cases , we recall the discussion in remark [ rem : extended_maxwell ] ( d ) .",
    "the maxwell - dirac system ( @xcite ) is a coupled system of maxwell s equations and the dirac equation .",
    "the coupling occurs via the so - called vector and scalar potentials . in physics literature solutions to the dirac equation",
    "are also known as the spinors .",
    "having demonstrated the connections of the maxwell equation to the extended maxwell system as well as the connection of the dirac equation to the extended maxwell system , it remains to provide the relationship of the vector and scalar potentials to the extended maxwell system , which in effect leads to an extended maxwell system not for the electromagnetic field but for its potential : @xmath275 ] .",
    "this will actually play the major role in this section . for simplicity , we focus on the case , where the material parameters are of the form @xmath231 and @xmath276",
    ". we shall abbreviate @xmath277 on the open set @xmath58 .",
    "the relationship of the equations for the scalar and the vector potentials to the extended maxwell system is as follows :    [ thm : pot_solves_dirac ] let @xmath58 open and let @xmath278 satisfy maxwell s equation , i.e. , @xmath279 with the property that @xmath280 , @xmath281 $ ] , and @xmath282 such that @xmath283 on @xmath284-\\infty,0[$ ] .",
    "let @xmath285 , @xmath286 .",
    "then the following statements are equivalent :    a.   @xmath287 satisfies @xmath288 and @xmath289 , b.   @xmath290 , @xmath291 , and @xmath292 , @xmath293 satisfy @xmath2940,\\infty[}\\otimes \\alpha_{1,0})- { \\operatorname{grad}}\\alpha_0\\text { and } h= -{\\circ{{\\operatorname{curl}}}}\\alpha_1.\\ ] ]    let @xmath295 .",
    "assume that @xmath287 satisfies the extended maxwell system with right hand side @xmath296 .",
    "we have in @xmath111 @xmath2970,\\infty \\right[}}}\\otimes\\alpha_{1,0}\\right)-{\\circ{{\\operatorname{grad}}}}\\alpha_{0}+{\\operatorname{curl}}\\alpha_{2 } & = e,\\\\ \\partial_{0}\\alpha_{2}-{\\circ{{\\operatorname{curl}}}}\\alpha_{1}-{\\operatorname{grad}}\\alpha_{3 } & = h,\\\\ \\partial_{0}\\alpha_{3}-{\\circ{{\\operatorname{div}}}}\\alpha_{2 } & = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we consider the last two equations @xmath298 applying @xmath127 to the first and substituting @xmath299 from the second equation yields , still computing in the space @xmath111 , @xmath300 since @xmath15 satisfies the equation @xmath301 we obtain , using that @xmath302 $ ] , @xmath303}\\right)\\subseteq h_{{\\varrho},-\\infty}(\\mathbb{r};n({\\circ{{\\operatorname{div}}}})).\\ ] ] consequently , @xmath304 satisfies the wave equation with vanishing source term from which we derive @xmath291 .",
    "the latter gives @xmath305 consider now the second equation @xmath3060,\\infty \\right[}}}\\otimes\\alpha_{1,0}\\right)-{\\circ{{\\operatorname{grad}}}}\\alpha_{0}+{\\operatorname{curl}}\\alpha_{2}=e.\\label{eq : pot-2}\\ ] ] since @xmath307 satisfy maxwell s equations we have in particular @xmath308 as well as @xmath309 and so recalling that @xmath310 and applying @xmath23 to ( [ eq : pot-2 ] ) we get using one of the maxwell equations @xmath311 thus , @xmath312 by our assumption for the initial data @xmath313 .",
    "now , from the third equation we obtain that @xmath314 with ( [ eq : alpha12 - 1 ] ) we have that @xmath315 satisfies a maxwell system for vanishing data .",
    "thus , we have also @xmath316 and @xmath317 .",
    "since we have that @xmath318}$ ] , by ( [ eq : h_in_curl ] ) and the first equation of ( [ eq : alpha21 ] ) , and @xmath316 , we get @xmath319 , which shows the implication ( i ) @xmath320 ( ii ) .",
    "the converse implication is trivial .",
    "the tempted reader might wonder that for the potential @xmath287 being the unique solution of a partial differential equations , there is no room left for the issue of gauge invariance .",
    "this is , however , not the case .",
    "in fact , we observe that different potentials result in a different right - hand side of the partial differential equation under consideration .",
    "more precisely , we have @xmath321 for suitable scalar fields @xmath13 .",
    "now , we come back to the original maxwell - dirac system .",
    "as it has been demonstrated in the previous sections , the spinor part for the banded extended maxwell version ( i.e. the part of the dirac equation ) corresponds to the operator @xmath322 corresponds to the hamiltonian form of the extended maxwell system , while here we deal with the non - hamiltonian form ( [ eq : operator ] ) .",
    "] @xmath323 moreover , recall from theorem [ thm : pot_solves_dirac ] that under the constraint @xmath324 the potential @xmath287 is the solution of @xmath325 where @xmath326 is the solution @xmath327 of @xmath328 which requires the compatibility condition @xmath3290,\\infty \\right[}}}\\otimes{\\operatorname{div}}e_{0}. \\label{eq : compatible}\\ ] ] so the maxwell - dirac system is of the form @xmath330 where under assumptions ( [ eq : compatible ] ) , ( [ eq : pot - req-3 ] ) , @xmath91 is of the form @xmath331 .",
    "there is no apparent coupling in this system . in the actual maxwell - dirac system",
    "the coupling is via quadratic non - linearities built into the right - hand side @xmath332 .",
    "the real - valued eight - component @xmath333 corresponds to the four - component complex dirac state ( up to a ( real ) unitary mapping ) for which usually the same name is used .",
    "we have @xmath334 with @xmath84 as above ( @xmath84 is skew - selfadjoint ) .        in this case , ( on a purely formal level ) we need to have for real - valued data and solutions according to ( [ eq : compatible ] ) : @xmath341 formally calculating the right - hand side we get ( where we compute in the real setting , i.e. @xmath257 is the underlying scalar field ) @xmath342 so , assuming @xmath343 we have that the appropriate charge density coupling term matching the assumed quadratic non - linearity ( [ eq : md - req1 ] ) must be @xmath344 to ensure that the current density @xmath345 is suitable to generate an electro - magnetic field .",
