    "it is widely accepted that binary and multiple stars form as a result of fragmentation in collapsing molecular cloud cores ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in the last two decades , fragmentation of the molecular cloud core has been investigated through numerical simulations by many authors .",
    "criteria for the fragmentation of isothermally collapsing clouds has been investigated by @xcite .",
    "their criteria have converged as far as the isothermal phase is concerned ; a cloud with @xmath4 collapses into fragments depending little on @xmath5 , even when the initial density and velocity distributions differ . here ,",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath5 denote the ratio of thermal energy to gravitational energy and that of rotation energy to gravitational energy , respectively .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the criteria for fragmentation corresponds to the formation of a flat disk with flatness greater than @xmath7 . on the other hand ,",
    "a cloud with @xmath8 collapses self - similarly and shows no sign of fragmentation . @xcite and @xcite investigated deformation of the self - similarly collapsing cloud in search of the possibility that deformation of the central cloud to a bar might trigger fragmentation .",
    "the growth of the bar mode is slow compared to the timescale of the collapse , i.e. , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the amplitude of the bar mode and the maximum density of the cloud , respectively .",
    "the bar may indeed fragment , but only at a later stage .    as the collapse proceeds",
    ", the cloud core becomes optically thick and the efficiency of radiative cooling decreases .",
    "the temperature starts increasing when the central density exceeds the critical density of @xmath12 .",
    "this increase in temperature results in the formation of a quasi - static core , i.e. , the first core of @xcite .",
    "the first core grows by accreting gas , and this accretion phase persists for long enough for the core to fragment .",
    "thus , the dynamics of the cloud changes qualitatively at the critical density .",
    "stability against fragmentation is also likely to change at this critical density .",
    "in fact , the first core has been shown by recent simulations to be very unstable taking account of the change in temperature @xcite .",
    "their simulations , however , assume rather small @xmath13 .",
    "when @xmath13 is small , the cloud is jeans unstable and fragments easily @xcite .",
    "the fragmentation of the first core may be due to the small @xmath13 assumed .",
    "it is still unanswered whether the first core fragments when the initial cloud has a moderately large @xmath13 .",
    "thus , we investigate the fragmentation of the cloud with focus on the cloud with large @xmath6 of 0.765 .",
    "the initial cloud is only 1.1 times more massive than the critical bonnor - ebert sphere @xcite , which is an equilibrium state of the isothermal cloud .",
    "the bonnor - ebert sphere provides a good fit to the density distribution of a dark globule .",
    "according to recent near - infrared observations @xcite , the model with @xmath14 gives the best fit for b68 , where @xmath15 denotes the non - dimensional radius .",
    "similarly , those with @xmath16 and @xmath17 give a good fit for b335 @xcite and the coalsak @xcite , respectively .",
    "when @xmath18 , the bonnor - ebert sphere is unstable against collapse .",
    "thus , our initial model can be applied to these globules .",
    "the model can also be applied to cloud cores embedded with molecular clouds .",
    "the masses of such cores evaluated from c@xmath19o luminosity are similar to the virial masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this implies that the cores are gravitationally bound and nearly in equilibrium , and accordingly , the parameter @xmath6 is only slightly less than unity .",
    "recent numerical studies have lacked any survey of model parameters . in this study ,",
    "225 models with different rotation speed , rotation law , and amplitude of bar mode perturbation are considered .",
    "the simulations show many types of fragmentation , some of which are new .",
    "the main features of each type and the territory of each type in the parameter space are discussed .    in this paper",
    ", the collapse and fragmentation of molecular cloud cores is investigated using a nested grid .",
    "the nested grid has high spatial resolution near the center of the computation domain and allows fragmentation to be followed without violating the jeans condition @xcite . in  [",
    "sec : models ] , the models of cloud cores are introduced . in  [ sec : methods ] , the methods of numerical simulations are presented . in  [ results ] , the results are shown and the fragmentation is classified . in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , the origins of different types of fragmentation are discussed , the simulations are compared with earlier numerical works , the implications on binary formation are related .",
    "the paper is concluded in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "as a model for molecular cloud cores , we consider bonnor - ebert spheres , which belong to a sequence of equilibrium - state isothermal spherical clouds confined by external pressure @xcite . given the external pressure ( @xmath20 ) and the sound speed ( @xmath21 ) , the bonnor - ebert sphere is stable against collapse only when the central density is lower than the critical value , @xmath22 .",
    "the critical bonnor - ebert sphere is used as a template for the model clouds examined in this study . in the models ,",
    "the initial density distribution is given by @xmath23 and @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote the radius , density enhancement factor , the initial central density , and the gravitational constant , respectively .",
    "the function @xmath29 denotes the density distribution of the critical bonnor - ebert sphere , and can be approximated as @xmath30 the critical bonnor - ebert sphere has radius of @xmath31 .",
    "a density enhancement factor of @xmath32 is assumed in typical models because observed molecular clouds are nearly in the virial equilibrium .",
    "this slight density enhancement collapses rotating clouds when the initial cloud rotates slowly .    the initial central density is set at @xmath33 , which corresponds to a number density of @xmath34 for the assumed mean molecular weight of 2.3 .",
    "an initial temperature of @xmath35 is assumed , and hence @xmath36 . the radius and mass of the cloud",
    "are thus @xmath37 and @xmath38 for @xmath39 .",
    "the initial velocity includes only the @xmath40-component , and the angular velocity depends on @xmath41 and @xmath40 in cylindrical coordinates @xmath42 .",
    "the angular velocity @xmath43 is expressed as @xmath44 \\left [ 1 +   2 c \\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^2 \\right]^{-1/2 } \\ ; , \\label{eq : velocity}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 denotes the amplitude of the global rotation , and @xmath46 and @xmath47 denote the amplitudes of the velocity perturbation of @xmath48 and 3 .",
    "the parameter @xmath49 specifies the dependence of @xmath50 on @xmath51 . when @xmath52 , the angular velocity is independent of @xmath41 and rotation is `` rigid '' .",
    "when @xmath49 is larger , the angular velocity decreases more rapidly with increasing in @xmath41 .",
    "as shown later , fragmentation of the cloud core depends strongly on the parameter @xmath49 .",
    "a small amplitude for the perturbation of @xmath53 is set , such as @xmath54 , in all the models , where @xmath2 denotes the initial freefall timescale at the center and is defined as @xmath55 .",
    "this @xmath56 = 3 mode breaks the point symmetry with respect to @xmath41 = 0 , and accordingly the fragments are slightly asymmetric in this simulation . the model parameters @xmath1 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 are varied to investigate the effects of rotation speed , amplitude of the bar mode , and the rotation law on fragmentation of the cloud cores .    to compare our initial models with those of earlier simulations ,",
    "the ratios @xmath59 and @xmath60 are computed , where @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 are thermal energy , rotation energy , and gravitational energy , respectively ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    ". in our model , the initial cloud has @xmath64 .",
    "the parameter @xmath5 is independent of @xmath26 , and when @xmath65 , @xmath5 is described by @xmath66 where the coefficient @xmath67 is a function of @xmath58 as shown in figure [ c-beta-plot.eps ] .",
    "when a cloud rotates rigidly ( @xmath68 ) , it has @xmath69 .",
    "when @xmath70 , @xmath67 decreases approximately in proportion to @xmath71 .",
    "the decrease in @xmath67 is due to slow rotation in the outer part of the cloud .",
    "when @xmath13 and @xmath72 are small , the cloud is unstable against fragmentation .",

    "when the cloud is centrally peaked and the axis ratio is 1.5 , the criterion is @xmath74 for low @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "when the cloud is more oblate , i.e. , the axis ratio is 2.0 , the criterion is @xmath75 for low @xmath72 .",
    "this suggests that a cloud of @xmath76 is stable against fragmentation . in this study ,",
    "the possibility of fragmentation of a cloud with @xmath77 is examined .",
    "the dynamical evolution of a cloud is followed taking account of the self - gravity and gas pressure .",
    "the magnetic field is neglected for simplicity .",
    "the gas temperature is assumed to be 10  k below the critical density @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) , and to increase adiabatically in proportion to @xmath80 above it . in other words , a barotropic equation of state",
    "is assumed , as expressed by @xmath81 this change in temperature reproduces the formation of the adiabatic core , which corresponds to the first core of @xcite .",
    "the value of the critical density @xmath82 is taken from the numerical results of @xcite , who studied the spherical collapse of molecular cloud cores with radiative hydrodynamics .",
    "in the simulations , the hydrodynamical equation and poisson equation are solved by a finite difference method with second - order accuracy in time and space .",
    "a nested grid is employed to solve the central region with higher spatial resolution .",
    "the hydrodynamic code for the nested grid was developed by extending the simulation code of @xcite .",
    "the nested grid consists of concentric hierarchical rectangular grids @xcite , and the cell width of each grid decreases successively by a factor of two . in the following , the coarsest grid is labeled level @xmath83 = 1 .",
    "the @xmath83-th level grid has @xmath84 times higher spatial resolution than the coarsest grid .",
    "all the fluxes are conserved at the interface between the coarse and fine grids as in the standard adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the total mass is conserved in our computations .",
    "the numerical fluxes are obtained by the method of @xcite with modification to solve the isothermal and polytrope gas . a muscl approach and predictor - corrector method",
    "are adopted for time integration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the poisson equation is solved by a multigrid iteration on a nested gird @xcite .",
    "this code solves self - gravity consistently over all grids with different levels such that `` the gravitational field line '' is continuous at interfaces between coarse and fine grids .",
    "this consistency ensures that the obtained gravitational potential is accurate at least up to the quadrapole moment of a binary .",
    "thus , the gravitational torque induced by a binary is accurately taken into account in our simulation .    mirror symmetry with respect to the @xmath85 plane",
    "is employed to reduce computation cost .",
    "a fixed boundary condition is set for the surface of @xmath86 , representing a constant external pressure that confines the cloud during evolution .",
    "gas is considered only in @xmath87 when solving the poisson equation .    in this paper",
    ", each grid has @xmath88 cubic cells in high - resolution models , and @xmath89 cubic cells in low - resolution models in @xmath90 .",
    "the model parameters of the high - resolution models are shown in table [ table : model ] .",
    "the other models shown in this paper are the low - resolution models .",
    "the nested grid consists of grids of 5 levels at the initial stage .",
    "a new finer grid is introduced to maintain the jeans condition of @xmath91 with ample margin @xcite , where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the jeans length and cell width , respectively . whenever an eighth of the minimum jeans length ( @xmath94 ) became smaller than the cell width in the finest grid ,",
    "a new finer grid was added to the nested grid .",
    "this means that a finer grid was added with ample margin of factor 2 .",
    "typical models have 14 grid levels at the last stage .",
    "the jeans condition was only violated in these simulations when a high density fragment escaped from the region covered by the finest grid , and the computation was terminated in the stage that this occurred . in the model shown in  [ sec : disk ] , evolution was successfully computed up to the stage in which the mass of an adiabatic core ( total mass in the region of @xmath95 ) reached 0.07 @xmath96 .",
    "in this subsection , a total of 27 models of a rigidly rotating cloud ( @xmath68 ) in the region @xmath97 and @xmath98 are presented to study the dependence on @xmath1 and @xmath57 .",

    "the number of fragments and their orbital angular momentum then determines whether the fragments merge or survive . when the cloud fragments into three or more fragments , many of the fragments survive , as shown in _ ring - bar _ , _ satellite _ and _ ring _ types . on the other hand ,",
    "when the cloud fragments into only two fragments , the fate of the fragments depends on their orbital angular momenta : fragments with high orbital angular momentum survive ( e.g. , _ disk - bar _ type ) , while fragments with low orbital angular momentum merge ( e.g. , _ bar _ and _ dumbbell _ types ) . in the latter case , satellite fragments form after the merger .",
    "the orbital angular momentum of the fragment depends on the timing of deformation into the bar - shape .",
    "when the cloud deforms into a bar in the isothermal collapse phase , the bar does not have sufficient spin angular momentum to be supported by the rotation . in the isothermal collapse phase , the cloud undergoes runaway collapse and is never supported by the rotation @xcite .",
    "thus , the orbital motions of the fragments are also never supported by the rotation .",
    "furthermore , the bar loses angular momentum via gravitational torque in the accretion phase . in the model shown in ",
    "[ sec : dumbbell ] ( _ dumbbell _ type ) , each fragment has a specific orbital angular momentum of @xmath294 at the stage shown in figure [ be1.1c0.5_2.e-1_2.e-1_1.e-3.eps]_b_. this specific orbital angular momentum is only 20% of that required for support by rotation at @xmath295  au . on the other hand , when the cloud deforms into a bar in the accretion phase , the bar is supported by the rotation ( e.g. , _ disk - bar _ type ) .",
    "the adiabatic disk accretes gas with high specific angular momentum and is already supported by rotation prior to its fragmentation .",
    "_ bar _ and _ dumbbell _ type fragmentation were also seen in the numerical simulation of @xcite .",
    "they followed the evolution of clouds having an initial gaussian density profile by three types of approximations ; isothermal equation of state , barotropic equations of state , and the eddington approximation of radiative transfer .",
    "the barotropic model of @xcite exhibits _ bar _ type fragmentation .",
    "the density profiles shown in their figs .",
    "5_c _ and 5_d _ are similar to those shown in figures [ be1.1c0.15_2.e-1_2.e-1_1.e-3.eps]_b _ and [ be1.1c0.15_2.e-1_2.e-1_1.e-3.eps]_d _ here .",
    "using amr code , they followed the formation of a bar , fragmentation of the bar , and merger of the fragments .",
    "this evolution resembles that of the model shown in  [ sec : bar ] , although the initial condition is quite different .",
    "they terminated the calculation at the stage of adiabatic disk formation after the merger , and the stage of _ satellite _ type fragmentation was not shown .",
    "_ dumbbell _ type fragmentation is also seen in their fig .",
    "2_a _ , which is quite similar to figure [ be1.1c0.5_2.e-1_2.e-1_1.e-3.eps]_a _ here .",
    "_ dumbbell _ type fragmentation in their study was computed under the eddington approximation .",
    "the initial cloud of @xcite is defined by @xmath296 whereas @xmath297 in the present study .",
    "their cloud was thus colder , or in other words , more massive . despite this difference ,",
    "the fragmentation is very similar .",
    "the same mechanism of deformation and fragmentation therefore appears to be valid over a wide range of @xmath6 .",
    "_ satellite _ type fragmentation has also been seen in many other simulations @xcite .",
    "@xcite followed the fragmentation in the second collapse , in which the first core collapses to form the second core . in their simulations ,",
    "satellite fragments form through interaction of the spiral arms .",
    "the satellite fragments form in the same manner both in their and our simulations , even though different situations are considered .",
    "@xcite followed the collapse and fragmentation of molecular cloud cores similar to this paper .",
    "they also computed the formation of satellite fragments and followed their orbits using a nested grid .",
    "it was not explicitly mentioned whether the nested grid simulation satisfies the jeans condition . @xcite and @xcite confirmed the result by independent simulations using an sph code .",
    "some observations have indicated the rotation of molecular cloud cores .",
    "@xcite found that 29 of 43 molecular clouds had significant velocity gradient , corresponding to rigid rotation of @xmath298 with typical values of @xmath299 .",
    "these quantities correspond to @xmath300 with typical values of @xmath301 for models of @xmath302 .",
    "unfortunately , the observations were not of sufficient accuracy to specify the rotation law .",
    "our simulations show that collapsing clouds having an initial rotation of @xmath303 fragment , which is consistent with observed high binary frequency .",
    "molecular cloud cores have internal motion often interpreted as turbulence .",
    "the internal motion should reflect the superposition of various modes of velocity perturbations .",
    "when the bar mode of a cloud is a significant , the cloud undergoes _ satellite _ type fragmentation as shown in our simulations .",
    "therefore , _ satellite _ type fragmentation may be dominant .",
    "the satellite fragments merge and scatter while accreting gas .",
    "consequently , the satellites will have various binary separations .",
    "this may explain the wide range of separation for young and main sequence binaries ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it has recently been suggested that brown dwarfs may be formed by ejection of the seeds of stars from a parent cloud core @xcite .",
    "_ satellite _ type fragmentation might be a corresponding case .",
    "in many case of _ satellite _ type fragmentation , three or more fragments are formed . in these multiple systems , it is possible that a close encounter will eject the fragment from the cloud center .",
    "the satellite fragment has speed of @xmath304 at the last stage of the model of ( @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath58 ) = ( 0.2 , 0.2 , 0.15 ) ( for a fragment shown in the right side of figure [ be1.1c0.15_2.e-1_2.e-1_1.e-3.eps]_f _ ) . the velocity would be reduced substantially before ejection by the gravity of the molecular cloud core .",
    "the gravitational potential is evaluated to be @xmath305 , and the ejection speed would be @xmath306 . the ejected satellite fragment would have a velocity of the order of the escape speed if it exits .",
    "the collapse and fragmentation of molecular cloud cores was investigated for the case that the initial cloud is almost in equilibrium , focusing on the effects of rotation speed , rotation law , and bar mode perturbation .",
    "the main results are summarized as follows .",
    "a cloud 1.1 times denser than the critical bonnor - ebert sphere fragments when rotation of the initial cloud is slowly enough to allow collapse , but still significant , i.e. , @xmath307 .",
    "the latter condition gives rise to the formation of a flat disk in the isothermal collapse phase .",
    "this condition is independent of both the initial amplitude of the bar mode and the initial rotation law .",
    "six types of fragmentation were identified : _ disk - bar _ , _ ring - bar _ , _ satellite _ , _ bar _ , _ ring _ , and _ dumbbell _ types .",
    "the type of fragmentation depends on the initial amplitude of the bar mode and the initial rotation law .",
    "the fragments formed via _ bar _ or _ dumbbell _",
    "types fragmentation merge due to their low angular momenta , and new fragments form via _ satellite _ type fragmentation . in other words ,",
    "a cloud forms satellite fragments whenever the bar mode of the initial cloud is appreciable amplitude . merger and close encounter of the satellite fragments may result in the wide range of the binary separation .",
