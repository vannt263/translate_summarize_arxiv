    "ongoing optical surveys have discovered new classes of supernovae ( sne ) , including sub - luminous ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and super - luminous ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) events .",
    "many of these events are difficult to explain in the context of standard models for which radioactive decay powers the optical light curve ( e.g. , sn 2008es , * ? ? ?",
    "alternative explanations fall into two main categories .",
    "overluminous type  iin sne with narrow hydrogen absorption lines are thought to be powered , at least in part , by the interaction of the supernova ejecta with circumstellar material , effectively re - thermalizing the supernova shock energy @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the sn ejecta may be re - energized by the spindown power of a rapidly rotating magnetar which formed in the core collapse ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter kb10 ) . for either of these two mechanisms",
    "to significantly modify the sn light curve , the energy input must occur at relatively late times ( weeks to months ) when radiative diffusion through the ejecta is efficient .",
    "accretion onto a central compact remnant represents another potential means of injecting large amounts of energy in either successful or failed supernova explosions .",
    "compact object accretion is associated with large - scale outflows in neutron stars @xcite and stellar mass black holes ( microquasars , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and these outflows can carry away as much as @xmath3 of the gravitational binding energy of the infalling material .",
    "this is particularly true when the accretion flow is rotationally supported and radiatively inefficient @xcite .    in",
    " failed \" sne , the entire star accretes onto the central remnant , a black hole .",
    "if the progenitor lacks sufficient angular momentum to form a disk and hence tap the available accretion energy , these events are `` unnovae '' @xcite , i.e. , stars disappearing suddenly from view . in the opposite case where even the iron core becomes rotationally supported , the accretion energy may power a long - duration gamma ray burst ( grb ) ( the collapsar mechanism , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "much longer gamma ray transients may also be possible if either the mantle @xcite or the hydrogen envelope ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter qk12 ) becomes rotationally supported and drives a relativistic jet .",
    "the timescale associated with the energy injection corresponds roughly to the free - fall time of a stellar layer , about @xmath4  s for the iron core , but as long as @xmath5 yr for the hydrogen envelope of a red giant .",
    "powerful winds from the accretion disk may eventually provide sufficient energy to turn the failed sn into a successful one , exploding the remainder of the star @xcite .    in successful sne ,",
    "accretion from the `` fallback '' of the fraction of material remaing bound can be significant as well .",
    "the fallback may influence the resulting nucleosynthesis @xcite or delay the pulsar mechanism in a young proto - neutron star such as in sn 1987a @xcite .",
    "early time fallback may also provide a link between the explosion mechanism and the remnant mass distribution @xcite or alter the radiated neutrino spectrum @xcite .",
    "for red supergiant ( rsg ) progenitors with typical explosion energies ( @xmath6 ) , the fallback mass is relatively small ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "however , in more compact stars ( e.g. , blue supergiants , bsgs ) the formation of a strong reverse shock at the h / he interface can decelerate the ejecta and enhance the fallback mass to @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "for weak explosions , most of the star may fall back , with only a small fraction of the mass ejected in a dim sn @xcite .",
    "while the dynamics of supernova fallback have been studied in a various contexts , little has been said about how fallback may impact the optical sn light curve .",
    "the energy released from fallback accretion may profoundly affect what we observe , if two conditions are met .",
    "first , the accretion energy must be injected at relatively late times ( @xmath9 days ) otherwise it will be largely degraded by adiabatic expansion .",
    "such late time accretion may be possible for progenitors with extended envelopes , or for those where a reverse shock develops and gradually slows the inner layers of ejecta .",
    "second , the accretion energy must be thermalized within the sn ejecta .",
    "this is likely to occur if the energy injection takes the form of a nearly isotropic disk wind .",
    "if , on the other hand , the energy is in a beamed relativistic jet , we must consider whether the jet can breakout of the ejecta ( perhaps producing a grb ) or whether it is trapped and thermalized in the interior .",
    "when these two conditions are met , fallback should produce a peculiar optical light curve , powered directly by the accretion energy .",
    "we study the impact of late time fallback accretion of sn light curves , and suggest that the wide range of potential events  from sub luminous to super - luminous  may be of relevance in explaining recent observations of peculiar sne . in  [ accenergy ] , we crudely estimate the efficiency of fallback - accretion - driven outflows .",
    "we numerically calculate accretion rates for a wide range of stellar progenitors to explore the variety of outcomes for accretion powered supernova light curves (  [ outcomes ] ) , including sample light curves and their comparison to some recent unusual events (  [ sec : candidate - events ] ) .",
    "we also attempt to address the various requirements for these events to occur in nature : the interaction of the outflows with both the infalling material and the outgoing ejecta (  [ interactejecta ] ) , and angular momentum and disk formation (  [ angmom ] ) .",
    "the major results are summarized in  [ summary ] .",
    "at both low and high accretion rates compared to @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the eddington luminosity , accretion flows onto compact objects become hot and geometrically thick due to their inability to cool efficiently ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "such radiatively inefficient accretion flows are expected to produce large - scale outflows @xcite and/or poynting flux dominated jets @xcite .",
    "this behavior is observed in the accretion flow onto the galactic center black hole , sagittarius a * , where the accretion rate at the bondi radius ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is several orders of magnitude larger than that onto the black hole ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the fallback accretion rate following a successful supernova explosion is highly super - eddington and extremely optically thick to photons . for all timescales of interest here ( @xmath13s after the explosion ) ,",
    "the disk is not dense enough to cool by neutrino emission @xcite .",
    "we expect then that it should be radiatively inefficient , geometrically thick , and should drive large - scale outflows .",
    "the resulting mass outflow rate can be estimated following @xcite by assuming that the accretion rate increases as some power of radius @xmath14    where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the accretion rate and radius at the outer disk edge , and @xmath17 .",
    "we will write the radius in units of the schwarzchild radius , @xmath18 .",
    "the outflow speed should be comparable to the escape speed , @xmath19 , and the energy in each disk annulus is ,    @xmath20    where @xmath21 parameterizes our ignorance of the outflow physics , such as the fraction of fallback mass that is blown out again .",
    "the actual value of @xmath22 is highly uncertain , but @xmath23 is a reasonable choice ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in which case the total outflow rate integrated over disk radius is ,    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the inner disk edge , either the black hole event horizon or the surface of the proto neutron star . for typical parameters",
    "we take @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) and @xmath28 .",
    "these choices give an outflow energy @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "for the parameters considered here , other choices of @xmath31 give similar results .",
    "if the outflow is instead a jet launched from near the inner disk edge , the outflow energy is @xmath32 , where a conventional choice is @xmath33 , although depending on the accreted magnetic field geometry this value could be much larger @xcite .",
    "since @xmath34 , the resulting energy injection , @xmath35 would be nearly identical to the case of a disk wind .",
    "this is the scenario discussed for failed supernova explosions by @xcite and qk12 .",
    "the results presented below only depend on the energy injection rate and thus are the same for either a disk or a jet .",
    "the results are also expected to be insensitive to whether the central object is a proto neutron star or black hole . in  [ interactejecta ]",
    "we discuss the dissipation of accretion energy in the infalling material and outgoing ejecta , and its implications for the viability of wind and jet scenarios .",
    "we use @xmath36 throughout , although we discuss disk formation and size in  [ angmom ] . the outflow energy , either from a wind or jet ,",

    "explosions are simulated using a moving inner boundary (  piston , ",
    "e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for the first @xmath72s the boundary moves inwards from the location where the specific entropy @xmath98 to @xmath99 , after which time it moves outwards at constant velocity .",
    "the inner boundary velocity is set to zero either after a specified amount of time or after the internal energy has changed by the desired amount .",
    "the resulting explosions are fairly insensitive to the piston velocity as long as it is large enough to deposit the desired amount of energy in a few seconds .",
    "we use the same number of radial zones for the hydrodynamics calculations as were used for the stellar evolution ( @xmath100 ) , but verify that doubling the number of zones and interpolating using the nearest neighbor from the initial condition does not lead to significant changes in the evolution .",
    "an outflow boundary condition is employed by copying the acceleration from the outer zone to a single ghost zone .",
    "the inner boundary condition can be either a hard ( reflective ) piston or inflow , depending on the time .",
    "initially , the piston is used to blow up the star , after which the inner boundary velocity is set to zero . to allow inflow",
    ", once the velocity of the inner zone drops below zero , it is copied to the inner boundary .",
    "this allows us to use the inner boundary to blow up the star and to record the accretion rate once material begins to fall back .",
    "when the inner zone passes through the radius corresponding to the assumed outer disk edge , @xmath101 cm , its properties are saved and it is removed from the calculation . the outside of the accreted zone then becomes the inner boundary for the subsequent evolution .",
    "we show in figure [ pvd ] an example of the @xmath102 erg explosion of a @xmath103 , zero metallicity stellar progenitor . in this star , a significant density discontinuity at the helium / hydrogen interface ( @xmath104 cm ) as well as the compact hydrogen envelope ( @xmath105 ) lead to a strong reverse shock forming at @xmath106 s. the two - shock structure can be seen clearly in the curves of @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "the filled circles show the results using a pure piston inner boundary condition , while the solid lines show the results for the  fallback \" boundary condition ( i.e. , piston switched to inflow after the shock was initiated ) .",
    "the two are in excellent agreement in the portion of the star with @xmath109 , but differ slightly in the inner regions , as pressure support slows the infall in the pure piston model . in the fallback calculation , the reverse shock turns around and leads to a jump in the accretion rate at @xmath110 s. this calculation is very similar to that shown in figure 1 of @xcite , and the solutions are in qualitative agreement .",
    "the quantitative differences are likely due to a difference in progenitor models .",
    "we follow the explosions until late time ( @xmath111 s ) , and calculate the accretion rate through the inner boundary from the properties of accreted zones .",
    "sample accretion rate curves are shown in figure [ mdot ] . in some cases",
    ", we find large accretion rates @xmath112 for a week or so after the explosion .",
    "this late time accretion is due either to the fallback of stellar layers at large radii , or from the deceleration of inner layers by the reverse shock .",
    "the energy associated with accretion at these rates is sufficient to power luminous supernova light curves .",
    "the general behavior of the fallback accretion rate can be easily understood in the two limits where the material is either highly bound or mildly bound . for the highly bound material",
    "( i.e. , those layers where the velocity following the shock propagation is much less than the escape velocity ) the accretion rate can be estimated from the free - fall time ,    @xmath113    from each radial and mass coordinate in the progenitor star :    @xmath114    for an approximately power law density profile in a particular shell of a star , @xmath115 , the enclosed mass is @xmath116 ( for @xmath117 ) , and the fallback accretion rate is :    @xmath118    where @xmath119 ( cf .",

    "for @xmath120 , the enclosed mass is roughly constant , and the accretion rate is :    @xmath121    where now @xmath122 . in this way , the freefall accretion rate is set by the density profile of the progenitor star .    for the other limit of mildy bound material with @xmath123 ,",
    "the maximum radius , @xmath124 , becomes much larger than the initial one , @xmath125 .",
    "then the asymptotic fallback rate , @xmath1 , applies @xcite .",
    "this asymptotic scaling applies at the latest times in all three curves in figure [ mdot ] .    using the ballistics solution from @xcite , we can bridge these two asymptotic limits to analytically estimate the fallback accretion rate at all times for comparison with our numerical calculations . for each mass shell ,",
    "the downstream shock velocity is taken from the analytic formulae in @xcite , which are typically an excellent approximation to the numerical calculations .",
    "then the total fallback time for each mass element can be calculated from eq .",
    "3.7 of @xcite , and its time derivative is an approximate accretion rate .",
    "this assumes that pressure effects are negligible , which is incorrect .",
    "however , the true acceleration measured from the numerical calculations described below turns out to be roughly constant at half of the gravitational acceleration .",
    "this ballistic estimate reproduces the fallback accretion rate at all times in many progenitors .",

    "* ) the reverse shock formed at the hydrogen - helium interface is strong enough to decelerate portions of the ejecta below the escape speed .",
    "this enhances the accretion rate at late times , and can significantly add to the remnant mass @xcite .",

    ", we solve the strong shock jump conditions for the reverse shock velocity and the downstream velocity at the boundary of @xmath126 helium and hydrogen layers : @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the shock velocity .",
    "the reverse shock velocity evolves in time as the densities in both the expanding ejecta and unshocked hydrogen envelope change , and eventually it turns around . for simplicity",
    ", we ignore this and take @xmath129 to be constant at its initial value .",
    "then the location of intersection between ejecta and the reverse shock can be found , as well as the resulting ballistic @xmath130 for material that is recaptured after passing through the reverse shock .",
    "the reverse shock prescription is important for the z29 curve in figure [ mdot ] .",
    "this approximate semi - analytic description does a reasonable job reproducing the numerical calculations in all cases .",
    "the largest disagreement is in the reverse shock cases , where the semi - analytic accretion rate overestimates ( underestimates ) the numerical results at early ( late ) times . for the remainder of the paper",
    ", we use the results from the numerical fallback calculations .",
    "we detail here the possible outcomes of supernova light curves powered by accretion energy .",
    "we first assume that a supernova explodes via the traditional core collapse mechanism , whatever that may be . for each progenitor , we ran explosions with a variety of energies , in the range @xmath131 to @xmath132  ergs , in order to explore the full range of possible outcomes .",
    "only explosions with positive total energy of non - accreted material at @xmath133 are considered , and the resulting remnant vs. initial mass distribution from these explosions is in excellent agreement with @xcite .",
    "the ejection of some stellar layers and the fallback of others is then calculated numerically as described in ",
    "[ sec : numer - calc ] , which determines the energy input rate from fallback .",
    "we then calculate approximate one zone light curves using the methods described in appendix [ sec : light - curve - modeling ] . for these calculations , we need the effective diffusion time through homologously expanding ejecta @xcite ,    @xmath134    where @xmath135 is the total outflow mass , @xmath136 is the injected accretion energy , and @xmath137 is the final ejecta velocity .",
    "note that there is an ambiguity in determining @xmath138 , depending on the interpretation of the fudge factor @xmath21 .",
    "if @xmath21 indicates the fraction of outflow mass that interacts with the supernova ejecta , then the above expression for @xmath138 applies .",
    "if on the other hand , the mass transfer to the ejecta is more efficient while the specific energy of the outflow is lower , @xmath138 could be significantly larger .",
    "we assume a constant opacity @xmath139 , appropriate for electron scattering for fully ionized elements heavier than hydrogen .",
    "this is clearly a coarse approximation , as the actual opacity will depend on the composition and the presence of doppler broadened lines .",
    "the effects of recombination on the opacity are , however , included in an approximate way ( appendix [ sec : light - curve - modeling ] ) .",
    "while our one zone light curve models account for the acceleration of the ejecta due to the input accretion energy , they lack any information on the radial structure of the ejecta .",
    "the radiation hydrodynamical calculations of kb10 show that energy deposition at the base of the ejecta ( in that case from a magnetar ) blows a bubble in the inner regions , piling up material into a dense shell .",
    "we expect a similar effect in fallback powered sne , which will likely also induce an asymmetry if the energy deposition is anisotropic .    for each of the light curves ,",
    "we measure the time to peak , @xmath140 , and the peak luminosity , @xmath141 .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ lptpl ] for @xmath36 .",
    "each point represents a single explosion energy and progenitor model , color - coded by the radius of the pre - supernova star : red for @xmath142 ( rsgs ) , purple for @xmath143 , blue for @xmath144 ( bsgs ) , and green for @xmath145 ( he or c / o stars ) .",
    "this radius also corresponds to the zero age main sequence metallicity : solar without significant mass loss for rsgs , zero for bsgs , @xmath93 for stars in between , and solar with large amounts of mass loss for compact he and c / o stars .",
    "events are only plotted if @xmath141 is larger than the thermal supernova luminosity ,    @xmath146    the number of points is then set by the number of explosion energies and progenitor models , as well as the fraction of cases where that condition is met . the number of points does not represent an expected rate , since both the choices of explosion energies and progenitor models are arbitrary .",
    "figure [ lptpl ] illustrates the wide range of light curves that may result when fallback power is included .",
    "many of the successful explosions with energies @xmath147 lead to events with @xmath148 days , @xmath149 .",
    "the long durations are similar to those of type  ii plateau sne , and a result of the large ejecta masses and correspondingly long diffusion times .",
    "the final velocities of these events are also fairly typical of core - collapse supernova explosions ( @xmath150 ) .",
    "this is because the amount of fallback is much less than the ejecta mass , so that fallback energy does not appreciably change the total kinetic energy of the explosion . for smaller ejecta masses ,",
    "the fallback energy can dominate the total explosion energy , significantly increasing the final velocity .",
    "the diffusion timescale therefore decreases with decreasing ejecta mass both from the smaller total mass and because of the increasing final ejecta velocity .",
    "these effects lead to a strong scaling of @xmath141 with @xmath47 , shown in figure [ tpvf ] .",
    "the roughly @xmath151 dependence can be recovered by assuming the fallback energy always dominates the supernova energy ( @xmath152 ) , while the fallback mass contributes negligibly to the ejecta mass .",
    "furthermore , the scaling assumes that the total fallback energy scales with peak luminosity ( @xmath153 ) , which is true if the accretion rate at late times scales with its integral over all times .",
    "the apparent maximum in @xmath154 is from the case where the fallback mass and energy dominate that of the supernova explosion : @xmath155 for our standard parameters . in the context of the simple outflow models described in section [ accenergy ] , this maximum velocity scales as @xmath156 .",
    "the considerable scatter in figure [ tpvf ] is from the breakdown of the above assumptions .",
    "different classes of progenitor stars lead to different outcomes in figure [ lptpl ] .",
    "first , solar metallicity rsg progenitors for the most part lead to relatively low luminosity events ( @xmath157 ) . at high zams masses ,",

    "these progenitors can lead to events with @xmath158 , @xmath159 .",
    "these could potentially explain broad line type ibc grb sne : high velocities are a natural outcome of the injection of large amounts of fallback energy .",
    "example fits are shown in figure [ events ] for sn 1998bw @xcite and sn 2008d @xcite . in the context of the collapsar model",
    ", this suggests that the central engine could be responsible for all of the observed properties : early time accretion leading to black hole formation , the grb , and the initial supernova explosion ; and late time accretion powering the resulting light curve and the large expansion velocities .",

    ", they can produce luminosities @xmath160 and peak times of @xmath161 days .",
    "the short durations are from the very small ejecta masses , @xmath162 , with nearly all of the star falling back . for @xmath163",
    "used here , the wind mass is comparable to the ejecta mass , and the injected fallback energy is much larger than the initial explosion energy .",
    "this leads to large final velocities and short diffusion times .",
    "events with @xmath164 days can have light curve shapes very similar to observed luminous type ii - l events .",
    "an example fit to the superluminous type ii - l sn 2008es @xcite is shown in figure [ events ] .    at high explosion energies ,",
    "bsg progenitors lead to a range of long duration events with @xmath165 days , @xmath166 .",

    "following qk12 , we assume a magnetically - dominated outflow , collimated with an opening angle @xmath176 .",

    "conversely , for the outflow energy to be deposited efficiently in the ejecta the outflow escape time should be shorter than the energy deposition time .",

    "the result is :    @xmath202    the requirements i ) @xmath203 , ii ) @xmath204 , and iii ) @xmath205 amount to constraints on the outflow opening angle , @xmath176 , and the time over which fallback accretion can continue .",

    "the timescale constraints essentially place limits on @xmath176 for each type of outflow for all disk formation times , @xmath181 : at small ( large ) opening angles , the outflow escapes ( is captured ) .",
    "these ratios also depend on the other quantities , leading to differences between various models .",

    "outflows trapped in the material still falling back would likely deposit energy there more effectively , either unbinding the material or prolonging its accretion to later times .    at late times , the outflow will unbind any remaining material , shutting off further accretion .",
    "this is because the energy deposition into the accreting material at late times scales as @xmath210 , while its binding energy scales as @xmath211 .",
    "equating these gives the turn off time ( @xmath182 ) for each event .",
    "this turn off time tends to be shorter in higher energy explosions , since the bulk of the late time accretion comes from loosely bound material .",
    "sample light curves for events where accretion shuts off are shown in figure [ lcurveonoff ] for a range of @xmath182 , assuming a constant opacity .",
    "once the injected energy runs out , the light curve decays according to eq .",

    "this may be particularly relevant for long duration transients in models like u60 and z29 , where the turn off time ( @xmath213 days for z29 ) is likely to be comparable to the time to peak .",
    "although these estimates demonstrate the plausibility of accretion - driven outflows powering supernova light curves , detailed physical calculations will be required to assess this scenario accurately .",
    "further , the statement that the outflow can not escape the ejecta does not provide an efficient means of thermalization , since we have assumed @xmath214 .",
    "using a larger value of @xmath215 would shift the range of allowed opening angles to favor relativistic jets , and lead to the outflow unbinding the accreting the material time at proportionally earlier times .",
    "the efficiency of thermalization depends on how exactly energy is transported from the accretion disk to the supernova ejecta .",
    "we have assumed that this mechanism is a highly magnetized disk wind or an ultra - relativistic jet .",
    "if instead the wind is not highly magnetized , a double ( forward / reverse ) shock structure will form when it catches up with the slowly moving inner layers of the supernova ejecta ( kb10 ) .",
    "the situation is analogous to the commonly case of supernovae interacting with circumstellar material , only here the interaction happens inside , rather than outside the remnant . in either case , shocks should be efficient in thermalizing the kinetic energy of the wind .",
    "some recent semi - analytic @xcite and numerical @xcite calculations of non - radiative accretion flows have found large - scale circulations or convective motions @xcite as well as or instead of outflows .",
    "this may also be a relevant mechanism for transporting accretion energy to large radius .",
    "if the accretion energy can not efficiently thermalize , it will likely still lead to high ejecta velocities @xmath216 . in the case of an event like s33",
    ", this could still explain broad line type ibc supernovae : radioactivity would power the light curve and accretion energy would lead to the high observed photospheric velocities .",
    "this is also a possible outcome of early time accretion onto a magnetar @xcite .",
    "given the viable range of disk formation times for fallback accretion powered supernovae [ interactejecta ] and the initial stellar radii accreting at those times , we can calculate the required angular velocity .",
    "curves for models z29 , u45 , and s33 are shown in figure [ vstar ] for forming disks at radii from @xmath217 , or @xmath218 for a @xmath219 black hole . naively assuming rigid rotation , in all cases disks can form at the required times without exceeding breakup at the outer edge of the star .",
    "the required rotation rates essentially scale with explosion energy : for large explosion energies , the envelope is expelled , and larger rotation rates are required for the disk to form from material that was originally at smaller radius .    under this assumption , we can also calculate the maximum disk size from fallback accretion , and the corresponding viscous time , @xmath220 , where @xmath221 is the accretion flow scale height and @xmath222 is the standard dimensionless viscosity parameter in accretion theory @xcite .",
    "even with conservative assumptions ( @xmath223 , @xmath224 ) , this timescale only becomes larger than the fallback timescale for the highest rotation rates and early disk formation times @xmath225s .",
    "this is because assuming rigid rotation , the total disk size never greatly exceeds its formation radius .",
    "stellar cores spin up as they contract , and depending on the efficiency of angular momentum transfer from magnetic torques @xcite can transfer much of the core angular momentum to the outer layers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if this mass is retained , as in our models from low metallicity progenitors ( e.g. , z29 and u45 ) , it will likely form a disk upon fallback for modest zams rotation rates .",
    "if instead this mass is lost ( e.g. , s33 ) , insufficient angular momentum may remain to form a disk .",
    "if the red supergiant is in a binary system , tidal interactions may be an efficient means to spin up the star sufficiently to cause disk formation even if the envelope is lost during subsequent evolution @xcite .",
    "the latter scenario may be fairly common , given the frequency of massive stars in binaries @xcite .",
    "these scenarios should be considered in more detail in future work .",
    "the accretion power released when material falls back onto a compact remnant at late times could power unusual supernova light curves .",
    "we have explored the consequences for a variety of progenitors and explosion energies , using numerical calculations of the fallback accretion rate and order of magnitude estimates of the resulting energy injection .",
    "while most of the fallback typically occurs at early times , it may be significant at late times in very massive stars , for low explosion energies , or when a strong reverse shock forms at the hydrogen / helium boundary .",
    "we have demonstrated that it is plausible that , under certain circumstances , the energy available from accretion could power an outflow which then thermalizes in the supernova ejecta .",
    "the events we have described are different and more diverse than what have previously been studied as `` fallback supernovae '' .",
    "@xcite , for example , considered the case of massive star collapse in which most of the material fell into the central black hole and only a fraction was ejected . because they also assumed that the surrounding medium was very dense and extended ( due to mass loss prior to explosion ) the supernova shock wave did not breakout of the circumstellar gas until late times .",
    "the result was a dim , shock - powered transient lasting from weeks to months .",
    "@xcite similarly considered the case in which most of the star fell back and only a very small amount ( @xmath226 ) was ejected . by assuming that this ejecta was enriched with @xmath227ni",
    ", they found a brief and sub - luminous radioactively powered transient similar to sn  2005e .",
    "both of these previous scenarios neglected the possible input of accretion energy from fallback ( i.e. , they assumed @xmath228 ) . as we have shown , accretion may re - energize the ejecta at late times and hence power much brighter emission",
    ".    the power from fallback accretion may be relevant for explaining recently discovered classes of peculiar supernovae .",
    "these may include the type  iil supernovae that are extremely luminous and of relatively short duration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as those that are moderately bright and of very long duration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "several of the observed type  ii events , however , also show narrow hydrogen emission features in their spectra , indicating that interaction with a dense circumstellar medium is occurring and may be responsible for the luminosity .",
    "many of the predicted type ii events with @xmath229 erg explosion energies have very long times to peak ( @xmath230 days ) .",
    "accretion energy is likely to unbind the remaining infalling material on a comparable timescale , turning off the power source for the light curve (  [ interactejecta ] ) .",
    "we therefore predict that these events could be seen as very bright type ii supernovae that disappear suddenly from view . in general",
    ", late time turn off would be an observational signature of fallback accretion powered supernovae .",
    "fallback accretion could also power very bright type  i events .",
    "the models considered in this paper reached peak luminosities of @xmath231 , similar to the broad - lined sne  ic like sn  1998bw . if the accretion efficiency is assumed to be higher than our fiducial case , it is possible for some events to reach luminosities @xmath232 , in which case fallback could power the super - luminous hydrogen poor events such as sn  2005ap @xcite .",
    "another effect that may produce super - luminous events like sn  2005ap involves mass loss .",
    "some events considered here ( e.g. , z29 ) are brightened considerably by enhanced accretion from material decelerated by a reverse shock forming at the h / he interface .",
    "a similar outcome could occur in both type i / ii events where the progenitor has experienced considerable mass loss shortly before explosion . in this case , the reverse shock would be formed when the outgoing shock wave reaches the interface between the progenitor star and the massive wind or ejected shell .",
    "the subsequent inward propagation of the reverse shock could lead to order of magnitude increases in the fallback accretion rate at later times .",
    "interaction of supernova ejecta with circumstellar shells at radii @xmath233  cm is commonly considered to explain superluminous supernovae via thermalization of the kinetic energy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "surprisingly , interaction with circumstellar material at much smaller radii ( @xmath234  cm ) may also lead to an super - luminous event , but by very different means  by enhancing fallback accretion and feeding the central compact object at late times .    also of potential relevance to the fallback scenario",
    "are dimmer supernovae that decline very rapidly after peak .",
    "the short duration of these events makes it difficult to explain them as radioactively powered transients . in the case of sn  2002bj at least , the mass of @xmath227ni inferred from the light curve peak exceeds the total ejecta mass inferred from the light curve duration ( diffusion time ) , seemingly ruling out a radioactively powered events . in the fallback scenario ,",
    "short lived transients are possible , especially if the energy injection from accretion cuts off the fallback abruptly ( figure  [ lcurveonoff ] ) .",
    "the true range of possible light curves powered by fallback accretion is likely much larger than shown in figure [ lptpl ] .",
    "those events are limited in both the variety of progenitor models and by our neglect of the fallback accretion physics .",
    "the latter could conceivably lead to variations in @xmath175 in either direction : smaller disks and/or more efficient thermalization of the outflow could lead to higher peak luminosities @xmath235 .",
    "conversely , lower efficiencies could help explain a wider variety of sub - luminous supernovae ( e.g. , sn 2008 ha , * ? ? ?",
    "further modeling is needed to identify the observational signatures of fallback accretion powered supernovae , and determine how we might distinguish these events from other means of generating unusual light curves .",
    "possible signatures include a tail with @xmath236 at late times compared to the diffusion time ( but before the ejecta become completely optically thin ) , somewhat different from those from radioactivity or magnetar spindown .",
    "more promisingly , at late times ( @xmath237 days ) it seems likely that the accretion energy will unbind the infalling material (   [ interactejecta ] ) , shutting off accretion and leading to a sudden decrease in luminosity .",
    "if instead accretion continues for decades after the explosion , the black hole could emerge as an observable x - ray source @xcite , as has been suggested for sn 1979c @xcite .    the conditions for fallback to influence the supernova light curve are apparently quite special , as the scenario requires sufficient angular momentum to form a disk and an evolution that permits fallback to persist long enough to drive energetic outflows at late times .",
    "such a confluence of factors may be rare in the universe .",
    "on the other hand , observational surveys show that the rate of peculiar sne  in particular the rate of very luminous ones  is only a small fraction that of standard core collapse events .",
    "it is possible that fallback power plays a role in some of these spectacular events .",
