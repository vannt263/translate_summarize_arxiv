    "the reflexive game theory ( rgt ) has been entirely developed by lefebvre @xcite and is based on the principles of _ anti - selfishness or egoism forbiddeness _ @xcite and human _ reflexion processes _ @xcite . therefore rgt is based on the human - like decision - making processes .",
    "the main goal of the theory is to model behavior of individuals in the groups .",
    "it is possible to predict choices , which are likely to be made by each individual in the group , and influence each individual s decision - making due to make this individual to make a certain choice . in particular ,",
    "the rgt can be used to predict terrorists behavior @xcite .    in general ,",
    "the rgt is a simple tool to predict behavoir of invididuals and influence individuals choices .",
    "therefore it makes possible to control the individuals in the groups by guiding their behavoir ( decision - making , choices ) by means of the corresponding influences .    on the other hand ,",
    "now days robots have become an essential part of our life .",
    "one of the purposes robots serve to is to substitute human beings in dangerous situations and environments , like defuse a bomb or radioactive zones etc .",
    "in contrast , human nature shows strong inclinations towards the risky behavior , which can cause not only injuries , but even threaten the human life .",
    "the list of these reasons includes a wide range starting from irresponsible kids behavior to necessity to find solution in a critical situation .",
    "in such a situation , a robot should full - fill a function of refraining humans from doing risky actions and perform the risky action itself , if needed .",
    "however , robots are forbidden and should not physically force people , but must convince people on the mental level to refrain from doing a risky action .",
    "this method is more effective rather than a simple physical compulsion , because humans make the decisions ( choices ) themselves and treat these decisions as their own .",
    "such technique is called a _ reflexive control _",
    "@xcite .",
    "the task of finding appropriate reflexive control is closely related with the inverse task , when we need to find suitable influence of one subject on another one or on a group of subject on the subject of interest .",
    "therefore , it is needed to develop the framework of how to solve the inverse task .",
    "this is the primary goal of this study .",
    "however , for better understanding of the gist of the inverse task and its intrinsic relationships with other issues of the rgt , we introduce the entire spectrum of the tasks , which can be solved by the rgt .",
    "this forms the scope of inference algorithms used in the rgt .",
    "we present the rgt algorithms in the form of the _ schemas of control systems _ that can be instantly applied for developement of soft- or / and hardware solutions .",
    "we develop a hierarchy of control systems for abstract individual ( including human subject ) and robotic agent ( robot ) based on these control schemas .",
    "finally , we illustrate application of the inverse task together with other rgt inference algorithms to model robot s behavior in the mixed groups of humans and robots .",
    "the rgt deals with groups of abstract subjects ( individuals , humans , autonomous agents etc ) .",
    "each subject is assigned a unique variable ( _ subject variable _ ) .",
    "any group of subjects is represented in the shape of _ fully connected graph _ , which is called a _",
    "relationship graph_. each vertex of the graph corresponds to a single subject .",
    "therefore the number of vertices of the graph is in one - to - one correspondence with overall number of subjects in the groups .",
    "each vertex is named after the corresponding subject variable .",
    "the rgt uses the set theory and the boolean algebra as the basis for calculus .",
    "therefore the values of subject variables are elements of boolean algebra .",
    "all the subjects in the group can have either alliance or conflict relationship .",
    "the relationships are identified as a result of group macroanalysis .",
    "it is suggested that the installed relationships can be changed .",
    "the relationships are illustrated with graph ribs .",
    "the solid - line ribs correspond to alliance , while dashed ones are considered as conflict . for mathematical analysis alliance",
    "is considered to be conjunction ( multiplication ) operation ( @xmath0 ) , and conflict is defined as disjunction ( summation ) operation ( + ) .    the graph presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]a or any graph containing any sub - graph isomorphic to this graph are not decomposable . in this case , the subjects are excluded from the group one by one , until the graph becomes decomposable .",
    "the exclusion is done according to the importance of the other subjects for a particular one @xcite .",
    "any other fully connected graphs are decomposable . any decomposable graph can be presented in an analytical form of a corresponding _",
    "polynomial_. any relationship graph of three subjects is decomposable ( see @xcite ) .",
    "consider three subjects @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "let subject @xmath3 is in alliance with other subjects , while subjects @xmath4 and @xmath2 are in conflict ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]b ) .",
    "the polynomial corresponding to this graph is @xmath5 .        , [ b]$ ] and @xmath6 $ ] are elementary polynomials.,height=75 ]    regarding a certain relationship , the polynomial can be stratified ( decomposed ) into _ sub - polynomials _",
    "each sub - polynomial belongs to a particular level of stratification .",
    "if the stratification regarding alliance was first built , then the stratification regarding the conflict is implemented on the next step .",
    "the stratification procedure finalizes , when the _ elementary polynomials _ , containing a single variable , are obtained after a certain stratification step .",
    "the result of stratification is the _ polynomial stratification tree ( pst)_. it has been proved that each non - elementary polynomial can be stratified in an unique way , i.e. , each non - elementary polynomial has only one corresponding pst ( see @xcite considering one - to - one correspondence between graphs and polynomials ) .",
    "each higher level of the tree contains polynomials simpler than the ones on the lower level . for the purpose of stratification",
    "the polynomials are written in square brackets .",
    "the pst for @xmath5 polynomial is presented in fig.[fig : fig2 ] .",
    "next , we omit the branches of the pst and from each non - elementary polynomial write in top right corner its sub - polynomials . the resulting tree - like structure is called a _ _ diagonal form__@xcite .",
    "consider the diagonal form corresponding to the pst in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] : @xmath7 + [ c ] }   \\\\     { } & { [ a][b + c ] } & { }   \\\\     { [ a(b + c ) ] } & { } & { \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; . }   \\\\ \\end{array}\\ ] ]    hereafter , the diagonal form is considered as a function defined on the set of all subsets of the _",
    "universal set_. the universal set contains the _",
    "elementary actions_. for example , these actions are actions @xmath8 and @xmath9 . by definition ,",
    "boolean algebra _ of the universal set includes four elements : @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and the empty set 0 = @xmath13 .",
    "these elements are all the possible subsets of universal set and considered as alternatives that each subject can choose .",
    "the alternative @xmath14 is interpreted as an inactive or idle state . in general , boolean algebra consists of @xmath15 alternatives , if universal set contains @xmath16 actions .",
    "accroding to definition given by lefebvre @xcite , we present here exponential operation defined by formula @xmath17    where @xmath18 stands for negation of @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "this exponential operation is used to fold the diagonal form . during the folding , round and square brackets",
    "are considered to be interchangeable .",
    "the following equalities are also considered to be true : @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",

    "each level is considered as an images .",
    "the root of the tree is the input into the cognitive system and , therefore can be considered as the image of the world ( environment including self and others ) , perceived by the subject .",
    "as it follows from the pst , there is a hierarchy of images , corresponding to a particular cognitive level . during processing along this hierarchy in the _ bottom - up _ manner , the image on the lower level undergoes an extensive process of simplification by the means of decomposition into simpler parts on the higher level .",
    "these parts are considered to be the images of the image on the previous level .",
    "therefore , the images on the second level are different representions of the original image of the world .",
    "this procedure repeats until we obtain elementary part ( elementary polynomials ) @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the pst folding procedure can be referred as _ top - down _ intergration process of simpler images from the higher levels .",
    "therefore , the stratification procedure of original polynomial together with the folding procedure of the diagonal form illustrate the interplay of _ bottom - up _ and _ top - down _ information processes , which are widely imployed in biological @xcite and artificial @xcite information processing systems .",
    "the idea of hierarchical structure is highly coherent with hierarchical organization of majority of natural ( inanimate objects ) and biological ( living creatures ) entities .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that hierarchical structure is intrinsic for the relationships in societies of insects @xcite , animals @xcite and human beings .",
    "therefore hierarchical representation of the groups in the form of pst correspond to extraction of the hierarchical structure of the given group , while fusion of the pst and its diagonal form with diagonal form folding procedure closely resembles the way of information processing within a single independent congnitive system as discussed above .",
    "thus , rgt imploys the fundamental principles of hierarchical organization on both group ( reflects structure of the groups ) and individual ( illustrates information processing within independent cognitive system of a single unit ) levels .",
    "this makes rgt universal tools that mildly bridges the gap between representation and analysis .",
    "the goal of each subject in a group is to choose an alternative from the set of alternatives under consideration . to obtain choice of each subject , we consider the _ decision equations _ , which contain subject variable in the left - hand side and the result of diagonal form folding in the right - hand side : @xmath23 to find solution of the decision equations , we consider the following equation : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the subject variable , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are some sets . eq.([canfrom ] ) represents _ the canonical form of decision equation_. this equation has solution if and only if the set @xmath27 is contained in set @xmath26 : @xmath28 .",
    "if this requirement is satisfied , then eq.([canfrom ] ) has at least one solution from the interval @xmath29 @xcite . otherwise , the decision equation has no solution , and it is considered that subject can not make a decision .",
    "in such situation , the subject is in frustration state .    therefore , to find solutions of decision equation , one should first transform it into the _",
    "canonical form_. out of three presented equations only the decision equation for subject @xmath3 is in the canonical form , while other two should be transformed .",
    "we consider explicit transformation only of decision equation for subject @xmath4 @xcite : +   + @xmath30 .",
    "+ therefore , @xmath31    the transformation of equation for subject @xmath2 be can be easily derived by analogy : @xmath32 .",
    "next we consider two tasks , which can be formulated regarding the decision equation in the canonical form and provide methods to solve each task .",
    "the variable in the left - hand side of the decision equation in canonical form is the variable of the equation , while other variables are considered as influences on the subject from the other subjects .",
    "the _ forward task _ is formulated as a task to find the possible choices of a subject of interest , when the influences on him from other subjects are given .",
    "after transformation of arbitral decision equation into its canonical form , the sets @xmath26 and @xmath27 are functions of other subjects influences .",
    "for example , if we consider group of subjects @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath2 , etc .",
    "togehter with the abstract representation of decision equation in canonical form for subject @xmath3 , the sets @xmath26 and @xmath27 will be the functions of subject variables @xmath4 , @xmath2 , etc . : @xmath33    in the case of only three subjects @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath2 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "all the influences are presented in influence matrix ( table [ infmat ] ) .",
    "the main diagonal of influence matrix contains the subject variables .",
    "the rows of the matrix represent influences of the given subject on other subjects , while columns represent the influences of other subjects on the given one .",

    "equation for subject @xmath3 does not have any solutions , since set @xmath40 is contained in set @xmath41 : @xmath42 . thus ,",
    "subject @xmath3 can not make any decision .",
    "therefore he is considered to be in frustration state .",
    "equation for subject @xmath4 has at least one solution , since @xmath43 .",
    "the solution belongs to the interval @xmath44 .",
    "therefore subject @xmath4 can choose any alternative from boolean algebra , which contains alternative @xmath12 .",
    "these alternatives are @xmath45 and @xmath12 .",
    "equation for subject @xmath2 turns into equality @xmath46 .",
    "this is possible only in the case , when @xmath47 . here",
    "@xmath48 .",
    "in contrast to the forward task , the _ inverse task _ is formulated as a task to find all the simultaneous ( or joint ) influences of all the subjects together on the subject of interest that result in choice of a particular alternative or subset of alternatives .",
    "we call the subject of interest to be a _ controlled subject_.    let subject @xmath3 be a controlled subject and @xmath49 is a fixed value , representing an alternative or subset of alternatives , which subjects @xmath4 , @xmath2 , etc",
    ". want subject @xmath3 to choose .",
    "we call value @xmath49 to be a _ target choice_. by substituting subject variable @xmath3 with fixed value @xmath49 , we obtain the _ influence equation_. if we substitute the subject variable @xmath3 with fixed value @xmath49 in the canonical form of the decision equation ( eq .",
    "( [ ftcnf ] ) ) , we obtain _ the canonical form of the influence equation _ : @xmath50    for only three subjects @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath2 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "in contrast to the decision equation , which is equation of a single variable , the influence equation is the equation of multiple variables . however , the number of variables of influence equation is not trivial question .",
    "in fact , the number of variables in influence equation can be less then @xmath51 , where @xmath16 is the total number of subjects in the group .",
    "there are groups , in which sets @xmath26 and @xmath27 are functions of less than @xmath51 variables ( see appendix [ appen1 ] ) .",
    "therefore the variables that present in influence equation are called _ effective variables_.    the inverse task is by definition itself only guaratee that the original decision equation @xmath52 turns into true equality , but it is not guaranteed that these solutions are the only ones that turn decision equation into true equality . ] formalized as to find all the joint solutions of all subjects in the group , except for the controlled one , when the target choice is represented by interval @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are some sets and @xmath56 .",
    "in such a case , to solve the inverse task , one should solve the system of influence equations :    align a(b , c , ... ) = _ 1 [ sys11 g ] + b(b , c , ... ) = _ 2 [ sys21 g ]    if the target choice is a single alternative , then @xmath57 .",
    "_ the solutions of the system ( [ sys11g]-[sys21 g ] ) are considered as reflexive control strategies .",
    "the solution of the inverse task in particular is characterized from two points .",
    "the first point is whether it is required to find the influence of a particular single subject or joint influences of a group of subjects .",
    "the second one is whether the target choice is represented as a single alternative or as an interval of alternatives .    to illustrate these points , we introduce a particular group of subjects .",

    "this simple example illustrates the very gist of the _ inverse task _ - to find the appropriate influences , which result in target choice .",

    "these pairs are solutions of the system ( [ sysinf11]-[sysinf12 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we run all the possible values of variable @xmath4 and check if the first equation of the system ( [ sysinf11]-[sysinf12 ] ) turns into true equality : + @xmath67 ; + @xmath68 ; + @xmath69 ; + @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , out of four possible values of variable @xmath4 , only two values @xmath36 and @xmath71 are appropriate .",

    "we have formulated the inverse task in general and considered its particular formalization depending on the number of influences and what is the target choice .",

    "the module 2 is the new module , which is intrinsic for robotic agents studied in the context of mixed groups of humans and robots .",
    "this module is responsible for extraction of only harmless or non - risky alternatives for human subject .",
    "we suggest to apply asimov s three laws of robotics @xcite , which formulate the basics of the module 2 : + 1 ) a robot may not injure a human being or , through inaction , allow a human being to come to harm ; + 2 ) a robot must obey any orders given to it by human beings , except where such orders would conflict with the first law ; + 3 ) a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law .",

    "this can be done by convincing human subjects to choose alternatives from the set @xmath177 .",

    ", if set @xmath207 is not empty , this means that there exist at least one reflexive control strategy that results in selection of alternative from the set of the approved ( non - risky ) ones .",
    "therefore , the bcsra inherits the entire structure of the bcsas and augments it with module 2 of asimov s laws together with interaction modules 1 and 2 .",
    "the original schema of robot s control system has been recently presented in @xcite .",

    "robot achieves its goal by putting climber @xmath3 into frustration state , in which climber @xmath3 can not make any decision . on",
    "the other hand , set @xmath177 of approved alternatives guarantees that robot itself will choose the option with no risk for humans and implement it regardless of climber s influence .",
    "therefore , in this section we have illustrated robot s ability to refrain human being from risky actions and to perform these risky actions itself .",
    "this proves that our approach achieves both goals of robotic agent : 1 ) to refrain people from risky actions and 2 ) to perform risky actions itself regardless of human s influences .",
    "summarizing , the results of this paper , we outline the most important of them .",
    "first of all , we have introduced the inverse task and developed the ultimate methods to solve it .",
    "we have provided a comprehensive tutorial to the * brand new reflexive game theory * recently formulated and proposed by vladimir lefebvre @xcite .",
    "the tutoral contains the detailed description of the forward and inverse tasks together with methods to solve them .",
    "we propose control schemas for both abstract subject ( bcsas ) and robotic agent ( bcsra ) .",
    "these schemas were specially designed to incorporate solution of the forward and inverse tasks , thus providing us with autonomous units ( individuals , subjects , agents ) capable of making decisions in the human - like manner .",
    "we have shown that robotic agents based on bcsra can be easily included into the mixed groups of humans and robots and effectively serve their fundamental goals ( refraining humans from risky actions and , if needed , perform the risky acions itself ) .",
    "therefore , we consider that present study provides the comprehensive overview of the classic rgt proposed by vladimir lefebvre @xcite and newly developed self - consistent framework for analysis of different kinds of groups and societies , including human social groups and mixed groups of humans and robots together with application tutorial of this new framework .    this framework is entirely based on the principles of the rgt and brings together all its elements .",
    "the solution of the inverse task , presented in this paper , plays a crutial role in formation of this framework .",
    "therefore , by having the inverse task as one of its fundamentals , this framework illustrates the role of the inverse task and its relationship with other issues considered in the rgt .",
