    "rapid - purification protocols increase the rate at which the state of a system is purified by a continuous measurement  @xcite .",
    "they do this by applying feedback control to the system as the measurement proceeds .",
    "all such protocols described to date have been devised for continuous measurements of an observable ( that is , measurements that are not dissipative ) . under this kind of measurement the evolution of the system density matrix , @xmath0 ,",

    "the observers continuous measurement record , which we will denote by @xmath6 , is given by @xmath7 .",
    "this kind of measurement will project the system onto an eigenstate of @xmath2 after a time @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the difference between the two eigenvalues of @xmath2 that are nearest each other .",
    "photon counting and optical homodyning do not fall into the above class of measurements because they subject the system to dissipation .",
    "thus if one has a single optical qubit , consisting of a single mode containing no more than one photon , and one measures it with a photon counter , then regardless of whether the measurement tells us that the state was initially @xmath10 or @xmath11 , as @xmath12 the final state is always @xmath10 .",
    "if we wish we can think of this as a measurement of the photon number ( that is , a measurement in the class above with @xmath13 ) , followed by an irreversible operation that takes both @xmath10 and @xmath11 to the vaccum .",
    "our purpose here is to examine whether there exist rapid - purification feedback protocols for homodyne detection performed on a single optical qubit , and if so , to compare their properties with those pertaining to a continuous measurement of an observable on a single qubit .",
    "our motivation is partly theoretical interest regarding the effect of dissipation on rapid - purificaton protocols , and partly to explore whether such protocols can be implemented in an optical setting . before we begin it is worth recalling the properties of the single - qubit rapid - purification protocols that have been derived to date for non - dissipative measurements .",
    "the first is the protocol introduced by one of us  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) in which one applies feedback control to speed up the increase in the _ average _ purity of the system .",
    "the average here is taken over all possible realizations of the measurement ( all possible measurement records @xmath6 ) .",
    "the protocol involves applying feedback during the measurement to keep the bloch vector of the state of the qubit perpendicular to the basis of the measured observable , @xmath2 . in the limit of strong feedback , and high final average purity ,",
    "this provides a factor of two decrease in the time required to reach a given average purity . in the limit of strong feedback",
    "the protocol also eliminates the stochasticity in the purification process , so that the purity increases deterministically .",
    "the second protocol , introduced by wiseman and ralph  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) , involves applying feedback to keep the bloch vector parallel to the basis of the measured observable .",
    "( if the system has no appreciable hamiltonian , then the measurement will do this of its own accord , and feedback is not required . )",
    "this protocol minimizes the _ average time _",
    "one has to wait to reach a given purity .",
    "the decrease in this average waiting time over the previous protocol is a factor of two , and in this case the evolution of the purity is stochastic .    in the next section",
    "we examine homodyne detection of a single optical qubit , and derive a deterministic rapid - puritifcation protocol equivalent to the first protocol discussed above . in section  [ sec3 ]",
    "we calculate the performance of two protocols that are analogous in various ways to the wiseman - ralph protocol .",

    "the absence of feedback is not , however , the equivalent of the wiseman - ralph protocol , because in our case it does not necessarily provide the minimum value of @xmath67 . without loss of generality",
