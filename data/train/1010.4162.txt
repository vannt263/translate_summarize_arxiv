    "the mathematical modeling approach has made a great impact on these scientific fields over the past decades .",

    "the existing statistical methods for ode models include the nonlinear least squares method [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] , the smoothing - based techniques [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] , the principal differential analysis ( pda ) [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , varziri et al .",

    "kutta algorithm [ @xcite , @xcite ] have to be used to approximate the solution of the odes for a given set of parameter values and initial conditions .",
    "consequently , the nonlinear least squares ( nls ) principle ( minimizing the residual sum of squares of the differences between the experimental observations and numerical solutions ) can be used to obtain the estimates of the unknown parameters . the nls method for ( [ const_ode ] )",
    "was first described by mathematicians in 1970s [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "the nls method was also widely used to estimate the unknown parameters in ode models in the fields of mathematics , computer science and control engineering . in the 1990s ,",
    "the nls method was extended to estimate time - varying parameters in ( [ time_ode ] ) .",
    "for example , the nls method with spline approximation to time - varying parameters has been successfully applied to pharmacokinetic [ @xcite ] , physiologic [ @xcite ] and hiv studies [ @xcite ] .    though the nls was the earliest and the most popular method developed for estimating the parameters in ode models , so far the proposed nls estimators and their asymptotic properties for ode models have not been systematically studied , in particular , for time - varying parameter estimates .",
    "the influence of the numerical approximation error of odes on the asymptotic properties has not been analyzed .",
    "all existing studies took the numerical solution as the true solution and did not consider the difference between them .",

    "the rest of the article is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    ", we discuss the identifiability problem of ode models .",
    "then we introduce the numerical solution - based nls estimators for ( [ const_ode ] ) and ( [ time_ode ] ) , and study their asymptotic properties in sections [ sec3 ] and [ sec4 ] , respectively . the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators , including strong consistency , rate of convergence and asymptotic normalities , are established using the tools of empirical processes [ pollard ( @xcite , @xcite ) , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] and the sieve methods [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ] .",
    "we perform simulation studies to investigate the finite - sample performance of the proposed estimation methods in section [ sec5 ] . in this section",
    ", we also apply the proposed approaches to a set of ode models for hiv dynamics .",
    "we provide a summary and discussion for the proposed methods in section [ sec6 ] .",
    "finally , the proofs of all the theoretical results are given in the .",
    "identifiability of ode models is a critical question to answer before parameter estimation . to verify the uniqueness of parameter estimates for given system inputs and outputs ,",
    "both analytical and numerical techniques have been developed for ode models since 1950s . before jumping into technical details ,",
    "two commonly used definitions of identifiability are given as follows [ @xcite , cobelli , lepschy and jacur ( @xcite ) , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] .    globally identifiable :",
    "a system structure is said to be globally identifiable if for any two parameter vectors @xmath25 and @xmath26 in the parameter space @xmath27 , @xmath28 can be satisfied for all @xmath29 if and only if @xmath30 .    however , global identifiability is a strong condition to satisfy and usually difficult to verify in practice .",
    "therefore , the definition of at - a - point identifiability was introduced by @xcite and @xcite as follows .    at - a - point",
    "identifiable : a system structure is said to be locally ( or globally ) identifiable at a point @xmath31 if for any @xmath6 within an open neighborhood of @xmath31 ( or within the entire parameter space ) , @xmath32 can be satisfied for all @xmath29 if and only if @xmath33 .",
    "a number of methods have been proposed for identifiability analysis of ode models , including _ structural _ [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] , _ practical _ [ e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ] and _ sensitivity - based _",
    "[ e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ] approaches . due to the limited space",
    ", we may not be able to provide an exhaustive list of publications on identifiability of ode models . in this article , the structural identifiability analysis techniques are of particular interest mainly due to the theoretical completeness .",
    "various structural identifiability approaches have been proposed , such as power series expansion [ @xcite ] , similarity transformation [ @xcite , @xcite ] and implicit function theorem method [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] . particularly , @xcite and @xcite introduced another approach in the framework of differential algebra [ @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "the differential algebra approach is suitable to general nonlinear dynamic systems , and it has been successfully applied to nonlinear differential equation models , including models with time - varying parameters [ @xcite ] . in this article ,",
    "the differential algebra approach is employed to verify the identifiability of ode models with both constant and time - varying parameters .    for most structural identifiability analysis techniques such as the implicit function theorem method and the differential algebra approach , a key step is the elimination of latent variables via taking derivatives and algebraic operations , which makes such techniques suitable for multivariate ode models with partially observed state variables . after all unobserved state variables are eliminated ,",
    "equations involving only given inputs , measured outputs and unknown parameters can be obtained . if we consider the parameters as unknowns , it is easy to verify that the identifiability of unknown parameters is determined by the number of roots of these equations .    for illustration purposes ,",
    "we consider a classical hiv dynamic model with both constant and time - varying parameters [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] as an example : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the concentration of uninfected target cd4@xmath36 @xmath37 cells , @xmath38 the concentration of infected cd4@xmath36 @xmath37 cells , @xmath39 the viral load , @xmath40 the proliferation rate of uninfected cd4@xmath36 @xmath37 cells , @xmath41 the death rate of uninfected cd4@xmath36 @xmath37 cells , @xmath42 the time - varying infection rate depending on antiviral drug efficacy , @xmath43 the death rate of infected cells , @xmath44 the clearance rate of free virions , @xmath45 the number of virions produced by a single infected cell on average .",
    "this model will also be used in our numerical studies in section [ sec5 ] . for notational simplicity ,",
    "let @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 denote @xmath35 , @xmath38 and @xmath49 , and let @xmath50 and @xmath51 denote the measurable outputs , respectively .",
    "then ( [ hiv_model ] ) can be re - written as @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 denote the derivatives of @xmath55 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "we adopt the following ranking for variable elimination [ @xcite ] , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the vector of constant unknown parameters . by taking the higher order derivatives on both sides of ( [ odex ] ) and using some algebra elimination techniques ,",
    "we can eliminate @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 from ( [ odex ] ) using the ranking ( [ 3dmodelranking ] ) to obtain @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 denote the second - order derivative of @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "therefore , @xmath9 can be expressed in terms of measurable system outputs and other constant unknown parameters either from ( [ e : cseteq1 ] ) as @xmath63 or from ( [ e : cseteq2 ] ) as @xmath64 thus , @xmath9 is identifiable if all the constant unknown parameters are identifiable . to verify the identifiability of all unknown parameters @xmath65 , equations ( [ eta1 ] ) and ( [ eta2 ] )",

    "we assume that the derivatives of @xmath67 and @xmath49 exist and are continuous up to order 2 .",
    "although the derivatives of @xmath67 and @xmath49 are usually not directly measured in experiments , for theoretical identifiability analysis , they are known once @xmath67 and @xmath49 are measured ( e.g. , via numerical evaluation ) .",
    "finally , it can be verified that ( [ cupid ] ) is of order 0 and of degree @xmath68 in @xmath69 , so ( [ cupid ] ) satisfies the sufficient conditions given in @xcite and @xmath70 is thus at - a - point identifiable at the true parameter point .",

    "<S> this article considers estimation of constant and time - varying coefficients in nonlinear ordinary differential equation ( ode ) models where analytic closed - form solutions are not available . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical solution - based nonlinear least squares ( nls ) estimator is investigated in this study . a numerical algorithm such as the runge  kutta method is used to approximate the ode solution . </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic properties are established for the proposed estimators considering both numerical error and measurement error . </S>",
    "<S> the b - spline is used to approximate the time - varying coefficients , and the corresponding asymptotic theories in this case are investigated under the framework of the sieve approach . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that if the maximum step size of the @xmath0-order numerical algorithm goes to zero at a rate faster than @xmath1 , the numerical error is negligible compared to the measurement error . </S>",
    "<S> this result provides a theoretical guidance in selection of the step size for numerical evaluations of odes . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we have shown that the numerical solution - based nls estimator and the sieve nls estimator are strongly consistent . </S>",
    "<S> the sieve estimator of constant parameters is asymptotically normal with the same asymptotic co - variance as that of the case where the true ode solution is exactly known , while the estimator of the time - varying parameter has the optimal convergence rate under some regularity conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical results are also developed for the case when the step size of the ode numerical solver does not go to zero fast enough or the numerical error is comparable to the measurement error . we illustrate our approach with both simulation studies and clinical data on hiv viral dynamics .    ,    and    .    </S>"
