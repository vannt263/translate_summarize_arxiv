    "the effect of electron correlations on the properties of different materials is currently among the most burning problems of the condensed matter physics . as a rule ,",
    "strong electron correlations are accompanied by the formation of nanoscale inhomogeneous states  @xcite .",
    "such inhomogeneities have been already studied for several decades . in particular ,",
    "they were widely discussed for high-@xmath2 superconductors  @xcite and heavy fermion materials  @xcite . in the recent years",
    ", they attract a special attention owing to the discovery of the colossal magnetoresistance effect in manganites ( the nature of which is believed to be closely related to inhomogeneous structures  @xcite ) .",
    "the inhomogeneities manifest themselves in other magnetic materials such as cobaltites  @xcite , nickelates  @xcite and also in low - dimensional magnets  @xcite .",
    "all these systems are characterized by a strong interplay of spin , charge , and orbital degrees of freedom leading to rather rich phase diagrams .",
    "one of the first most spectacular examples of such kind of inhomogeneities is the formation of ferromagnetic ( fm ) droplets ( magnetic polarons or ferrons ) in antiferromagnetic ( af ) semiconductors at low doping levels as well as fm spin polarons in the paramagnetic state  @xcite .",
    "these examples correspond to the case of so called electron phase separation caused by self - trapping of charge carriers , which change their local environment .",
    "in addition to such a small - scale phase separation , in manganites , as well as in other compounds exhibiting first order transitions ( e.g. , between fm and af phases ) , there also arises the phase separation of another type related to rather wide region where different phases coexist .",
    "an example of such large - scale phase separation is the formation of rather large fm droplets with the size of the order of ( 100 - 1000 ) @xmath3 inside the af matrix  @xcite . at higher doping levels close to the",
    "half - filling , there appears one more threshold for the phase separation in the system corresponding again to the formation of ferromagnetic droplets , but now in a charge - ordered insulating matrix  @xcite .",
    "the interaction of spin , charge , and orbital degrees of freedom can also lead to the formation of stripe structures instead of droplets at high content of the alkaline - earth element  @xcite . in manganites , owing to the strong electron - lattice interactions , such structures are related to the lattice distortions and can be observed by the electron diffraction and the low - angle neutron scattering  @xcite .",
    "both analytical and numerical studies in various models related to the strongly correlated electrons exhibit a pronounced tendency toward phase separation in a wide range of temperatures and electron or hole concentrations . among these , we can mention @xmath4  @xcite , @xmath5  @xcite , hubbard  @xcite , and falicov - kimball  @xcite models .    the theoretical models usually imply that the number of charge carriers introduced by doping is equal to the number of itinerant electrons which take part in the formation of nanoscale inhomogeneities .",
    "however , the comparison of experimental data with the theoretical results suggests that such an approach is insufficient  @xcite and the number of self - trapped carriers can significantly differ from the doping level  @xcite .    here",
    ", we analyze the model proposed in our paper ref .  , which relates the doping level and the number of charge carriers .",
    "we take into account the jahn - teller ( jt ) nature of magnetic ions , which could give rise to the localization of charge carriers at the lattice distortions .",
    "we introduce this localization effect to the kondo - lattice model in the double exchange limit . beginning from seminal paper , ref .",
    ", the role of jt distortions was widely discussed in literature  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "such distortions were taken into consideration in refs .   in the analysis of the phase diagram of doped manganites . however , none of these papers dealt with the phase separation phenomena . in our paper ,",
    "the main emphasis is made on the studying the phase diagram in the doping ",
    "temperature ( @xmath1 ) plane and its evolution under effect of the applied magnetic field .",
    "first , let us note that the doped manganites , ( re@xmath6mn@xmath6)(a@xmath7mn@xmath8)o@xmath9 , are the compounds with mixed valence . here",
    "re is a trivalent rare - earth element and a is a bivalent alkaline - earth element .",
    "the ions mn@xmath10 and mn@xmath11 have @xmath12 and @xmath13 electron configurations , respectively . in such compounds ,",
    "manganese ions are located in the centers of o@xmath14 octahedra . in a regular octahedron ,",
    "a five - fold degenerate @xmath15 level is split into triple- and double - degenerate levels , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) , respectively .",
    "the @xmath16 level lies lower than @xmath20 level .",
    "manganese ions are characterized by the strong hund s rule coupling giving rise to the parallel alignment of intra - atomic electron spins .",
    "so , the spins of @xmath16 electrons form local spin @xmath23 . in a regular mno@xmath14 octahedron ,",
    "mn@xmath10 ion has one electron at double - degenerate @xmath20 level  @xcite . according to the jahn - teller theorem , the latter configuration is unstable and the degeneracy is lifted by a distortion of the octahedron .",
    "the mn@xmath11 is not a jahn - teller ion and mn@xmath11o@xmath14 octahedron remains undistorted .",
    "the distortion of mn@xmath10o@xmath14 octahedron leads to the energy lowering by @xmath24 . in doped manganites ,",
    "the @xmath20 electron can hop from mn@xmath10 to mn@xmath11 ion producing a gain in the kinetic energy due to electron delocalization .",
    "therefore , an electron can lower its energy either due to the jahn - teller - induced localization at distorted octahedra or by the delocalization related to the inter - atomic hopping .",
    "the strong hund s rule coupling favors the hopping of an electron when its spin is parallel to the spin of core ( @xmath16 ) electrons .",
    "this is the origin of the well - known double - exchange mechanism of ferromagnetic interaction between the localized spins  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is natural to assume that the @xmath25 electron can be either localized due to jahn - teller distortions with the energy gain @xmath24 ( @xmath26 electron ) or to decrease its energy due to band broadening ( @xmath27 electron )  @xcite .",
    "so , there exists a competition between the localization and delocalization .",

    "@xmath42 is the antiferromagnetic ( @xmath43 ) exchange interaction between local spins .",
    "the @xmath44 term takes into account interactions between @xmath20 electrons and vibrational modes for the mno@xmath14 octahedra , here @xmath45 is the elastic energy and @xmath46 is the electron - lattice coupling constant .",

    "@xmath35 , respectively .",
    "we consider the limit @xmath48 characteristic of manganites . in this case , the spin of @xmath25 electrons is parallel to @xmath49 and we can eliminate the spin indices by the transformation of @xmath50 to operators @xmath51 with spin projection @xmath52 onto the direction of @xmath36 accompanied by the transformation of hopping amplitudes  @xcite : @xmath53 , where @xmath54 .",
    "in addition , we assume that @xmath55 for @xmath26 electrons , which produce maximum splitting of @xmath20 level with the energy gain @xmath56 , whereas @xmath27 electrons with non - zero hopping integrals @xmath57 produce smaller distortions of mno@xmath14 octahedra .",
    "preliminary calculations for the case @xmath58 demonstrated that the results are not significantly affected if the localized band is much narrower than itinerant one .",

    ", we limit ourselves by the case of the large on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath68 , which strongly suppresses double occupancy of the site . moreover , at large @xmath68 , the characteristic time of existence for a double electron state is of the order of @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the characteristic jt phonon frequency ( @xmath77 ) , which is of the order of debye frequency . therefore , the adiabatic approximation for the jahn - teller distortions is applicable . as a result , the jt term in eq",
    "is determined only by localized electrons .",

    "thus , @xmath82 does not vary by orders of magnitude and the bandwidth ratio remains small .",
    "to study the effects of temperature , we use the mean field ( mf ) approximation .",
