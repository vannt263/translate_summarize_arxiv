    "sax j1753.5@xmath02349  is a neutron star low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) discovered in 1996 by _ bepposax_/wide field camera ( wfc ) during a single type - i x - ray burst @xcite .",
    "however , no steady emission was detected from the source leading to an upper limit of about 5 mcrab ( 28 kev ) for a total exposure of 300 ks @xcite .",
    "cornelisse et al .",
    "( 2004 ) proposed sax j1753.5@xmath02349  being member of a possible non - homogeneous class of lmxbs , the so - called `` burst - only '' sources ( see also cocchi et al .",
    "these are a group of nine bursters discovered by _ bepposax_/wfc when exhibiting a type - i burst without any detectable persistent x - ray emission .",
    "recently , _ integral",
    "_  identified two new members of this class .",
    "in fact , photospheric radius expansion ( pre ) bursts have been caught in two previously unclassified sources , namely  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "afterwards , both have been classified as `` quasi - persistent '' very faint x - ray transients ( vfxts ) , since they undergo prolonged accretion episodes of many years at low  ( del santo et al .",
    "2007 , bassa et al . 2008 ) .",
    "vfxts are transients showing outbursts with low peak luminosity ( @xmath210@xmath3  in 210 kev ) , mainly discovered with high sensitivity instruments on - board _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  during surveys of the galactic center region @xcite .",
    "they are believed to be the faintest known accretors , and are very likely a non homogeneous class of sources .",
    "a significant fraction ( @xmath4 ) of vfxts are x - ray bursters ( degenaar & wijnands 2009 , del santo et al .",
    "2007 , del santo et al .",
    "2008 , cornelisse et al .",
    "2004 ) ; thus they can be identified with neutron stars accreting matter from a low mass companion ( m @xmath5 1 ) .",
    ".log of the _ integral _",
    "observations of the sax j1753.5@xmath02349  region : orbit number ( rev . ) , start and end time of the observations , exposures time for each orbit taking into account the whole data - set , and number of pointings ( scw ) are reported .",
    "observations within a single orbit are not continuous .",
    "the first _ integral _  detection of sax j1753.5@xmath02349  occurred in rev .",
    "732 . a data sub - set from rev .",
    "732 to 736 has been used to compute the averaged spectra .",
    "the last column reports the exposures of spectra in each orbit .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : fit_sim ]    the bolometric flux of the unabsorbed best - fit model spectrum .",
    "we report here for the first time the broad - band spectrum , from soft to hard x - rays , of the persistent emission from a so - called `` burst - only '' source .",
    "in particular , none of these sources have ever been studied above 10 kev during their persistent emission .",
    "the outburst from sax j1753.5@xmath02349  observed with _",
    "integral_/ibis has a duration of at least 14 days , without any evidence for type - i x - ray bursts , all along the performed _ integral _",
    "observations of the galactic centre region started in 2003 .    from the _ rxte_/pca flux detection at 8 mcrab @xcite we can derive an absorbed 210 kev peak flux of about @xmath6  which translates in an unabsorbed luminosity higher than @xmath7 .",
    "this value seems to indicate sax j1753.5@xmath02349  being a hybrid system ( such as ax j1745.62901 and grs 1741.92853 , see degenaar & wijnands 2009 ) which displays very - faint outbursts with 210 kev peak luminosity @xmath8  ( as resulted from wfc observations in 1996 ) , as well as outbursts with luminosities in the range @xmath9 , which are classified as faint ( fxt ; wijnands et al .",
    "however , it is worth to know that the @xmath10 boundary as @xmath11  is somewhat arbitrary ( such as the vfxt / fxt classification )",
    ". nevertheless , our result reinforces the hypothesis that the so - called `` burst - only '' sources belong to the class of the subluminous neutron star x - ray binaries .",
    "a rough estimate of the duty cycle ( as the ratio of @xmath12 ) can be obtained .",
    "the time interval between the two 2008 measurements of the quiescence ( february 2008-march 2009 ) is about 13 months while the outburst recurrence ( @xmath13 ) is about 12 years ( from the burst event in 1996 ) .",
    "however , it is possible that we missed other outbursts of sax j1753.5@xmath02349  that occurred between 1996 and 2008 whithin periods not covered by galactic centre monitoring .",
    "the outburst duration ( @xmath14 ) ranges from a minimum of 14 days ( as observed ) and a maximum of 13 months , since there are not any other x - ray observations but the ones in october .",
    "in fact , we can not exclude that the hard x - ray outburst may be part of a longer outburst occurred at a lower luminosity level , only detectable by high - sensitivity x - ray telescopes .",
    "this translates into a duty cycle ranging from a minimum of 0.3@xmath15 to a maximum of 9@xmath15 and into a long - term time - averaged accretion rate ( @xmath16 ) ranging from 2.2@xmath17@xmath18 to 6.0@xmath17@xmath19 m@xmath20 yr@xmath21 .",
    "king & wijnands ( 2006 ) suggested that neutron star in transient lmxbs with low time - averaged mass accretion rate might pose difficulties explaining their existence without invoking exotic scenarios such as accretion from a planetary donor .",
    "however , the regime of @xmath22 estimated for sax j1753.5@xmath02349  can be well explained within current lmxb evolution models .    in spite of the flux variability along the outburst ,",
    "the spectral state of sax j1753.5@xmath02349  remains steady , in low / hard state .",
    "this is in agreement with the fact that a really low x - ray luminosity , @xmath10 @xmath23 or so , produces a hard state in most sources @xcite .    following int zand et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , we have estimated the hardness ratio 40100/2040 kev within each _ integral _  revolutions .",
    "we find a value consistent with 1 which confirms the hard nature of the system .",
    "this is also consistent with the low mass accretion rate inferred ( see also paizis et al .",
    "2006 ) , i. e. sax j1753.5@xmath02349  is not a fake faint system and there would be no reason to assume that the system is obscured to explain the low .",
    "moreover , king ( 2000 ) argued that the faint low - mass x - ray transients are mainly neutron star x - ray binaries in very compact binaries with orbital periods lower than 80 min .",
    "we suggest that the sax j1753.5@xmath02349  system is a good candidate to harbor an accreting neutron star in a very compact system .    in conclusion ,",
    "sax j1753.5@xmath02349  joins a sample of low - luminosity transient lmxbs @xcite , which display different behaviour in terms of peak luminosity , outburst duration and recurrence time from year to year . up to now , it is not understood whether these variations should be interpreted as being due to changes in the mass - transfer rate or as results of instabilities in the accretion disc ( degenar & wijnands 2009 and reference therein ) .",
    "data analysis is supported by the italian space agency ( asi ) , via contracts asi / integral i/008/07/0 , asi i/088/06/0 .",
    "mds thanks memmo federici for the _ integral _  data archival support at iasf - roma .",
