    "( 2014c ) showed that , in the shakura - sunyaev regime , retrograde accretion onto a bh can lead to shorter h@xmath1 lags .",
    "the reason is due to the suppression of ionizing photons in retrograde accretion compared with prograde accretion .",
    "the second factor stems from self - shadowing effects of the inner part of slim disks ( e.g. , li et al . 2010 ) , which efficiently lower the ionizing flux received by the blr ( wang et al .",
    "when @xmath120 increases , the ratio of the disk height to disk radius increases due to radiation pressure ; the radiation field becomes anisotropic ( much stronger than the factor of @xmath434 ) due to the optically thick funnel of the inner part of the slim disk . in principle , the radiation from a slim disk saturates ( @xmath435 ) , and the total ionizing luminosity slightly increases with accretion rate , but the self - shadowing effects efficiently suppress the ionizing flux to the blr clouds . for face - on disks of type 1 agns ,",
    "observers receive the intrinsic luminosity .",
    "if the ionization parameter is constant , the ionization front will significantly shrink , and hence the h@xmath1 lag is shortened in seambhs compared with sub - eddington agns of the same luminosity .    the shortened h@xmath1 lag observed in seambhs can not be caused by retrograde accretion .",
    "however , the strong dependence on accretion rate of the deviation from the standard lag - luminosity relation implies that the properties of the ionizing sources are somehow different from those in sub - eddington agns . according to the standard photoionization theory ,",
    "the observed @xmath436 relation can be explained if @xmath437 and @xmath438 is constant , where @xmath439 , @xmath440 is the ionizing luminosity , @xmath441 is gas density of blr clouds , and @xmath442 is the average energy of the ionizing photons ( bentz et al . 2013 ) .",
    "the relation @xmath437 holds for sub - eddington agns , and the constancy of @xmath443 is determined by the clouds themselves .",

    "therefore , the reduction of the h@xmath1 lag can , in principle , reach up to a factor of a few , even 10 , as observed .",

    "the objects in our seambh sample are very similar to nls1s . as previous rm agn samples include nls1s , why have previous studies not noticed that nls1s deviate from the @xmath3 relation ( e.g. , figure 2 in bentz 2011 ) ?",
    "we believe that the reason is two - fold .",
    "first , the number of nls1s included in previous rm campaigns was quite limited ( denney et al .",
    "2009 , 2010 ; bentz et al .",
    "2008 , 2009 ; see summary in bentz 2011 ) .",
    "the level of optical variability in nls1s is generally very low ( klimek et al .",
    "2004 ) , and many previous attempts at rm have proved to be unsuccessful ( e.g. , giannuzzo & stirpe 1996 ; giannuzzo et al .",
    "second , not all nls1s are necessarily highly accreting .",
    "our seambh sample was selected to have high accretion rates ( see @xmath120 listed in table 7 of paper iv ) , generally higher than that of typical nls1s previously studied successfully through rm . as discussed in wang et al .",
    "( 2014b ) and in paper iv , high accretion rates lead to anisotropic ionizing radiation , which may explain the shortened blr lags .          once its discovery , quasars as the brightest celestial objects in the universe had been suggested for cosmology ( sandage 1965 ; hoyle & burbidge 1966 ; longair & scheuer 1967 ; schmidt 1968 ; bahcall & hills 1973 ; burbidge & odell 1973 ; baldwin et al .",
    "unfortunately , the diversity of observed quasars made these early attempts elusive .",
    "after five decades since its discovery , quasars are much well understood : accretion onto supermassive black holes is powering the giant radiation , in particular , the bh mass can be reliably measured .",
    "quasars as the most powerful emitters renewed interests for cosmology in several independent ways : 1 ) the normal @xmath3 relation ( horn et al .",
    "2003 ; watson et al . 2011 ; czerny et al .",
    "2013 ) ; 2 ) the linear relation between bh mass and luminosity in super - eddington quasars ( wang et al . 2013",
    "; paper - ii ) ; 3 ) eddington agns selected by eigenvector 1 ( marziani & sulentic 2014 ) ; 4 ) x - ray variabilities ( la franca et al . 2014 ) and 5 ) @xmath462 relation ( risaliti & lusso 2015 ) .",
    "these parallel methods will be justified for cosmology by their feasibility of experiment periods and measurement accuracy .",
    "the strength of seambhs makes its application more convenient for cosmology .",
    "selection of seambhs only depends on single epoch spectra through the fundamental plane ( equation 10 ) .",
    "bh mass can be estimated by the new scaling relation ( equation 7 ) .",
    "we will apply the scheme outlined by wang et al .",
    "( 2014a ) to the sample of selected seambhs for cosmology in a statistical way ( in preparation ) . on the other hand , the shortened h@xmath1 lags",
    "greatly reduce monitoring periods if seambhs are applied as standard candles , in particular , the reduction of lags govern by super - eddington accretion can cancel the cosmological dilltion factor of @xmath463 . otherwise , the monitoring periods of sub - eddington agns should be extended by the same factor of @xmath463 for measurements of h@xmath1 lags .",
    "such a campaign of using the normal @xmath3 relation for cosmology will last for a couple of years , even 10 years for bright high@xmath464 quasars . similarly to extension of the @xmath3 relation to - and -lines ( vestergaard & peterson 2006 ) , we can extend equation ( 7 ) to and lines for the scaling relations with luminosity as @xmath465 and @xmath466 , respectively , where @xmath467 and @xmath468 are sizes of the and regions , and @xmath469 is the 3000  luminosity .",
    "such extended relations conveniently allow us to investigate cosmology by making use of large samples of high@xmath464 quasars without time - consuming rm campaigns .",
    "it is urgent for us to make use of kinds of standard candles to test the growing evidence for dynamical dark energy ( e.g. , zhao et al .",
    "2012 ; ade et al .",
    "we present the results of the third year of reverberation mapping of super - eddington accreting massive black holes ( seambhs ) .",
    "h@xmath1 lags of five new seambhs have been detected .",
    "similar to the seambh2012 and seambh2013 samples , we find that the seambh2014 objects generally have shorter h@xmath1 lags than the normal @xmath3 relation , by a factor of a few . in total",
    ", we have detected h@xmath1 lags for 18 seambhs from this project , which have accretion rates from @xmath470 to @xmath471 .",
    "the entire seambh sample allows us to establish a new scaling relation for the blr size , which depends not only on luminosity but also on accretion rate .",
    "the new relation , applicable over a wide range of accretion rates from @xmath472 to @xmath14 , is given by @xmath7 $ ] , where @xmath8 is 5100  continuum luminosity , and coefficients of @xmath9lt - d , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .    .",
    "the validity of equation ( 3 ) can be justified for application to seambhs .",
    "solutions of slim disks are transonic and usually given only by numerical calculations ( abramowicz et al .",
    "when the accretion rate of the disk is high enough , the complicated structure of the disk reduces to a self - similar , analytical form ( wang & zhou 1999 ) . using the self - similar solutions ( wang & zhou 1999 ; wang et al .",
    "1999 ) , we obtained the radius of disk region emitting optical ( 5100  ) photons , @xmath473 and the photon - trapping radius @xmath474 we used the blackbody relation @xmath475 , where @xmath476 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath477 is the effective temperature of the disk surface , @xmath478 is the planck constant , and @xmath479 cm is the schwartzschild radius",
    ". equation ( 3 ) holds provided @xmath480 , namely @xmath481 in this regime , optical radiation is not influenced by photon - trapping effects .",
    "we would also like to point out that the bh spin only affects emission from the innermost regions of the accretion disk rather than the regions emitting 5100  photons .",
    "in the present campaign , no seambh so far has been found to exceed this critical value . beyond this critical value of accretion rate , optical photons",
    "are trapped by the accretion flow .",
    "we call this the hyper - accretion regime .    here",
    "the cited @xmath482 below equation ( 3 ) is not a strict value of the adaf threshold since it depends on several factors , such as viscosity and outer boundary conditions .",
    "there are a few mapped agns with @xmath483 ( ngc 4151 , ngc 5273 , 3c 390.3 and ngc 5548 ; see table 7 in paper iv ) , but we do not discuss them in this paper because they do not influence our conclusions .",
    "recently , reprocessing of x - rays ( e.g. , frank et al .",
    "2002 ; cackett et al .",
    "2007 ) has been found to play an important role in explaining the variability properties of ngc 5548 ( e.g. , fausnaugh et al .",
    "2015 ) . the fraction of x - ray emission to the bolometric luminosity strongly anti - correlates with the eddington ratio ( see figure 1 in wang et al .",
    "this result is usually interpreted to mean that the hot corona becomes weaker with increasing accretion rate , as a result of more efficiently cooling of the corona by uv and optical photons from the cold disk .",
    "this suggests that agns with high accretion rates will have less reprocessed emission , such that equation ( 3 ) would be more robust in seambhs .",
    "in order to avoid selecting variable stars as comparison stars , we examined their variability . to test the invariance of the comparison stars used in our spectroscopic observation , we performed differential photometry by comparing them with other stars in the same field .",
    "we typically use six stars for the differential photometry .",
    "the light curves of the stars are shown in figure 7 .",
    "on average , the standard deviations in the light curves of the comparison stars are 1% .",
    "this guarantees that they can be used as standards for spectral calibration .",
    "figure 7 shows the light curves of the comparison stars for each seambh targets .",
    "the averaged and rms spectra of the seambh2014 sample are provided in this appendix . following the standard way",
    ", we calculated the averaged spectrum as @xmath484 and the rms spectrum as @xmath485^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath486 is the @xmath487th observed spectrum and @xmath386 is the total number of observed spectra .",
    "they are shown in figure 8 .",
    "we note that both the averaged and rms spectra are affected by the broadening effects of the @xmath184-slit on the observed profiles . using the richards - lucy iteration",
    ", we can correct the observed profiles ( averaged and rms ) for velocity - resolved mapping , which will be carried out in a separate paper ( du et al .",
    "we briefly remark on individual objects for which h@xmath1 lags have been successfully measured . we failed in getting lag measurements for the other five objects because either their flux variations are very small or the data sampling rate was inadequate .    _",
    "j075949 _ :",
    "the detected h@xmath1 lag arises from two major peaks in the light curves .    _",
    "j080131 _ : the monitoring observations during @xmath488 did not yield a well - determined h@xmath1 lag because of the lack of h@xmath1 response to the second continuum flare ( see paper iv ) . during @xmath488 , the first reverberation of h@xmath1 , which can be clearly seen during the first 70 days of the light curves , yields a very significant lag , as shown in the ccf with a rest - frame centroid lag of @xmath489 days ( with a very high coefficient of @xmath490 ) .",
    "we monitored this object again in this observing season ( figure 1 ) .",
    "we successfully measure @xmath491 days , consistent with last season s result .    _",
    "j084533 _ :",
    "its continuum slightly decreased before being monitored for @xmath492 days , and steadily increased until @xmath493 days and then decreased again .",
    "although the ccf has a very flat peak close to @xmath494 , monte carlo simulations show that h@xmath1 lag is around 20 days , which arises from the two peaks in the h@xmath1 and @xmath163-band light curves .    _",
    "j085946 _ : the ccf peaks near 0.6 , which results from the two major dips in the h@xmath1 and @xmath163-band light curves .",
    "there are two peaks with roughly the same correlation coefficients around @xmath17020 days and @xmath17070 days in the observed frame , respectively . considering the relatively poor data quality of this object , it is difficult to distinguish which is the true response .",
    "the centroid lag represents the average of these two peaks ( responses ) , and its uncertainties cover the distribution ( figure 1 ) obtained in fr / rss method .",
    "so , we use it in the analysis of main text .    _",
    "j102339 _ : the detected lag is from the dip feature around @xmath495 days in light curves .",
    "for multiple - peaked ccfs with similar correlation coefficients , it is ambiguous as to which peak should be used to calculate the final lag . in such cases",
    ", we use the cccd to determine the lag .",
    "however , there are two approaches to calculate the centroid time lag in the ccf , as illustrated in figure 9 .      in approach 1",
    ", the cccd tends to be smoother than the ccpd ( see figure 1 ) , whereas in in approach 2 the cccd and ccpd always have a similar distribution .",
    "we adopt approach 1 in our analysis .",
    "if the ccf has two or even three peaks , the two approaches give different centroid lags .",
    "however , when the quality of the data is high and the ccf is unimodal , the two approaches yield the same results .",
    "it should be pointed out that approach 2 is often employed in the literature ."
