    "a detailed analysis of such a nova , v4743sgr , was recently presented by @xcite .",
    "they used plane - parallel , hydrostatic models calculated with the tbingen nlte model - atmosphere package ( ) .",
    "although the velocity field and the expansion of the nova s atmosphere was neglected , the overall slope of the continuum flux was well reproduced .",
    "moreover , the strengths of prominent photospheric absorption lines ( cv , cvi , nvi , nvii , ovii ) as well as the strengths of absorption edges were in very good agreement with the observation ( fig.[fig : cn ] , [ fig : final ] ) .",

    "_ tmap _ model atmospheres were successfully employed for spectral analyses of hot , compact stars .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for a brief summary of this application to a variety of objects from post - agb stars ( @xmath3 ) to neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binaries ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "_ what do we need to analyze x - ray spectra taken during the sss phase following a nova outburst reliably ? _ the evolution of both stars has to be modeled , including e.g. stellar rotation , mass - loss history , common - envelope phase , and a long series of outbursts .",
    "thus , 3-dimensional magneto - hydrodynamical calculations that follow the stars for a long time are definitely the best choice .",
    "in addition , 3d nlte radiation transfer , accounting for the expanding atmosphere and mass loss not only during the outburst , clumping in the ejected matter , etc .",
    "is necessary .",
    "this should be combined with 3d photoionization modeling to describe the surrounding gas and dust .",
    "although all these state - of - the - art ingredients are already available , their combination and application to an individual nova system is still a dream .    in the case of v4743 sgr , @xcite measured a blueshift ( @xmath5 ) in the _ chandra _ spectrum .",
    "this strong evidence for expansion was found in the sss spectra of other novae as well ( ( * ? ? ?",

    ", one has to conclude that , of course only in case of higher mass - loss rates ( @xmath8 ) , spectral analyses of ssss based on hydrostatic model atmospheres tend to overestimate @xmath9 and metal abundances .",
    "the question remains , _ why do the static tmap models reproduce the observations that well _",
    "( fig.[fig : final ] ) _ ? _ the answer may be very simple  the strong mass - loss phase of v4743 sgr is over . obviously , there are no pcygni line profiles observed and thus , the `` wind - blown '' material around v4743 sgr is not dense enough to provide the emission .",
    "the matter in the line of sight is still moving towards us and thus , we see blueshifted , pure absorption lines",
