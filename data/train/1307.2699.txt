    "<S> in contrast to the classical model system of colloids @xcite , the actual dynamics after the initial thermalization corresponds to that of an isolated system ( micro - canonical ) . however , this does not influence the long tail part in the relaxation which is independent of the microscopic dynamics @xcite .     </S>",

    "<S> regions of low order ( @xmath88 ) feature large diffusion and larger quantum fluctuations . </S>",

    "<S> the cloud of maker molecules placed in an inactive region ( green ) of the glass follows the dynamics of an amorphous crystal @xmath94 while molecules in a mobile region ( orange ) show a fast increase in size ( inset).,width=302 ]    _ measurement of dynamical heterogenity _ - one way to measure the anomalous diffusion as a glass feature is to consider a subensemble of polar molecules in a small spatial region ( _ marker molecules _ ) , which are addressed with a laser and transferred to another internal ( e.g.  hyperfine ) state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the position of this molecular cloud at a later time can be measured with optical techniques . </S>",
    "<S> the ultimate tool for such position measurements will be provided by the quantum gas microscope for molecules , which - following the atomic case - will provide single site / single molecule detection with a resolution of the single site of an optical lattice @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> dynamical heterogeneity can then be measured as follows : we mark molecules in the crystal layer a in a small region with laser waist - size @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> after the system evolves in time , the positions of the _ marker molecules _ is measured , and the extension of the cloud of marker molecules is given by the radius of gyration @xmath96 . in a liquid a cloud of tagged particles spreads out linearly with time while in an amorphous solid it is constant @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> most important , in a liquid and crystal , the dynamics is independent of the initial position of the makers molecules as the dynamics is spatially homogeneous . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the glass phase due to dynamical heterogeneity the scaling differs significantly depending on the initial position ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : marker ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> as the initial size is @xmath98 from the laser waist , a series of single ( destructive ) measurements after time @xmath99 allows one to distinguish a glass from liquid or amorphous solid ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : marker ] ) . note that the marker molecules are quantum mechanically distinguishable which changes the dynamics in the deep quantum regime when exchange statistics is included , which is not relevant in the present case .    in conclusion , we have shown that a bilayer system of polar molecules can , with properly chosen parameters , exhibit a glass phase in a regime where quantum fluctuations are of the order of thermal fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> thus ultracold ensembles of polar molecules could provide a widely tunable paradigmic model system for classical and quantum glass physics , where theory and experiment can meet in a yet unexplored parameter regime of glass physics , providing in particular a stimulus for the theoretical developments .    </S>",
