    "topological insulators ( tis ) have recently attacted a lot of interest in the condensed matter physics community due to its fundamental novelty and potential application@xcite . unlike normal insulators ,",
    "tis possess gapless modes with linear dirac dispersion at the edge or surface as a direct physical consequence of the bulk topology and the time reversal symmetry .",
    "tis have been realized in both two dimension , such as hgte quantum wells@xcite , and three dimension , including bi@xmath0sb@xmath1@xcite , bi@xmath2se@xmath3 family@xcite and tlbise@xmath2 family@xcite . within the non - interacting band theory ,",
    "it is proposed that the tis can be further classified into two classes@xcite , one is the strong ti , which possesses odd number of dirac cones at the surface and has been realized in experiment as mentioned above , while the other one is the so - called weak ti , which has even number of dirac cones .",
    "the weak ti is topologically equivalent to a stack of two dimensional ti ( quantum spin hall insulator ) and is unstable against the translation breaking term@xcite .",
    "it is also proposed that one dimensional helical liquid can exist along the dislocation line of the lattice in a weak ti , which is believed to be protected by time reversal and stable against the weak disorder@xcite . recently , it is predicted that weak ti surface states are stable under time - reversal - invariant disorder@xcite .    in the presence of interactions",
    ", the strong ti can be defined in terms of the topological field theory@xcite with a quantized axion angle of @xmath4 .",
    "since the bulk axion topological term can be expressed in terms of the chern - simons term on the surface , the axion angle of @xmath4 implies a  half quantum hall effect \" on the surface , when time reversal symmetry is broken on the surface but preserved in the bulk .",
    "the half quantum hall effect is responsible for the topological magneto - electric effect of the strong ti@xcite .",
    "the time reversal symmetry breaking on the surface can be realized by ising type magnetic moments oriented along the surface normal .",
    "a single chiral mode exists on the domain wall of the magnetic moments .",
    "strong ti can be generally defined this way as long as the time reversal symmetry is present inside the bulk , without specific reference to the translational symmetry of the lattice and the periodic band structure . however , weak ti is not generally robust when only time reversal symmetry is present in the bulk , in fact we shall show that it is possible to open up a gap on the surface without breaking the time reversal symmetry . therefore , lattice translation symmetry must also be imposed in the bulk for the weak ti to be topologically well defined . in this case , it is natural to ask what is the physical effect associated with breaking the translational symmetry on the surface of a weak ti . in this paper , we investigate interaction effects in weak ti by first writing a minimal four band model for weak tis . then we show that the weak ti phase , possessing two dirac cones at the @xmath5 and @xmath6 of the surface brillioun zone respectively , can be obtained by properly tuning the parameters of the four band model .",
    "the surface staggered potential ( @xmath7 charge density wave ) can induce the scattering between the two dirac cones and gap the surface states without breaking time reversal symmetry .",
    "interestingly , a helical liquid , identical to the edge states of the 2d topological quantum spin hall insulator@xcite , emerges at the domain wall for the staggered potential .",
    "consequently , the gaped surface state of weak ti can be regarded as a half quantum spin hall state , in analogy to the half quantum hall state for the gaped surface state of strong topological insulators .",
    "we propose such a  half quantum spin hall effect \" as a robust defining feature of weak ti .",
    "since the quantum spin hall state is stable upon electron interaction , so is the half quantum spin hall effect .",
    "as long as the translation symmetry in the bulk is preserved , the weak ti is a well - defined topological state defined by the helical liquid on the domain wall of a surface cdw order . to find the condition for the surface cdw order",
    ", we further investigate the effect of repulsive interaction for the surface states of weak tis .",
    "our results show that the surface cdw state with half quantum spin hall effect is realized when nearest neighbor repulsion dominates the on - site repulsion , while a ferromagnetic quantum anomalous hall state is induced in the opposite limit .",
    "we find the surprising result that the antiferromagnetic order is not favored by the on - site repulsion on the surface of a weak ti , in sharp contrast to conventional 2d systems .",
    "the four band model introduced by zhang _",
    "et al _ has been successfully used to describe the strong topological insulator of bi@xmath2se@xmath3 family of materials@xcite . for simplicity",

    "this hamiltonian satisfies time reversal symmetry @xmath68 with @xmath69 and @xmath70 complex conjugation .    the next question is which kind of scattering can open a gap for the surface states without breaking time reversal . with a single dirac cone",
    ", it is found that the two components are related to each other by time reversal symmetry , therefore it is not possible to open a gap without breaking time reversal by the scattering within a single dirac cone .",
    "consequently , we need to consider the scattering between two dirac cones , as shown in fig [ fig : halfqsh ] ( b ) .",
    "the only mass term which can gap both dirac cones while preserving time reversal symmetry is @xmath71 to identify the physical meaning of @xmath72 , we can re - write this term in the lattice model and obtain the form @xmath73 , which is nothing but the staggered potential ( or @xmath7 charge density wave ) at the surface . the staggered potential breaks translation symmetry , enlarges the lattice unit - cell and reduces the surface bz . in the new surface",

    "recently , several papers@xcite discuss the disorder effect of the weak ti and show that the weak ti is robust against the time reversal invariant disorder .",

    "the disorder will pin different cdw domains around different spatial points , leading to random cdw domain walls on the surface .",
    "there is a pair of helical edge states propagating along each domain wall . with random impurities , the area of the two types of cdw domains are always equal on average , so that the edge channels are always conducting due to percolation .    finally",

    "the only known material exhibiting non - trivial weak ti index is bi@xmath0sb@xmath1 alloy@xcite , which also has non - trivial strong ti index .",
    "consequently , if a charge density wave order is introduced on the surface of bi@xmath0sb@xmath1 , the surface will become a half quantum spin hall state coexisting with an additional massless dirac cone from the strong ti index .",
    "the weak ti phase is also proposed recently for the 1/6 and 2/3 filling fractions in the octahedron - decorated cubic lattice@xcite .",
    "search for new weak ti materials will be another interesting question for the future research .",
