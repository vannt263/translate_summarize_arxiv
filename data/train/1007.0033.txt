    "the notion of bialgebras and hopf algebras in braided categories were introduced by s. majid in @xcite .",
    "he has considered a braided monoidal ( tensor ) category and in the usual definitions of algebras , coalgebras , bialgebras and hopf algebras , he has replaced the flip by the braiding in the obvious way .",
    "majid has called braided bialgebra to a bialgebra in a braided category .",
    "refer to @xcite and @xcite for generalities in braided monoidal categories and to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for the definition and results in the theory of braided bialgebras and braided hopf algebras .",
    "+ the purpose of this paper is to present a construction in which starting from a small braided monoidal ab - category @xmath0 and an infinite set @xmath1 we create a new monoidal braided category @xmath2 that contains the original @xmath0 as a subcategory , and more important , it contains objects with bialgebra structure , in such a way that the objects of the original category @xmath0 are modules for these bialgebras .",
    "remember that a category @xmath0 is said to be an ab - category ( also called _ pre - abelian _ category ; cf.@xcite ) if for any pair of objects @xmath3 , @xmath4 its set of morphisms @xmath5 is an additive abelian group and the composition of morphisms is bilinear . in the context of monoidal ab - categories",
    "we shall assume that the tensor product of morphisms is bilinear .",
    "for the construction we proceed as follows .",
    "section [ seccion1 ] is divided into two parts ; in the first part , out of any small ab - category @xmath0 and any set @xmath1 , we construct the new category @xmath2 which is also an ab - category .",
    "in the second part we assume that @xmath0 is strict monoidal and that @xmath1 is infinite , and so , we extend the monoidal structure to @xmath2 . however , the extended monoidal structure is not strict , so we have to work with associative constraints , and left and right units . in the second part",
    "we show how to extend a braiding and a twist from @xmath0 to @xmath2 .",
    "since the new category is nonstrict monoidal , we need to define algebras , coalgebras , bialgebras and modules in this case .",
    "this is easily made if in the categorical definitions of the latter notions we substitute the equalities by an equivalent relation in the set of morphisms of @xmath2 .",
    "roughly speaking , we declare two morphisms of @xmath2 related if their domains and codomains are related by associativity and/or units .",
    "this relation , obviously , agree with the identity if the category is stric ; this is explained in detail at the end of section [ seccion1 ] .",
    "we start section [ section2 ] defining algebras , coalgebras , bialgebras and modules in nonstric monoidal categories in general , and then state and prove the main theorem ( theorem [ principal ] ) of this paper . throughout the proof we use graphical calculus as explained in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "let @xmath6 be a small ab - category .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath7 and @xmath8 the sets of its objects and morphisms , respectively .",
    "we are going to associate to @xmath6 a new category @xmath9 as follows .",
    "let us take a fixed set @xmath10 and consider the set @xmath11 ^ -{f } & { \\mathrm{obj}}({\\mathcal{c}})}\\}$ ] , where @xmath12 is any subset of @xmath1 and @xmath13 is a set - theoretical function .",

    "therefore @xmath34 also satisfies condition ( ii ) .    for any @xmath15 define @xmath41 as the function @xmath42 , given by @xmath43 for @xmath44 . for @xmath45 one",

    "if for two morphisms @xmath51 we define the function @xmath52 , which trivially satisfies conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) , we see that @xmath2 is also an ab - category .",
    "the following proposition proves that the direct sum of certain collections of objects in @xmath2 is defined .",
    "let @xmath53 be any collection of functions such that the sets @xmath54 , @xmath55 , are pairwise disjoint subsets of @xmath1 .",
    "then @xmath56 , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 is given by @xmath59 , is the coproduct of @xmath53 in @xmath9 .",
