    "exciton condensation is one of the most interesting phenomena in strongly correlated electron systems and it has been extensively studied since 1960s  @xcite .",
    "the exciton is a bound electron - hole pair mediated by the ( attractive ) coulomb interaction between them . when the binding energy of an exciton exceeds the energy gap between the electron and hole bands , the system has an instability towards condensation of excitons . despite the extensive studies for half a century ,",
    "the example of exciton condensation which is generally accepted is quite limited .",
    "one of the reasons is that the exciton is a neutral quasiparticle and difficult to be detected in experiments .",
    "therefore , any conclusive evidence for exciton condensation in real materials is essential for further progress .    among the limited candidates , the transition metal dichalcogenide of tise@xmath1 is one of the most notable materials for exciton condensation .",
    "it shows a commensurate cdw transition at @xmath2200k with small structural distortion but the fermi surface partially remains due to the imperfect opening of the energy gap .",
    "the origin of the cdw transition is still controversial and one of the possible mechanisms is exciton condensation  @xcite .",
    "the observed flat band structure just below the fermi energy  @xcite is characteristic of exciton condensation , although it is not a direct evidence .",
    "another possible mechanism for the cdw transition is a jahn - teller effect which results from the electron - phonon interaction  @xcite .",
    "recently , it is proposed that both mechanisms work cooperatively for the cdw state  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the cdw phase , tise@xmath1 exhibits superconductivity with dome - shaped transition temperature induced by intercalating cu atoms between layers  @xcite or by applying pressure  @xcite . the origin of the superconductivity has not been clarified yet and the relation between the cdw and the superconductivity has attracted much interests in the context of the quantum critical point .",
    "most of the theoretical studies for exciton condensation are limited to an ideal case , e.g. , considering models in one dimensional , ignoring an intraband coulomb interaction , a long - range coulomb interaction , and a spin degrees of freedom .",
    "although these models are useful to describe exciton condensation alone , it is generally difficult to discuss the competition between other competing phases such as magnetism and superconductivity due to the lack of realistic condition .",
    "our aim is to establish a calculation scheme which can describe such a competition and to clarify the emerging mechanism of exciton condensation and superconductivity in low carrier density systems such as tise@xmath1 .",
    "the variational monte carlo ( vmc ) method is one of the powerful methods for a strongly correlated electron systems and is suitable to this kind of problem . in this paper",
    ", we study a two - band hubbard model with intra- and interband coulomb interactions to investigate the detailed character of exciton condensation .",
    "the vmc method is used for the calculation of physical quantities in the ground state .",
    "we show that the phase transition from an excitonic insulator to a band insulator is induced by increasing the interband interaction .",
    "the importance of the intraband interaction is also discussed .",
    "furthermore , the bcs - bec crossover within the excitonic insulator is studied by calculating the exciton pair amplitudes both in @xmath0-space and in real space .",
    "we consider a two - band hubbard model on a two - dimensional square lattice defined by the following hamiltonian , @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the creation operator of an electron with wave vector @xmath0 and spin @xmath5 on band @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 is an intraband coulomb interaction and @xmath8 is an interband coulomb interaction between bands @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 denotes the number operator and @xmath12 .",
    "we set the non - interacting band energy as @xmath13 and @xmath14 . the fermi surface and the energy dispersion",
    "are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1](a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "the electron and hole fermi surfaces are perfectly nested with wave vector @xmath15 and have instability towards exciton condensation .    here",
    ", we introduce the following gutzwiller - jastrow type trial wave function : @xmath16 the one - body part @xmath17 is obtained by diagonalizing the mean - field hamiltonian , @xmath18 since we fix @xmath19 as an energy unit , @xmath20 is unchanged through the vmc calculation . on the other hand , @xmath21 and @xmath22 in @xmath23",
    "are optimized so as to minimize the variational energy .",
    "@xmath24 is a variational parameter for the exciton condensation and generates the spontaneous hybridization between bands @xmath9 and @xmath10 with wave vector @xmath15 .",
    "although there are several types of exciton condensation depending on charge and spin degrees of freedom , they are energetically degenerate for the hamiltonian without spin - dependent interactions such as hund s coupling .",
    "therefore , we assume a spin - independent variational parameter as follows , @xmath25.\\ ] ] @xmath26 is an amplitude of the variational parameter and @xmath27 controls the extent of exciton in @xmath0-space .",
    "we have found that the exciton condensation can be described without @xmath27 ( i.e. , @xmath28 ) but the introduction of @xmath27 greatly improves the variational energy and gives a better trial wave function .",
    "the gutzwiller operator @xmath29 \\label{go}\\ ] ] in @xmath30 is the one extended for the two - band system .",
    "@xmath31 is a site index and @xmath32 represents possible electron configurations at each site , namely , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "the variational parameters @xmath37 s vary from 0 to 1 , which control the weight of each electron configuration . here",
    ", we classify the possible 16 local electron configurations into 10 groups by the local energy and set the same value of @xmath37 s for electron configurations with the same energy .",
    "the explicit grouping is shown elsewhere .",
    "the remaining operator @xmath38\\ ] ] in @xmath39 is the charge jastrow factor , which controls the long - range charge correlations .",
    "since the on - site coulomb interactions @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath8 affect not only the on - site but also the off - site ( long - range ) charge correlation , the charge jastrow factor is essential for describing the appropriate trial wave function  @xcite . the band dependence is fully considered , namely , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 are independently optimized . for the spatial dependence ,",
    "we assume that @xmath45 depends only on the distances ( not on the direction ) , @xmath46 , and consider the range of @xmath47 for a square lattice of @xmath48 .",
    "these variational parameters , @xmath49 are simultaneously optimized so as to minimize the variational energy . for the optimization , we employ the stochastic reconfiguration method  @xcite which works quite effectively for the vmc method .    .",

    "[ fig1](a ) , an infinitesimally small @xmath8 induces the exciton condensation and the system becomes fully gapped .",
    "this phase is called excitonic insulator which has been extensively studied so far . as for the trial wave function",
    ", we have confirmed that the charge jastrow factor @xmath57 is quite important for the stability of exiton condensation through lowering the variational energy of excitonic insulator phase .",
    "this is because the exciton pair has nonnegligible long - range component ( at least several lattice constant ) even with on - site coulomb interaction alone .",
    "the details are discussed later in fig .",
    "when @xmath8 increases further , the bands @xmath9 and @xmath10 are completely decoupled and the band insulator is realized . in the band insulator phase ,",
    "the band @xmath9 is fully filled ( @xmath58 ) and the band @xmath10 is empty ( @xmath59 ) to avoid the energy loss of @xmath8 despite the energy loss of @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , the region of the excitonic insulator becomes larger as @xmath40 increases  @xcite .",
    "this phase diagram is consistent with the previous variational cluster approximation ( vca ) study both qualitatively and quantitatively  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the excitonic insulator phase is restricted to a quite narrow region when the intraband interaction is absent ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "this indicates the importance of the intraband interaction to stabilize the exciton condensation . since most of the previous studies for exciton condensation neglect the intraband coulomb interactions , its stability might be underestimated .",

    "[ fig2](b ) , the peak structure is rather broad for @xmath63 and it indicates a tightly bounded electron - hole pair in real space . the effective fermi wave vector is smaller than the original one , @xmath75 , and the effective energy gap is larger than the original one , @xmath76 . the @xmath8 dependence of @xmath66 is shown in fig .  [ fig2](c ) and this behavior is explained as follows .",
    "the character of the exciton condensation is determined by the balance between intra-(@xmath40 ) and interband ( @xmath8 ) interactions . when the effect of @xmath40 is dominant ( @xmath77 4.8 ) ,",
    "the effective energy gap is renormalized to a smaller value , @xmath78 , to decrease @xmath79 and avoid the loss of @xmath40 .",
    "as @xmath8 increases for fixed @xmath40 , @xmath66 increases and exceeds the original value around @xmath80 . for @xmath81 ,",
    "the effect of @xmath8 is dominant and the effective energy gap is renormalized to a larger value , @xmath82 , to decrease @xmath83 and avoid the loss of @xmath8 . finally , the bands @xmath9 and @xmath10 are completely decoupled and the band insulator is realized for @xmath84 .",
    "note that we can not observe the limit of the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of excitons where the effective fermi wave vector @xmath85 vanishes , namely , @xmath86 ( no overlap between the bands @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) and @xmath87 .",
    "however , the behavior of the variational parameters drastically changes across @xmath80 and we expect that there is a bcs - bec crossover around this @xmath65 . in the vca study ,",
    "the bcs - bec crossover occurs around @xmath88 and the vanishing of @xmath85 is observed at @xmath89  @xcite .",
    "although the vmc study depends on the form of trial wave functions used , it can treat large enough system sizes , as large as @xmath90 , to describe the bound electron - hole pair of exciton at least in the bec region .",
    "the electron correlation is exactly treated within a 2@xmath522 cluster in the vca , but our results suggest that the cluster size dependence should be carefully considered .",
    "the difference between the vmc and vca results should be clarified to further understand the bcs - bec crossover and it is precisely our future problem .     and @xmath91 for ( a ) @xmath62 and ( b ) @xmath63 at @xmath68 ( same with fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "[ fig3 ] ]    next , to examine the character of exciton in real space , we calculate the electron - hole pair amplitude @xmath92 defined as @xmath93 although in general @xmath92 depends not only on the distance between @xmath94 and @xmath95 , @xmath96 , but also on the direction between @xmath94 and @xmath95 , we have found that the direction dependence of @xmath92 is small at least for parameters studied here .",
    "therefore , we assume @xmath97 in the following .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the behavior of @xmath98 for @xmath68 . for @xmath62 (",
    "expected to be bcs type ) , @xmath98 gradually decreases with increasing @xmath99 and exhibits oscillatory behavior .",
    "a similar oscillatory behavior can be observed in the electron - electron pair amplitude @xmath100 of the bcs superconductivity , which is proportional to @xmath101 .",
    "this is because the wave function of exciton condensation is composed of a coherent electron - hole pair and essentially identical to that of the bcs superconductivity with a coherent electron - electron pair  @xcite . on the other hand , for @xmath63 (",
    "expected to be bec type ) , in the vicinity of the phase boundary between the excitonic and band insulators , @xmath98 decreases more rapidly and the oscillatory behavior is hardly observed . as @xmath8 increases , the attraction between electron and hole increases and the radius of exciton becomes smaller in real space .",
    "these behaviors are consistent with the @xmath0-space picture : a widely - extended ( tightly - bounded ) exciton in real space corresponds to a localized ( an extended ) exciton in @xmath0-space .",
    "finaly , we calculate the coherence length of electron - hole pair defined as @xmath102 the coherence length is often used to distinguish the bcs region ( @xmath103 , weak coupling ) from the bec region ( @xmath104 , strong coupling ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we plot the quantity @xmath91 appearing in eq.([coh ] ) . for @xmath63 ,",
    "this quantity is almost negligible for @xmath105 , indicating that the system size ( @xmath90 ) is large enough to describe the bound electron - hople pair of exciton .",
    "the estimated coherence length @xmath106 is 0.77 . on the other hand , for @xmath62",
    ", @xmath91 gradually decreases with increasing @xmath99 , showing oscillatory behavior , and has significant contribution for rather large @xmath99 .",
    "we have also found that the size dependence of the calculation becomes severe around this @xmath65 and below .",
    "this indicates that there is a bcs - bec crossover around this @xmath65 , below which the coherence length rapidly increases in the bcs region where even @xmath90 is not large enough to estimate @xmath106 .",
    "although it is difficult to discuss the bcs - bec crossover with @xmath98 and @xmath106 shown here , we can visualize the spatial distribution of exciton using these quantities , which helps for further understanding the exciton condensation .",
    "the accurate estimation of @xmath106 and other physical quantities in real space is an important future problem .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the two - band hubbard model with perfectly nested electron and hole fermi surfaces to discuss the stability of the exciton condensation with changing the coulomb interactions .",
    "we have shown that the phase transition from an excitonic insulator to a band insulator occurs by increasing @xmath8 and the region of the excitonic insulator is extended for larger @xmath40 .",
    "we have also calculated the exciton pair amplitude both in @xmath0-space and in real space and proposed that the bcs - bec crossover occurs around @xmath80 for @xmath107 .",
    "the extension of the vmc study for more realistic models is straightforward .",
    "we have checked that the introduction of a long - range coulomb interaction greatly extends the region of the excitonic insulator phase in the phase diagram  @xcite .",
    "this is because the long - range coulomb interaction enhances the long - range exciton pairs and leads to a more stable excitonic insulator phase .",
    "in such a case , the charge jastrow factor @xmath57 becomes more important because the screening effect of long - range coulomb interaction , which is an essential element for the exciton condensation , will be properly included through @xmath57 . on the other hand ,",
    "the exciton condensation is greatly suppressed when the perfect nesting condition is broken  @xcite . understanding the effect of the long - range coulomb interaction and imperfect nesting on the stability of the exciton condensation and other competing phases such as",
