    "it is generally believed that the ionization fraction in interstellar clouds is sufficiently high for flux - freezing to apply , and that interstellar magnetic fields are thus well coupled to the gas .",
    "furthermore , the fields may be strong enough to be dynamically important , and thus may play important roles in star formation .",
    "these issues have been reviewed by crutcher ( 2004 ) .",
    "furthermore , as reviewed by mac low &  klessen ( 2004 ) , magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence is probably an important player in the star formation process .",
    "submillimeter polarimetry is a technique for mapping interstellar magnetic fields ( lazarian 2000 ) that is well suited for studying dense star forming clouds . in particular",
    ", this method appears to have an advantage over the related technique of optical / near - ir polarimetry of background stars .",
    "specifically , it has been shown by whittet et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and arce et al .",
    "( 1998 ) that grain populations residing in regions that are shielded from the interstellar radiation field have very low polarizing efficiency at optical / near - ir wavelengths .",
    "moderate shielding ( @xmath1 mag ) seems to be sufficient to sharply reduce the efficiency .",
    "by contrast , when we study the submillimeter emission from highly obscured regions ( @xmath2 @xmath3  30 mag ) in a dense cloud , we find significant polarization ( crutcher et al .  2004 ) .",
    "thus , submillimeter polarimetry is especially useful for such regions .",
    "this discrepancy between optical / near - ir polarization efficiency and submillimeter efficiency , for highly obscured regions , is explained by cho and lazarian ( 2005 ) as an effect of grain size . under the assumption that grains are aligned by the radiative torque mechanism ( dolginov 1972 , draine &  weingartner 1996 , 1997 )",
    ", they show that in highly obscured regions only the largest grains will be aligned .",
    "they argue that these large aligned grains dominate the submillimeter emission but are relatively less important for the optical / near - ir extinction .",
    "maps of submillimeter / far - ir polarization usually cover relatively small sky areas ; typically of order ten square arcminutes ( greaves et al .",
    "2003 , hildebrand 2002 , dotson et al .",
    "because giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) usually extend over much larger sky areas , approaching a square degree , these small - scale maps have not been very useful for probing the large - scale , or global , magnetic field of a gmc .",
    "not every submillimeter polarization map is small on the sky , however : the archeops balloon - borne submillimeter polarimeter ( benot et al . 2004 ) mapped the degree - scale submillimeter ( 850 ) polarization of large sections of the galactic disk .",
    "binning their data to a resolution of several degrees , they obtain significant detections of polarization with magnetic field directions generally running parallel to the galactic plane .",
    "because the large - scale galactic magnetic field determined from optical polarimetry is also known to run parallel to the plane ( mathewson &  ford 1970 ) , the archeops result shows that the galactic field penetrates into the dense gas that dominates the submillimeter emission .",
    "in contrast , the smaller scale far - ir / submillimeter polarization maps of gmcs in the disk show a wide range of inferred field directions and no preferred orientation with respect to the galactic plane ( see fig .",
    "21 of hildebrand 2002 ) .",
    "the south pole polarimeter sparo is optimized for submillimeter polarimetry on angular scales larger than those typically accessible from ground - based submillimeter dishes , though not as large as those studied by archeops .  with sparo",
    "we can map fields over a significant fraction a gmc while still resolving field structure within the cloud . here",
    "we present sparo polarization maps for four gmcs in the galactic disk .",
    "each map extends over a sky area corresponding to several hundreds of square arcminutes .",
    "the observations were made at amundsen - scott south pole station , using the viper telescope ( peterson et al .",
    "2000 , kuo et al .  2004 ) together with northwestern university s submillimeter polarimeter , sparo ( dotson et al .",
    "1998 , renbarger et al .  2004 ) .",
    "radiation entering sparo passes through a rotatable half - wave plate , and is then divided into two orthogonal polarization components , each of which is detected by a separate @xmath4he - cooled 9-pixel detector array .",
    "sparo thus measures polarization simultaneously at nine sky positions , arranged in a 3 by 3 square pattern .",
    "because the south pole is an exceptionally good submillimeter site lane ( 1998 ) , sparo obtains extremely good sensitivity to spatially extended , low surface - brightness emission .",
    "sparo s first observations , made during austral winter 2000 , were reported by novak et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . here",
    "we present results from our second observing campaign that took place during april ",
    "august 2003 .    for the 2003 observations , the beam fwhm was determined to be 4@xmath5 0.5 , and the pixel - to - pixel separation was 3.3 .",
    "the pointing accuracy was @xmath5 1 .",
    "sparo s spectral passband is centered at @xmath6 450 , with fractional bandwidth @xmath7 0.10 .",
    "our data acquisition scheme involves carrying out standard `` photometric integrations '' at each of six half - wave plate rotation angles , successively ( hildebrand et al .",
    "each photometric integration , in turn , involves rapidly switching the array footprint back and forth on the sky between the source position and a reference position .",
    "reference signals are subtracted from source signals .",
    "we used two reference positions ( hildebrand et al .",
    "2000 ) , separated from the source position by + 0.65  and @xmath80.65  in cross - elevation , respectively .",
    "our data reduction procedures follow closely those described by hildebrand et al .",
    "( 2000 ) with one important difference .",
    "hildebrand et al .",
    "( 2000 ) describes how the `` polarization signal '' is computed from each photometric integration ( see above ) by taking the difference between signals from corresponding pixels of the two detector arrays , and then dividing this by the sum of these signals ( see their equation 7 ) .",
    "this corresponds to dividing polarized flux by total flux .",
    "we found that for our observations the total flux was often not well determined by a single photometric integration , due to variations in atmospheric emission significantly above the level of the photon noise .",
    "these variations are usually referred to as `` sky noise '' , and they affect the total flux measurement but not the difference signals . in order to circumvent the problem , we developed a new method for computing the polarization signal , which we now describe .",
    "we grouped our data into `` sets '' consisting of nine identical `` half - wave plate cycles '' .",
    "as described above , each such cycle involved six photometric integrations , each taken at a different half - wave plate angle .",
    "for each set , we computed a single value for the total flux , or signal sum , for each of the nine pixels .",
    "we also computed , for each pixel , six values of the difference signal , one for each half - wave plate position .",
    "these six difference signals were then divided by the set - average total flux for the corresponding pixel .",
    "our new technique for determining the polarization signal requires stable atmospheric transmission over time scales one hour , corresponding to the duration of one set . on the basis of opacity measurements obtained with the cmu / nrao tipper ( peterson et al .",
    "2003 ) , we estimate that signals were stable to @xmath5 10% .",
    "a more detailed description of the new data analysis procedure is given by li et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , and a similar procedure that was applied to data from the hertz polarimeter is described by kirby et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "the instrumental polarization was determined by calibrating on the moon and on the intensity peak of sgr b2 , following the same procedure that we used for our 2000 observations ( novak et al .",
    "2003 , chuss 2002 ) .",
    "the level of systematic error in our measurements is @xmath9 0.3% , which translates into an uncertainty in polarization angle of @xmath10 .",
    "we observed four gmcs : ngc 6334 , the carina nebula , g333.6 - 0.2 , and g331.5 - 0.1 .",
    "three of our targets were chosen for their high column density and large angular extent as determined from the dust opacity map of schlegel et al .",
    "this map is derived by combining cobe / dirbe and iras / issa maps .",
    "one of our targets , carina , has somewhat lower dust opacity than the others .",
    "it was chosen for its high elevation ( @xmath11 at s.  pole ) which corresponds to higher atmospheric transmission . in tables 1  4 , we give the measured degree and angle of polarization and associated statistical errors for all sky positions having p @xmath12 .",
    "note that @xmath13 of the measurements have p @xmath14 .",
    "all measured degrees of polarization are larger than 0.3% , i.e.  they are above the level of systematic error .",
    "figure 1 shows the inferred magnetic field directions ( that are orthogonal to the measured polarization directions ) and the magnitudes of polarization ( denoted by the lengths of the bars ) superposed on iras 100  maps .",
    "in this section , we first give an overview of the characteristics of the four gmcs we observed (   3.1 ) .",
    "then we discuss the measured degrees of polarization (   3.2 ) . in the remaining four sections we deal with the inferred magnetic field directions , beginning with an overview of the statistics of these directions (   3.3 ) , next comparing with mid - ir intensity maps (   3.4 ) and with information obtained from optical polarimetry of stars (   3.5 ) , and finally discussing the relevance to theoretical ideas concerning formation and structure of gmcs (   3.6 ) .",
    "perhaps the best studied of our four targets is the carina nebula ( ngc 3372 ) , a very bright emission nebula excited by ob star clusters and lying at a distance of about 2.7 kpc (   3.1.5 ) in the carina spiral arm .",
    "optical nebulosity and mid - ir emission extend over @xmath15  in galactic latitude and @xmath16  in longitude ( smith et al . 2000 ) , but most of the far - ir and radio continuum flux is concentrated in the central @xmath17  region shown in figure 1 ( shaver & goss 1970 ; zhang et al .",

    "the bright central radio peak of the carina nebula consists of two main parts , carina i and carina ii ( davidson &  humphreys 1997 ; whiteoak 1994 ; brooks , storey , &  whiteoak 2001 ) , whose sky locations are indicated in figure 1 with filled and open star symbols , respectively .",
    "carina i ( a.k.a .  g287.4 - 0.6 ) is powered by the ob star cluster tr 14 , located a few arcminutes to the east of carina i.   carina ii ( a.k.a .",

    "there is little evidence for ongoing formation of massive stars within the region encompassed by tr 14 , tr 16 , carina i , and carina ii ( davidson &  humphreys 1997 ) , but evidence for ongoing star formation has been found surrounding this region , especially to the southeast of eta carinae ( megeath et al .",

    "several of these radio sources can be seen in figure 1 , and several others lie beyond the beyond the southern and western edges of the image .    not all the members of this group have the same line - of - sight velocity , so it is generally believed that the group is a superposition of two unrelated complexes ( russeil et al .",

    "except for g331.3 - 0.3 , all major flux peaks seen in figure 1 correspond to the -87 km / s complex .",
    "for the most part , sky locations where we obtained polarimetry data correspond to the -87 km / s complex .",
    "about seven vectors lying at the southeast corner of our polarization map are closer to g331.3 - 0.3 than to any source in the -87 km / s complex , so they probably correspond to the -65 km / s complex . note",
    "that many of these vectors are more nearly perpendicular to the galactic plane , while the vectors for the rest of the map are more nearly parallel to it .",

    ", it does seem that evidence for ongoing formation of massive stars has been found .",
    "for example , at the position of this source we find a massive ammonia core ( vilas - boas &  abraham 2000 ) , cs emission ( bronfman , nyman , &  may 1996 ) , and strong methanol maser emission ( walsh et al . 1997 ) .      all four sparo targets are associated with massive gmcs ( @xmath19 - @xmath23 @xmath20 ) and ongoing or recent formation of massive stars .",
    "using iras results as their database , kuiper et al .",
    "( 1987 ) did a comparative study of 65 of the brightest southern molecular clouds in the galaxy , including our four targets .",

    "g333.6 - 0.2 , and g331.5 - 0.1 , temperatures were in the range 40 - 43 k. these values are near the peak of the distribution for the 65 sources .",
    "for the carina nebula , a color temperature of 48 k was found .",
    "this value lies in the upper tail of the distribution .",
    "column densities for carina were significantly lower than for our other three targets .",
    "one explanation for these differences is that carina is more evolved than the others , so more gas has been dispersed and more energy has been released to heat the dust .",
    "this would be consistent with the observed fact that massive stars do not seem to be presently forming within the region corresponding to our polarimetric map of carina (   3.1.1 ) .      for purposes of comparing our results with optical polarimetry (   3.5 ) and estimating physical scales corresponding to the sparo beam size (   3.6 ) we require accurate estimates of the distances to our targets .",
    "distance determinations for these targets fall into two categories : stellar distance estimates ( e.g.  spectroscopic parallax ) and kinematic distance estimates , based on the galactic rotation curve .",
    "the latter solution is multi - valued , providing a `` near distance '' and a `` far distance '' . using the spectroscopic parallax method , neckel ( 1978 ) obtained distance estimates for ob stars presumed to be associated with ngc 6334 . on this basis , they derive a distance of ( @xmath26 ) kpc for this cloud .    the star clusters tr 16 and tr 14 that power the carina nebula are separated by about 15 pc on the sky .",
    "the maps in smith et al .",
    "( 2000 ) show that this nebula is reasonably isolated on the sky , so it seems likely that the two clusters lie at roughly the same distance .",

    "( 1999 ) , this effect could explain why sparo sees higher polarization . on the other hand , sparo s large beam averages over more field disorder , which would tend to reduce the polarization magnitude .",
    "another effect that could be important is our improved data analysis method (   2 ; li et al .",
    "2005 ) , that removes the bias toward low polarization magnitude .",
    "finally , note that vaillancourt ( 2002 ) present evidence for structure in the polarization spectrum , so the modest wavelength difference ( 350  vs.  450 ) could be important .",

    "the position angle is given in galactic coordinates , with 0corresponding to galactic north - south , and with position angle increasing in the counter - clockwise direction .",
    "note that the measurements tend to cluster near the dark vertical line at position angle 90 , corresponding to magnetic fields running parallel to the galactic plane .",
    "relatively few measurements are found near the left- and right - hand extremes of the histogram , corresponding to fields orthogonal to the plane .",
    "we can explain this by supposing that large - scale magnetic fields in gmcs are generally parallel to the even larger scale galactic fields in the regions surrounding these clouds , which are known to run preferentially parallel to the galactic plane ( mathewson &  ford 1970 ) .",
    "much of the remainder of this paper is devoted to exploring the validity of this conclusion , and its implications .    as a first step",

    "the method we use to calcuate this mean is described in the paragraphs below . for three of the four clouds ,",
    "the mean field direction is nearly parallel to the galactic plane , but for ngc 6334 the mean is almost perpendicular to the plane .    because the field direction measurements wrap around , with 0  = 180",
    ", the mean position angle is actually undefined .",
    "however , it is clear that each cloud has a well defined peak in the distribution of angles ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "we have devised a technique for estimating the position of this peak , based on the formalism of stokes parameters ( e.g. , see jackson 1999 ) .",
    "two of the four stokes parameters , q and u , contain information about the state of linear polarization of a light beam .",
    "they are related to the intensity of linearly polarized flux @xmath27 and angle of polarization @xmath28 via @xmath29    our method is as follows : for a given cloud , we first compute @xmath30 and @xmath31 for each sky position i where we have detected polarization . note that by summing these to form @xmath32 and @xmath33 , one can determine the polarization state that would be measured by an imaginary polarimeter that acts by combining all flux from the region studied by sparo and making one polarization measurement on it . however , since our goal is to study the global field of each cloud , we do not want regions having high column density to be given more weight than regions having low column density . furthermore , we do not want regions having high grain alignment efficiency to be given more weight than regions with low efficiency . accordingly , to ensure that each sky position will be given equal weight , we compute @xmath34 and then average all values of @xmath35 and @xmath36 for a given cloud to form @xmath37 and @xmath38 . from these `` equal weight '' average values we can derive a mean polarization angle for the cloud using the formalism in equation ( 1 ) .",
    "we refer to the mean magnetic field direction obtained in this way as the `` equal weight stokes mean '' , @xmath39 .",
    "note that because the total flux and degree of polarization cancel out in equation ( 2 ) , @xmath39 is actually determined using only the measured angles of polarization .",

    "the most likely explanation is the one we advanced in the first paragraph of this section : large - scale magnetic fields in gmcs are preferentially parallel to the fields in the even larger scale regions of the galaxy that surround these clouds .",

    "polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules ( pahs ) can be used as a tracer of massive star formation ( peeters 2004 ) .",

    "1999 ; peeters 2002 ) , which are determined by the ratio of the illuminating uv radiation field and the electron density , @xmath43 . in regions having high @xmath43 ratio the ionized states of pah dominate , while for low @xmath43 ratio it is the neutral states that are more common . in the ionized state ,",
    "the intensity of the 8  emission is much higher . in crossing the boundary of an hii  region",

    "the result is a sharp change in the 8  brightness at the boundary of an hii  .",
    "this effect can be seen in the 8  map of carina shown in figure 5 .",
    "the shapes of the bipolar hii  bubbles seen in this figure are very close to shapes seen in the superbubble simulations of silich &  franco ( 1999 ) .",
    "ob stars ionize their surroundings , and the ionization pressure wave propagates outwards from the star - forming region .",
    "the speed of propagation is inversely proportional to the density of the ambient interstellar medium , so hii  regions usually grow fastest along the direction perpendicular to the galactic plane .",
    "this explains the bipolar morphology of the hii  bubbles ( silich &  franco 1999 , smith et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "note that the magnetic field directions we determined for carina closely follow the boundaries of the two expanding hii  bubbles ( fig .  5 ) .",
    "this can be understood as the effect of the expansion of the bubble upon the magnetic field . in this model",
    ", we must assume that the expansion of the ionization front is accompanied by bulk gas motion , such that gas is generally flowing in a direction that points away from the center of the bubble .",
    "this is reasonable as the ionized gas will be heated and will tend to expand . in this case",
    "the gas just beyond the edge of each bubble will be compressed in a direction perpendicular to the bubble edge . under flux - freezing conditions ,",
    "such compression will have a strong effect on the magnetic field .",
    "the result will be that the field will tend to be parallel to the compression front ( e.g. , see novak et al .",
    "2000 ) , precisely as we observe in carina .",
    "however , there is an alternative explanation that could account for the observed parallelism between the edges of the bubble and the field without requiring a compression front . to see this , note",
    "that gas expansion , under flux - freezing conditions , will always cause distortions in the ambient magnetic field regardless of the existence or non - existence of a compression front external to the bubble .",
    "a concrete example is provided by the model of tomisaka ( 1998 ) where it is the magnetic tension rather than external gas pressure that acts to resist the expansion of the bubble .",
    "the bubble - like structures seen in carina are much more striking than the structures seen in the three other 8  maps shown in figure 5 .",
    "this may indicate that , in comparison with our other three targets , carina has suffered a relatively greater amount of disruption induced by star formation .",
    "if so , that would explain why carina shows more variation in inferred magnetic field direction in comparison with the other sparo targets ( fig .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with what we learned from the comparison between the four clouds (   3.1.4 ) .",
    "high - resolution radio polarization measurements of galaxies show that the magnetic field is well aligned with spiral arms ( neininger 1992 , neininger &  horellou 1996 , patrickeyev et al .",
    "2005 ) . because field disorder is magnified when observed along the field direction",
    ", one might argue that the lesser degree of uniformity of the fields in carina is a result of the near - coincidence of the line - of - sight and the tangent to the carina spiral arm at the location of the cloud ( the angle between line - of - sight and the arm tangent is @xmath3  20 , much lower than for ngc 6334 or g333.6 - 0.2 ) .",
    "however , the strong correlation between the fields and the bubble boundaries shows that the main reason for the field disorder is star formation .",
    "g333.6 - 0.2 also contains bipolar pah bubbles .",
    "these can be seen in the image shown in figure 5 , at position ( 0.10 , -0.05 ) and ( 0.0 , 0.05 ) .",
    "they are much easier to see in the recently obtained spitzer / glimpse images ( b.  whitney , private communication ) .",
    "in contrast to the case of carina , our polarization map for g333.6 - 0.2 covers a region significantly larger than the area containing the bubbles .",
    "the field in g333.6 - 0.2 is basically uniform , but note that the field lines running near the `` galactic north '' edge of the northern bubble appear to be pushed outwards by the bubble .",
    "ngc 6334 also shows bubble - like structures in figure 5 , but the strongest such structures occur at locations for which we have no sparo polarization data .",
    "it has been shown that galactic magnetic fields tend to be parallel to the galactic disk on large scales .",
    "for example , optical polarization measurements for stars more distant than 2 kpc show inferred field directions that are mostly parallel to the plane ( mathewson & ford 1970 ) . as discussed in   3.3 , our observations suggest that on the scales of our sparo polarization maps ( much smaller than 1 kpc ) , this tendency is still evident .",
    "this can be understood if the processes that act to accumulate diffuse gas and thereby form a gmc do not significantly alter the mean magnetic field direction in the gas .",
    "but in this case , how do we account for the outlier ngc 6334 ?",
    "one answer to this question is suggested by the fact that even though the large - scale galactic field is parallel to the disk , there are nevertheless spatial fluctuations in the galactic field that occur on scales that are larger than the size of a gmc ( e.g. , mathewson &  ford 1970 ) .",
    "if ngc 6334 happened to form in a region where such fluctuations had resulted in a field significantly different from the large - scale average , then this could explain the discrepancy .    in principle , this idea can be tested by comparing sparo results for each cloud with the field direction in the surrounding diffuse medium as sampled by optical polarimetry of stars . in practice",
    ", we have only been able to do this for ngc 6334 , the closest of our four targets .",
    "here we describe the results of this analysis , that was carried out using a stellar polarimetry database published by heiles ( 2000 ) .",
    "since this database was created by combining many previous polarization catalogs , it is referred to by the author as an `` agglomeration '' .",
    "when computing the field direction in the surrounding diffuse medium , we must choose a length scale to characterize this larger region .",
    "the natural choice is the accumulation length , defined so that the cube of this length corresponds to the volume of diffuse ism containing a gas mass equal to the mass of a gmc .",
    "williams et al .",
    "( 2000 ) estimate an accumulation length of 400 pc for the galactic disk .",
    "a stellar polarization measurement gives the mean field direction , weighted by density of dust particles , along the line of sight . to determine the field in a particular region",
    ", one must subtract the foreground polarization , inferred from foreground stars , from that measured for background stars ( e.g. , marraco et al .  1993 ) . in our analysis of the heiles ( 2000 )",
    "database , we carry out such subtractions .",
    "stellar distance measurements are important because we will rely on them to define the foreground and background stars for a given region . based on comparisons among the various catalogs that he has agglomerated , heiles ( 2000 ) estimates a typical distance uncertainty of about 20% .",
    "besides stellar distance , another factor that is relevant to the problem of foreground - effect subtraction is extinction . for the heiles ( 2000 )",
    "database , figure 6 shows how the selective extinction , e(b - v ) , varies with distance .",
    "each point represents the mean e(b - v ) for stars within a 100 pc distance interval . in making this figure ,",
    "we have included only stars having @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the galactic latitude .",
    "the figure shows that the selective extinction grows quite linearly up to @xmath48 kpc , with a slope close to the 0.6 mag / kpc value given by spitzer ( 1978 ) . beyond this distance",
    ", the extinction tends to level off .",
    "there are three effects that could contribute to this flattening of the extinction curve : ( 1 ) there is more dust nearer to the sun than further from it ( i.e. , we live within a local density enhancement ) .",
    "( 2 ) the data base contains malmquist bias .",
    "this refers to the fact that in a flux - limited sample , observers preferentially see atypically bright objects at larger distances .",
    "two factors that affect brightness are luminosity and extinction . from the point of view of this discussion",
    ", the latter possibility is interesting , because if there is a bias toward lower extinction at large distance then this can explain the flattening of the extinction curve .",
    "( 3 ) for a fixed latitude , sight - lines to more distant stars extend to higher distances above galactic plane , where there is less dust .",
    "because we have restricted b to @xmath49 , we can be reasonably sure that explanation ( 3 ) does not play a large role .",
    "this is because no sight line in our sample extends further than 10 pc from the galactic plane , for distances up to 3 kpc .",
    "10 pc is much smaller than the scale height of the hi  gas ( spitzer 1978 ) . given that the dust density should be highest at the location of the spiral arms , and that the sun is situated about half - way between two such arms , each about 2 kpc distant ( xu et al .",
    "2006 ) , it seems highly unlikely that explanation ( 1 ) could account for all of the flattening seen in figure 6 .",
    "thus , explantion ( 2 ) must play a significant role .",
    "malmquist bias can introduce uncertainties in the correction for foreground polarization .",
    "for this reason , we believe that using the data of heiles ( 2000 ) to study regions much beyond 1.5 kpc will give unreliable results .",
    "we have chosen to study regions as far as 1.7 kpc so that we can include the vicinity of ngc 6334 ( d = 1.7 kpc ; ",
    "the next closest source , carina , lies at a distance of 2.7 kpc , well into the flat part of the extinction curve . in   3.5.4 , we show that malmquist bias does not affect our main conclusions for regions as far as 1.7 kpc .",
    "in our analysis of the heiles ( 2000 ) database , we divide the nearby ( @xmath50 kpc ) regions of the galactic plane into `` cells '' with dimensions roughly corresponding to the accumulation length ( @xmath51 pc ; second paragraph of ",
    "one such cell is centered on ngc 6334 .",
    "for each cell , we collect data from heiles ( 2000 ) and apply a correction for foreground polarization in order to estimate the mean magnetic field direction within each cell . for the ngc 6334 cell , we compare this result with the mean field direction inferred from the sparo data .",
    "the other cells serve as comparison regions .",
    "our cells are cuboids in ( @xmath52 , @xmath47 , @xmath53)-space , where @xmath52 and @xmath47 are galactic longitude and latitude and @xmath53 is distance from the sun .",
    "all cells are centered on @xmath54 , and centered on one of three possible values of @xmath53 : 0.7 kpc , 1.2 kpc , and 1.7 kpc . as viewed from far above the galactic plane , they tile the local region of the galactic disk , forming three complete 360  rings of cells , with the whole pattern centered on the sun .",
    "the angular size of a cell along its @xmath52-dimension decreases with distance so that we can keep the corresponding spatial scale ( measured in pc ) is approximately constant .",
    "thus , the number of cells in a given ring increases with the @xmath53-value of that ring .",
    "the cells angular size along the @xmath47-dimension also decreases with distance , for the same reason .",
    "the cells linear sizes deviate somewhat from 400 pc , especially along the @xmath47 dimension , for reasons explained below .",
    "for each cell , we construct foreground ( background ) cells that are similar to the main cell but centered on the near ( far ) face of the main cell ( see fig .  7 ) .",
    "as described in the next section , the polarization measurements for `` foreground stars '' ( stars lying within the foreground cell ) are used to correct the polarization measurements for each `` backgound star '' ( star lying in the background cell ) , thus providing a set of rough estimates for the stellar polarization induced by dust lying within the main cell .    as noted above",
    ", our intent was to have cells with dimensions corresponding to the accumulation scale , estimated to be 400 pc .",
    "we modified the in - plane spatial footprint of each cell , ( @xmath55 ) , from ( 400 pc , 400 pc ) to ( 300 pc , 500 pc ) in order to take into account the uncertainty in stellar distances .",
    "this is why the three rings are separated by 500 pc in @xmath53 . at the distance of our furthest background cells , centered at @xmath53 =",
    "( 1.7 + 0.25 = 1.95 ) kpc , the 20% distance uncertainty translates to approximately 400 pc .",
    "thus , even after increasing @xmath56 from 400 to 500 pc , distance uncertainty is still an important limitation to the accuracy of our analysis .",
    "however , increasing @xmath56 to 600 pc or higher while preserving non - overlapping cells would have resulted in a sample containing only two rings of cells rather than three , as there would not have been enough space for the foreground cells corresponding to the closest ring of main cells .    for each ring",
    ", we adjusted @xmath57 slightly from 300 pc so that the full 360  are covered by an integer number of cells .",
    "for the 1.7 kpc ring , the longitudinal dividing lines of the cells are chosen so that one cell is centered on ngc 6334 .",
    "for the two closer rings , we have arbitrarily chosen @xmath58 as a dividing line .",
    "the size of the cells along the direction perpendicular to the galactic plane ( @xmath59 ) has been set at 120 pc .",
    "the reason that we chose such a relatively small value for @xmath59 is related to the scale height of galactic gas . since the thickness of the hi  disk is 240 pc ( spitzer 1978 ) , setting @xmath59 to 400 pc",
    "would have resulted in the inclusion of relatively high - latitude background stars having relatively little dust within the main cell .",
    "the polarization induced by this relatively small column of dust would have been very small , so the inferred foreground - corrected polarization angles corresponding to these stars would have been very uncertain . because our method for determining the mean magnetic field angle for each cell (   3.5.3 ) gives equal weight to each background star , the use of @xmath59 = 400 pc would have thus resulted in loss of accuracy .",
    "we chose @xmath59 to equal half of the thickness of the hi disk in order to preferentially sample the denser part of this gas layer .",
    "note also that all four of the gmcs observed with sparo lie within 30 pc of the galactic plane .",
    "the resulting @xmath60 sizes are @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 for rings at @xmath53 = 0.7 , 1.2 , and 1.7  kpc , respectively .",

    "the polarization residues for the ngc 6334 cell are shown in the top panel of figure 8 .      as discussed in   3.5.1 , there is evidence for malmquist bias in the heiles ( 2000 ) database .",
    "if we assume that this bias is the only effect contributing to the flattening of the extinction curve of figure 6 , then we can derive a `` bias correction '' that we can apply to the heiles database in order to remove the effects of the malmquist bias .",
    "although it is not clear that all of the flattening is due to malmquist bias (   3.5.1 ) , we will nevertheless apply this correction in order to get a rough idea of the possible effects of the bias on our analysis .",
    "our bias correction is based on the reasonable assumption that the bias affects the normalized stokes parameters @xmath75 and @xmath76 in the same way that it affects the measured values of selective extinction .",

    "if we apply this bias correction to the heiles data before using it in our analysis , we find that 10 cells ( rather than 11 ) survive the various cuts . the resulting distribution of magnetic field directions for these cells is shown in figure 10 .",

    "this in turn might be expected to reduce the agreement among vectors in a given cell and lead to rejection of the cell . in this case , applying the correction to the surviving cells , that have relatively weaker malmquist bias , will result in over - correction . keeping these possibilities in mind ,",
    "all we can conclude from our analysis is that our best estimate for the true distribution of field directions probably lies somewhere between the histograms of figures 9 and 10 .    in   3.3 , we noted that three of our four gmcs have mean magnetic field directions lying very close to the galactic plane , and that the probability of this being due to chance alignment is very low .",

    "the degree of optical polarization is linearly proportional to column density , while the submillimeter polarization magnitude has no dependence on column density ( for low optical depth ) .",
    "this illustrates that it is the submillimeter polarized flux rather than the submillimeter polarization magnitude that will generally be proportional to the optical polarization magnitude .",
    "thus , when we bin optical polarization vectors to sparo s resolution , we should combine them as if they were polarized flux , using the method of stokes parameters . in principle",
    ", we should combine stokes parameters derived from each simulation resolution element that lies within a 4  sparo beam , but ostriker et al .",
    "( 2001 ) only give optical polarization vectors for a 12 @xmath84 12 grid of points .",
    "however , this grid is dense enough to provide many optical vectors per sparo beam ( see below ) so it should be sufficient for reasonable estimates .",
    "the length l of each side of the cubical simulation box of ostriker et al.(2001 ) is not well defined , but by assuming a temperature of 10 k and a mean density of 100 @xmath24 they obtain l = 8 pc for the m = 7 simulations . for ngc 6334 , where our beam size is approximately 2 pc , we thus obtain 16 simulated sparo vectors from each simulated cloud map ( each vector is derived from binning nine simulated optical vectors ) . the resulting o.p .",
    "values are 0.97 and 0.15 for @xmath79 = 0.01 and @xmath85 , respectively . for g333.6 - 0.2 , we obtain only four simulated sparo vectors ( each comes from binning 36 simulated optical vectors ) and we find o.p .",
    "values of 0.98 and 0.35 for the low and high @xmath79 cases , respectively .",
    "g331.5 - 0.1 is too distant for meaningful comparisons .",
    "our results for the carina nebula are not suitable for comparison with the turbulence simulations of ostriker et al .",
    "the reason is that these authors simulated the inertial range of the turbulence , with a kolgomorov type energy spectrum over the entire 8 pc simulation cube .",
    "our observation of carina , on the other hand , shows field structure determined by the @xmath3 10 pc scale curvature of the hii  bubbles ( fig .  5 ) ,",
    "not a turbulent cascade in the inertial range .",
    "the field structure is the result of energy injection , with bubbles depositing energy directly into the field on @xmath3 10 pc scales .",
    "the simulated turbulence maps correspond to the case where the initial field direction is perpendicular to the line of sight , so the o.p .",
    "values we have derived from the simulations are in fact upper limits .",
    "24 of ostriker et al .",
    "( 2001 ) shows that the angle between the field and the line of sight has a dramatic effect on the degree of disorder in the inferred field directions .    from our maps of ngc 6334 and g333.6 - 0.2",
    ", we obtain o.p .",
    "values of 0.73 and 0.80 , respectively , indicating that @xmath79 = 0.01 is preferred over @xmath83 .",
    "the product of @xmath79 with the square of the mach number gives the `` turbulent beta '' , @xmath86 , which provides a direct comparison of magnetic and turbulent energy densities .",
    "we see that our comparison strongly favors @xmath86 = 0.5 over @xmath87 , implying that the magnetic energy density is comparable to the turbulent energy density .",
    "there are two main limitations to our comparison of sparo data with simulations .",
    "first , there is a relatively small overlap between the smaller spatial scales of the simulations and the larger scales of the sparo data .",
    "secondly , the assumption that all grains have equal polarizing efficiency is probably wrong ( cho &  lazarian 2005 ) . despite these questions",
    ", it seems difficult to reconcile our observations of reasonably uniform fields with models having very weak fields .",
    "we showed in ",
    "3.3 that three of our four target gmcs have mean field directions , determined from sparo data , that are within 15  of the galactic plane .",
    "as we noted , the probability for obtaining this result by pure chance is below 2% .",
    "this suggests a correlation between gmc fields and the larger - scale galactic field .",
    "ngc 6334 is the outlier in our sample of four gmcs , having its mean field rotated 70  clockwise from the plane . in   3.5 we used the heiles ( 2000 ) stellar polarization database to examine galactic fields on scales roughly corresponding to the gmc accumulation length ( @xmath3 400 pc ) .",
    "we obtained mean field directions for a set of 10 - 11 regions , one of which is centered on the closest of our four targets , ngc 6334 , while none of the other sparo targets is close enough to obtain reliable determinations of field direction from the heiles database . within this sample of 10 - 11 regions , we again find a tendency for the `` accumulation - scale field '' to be parallel to the galactic plane ( figs .  9 and 10 ) and",
    "we find that ngc 6334 is again an outlier in the distribution , having its `` accumulation - scale field '' more aligned with the galactic latitude direction than with the galactic longitude direction .",
    "we can explain both the tendency for fields in gmcs to align with the galactic plane and also the agreement of the field direction in ngc 6334 with the direction of the galactic field local to ngc 6334 by supposing that fields in gmcs are generally parallel to the local galactic fields .",
    "is this effect seen in simulations of gmc formation ?",
    "mhd simulations of the process whereby gas uniformly spread through a galactic disk becomes concentrated into gmcs via self - gravitating instabilities have been carried out , for example , by kim &  ostriker ( 2001 ) , and kim , ostriker , &  stone ( 2003 ) .",
    "the work by kim &  ostriker ( 2001 ) included only two dimensions ( thin disk limit ) , and the particular instabilities that they studied for the galactic disk ( as opposed to the galactic center ) took too long to develop .",
    "they were thus judged to be unlikely candidates for gmc formation unless they could be enhanced by additional agents .",
    "nevertheless , for purposes of comparison with our observations we note that their model m23 ( fig .",
    "13 of their paper ) shows continuity and alignment between fields inside dense clouds and those in the lower density surrounding medium , while their model m10 ( fig .",
    "12 ) shows no such correlation .",
    "the main difference is the field strength .    in principle",
    ", comparisons of such models with our results could test theories for gmc formation , but in practice such comparisons may lead to ambiguous results , for present simulations .",
    "the problem is that the simulations seem to produce only clouds having angular momentum perpendicular to the galactic plane . for the 2d simulations this is true by definition , but even in the 3d simulations of kim et al .",
    "( 2003 ) we find that angular momentum of collapsing gas clouds is orthogonal to the plane , presumably because it is inherited from galactic shear . in this case the predominant mode for field distortion is to shear the fields out into spiraling patterns , with the spiral lying in the galactic plane ( fig .",
    "12 of kim &  ostriker 2001 ) . unfortunately , because sparo sightlines extending from the sun to disk gmcs are parallel to the plane , the in - plane spiral field distortion patterns described above will be indistinguishable from the case of continuous , ordered fields extending into gmcs with no or little change in direction .",
    "could the correlation we observed between gmc fields and local galactic fields be merely a consequence of field twisting induced by clouds rotating preferentially about axes orthogonal to the galactic plane ? while we can not rule this out , it is worth noting that observations of gmcs in m 33 ( rosolowsky et al .",
    "2003 ) have failed to find a strong tendency for cloud rotational axes to be perpendicular to the disk of this spiral galaxy .",
    "thus it seems that the more likely explanation for the correlations we have discovered is that galactic fields do indeed pass into gmcs with little change in direction .",
    "when more realistic mhd simulations are available that better match the recent observational data on cloud rotation axes , it will be interesting to compare them with our observations of magnetic field strucuture .",

    "<S> we find that the region surrounding ngc 6334 is an outlier in the distribution of field directions determined from optical polarimetry , just as the ngc 6334 cloud is an outlier in the distribution of cloud field directions determined by sparo . in both cases the field direction corresponding to ngc </S>",
    "<S> 6334 is rotated away from the direction of the plane by a large angle ( @xmath0 60 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this finding is consistent with our suggestion that field direction tends to be preserved during gmc formation . finally , we compare the disorder in our magnetic field maps with the disorder seen in magnetic field maps derived from mhd turbulence simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude from these comparisons that the magnetic energy density in our clouds is comparable to the turbulent energy density . </S>"
