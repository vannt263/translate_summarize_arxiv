    "we focus on the sources that are the most relevant experimentally : random potentials created by charged impurities .",

    ". however , for sufficiently strong disorder , the excitation gap closes and the majorana modes no longer exist . adding disorder induces localization , and the topological non - trivial phase transforms into trivial phase , which is characterized by the closing of the gap@xcite and by a spectral weight distributed over a wide energy range .",

    "the obtained result is consistent with previous work.@xcite at low energies ( @xmath62 ) , the frequency dependence of the dynamically generated terms in the self - energy can be neglected , and the effective proximity gap is independent of @xmath60 . with the increase of @xmath61 ,  the self energy @xmath43 increases , and",
    "the strong coupling make it would require extremely high magnetic fields to reach the topologically nontrivial phase . in the bottom figure of fig .",
    "3 , both sm and sc are considered to be under the same zeeman field @xmath25 , which is possible under experimental condition .",
    "it is found that the gap closes and the majorana zero - mode disappears .",
    "that may be one reason why it s difficult to observe mf in experiment , and this condition should be avoided .",
    "moreover , suppressing effects of disorder and controlling fluctuations of other parameters are challenging tasks . the disorder in sm wire has been discussed above , and we will investigate the other two types of disorder .",
    "firstly , we discuss the disorder in sm - sc coupling , @xmath63 , where @xmath64 represents the random component .",
    "as can be seen from fig .",
    "4 , the signature features of the topological nontrivial phase are preserved for weak or mediate disorder .",
    "this is consistent with ref .",
    "strong disorder induce the disappearance of the zero majorana modes , and the spectral gets localized .",
    "similar phenomenon can be observed in the presence of nonuniform sc surface , @xmath65 , where @xmath66 are normally distributed .",
    "therefore , any other significant type of disorder generates the same ldos behavior , and does not change the key property of majorana bound states before reach a certain size .      in this part",
    ", the majorana end states are discussed outside the strict one - dimensional limit .",
    "5 shows the phase diagram for the two - band nanowire model as a function of the chemical potential @xmath3  and external magnetic field @xmath25 .",
    "the emergent region of majorana modes in the system and the corresponding phase diagram are obtained by using local tunneling .",
    "tunneling of electrons to the ends of the nanowire would reveal a pronounced zero - bias peak , in particular , it is @xmath67 in the topological nontrivial phase , @xmath68 , in contrast to that for a dot coupled to a regular fermionic zero mode , @xmath69 , and its topologically trivial phase , @xmath70.@xcite in fig .",
    "5(a ) , when the confinement energy and spin - orbit band mixing energy @xmath71 , the two bands decouple and majorana fermions emerge from different transverse subbands at same regions @xmath72 , which is similar to two physically different chains . however , the much strong zeeman field @xmath73 generates a transition from topological nontrivial phase to trivial phase .",
    "the blue @xmath74  region corresponds to nontopological phase , @xmath69 . with the increase of @xmath75 ,",
    "5(b ) , the confinement energy is switched on , and majorana fermions of two subbands emerge inside different regions @xmath76 .",
    "five distinct phases can be observed , nontopological ( @xmath74  region ) , topological trivial phase ( red region ) , topological nontrivial phase with majorana fermions originating either from first or second subband , and the last one with two majorana modes localized on each end ( @xmath77  region ) . in fig .",
    "5(c ) , the spin - orbit band mixing energy @xmath55  modifies the phase boundary .",
    "the most interesting parameter regimes is @xmath78 , two subbands are in topological trivial phase , and two topological nontrivial phases of subbands ca nt coexist . in the presence of strong interband mixing @xmath79 , as shown in fig .",
    "5(d ) , there is a new window where topological phases from different subbands coexist . at @xmath80",
    "the width of the topologically nontrivial region is given by @xmath81 .",
    "the topological phase around this region is to a large extent robust against chemical potential fluctuations , which now have to be @xmath82 to cause the transition into the topological trivial state .",
    "this regime provides a promising route to realizing a robust topological nontrivial phase .",
    "however , according to our calculation , in this coexisting region , the disorder in the spin - orbit band mixing energy @xmath55  has a sensitive effect on the stability of topological phases . even for a weak disorder ,",
    "the topological gap closes and the mf disappears , which is different from other types of disorder in systems .",
    "it is therefore required strict conditions to obtain the mf in this region .",
    "two coupled transverse subbands is similar to two physically different chains .",
    "if we change the phase of one band or chain , the other one will also changes . in fig .",
    "6 , the two bands have two sets of control parameters , and we let the two bands be in topological trivial phase firstly ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "then the band 1 is tuned in topological nontrivial phase ( @xmath84 ) , and fig .",
    "6(a)-(b ) corresponds to band 1 and 2 .",
    "it is found that the band 2 is also in topological nontrivial phase through the spin - orbit band mixing energy @xmath55 . in fig .",
    "6(c)-(d ) , the two bands have same parameters except for @xmath21  ( @xmath85 ) . in this parameter region , the two isolated bands can be in topological nontrivial phase , respectively . but these two bands will be in topological trivial phase when they couple to each other .",
    "therefore , the multiband case or several coupled chains can provide a new way to control the existence of mfs and achieve non - abelian braiding .",
    "in this section , we study intragap bound states in the topological phase of a rashba nanowire with non - uniform spin - orbit interaction and magnetic field .",
    "the zero - energy intragap bound states can serve as a mediator to achieve majorana fermion exchange in strictly one dimensional structures .",
    "firstly , we consider a situation where the soi vector changes its direction along the nanowire axis creating an interface between two nanowires with different soi vector directions .",
    "the non - uniform nanowire of length @xmath86directed along @xmath7 direction which consists of two segments , @xmath22  and @xmath23  in which the corresponding soi vectors  are in different directions . in the particular case , when the soi has a sharp discontinuity , such that the soi vector rapidly rotates by the angle @xmath87 , equivalently , changes its sign , the system possesses an additional symmetry that constrains the fermionic bound states to be zero - energy states . in fig .",
    "7 , we have calculated the ldos vs @xmath60  and lattice sites @xmath13 for different spin - orbit interaction , including strength and direction . the ldos symmetries between positive and negative energy is preserved , but which is destroyed at two ends of the wire . the soi @xmath21  in the top of fig .",
    "7 have the same direction but with different strength .",
    "there are zero - energy majorana bound states localized at the nanowire ends @xmath88 .",
    "having a little change on the strength of soi does not destroy the signature features of the two phase , and the obtained results are consistent with the discussion of disorder . in the middle figure , @xmath89  for @xmath22and@xmath90  for @xmath23 ,",
    "the half is in topological trivial phase in the region where @xmath91 , and the dos spreads over the entire energy range as there is no finite gap . in the topological nontrivial part , @xmath92 , one majorana zero modes localizes at left end , but the other majorana zero modes is delocalized and spreads over the @xmath23 part of the wire .",
    "this is due to hybridization of the right hand majorana with continuum zero energy levels where the gap is closed . in the bottom figure , the two half wire",
    "have two @xmath21  with same strength but opposite directions , and additional fermionic bound states emerge inside the proximity gap .",
    "they are localized at the junction between two wire sections characterized by different directions of the soi vectors , and they coexist with majorana bound states localized at the nanowire ends .  in the particular case ,",
    "when soi change its sign , the fbss and mbss are degeneracy since both are zero - energy states.@xcite    as discussed above , we only show that the fbs is at the interface in the center of the nanowire .",
    "if we change the position of the interface from left to right of the wire , the fbs can serve as a mediator to transfer majorana fermion , and even exchange mfs in strictly one dimensional structures .",
    "the interface is created between two parts with different soi vector directions , and we let the interface localize at the position of left end of the wire firstly . in this case , the fbs is overlapped with mbs of left end , and there are no fbss in the gap .",
    "changing the position of the interface from left to right , the information of left mbs can be carried to the right .",
    "when the interface localizes at the right end of the wire , the fbs overlaps with the right mbs , and serves as a mediator to transfer information . by fine tuning the parameter , this method even can achieve majorana fermion exchange in strictly one dimensional structures .",
    "_ have demonstrated the mf exchange in 1d structures using @xmath0 domain wall by tuning the phase of order parameter @xmath93 .",
    "the non - uniform rashba soi nanowire can also be used to implement protected quantum computation .    to get a deep insight into the additional fbss ,",
    "the energy spectrum and electron wave function have been calculated . as shown in fig .",
    "8 , the spectra of uniform nanowire with an odd number of pairs of zero - energy modes characterizes topological sc phases .",
    "the in - gap states are majorana zero - energy modes .",
    "when @xmath91 , the gap disappears , it is because that the half wire with zero @xmath21 is in topological trivial phase .",
    "therefore , the continuous excitation can cover the entire energy regime . for opposite direction of soi vector , there are two pairs of zero - energy states in the gap , which are energy degenerate mbss and fbss . note",
    "that fbs only exist at zero energy if the angle between soi vectors is @xmath0 . for a different angle fbs",
    "are not zero energy , and as this angle goes to zero , the states merge in the continuum of excitations.@xcite      next , we replace the uniform magnetic field by non - uniform field .",
    "a uniform magnetic field perpendicular to soi vector can induce a topological phase where mbss are formed at the ends of the wire .",
    "the features illustrated in fig .",
    "9 are in non - uniform magnetic field .",
    "firstly , we let the magnetic field in the two half wire have same direction but with different strength .",
    "the majorana bound states are also localized at the ends of the wire . as @xmath94 for @xmath23 , there is a gap with no states , since this part of the system is in the non - topological phase .",
    "the mbss localize at the ends of the other half wire for @xmath22 , where the system is in the topological phase .",
    "when the two half wire have opposite magnetic field , two additional peaks emerge in the mini - gap , and coexist with the mbss localizing at the ends of the whole wire .",
    "these two peaks have finite energies , which are close to zero - energy .",
    "similar to non - uniform spin - orbit interaction , some intragap bound states emerge in the topological phase .",
    "but they are not degenerate with majorana zero - energy modes .",
    "it is also interesting to discuss the effect of disorder on fbss .",
    "here we only show the disorder of random potentials created by charged impurities in sm nanowire with non - uniform rashba soi and zeeman field .",
    "different from the behavior of mbss in disorder wire , as shown in fig .",
    "10 ( a)-(b ) , the zero - energy fbs not only coexists with mbs in weak disorder , but also localizes at the interface in strong disorder , where the mbs disappears . in fig .",
    "10(c)-(e ) , with the increase of disorder , the non - zero energy fbss caused by opposite zeeman field run away from zero - energy and disappear in the continuum excitation states .",
    "therefore , the intragap bound states are more stable than mbss , and can be serve as an potential way to transfer quantum information .      similarly , here we consider a double topological junction composed of two soi - junction discussed above . in fig .",
    "11(a)-(b ) , there are two fbss localizing at the two junctions .",
    "this behavior is very much reminiscent of double quantum dots,@xcite which suggests that such double fbss can serve as a promising platform for conventional charge qubits .",
    "embedding such charge qubits in a topological superconductor might be rather well protected against environmental noise and thus enjoy unusually large dephasing times . with the increase of topological @xmath0 junction in the sm nanowire , shown in fig .",
    "11(c ) , the zero - energy modes increase . when one dot is connected to two majorana modes , as shown in fig .",
    "11(d)-(e ) , the energetically degenerate states in flensberg s qubits can be obtained , and through which the two mbss reduces to a single effective mbs.@xcite in fig .",
    "11(d ) , the semiconductor nanowire has uniform soi vector , and the energetically degenerate states can be achieved as the phase difference is @xmath95 , where @xmath96  is the magnetic flux through the loop . in fig .",
    "11(e ) , non - uniform spin - orbit interaction is used , the behavior of the dot spectrum is nearly the same except for the @xmath0 phase shift . in this case , only when @xmath97 , the energetically degenerate state in flensberg s qubit can be obtained .",
    "it is because of the topological @xmath0junction , changing the sign of the rashba coupling @xmath21  is effectively equivalent to imposing a rigid phase shift of @xmath0  to the order parameter .",
    "therefore , the flux qubit in flensberg s qubit can be canceled out and the hybrid system becomes more controllable and scalable .",
    "if there are even number of junction in the wire , the phase shift of andreev spectrum disappears .    a t - junction , three segments meeting at a point , provides the simplest wire network that enables meaningful adiabatic exchange of majorana fermions.alicea2011non-abelian in this part",
    ", we ll discuss the intragap bound states at the three segment junction as a function of soi vector . as fig .",
    "12 illustrated , the horizontal and vertical wires are taken to consist of @xmath98 and @xmath99  sites , and the phases of every segments are defined such that the site indices increase upon moving towards the junction , @xmath100 .",
    "the recursive green s function method is used to calculated the ldos,@xcite where @xmath13corresponds to a set of @xmath13th slice of the t - junction .",
    "there are three cases to consider that one , two , or three of the wire segments emanating from the junction reside in a topological region .",
    "when only one segment is in the topological superconducting state , there are only two mfs and one localizes at the junction . in fig .",
    "12 , two topological segments with same soi vector , @xmath101 , induce two pairs of mfs emerging , and two mfs exist at the junction , where forming a @xmath0 junction .",
    "it is also interesting to note that there is zero - energy states in vertical wire , although it is in non - topological phase .",
    "the reason is that the vertical wire forms @xmath0 junction between two horizontal wires .",
    "but as @xmath102 @xmath103 ,  two soi vector with opposite direction , the two segment end mfs at the junction combine into an finite - energy ordinary fermion .",
    "finally , consider the case shown in fig .",
    "13 where all three segments are topological , there are three pairs of mfs exist at every segment end when @xmath104 . tuning the direction of the soi vector , @xmath105 , the t - junction always supports four majorana zero modes and one ordinary finite - energy fermion , among which one mbs and the ordinary fermion localize at the junction . here",
    "the hamiltonian of the junction simplifies to @xmath106 , where @xmath107  is the hopping matrix between @xmath99th and @xmath108th slice , and @xmath109 indicates the majorana fermions in each wire .",
    "it follows that the linear combination @xmath110  remains a zero - energy majorana mode , while @xmath111  and @xmath112  combined into a finite - energy fermion .",
    "it is imperative to avoid generating spurious zero modes at the t - junction as we braid mbss . in the presence of non - uniform rashba soi nanowire",
    ", the t - junction can achieve more quantum operation and become a potential quantum device .",
    "the case of non - uniform rashba soi and zeeman field is also consider in multiband wire , and the main results are shown in fig .",
    "14 and 15 .",
    "firstly , the two bands have non - uniform rashba soi @xmath21 , shown in fig .",
    "14(a ) , a pair of zero - energy fbss appear in the intragap . in fig .",
    "14(b ) , there are two pairs of non - zero energy fbss in the two band nanowire , whose results are similar to the result in single band . in fig .",
    "14(c ) , the band 1 is uniform but band 2 is not , @xmath113 , the topological gap in @xmath23  part is closed , and the right hand majorana fermion hybridizes with continuum zero energy levels .",
    "the behavior of the ldos is the same as that of fig . 7 , where one half of wire has zero rashba soi @xmath21 .",
    "this is because that the right  parts of the two bands has rashba soi with opposite direction , and the effect of opposite @xmath21 is the same as zero rashba soi .",
    "therefore , we investigate the case of non - uniform @xmath21  and non - uniform zeeman field in band 2 , respectively .",
    "it is found that the opposite @xmath21 can close the gap of right part completely , but the opposite zeeman field only narrow the gap",
    ". meanwhile , the intragap bound states hybridize with the continuum excitation states .",
    "in this paper , we have developed the recursive green s function method for the realization and the observation of the emergent non - abelain majorana mode in some model semiconductor nanowires proximity coupled to an ordinary _ s_-wave superconductor in the presence of various disorder , non - uniform spin - orbit interaction , and non - uniform zeeman field .",
    "three types of disorder , such as disorder in semiconductor nanowire , bulk superconductor and semiconductor - superconductor interface , are included to characterize their effects on the stability of the topological phase .",
    "it is found that the signature features of the topological sc phase do not depend on the type or the source of disorder .",
    "the weak disorder induces strongly localized of the low - energy states , but preserve the signature features . in the topological phase of a rashba nanowire with non - uniform soi vector or zeeman field , the fermionic bound states can emerge inside the proximity gap , localizing at the junction between two wire sections characterized by different directions of the soi vectors , and they coexist with mbs localized at the nanowire ends .",
    "changing the position of the topological @xmath0junction from one end to the other , the zero - energy fbs can be used as mediator to transfer quantum information between two distance mfs , even achieve mf exchange in 1d wire .",
    "specially , the @xmath0  junction induced fermionic bound states can always exist even for strong disorder , where the topological gap closes .",
    "for a double topological junction composed of two soi - junction , two zero - energy fbss exist at the two junction , which can hybridize and serve as an effective mediator of hybridization between two distant mbss .",
    "meanwhile , the andreev spectrum of nanowire with an odd number of topological junctions is qualitatively phase shift by @xmath0 compared to usual majorana weak links .",
    "the t - junction provides the simplest wire network that enables meaningful adiabatic exchange of the majorana fermions .",
    "it is imperative that we avoid generating spurious zero - modes to braid mfs at the t - junction . by tuning the direction of soi vector among the three segments ,",
    "the three mfs at the junction combine into a zero - energy majorana mode and a finite - energy fermion . for multiband nanowires , by detecting the spectrum of the coupled quantum dot , we have calculated the phase diagram of the system .",
    "the strong interband mixing due to @xmath79 determines the region where the nontrivial sc states can emerge , and @xmath79 is crucial for the topological stability of the nontrivial phase .",
    "the region is to a large extent robust against chemical potential fluctuations , and this effect is particularly important for experimental realization of majorana fermions in multiband nanowires . in two - band wire or two coupled single band wire , the phase of one band can be controlled through the other band , and it provides another way to achieve quantum operations . if the two bands are in topological nontrivial phase , but with opposite rashba soi , the topological gap will be closed , and mf disappears .",
    "these properties is critical for us to build multiband quantum device .",
