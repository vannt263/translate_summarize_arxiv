    "it is well known that multiple antennas can substantially increase the capacity of a point - to - point fading channel and can also significantly improve the reliability of communications via space diversity .",
    "interestingly , both these gains can be obtained without having any csi at the transmitter  @xcite .",
    "in fact , even with full non - causal transmit csi , the ergodic capacity of multi - antenna links can not be improved substantially at high snr ( specifically , the scaling law of the capacity with snr remains the same ) .",
    "this motivates the question of whether any knowledge of the channel at the transmitter could improve the reliability of multi - antenna channels .",
    "there is a large body of work in characterizing the reliability gains of multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) block - fading channels  @xcite .",
    "when the transmitter has no csi , zheng and tse  @xcite characterized the tradeoffs between the rate and the reliability exponent at high snrs by analyzing what is referred to as the outage event and proving that the overall error probability is dominated by the probability of the outage event .",
    "specifically , outage refers to the event that the channel realization during the code length interval is too poor to support the given rate  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that for a channel with coherence interval @xmath2 , the reliability exponent of a block code of blocklength @xmath3 depends only on rate and the number of antennas and does not depend on the code length @xmath3 ( when @xmath3 is larger than the total number of transmit and receive antennas ) . in this setting , the decoding delay is , of course , equal to the code blocklength @xmath3 is less than or equal to the coherence interval @xmath2 of the channel .",
    "results for @xmath4 are straightforward generalizations but are omitted . ] .",
    "any side information which is correlated to the channel conditions when made available to the transmitter , including causal csi  @xcite and/or decoder status  @xcite , can potentially improve the rate and reliability .",
    "in particular , it is well known that feedback can substantially improve the error exponent of additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channels via variable length coding and power control assuming no strict delays and peak power constraints  @xcite . for block - fading channels , in @xcite an automatic retransmission request ( arq )",
    "is shown to substantially improve the diversity gain by allowing codeword retransmissions ( random variable - length channel codes ) with the aid of noiseless one - bit decision feedback and power control .",
    "therefore , in a communication system with feedback , the decoding time @xmath5 ( @xmath6channel uses ) is a random variable depending on @xmath3 and the state of the decoder . in order to capture this random decoding delay ,",
    "burnashev introduced the notion of error exponents for a feedback code which transmits one of @xmath7 messages in _ expected time _ at most @xmath3  @xcite .    in this paper , our focus is on the former type of transmitter side information , namely causal csi . in particular , we assume that the transmitter has access to only one noiseless bit of causal side information per coherence interval from the receiver which describes the channel state as being `` good '' ( above a predecided threshold ) or bad ( below the threshold ) .",
    "this type of channel state feedback has substantially less coding complexity than that of the arq systems as it only requires the knowledge of the channel state and not the status of the decoder .",
    "following  @xcite , we define the reliability function as the smallest error probability that can be achieved by a code of length @xmath3 which transmits one of @xmath8 messages in the expected time at most @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the multiplexing gain and @xmath11 tends to zero as the snr @xmath12 goes to infinity . by leveraging this side information and",
    "the notion of an expected decoding delay , we show that the reliability function can be substantially improved in the high snr regime . in our scheme , transmission occurs only when the channel satisfies a certain condition which can be ascertained at the receiver .",
    "therefore , similar to feedback channels , the decoding delay is random and rate may be reduced as we do not use the channel all the time  @xcite .",
    "however , it turns out that in the regime of high snr , the channel most likely satisfies the conditions and thus the scaling law of the rate remains unchanged .",
    "when there is no delay constraint and noiseless one - bit causal csi feedback is available , we show that the outage events can be completely avoided and an error exponent which is as good as that of a pure multi - antenna awgn channel without fading can be attained . in this case , in sharp contrast to the case where the transmitter has no csi , the error probability approaches zero exponentially with the _ blocklength _ for all multiplexing gains .",
    "we further consider the case where the decoding delay has a strict deterministic deadline , that is , a finite maximum delay constraint , in which the receiver has to decode the message in at most @xmath13 coherence intervals . in this case , it is clear that outage events can not be avoided and the effects of fading will reappear .",
    "however , we show that a substantial gain on the reliability function can be achieved even with a specified finite maximum decoding delay . for instance , in a channel with @xmath7 transmit antennas , and one receive antenna , @xmath14 of the diversity gain of an awgn channel can be attained with a worst case delay of @xmath15 .",
    "this shows when @xmath16 and @xmath17 , we only need a delay of @xmath18 to completely overcome the effects of fading and approach the performance of mimo awgn channels .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : bkgnd ] , we present the channel model and introduce the problem set - up . in section  [ sec : inftydelay ] , we obtain the reliability exponent when there is no bound on the worst case delay . in section  [ sec : findelay ] , we analyze the case where the maximum decoding delay is bounded and treat the scenarios with and without a finite peak to average power constraint .",
    "we consider a frequency - flat block - fading mimo channel with @xmath7 transmit and @xmath19 receive antennas . the channel is assumed to remain fixed for @xmath2 channel uses ( the channel coherence interval ) and change independently to another state in the next block .",
    "therefore , within each coherence interval , the received signal at time @xmath20 can be expressed as , @xmath21 where @xmath12 is the average transmit power , @xmath22 denotes the ( fixed ) @xmath23 random fading channel matrix , and for each discrete time @xmath20 , @xmath24 denotes the @xmath25 channel input symbol and @xmath26 the @xmath27 additive white gaussian noise vector .",
    "all the entries of @xmath22 and @xmath26 are assumed to have a zero - mean , unit - variance , complex circular gaussian distribution .",
    "furthermore , the transmit message @xmath24 at each time @xmath20 is required to satisfy the average power constraint @xmath28 . in all random coding bounds for the reliability function , we assume @xmath24 to be a random gaussian codeword with blocklength @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath4 case can also be analyzed but is omitted for brevity .",
    "rate versus reliability tradeoffs have been well studied for point - to - point awgn channels through the notions of the error exponent ( large blocklength ) and the diversity gain ( large snr ) . for fading mimo channels with no transmit csi",
    ", zheng and tse studied the smallest error probability that can be achieved in the asymptotic of high snr by a code of size @xmath8 . in this regime ,",
    "the error probability is characterized by the diversity gain defined as , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the code rate in bits per channel use , @xmath3 is the code blocklength , and @xmath32 is the smallest achievable error probability for a rate-@xmath33 , blocklength @xmath3 code . it is further shown that when the transmitter has no csi , @xmath34 is given by a piecewise linear function connecting the points @xmath35 for @xmath36 . more explicitly , @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "it is interesting to note that unlike awgn channels , the error probability of fading channels ( without transmit csi ) tends to zero with an exponent _ independent of the code blocklength _ as long as @xmath41 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the error probability is dominated by the so - called outage error event : the event of having a sequence of atypically poor channel fading gains over the duration of a codeword . in this setting , in  @xcite it is shown that the optimal diversity gain can be achieved by using a fixed - length blockcode and when the _ decoding delay is equal to the length of the codeword blocklength _ @xmath3 .",
    "transmit side information in its broadest sense includes both csi and the received signal at the decoder ( feedback channels ) .",
    "it is folklore that while feedback can not improve the capacity of a discrete memoryless channel , it can improve the reliability function ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the gain in the reliability is achieved by leveraging ( @xmath0 ) the possibility of re - transmissions while keeping the codeword blocklength fixed , and ( @xmath1 ) using power control to boost the power when rare events happen @xcite .",
    "this implies that the decoding time @xmath5 is random and no longer equals the codeword length .",
    "for general dmcs , in  @xcite , burnashev obtained tight bounds on the smallest error probability of a code which transmits one of the messages in expected time at most @xmath3 , that is , @xmath42 and unbounded maximum delay  @xcite . in the asymptotic of large snr ,",
    "gamal , caire , and damen proposed an arq scheme and proved that a single noiseless bit of feedback per codeword block pertaining to the status of the decoder can substantially improve the reliability even when a finite maximum decoding delay constraint is imposed , that is , with a finite total number of retransmissions .",
    "inspired by these results on feedback channels , we explore the high - snr asymptotics of the channel reliability function with one noiseless bit of causal csi at the transmitter .",
    "we show that with this limited transmit csi and for a fixed codeword blocklength , the reliability function can be substantially improved even with a strict finite maximum decoding delay constraint .    here , the reliability function is defined in terms of the smallest achievable error probability for a blockcode of blocklength @xmath3 , size @xmath8 , and maximum decoding time of @xmath43 ( that is , @xmath44 ) . in particular , following  @xcite , we define the diversity gain with csi as @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath5 is decoding time , and the multiplexing gain @xmath10 is defined as , @xmath47    in this paper we assume that the transmitter knows , through one bit receiver feedback , whether or not the channel realization satisfies a predecided criterion before transmission .",
    "the transmitter leverages this side information to postpone the transmission upto the time that the channel is favorable .",
    "when @xmath13 is bounded and the transmitter has delayed the transmission for @xmath48 coherence blocks , the message will be sent in the next coherence block . in",
    "what follows , we investigate the behavior of @xmath49 for different values of @xmath13 .",
    "the reliability of mimo fading channels without transmit csi is dominated by the probability of the outage event  @xcite . however , in the asymptotic of large snr , the outage event is a rare event with a small probability of @xmath50 where @xmath34 is defined in ( [ eq : nnooo ] ) . therefore knowing whether or not the channel is in outage , messages can be scheduled for transmission only during favorable conditions .",
    "this would eliminate the atypical outage events and may also lead to unbounded decoding delay , though the expected delay can still be bounded .",
    "this is due to the fact there is a nonzero probability , however small , of arbitrarily long sequence of outage events .    when there is no maximum decoding delay constraint , we assume that the receiver sends one bit to the transmitter at the beginning of each coherence interval indicating the occurrence / non - occurrence of the event : @xmath51 a message is transmitted only when the channel fails to satisfy the condition @xmath52 .",
    "the following theorem provides the reliability function defined in ( [ eq : def - rel ] ) with @xmath13 infinite .",
    "* theorem  1 *  _ ( lower bound on diversity gain ) consider the channel of section  [ sec : chmdl ] with noiseless one - bit causal transmit csi confirming or denying condition @xmath52 . for any blocklength-@xmath3 , @xmath53 , there exists a block code with @xmath8 codewords for which @xmath54 where @xmath55 is as defined in ( [ eq : def - rel ] ) . _    * remark : * it is interesting to note that the error probability is now decreasing exponentially with the blocklength unlike the case where there is no transmit csi . comparing this error exponent with that of an awgn channel with the same snr , it is seen that the effect of channel fades can be completely removed .",
    "this substantial gain is obtained due to the relaxed ( but practical ) requirement on the decoding delay from being exactly equal to the codeword blocklength to being equal to the expected number of channel uses until codeword reception .",
    "it is straightforward to establish that the average decoding delay is equal to @xmath56 .",
    "_ proof - sketch : _ by bounding the determinant of a matrix by its minimum eigenvalue and its trace , it readily follows that @xmath57 .",
    "this implies that the decoding delay @xmath5 has a geometric distribution with parameter @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , the multiplexing gain as defined in ( [ defr ] ) is equal to , @xmath59 an achievable error probability can be found using the random coding bound . following  @xcite",
    ", we may write , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the complement of the event @xmath62 .    in the following section , we investigate the scenario in which the message decoding delay is bounded .",
    "in the previous section , we observed that a substantial gain can be obtained in the diversity gain with little csi at the transmitter at the cost of having the possibility of infinite decoding delays ( albeit with arbitrarily small probability for large snr ) . in this section ,",
    "we further impose a worst case delay constraint of @xmath13 for message decoding . in other words , we assume that the decoder has to decide on a message at most in @xmath13 coherence intervals of the channel . clearly , this would imply that there is a non - zero probability for a sequence of really bad channel events .",
    "when @xmath63 , the problem reduces to the problem considered in  @xcite with the only difference that the transmitter has 1-bit causal csi .",
    "since there is no possibility for postponing the transmission and power allocation optimization for one coherence interval does not change the diversity gain , it is straightforward to show that @xmath64 .    in this section , we prove that with only one bit causal csi feedback at the transmitter , one can substantially improve the diversity gain of codes of length @xmath3 by leveraging the possibility of postponing the transmission and/or exploiting the long - term average power constraint .",
    "this substantial gain is achieved by only transmitting when the channel is in a favorable condition or we have reached the maximum transmission delay . since the event of having a sequence of unfavorable channels is very unlikely , one can , without violating a long - term average ( over messages ) power constraint , boost the transmit power when faced with greater delays .",
    "we also explore the potential gains for a ( short - term ) peak to average power constraint .      here",
    "we assume that the receiver sends one bit feedback to the transmitter confirming or denying the following condition : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is defined as , @xmath67 where @xmath3 is the code blocklength , @xmath68 , and @xmath34 is as defined in ( [ eq : nnooo ] ) .",
    "of course , this is the outage event and has a probability of @xmath69 . in our transmission scheme ,",
    "the transmitter postpones the transmission until the channel belongs to the set of channels that do not satisfy the condition @xmath70 or reaches the maximum delay constraint of @xmath13 . in this transmission scheme",
    ", transmission always occurs with a transmit power @xmath12 .",
    "* theorem  2 *  _ for the channel of section  [ sec : chmdl ] , the diversity gain of a code of blocklength @xmath3 and cardinality @xmath8 , with short - term power constraint @xmath12 , is at least equal to @xmath71 for any @xmath72 , where @xmath68 , @xmath73 , and @xmath34 is as defined in ( [ eq : nnooo ] ) .",
    "_    _ proof - sketch : _ we use the random coding bound to obtain an upper bound on the error probability .",
    "we condition the error probability into two events , namely , @xmath74 @xmath75 : the channel realization satisfies @xmath76 in at least one out of the first @xmath48 coherence intervals , @xmath77 @xmath78 : the channel satisfies @xmath79 during all @xmath48 coherence intervals .",
    "the error probability in the event of @xmath75 can be easily bounded using the same approach as in theorem  1 as , @xmath80 also , note that the probability of the event @xmath81 is the event that condition @xmath79 ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : odef ] ) ) is met @xmath48 times .",
    "therefore , @xmath82 furthermore , conditioned on the event @xmath83 , the error probability is given by the error probability for @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , @xmath84 in order to calculate the largest achievable diversity gain , one needs to minimize the upper bound on the error probability in ( [ eq : bound - mas ] ) , that is , match the exponents by finding @xmath66 which satisfies , @xmath85 the expression in ( [ eq : def - f ] ) solves ( [ eq : fsol ] ) with @xmath86 replaced by the smaller value @xmath87 .",
    "this corresponds to minimizing a larger upper bound ( than in ( [ eq : bound - mas ] ) ) on the error probability . replacing @xmath66 in ( [ eq : bound - mas ] )",

    "figure  [ fig : fig2 ] shows the diversity multiplexing tradeoff for increasing values of @xmath13 .",
    "it is clear that with little side information and a small delay tolerance , the reliability function can be significantly improved .",
    "in the next section , we show that the gains with bounded delay can be further increased by exploiting a long - term power constraint , that is , by boosting the power when rare events happen .     for @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",

    "we show that we can further improve the reliability function using power control .",
    "side information here is assumed to be one bit causal csi that informs the transmitter whether the following condition is true or false : @xmath97 where @xmath0 denotes the number of consecutive channels that satisfies the conditions @xmath98 , respectively . here",
    "@xmath99 and @xmath100 are defined as ,    @xmath101    where @xmath102 .",

    "_    _ proof - sketch : _ the proof follows again using the random coding upper bound on the error probability .",
