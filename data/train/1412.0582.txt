    "the initial problem is embedded into a family of similar problems indexed by parameter @xmath49 , and it is shown that the dependence of the solution on @xmath49 is described by an ordinary differential equation with a relatively simple coefficient . then , the riemann  hilbert problem is reformulated as a problem for an oe  equation , i.  e.  a problem of reconstruction of the coefficients of an ode by using the boundary data .",
    "there is no analytical solution for the oe  problem in the general case , however some analytical technique is available in the commutative case @xcite .",
    "it is also worth to note that numerical solution of the oe  problem can be very efficient since the problem is of volterra nature ( the unknown function on a contour is found step by step ) .    to demonstrate the practical value of the analytical results obtained here we performed some computations of the directivities for an impedance strip and compared the results with the integral equation method .",
