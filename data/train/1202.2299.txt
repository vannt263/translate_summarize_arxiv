    "with the development of the modern accelerators the study of the meson and light baryon structure has been becoming one of the most exciting topics in physics .",
    "although the underlying theory of strong interaction , quantum chromodynamincs ( qcd ) , is known for a long period , its complexity in low energy region forces us to use some effective theories ( aside from lattice qcd ) , either based on the quark and gluon degrees of freedom , or some effective interactions between the mesons and baryons . among the various possible meson - baryon reactions , the reactions that involve strangeness are particularly interesting , due to the accessibility of the modern accelerators to strange particles such as kaons , @xmath9 , antikaons , @xmath10 , and hyperons , @xmath11 and @xmath6 .    in this study",
    "we focus on the electromagnetic excitations of @xmath6 hyperon ground state .",
    "the @xmath6 ground state , @xmath12 is @xmath13 and belongs to the spin 1/2 octet baryon multiplet , in which also the nucleons belong .",
    "the lowest mass of the @xmath6 excited state ( @xmath4 ) reported by the particle data group  @xcite is @xmath14 , a @xmath15 state .",
    "the @xmath14 state has collected a lot of interests over the years for the reasons following : ( i ) it has been suggested as a dynamically generated state ( molecular - like state ) composed largely of the @xmath16 and @xmath17 states  @xcite ; ( ii ) it is difficult to classify in terms of naive quark models based on @xmath18 symmetry . in the representation of spin - flavor @xmath18 symmetry",
    "the @xmath14 state can be a mixture of three distinct 3-quark states including the @xmath6-singlet state  @xcite . however , its mass is difficult to predict in karl - isgur model  @xcite , as well as in cloudy bag model ( cbm )  @xcite . in cbm",
    "the @xmath14 was interpreted primarily as a @xmath17 bound state  @xcite .",
    "thus , there is a strong indication that the @xmath14 is a dynamically generated meson - baryon molecular - like state with a single or a double pole structure  @xcite . in particular",
    ", it was demonstrated that the @xmath14 is composed substantially of the meson - baryon components within the chiral unitary model  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there are some works that support the @xmath14 as a 3-quark state  @xcite .",
    "therefore , to study the @xmath19 reaction is very interesting also by the reasons following . in one aspect",
    "this reaction has a possible analogy with the @xmath20 reaction . because @xmath19 is a transition between a @xmath21 and a @xmath22 states",
    ", we have a possibility to interpret the @xmath14 as a @xmath23-state excitation of one quark in the ground state @xmath12 , analogous to @xmath24 , a @xmath23-state excitation of the nucleon  @xcite . however , the @xmath14 has considerably lower mass than @xmath24 .",
    "furthermore , it has a larger mass difference with the nearest @xmath25-state partner @xmath26 compared to the case of @xmath24 and @xmath27 .",
    "the mass order is even reversed for the @xmath14 case .",
    "because of the reasons discussed above , it is very difficult to interpret naively @xmath14 as a simple @xmath23-state excitation of @xmath12 .",
    "searching for the next higher mass excited state of @xmath12 with @xmath28 , one finds @xmath29 , which can be an analogous with @xmath30 excitation of the nucleon , @xmath24 .",
    "since @xmath7 is the neutral @xmath11 ground state ( @xmath21 ) which belongs to the spin 1/2 octet baryon multiplet , and the @xmath8 reaction is similar to the @xmath19 reaction , we also focus on the @xmath8 reaction in this study . because the @xmath12 and @xmath31 are similar in masses , the two reactions differ mainly in the initial state quark configurations . as for the other interesting aspect ,",
    "we note that the @xmath29 resonance can also be described as a dynamically generated meson - baryon state  @xcite , and the @xmath0 transition form factors for @xmath1 , were calculated in chiral unitary model  @xcite .    in the previous works",
    ", a valence quark model was applied to study the @xmath20 reaction , and the corresponding transition form factors and helicity amplitudes were studied  @xcite .",
    "the reaction was also studied in a coupled - channels chiral dynamics ( chiral unitary model )  @xcite . in the chiral unitary model",
    "the contributions for the transition form factors come entirely from the meson - baryon states ( meson cloud effect ) .",
    "for the @xmath20 reaction the transition form factors @xmath32 ( dirac - type ) and @xmath33 ( pauli - type ) can be expressed in terms of the transverse ( @xmath34 ) and longitudinal ( @xmath35 ) helicity amplitudes  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was found that the @xmath32 can be explained very well just taking into account the valence quark effect .",
    "by contrast , the meson cloud seems to play a very important role for the @xmath33 , in particular in the low @xmath36 region  @xcite .",
    "then , such different roles between the valence quark and meson cloud effects may be reflected in the experimentally extracted helicity amplitudes @xmath35 and @xmath34 .",
    "this possibility was indeed demonstrated in ref .",
    "we will briefly review also these results .",
    "therefore , one of our main motivations of this study is to investigate whether or not the different roles of the valence quark and meson cloud effects observed for the @xmath20 reaction , can also be observed in the @xmath0 reactions with @xmath37 and @xmath7 . in particular",
    ", we focus on the structure of @xmath29 in this study . assuming that @xmath29 is a radial @xmath23-state excitation of @xmath12",
    ", we estimate the valence quark contributions for the @xmath0 transition form factors as well as the helicity amplitudes .",
    "for this purpose , we use the covariant spectator quark model  @xcite , which was successfully applied to the study of the @xmath20 reaction .",
    "the results of the covariant spectator quark model for the @xmath0 reaction are also compared with those obtained with the chiral unitary model  @xcite , where the @xmath4 is generated as a meson - baryon molecular - like state such as the @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 states .",
    "then , one of the interests is the structure of the @xmath29 state , namely , how it can be interpreted , either it is predominantly a meson - baryon molecular - like state , or dominated by the 3-valence - quark state .",
    "furthermore , we also show that the @xmath8 transition form factors depend crucially on the combination of the two unknown real phases ( signs ) , a phase between the @xmath6 and @xmath4 three - quark wave functions ( to be denoted by @xmath41 ) , and a phase between the @xmath6 and @xmath7 wave functions ( to be denoted by @xmath42 ) .",

    "this cancellation is also found for the helicity amplitudes ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the details ) .",
    "finally , we compare the valence quark contributions with those from the meson cloud for the reactions involving the @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the comparison is shown in fig .",
    "[ figlamb1670 ] , for the reactions involving the @xmath6 ( left panel ) and the @xmath7 ( right panel ) .",
    "note that the chiral unitary model results have both the real and imaginary parts and the absolute phases are fixed at @xmath246 to give a real and positive value of @xmath355 , or equivalently real and negative @xmath247 , as mentioned before .",
    "one can see in fig .",
    "[ figlamb1670 ] that the imaginary part is small in general .",
    "therefore , we will focus only on the real part hereafter .",
    "another interesting point is that , while the both form factors for the reaction involving the @xmath6 are dominated by the valence quark contributions , this is not the case for the reaction involving the @xmath7 . for the latter case one can see that the valence quark contributions for @xmath356 are larger than those from the meson cloud ( about 2.5 times near @xmath357 gev@xmath190 ) , although the magnitude is similar for @xmath358 .    a point of particular importance",
    "about @xmath359 is the relative sign between the valence and meson cloud contributions .",
    "since , as mentioned before , the factor @xmath42 is unknown at present , we can not decide if there is a positive or negative interference between the contributions .",
    "the results for the form factors involving the @xmath7 are determined using @xmath360 .",
    "if this is the case , there is a combination of the signs to enhance the total magnitude of @xmath358 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the sign is opposite , @xmath361 , one can expect a cancellation between the valence quark and meson cloud effects , leading to a result @xmath362 , or to a magnitude similar to @xmath356 .",
    "an example of a quark model with @xmath363 can be found in refs .",
    "note that in case @xmath361 , the reaction @xmath8 has similar properties with the reaction @xmath20 , discussed previously .",
    "this result suggests that the experimental determination of the sign for @xmath358 is very important to pin down the relative phase between the @xmath6 and @xmath7 wave functions in the present model as we explain next .    from the discussions above , we conclude that , if @xmath364 , it is expected that @xmath358 becomes larger in magnitude . in the alternative case , @xmath361 , @xmath358 should be smaller in magnitude , and comparable with @xmath356 .",
    "therefore , once the sign @xmath41 is known , @xmath42 can be inferred from the result for @xmath358 .",
    "note also that in our model @xmath41 can be fixed by the results for the reaction @xmath19 , since valence quark effect dominates that transition ( @xmath365 ) .",
    "then @xmath19 can be used to determine @xmath42 , which fixes also the sign of @xmath366 .",
    "the covariant spectator quark model can also be used to calculate the valence quark contributions for the @xmath159 form factors in general and the transition magnetic moment @xmath172 in particular . assuming that the valence quark effect is the leading contribution as demonstrated reasonable for the octet baryon system  @xcite",
    ", one can conclude that @xmath367  @xcite , namely , the sign of @xmath366 is the opposite to that of @xmath42 .",
    "thus , once determined the sign of @xmath42 corresponding to the reaction @xmath8 , we can determine the sign of @xmath172 .    for completeness",
    ", we also present in fig .",
    "[ fighelicities ] the results for the helicity amplitudes @xmath62 and @xmath63 converted from @xmath243 and @xmath244 by eqs .",
    "( [ eqa12x ] ) and  ( [ eqs12x ] ) , assuming the same phases as the form factors helicity amplitude shown in ref .",
    "@xcite has a different absolute phase from the present work . ] . for the @xmath19 reaction we can also observe the dominance of the valence quark contributions over the meson cloud contributions . as for the @xmath8 reaction ,",
    "the more interesting point is the closeness of the valence and meson cloud contributions for the @xmath368 amplitude .",
    "also in this case we can conclude that if @xmath369 , @xmath368 is enhanced , while the alternative case , @xmath370 , we expect a substantial reduction of the @xmath368 amplitude .",
    "the similarity in the behavior for @xmath368 and @xmath358 , as discussed before , is a consequence of the partial suppression of the @xmath32 contribution for the @xmath368 amplitude , due to the factor @xmath371 .",
    "another interesting point in fig .",
    "[ fighelicities ] is the flatness of the valence quark model result for @xmath62 as a function of @xmath36 around the region @xmath372 gev@xmath190 .",
    "this is because the region @xmath372 gev@xmath190 is the turning point of changing the @xmath36 dependence in the amplitude . for the larger @xmath36 region",
    "however , the expected falloff with the @xmath36 can be observed .",
    "in this study we have analyzed the contributions from the valence quark and meson cloud effects for the @xmath373 reactions with @xmath374 and @xmath375 .",
    "while the valence quark contributions are estimated using a constituent quark model  @xcite , those of the meson cloud are estimated using the chiral unitary model  @xcite . in the chiral unitary model",
    ", the @xmath347 has some components other than meson - baryon dynamics as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , but for the calculation of the transition form factors we take only coupling of the photon current to the meson component and do not take into account of photon couplings to genuine quark components . in this approach",
    "the @xmath29 is almost composed of meson - baryon components  @xcite . since the valence and meson cloud effects are calculated by the different formalisms we can not simply combine the both contributions to obtain the final , total results for the transition form factors",
    "nevertheless , the magnitude and signs of the individual contributions presented here are sufficient to conclude that it is possible to have a cancellation from the two effects , the valence quark and meson cloud effects , in a consistent , unified approach including the both effects .    for the @xmath20 reaction",
    ", we have found difference in signs for the two contributions for the pauli - type form factor @xmath33 , which can be the main reason for the experimental observation , @xmath296 for @xmath376 gev@xmath190 .    as for the reactions @xmath377 ( @xmath1 ) , we conclude that generally the valence quark contributions dominate for the @xmath37 case , but",
    "the two contributions are similar for the reaction with @xmath5 .",
    "a particularly interesting case is the form factor @xmath358 .",
    "namely , if we assume the same sign for the @xmath6 and @xmath11 radial wave function normalization constants ( @xmath304 ) and @xmath110 , we have an enhancement for @xmath358 . instead ,",
    "if we assume @xmath370 , we have a substantial cancellation between the two effects .",
    "then , the @xmath358 contribution for the reaction cross section would be very small .",
    "a consequence of the observation made above is that the @xmath8 reaction can provide an indirect method to determine @xmath42 , which can be used to pin down the sign of @xmath172 consistently within the present approach .",
    "this can be of fundamental importance , because the sign of the @xmath159 transition form factors , and in particular the sign of the transition magnetic moment , @xmath366 , is not determined experimentally .",
    "also this sign has not been related consistently with the other reactions so far .",
    "although the sign is predicted to be negative within the unitary symmetry approach  @xcite ( the same sign with the neutron magnetic moment ) , the consistency with other reaction was not studied within the approach .    from the discussion made above",
    "we conclude that the theoretical and experimental studies of the reactions @xmath20 and @xmath0 , with @xmath1 , as well as the correlations between them , are very interesting topics of investigation .",
    "the results from these transition form factors can be used to estimate the light and strange quark distributions in the baryons , as well as to predict other reactions .",
