    "an electronic phase transition from a metallic to an insulating state exclusively driven by electron - electron interaction is called a mott - hubbard transition@xcite .",

    "it has always been attracting a lot of interest because of its intriguing temperature - doping phase diagram @xcite shown in fig .",
    "the pure compound undergoes a first order metal - insulator transition ( mit ) from a paramagnetic metallic ( pm ) to a low - temperature antiferromagnetic insulating phase ( afi ) around t@xmath5=160 k with a seven orders of magnitude resistivity jump .",
    "this first order transition is accompanied by a crystal symmetry change from a corundum to a monoclinic structure .",
    "as soon as one slightly dopes the compound with chromium ( from 0.5% to 1.7% cr concentration ) a new paramagnetic insulating phase ( pi ) appears , having the same corundum structure but slightly different lattice parameters @xcite .",
    "the pm - pi transition is thus considered the prototype of the mott - hubbard transition , without any structural modification and/or magnetic ordering , but only driven by electron - electron interaction .",
    "the first order transition line presents a large temperature hysteresis ending at a second order critical point @xcite . above 400 k ,",
    "a poor conducting regime is established , in which the single - particle spectral weight near the fermi energy progressively disappears and the drude peak is depleted in the low - energy optical conductivity @xcite . replacing vanadium with titanium , the nel temperature @xmath6 monotonously decreases and above a 5%ti - content the afi monoclinic phase is completely suppressed .",
    "the system becomes a metal with a corundum structure at all temperatures .    from the theoretical point of view , the mechanism that underlies",
    "the mott - hubbard mit has longly been explained with a half - filled single band hubbard model , in which the coulomb parameter _",

    "after that , many - body models leading to a triplet state @xmath11=1 were formulated combining local density approximation ( lda ) with the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) @xcite .",
    "lda+dmft calculations also succeeded in predicting a very important feature of v 3__d _ _ spectral function @xcite , i.e. the quasiparticle ( qp ) peak at the fermi energy in the pm phase , which was later observed by photoemission spectroscopy@xcite .    despite intensive experimental and theoretical efforts @xcite , many properties of this compound still remain elusive .",

    "2 ) is due to a microscopic phase separation occurring in 0.011 cr - doped system across the mit that will be discussed in sec .",
    "iii - d .    in the pure compound , on crossing the nel temperature , a filling of the mott - hubbard gap",
    "is induced ( see also section iii - e ) . this filling results , below 1 ev , in a metallic absorption associated with the appearance of quasiparticles at @xmath24 , in good agreement with what is observed in resistivity , specific heat @xcite , and photoemission @xcite measurements .",
    "as the temperature increases , @xmath15 presents a strong temperature dependence , with a huge transfer of spectral weight from low to high frequency through an isosbestic point at about 6000 @xmath14 . for t=500 k ( orange line )",
    "the pure sample is in the crossover region ( see the phase diagram in fig .",
    "1 ) , where the optical spectrum shows a low - frequency depletion in @xmath15 , due to the progressive disappearance of quasiparticles at @xmath24 @xcite ( see section iii - e ) .      according to well established band calculations , optical spectroscopy probes the v - v transitions up to 3.5 ev , while the v - o hopping occurs at higher energies @xcite .",
    "all the v 3__d _ _ optical absorption bands are explained in terms of transitions over a multi - orbital density of states@xcite .",
    "the emerging drude response when going from the afi to the pm phase is then the result of a quasiparticle peak forming at the fermi level at the expense of the hubbard bands , separated by an energy u. in particular , both the @xmath9 and the @xmath8 bands participate , in agreement with lda+dmft calculations @xcite , to the formation of the qp peak at e@xmath25 with different energy distribution and weight @xcite .",
    "together with the drude term , transitions in the mid - infrared range are expected either from the lower hubbard band to the quasiparticle peak , or from the qp peak to the upper hubbard band . due to the corundum crystal structure of v@xmath0o@xmath1",
    ", one might expect an anisotropic electrodynamic response . specifically , a different drude response along the @xmath26-axis and the @xmath12-plane and , in principle , two absorption bands in the mid - infrared located at different characteristic energies . although most of transport measurements in the pm phase have been performed along the @xmath12 hexagonal plane , the very few @xmath26-axis dc transport data present in literature show @xcite an anisotropy on the order of 5@xmath27 , with the @xmath26-axis more conductive than the @xmath12-plane .",

    "a high - frequency absorption reminiscent of an incoherent hubbard transition , which will be discussed more properly in section e , is still present above 10000 @xmath14 . as @xmath15 in both crystals",
    "has been measured along the @xmath12 hexagonal plane , these spectral features should be mainly related to the @xmath9 orbitals , which are oriented along this plane . the whole infrared conductivity for both systems increases by reducing t through a transfer of spectral weight from the high - frequency incoherent transitions .",
    "this indicates that coherent transport develops at low temperature , yielding a better metallic state .    in order to compare more quantitatively the pm electrodynamics of both crystals ,",
    "we have fitted @xmath15 at 200 k through a multi - component drude - lorentz ( d - l ) model including the drude term , and three lorentz peaks : the stretching phonon around 500 @xmath14 , a mir band and the hubbard band .",
    "the complex optical conductivity is written as : @xmath28 in the drude term @xmath29 is the plasma frequency and @xmath30 is the scattering time .",

[",
    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    from the fitting results one can estimate the ratio of the in - gap spectral weight ( drude+mir band ) between pure and ti - doped crystals .",
    "this ratio ( which is basically indipendent of temperature ) is nearly 1.1 indicating that a slight reduction of metallicity is induced by ti - substitution .",
    "as v presents a @xmath36@xmath37 electronic configuration while ti has only two electrons in the 3@xmath4 orbitals ( @xmath38@xmath37 ) , this suggests that titanium acts like an electronic acceptor adding x(ti ) holes in the crystal .",
    "starting from the formula unit ( v@xmath2ti@xmath3)@xmath0o@xmath1 this corresponds to an electron density ratio 1.05 for x(ti)=0.045 , in good agreement with the experimental value 1.1 determined above .    from the fitting parameters reported in table",
    "i one can also calculate for each sample the spectral weight ratio @xcite :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) is the intensity of the drude component while @xmath42 also contains the mir contribution to the optical conductivity .",
    "this quantity , obtained from the experimental data , provides an estimate of the degree of electronic correlation of any material @xcite .",
    "when @xmath43 is close to zero this means that the electron - electron correlations are strongly renormalizing the coherent spectral weight ; for @xmath43@xmath441 , one approaches a conventional metallic case like gold and silver @xcite . at 200",
    "k , @xmath45@xmath220.18 for the pure sample .",
    "this indicates that v@xmath0o@xmath1 is a strongly correlated metal , where electron - electron repulsion hugely renormalizes the quasiparticle spectral weight in favor of the mid - ir incoherent part . in v@xmath0o@xmath1 films",
    "@xcite containing both contributions from the @xmath12-plane and @xmath26-axis , the same ratio at 200 k is 0.12 in quite good agreement with our estimate . in the ti - doped system @xmath43@xmath220.28 pointing out that although correlations still play a strong role , their effect is reduced with respect to pure v@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "this last result can be better understood in terms of ti - doping effect previously discussed .",
    "indeed , ti acting like an acceptor , displaces v@xmath0o@xmath1 from the half filling state and this naturally implies that the effects of electronic correlations are reduced .",
    "it is also worth noticing that the pm optical conductivity of ( v@xmath2cr@xmath3)@xmath0o@xmath1 with x(cr)=0.011 ( see fig .",
    "3 , bottom panel ) does not show a metallic behavior .",
    "indeed its pm conductivity at 220 k shows a strong mir absorption looking very similar to that of pure v@xmath0o@xmath1 material , without the presence of a low - frequency drude term .",
    "this drastic depletion of the drude is due to the proximity with the mott transition ( see the introduction section ) , and in the next section we will see that a mesoscopic electronic phase separation strongly influences the properties of this sample .          in this section",
    "we focus on the first order transition from a paramagnetic insulating to a paramagnetic metallic phase that happens in doped compounds with a chromium percentage varying from 0.5% to 1.7% .",
    "in particular , the mit in the 1.1% sample occurs at @xmath22 260 k upon cooling ; upon heating thereafter the sample , the pm phase remains stable up to 275 k , and the pi phase is fully recovered only for temperatures above 300 k. the optical conductivity , for light polarization along the @xmath12 plane at 220 k , is shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "3 . in contrast with the pure compound in the same macroscopic pm phase ( see the same panel ) , the doped compound shows a depletion of the drude response and a lower dc value : @xmath46@xmath22250 @xmath23@xmath14 to be compared to @xmath47@xmath223500 @xmath23@xmath14 .",
    "the absence of a metallic contribution in the optical spectra of the 1.1% sample is at variance with photoemission measurements recently achieved on crystals from the same batch .",
    "indeed , photoemission data show , when performed with sufficient bulk sensitivity , a clear metallic quasiparticle peak @xcite . in order to clarify these apparently contradictory results",
    ", we performed a scanning photoemission microscopy ( spem ) experiment with sub - micrometric spatial resolution .",
    "photons at 27 ev were focused through a schwarzschild objective , to obtain a submicron size spot .",
    "the measurements were performed in ultra - high vacuum ( p@xmath48@xmath49 mbar ) on well oriented @xmath12 surfaces of ( v@xmath50cr@xmath51)@xmath0o@xmath1 prepared _ in situ_. photoelectrons were collected at an emission angle of 65 degrees from the normal , which makes the photoemission spectra and images surface sensitive .",
    "a standard procedure was used to remove topographic features from the images presented in fig .",
    "[ fig4]a , b , and to obtain an unambiguous contrast between metallic and insulating regions @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the spectral intensity at the fermi level e@xmath25 , which is high in the pm phase and absent in the pi phase , was divided by the v 3__d__-band intensity . as this latter is essentially constant in the pi and pm phases , two - dimensional maps of this ratio",
    "provide a genuine representation of the lateral variation of metallic and insulating domains .",
    "the sub - micrometric maps of the photoelectron yield at @xmath24 @xcite are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig4]a , b together with their representative photoemission spectra at 220 k ( pm phase ) and 320 k ( pi phase ) . it should be pointed out that our experimental geometry @xcite and photon energy ( 27 ev ) did not allow the collection of sufficiently bulk sensitive photoelectron spectra .",
    "thus the spectra corresponding to the metallic phase do not show an evident quasiparticle peak .",
    "nevertheless , the difference between insulating and metallic phases is unambiguous . within these maps",
    "we can resolve metallic ( yellow zones ) , and insulating domains ( blue zones ) , which appear for @xmath52 and persist in the pm phase .",
    "a uniform insulating behavior is found in the pi phase , showing that the pm state only is strongly phase separated .",
    "moreover , when the sample is further cooled down , the metallic and insulating domains are still found in the same sample position and with a similar shape @xcite .",
    "this memory effect clearly shows that mesoscopic domains form around specific points in the sample , for instance around dopant cr ions @xcite .",
    "these nucleation centers can be related to structural inhomogeneites in the material and then have an extrinsic origin .",
    "however , the tendency towards the electronic phase separation is an intrinsic phenomenon associated with the correlation energy providing the thermodynamic instability in the vicinity of the mott transition .    to the electronic phase separation in the pm phase , as observed by spem",
    ", it also corresponds a structural phase separation .",
    "in fact , the structure of ( v@xmath50cr@xmath51)@xmath0o@xmath1 in the pm phase has been described in terms of a coexistence of an @xmath53-phase , with lattice parameters close to those of metallic v@xmath0o@xmath1 at 400 k , and a @xmath54-phase with basically the same structure as at higher cr content @xcite .",
    "spem and structural data therefore provide a much deeper understanding of the poor metallic behavior in the pm phase of ( v@xmath50cr@xmath51)@xmath0o@xmath1 , as shown by the pseudo - gap low - frequency behavior of the optical conductivity ( see fig . [ fig3 ] ) . in an inhomogeneous ( two - phases )",
    "system investigated with an electromagnetic field having wavelengths larger than the mesoscopic domain sizes , the dielectric properties can be described through an effective medium approximation ( ema ) . in this case",

    "an insulating phase , corresponding to the blue color in the photoemission map , and a metallic phase corresponding to the yellow color .",
    "the broad minimum between these two components corresponds to areas where metallic and insulating regions are too small to be resolved with our spatial resolution .",
    "furthermore , the pm histogram can be fitted by a sum of two gaussian curves ( dashed line ) , whose relative intensities provide the insulating and metallic volume fractions .",
    "the fit gives @xmath61=0.45@xmath620.05 ( @xmath63=0.55@xmath620.05 ) for the metallic ( insulating ) component ( @xmath61+@xmath63=1 ) .",
    "remarkably , at 320 k one gaussian ( corresponding to the insulating phase ) is sufficient to fit the intensity distribution histogram ( fig .",

    "this dependence can be explained already in a tight - binding approach through the sommerfeld expansion of the kinetic energy , which is proportional to the optical spectral weight . while in conventional metals a nearly complete spectral weigth recovering at any t is achieved if @xmath85 , resulting in a vanishingly small @xmath86 , electronic correlations strongly renormalize both @xmath82 and @xmath87 .",
    "therefore , the parameter @xmath88b(@xmath89/@xmath90(@xmath79 ) can be used to compare the degree of electronic correlation in different systems @xcite . from the fit of sw @xmath73 t in fig .",
    "5a we estimate @xmath9110@xmath92k@xmath93 .",
    "this value is comparable to that of nd@xmath94tio@xmath1@xcite ( 2.2@xmath9510@xmath92k@xmath93 ) , sizably larger ( nearly a factor 100 ) than a conventional metal like gold@xcite ( 1.3@xmath9510@xmath96k@xmath93 ) and vo@xmath0 ( this paper , 2.5@xmath9510@xmath96k@xmath93 ) and also larger than other correlated materials like la@xmath97sr@xmath98cuo@xmath99 @xcite ( 4.5 @xmath9510@xmath100k@xmath93 ) , bi@xmath0sr@xmath101la@xmath102cuo@xmath103 @xcite ( 2.5@xmath9510@xmath100k@xmath93 ) , lanio@xmath1 ( this paper , 3.2@xmath9510@xmath100k@xmath93 ) .",
    "as discussed in section iii - b , the degree of electronic correlation is currently estimated in literature through the ratio @xmath43 @xcite , where @xmath40 is the spectral weight of the drude component while @xmath42 also contains the mir contribution to the optical conductivity .",
    "indeed , electronic correlations reduce , at a fixed t , the coherence of qps transferring part of their sw from the drude term to a mir band . moreover",
    ", electronic correlations also increase the temperature dependence of sw with respect to a non - correlated system .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to compare these two aspects of electronic correlations in different materials . in fig .",
    "we represent a correlation diagram between the parameter @xmath104 and @xmath43 for v@xmath0o@xmath1 and the other materials previously discussed .",
    "a strong reduction of the drude coherent spectral weight in favor of the incoherent mir band , i.e. a low value of the @xmath43 ratio clearly corresponds to a strong transfer of sw vs.t as indicated by a large value of @xmath104 . in v@xmath0o@xmath1 @xmath43",
    "is minimized and @xmath104 is maximized suggesting that very strong correlations play a fundamental role in any temperature region of the phase diagram . a similar behavior can be observed in nd@xmath94tio@xmath1 , where the effect of correlations are even more pronounced .    on the other hand , the position of vo@xmath0 in the correlation diagram suggests that electronic correlations do not play a strong role in both the temperature dependence of the spectral weigth and in the coherent / incoherent spectral weigth ratio .",
    "therefore , it is hard to say that the main driven force of the mit in vo@xmath0 is the hubbard mechanism . finally ,",
    "the absence of electronic correlations in gold reflects in a very weak t dependence of the sw , @xmath105 in a very small @xmath104 value , and in an optical conductivity that can be described in terms of a pure drude component .",
    "the afi optical conductivities at 100 k for pure and cr - doped systems and at 10 k for the ti - doped crystal are plotted in the upper panel of fig .",
    "an optical gap can be observed in pure v@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "a slight cr - doping ( 1.1 % ) unexpectedly generates a strong collapse of the gap which nearly reduces by a factor of two .",
    "moreover , a broad peak appears around 8000 @xmath14 extending smoothly at higher energy .",
    "this peak can be better highlighted by subtracting the pure sample curve from the 1.1 % data as shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "an increasing cr - doping does not further change the afi gap as observed by the difference @xmath106-@xmath107 .",
    "such a strong reduction of the afi gap @xmath73 the cr content is at variance with the smooth variation of the nel temperature which sligthly increases from 160 k for x=0 to nearly 180 k for any cr - doping .",
    "a similar gap collapse has also been measured by rozenberg _ _ et al.__@xcite in a v@xmath108o@xmath1 single crystal with y=1.3% of vanadium vacancies ( dashed line in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) where t@xmath109 reduces to @xmath1650 k.    o@xmath1 in its antiferromagnetic insulating phase for various dopings .",
    "the dashed curve corresponds to a oxygen - vacant crystal ( ref . ) .",
    "bottom panel : a strong reduction of the afi optical gap can be observed in both cr- and ti - doping as highlighted by subtracting the pure sample curve from the cr- and ti - data.,width=321 ]    the effect of ti - doping is even more robust .",
    "the afi gap , well visible in pure and cr - doped materials basically disappears in favor of a flat electronic background which extends from the mid - ir to the visible range . only in the far - ir",
    "one can observe a small gap on the order of 300 @xmath14 which smoothly interpolates to a dc conductivity of about 30 @xmath23@xmath14 ( solid black diamond , see fig .",
    "this mirrors a huge transfer of spectral weight towards low - frequency as indicated by the difference @xmath110-@xmath111 .",
    "although little is known about the af order in the ti - doping region , at the actual doping level ( x(ti)=0.045 ) t@xmath5 interestingly has a still finite value of about 60 k , comparable to that of v@xmath108o@xmath1 ( y=1.3% ) .",
    "although a theoretical calculation would be necessary to quantitatively explain all features related to the afi transition in the whole phase diagram , the behavior of the optical conductivity can be qualitatively understood from the effects of cr and ti incorporation in the lattice in a general lda perspective .",
    "indeed , the afi phase is characterized by a monoclinic i2/a symmetry , whose lattice parameters are @xmath112 = 7.255  , @xmath113 = 5.002  , @xmath114 = 5.548  , and a monoclinic angle @xmath54= 96.752 degrees . as a consequence , both the vertical and the horizontal v - v bond lengths increase determining a finite increase in the lattice volume compared to the corundum structure .",
    "the monoclinic bond lengths are basically constant over the whole phase diagram , suggesting that the different behavior of the optical conductivity across the transition should be deduced from the different properties of the metallic / insulating phase above t@xmath5 .",
    "ti substitution plays a double role .",
    "the incorporation of ti into v@xmath0o@xmath1 results in a compression of the corundum lattice @xcite .",
    "this suggests a reduction of the @xmath115 ratio @xmath105 an increase of the density of states at the fermi energy .",
    "this is also in agreement with the fact that ti@xmath0o@xmath1 is metallic at all temperatures .",
    "however , a larger density of states at @xmath24 is partially reduced by the fact that ti acts like an acceptor ( see discussion in section iii.b ) , thus determining a smaller electron density with respect to that of pure v@xmath0o@xmath1 ( 2 electrons @xmath116 atom ) in its metallic phase . both effects",
    "then qualitatively suggest a less drastic metal - insulator transition at t@xmath5 , with an antiferromagnetic phase having both a small gap and a strongly renormalized nel temperature .",
    "this is also confirmed by the reduction of the jump of resistivity at t@xmath5 in the ti - doped sample .",
    "however , we can not exclude the presence of an electronic phase separation , although the well evident metallic aspect of the optical conductivity for t@xmath70t@xmath5 seems to indicate , at variance with cr - doped 0.01 crystal , that metallic domains are predominant over the insulating ones .",
    "this calls for further spem measurements to investigate this interesting point .",
    "cr substitution also plays a double role .",
    "the incorporation of cr into v@xmath0o@xmath1 results in an expansion of the corundum lattice @xcite .",
    "in particular , the expansion determines an increase of the crystal field splitting and a reduction of both the hopping @xmath8-@xmath8 integral and the @xmath8-@xmath117 hybridization energy .",
    "these changes in the lda parameters @xcite have been suggested to be significant to drive the metal - insulator transition as explained in ref . .",
    "moreover , given the @xmath118@xmath119 cr electronic state , this corresponds to an electron doping with respect to the half - filling configuration of pure v@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "both effects correspond to a weak , scarcely cr - dependent , insulating pi phase ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , with a small insulating gap of about 1000 @xmath14 . starting from this weak insulating state , the af - monoclinic phase transition further gaps the optical conductivity but , at variance with pure v@xmath0o@xmath1 , where the half - filling condition favors a large gap , here a smaller gap opens in the afi phase with an absorption maximum at about 8000 @xmath14 .",
    "in this paper we have discussed the optical properties of the archetypal correlated material v@xmath0o@xmath1 in all regions of its phase diagram . from a drude - lorentz fit",
    "we find that titanium acts like an electronic acceptor putting x(ti ) holes in the crystal , and thus reducing the metallicity of the sample .",
    "chromium doping instead induces a phase coexistence with percolative insulating domains , thus drastically lowering the dc conductivity , compared to the pure material .",
    "we have also drawn important information from the high temperature crossover regime , where a depletion in the optical conductivity is formed and the sample shows a `` poor metal '' behavior .",
    "we have estimated the degree of correlation by utilizing the temperature dependence of the spectral weight .",
    "this method gives results in good agreement with previously proposed estimations providing vanadium sesquioxide to be classified as a very strongly correlated material .",
    "furthermore we discuss for the first time the antiferromagnetic insulating gap magnitude , and we compare it among the various doped samples .",
    "the cr - doped compound shows half the gap of the pure compound due to lattice parameters modification and to the actual electron doping strongly modifying the band structure .",
    "this study thus provides a new comprehensive scenario of the mott - hubbard physics in v@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
