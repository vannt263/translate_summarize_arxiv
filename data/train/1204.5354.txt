    "understanding when and how the most massive galaxies in the universe formed is one of the most outstanding problems in cosmology and galaxy formation ( conselice 2007 ) .",
    "a number of observations suggest that the era of @xmath3 is important in galaxy formation and evolution for various reasons : the cosmic star formation rate ( sfr ) density begins to drop at @xmath3 from a flat plateau at higher redshifts ; the morphological type mix of field galaxies changes remarkably at @xmath3 ; the number density of qsos has a peak at @xmath3 ; @xmath12 of the stellar mass assembly of galaxies took place in the redshift range @xmath13 ( dickinson 2003 ; fontana 2003 ; steidel 2004 ; kong 2006 ; richards 2006 ; arnouts 2007 ; pozzetti 2007 ; noeske 2007 ) .",
    "however , in the redshift range @xmath14 , identifiable spectral features such as h&k and the 4000  break ( for passive galaxies ) and [ ] @xmath15 , [ ] @xmath16 , h@xmath17 ,  and h@xmath18  ( for star - forming ones ) move out of the optical bands , thus near - infrared imaging and spectroscopy become essential .",
    "on the other hand , near - infrared galaxy samples offer several advantages compared to purely optical selections ( cowie 1994 ) .",
    "they allow us to select galaxies at @xmath19 in the rest - frame optical , correspond more closely to a stellar - mass - selected sample , and are less prone to dust extinction .",
    "there are many ways of using optical and infrared ( ir ) colors to select the sample of galaxies at @xmath3 .",
    "a sample of ir - luminous dust - obscured galaxies ( dogs ) , with a median @xmath20 , selected to have very red @xmath21 $ ] color , was recently presented by dey ( 2008 ) . from spectroscopic observations dogs",
    "were found to have a tight redshift distribution around @xmath3 , very similar to that of the submillimeter - selected galaxies ( chapman 2005 ) .",
    "another different sample , based on near - infrared color selection , is that distant red galaxies with @xmath22 ( drgs ; franx 2003 ; van dokkum 2004 ) .",
    "these sources are redder and strong clustering and are believed to be more massive than @xmath23 ( labbe 2005 ; papovich 2006 ; van dokkum 2006 ; quadri 2008 ) . a third sample uses _",
    "spitzer_/irac color to select galaxies at @xmath24 . in the redshift range @xmath25 , the four irac bands",
    "probe the rest - frame near - infrared bands where galaxy spectral energy distributions ( seds ) have similar shape , thus the irac colors are very robust in determining redshift in this range ( farrah 2008 ; desai 2009 ; huang 2009 ; fadda 2010 ; fiolet 2010 ; fang 2011 ) .",
    "most sources of these samples are starburst - dominated ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ; @xmath26 ) , with an apparent 1.6  stellar bump in the irac channels .    an independent way to select galaxies at @xmath3 is to use @xmath27 colors .",
    "daddi ( 2004 ) introduced a new photometric technique , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , for obtaining a virtually complete sample of star - forming ( @xmath30 ) and passively evolving galaxies ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) at @xmath33 .",
    "these criteria are reddening independent for star - forming galaxies in the selected redshift range , thus can be used to select the reddest dust - extinguished galaxies .",
    "this should allow a relatively unbiased selection of star - forming ( ) and passively evolving galaxies ( ) at @xmath3 within the magnitude limit of the sample studied . based on @xmath34 photometry from subaru and new technology telescope ( ntt ) over two separate fields , using the @xmath27 technique , kong ( 2006 )",
    "have obtained a sample of @xmath35  and @xmath36 , which were identified over an area of @xmath37 arcmin@xmath38 to @xmath39 , of which 320 arcmin@xmath38 are complete to @xmath40 .",
    "they found that the log of the number counts of  flattens out by @xmath41 .",
    "similar conclusions were also found by lane ( 2007 ) and mccracken ( 2010 ) , with much larger samples .",
    "investigations of the physical properties ( i.e. , stellar mass , luminosity , size , clustering , sfr , morphology , etc . ) of various types of galaxies from high to low redshift are required for better understanding the history of the galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "dunne ( 2009 ) studied the star formation history of _ k_-selected galaxies in the ukidss ultra - deep survey .",
    "they found that the specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) for _ k_-selected sources rises strongly with redshift at all stellar masses . in the same field , williams ( 2009 , 2010 ) investigated the physical properties ( including clustering , size , stellar mass , surface density , sfr , color , etc . ) of quiescent and star - forming galaxy populations to @xmath4202 with pure photometric data , employing a novel rest - frame @xmath43 versus @xmath44 technique ( wuyts 2007 ; wolf 2009 ; balogh 2009 ; whitaker 2010 ; patel 2011 ) .",
    "as shown in figure 8 of williams ( 2009 ) and figure 2 of brammer ( 2011 ) , the red quiescent and star - forming galaxies are found to occupy two distinct population in the rest - frame @xmath43 versus @xmath44 color space .",
    "this bimodal behavior is still seen up to @xmath3 .",
    "at all redshifts , furthermore , massive quiescent galaxies occupy the extreme high end of the surface density distribution and a tight mass  size correlation , while star - forming show a broad range of both densities and sizes . on the other hand , the sizes and surface densities of massive quiescent and star - forming galaxies evolve as simple power - law behavior in ( @xmath45 ) , with more massive galaxies exhibiting faster evolution . in the meantime , brammer ( 2009 , 2011 ) , van dokkum ( 2010 ) , and whitaker ( 2011 ) provided further evidence for the results above , using the sample from the newfirm medium band survey ( nmbs ; van dokkum 2009 ) .",
    "more studies for the _ k_-selected galaxies have been performed up to @xmath46 ( cimatti 2002 ; abraham 2004 ; drory 2005 , 2009 ; fontana 2006 ; pozzetti 2007 ; prez - gonzlez 2008 ; furusawa 2011 ) .",
    "morphologies are also essential in studying galaxy mass assembly history and evolution . for the morphologies of galaxies at @xmath3 , the traditional hubble sequence of regular spirals and elliptical galaxies",
    "has not settled into place by @xmath3 , and a much higher frequency of diffuse , clumpy , and irregular structures is observed among star - forming systems ( lotz 2006 ; szomoru 2011 ) . with the advent of _ hubble space telescope _",
    "_ hst_/wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) , it is now possible to obtain a complete rest - frame optical morphological census for massive galaxies at @xmath3 .",
    "understanding the nature of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and the galaxies that host them is important for such diverse goals as pinpointing the sources of the cosmic x - ray and ir backgrounds and deriving the star formation history of the universe .",
    "multi - wavelength surveys are particularly important for the study of agns because their appearance in different wavelength regimes can be quite different . in this work",
    ", we will discuss the fraction of agns in our sample by using the irac band color criteria of stern ( 2005 ) and mid - ir spectral index ( barmby 2006 ; park 2010 ) .",
    "to study the physical properties of galaxies in the redshift range @xmath47 , in this paper , we select a sample of passively evolving and star - forming galaxies to @xmath48 in the all - wavelength extended groth strip international survey ( aegis ) data set .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe the multi - band spatial- and ground - based observations of the aegis field , and introduce data reduction , photometric redshifts , and method for galaxy sample selection in section 2 .",
    "section 3 presents source number counts (  and ) .",

    "section 6 discusses the fraction of agns in our galaxy sample .",
    "finally , a brief summary is presented in section 7 .",
    "all magnitudes and colors are in the ab system unless stated otherwise . throughout the paper",
    "we adopt the following cosmology : @xmath49[km s@xmath50 mpc@xmath50]@xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "the aegis is a collaborative effort to obtain both deep imaging covering all major wavebands from x - ray to radio and optical spectroscopy over a large area of sky ( @xmath55deg@xmath38 ) with the aim of studying the panchromatic properties of galaxies over the last half of the hubble time .",
    "aegis is targeted on a special area of the sky , called the extended groth strip ( egs ; centered at @xmath17(j2000)@xmath56 , @xmath57(j2000)@xmath58 ) , which has low - extinction , low - galactic , and zodiacal infrared emission , has good schedulability by space - based observations , and has therefore attracted a wide range of deep observations at essentially every accessible wavelength over this comparatively wide field ( davis 2007 ) .",
    "the egs is a public deep multi - wavelength survey ; this field provides an unique combination of area and depth at almost every waveband observable . in this paper , _ chandra_/acis x - ray , cfht /",

    "specially , the _ chandra_/acis dr2 catalog presented by laird et al.(2009 ) is used .",
    "the x - ray data reduction was performed using the ciao data analysis software version 3.3 .",
    "basic data reduction proceeded in a manner similar to that described by nandra ( 2005 ) .",
    "the vast majority of x - ray sources detected in the egs field are agns . in the meantime , the egs is also one of four @xmath59deg@xmath38 fields covered by the cfhtls deep survey ( labeled cfhtls - d3 ) .",

    "a catalog of objects with redshifts known from spectroscopic observations is very important to the construction of a photometric redshift code .",
    "for this reason , we use the deep2 ( deep extragalactic evolutionary probe ) spectroscopic data obtained with the deep imaging multi - object spectrograph boarded on the keck 10 m telescope .",
    "the deep2-dr3 redshift catalog structures contain 24 tags for each object with 50,386 entries in the entire catalog .",
    "for the egs field ( deep2-field1 ) , we only consider objects with redshift quality greater than or equal to 3 .",
    "to specifically study the accuracy of the photometric redshift , we also adopt spectroscopic redshifts drawn from the lyman break galaxy ( lbg ; @xmath88 ) catalog of steidel ( 2003 ) and from a small sample of ulirgs ( @xmath3 ) presented in huang ( 2009 ) and fang ( 2011 ) .",
    "the nmbs employs a new technique of using medium - bandwidth near - infrared filters to sample the balmer/4000  break from @xmath89 at a higher resolution than the standard broadband near - infrared filters ( van dokkum 2009 ) , thereby improving the accuracy of photometric redshifts .",

    "[ fig : sfrm](d ) , we overplot the correlation between the sfr and stellar mass for @xmath149 galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; brinchmann 2004 ) , @xmath150 and @xmath3 galaxies in the goods ( elbaz 2007 ; daddi 2007 ) , and @xmath151 and @xmath150 from millennium model ( kitzbichler & white 2007 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : sfrm](d ) shows the slopes between the sfr and stellar mass of galaxies at different redshifts are very similar . on average ,",
    "the sfr of galaxies on the sfr@xmath146 diagram increases with redshift at a fixed @xmath132 , by a factor about 6 from @xmath152 to @xmath153 , and a factor about 20 from @xmath152 to @xmath154 . at fixed stellar mass ,",
    "star - forming galaxies were much more active on average in the past .",
    "this is most likely due to a larger abundance of gas , depleted with passing of time ( daddi 2007 ) .",
    "the millennium model overlaps very well with the sdss at @xmath155 and predicts a slope very similar to the observed trend at different redshift bins . for @xmath153 , however , we find that at fixed stellar masses the model predicts an increase of the sfr much below the observed trend .",
    "it seems that a major change required for models would be to increase the star formation efficiency ( and thus the typical sfr ) at all masses for star - forming galaxies at redshifts @xmath19 .",
    "ssfr is defined as the ratio of the current sfr to the current stellar mass , ssfr = sfr@xmath133 .",
    "thus , higher values of the ssfr indicate that a larger fraction of stars were formed recently , and it can be used to characterize the star formation history of galaxies .    figure  [ fig : ssfrm ] shows the ssfr as a function of stellar mass for the  in our sample , with the same four redshift bins as in figure  [ fig : sfrm ] .",
    "the dashed lines in each panel represent a good fit between the ssfr and @xmath132 for galaxies with @xmath148 . in figure",
    "[ fig : ssfrm](d ) , we overplot the correlation between the ssfr and stellar mass for @xmath156 , @xmath157 , and @xmath158 galaxies in brinchmann & ellis ( 2000 ) .    from this figure , we find that the general shape of ssfr@xmath146 correlation is in good agreement with a similar study for @xmath128 galaxies ( brinchmann & ellis 2000 ) , and the line of maximum ssfr runs parallel to lines of constant sfr .",
    "furthermore , this ssfr is generally increasing with increasing redshift for all stellar masses , suggesting that star formation contributes more to the growth of low - mass galaxies than to the growth of high - mass galaxies .",
    "finally , the most massive galaxies have the lowest ssfr at redshift @xmath159 ; they formed their stars earlier and more rapidly than their low - mass counterparts .",
    "this is in agreement with the downsizing scenario .",
    "the morphology of a galaxy reflects its dynamical history and evolution .",
    "for instance , different hubble types are associated with different star formation histories and different patterns of motion of stars and gas .",
    "furthermore , galaxy morphology correlates with a range of physical properties in galaxies , such as stellar mass , luminosity , size , velocity dispersion , concentration , and , particularly , color ; this suggests that morphology is crucial in our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies ( fang 2009 ; kong 2009 ) .    with the advent of the new wfc3 on board _ hst _ , with its vastly improved sensitivity and resolution compared to nicmos ,",
    "it has become possible to analyze the rest - frame optical structure of @xmath3 galaxies with an unprecedented level of detail .",
    "to describe clearly the morphologies of both  and , we have performed nonparametric measures of galaxy morphology by using data from _ hst _",
    "wfc3/h(f160w ) imaging ( grogin 2011 ; koekemoer 2011 ) , such as gini coefficient ( the relative distribution of the galaxy pixel flux values , or @xmath8 ) and @xmath9 ( the second - order moment of the brightest 20% of the galaxy s flux ) .",
    "early - type galaxies have higher @xmath8 and lower @xmath9 , while late - type galaxies have lower @xmath8 and higher @xmath9 . combining @xmath8 and @xmath9 permits classifying different galaxy population effectively ( lotz 2006 ; kong 2009 ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : mor ] , the blue squares and red circles represent the morphological distribution of 173 sgzks and 50 pgzks ( these sources have @xmath160-band counterparts ) in the rest - frame wavelength @xmath161 , respectively .",
    "the distribution of gzks is very similar to that of local galaxies ( e - sd ) in lotz 2004 , with pgzks showing high @xmath8 and low @xmath9 , and sgzks with lower @xmath8 and higher @xmath9 values .",
    "this figure clearly illustrates the morphological variety present at @xmath3 . the median ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) values for sgzks are ( 0.49 , 1.48 ) in the rest - frame optical band , while pgzks are ( 0.64 , 1.74 ) . a sample of 73 local ulirgs ( @xmath162 ) is also shown in this diagram ( lotz 2004 ) , indicated as empty stars , using data from _ hst _ wfpc 2/f814w imaging ( borne 2000 ) .",
    "the solid diamonds and triangles in figure  [ fig : mor ] represent the starburst - dominated sources at @xmath3 from bussmann ( 2011 ) and frster schreiber ( 2011 ) , respectively ; their @xmath8 and @xmath9 values were derived from nicmos / f160w images , corresponding to the rest - frame optical wavelength .",
    "the dashed line ( @xmath163 ) in this figure is drawn qualitatively at rest - frame optical band ( @xmath161 ; bussmann 2011 ) .",
    "galaxies with @xmath164 have diffuse structures or multiple bright nuclei in appearance .",
    "objects with @xmath165 and @xmath166 can be irregular , often with a bright nucleus with tidal tail or fainter knots . as for sources with @xmath165 and @xmath167 , they are relatively smooth with a single nucleus . from figure  [ fig : mor ] , we find that star - forming galaxies at high redshift not only have diffuse structures , similar to starburst - dominated ulirgs at @xmath3 with lower @xmath8 and higher @xmath9 values , but also have single - object morphologies ( higher @xmath8 and lower @xmath9 ) .",
    "moreover , the distribution of @xmath9 of sgzks is mainly located in the range from 1.0 to 1.8 ; these features of morphologies are consistent with expectations from simulations of major mergers during the beginning and end stages , respectively , of the phase of the merger when the sfr peaks and begins to turn over ( lotz 2008 ) .",

    "mid - ir photometry has been proven to be a robust and efficient tool to select agns without prior information ( e.g. , lacy 2004 ; stern 2005 ; donley 2008 ) , as their properties at these wavelengths are typically very different from those of stars and galaxies .",
    "there have been several studies of agn selection using mid - ir color or other ir properties . in this section ,",
    "two different agn selection methods are employed , to identify agns in our gzk sample .",
    "the first one is based on the irac band color criteria of stern ( 2005 ) .",
    "the second method is based on mid - ir spectral index ( barmby 2006 ; park 2010 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : mid ] shows the mid - ir color space of the egs survey along with the stern ( 2005 ) agn selection criterion ( green dot - dashed lines ) .",
    "small dots represent the distribution of mid - ir color for sources detected in all four irac channels in the aegis field ; they have very similar [ 3.6 ]  [ 4.5 ] colors , as this is dominated by their stellar emission .",
    "six hundred and twelve  in our sample are detected in all the four irac channels and are plotted as blue open circles .",
    "one hundred and twenty - two of them can be selected as agn candidates by the mid - ir selection criterion of stern ( 2005 ) .",
    "two hundred and sixteen  in our sample are detected in all the four irac channels and plotted as red open circles .",
    "thirty - five of them are agn candidates .",
    "therefore , using the mid - ir agn selection criterion , @xmath177 of  and @xmath178 of  are classified as agns , respectively .    the agn selection criterion from stern ( 2005 ) were based on the spectroscopic sample of the agn and galaxy evolution survey , most of which have redshift @xmath179 .",
    "their mid - ir color criterion is reliable for classifying agns and galaxies at low redshift .",
    "in contrast , observations and templates suggest that a high degree of stellar contamination is unavoidable when the color selection technique is applied to deeper samples ( barmby 2006 ; donley 2008 ; georgantopoulos 2008 ; assef 2010 ) .",
    "the redshift of  and  in our sample is @xmath154 ; with much deeper irac data , we will classify agns from normal galaxies with the mid - ir spectral index method in the next subsection .",
    "the slope of a galaxy sed in the infrared can be characterized by a power - law behavior of flux density with frequency @xmath180 .",
    "agn seds often follow a negative - sloping ( red ) power - law , which may arise from either thermal or non - thermal emission originating near the central region .",
    "in contrast , stellar - dominated sources at redshift @xmath181 generally exhibit positive ( blue ) irac power law emission .",
    "for this reason , mid - ir power - law @xmath17 of galaxies have been proposed and used as classification criteria for agns and normal galaxies , with a small level of galaxy contamination .    in this paper ,",
    "the irac fluxes for each gzks , covering the 3.68.0 @xmath182 m range , are fitted with a power law , @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath17 value is only accepted if the @xmath183 probability fit is @xmath184 .",
    "galaxies fitted well with a power - law sed are further classified as red or blue .",
    "a limit of @xmath185 , following donley ( 2008 ) and park ( 2010 ) , is chosen to classify gzks as agns .",

    "<S> using a simple two - color selection based on @xmath0- , @xmath1- , and @xmath2-band photometry , we pick out 1609 star - forming galaxies ( ) and 422 passively evolving galaxies ( ) at @xmath3 from a @xmath2-band- selected sample ( @xmath4 ) in an area of @xmath5 deg@xmath6 of the all - wavelength extended groth strip international survey . </S>",
    "<S> the number counts of  in our sample turn over at @xmath7 , and both the number of faint and bright objects ( including  and ) exceed the predictions of a recent semi - analytic model of galaxy formation , a more successful model is need to explain this diversity . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the star formation rate ( sfr ) and specific sfr ( ssfr ) of   increases with redshift at all masses , implying that star - forming galaxies were much more active on average in the past . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the ssfr of massive galaxies is lower at all redshifts , suggesting that star formation contributes more to the mass growth of low - mass galaxies than to high - mass galaxies . from _ hubble space telescope _ </S>",
    "<S> wide field camera 3 near - infrared imaging data , we find that morphologies of @xmath3 galaxies not only have diffuse structures with lower @xmath8 and higher @xmath9 values , but also have single - object morphologies ( higher @xmath8 and lower @xmath9 ) , implying that there are morphological variety and different formation process for these galaxies at @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we also study the fraction of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) in the , 82 of 828  with four irac bands can be classified as agns ( @xmath10 10% ) . </S>",
    "<S> most of these agn candidates have @xmath11 . </S>"
