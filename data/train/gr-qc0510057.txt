    "during the past several years astronomical observations have provided almost indisputable evidence in favour of the existence of ` dark ' supermassive objects ( with a mass spectrum @xmath0 ) in the majority of galactic cores , including our own milky way @xcite .",
    "conventional wisdom dictates that these objects should be kerr black holes as described by general relativity .",
    "this belief is ( so far ) rather based on our faith in general relativity itself rather than on hard ` experimental ' evidence .",
    "other candidate massive objects have been proposed ( such as soliton stars , boson stars , gravastars and p - stars @xcite ) but these are treated with scepticism by the community as they involve ` exotic ' physics .    the future lisa gravitational wave detector @xcite is expected to be able to give a definitive answer to whether these massive objects are kerr black holes or not .",
    "it is commonly accepted @xcite that lisa will have the potential of ` mapping ' the spacetime in these objects close vicinity .",
    "this can be achieved by detection of gravitational radiation emitted during the inspiral of a stellar - mass compact body around the supermassive object .",
    "it is expected that lisa will be capable of detecting from several to about a thousand @xcite of these extreme mass ratio inspirals ( emris ) , during a @xmath1 years mission . for",
    "the actual detection and subsequent extraction of the system s physical properties , lisa s data analysis will rely heavily on matched filtering .",
    "this method is based on cross - correlating the detector s noisy output with a pre - selected bank of waveform templates which should be accurate representations of the true signal . among anticipated gravitational wave sources ,",
    "emris are thought of as one of the ` cleanest ' : they can be accurately modelled as a binary system of a ` test - body ' orbiting a kerr black hole , evolving under its own gravitational dynamics , without receiving any other significant ` environmental ' influence .",
    "the basic tool for studying such a system is black hole perturbation theory : the small body of mass @xmath2 perturbing the spacetime of the much more massive black hole ( of mass @xmath3 ) . for recent detailed reviews on emris and further references on the subject we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite .    in their great majority ,",
    "emri - related studies take for granted the kerr identity of the supermassive object . however , if we ever hope to materialise any spacetime - mapping program with lisa we should be prepared to dismiss ( at least to some degree ) this assumption .",
    "in fact , any claim that lisa will be able to probe the kerr metric would require the use of realistic waveform templates which contain in some suitable parametric form deviations from the kerr metric . the task of a lisa data analyst would be to quantify these deviations , most likely pointing to a null result .",
    "this idea was first put forward by fintan ryan in the late 90s . in a series of papers @xcite ,",
    "ryan demonstrated how lisa could in principle construct a map of the massive body s spacetime by means of emris observations .",
    "his method is based on writing the general stationary axisymmetric vacuum metric in terms of multipole moments as prescribed in ref .",
    "these can be mass moments @xmath4 and current moments @xmath5 , both labelled by the angular integer eigenvalue @xmath6 . given the moments , the metric takes the _ symbolic _ form @xcite,@xcite , g_ab ~_n=0^ [ mexpan ] where @xmath7 are known angular functions and angular brackets stand for the contribution of lower moments ( if they exist for given @xmath8 ) .",
    "these multipole moments will be clearly encoded in the geodesic equations of motion for a test - body and consequently in the phase and amplitude of the emitted waveform .",
    "lisa ( as any other gravitational wave detector ) will be capable of tracking this phase with high precession and extract valuable information concerning the spacetime s multipolar structure .    the key feature that makes this method so attractive is that kerr spacetime is special , in the sense that all of its higher moments are locked to the first two , the mass @xmath9 and spin @xmath10 @xcite , m_+ is_= m(ia)^[nohair ] where @xmath11 is the familiar kerr spin parameter .",
    "this relation is unique to kerr holes and is a mathematical expression of the famous ` no - hair ' theorem @xcite . in practise",
    "this means that extracting just the three lowest moments , @xmath12 and ( say ) the quadrupole moment @xmath13 , is sufficient for verifying ( or disproving ! ) that the central body is indeed a kerr black hole .",
    "measurement of additional higher moments could pinpoint the identity of the body . ) .",
    "] we should emphasise that a possible non - kerr multipolar structure does not necessarily imply a non - kerr identity for the massive object .",
    "a true kerr hole with a substantial amount of material in its vicinity ( say , in the form of an accretion disk ) could effectively behave as a non - kerr object .",
    "this scenario is not included in our present discussion but certainly merits a future detailed investigation .",
    "ryan s multipole expansion scheme is certainly an elegant and powerful method for ` mapping spacetimes ' , nevertheless there are some serious issues regarding its practicality .",
    "computing gravitational waveforms for emris requires ( i ) precise knowledge of a test - body s geodesic motion and ( ii ) a wave - emission formalism that allows the calculation of waveforms and fluxes , once the orbital motion is prescribed . for the case of a kerr black hole ,",
    "geodesic motion is well known and extensively studied @xcite , while wave dynamics is studied with the help of the celebrated teukolsky formalism @xcite which encapsulates the dynamics of gravitational perturbations in one single master equation .",
    "however , it is not always appreciated that the study of both orbital and wave dynamics is greatly simplified due to the speciality of kerr spacetime . in particular , one is able to first decouple and then separate the dynamical equations thanks to the petrov type-@xmath14 character of the kerr spacetime and a suitable choice of coordinate frame @xcite,@xcite .",
    "life is considerably more complicated if we consider a non - kerr spacetime with arbitrary multipolar structure . to begin with , according to ( [ mexpan ] ) an accurate representation of the metric in the strong field regime ( the most relevant part of the inspiral for lisa )",
    "requires the inclusion of a large number of multipoles .",
    "this point can be made clearer if we notice that the metric ( [ mexpan ] ) is an expansion in @xmath15 around the flat minkowski spacetime .",
    "a more suitable expansion would be around ( say ) the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "we will return to this point in future work .",
    "complications first appear at the level of geodesic motion .",
    "the spacetime s stationary - axisymmetric character guarantees the existence of two integrals of motion , the energy @xmath16 and angular momentum ( along the symmetry axis ) @xmath17",
    ". however , the third integral of motion ( the famous carter constant for the kerr metric ) will typically be lost , as the hamilton - jacobi equation is not fully separable ( see @xcite for the solution of this equation in the kerr case ) .",
    "two integrals of motion are sufficient ( together with initial conditions ) for fully describing motion only for the special case of equatorial orbits . for generic orbits ( which is the case relevant for lisa ) the insufficient number of integrals of motion would force us to use the second - order geodesic equation of motion .",
    "this would result in a more complicated description of geodesic motion ( as compared to the kerr case ) , but technical complication is not the sole problem here .",
    "fewer integrals of motion could easily translate into chaotic dynamical behaviour which in turn would have a great impact on lisa data analysis .",
    "the picture appears even more blurred when one attempts to study wave dynamics in a non - kerr metric .",
    "lack of decoupling for the perturbation equations inhibits the formulation of a ` teukolsky - like ' equation  the most versatile method in black hole perturbation theory is now lost .",
    "an alternative way of computing rigorous gravitational waveforms and fluxes would be the direct numerical time evolution of metric perturbations ( after separation of the azimuthal @xmath18 coordinate ) which come in a package of ten coupled partial differential equations ( combined with four gauge - condition equations ) @xcite .",
    "motivated ( and partially discouraged ! ) by the above complications , we adopt a somewhat different ( albeit less general ) approach in the present work .",
    "based on the belief that the massive objects in galactic nuclei are most likely kerr black holes , we only address the question : is the spacetime around these objects described by the exact kerr metric , or by a _",
    "slightly _ different metric ?",
    "we do _ not _ attempt to identify the source of this metric , in fact we are agnostic on this issue .",
    "our less ambitious goal is to quantify the deviation from the kerr metric .",
    "this point should be emphasised because none of the other candidate objects can be considered in any sense as being ` almost ' a kerr black hole .",
    "the idea of building a ` quasi - black hole ' spacetime has been recently advocated by collins & hughes @xcite .",
    "these authors constructed a ` bumpy ' schwarzschild black hole by adding a certain amount of quadrupole moment ( in the form of a given mass distribution outside the black hole ) and then studied equatorial orbits in the resulting spacetime .",
    "in our scheme we modify the quadrupole moment of the exact kerr metric ( this is the lowest moment where kerr can be distinguished from the spacetime of another axisymmetric / stationary body ) .",
    "this procedure is performed in a natural way with the help of the well - known hartle - thorne exterior metric @xcite .",
    "the resulting ` quasi - kerr ' metric is customised for use in strong gravity situations and has the nice feature of smoothly reducing to the familiar kerr metric in boyer - lindquist ( bl ) coordinates .",
    "being arbitrarily close to the bl kerr metric ( which allows full separability of the hamilton - jacoby and wave equations ) allows us to formulate first - order equations of motion and integrals of motion by perturbing the well known kerr equations . as yet , we have _ not _ explored whether the same trick would lead to a ` quasi - teukolsky ' perturbation equation . for the purposes of the present investigation",
    "it is quite sufficient to use the so - called hybrid approximation @xcite,@xcite and compute ` kludge ' waveforms .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : building ]",
    "we provide the prescription for building our quasi - kerr metric .",
    "this is the paper s main result . section  [ sec : geodesic ] is devoted to the solution of the hamilton - jacobi equation in the quasi - kerr metric .",
    "we first discuss the issue of separation of variables for this equation and then proceed with the derivation of equations of motion based on standard canonical perturbation theory .",
    "section  [ sec : equat ] is dedicated to the study of equatorial orbits and comparison of orbital frequencies and periastron advance for kerr and quasi - kerr orbits . in section  [ sec : waveforms ] we compute approximate waveforms from test - bodies in equatorial orbits of the quasi - kerr metric .",
    "these are compared to their kerr analogues by calculating their overlap function in the lisa sensitivity band . in the same section we touch upon the problem of ` confusion ' between kerr and quasi - kerr waveforms . a summary and concluding discussion can be found in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "appendices containing some technical details , including a review of the action - angle formalism in the kerr spacetime can be found at the end of the paper . throughout the paper we use geometrised units",
    "@xmath19 and adopt a @xmath20 signature for the metric .",
    "we repeatedly use the labels ` k ' and ` qk ' for ` kerr ' and ` quasi - kerr ' , respectively .",
    "as we mentioned in the introduction , the central idea of our work is to replace the general multipolar expansion ( [ mexpan ] ) of an axisymmetric - stationary vacuum spacetime with a less general ` quasi - kerr ' metric . in the language of multipole moments",
    "this means , m_&= & m_^k + m _ , 2 + s_&= & s_^k + s _ ,   3 where @xmath21 are assumed small . with respect to the first two leading moments @xmath12 the spacetimes outside a kerr hole and any other stationary axisymmetric rotating body",
    "are indistinguishable .",
    "essentially , @xmath22 and @xmath23 can take the same value for both bodies ( the spin is presumably limited , for a kerr hole @xmath24 ) .",
    "this degeneracy is broken as soon as we take into account the next most important moment , the mass quadrupole @xmath13 . in our scheme",
    "we choose to take into account only the deviation in the quadrupole moment @xmath25 and _ neglect _ any deviation in all higher moments .",
    "we introduce the dimensionless deviation parameter @xmath26 as could take , we use the results of laarakkers & poisson @xcite for the quadrupole moment of rotating neutron stars .",
    "they show that the quadrupole moment could be approximated as @xmath27 .",
    "the factor @xmath28 is a function of the mass and equation of state , with numerical values varying from 2 to 12 ( decreasing with mass and increasing with stiffness of the equation of state ) .",
    "it was emphasised in @xcite that this relationship holds even for fast rotations .",
    "the fact that @xmath28 is positive reflects oblateness of the mass distribution . using this relationship",
    "we obtain : @xmath29 , which tells us that for ( stiff ) rotating neutron star ( with @xmath30 ) @xmath31 could be as large as @xmath32 . ]",
    "= ^k - m^3 , ^k = - .",
    "our quasi - kerr metric takes the form , g _",
    "= g_^k + h _",
    "+ o(m_4 , s_3 ) [ qkerr ] where @xmath33 is the _ exact _ kerr metric .",
    "our goal is to determine the metric functions @xmath34 .",
    "this can be achieved by using the hartle - thorne ( h - t ) metric @xcite which describes the spacetime outside _ any _ slowly rotating axisymmetric and stationary body .",
    "indeed , this metric is fully accurate up to the quadrupole moment ( which scales quadratically with the body s spin ) , and it includes as a special case the kerr metric ( at @xmath35 order ) .",
    "it is then possible to isolate the leading - order quadrupole moment deviation and deduce the @xmath36 piece in ( [ qkerr ] ) .",
    "implicit in this prescription is the assumption that the massive body s exterior spacetime has nonzero higher moments induced by the body s rotation , in the same sense that a black hole has nonzero moments ( with @xmath37 ) only when @xmath38 . as a consequence , terms of order @xmath39",
    "are beyond the desired accuracy and therefore neglected .",
    "unlike the general multipole expansion ( [ mexpan ] ) , our prescription by construction offers no information ( regarding possible deviations from the kerr values ) on moments higher than the quadrupole . on the other hand",
    "our metric is not an expansion in inverse powers of @xmath40 , instead is written in a compact fully relativistic form suitable for strong - field conditions .",
    "we move on to the calculation of @xmath41 . for our purposes",
    "we shall only need the _ exterior _ h - t metric @xcite which is expressed in terms of the dimensionless parameters , j , q - then at @xmath42 accuracy , the metric is given by ( these expressions are taken from ref .",

    "note that the metric ( [ ht1 ] ) is written in the coordinate frame @xmath45 originally used by hartle & thorne . without loss of generality ,",
    "we can write q = j^2 + [ deviation ] clearly , the limit @xmath46 corresponds to the h - t representation of kerr spacetime .    for reasons we discuss later in the paper",
    ", it is highly desirable for the quasi - kerr metric to reduce to the familiar kerr metric in boyer - lindquist ( bl ) coordinates in the limit @xmath47 . the transformation between bl and the original h - t coordinates was provided by hartle & thorne : t_bl & = & t , _ bl = +   + r_bl & = & r - [ ( r+2m)(r - m ) -^2(r-2 m ) ( r+3 m ) ] + & & r - j^2 m^2 f_bl(r , ) +   + _ bl & = & - ( r+2 m ) -j^2 m^2 g_bl(r , ) [ ht2bl ] written in this manner , this transformation is not really practical for someone wishing to obtain the metric in bl coordinates .",
    "fortunately , inverting the above equations with respect to the h - t coordinates is a trivial task . according to ( [ ht2bl ] ) @xmath48 and @xmath49 ; therefore we are free to use either set of coordinates in the functions @xmath50 since these appear in the @xmath42 terms .",

    "as the two sets of coordinates differ at order @xmath51 the quadrupole - order pieces in ( [ ht1 ] ) are immune with respect to the transformation ( [ bl2ht ] ) .",
    "only the ` schwarzschild ' portion of the metric is affected by the coordinate transformation . for the contravariant metric components we obtain : g^tt_ht & = & g^tt_ka^2 + ( 1 - 2m / r)^-1 [ f_3(r ) + f_4(r )",

    "( [ ht_bl1 ] ) one can extract the desired deviation @xmath36 .",
    "putting all the pieces together , the ansatz for building a quasi - kerr metric in boyer - lindquist coordinates is : g_ab = g_ab^k + h_ab [ qmetric ] where , h^tt & = & ( 1 - 2m / r)^-1 [ ( 1 - 3 ^ 2)f_1(r ) ] , h^rr = ( 1 - 2m / r ) [ ( 1 - 3 ^ 2)f_1(r ) ] +   + h^ & = & - [ ( 1 - 3 ^ 2 ) f_2(r ) ] , h^ = - [ ( 1 - 3 ^ 2 ) f_2(r ) ] +   + h^t & = & 0 the functions @xmath55 are given in appendix  [ app : ht_funcs ] .    looking at the explicit form of @xmath56 it is evident that these functions are divergent at @xmath57 .",
    "this would correspond to the location of the event horizon at the accuracy @xmath51 of the h - t metric .",
    "hence , there is no real mystery behind this behaviour which is also present in the case of the full kerr metric . however , since in our scheme we do not associate the quasi - kerr metric with a black hole we are forced to be agnostic regarding the nature of the ` surface ' of the massive body . whether is an event horizon or something else is an issue we simply do _ not _ address .",
    "this lack of information has no significant impact on the study of orbital motion of a test - body , as long as we do not consider orbits too close to @xmath58 ( assuming they exist ) .",
    "the situation is not so clear when one tries to study wave dynamics in a quasi - kerr metric and compute ( say ) fluxes .",
    "to begin with , we should mention that a first approximation would be to completely neglect any gravitational flux impinging on the ` surface ' , assuming that is small compared to the fluxes at infinity .",
    "this is certainly true for the case of black holes @xcite,@xcite and it is not unreasonable to expect the same in other scenarios .",
    "the main issue regards the computation of the fluxes at infinity , and their sensitivity to the absence of a concrete boundary condition at @xmath59 .",
    "one could try different boundary conditions , say , perfect reflection or free propagation and assess how robust the flux results are ( see for example ref .",
    "other aspects of wave dynamics in a quasi - kerr field , such as the existence and properties of quasi - normal modes , are extremely sensitive to boundary conditions and can not be studied within our framework .",
    "an elegant method for deriving equations of motion for a point - particle in a given gravitational potential is the hamilton - jacobi ( h - j ) formalism ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for background material and appendix  [ app : kerrhj ] of the present paper ) .",
    "the end - product is the known h - j equation for the generating function @xmath60 , which in its general relativistic version is written as , g^ + = 0 [ hjeqn ] where @xmath61 is the geodesic affine parameter .",
    "in essence , this equation follows from the definition of the hamiltonian for point - particle motion , h(x^,p _ ) = g^ p_p _ = -^2 [ superh ] by replacing the four momenta @xmath62 by @xmath63 . here",
    "the bl coordinates @xmath64 are conjugate to @xmath65 .",
    "one of the ` miracles ' of the kerr metric is that it allows _ full _ separability of the h - j equation , leading to the well - known kerr geodesic equations of motion @xcite , @xcite .",
    "separability with respect to @xmath66 generates the conserved quantities @xmath67 ( the test - body s mass ) , @xmath16 ( energy ) and @xmath17 ( angular momentum along the symmetry axis ) .",
    "this is always possible as long as the metric is stationary - axisymmetric .",
    "the special property of the kerr metric ( originating from its petrov type-@xmath14 character ) is that it allows the additional , non - trivial , separability with respect to @xmath68 , leading to the third constant @xmath69 , the carter constant .",
    "this is possible _ only _ in a restricted family of coordinate frames , the bl one among them @xcite .",
    "in fact , if we expand the kerr metric with respect to @xmath70 , then the h - j equation is separable at each individual order .    on the other hand ,",
    "the h - j equation is _ not _ fully separable with respect to the h - t metric ( [ ht1 ] ) , not even when the kerr limit @xmath46 is taken .",
    "this reveals that the coordinate frame used in the original h - t metric is not ` privileged ' and consequently a bad choice for a quasi - kerr metric .",
    "instead , bl coordinates seem like a good choice as in the limit @xmath46 they admit separability .",
    "a similar conclusion can be reached for the general metric ( [ mexpan ] ) . in its present form",
    "it does not allow separation of the h - j equation ( or of the scalar and gravitational perturbation equations ) even when the kerr limit is taken ( which corresponds to enforcing relation  ( [ nohair ] ) ) .",
    "the h - j equation for the full quasi - kerr metric ( [ qkerr ] ) is solved by assuming the standard form , s = ^2 -et + l_z + s_r(r ) + s _ ( ) with an extra expansion , _",
    "r , = s_r , + _",
    "r , [ sexpan ] where @xmath71 solves the exact kerr h - j equation . after separating out the kerr portion of ( [ hjeqn ] ) , and neglecting @xmath72 terms ,",

    "-f_4 -f_4r(r-2 m ) ( ) ^2 this non - vanishing function spoils the separability of ( [ leftover ] ) .",
    "in retrospect , this is not really surprising as the addition of the @xmath31-pieces ` contaminates ' the kerr metric in the sense that the resulting quasi - kerr spacetime is not type-@xmath14 anymore , although ( in some loose sense ) is arbitrarily ` close ' ( this is also the explanation for why the non type-@xmath14 h - t metric does not lead to a separable h - j equation ) .    at this point",
    "it would seem that no real advantage has being gained by using the quasi - kerr metric ( [ qkerr ] ) as the h - j equation is still non - separable with respect to @xmath68 .",
    "however , the fact that the equation is separable in the @xmath46 limit can be exploited and by means of canonical perturbation theory @xcite can lead to the desired equations of motion ( see section  [ sec : qkerr_geod ] ) .    studying geodesic motion in a quasi - kerr field is just the first step towards solving the emri problem . for gravitational wave observations",
    "it is pivotal to be able to compute accurate waveforms and fluxes . in the case of kerr black holes ,",
    "this is achieved by means of the teukolsky equation @xcite ( see @xcite , @xcite for reviews relevant to emri , and further references ) , which governs the dynamics of perturbations of the weyl scalars @xmath74 in the framework of the classic newman - penrose formalism . the remarkable result that all these perturbations are described by one single master equation is a consequence ( once more ) of the petrov type-@xmath14 character of the kerr metric , which allows decoupling of the various perturbation equations @xcite .",
    "moreover , for a certain class of coordinate frames ( the bl the most widely used one ) the teukolsky equation admits separation of variables , reducing the problem to the solution of simple odes .",
    "none of these properties survive for a non type-@xmath14 metric such as ( [ mexpan ] ) or ( [ qkerr ] ) . however , as the quasi - kerr metric is ` almost ' type-@xmath14 there may still be a chance of decoupling ( at least partially ) the perturbation equations for the weyl scalars .",
    "this crucial issue is left for future work . in the unfortunate case that this expectation proves untrue",
    ", we may have to work with straight metric perturbations which are governed by ten coupled pdes plus gauge conditions .",
    "these equations will still admit separation with respect to @xmath18 so they can be studied in the time - domain in a ` @xmath75 ' format .",
    "in the present paper , the issue of wave dynamics will be dealt by simply computing approximate waveforms ( section  [ sec : waveforms ] ) , but our conclusions should be valid even if we had rigorous waveforms at our disposal .",
    "although we are mainly concerned with equatorial orbits in this paper , we nevertheless derive approximate equations of motion for generic quasi - kerr orbits .",
    "our objective is to demonstrate how one can arrive to such equations despite the non - separability of the h - j equation and without resorting to the full second - order equations of geodesic motion .",
