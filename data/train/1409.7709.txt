    "since the launch of nasa s  mission @xcite , the number of confirmed exoplanets has increased from about 300 to over 1490 as of july 2014",
    ".  contributed to a majority of these new discoveries ( @xmath0 ) while providing an additional sample of over 3,000 exoplanet candidates (  objects of interest , kois ; e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the transit method has thus surpassed the radial velocity ( rv ) method to become the most fruitful means of detecting exoplanets .",
    "meanwhile , great promise lies within the new and future exoplanet surveys and instruments with direct imaging ( e.g. , the gemini planet imager , gpi , @xcite ) and microlensing ( e.g. , the wide - field infrared survey telescope , wfirst , @xcite ) , while the fronts of rv and transit exoplanet searches keep expanding ( e.g. , the miniature exoplanet radial velocity array , minerva , @xcite ; the habitable - zone planet finder , hpf , @xcite and the transiting exoplanet survey satellit , tess , @xcite ) .",
    "this paper describes our continuing efforts since @xcite and @xcite to maintain the exoplanet orbit database(eod ) and the exoplanets data explorer ( ede ) , to keep track of exoplanet discoveries , and to better catalog orbital parameters and host star properties .",
    "there are other entities devoted to similar efforts , including the extrasolar planets encyclopaedia @xcite and the nasa exoplanet archive @xcite .",
    "the natures of these efforts are largely complementary to the eod , and to the degree that they are redundant provide important cross - checking and validation .",
    "as described in @xcite , the eod is dedicated to cataloging properties of all _ robustly - detected _ exoplanets with _ well - determined _ orbital parameters published in _ peer - reviewed _ literature , and providing outstanding data exploration and visualization tools for these planets .",
    "the eod is hosted at the web domain exoplanets.org , which also hosts the ede , an interactive table with plotting tools for all the eod exoplanets , in addition to other confirmed exoplanets without good orbital parameters , and kois ( except for those with a `` false positive '' disposition at the exoplanet archive ) .",
    "the entire dataset of exoplanets.org is available for download as a single comma separated value file from the website front page .",
    "an example of this csv file is available with the electronic version of this paper .",
    "the eod is widely used in exoplanet research ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and the website exoplanets.org had over @xmath1 visits in 2013 .",
    "since the documentation described in @xcite , the eod has expanded its scope : we now do not require the host star of an exoplanet to be a normal star ( e.g. , exoplanets around pulsars are now included ) .",
    "we now ingest more parameters describing the exoplanet systems and their host stars , and some parameters have been revised or deleted .",
    "we describe our updates to the eod in section  [ sec : update ] .",
    "the ede at exoplanets.org has also expanded its scope and now includes the  exoplanet candidates ( kois ) .",
    "we describe these changes in section  [ sec : kepler ] .",
    "the website exoplanets.org has gone through major back - end changes since @xcite , which are described in section  [ sec : website ] .",
    "we summarize the updates and possible future improvements in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the scope of the eod has expanded , and there are three major changes from what was described in @xcite .",
    "previously , we only included exoplanets orbiting the  normal stars \" , but now we are not limiting the type of host stars ( e.g. we included exoplanets orbiting neutron stars ) . furthermore , in @xcite , we only included exoplanets that were discovered by the rv and transit methods in the eod , but now we also include planets discovered via timing ( including pulsar planets and those discovered by eclipse timing ) .",
    "we now include exoplanets discovered by any other methods with robust detections and good orbital parameters , such as @xmath2 pictoris @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "previously , we used a generous mass cutoff , recognizing that any definition of `` exoplanet '' will not necessarily track with the formation mechanism for an object ( which may , after all , be unknown or unknowable ) .",
    "our previous mass cutoff was a minimum mass ( m@xmath4 ) smaller than 24 ; to make this cutoff more relevant to a wide range of stellar masses and detection methods , we now require the measured planet - star mass ratio to be smaller than 24 @xmath5 ( @xmath6 .    the rest of the selection criteria for the eod remain unchanged .",
    "we still require the planets to have robust detections and well - determined orbits ( though these are not strictly quantitative and sometimes subjective ; see section  2 of @xcite ) .",
    "if new evidence comes to light and we are no longer confident about a planet , we may remove it from eod , even if the new evidence is not peer reviewed .",
    "the rationale for this scheme is , as it has been since the cne , that the eod represents our best , expert effort to produce a clean set of trustworthy parameters .",
    "we do not report _ all _ the announced exoplanets as we are not trying to provide  an encyclopedic presentation of every claimed detection of an exoplanet \" @xcite .",
    "more comprehensive sets of planet parameters are available from other exoplanet compendia on the web .    in the following subsections ,",
    "we describe the newly added and revised fields since @xcite , and list all fields in table  [ tab : par ] .",
    "we divide the fields into categories consistent with the individual planet page on exoplanets.org .",
    "( figure  [ fig : individual ] is an example of individual planet page , which is presented to website users who click on a planet s name ) .",
    "some fields are not explicitly tabulated on the page ( e.g. , the urls for ads pages for papers providing the underlying data ) , but are explicitly listed in the downloadable .csv file ( see section  [ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "though we focus on the eod in this section , the fields apply to all planets on exoplanets.org .",
    "we follow the definition of orbital elements in @xcite unless indicated otherwise .",
    "we report general information of when , by whom and how the planets were discovered and first reported and provide the references for underlying data .",
    "we describe the added or revised fields since @xcite below .",
    "the discmeth field previously reported the method of discovery , which was either `` radial velocity '' or `` transit '' .",
    "we have replaced discmeth with * planetdiscmeth * and * stardiscmeth * to better report how exoplanet systems and individual exoplanets are first discovered .",
    "planetdiscmeth reports the discovery method for the planet , while stardiscmeth reports the discovery method for the _ planetary system _",
    "( i.e. the _ first _ discovered planet around the host star ) .",
    "these fields are stored in string format and have one of the following values :  rv \" ,  transit \" ,  imaging \" ,  microlensing \" ,  timing \" , or  astrometry \" ( no planets have a value of  astrometry \" yet since no planet has yet been _ discovered _ via astrometry ) .",
    "the * month * field reports the integer month of the peer - reviewed paper publication date .",
    "* kepid * stands for kepler identification , which is the integer number assigned for a kepler host star .",
    "kepid is only available for unconfirmed koi s imported directly from the exoplanet archive by the exoplanets.org backend .",
    "* koi * stands for kepler object of interest , which is an object with transit signals detected by  that have not been validated as being due to exoplanets . the koi field defined by the team and shown on the exoplanet archive",
    "is stored as a floating point number , consisting of a whole number designated to the host star followed by a decimal portion denoting a candidate planet .",
    "for example , koi 102 is a star suspected to host two exoplanets , and koi 102.01 is the inner planet candidate and koi 102.02 is the outer one .",
    "once a candidate is confirmed , the * name * field of the planet is replaced by the official  i d (  kepler \" followed by a hyphen , an integer , a space , and finally a lower case letter ) . the koi number is then used as * othername*. for more information , see section  [ sec : kepler ] .    * eod * is a boolean which indicates whether an exoplanet is included in the eod for having well - characterized orbital parameters , such as the orbital period ( per ) .",
    "we added this field because exoplanets.org now also includes robustly discovered planets that do not have well - characterized orbits , and also  planet candidates ( see section  [ sec : kepler ] for more details ) .",
    "planets on exoplanets.org and appearing in the ede that are not part of the eod have eod set to false ( i.e.  zero ) .",
    "* microlensing , imaging , timing * and * astrometry * are boolean flags which indicate that a planet has been detected via these methods . for example , microlensing @xmath7 1 means the planet is detected in a microlensing event .",
    "note that planets may be detected with multiple methods .",
    "we report the orbital parameters that determine the shape of the planet s orbit . depending on the detection methods ,",
    "different sets of parameters are given by the literature .",
    "for instance , if a planet is detected by the radial velocity method , the semiamplitude , @xmath8 , is reported , whereas the inclination of the orbit , @xmath9 , is usually only known via the transit method ( although planet - planet interactions and astrometry can also determine it ) .",
    "we describe the added fields since @xcite below .    *",
    "mass * is the mass of the planet in the unit of jupiter mass .",
    "previously , we only reported the minimum mass , ( @xmath10 , msini ) of the planets .",
    "we now , additionally , report the best estimate of the true mass in a heterogeneous way . for example , if a planet is discovered by microlensing , we report the actual mass of the planet according to the literature . if a planet has both radial velocity and transit measurements , we calculate the mass from the minimum mass @xmath10 and the orbital inclination @xmath9 . for convenience of plotting rv and other planets on a common mass scale ( see section  [ sec : kepler ] ) ,",
    "mass is set to msini if the orbital inclination is not known and the reference for mass ( * massref * ) is set to `` set to msini ; i unknown '' .    also for plotting convenience , for transiting @xmath11 planets without @xmath10 measured , we estimate their mass using mass - radius relations from the literature .",
    "we follow a series of relations given by    @xmath12    where @xmath3 is defined below , and we use the weight @xmath13 to smoothly transition between @xmath14 and @xmath15 in their overlapping regions of validity .",
    "@xmath14 is from @xcite and is given by @xmath16    @xmath15 is given by @xmath17 from @xcite , and @xmath18 is given by @xmath19    from @xcite , where @xmath20 $ & 1756.7 & 1308.7 \\\\ $ b[\\rearth]$ & 11.684 & 11.858 \\\\ $ w$ & 1.646 & 1.635 \\\\ $ p$ & 2.489 & 2.849 \\\\   \\end{tabular}\\ ] ]    planets with masses estimated in this manner are so noted in the massref field .",
    "* sep * is a separation between the host star and the planet in units of au . for directly imaged and microlensing planets ,",
    "the literature usually reports the projected separation and we report the value accordingly . if sep is not directly measured but the semi - major axis ( * a * ) is available , then we set sep to a with its reference , sepref , set to `` set to a '' .",
    "the parameter * i * reports the orbital inclination of the planet .",
    "previously , only transiting systems had @xmath9 measured , but now some non - transiting systems have dynamical or astrometric constraints on @xmath9 ( for example , the microlensing system ogle-2006-blg-109l by @xcite and the imaged system , @xmath2 pictoris by @xcite ) .    *",
    "bigom * is the longitude of the ascending node ( @xmath21 ) in units of degrees . at the moment , only @xmath2 pictoris @xmath3 has this quantity listed .",
    "* lambda * is the projected spin - orbit misalignment ( @xmath22 ) in the plane of the sky in units of degrees . at the moment ,",
    "@xmath22 values are only available for the transiting systems , which are measured by either the rossiter - mclaughlin effect ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or planetary transits of star spots ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xmath22 is used because the true spin - orbit angle , defined as the angle between the stellar spin axis and the orbital axis , is normally not directly measurable .",
    "we follow @xcite who defined the quantity as follows : the @xmath23-axis points toward the observer , the @xmath24-axis points along the intersection of the sky plane and the planet s orbital plane with the ascending node of the planet having @xmath25 , and the @xmath26-axis completes a right handed - triad .",
    "@xmath22 is measured clockwise on the sky from the @xmath26-axis to the projected stellar rotational axis .",
    "@xmath22 is not a newly added field to the eod but we describe it here because we did not previously report it consistently , since some literature report the  projected spin - orbit misalignment \" as @xmath27 instead .",
    "we have sorted these cases out and made sure that our @xmath22 s are following the definition of @xcite .",
    "the * massref * and * massurl * fields were used to report the reference and the url of stellar mass but now they are used for the planet s mass ; * mstarref * and * mstarurl * are now used for the stellar mass , * mstar*.      we have added two fields since @xcite , which are used for koi s incorporated from the exoplanet archive .    *",
    "dr * is the distance between the planet and the star during the transit in stellar radii .",
    "this is one of the parameters that goes into the transit light curve modeling ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "* rr * is the ratio of the planetary radius and the stellar radius .",
    "if the transit depth ( depth ) is not given , we calculate depth by taking square of rr , but we do not calculate rr from depth .      we have added an entirely new set of fields for secondary eclipse depths .",
    "previously , due to the limits of instrumentation and limited sample of exoplanets , there was not much secondary eclipse depth data available . since @xcite , as many different surveys have been launched , secondary eclipse depths at multiple bands have become available for many planets .",
    "therefore , we added this entire new set of fields ( see figure  [ fig : se ] ) .",
    "* sedepthx * whereas x stands for one of ",
    "j \" ,  h \" ,  ks \" ,  kp \" ,  36 \" ,  45 \" ,  58 \" ,  80 \" : these fields are the secondary eclipse depth measured in the corresponding wavelength band .",
    "sedepthj , h , and ks are the depths measured in the 2mass wavelength bands in the near infrared , centered at 1.25  , 1.65  , and 2.15  , respectively .",
    "kp is the depth measured in the  photometric band which spans 400 to 865  nm .",
    "the other four represent the  irac bands centered at 3.6  , 4.5  , 5.8  , and 8.0  .",
    "the * se * boolean indicates whether the system has secondary eclipse depths measured in any band .",
    "truth indicates the system has at least one secondary eclipse measurement in the eod .",
    "this set of parameters provides users the physical parameters of the exoplanet host stars .",
    "most of the parameters are derived from the stellar models in the literature and we provide the readers with the references .",
    "we describe added fields since @xcite below .    *",
    "gamma * ( @xmath28 ) is the radial velocity of the center of mass of the planetary system with respect to the barycentric frame and is reported in km / s .",
    "it is typically known to far less precision than @xmath8 , because it requires an absolute measurement of velocity .",
    "* rstar * is the radius of the star in the solar units .",
    "* rhostar * is the density of the star in g/@xmath29 .",
    "we provide the brightness of the host star measured in different filters .",
    "we report optical magnitude and color ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) , 2mass @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 magnitudes and , we have added * kp * for the  photometric band .",
    "note that the definitions of @xmath30 and @xmath35 in the literature vary , and are often hipparcos magnitudes .",
    "we report the coordinates of the host star as well as the host star s i d as designated by different catalogs .",
    "we have added the * dist * field since @xcite , which is the distance to the host star in the unit of pc .",
    "if only parallax ( par ) is given , we calculate dist based on par and vice versa . if the literature does not report dist or par , then we obtain par from the hipparcos dataset by @xcite for stars with hipparcos numbers .",
    "we navely translate the 1-@xmath36 errors in each into asymmetric uncertainties in the other .",
    "we have changed the way of reporting uncertainties , especially asymmetric ones since @xcite .",
    "we now report uncertainties for a certain field x as xupper , xlower and ux . xupper and xlower store the upper and lower 1@xmath36 uncertainties , and they are different when the error bars are asymmetric .",
    "ux contains the 1@xmath36 uncertainty , and it equals @xmath37 .",
    "fields that have xupper , xlower and ux are : all the orbital parameters , all the transit parameters , all the secondary eclipse fields , and all the stellar properties and dist and par .      the fields * xref * and * xurl * store the peer - reviewed reference and link to the publication for the data in field x. previously , we reported only general references for certain sets of fields ( e.g. firstref , firsturl , orbref , and orburl ) , but now we report the references for most of the fields on an individual basis .    the following fields do not have associated ref or url fields . except where we record these values directly from discovery papers , * ra * , * dec * , and * par * are usually from the _ hipparcos _ re - reduction of @xcite ; the @xmath31 ( * bmv * ) values are from the _ hipparcos _ catalog by @xcite ; stellar magnitudes * j * , * h * , and * ks * ( i.e.  @xmath38 ) are from the 2mass catalog @xcite ( as reported in simbad ) and the * kp * ( i.e.  @xmath39 ) magnitudes are from the exoplanet archive @xcite .    * shk * and * rhk * represent the mount wilson s and @xmath40 chromospheric emission measures . these fields are poorly maintained fields and unreferenced , at the moment .",
    "we plan to include proper reference in the future .",
    "most of the shk and rhk values are from @xcite , and individual discovery papers .",
    "we removed 2 fields since @xcite :    the * sptype * field previously reported the stellar type of the host star .",
    "we have removed it since it can be difficult to verify with peer - reviewed references , and the field was not well maintained .",
    "we encourage users to use teff and bmv instead .",
    "the * nstedid * field reported i d of host star in nsted , and now it is replaced by eaname , which is the name of the star as appears on the nasa s exoplanet archive @xcite .",
    "since @xcite ,  has discovered many exoplanet candidates , and more planets have been robustly discovered by various other methods , although not all have very well characterized orbits .",
    "we have expanded the ede to include those planets for the convenience of our users , and also to keep exoplanets.org complete in terms of confirmed exoplanets .",
    "we now provide an option for users to include the kois discovered by  in the ede .",
    "although kois are not counted as part of the eod due to their status of being  candidates \" , we include them on our website so that these kois are put into the context of all confirmed exoplanets .",
    "we have used broad definitions for sep and mass so that they may be compared to eod planets , even though they share few strictly defined parameters .",
    "the kois listed in our table include three  data releases ( as of july 2014 ) , and exoplanets.org always provides the most up - to - date release through a partnership with the nasa exoplanet archive .    to display the kois in the ede table",
    ", users can check the  kepler \" option on the upper left of the table ( the default selection only includes  orbit database \" , i.e.  the eod , and  other \" ) .",
    "they can also be displayed on plots with the interactive plotting tool of ede ( see figure  [ fig : koi ] for an example plot ) .",
    "all kois with a disposition other than `` false positive '' are included in the ede .",
    "we now also include robustly detected imaging , microlensing , and timing planets .",
    "our criteria for a `` robust detection '' for these planets are the following :    * imaging planets : 1 .",
    "planet - star mass ratio @xmath41 ( @xmath42  for a solar mass star ) ; and in general we require ( @xmath43 ) @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the uncertainty in @xmath46 .",

    "some of the exoplanets that are primarily detected by these methods do not have well - determined orbital parameters , and thus they are categorized as `` other planets '' on exoplanets.org instead of being in the eod .",
    "these planets can be displayed by check the ` other ' option for the ede table .",
    "as of july 2014 , no microlensing or imaging planets ( except @xmath2 pictoris ) appear in the eod , while several timing exoplanets have well - determined orbital parameters and are included in the eod .",

    "the software stack powering the eod remains largely unchanged from @xcite .",
    "the backend server is now written in ruby , instead of python , but the thin role it plays is largely unchanged .",
    "the javascript frontend that runs on the browser has recently been optimized to support the larger datasets arising from the kepler missions . in particular , the eod table now only renders cells that are visible on - screen .",

    "2 .   tables may be generated and exported with custom fields computed .",
    "plots may be exported with a variety of resolutions and aspects , including publication - quality vector graphics ( svg format ) .",
    "we have had two major updates since @xcite .",
    "first , we expanded the scope of the eod .",
    "we removed the requirement for the host star being normal and included the planets discovered not only by rv and transit but also by various other methods ( e.g. timing ) in the eod .",
    "we also have added some new fields , most notably , we now report the secondary eclipse depths .",
    "we removed obsolete fields and revised some fields as necessary .",
    "we have included sep and mass with broad definitions so all planets may be plotted on common axes .",
    "second , we included kois and other planets ( the ones detected by microlensing , imaging , timing , and in the future , astrometry but do not have well characterized orbits ) on exoplanets.org . although they are not included in the eod , we reported them on our website since the users might find them useful for purposes of statistical studies and comparison .    in the future ,",
    "we hope to include images of directly imaged planets and light curves for transits and microlensing planets .",
    "we plan to display rv curves whenever their rv data are available and include better incorporation of kepler parameters in the eod ( such as kepid ) .",
    "we also plan to report the upper limits ( xul ) for planet minimum mass ( msini ) , eccentricity ( ecc ) , and the radial velocity semi - amplitude ( k ) when the literature reports them .",
    "for example , an upper limit for ecc is reported when the orbit is consistent with a circular one , and the upper limit for k is reported when there is only a null result from radial velocities .",
    "since not all authors define the upper limits in the same way ( e.g. 1@xmath36 or some fixed percentile ) , we encourage the users to refer to the original references for more information .",
    "we will also include proper rendering of upper limits in the ede table , proper upper limit symbols in the plotter , and proper handling of upper limits in filters and queries in both cases .",
