    "@xmath8 is the interaction potential between the particles , which we assume to be smooth and fastly decaying at infinity .",
    "the starting point of @xcite was the observation that has many stationary states .",
    "indeed , if @xmath9 is such that @xmath10 then the operator @xmath11 ( the fourier multiplier by @xmath12 ) is a bounded self - adjoint operator which commutes with @xmath13 and whose density @xmath14 is constant .",
    "hence , for @xmath15 , @xmath16 is also constant , and @xmath17=0 $ ] .",
    "therefore @xmath18 is a stationary solution to .",
    "the purpose of  @xcite and of this article is to investigate the stability of these stationary states , under `` local perturbations '' .",
    "we do not necessarily think of small perturbations in norm , but we typically think of @xmath19 being compact .",
    "the simplest choice is @xmath20 which corresponds to the vacuum case .",
    "we are interested here in the case of @xmath21 , describing an infinite , homogeneous gas containing infinitely many particles and with positive constant density @xmath22 .",
    "four important physical examples are the    @xmath23 _ fermi gas at zero temperature _ : @xmath24    @xmath23 _ fermi gas at positive temperature @xmath25 _ : @xmath26    @xmath23 _ bose gas at positive temperature @xmath25 _ : @xmath27    @xmath23 _ boltzmann gas at positive temperature @xmath25 _ : @xmath28 in the density matrix formalism , the number of particles in the system is given by @xmath29 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath30 in the previous examples since @xmath31 is a translation - invariant ( hence non - compact ) operator .",
    "because they contain infinitely many particles , these systems also have an infinite energy . in @xcite",
    ", we proved the existence of global solutions to the equation   in the defocusing case @xmath32 , when the initial datum @xmath33 has a finite _ relative energy _ counted with respect to the stationary states @xmath31 given in   , in dimensions @xmath34 .",
    "we also proved the orbital stability of @xmath31 .    in this work ,",
    "we are interested in the _ asymptotic stability _ of @xmath31 . as usual for schrdinger equations",
    ", we can not expect strong convergence in norm and we will rather prove that @xmath35 weakly as @xmath36 , if the initial datum @xmath33 is small enough .",
    "physically , this means that a small defect added to the translation - invariant state @xmath31 disappears for large times due to dispersive effects , and the system locally relaxes towards the homogeneous gas .",
    "more precisely , we are able to describe the exact behavior of @xmath3 for large times , by proving that @xmath37 strongly in a schatten space ( hence for instance for the operator norm ) .",
    "this nonlinear scattering result means that the perturbation @xmath38 of the homogeneous gas evolves for large times as in the case of free particles : @xmath39    if @xmath20 and @xmath40 is a rank - one orthogonal projection , then   reduces to the well - known hartree equation for one function @xmath41 there is a large literature about scattering for the nonlinear equation  , see for instance @xcite .",

    "4 ) ) . for a general @xmath1",
    ", our main result requires that the interaction potential @xmath8 is small enough , in order to control the linear term . under the natural assumption that @xmath1 is strictly decreasing ( as it is in the three physical examples   ) ,",
    "the condition can be weakened in the defocusing case @xmath32 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we state our main result and make several comments . in section  [ sec : linear - response ] we study the linear response in detail , before turning to the higher order terms in the expansion of the wave operator in section  [ sec : higher - order ] . apart from the linear response , our method requires to treat separately the next @xmath47 terms of this expansion , in spacial dimension @xmath48 .",
    "even if all the other estimates are valid in any dimension , in this paper we only deal with the second order in dimension @xmath49 .",
    "in the whole paper , we denote by @xmath50 the space of bounded operators on the hilbert space @xmath51 .",
    "the corresponding operator norm is @xmath52 .",

    "we refer to  @xcite for the properties of schatten spaces .",
    "the spaces @xmath58 and @xmath59 correspond to hilbert - schmidt and trace - class operators .",
    "we often use the shorthand notation @xmath60 and @xmath61 when the hilbert space @xmath51 is clear from the context .",

    "first we notice that the gases at positive temperature  ,   and   are all covered by the theorem with the condition  , since the corresponding @xmath1 is smooth , strictly decreasing and exponentially decaying at infinity .",
    "our result does not cover the fermi gas at zero temperature  , however .",
    "we show in section  [ sec : linear - response ] that its linear response is unbounded and it is a challenging task to better understand its dynamical stability .",
    "the next remark concerns the assumption   which says that the interactions must be small or , equivalently , that the gas must contain few particles having a small momentum ( if @xmath85 , then the condition can be written @xmath86 and hence @xmath87 must be small for small @xmath88 ) .",
    "our method does not work without the condition   if no other information on @xmath8 and @xmath1 is provided .",
    "however , under the natural additional assumption that @xmath1 is strictly decreasing , we can replace the condition   by the weaker condition  .",
    "the latter says that the negative part of @xmath89 and the value at zero of the positive part should be small ( with a better constant for the latter ) .",
    "we will explain later where the condition   comes from , but we mention already that we are not able to deal with an arbitrary large potential @xmath89 in a neighborhood of the origin , even in the defocusing case .",
    "we also recall that the focusing or defocusing character of our equation is governed by the sign of @xmath89 and not of @xmath8 , as it is for  .",
    "this is seen from the sign of the nonlinear term @xmath90 which appears in the relative energy of the system ( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  ( 9)(10 ) ) ) .",
    "let us mention that our results hold for _ small _ initial data , where the smallness is not only qualitative ( meaning that @xmath91 for instance ) , but also quantitative since we need that @xmath92 be small enough .",
    "this is a well - known restriction , coming from our method of proof , based on a fixed point argument .",
    "the literature on nonlinear schrdinger equations suggests that , in order to remove this smallness assumption , one would need some assumption on @xmath8 like @xmath32 , as well as some additional ( almost ) conservation laws @xcite .",
    "our study of the linear response operator however indicates that the situation is involved and more information on the momentum distribution @xmath1 is certainly also necessary .",
    "we finally note that in our previous article  @xcite , we proved the existence of global solutions under the assumption that the initial state @xmath33 has a finite relative entropy with respect to @xmath31 ( and for @xmath1 being one of the physical examples  ) . by the lieb - thirring inequality",
    "( see  @xcite and  @xcite ) , this implies that @xmath93 . by interpolation",
    "we therefore get that @xmath94 for every @xmath95 .",
    "this requires of course that the initial perturbation @xmath96 be small in @xmath97 .",
    "our method does not allow to replace this condition by the fact that @xmath33 has a small relative entropy with respect to @xmath31 .",
    "we now explain our strategy for proving theorem  [ thm : main ] .",
    "the idea of the proof relies on a fixed point argument , in the spirit of ( * ? ? ?",

    "a similar technique was used for the dirac sea in  @xcite . in order to be able to invert the fourier multiplier @xmath120 , we need that @xmath126 then @xmath127 is invertible if @xmath119 is small enough . in section  [ sec : linear - response ]",
    "we prove the simple estimate @xmath128 and this leads to our condition  . if @xmath1 is strictly decreasing , then we are able to prove that the imaginary part of @xmath129 is never 0 for @xmath130 or @xmath131 .",

    "it is an interesting open question to understand the asymptotic stability of the fermi sea .",
