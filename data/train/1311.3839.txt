    "the symmetry of the shape or alignment of meta - atoms affects the electromagnetic response of metamaterials .",
    "a group - theoretical method of treating symmetry in metamaterials has been developed and applied for designing and optimizing metamaterials.@xcite this method has also been utilized for designing two - dimensional metamaterials , called _",
    "metasurfaces_.@xcite however , these studies dealt only with groups of isometries with a fixed point , that is to say , _",
    "point groups_.    in addition to isometric symmetry of metamaterials , the theory of electromagnetism has another symmetry with respect to the interchange of electric and magnetic fields .",
    "this symmetry is called the _ electromagnetic duality _ , and can be generalized to a continuous symmetry with respect to internal rotations of electric and magnetic fields .",
    "this continuous symmetry is directly related to a helicity conservation law.@xcite we note that these symmetries had been gradually discovered since the late 19th century.@xcite    the electromagnetic duality is closely related to babinet s principle.@xcite given a thin metallic metasurface , we can construct the complementary metasurface by using a structural inversion to interchange the holes and the metals .",
    "babinet s principle relates the scattering fields of the complementary metasurfaces to those of the original one .",
    "this principle is based on the fact that the structural inversion is consistent with electromagnetic duality . a rigorous babinet s principle for electromagnetic waves",

    "such self - complementary artificial surfaces have been used for efficient polarizers.@xcite in the field of antenna design , it is known that a self - complementary antenna has a constant input impedance.@xcite therefore , self - complementary metasurfaces are expected to exhibit a frequency - independent response . it has been shown that an almost self - complementary spiral terahertz metasurface has a constant response only in the high - frequency range.@xcite there have been some efforts to achieve a frequency - independent response with self - complementary checkerboard metasurfaces,@xcite but it is known empirically that such a metasurface does not exist .",
    "self - complementary metasurfaces have not been analyzed thoroughly enough ; for example , conditions for the frequency - independent response have not been discussed thoroughly , and an elaborate theory is needed . in this paper , we study electromagnetic scattering by self - complementary metasurfaces more rigorously and establish several useful theorems . in particular , we focus on the incidences of circularly polarized plane waves onto self - complementary metasurfaces , because circularly polarized light matches with electromagnetic duality .",
