    "a broad absorption band due to the si - o stretching mode in amorphous silicates , centered at 9.7@xmath0 m , is also commonly detected in galaxies . since the center of the silicate absorption coincides with a gap between the 6.28.6@xmath0 m and 11.312.8@xmath0 m pah complexes , it is not readily apparent whether a 9.7@xmath0 m flux minimum should be interpreted as the `` trough '' between pah emission features or as strong silicate absorption , or as a combination of the two . in spectra",
    "observed towards heavily extincted galactic lines of sight , a strong silicate feature is often accompanied by ice absorption features in the 68@xmath0 m region ( e.g. whittet et al .",

    "+ ngc4418 is well - known for its deep 9.7@xmath0 m silicate feature ( roche et al .",

    "the iras colors of ngc4418 indicate that  unlike most other galaxies  the 12100@xmath0 m emission of ngc4418 is dominated by a warm dust component , peaking shortward of 60@xmath0 m ( see fig.[mirfir_sed ] ) .",
    "vla radio maps at 6 and 20 cm ( condon et al . @xcite ; eales et al .",
    "@xcite ) show ngc4418 to be compact ( 70pc@xmath850pc at most ) .",

    "we present mid - ir spectral evidence lending further support for the presence of an agn in ngc4418 .",
    "a low resolution ( @xmath11/@xmath1290 ) iso - pht - s spectrum of the central 24@xmath1324@xmath1 of ngc4418 was obtained on 1996 july 14 as part of a project on the interstellar medium of normal galaxies ( helou et al .",
    "the measurement was carried out in triangular chopped mode , using a chopper throw of 150@xmath1 .",
    "the resulting spectrum is thus free of contributions from zodiacal light .",
    "the iso - pht - s data were reduced using pia 8.2 .",
    "the absolute calibration is accurate to within 20% .",

    "+ in fig.[mirfir_sed ] we compile the 13000@xmath0 m ( spectro)photometric observations of ngc4418 , including the new , standard reduced , iso - pht - s , iso - cam and iso - lws observations .",
    "stellar emission probably dominates the near - ir regime up to 4@xmath0 m , beyond which a strong mid - infrared continuum sets in .",
    "the sed reveals that a substantial part of the emission emanates from optically thick warm dust ( roche & chandler @xcite ; lisenfeld et al .",
    "@xcite ) , peaking at 4060@xmath0 m . also shown in fig.[mirfir_sed ]",
    "are two equally possible choices of local continuum which we have adopted to analyse the ice , hydrogenated amorphous carbon ( hac ) and silicate absorption .",
    "this will be discussed in detail in section 3.2 .",
    "the mid - ir spectrum of ngc4418 ( fig.[mir_seds ] ) bears little resemblance to the spectrum of ( almost ) any other galaxy obtained by iso .",
    "the spectra of normal and starburst galaxies ( rigopoulou et al .",
    "@xcite ; helou et al .",

    "seyfert galaxies with a clear line of sight to agn - heated hot dust , on the other hand , are dominated by a strong mid - ir continuum with pahs barely recognizable ( clavel et al .",
    "the mid - ir spectrum of ngc4418 is rich in features but does not resemble pah spectra . rather it is similar to spectra observed towards heavily extincted galactic lines of sight , such as deeply embedded massive protostars or the galactic centre ( fig.[mir_seds ] ) .",
    "these show no evidence for pah emission features but do show strong absorption features .",
    "a simple criterion for the role of pah emission and absorption features is based on the location of maxima in the 67@xmath0 m region : pah spectra show the 6.2@xmath0 m emission feature , whereas absorption spectra show a peak at 6.56.7@xmath0 m , which is not an emission feature but a window of reduced absorption between two features",
    ".    a detailed comparison of the absorption features with galactic templates may be able to shed further light on the origin of the extinction in ngc4418 .",
    "the absorption features were determined by fitting a local polynomial to the peaks of the 5.88@xmath0 m spectrum of ngc4418 .",
    "the absence of the 6.2@xmath0 m pah feature indicates that emission features are very weak in the spectrum , and justifies this simple procedure to derive the shape and depth of the absorption features .",
    "fig.[ice_depths ] shows the resulting ngc4418 optical depth spectrum along with the optical depth spectrum of ices towards the massive protostar w33a ( gibb et al .",

    "the origins of the 6.85@xmath0 m and 7.3@xmath0 m bands in ngc4418 are unclear .",

    "as for the galactic centre , both ice characteristics for shielded dense molecular cloud environments and hac - like grain characteristics for diffuse ism dust seem to be present along the line of sight .",

    "the effect of the different continua on the silicate feature is noticable when fitting the silicate profile by the galactic centre source gcs3 , a pure absorption feature , i.e. no intrinsic emission ( figer et al .",
    "@xcite ) . however , the exact optical depth is still difficult to determine due to saturation of the silicate feature in ngc4418 . adopting the dotted line in figure[mirfir_sed ] results in a ngc4418 silicate profile",
    "in which the blue wing is well matched but the red wavelength wing is poorly fitted by the gcs3 profile . if however the dashed line is adopted , then the fit to the red wing improves while still maintaining a reasonable match to the blue wing of the 10@xmath0 m silicate band .",
    "the 9.7@xmath0 m and 18@xmath0 m optical depths for the second case are @xmath257 ( corresponding to a@xmath10130 ) and @xmath261.5 .",
    "these numbers , along with the derived hydrogen column density , are shown in table1 .",
    "the apparent optical depth ratio of the 9.7/18@xmath0 m silicate bands , regardless of adopted continuum , is significantly larger than the ratio determined by demyk et al .",

    "we have compared the iso - pht - s spectrum of ngc4418 with spectra of our template sources and found no sign of pah emission , neither from the nucleus , nor from that part of the disk contained within the 24@xmath1324@xmath1 iso - pht - s aperture .",
    "instead we found deep absorption features imposed upon a featureless mid - ir continuum .",
    "we identify the 68@xmath0 m absorption features with foreground ices and hac - like grains .",
    "+ the nature of the central source in ngc4418 can not be infered from the observed mid- to far - ir spectrum alone , given the absence of any `` signposts '' , like the 6.2@xmath0 m pah emission feature ( f@xmath276@xmath810@xmath28w/@xmath29 ) , and of fine structure lines ( @xmath30@xmath31 $ ] , @xmath30@xmath31 $ ] and @xmath30@xmath31 $ ] , malhotra et al .",

    "both a heavily enshrouded agn or a similarly extincted nuclear starburst could be responsible for the observed continuum . even if a starburst could be accomodated within the compact central source ( @xmath3370pc in the mid - ir ( scoville et al .",
    "@xcite ) and 2570pc at 6 and 20 cm ( eales et al . @xcite ; kawara et al .",
    "@xcite ) ) , it would be highly unlikely to block the escape of any mid - ir starburst indicator from a region of that size .",

    "far - ir to millimetre sizes are less well constrained but the warm iras colours suggest that the emission in this range also arises in the nuclear region .",
    "+ our finding of strong absorptions due to cold silicates and ices in ngc4418 leads us to believe that the same absorptions may be present in the mid - ir spectra of other galaxies . indeed , we have found similar absorptions in about a dozen of 225 galaxies observed spectroscopically by iso .",
    "spectral identifications have to be done with great care since simultaneous presence of pah emission makes other spectra more complex than the one of ngc4418 .",
    "+ since the overall shape of the ngc4418 611@xmath0 m spectrum with its maximum near 8@xmath0 m mimicks at first glance a pah spectrum , we point out the need for high s / n spectra to clearly identify the indicators for bona fide pah spectra or absorption dominated spectra .",
    "the most obvious discriminator is the 6.2@xmath0 m pah peak to be contrasted with the 6.56.7@xmath0 m pseudo - maximum in absorption spectra , which is due to a window between two absorption features . in a forthcoming paper",
