    "investigations focusing on global changes in star - formation activity and stellar - mass build - up in field galaxies have provided significant insight into the physical evolution of galaxies and their constituent stellar populations .",
    "it has now been well - established that the global star - formation rate density has declined by roughly an order of magnitude since @xmath7  11.5 ( e.g. , lilly  1996 ; madau  1996 ; steidel  1999 ; hopkins  2004 ; prez - gonzlez  2005 ; schiminovich  2005 ; colbert 2006 ) .",
    "recent investigations into the details of this evolution have shown that the star - formation history of a given galaxy depends strongly on its stellar mass ( e.g. , cowie  1996 ; juneau  2005 ; bundy  2006 ; noeske  2007a , b ; zheng  2007 ) ; the peak star - formation epoch for the most massive galaxies occured earlier in cosmic history than it did for galaxies with lower masses .",
    "x - ray studies of normal late - type galaxies ( i.e. , those that are not dominated by luminous active galactic nuclei [ agns ] ) have shown that  emission provides a useful , relatively - unobscured measure of star - formation activity ( e.g. , bauer  2002a ; cohen  2003 ; ranalli  2003 ; colbert 2004 ; grimm  2003 ; gilfanov  2004a ; persic  2004 ; persic & rephaeli 2007 ; however , see barger  2007 ) . in normal galaxies ,",
    "emission originates from  binaries , supernovae , supernova remnants , hot ( @xmath0 ) interstellar gas , and o - stars ( see , e.g. , fabbiano  1989 , 2006 for reviews ) .",
    "sensitive  and  studies of local late - type galaxies have shown that high - mass  binaries ( hmxbs ) and low - mass binaries ( lmxbs ) typically dominate the total non - nuclear  power output ( e.g. , zezas  2002 ; bauer  2003 ; soria & wu  2003 ; swartz 2003 ; jenkins  2005 ; kilgard  2005 ; however , see , e.g. , doane  2004 ) .",
    "observations indicate that the integrated  emission from hmxb and lmxb populations trace galaxy star - formation rate ( sfr ) and stellar mass ( @xmath3 ) , respectively .",
    "for example , using  observations of 32 local galaxies , colbert  ( 2004 ) found that the summed non - nuclear point - source emission from a given galaxy ( @xmath8 ) can be approximated as , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are constants .",
    "therefore , galaxies having relatively high star - formation rates per unit mass ( specific star - formation rates , ssfrs ) generally have dominant point - source contributions from hmxbs ( e.g. , late - type star - forming galaxies ) , while those with relatively low ssfrs have point - source emission primarily from lmxbs ( e.g. , massive early - type galaxies ) .",
    "if the  binary populations are similarly dominating the normal - galaxy  power output over a significant fraction of cosmic time , then there should be a rapid increase in the globally - averaged  luminosity of normal star - forming galaxies with cosmic look - back time in response to the increasing global star - formation rate density ( e.g. , ghosh & white 2001 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "hmxbs trace the immediate star - formation rate of a galaxy and lmxbs trace its star - formation history with a lag of a few gyr . with the advent of deep  and  surveys ( see , e.g. , brandt & hasinger 2005 for a review ) , it has become possible to study the  properties of normal galaxies out to @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively ( see , e.g. , hornschemeier  2000 , 2003 ; alexander  2002 ; georgakakis 2007 ; georgantopoulos  2005 ; lehmer  2006 , 2007 ; kim  2006 ; tzanavaris  2006 ; rosa - gonzalez  2007 ) .",
    "evidence for a global increase in the  activity with redshift for normal late - type galaxies has since been mounting .",
    "studies of the  luminosity functions of detected normal galaxies have found that @xmath13 evolves as over the redshift range @xmath7  01.4 ( e.g. , norman  2004 ; georgakakis  2006 ; ptak  2007 ; tzanavaris & georgantopolous 2008 ) .",
    "additionally ,  stacking analyses have enabled investigations of more representative optically - selected galaxy populations over the majority of cosmic history ( @xmath7  0.14 ; e.g. , brandt  2001 ; hornschemeier  2002 ; nandra  2002 ; georgakakis  2003 ; reddy & steidel 2004 ; laird  2005 , 2006 ; lehmer  2005a ) .",
    "these studies have found that the average  luminosities of normal late - type galaxies increases with redshift out to @xmath7  1.43 .",
    "for example , using a @xmath01  ms exposure of a subregion within the  deep field - north , hornschemeier  ( 2002 , hereafter h02 ) tentatively observed a factor of @xmath023 increase in @xmath14 from @xmath15 to 1.4 for @xmath16 galaxies . despite these promising initial constraints , the details of the evolution of normal late - type galaxy populations , including dependences on the physical properties of galaxies ( e.g. ,",
    "optical luminosity , stellar mass , environment , and star - formation rate ) , have remained unexplored .    in this paper",
    ", we aim to improve significantly upon constraints for the evolution of normal late - type galaxies ( e.g. , h02 ) .",
    "we study for the first time how the  properties of late - type field galaxies evolve as a function of optical luminosity , stellar mass , and star - formation rate over the redshift range of @xmath17  .",
    "we construct late - type galaxy samples located in two of the most well - studied extragalactic  survey fields , the @xmath02 ms _ chandra _ deep field - north (; alexander  2003 ) and the extended  deep field - south ( ) , which is composed of the central @xmath01 ms  deep field - south ( cdf - s ; giacconi  2002 ) and four flanking @xmath0250  ks  observations ( lehmer  2005b ) .",
    "these  deep fields ( hereafter cdfs ) reach detection limits of @xmath0@xmath18  in the most sensitive regions and @xmath19@xmath20  over the majority of the cdfs ; these levels are sufficient to detect moderately - powerful  sources ( @xmath21  ) at @xmath1 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the cdfs comprise an unprecedented data set for effectively studying the  emission and evolution of cosmologically distant normal galaxies with minimal contamination from powerful agns .",
    "the galactic column densities are @xmath23  @xmath24 for the ( lockman 2004 ) and @xmath25  @xmath24 for the  ( stark 1992 ) .",
    "all of the fluxes and luminosities quoted throughout this paper have been corrected for galactic absorption . unless stated otherwise , we quote optical magnitudes based upon the ab magnitude system for photometry and the vega magnitude system everywhere else . in the  band ,",
    "we make use of three standard bandpasses : ( soft band [ sb ] ) , ( hard band [ hb ] ) , ( full band [ fb ] ) . throughout this paper ,",
    "we make estimates of stellar mass and star - formation rates using a kroupa  ( 2001 ) initial mass function ( imf ) ; when making comparisons between these estimates and those quoted in other studies , we have adjusted all values to correspond to our adopted imf .",
    "@xmath26 = 70  , @xmath27 = 0.3 , and @xmath28 = 0.7 are adopted throughout this paper ( e.g. , spergel  2003 ) , which imply a look - back time of 7.7  gyr at @xmath29 .",
    "we constructed an optically selected sample of late - type galaxies within the cdfs to use for our subsequent analyses .",
    "we restricted our galaxy selection to regions of the cdfs where _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( ) observations were available to allow the best possible morphological classifications .",
    "the observations in the cdfs have been carried out via the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ; giavalisco  2004a ) and galaxy evolution from morphology and seds ( gems ; rix  2004 ; caldwell  2005 ) programs ; these surveys cover @xmath090% of the -observed regions of the cdfs with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) . in the goods and gems regions , photometry was available for four ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 ) and two ( @xmath31 and @xmath33 ) acs passbands , respectively .",
    "we began building our sample by selecting all galaxies having @xmath34 .",
    "this initial selection criterion was motivated by ( 1 ) the availability of deep @xmath33 band imaging over all of the cdfs , ( 2 ) the fact that the @xmath33 emission probes mass - tracing rest - frame optical light redward of the 4000    break for galaxies at @xmath35 , which constitutes the large majority of our sample , ( 3 ) the availability of reliable spectroscopic and photometric redshifts ( see details below ) , and ( 4 ) the high multiwavelength detection fractions for these sources , which allow us to determine informative rest - frame spectral energy distributions ( seds ) . in order to isolate most effectively distant detected agns , we further restricted our sample to include only galaxies that were located in the most sensitive areas of the cdfs where the point - spread function ( psf ) was small .",
    "we therefore chose to include sources having optical positions that were within 60 of at least one of the six  aimpoints in the cdfs2  ms  and @xmath01  ms , respectively , as well as table  1 of lehmer  ( 2005b ) for the @xmath0250  ks . ] ; the corresponding total areal footprint is @xmath00.18",
    "futhermore , we removed obvious galactic stars that were identified via optical spectral properties or the presence of obvious diffraction spikes in the @xmath33 band images . under these restrictions , we found 6905 galaxies .",
    "we cross - correlated our initial sample of 6905 galaxies with available spectroscopic and photometric redshift catalogs ( e.g. , barger  2003 ; le  fevre  2004 ; szokoly  2004 ; wirth  2004 ; wolf  2004 ; mobasher  2004 ; mignoli  2005 ; vanzella  2005 , 2006 ; grazian  2006 ; ravikumar  2007 ; silverman  2008 ) .",
    "all galaxies that did not have spectroscopic redshifts were located in the  where highly accurate ( median @xmath37 for galaxies with @xmath38 ) photometric redshifts were available via combo-17 ( classifying objects by medium - band observations in 17 filters ; wolf  2004 ) . in total , 6683 ( @xmath097% ) of our sources had either spectroscopic or photometric redshifts .",
    "visual inspection of the 222 galaxies in the  without redshifts indicated that these sources were mainly faint galaxies near bright stars , as well as a handful of sources that were subgalactic features within relatively nearby galaxies .    whenever possible , we adopted spectroscopic redshifts as the most accurate redshifts for our galaxies . using the redshift information ,",
    "we filtered our sample to include only sources with @xmath39 in the @xmath02  ms , @xmath40 in the @xmath01  ms , and @xmath41 in the @xmath0250  ks regions of the ; these redshift limits represent the largest distances at which we would expect to identify moderately luminous ( @xmath42  ) agns effectively in each respective field . in total , 3259 galaxies remained after filtering our sample based on redshift properties .",
    "we used spectroscopic redshifts for 1351 ( @xmath041% ) galaxies and photometric redshifts for the remaining 1908 ( @xmath059% ) galaxies .",
    "the optical - color distribution for field galaxies has been shown to be bimodal , separating `` red '' and `` blue '' galaxy populations ( e.g. , strateva  2001 ; hogg  2002a ; blanton  2003 ; baldry  2004 ) .",
    "studies of the color - magnitude relation for distant galaxy populations have shown that this color bimodality is observed to persist out to at least ( see , e.g. , bell  2004a ; faber  2007 ; labbe 2007 ) , thus providing an excellent quantifiable means for separating late - type and early - type galaxy populations .",
    "we therefore filtered our galaxy sample to include only sources that had blue rest - frame optical colors , as expected for late - type galaxies that contain young stellar populations . to estimate rest - frame @xmath43 colors and absolute @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 band magnitudes ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 , respectively ) for each of the 3259 galaxies in our sample",
    ", we utilized the available optical / near - ir data .",
    "for the , we used the @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 photometric catalogs from capak  ( 2004 ) , as well as  irac imaging ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0@xmath54 m ; fazio  2004 ) from the goods ( dickinson , in preparation ) .",
    "for the , we used ( 1 ) the 17-bandpass photometry available through combo-17 , ( 2 ) @xmath55 and @xmath56 imaging from the eso imaging survey ( olsen  2006 ) , ( 3 ) @xmath55 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 from the musyc collaboration ( taylor  in preparation ; see also , moy  2003 ; gawiser  2006 ) , and ( 4 )  irac data from the goods and simple teams ( dickinson , in preparation ; van  dokkum , in preparation ) . using these data , we constructed a rest - frame near - uv  to  near - ir sed for each galaxy .",
    "for these seds , the rest - frame @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 filters are well - sampled at all relevant redshifts , with the exception of sources at @xmath59 where the wavelength range of the available data is sparse at rest - frame @xmath46 band . for sources at @xmath60 , we linearly interpolated our sed to cover the @xmath46 filter .",
    "we convolved these seds with johnson @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 filter curves and computed rest - frame absolute magnitudes for each respective filter following equation  5 of hogg  ( 2002b ) . for sources in the",

    ", we also show inset histograms giving the distribution of rest - frame @xmath43 colors for each redshift interval .",
    "we utilized the rest - frame @xmath43 color to divide roughly populations of red and blue galaxies .",
    "use of the rest - frame @xmath43 color was motivated by bell  ( 2004a ) , who note that the @xmath44 and @xmath46 bandpass pair straddle the 4000    break , which is particularly sensitive to age and metallicity variations of galactic stellar populations .",
    "the dashed lines in figure  1 show the empirically - determined redshift - dependent color divisions that separate blue and red galaxy populations ; we calculated these divisions following @xmath61  5 of bell  ( 2004a ) : @xmath62 galaxies having rest - frame @xmath43 less than the values provided by equation  1 are often referred to as `` blue - cloud '' galaxies , while those with rest - frame @xmath43 greater than the division are called `` red - sequence '' galaxies .",
    "the redshift - dependence of the blue - cloud / red - sequence galaxy division is thought to be largely due to the evolution of the mean age and dust content of the blue - cloud population , with a smaller contribution from changes in metallicity . in total",
    ", we found 2502 blue - cloud galaxies and 757 red - sequence galaxies .",
    "generally , the blue - cloud and red - sequence populations are composed of late - type and early - type galaxies , respectively ( see , e.g. , bell  2004b , 2005 ; mcintosh  2005 ) . in support of this point",
    ", we have created figure  2 , which shows the fraction of  galaxies in our sample having blue - cloud ( _ dashed histogram _ ) and red - sequence ( _ dotted histogram _ ) colors as a function of galaxy srsic index @xmath63 .",

    "galaxies with @xmath66 are generally late - type galaxies , while the majority of galaxies with @xmath67 are early - types ( _ vertical line _ in fig .  2 ) .",

    "for example , late - type galaxies that are highly inclined to our line of sight may experience significant reddening of the young ( and blue ) disk population and will have red - sequence colors . also , due to variations of the stellar populations in galaxies of a given morphological class , there will be some scatter in rest - frame @xmath43 color near the division of the red - sequence and blue - cloud regimes .",
    "this will lead to a number of `` green '' galaxies that are misclassified morphologically when the classification is based solely on rest - frame color .",
    "we stress that such a visual inspection is only to correct source classifications that were _ obviously misclassified _ by simply using color - magnitude diagrams , and our resulting sample should not be considered a morphologically - selected sample .",
    "based on our visual inspection , we found 76 obvious early - type galaxies with blue - cloud colors , and 142 obvious late - type galaxies with red - sequence colors ; we reclassified these sources as late - type and early - type galaxies , respectively .",
    "we inspected histograms of the fraction of blue - cloud and red - sequence galaxies that were reclassified as a function of redshift and find no obvious redshift - related trend . in figure  3 , we show @xmath33-band postage - stamp images of ten obvious early - type galaxies with blue - cloud colors ( _ top panels _ ) , as well as ten obvious late - type galaxies with red - sequence colors ( _ bottom panels _ ) . after reclassifying these objects ,",

    ", we hereafter refer to our sample of 2568 late - type galaxies as our _ main sample _ , which we use in subsequent analyses .",
    "the primary goal of this study is to investigate the  evolution of normal ( i.e. , non - agn ) late - type galaxies and to determine how this evolution depends upon three intrinsic physical properties : optical luminosity , stellar mass , and star - formation rate .",
    "below , we describe how we estimated each of these physical properties for the galaxies in our main sample .",
    "we note that the populations of late - type galaxies that we are investigating here have been selected via their intrinsic physical properties , which may have changed significantly from the observed epoch to the present day .",
    "for example , it is expected that a significant fraction of the late - type galaxies in our main sample will evolve into early - type galaxies via mergers or passive stellar evolution ( e.g. , bell  2007 ) .",
    "ideally , we would like to study the evolution of the  properties of late - type galaxies while controlling for such changes in the physical nature of each galaxy .",
    "however , since the details of this evolution are highly complex and not well understood for a given galaxy , such a task is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we therefore investigate the  evolution of normal late - type galaxy populations in relation to their observed intrinsic physical properties .      in order to study late - type galaxy samples",
    "selected using an observable quantity , we made use of the @xmath45-band luminosity ( @xmath2 ) . in @xmath61  2.3 , we computed absolute @xmath45-band magnitudes @xmath48 for galaxies in our main sample using photometrically - derived seds . the @xmath45-band emission from a given late - type galaxy",

    "we added source counts and exposure times from all appropriate images and exposure maps , respectively ; however , there were very few sources in our main sample that met this criterion .    using background maps ( see @xmath61  4.2 of alexander  2003 for the @xmath02  ms  and @xmath01  ms  and @xmath61  4 of lehmer  2005b for the @xmath0250  ks ) and exposure maps , we measured local backgrounds @xmath189 and exposure times @xmath190 within a 30  pixel  @xmath191  30  pixel ( @xmath0@xmath192 ) square , centered on each source with the 15 radius circle masked out . here again , if a source was within 60 of more than one of the cdf aimpoints , we summed the local backgrounds and exposure times .",
