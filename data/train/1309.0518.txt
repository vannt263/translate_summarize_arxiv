    "correlated electron materials with geometrically frustrated lattice structures hold great promise for novel quantum electronic states . in addition to the quantum spin liquid @xcite observed in @xmath4-organics @xcite near the mott transition at half - filling , the sodium cobaltates na@xmath5coo@xmath6 exhibit rich and unconventional phases @xcite in a wide range of electron doping @xmath7 .",
    "central to the properties of the sodium cobaltates is the unconventional superconducting ( sc ) state observed near @xmath3 upon water intercalation @xcite . despite the intensive search for its possible electronic origin @xcite , the nature and pairing mechanism of the sc phase",
    "have been a controversial and unresolved issue .",
    "contrary to conventional wisdom , several experiments suggest that the many - electron ground state at superconducting concentrations may be in close proximity to certain hidden electronic ordered phases @xcite .",
    "although various ordered states have been conjectured near x=1/3 @xcite and argued to be relevant for superconductivity , almost all were based on the idea of coulomb jamming where a strong extended interaction @xmath8 drives a wigner crystal - like charge ordered insulating state with a large gap to single - particle excitations which is inconsistent with experiments . the nature and the microscopic origin of the textured electronic states if they exist , and the idea that electronic fluctuation mediated superconductivity arises in their proximity have remained enigmatic due to the lack of concrete understanding of the strong correlation effect and its interplay with geometric frustration in layered triangular lattice mott - hubbard systems .",
    "even for the simplest hubbard model , its possible electronic ground states as a function of doping have not been understood on the triangular lattice .    in this paper",
    ", we study the ground state properties and the phase diagram of the triangular lattice hubbard model .",
    "we show that , upon electron doping , new stable phases with textured charge and spin order ( both collinear and coplanar ) arise as a result of geometric frustration and strong correlation and provide insights to the cobaltate unconventional normal and sc states .",
    "specifically , we construct a spin - rotation invariant slave boson theory capable of describing both charge and noncollinear magnetic superstructures to study the ground states as a function of hubbard @xmath9 and electron doping @xmath7 .",
    "we find that adding electrons turns the frustrated 120@xmath2 nel ordered insulator at half - filling into a 3-sublattice noncollinear antiferromagnetic ( af ) metal which is stable at low - doping but undergoes a lifshitz transition accompanied by incipient charge ordering .",
    "the magnetic frustration begins to alleviate in the presence of charge inhomogeneity , and a novel af insulator emerges at @xmath3 where the unfrustrated collinear spin - density resides on the underlying honeycomb lattice sites and coexists with moderate @xmath0 charge density order .",
    "we obtain the phase diagram in the regime @xmath10 , discuss the nature of the phases and the phase transitions , and illustrate the evolution of the fermi surface ( fs ) .",
    "remarkably , the strongly correlated ground states near @xmath3 can be viewed as doping into the `` 1/3 af insulator '' , giving rise to metallic phases with small electron or hole fs pockets accommodating the excess carriers .",
    "we compare our findings to recent experiments and argue that the enhanced spin and charge fluctuations together with the narrowed quasiparticle band and the nested fs pockets may have important implications for the electronic origin of the sc phase in sodium cobaltates .",

    "to study the interplay between strong correlation and magnetic frustration , we use the kotliar - ruckenstein slave - boson formulation @xcite with full spin - rotation invariance @xcite .",
    "this strong - coupling theory correctly describes the weakly interacting limit ( @xmath18 ) , recovers and extends the gutzwiller approximation to the spin - rotation invariant case for all @xmath9 @xcite . by studying the spatially unrestricted solutions",
    ", we can probe inhomogeneous , textured electronic states induced by strong correlation and geometrical frustration @xcite .",
    "the local hilbert space of the hubbard model is represented by a spin-1/2 fermion @xmath19 and six bosons : @xmath20 ( holon ) , @xmath21 ( doublon ) , and @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) such that an empty site @xmath24 , a doubly occupied site @xmath25 , and a singly occupied site @xmath26 with sums over repeated spin indices .",

    "4b - d , surprisingly , the path toward the csco - afi above @xmath83 is interrupted by an incipient collinear ferrimagnetic metal ( c - frm ) phase at @xmath98 , where @xmath99@xmath100 increases ( decreases ) sharply such that @xmath101 and @xmath102 . to minimize frustration , the larger spin moment @xmath103 is af correlated with the smaller and parallel @xmath90 and @xmath104 ( @xmath105 , @xmath106 ) .",

    "we stress that the charge ordering necessary for the emergence of these textured states near @xmath3 arises from the lifshitz transition and is very different from the @xmath0 wigner crystal - like state driven by coulomb jamming due to a large next - nearest neighbor @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the `` 1/3 af insulator '' is different from the fully charge - disproportionate state with a large insulating gap proposed in lsda+u calculations @xcite . indeed , as shown in fig .",
    "5e , the small excitation gap in the csco - afi phase opens at @xmath83 and only reaches about @xmath116mev in the large-@xmath9 limit .",
    "it is remarkably that the spin - charge textured ground states occupy such a significant portion of the phase diagram around @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , the large-@xmath9 phase structure can be generically understood as either electron ( @xmath70 ) or hole ( @xmath117 ) doping into the corresponding `` 1/3 af insulator '' , leading to correlated metallic phase with nested electron or hole fs pockets in figs .",
    "3(b ) and 3(c ) .",
    "for example , for @xmath70 , the excess carriers give rise to the csco - afm metal phase with electron fs pockets centered around the zone corners . as shown in figs .",
    "3(c ) and 3(d ) , the latter grow with increasing @xmath7 until they touch and coalesce to trigger a transition into the uniform pm phase above @xmath118 in the phase diagram fig .  1",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the implications on the sodium cobaltates .",
    "theoretical estimates @xcite and the valence band resonant photoemission @xcite suggest @xmath119ev for the co @xmath21-electrons typical of @xmath120 transition metals . together with the bandwidth @xmath121ev , the value of @xmath122 puts the cobaltates near @xmath3 in the regime of the textured states on the phase diagram with small electron and/or hole fs pockets .",
    "there are experimental indications from arpes that the pm phase with the large @xmath17 fs is in proximity to such hidden ordered phases @xcite .",
    "moreover , quantum oscillations find remarkably small fs pockets at @xmath123 possibly due to electronic superstructures @xcite .",
    "the main reason that such states have not been widely observed in unhydrated cobaltates is likely due to the disordered na dopant ions @xcite .",
    "indeed , magnetic susceptibility measurements in thermally annealed samples around @xmath72 find evidence for a magnetic ordered state @xcite .",
    "we believe that water intercalation expands the c - axis and provides effective screening of the dopant potential , making the physical properties more suitable for the 2d triangular lattice hubbard model description .",
    "indeed , nmr experiments find that the principal effect of hydration is to reveal enhanced spin fluctuations at low temperatures , when compared to unhydrated single crystals at the same nominal na concentrations @xcite .",
    "more direct evidence supporting this view comes from hydrated samples at @xmath69 , where a specific heat anomaly observed at a critical temperature near @xmath124k was unaffected by a @xmath125 t magnetic field and identified as associated with density wave order @xcite .",
    "we thus propose that the cobaltates near @xmath3 are in proximity to such `` hidden '' textured phases with spin and charge order and the enhanced electronic fluctuations can mediate the sc pairing interaction .",
