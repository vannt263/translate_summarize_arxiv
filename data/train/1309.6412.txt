    "a honeycomb - structured two - dimensional atomic layer consisting of group iv atoms exhibits peculiar electronic properties due to a fact that electrons near the fermi level follow effectively the massless dirac equation ( wyle equation).@xcite a well - known and only unequivocally measured example is graphene where intriguing properties such as an anomalous quantum hall effect is observed.@xcite another element in group iv , si , which has sustained our modern life , should exhibit such fascinating properties,@xcite thus opening a new door to the next - generation technology with its pronounced relativistic effects related to the spin degrees of freedom.@xcite    however , no layered mother material such as graphite for graphene exists for si in nature .",
    "substrate materials are therefore indispensable to synthesize the honeycomb - structured si atomic layers ( silicene ) .",
    "hence the identification of silicene - substrate interactions and their roles in the electronic properties of silicene becomes a central issue in silicene science .",
    "experimentally , ag(111 ) surfaces are commonly used as such substrates and silicene layers on top are identified by scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) and spectroscopy ( sts ) measurements : the silicene mono - layers with the superperiodicities of 4@xmath14,@xcite @xmath2,@xcite and 2@xmath3 2@xmath4 @xcite with respect to 1 @xmath1 1 ag(111 ) surface are observed , and the simulated stm images of theoretically determined structures reproduce the observed images excellently.@xcite as for the electron states near the fermi level ( @xmath5 ) , however , the situation is controversial : angular - resolved photoelectron spectroscopy ( arpes ) measurements @xcite show the existence of the electron state with the linear energy dispersion ( dirac electron ) , whereas the density - functional calculations clarify the absence of dirac electrons due to the strong silicene - substrate interactions;@xcite it is of note that no landau - level sequences peculiar to dirac electrons have been observed.@xcite    the situation is further complicated for the newly found structure of silicene on ag(111 ) with the periodicity of @xmath6 with respect to the 1 @xmath1 1 silicene.@xcite from the interference patterns obtained by sts measurements , chen _ et al .",
    "_ claimed the presence of dirac electrons with the linear dispersion,@xcite whereas arafune _",
    "_ deduced the contrary conclusion of the absence of dirac electrons from essentially identical sts experiments.@xcite chen _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite also claimed the flip - flop motion between the two stable @xmath4 structures to explain their hexagonal symmetry stm images at higher temperature and its freeze at lower temperature . yet their evaluated energy barrier for the flip - flop motion , 38 mev per si atom obtained by the density - functional calculations using vasp code,@xcite is too large to explain the frozen temperature 40 k. they also argued that the dispersion force , or van der waals ( vdw ) force , is essential to obtain the rhombic @xmath4 structure.@xcite however , this seems to be inconsistent with the formation of the covalent bonds for other stable structures.@xcite recently , other experimental observations indicated that the existence of @xmath6 monolayer ( ml ) silicene on ag(111 ) is questionable , and suggested that chen s observation should correspond to the bilayer ( bl ) silicene.@xcite    in this work , we focus on the @xmath6 silicene on ag(111 ) and identify the observed structure on the basis of the extensive density - functional calculations .",
    "our results clearly contradict the existence of bistability between two rhombic @xmath4 structures in ml silicene on ag(111 ) . instead ,",
    "in the bl silicene on the ag(111 ) surface , we find the _ tristability _ among the three @xmath6 structures .",
    "the calculated transition barriers are in the range of 7 to 9 mev per si atom , inferring the possibility of the flip - flop motion at the low temperature .",
    "we also clarify that the vdw force is unimportant and the covalency plays a major role in the silicene - ag interaction .",
    "this renders the dirac states to be _ deep _ in the valence bands .",
    "the total - energy electronic - structure calculations have been performed in the density functional theory ( dft ) using vasp code.@xcite the exchange - correlation functional , vdw - df,@xcite being capable of treating the dispersion force is adopted.@xcite to elucidate the role of the dispersion force ( vdw force ) , we have also performed the calculations by the local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite and the generalized gradient approximation ( gga).@xcite the electron - ion interaction is described by the projector augmented wave method,@xcite and the cutoff energy of 250 ev in the plane - wave basis set is used .",
    "the ag surface is simulated by a repeating slab model consisting of a five - atomic - layer slab cleaved from the face - centered - cubic ( fcc ) ag with the experimental lattice constant ( 4.09  ) . the ag slab is separated from its images by the 14-(17- ) vacuum region with single - layer(double - layer ) si atoms placed on top to simulate the ml(bl ) silicene on the ag(111 ) surface .",
    "the geometry optimization is performed until the remaining forces become less than 0.02 ev /  .",
    "we have carefully examined the validity of the @xmath7-point mesh in brillouin zone ( bz ) integration , and found that the spacing between adjacent @xmath7-point being less than 0.016 @xmath8 is sufficient to obtain converged results ( the fine k - point mesh hereafter ) .",
    "we first consider the ml silicene with the periodicity of @xmath9 on @xmath10 ag(111 ) , which was reported to relax into two mirror - symmetric rhombic @xmath0 structures by chen _",

    "@xmath26 is the number of si atoms in a single layer of the silicene , and @xmath27 is the chemical potential of si which is adopted as the total energy of an isolated si atom .",

    ".    calculated cohesive energy for the stable @xmath0 silicene on ag(111 ) ( 5.387 ev / si ) is a bit smaller than that of the @xmath9 on ag(111 ) ( 5.391 ev / si ) .",
    "both of them are smaller than that of the most stable @xmath18 silicene on ag(111 ) ( 5.41 ev / si in our calculation),@xcite which has been widely observed in experiments,@xcite by about 20 mev / si .",
    "moreover , the binding energies for both the stable @xmath0 ( 0.63 ev / si ) and the @xmath9 ( 0.65 ev / si ) structures are larger than the typical vdw interaction energy manifested in the cases of graphene on metal surfaces,@xcite by an order of magnitude , showing the covalent - bonding interactions between silicene and ag surface .    in the @xmath9 and",

    "[ strsl](a ) and [ strsl](b ) , the vertical spacing between the lower si and the topmost ag atoms , @xmath14 , is 2.47 and 2.37  , respectively .",
    "considering that the atomic radii of si and ag are 1.18  and 1.65  , respectively , it is clear that the si - ag covalent bonds are formed .",
    "on the other hand , the vertical spacing between the protruded si atoms and the topmost ag atoms is around 3.5  .",
    "this explains why the protruded si atoms are located both on top and hollow sites of the ag substrate in figs .",
    "[ strsl](a ) and [ strsl](b ) .",
    "we have also performed the lda and gga calculations , and obtained the essentially identical results with the vdw - df calculations ( table .",

    "et al . _ , clarifying that the @xmath11-point sampling in the calculations is inadequate and leads to the incorrect results .",
    "from our results obtained for the ml silicene described in the previous section , we conclude that the honeycomb @xmath0 silicene structure observed in the experiment does not correspond to the ml silicene .",
    "a plausible possibility is then the bl silicene .",
    "actually several experiments@xcite suggest the existence of bilayer and even a few - layer silicenes on the ag(111 ) surface .",
    "we have then performed extensive search for the stable geometries of the bl silicene on ag(111 ) with various commensurations of the two periodicities of the silicene and ag(111 ) . we have eventually found that the ab stacking @xmath18 bl silicene on @xmath19 ag(111 ) is spontaneously relaxed into three @xmath0 silicene structures , which we call str1 , str2 and str3 hereafter , as shown in fig .",
    "[ strbl ] .",
    "since the stacking of the two atomic layers of the bl silicene is not identified experimentally , we have also considered the case of the aa stacking .",
    "our calculations show that the aa stacking bl silicene is not relaxed to the @xmath0 structure spontaneously .",
    "however , we have also found a stable aa stacking structure with the @xmath18 periodicity .",
    "this shows that both the aa and ab bilayer silicene exist .",
    "we expect the experiments can also observe @xmath18 aa stacking silicene on ag(111 ) in the future .",
    "a common structural characteristic of the three stable @xmath0 ab stacking structures is the protrusion of a single si atom in the upper layer by 1  from the remaining five si atoms in the lateral @xmath0 periodicity .",
    "this is similar to the @xmath0 structure of ml silicene in fig .",
    "[ strsl](b ) . in the lower - layer silicene ,",
    "si atoms are buckled with the amount of about 0.8  , as they are on the ( 111 ) plane of diamond - structured si .",
    "the lowest - energy structure is str3 .",
    "other structures , str1 and str2 , are higher in energy only by 0.06 mev and 0.36 mev , respectively , per si atom of the upper - layer silicene , showing the existence of all three structures in experiments .",
    "we have then identified the transition states among the three stable structures by the nudged elastic band ( neb ) method.@xcite the obtained energy barrier for each reaction coordinate is shown in fig . [",
    "both the barriers from str1 to str2 and from str2 to str3 are 7.12 mev / si , while it is a bit larger for the transition from str1 to str3 ( 8.88 mev / si ) . it is noteworthy that these barriers are lower by an order than the values reported by chen _",

    "1(e ) of ref . ] at low temperature ( below 40k ) , where the big bright spots correspond to the protrusions of str2 , whereas the small orange spots in the two different domains correspond to the protrusions of str1 and str3 , respectively .    with increasing the temperature",
    ", the flip - flop motion between the two of the three stable structures may take place . in the case",
    ", the stm image should be the superposition of the two rhombic images .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ neb](b ) shows such superposition of the two rhombic images , where the perfect honeycomb @xmath0 image is prominent .",
    "the honeycomb image obtained agrees with the experimental images at higher temperature by chen _",
    "et al_.@xcite our results indicate that the honeycomb @xmath0 silicene structure observed by the stm and identified as ml silicene is originated from the flip - flop motion of the rhombic @xmath0 structures in _ bilayer _ silicene on ag(111 ) .",
    "it should be mentioned that the transition barriers for the three rhombic structures are not large ( below 9 mev / si ) so that the flip - flop motion is expected to happen frequently among the three at room temperature . in the case , the stm image of the @xmath28 silicene structure , as calculated in the right panel of fig . [ neb](b ) , is also expected to be observed .",
    "yet it has not been reported so far .",
    "a common feature in the three @xmath0 bl silicene structures is that all the protruded si atoms in the upper - layer are located on the hollow sites of lower - layer silicene ( left parts of fig .",
    "[ strbl ] ) , which makes them weakly interacted with the si atoms in the lower - layer silicene . hence in contrast to the ml silicene case where the si - ag bond is reformed , the bond reformation is not required during the flip - flop motion among the three rhombic structures .",
    "this explains the substantially low energy barrier that we have obtained .",
    "the structural parameters and corresponding cohesive and binding energies for the @xmath0 bl silicene of str1 are shown in table [ structure1 ] .",
    "the cohesive energy ( 5.34 ev / si ) is comparable with that of ml silicene and much larger than that of freestanding silicene ( 4.75 ev / si in our calculation ) , showing the possibility of obtaining the @xmath0 bl silicene in experiments .",
    "the binding energy ( 0.78 ev / si ) between the bl silicene and ag surface is even larger than that of the ml silicene on ag(111 ) . here",
    "the binding energy is the energy gain in the deposition of bl silicene on ag(111 ) surface , which is defined as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the number of si atoms in the lower - layer silicene .",
    "this implies the covalent bonding interactions with the substrates .",
    "the spacing between the lower - layer silicene and ag surface ( 2.25  ) confirms the formation of si - ag bonds .",
    "the short silicene - silicene interlayer distance ( 2.58  ) also shows the formation of si - si bonds between layers .",
    "the results for other two @xmath0 bl silicene structures are nearly the same .",
    "we have also performed the lda and gga calculations and find that the results obtained through the different approximations are essentially identical ( table [ structure1 ] ) .",
    "we are now in a position to discuss the electronic structure .",
    "[ bdbl](a ) shows the calculated energy bands for the @xmath18 bl silicene/@xmath19 ag(111 ) , where the silicene presents the @xmath0 periodicity [ str1 , shown in fig .",
    "[ strbl](a ) ] . through the analyses of the kohn - sham ( ks ) orbitals , we have found no apparent energy band near @xmath5 that shows the linear energy dispersion peculiar to dirac @xmath31 and anti - bonding @xmath31 ( labeled as @xmath32 ) states .",
    "instead , we have found that the states with characters of @xmath31 and @xmath32 appear at 0.6 - 0.9 ev below @xmath5 [ fig .",

    "[ bdbl](c ) ] .",
    "this freestanding bl silicene has the identical structure with the bl silicene in str1 , except that the si atoms in the lower layer lose their partner ag atoms . even for this freestanding bl silicene ,",
    "the dirac @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) states which show the linear dispersion are absent . in this case",
    "the energy bands which have characters of @xmath31 and @xmath32 appear near @xmath5 , with a band gap of 0.1 ev .",
    "the corresponding ks orbitals of these states are shown in fig .",
    "[ bdbl](d ) , where obvious interlayer @xmath31-@xmath31 orbital mixing induced by the interlayer interactions as well as the intralayer @xmath31-@xmath33 orbital mixing induced by the buckling of silicene layers are observed .",
    "such mixing is the reason of the gap opening .",
    "the @xmath31 and @xmath32 states shift upward near @xmath5 from the deep position in the valence bands by peeling the bl silicene from the ag substrate .",
    "the amount of the charge transfer between the ag and the silicene is small , as is clarified in other stable silicene structures on the ag(111).@xcite hence it is now evident that the hybridization between the si orbitals on the lower - layer silicene and the ag orbitals on the substrate makes the @xmath31 and @xmath32 states deep in the valence bands and that cutting the bonds makes those states shift upward near @xmath5 .",
    "this feature is common to all the silicene on the ag(111 ) surfaces so far available.@xcite    finally , we come to discuss the linear - like energy dispersion derived from the quasi - particle interference patterns in the experiments.@xcite the fermi velocity obtained from the linear - like energy dispersion [ around @xmath34 @xcite is two times larger than that of freestanding ml silicene ( around @xmath35)@xcite , suggesting that the experimental observation does not correspond to the dirac states of silicene . through the detailed analysis of ks orbitals for all the energy bands along the @xmath11-k direction in bz ,",

    "the energy band mainly consists of the @xmath37 and @xmath38 orbitals of ag atoms located at subsurface atomic layers .",
    "this strongly indicates that the linear energy dispersion reported in the experiments corresponds to the @xmath39 band of ag substrate .",
    "we have performed the density - functional calculations for both monolayer and bilayer silicene on ag(111 ) surfaces .",
