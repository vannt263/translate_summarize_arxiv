    "lie - algebraic and lie group theoretic methods have played a significant role in finding exact solutions to the schrdinger equation in quantum mechanics . in the classical applications",
    ", the lie group appears as a symmetry group of the hamiltonian operator , and the associated representation theory provides an algebraic means for computing the spectrum .",
    "of particular importance are the exactly solvable problems , such as the harmonic oscillator or the hydrogen atom , whose point spectrum can be completely determined using purely algebraic methods . the concept of a _",
    "spectrum generating algebra _ dates back to a paper by goshen and lipkin @xcite , and was later rediscovered in the context of high energy physics by two different groups @xcite .",
    "the study of spectrum generating algebras received much impetus in the subsequent years ( see the review @xcite ) and it was soon applied also in the field of molecular dynamics by iachello , levine , alhassid , grsey and their collaborators ( see the book @xcite for a survey of theory and applications ) .",
    "most of the applications of spectrum generating algebras concerned _ exactly solvable _",
    "hamiltonians whose spectrum could be completely determined by algebraic means . an intermediate class of spectral problems",
    "are those for which only a finite part of the point spectrum can be calculated by algebraic methods , but possibly not the whole spectrum .",
    "the usual example of these type of problems is the sextic oscillator in which the potential is an even polynomial of degree six whose coefficients depend on a parameter @xmath1 . for each positive integer value of @xmath1",
    "the hamiltonian is shown to preserve an @xmath2-dimensional subspace of @xmath3 .",
    "it is clear from sturm - liouville theory that the hamiltonian with the sextic potential has an infinite number of bound states , but only @xmath4 of them belong to the so called _ algebraic _ sector .",
    "it was soon realized that the sextic oscillator was just the first example of a large class of systems having this property , and the works of shifman , turbiner , ushveridze @xcite and their collaborators initiated the study of the mathematical properties and physical applications of this new class of spectral problems , which they named _ quasi - exactly solvable_. however , even in the simplest case of one spatial dimension , there is no way to ascertain whether a given potential is quasi - exactly solvable or not , so two methods were proposed to construct large families of quasi - exactly solvable problems : the lie - algebraic method @xcite and the analytic method @xcite .",
    "the idea underlying the lie - algebraic method is to use results from the representation theory of lie algebras to ensure that a given hamiltonian preserves a certain finite dimensional subspace of functions . in one dimension ,",
    "the only algebra of first order differential operators with finite dimensional is @xmath0 , whose generators : @xmath5 preserve the @xmath2-dimensional linear space of polynomials in the @xmath6 variable of degree less than or equal to @xmath1 : @xmath7 the most general second order differential operator that preserves @xmath8 can be written as a quadratic combination of the generators ( [ eq : sl2generators ] ) of @xmath0 @xmath9 where the indexes run over the values @xmath10 .",
    "the operator @xmath11 is said to be _ lie algebraic _ and @xmath0 is often referred to as a hidden symmetry algebra .",
    "the operator @xmath11 does not have in general the form of a schrdinger operator , but it can be transformed into a schrdinger operator by a change of variables and a conjugation by a non - vanishing function .",
    "such a transformation always exists in one spatial dimension , but in more dimensions the equivalence problem remains open @xcite .",
    "this has been a long standing obstacle to classify multidimensional quasi - exactly solvable hamiltonians , where only a few families are known @xcite .",
    "one important fact lies at the core of the lie - algebraic method : it is ensured by burnside s classical theorem that every differential operator which leaves the space @xmath12 invariant belongs to the enveloping algebra @xmath13 , since @xmath14 is an irreducible module for the @xmath0 action .",
    "this is probably the reason for the relative success of the lie - algebraic constructions in the context of quasi - exact solvability , up to the point that the terms _ lie - algebraic _ and _ quasi - exactly solvable _ are often used as synonims in the literature .",
    "however , there are many other finite dimensional polynomial spaces which are not irreducible modules for the @xmath0 action , and in these cases there might be non - lie algebraic differential operators which leave the space invariant .",
    "the first exploration of this type was done by post and turbiner @xcite , who classified all second order differential operators which preserve a polynomial space generated by monomials . in their work",
    "they did not use lie algebras but other considerations based on the grading of the operators and basis elements .",
    "it was later realized that these differential operators can also be transformed into schrdinger form thereby providing new examples of quasi - exactly solvable operators which are not lie algebraic . in this",
    "_ direct approach _ to quasi - exact solvability @xcite more general polynomial spaces are considered and the set of differential operators that preserve them are investigated without any reference to lie algebras .",
    "it was later shown that exactly solvable potentials exist which are not lie algebraic , but can be obtained from a lie algebraic potentials via a state - adding darboux transformation @xcite .",
    "further research along this line suggests to regard a darboux or susy transformation not just as a transformation on the potential and eigenfunctions , but as an algebraic deformation of an infinite polynomial flag @xcite .",
    "non lie - algebraic potentials appear also in the recent work of gonzlez - lpez and tanaka in the context of supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "in contrast with the lie algebraic method , the analytic method has received less attention over the last decades .",
    "however recent results suggest that it is a more suitable approach to encompass this new type of quasi - exactly solvable systems which do not fit in the lie algebraic scheme,@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we would like to illustrate the relevance of studying quasi - exact solvability beyond the lie algebraic approach by providing two suitably chosen examples : in section [ sec : more ] we show how more energy levels can be obtained from a lie algebraic potential which can not be obtained in the @xmath0 approach . in section [ sec : nolie ] we show an example of a potential which is quasi - exactly solvable but not lie algebraic .",
    "in this section we expose the first reason to study quasi - exactly solvable problems beyond the lie - algebraic approach .",
    "we present a potential which is known to admit an @xmath0 algebraization , and therefore allows for some of its energy levels to be calculated algebraically , all belonging to the even sector . for this same potential , we show that a different algebraization exists in which the algebraic hamiltonian can not be expressed as an element of the enveloping algebra of @xmath0 . this new algebraization allows to calculate all the previous levels , plus some extra ones .",
    "consider the following schrdinger operator @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a real parameter and where @xmath1 is a positive integer .",
    "this potential is known to be lie - algebraic and it appears for instance in the classification performed by gonzlez - lpez , kamran and olver in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 algebraization of this potential is achieved by the transformation @xmath17 with the following choice of gauge factor and change of coordinate @xmath18 up to an additive constant , the transformed operator @xmath19 becomes @xmath20 which is easily seen to preserve the space @xmath8 defined in ( [ pnz ] ) .",
    "the explicit quadratic combination of @xmath19 in terms of @xmath0 generators is ( again up to an additive constant ) @xmath21 as a consequence of this @xmath0 algebraization we can calculate @xmath22 energy levels of the hamiltonian , by diagonalizing the corresponding matrix of the restricted action of @xmath19 to @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath2 algebraic eigenfunctions have the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 is one of the @xmath2 polynomial eigenfunctions that @xmath19 is ensured to have .",
    "all the eigenfunctions obtained via the lie algebraic method correspond to the even sector .    up to this point , all these results are well known .",
    "however , the _ same _ hamiltonian remarkably admits a _ different _",
    "algebraization characterized by the following gauge factor and change of variables : @xmath26 the transformed operator @xmath27 becomes @xmath28 where an additive constant has been dropped .",
    "it is straightforward to realise that due to the rational coefficients in the previous expression , the operator @xmath29 does not belong to the enveloping algebra of @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless it preserves a @xmath30-dimensional subspace generated by polynomials in the variable @xmath31 that we shall denote as @xmath32 and define as @xmath33 this polynomial subspace is an example of an _ exceptional polynomial module _ ,",
    "the name exceptional being due to the fact that the space of second order operators that leave it invariant have a rich structure @xcite .",
    "an explicit basis of @xmath32 can be given in the following manner @xmath34 this second algebraization allows us to compute @xmath30 algebraic eigenfunctions of the schrdinger operator ( [ eq : sch ] ) , which will be of the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 is one of the @xmath30 polynomial eigenfunctions that @xmath29 is ensured to have .",
    "we observe that these eigenfunctions can be both odd and even , as opposed to the @xmath0 algebraic ones , which were only even .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath4 algebraic eigenfunctions via the @xmath0 algebraization and @xmath30 algebraic eigenfunctions via the exceptional module algebraization .",
    "the situation is depicted schematically in figure [ fig0 ] .",
    "c    it is maybe worth to explore the relation between the two different algebraizations .",
    "it is known in the theory of lie algebraic problems that under linear fractional transformations the lie - algebraic character is preserved @xcite .",
    "more specifically , a change of variable by a linear fractional transformation , @xmath37 together with an appropriate gauge transformation preserve the space @xmath23 since @xmath38 moreover , if @xmath19 is lie - algebraic and preserves @xmath12 , then @xmath39 is also lie - algebraic and preserves @xmath40 .",
    "we see thus that projective transformations do not change the @xmath0 character , in fact they amount to a linear transformation of the generators of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "however , from expressions ( [ mu1]),([change1]),([mu2 ] ) and ( [ change2 ] ) it follows that the relation between the two algebraic operators @xmath19 and @xmath29 in the previous example is given by @xmath41 which is not a projective transformation .",
    "we have performed an explicit computation to show a few of the algebraic eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : sch ] ) .",
    "for illustrative purposes it suffices to fix the integer parameter @xmath1 to some low value .",
    "for the values @xmath42 and @xmath43 the potential ( [ eq : sch ] ) has the shape of a double - well potential shown in figure [ fig1 ] .      for @xmath42 the operator @xmath19 in ( [ eq :",
    "t ] ) satisfies @xmath44 which allows to compute four algebraic eigenfunctions via the @xmath0 algebraization .",
    "the action of @xmath19 relative to the canonical basis of @xmath45 is given by the following @xmath46 matrix : @xmath47 0.1 cm for @xmath43 we have calculated four algebraic eigenfunctions of ( [ eq : sch ] ) which have the form @xmath48 where @xmath49 is one of the four eigen - polynomials of @xmath19 and the gauge factor @xmath50 is given by ( [ mu1 ] ) .",
    "these four eigenfunctions have been plotted in figure [ fig1 ] along with their corresponding energies , which have been normalized so that the energy of the ground state is zero .      from the second algebraization we know that the schrdinger operator @xmath51 is conjugate via the change of variables ( [ change2 ] ) and gauge factor ( [ mu2 ] ) to the operator @xmath52 which preserves an exceptional polynomial module .",
    "for @xmath42 this space is spanned by @xmath53 and the matrix of the action of @xmath29 relative to this basis is 0.1 cm @xmath54 0.1 cm for the same value @xmath43 we have calculated six algebraic eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : sch ] ) which have the form @xmath55 where @xmath56 is one of the six eigen - polynomials of @xmath29 and the gauge factor @xmath57 is given by ( [ mu2 ] ) .",
    "these six algebraic eigenfunctions along with their energies are shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the first thing to note is that we obtain all the even eigenfunctions from the @xmath0 algebraization plus two extra odd eigenfunctions corresponding to the first and third excited states .",
    "however , the eigenfunction corresponding to the fifth excited state is not present in the algebraic sector . for arbitrary @xmath1",
    "it seems that there is always a gap in the algebraic sector just below the highest energy in the exceptional module algebraization , @xcite .",
    "although all evidences show that this is true in the general case , there is yet no proof of this result .",
    "in the previous section we have seen how the exceptional module algebraization can provide more energy levels from a lie - algebraic potential . in this section",
    "we will show that some schrdinger operators only admit an exceptional module algebraization and not the traditional @xmath0 one .",
    "we can therefore construct new quasi - exactly solvable potentials on the line , which are not in the classifications of qes potentials in @xcite , since those classifications deal only with potentials that admit an @xmath0 algebraization . in this section",
    "we show one first simple example of this phenomenon , postponing the full classification of these new potentials to a future publication,@xcite .",
    "consider the following schrdinger operator : @xmath58 with potential @xmath59a\\big ) x^2 + 4 \\frac{x^2 - 1}{(x^2 + 1)^2}.\\ ] ] if the last rational term were absent , this potential would be the well known quasi - exactly solvable sextic potential discussed for instance in @xcite .",
    "the potential is always even , so its eigenfunctions will have well defined parity .",
    "however , as it happens with the sextic , only even or odd eigenfunctions but not both appear in the algebraic sector . this does not exclude in principle that other algebraizations exist in which both even and odd eigenfunctions are obtained .",
    "in fact , the choice of @xmath60 gives a potential with algebraic even eigenfunctions while @xmath61 corresponds to potentials with odd algebraic eigenfunctions .",
    "for arbitrary values of @xmath62 and @xmath63 the hamiltonian does not preserve any finite dimensional subspace , but for the following values : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is an arbitrary real parameter , the hamiltonian @xmath51 admits an exceptional module algebraization .",
    "more specificallly , the transformation @xmath66 with @xmath67 transforms @xmath51 into the algebraic operator @xmath19 given by @xmath68 up to an additive constant .",
    "the operators @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are given by @xmath72 and every one of them leaves invariant the exceptional module @xmath73 given by @xmath74 the sextic potential ( [ eq : sextic ] ) has eigenfunctions in @xmath3 provided that @xmath16 , or @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "this last case corresponds in fact to an exactly solvable potential , which can be obtained by a susy transformation from the harmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "the algebraic operator preserves in this last case an infinite flag of exceptional polynomial subspaces .    we show some explicit eigenfunctions of this potential corresponding to the even sector by setting @xmath77 and @xmath60 .",
    "the matrix of the action of @xmath19 with respect to the basis ( [ eq : basis ] ) of @xmath78 is    @xmath79    for @xmath80 the four polynomial eigenfunctions of @xmath19 are approximately @xmath81where polynomial @xmath25 has @xmath82 zeros .",
    "the corresponding energies are : @xmath83 therefore the four even eigenfunctions of ( [ eq : sextic ] ) coming from the exceptional module algebraization are : @xmath84 where the gauge factor @xmath50 is given by ( [ musextic ] ) with @xmath60 . for this choice of parameters @xmath65 , @xmath85 and @xmath1 the potential , gauge factor and eigenfunctions have been plotted in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "we observe once again that we obtain eigenfunctions with zero , two , four and eight zeros , but not one with six zeros . for arbitrary @xmath1 the eigenfunction with @xmath86 zeros would be missing form the algebraic sector .",
    "the calculations for the odd case are similar : setting @xmath61 in ( [ eq : sextic ] ) we have calculated @xmath77 odd eigenfunctions which are shown in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "by means of two examples we provide further arguments to motivate the study of quasi - exactly solvable problems beyond the lie algebraic approach . even in the simplest case of one dimensional quantum mechanical problems the classifications performed in @xcite",
    "do not cover all quasi - exactly solvable potentials .",
    "since lie algebraic potentials are only a subclass of the potentials with partial algebraization of their spectrum , it would be desirable to find a precise mathematical characterization of the latter .",
    "this problem is related to the so called _ generalized bochner problem _ @xcite , that of finding the most general differential operator that preserves a general finite dimensional space of polynomials .",
    "all the new quasi - exactly solvable potentials obtained recently are based on the exceptional modules , but other polynomial subspaces might exist which do not have a monomial basis and yet have a rich structure . in conclusion , the class of hamiltonians with partial algebraization of their spectrum is larger than it was previously thought , and the new results call for new theoretical developments on this field .",
