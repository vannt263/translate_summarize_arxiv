    "the imaging comptel experiment aboard cgro is the pioneering satellite experiment of the mev - sky ( @xmath01 - 30  mev ) . for a detailed description of comptel see @xcite .",
    "one of comptel s prime goals is the generation of all - sky maps , which provide a summary on the mev - sky in total .",
    "this goal has been achieved by e.g. @xcite , @xcite who generated maximum - entropy all - sky images and by @xcite , who generated the first comptel all - sky maximum - likelihood maps , which  compared to maximum - entropy ones  have the advantage of providing quantitative results like significances and fluxes of source features . here",
    "we present all - sky maximum - likelihood maps from which models of the diffuse emission have been removed .",
    "our emphasis is on agn . for a discussion on the method see @xcite in these proceedings .",
    "the main analysis goals are 1 ) to derive a summary of known comptel point sources , 2 ) to search for further point sources , 3 ) to derive time - averaged quantitative parameters ( first order ) of our brightest point sources , i.e. , significances , fluxes , mev - spectra , and possible time variability , and 4 ) to further investigate our data and analysis methods .",
    "using all data from the beginning of the cgro mission ( april 91 ) to the end of cgro cycle vi ( nov .",
    "97 ) , we generated a consistent database of relevant comptel data sets ( events , exposure , geometry ) for individual cgro viewing periods ( vps ) in the 4 standard energy bands ( 0.75 - 1 , 1 - 3 , 3 - 10 , 10 - 30  mev ) in galactic coordinates by applying consistent data selections .",
    "this database was supplemented by relevant data sets containing models describing the galactic diffuse  emission ( hi , co , and inverse - compton components ) and the isotropic extragalactic  background emission . to check for time variability of  sources",
    "these data sets were combined for different time periods : the six individual cgro phases / cycles , the sum of all data ( cgro phases i - vi ; april 91 - nov .",
    "97 ) as well as the first ( cgro phases i - iii ; april 91 - oct .",
    "94 ) and the second half ( cgro phases iv - vi ; oct .",
    "94 - nov .",
    "each set of all - sky data is analysed by our standard maximum - likelihood method which simultaneously handles individual vps , generates , iteratively , a background model ( see @xcite ) , and finally generates significance and flux maps and/or significances and fluxes for individual sources . because we are interested in point sources ,",
    "the diffuse emission is always removed in the fitting procedure ( e.g. figure  [ fig1 ] ) . for the derivation of the source fluxes ( see figure  [ fig2 ] as an example ) , the point sources of interest ( e.g. 3c  273 , cyg  x-1 ) have additionally been included in the fitting procedure .",
    "we like to mention however , that the results derived by such all - sky fits should be considered correct to first order only . to derive final / optimal results for a particular source",
    ", a dedicated analysis has to be carried out , which e.g. makes several cross checks by applying different background models and would take into account the presence of other source features in the region of interest .",
    "also , along the galactic plane the results depend on the goodness of the applied diffuse emission models for the mev - band .",
    "the significance maps in figure  [ fig1 ] , which contain all data of the first 6.5 years of the comptel mission , are the first comptel all - sky point source maps in the continuum bands .",
    "they provide a summary of the on - average brightest and most significant mev - sources .",
    "similar maps focussing on the galactic plane only are given elsewhere in these proceedings ( [ 5 ] ) .",
    "the crab  for display reasons removed in all maps of figure  [ fig1 ]  is by far the most significant comptel point source . in the 1 - 3  mev band for example it reaches a significance of @xmath0110  ( i.e. a likelihood ratio of @xmath012000 ) for the cgro phase i - vi period . with significances of @xmath011 , @xmath010 , and @xmath06   in the 1 - 3",
    ", 3 - 10 , and 10 - 30  mev bands is the quasar 3c  273 found to be on average the second most significant point source .",
    "its fluxes in these bands are between 10% and 15% of the crab flux .",
    "several other extragalactic ( e.g. 3c  279 , pks  0528 + 134 , cen  a ) and galactic ( e.g. cyg  x-1 , psr 1509 - 58 , a known but unidentified source at l;b :  18;0 ) sources are visible as well .",
    "in addition there are indications for previously unknown source features like at l;b :  75;+65  in the 1 - 3  mev map and at l;b :  85;-65   in the 3 - 10  mev map for example .",
    "such spots are promising candidates for further dedicated analyses .",
    "this time - averaged approach suppresses sources which flare up only in short time periods .",
    "therefore the maps show fewer sources than are listed in the comptel source catalog ( see @xcite ) .",
    ".detection significances ( ) in 3 different energy bands of some known comptel agn sources ( plus crab ) as derived by this all - sky analysis for the sum of data of the first 6.5 years of the comptel mission .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for all bright and significant comptel sources we have derived fluxes in our 4 standard energy bands for the different time periods mentioned above , and have combined them to mev light curves and spectra . some results for 3c  273",
    "are shown as an example in figure  [ fig2 ] . in the 1 - 10  mev energy band 3c  273",
    "is detected in each cgro phase / cycle i.e. in time periods of typically 1  year .",
    "the flux turns out to be rather stable and varies only within a factor of @xmath02 in the 1 - 3  mev and within a factor of @xmath04 in the 3 - 10  mev energy band .",
    "the spectra show the same trend . whereas the flux below 3  mev turns out to be same for both halves ,",
    "there is an indication that at the upper comptel energies ( @xmath13  mev ) the source was brighter during the second half .",
    "all three spectra clearly show the spectral turnover occuring at mev - energies .",
    "however , we emphasize that for final conclusions a dedicated source analysis has to be carried out .",
    "we have applied the maximum - likelihood method to comptel all - sky data of different time periods . by simultaneously fitting models for the different diffuse emission components ,",
    "this analysis method provided quantitative all - sky results  significances and fluxes  on point sources . an all - sky summary on their time - averaged fluxes and significances",
    "is thereby provided .",
    "after the crab  pulsar plus nebula  the quasar 3c  273 was found to be the most significant comptel mev - source , having time - averaged fluxes of the order of 10% to 15% of the crab .",
    "additional evidence for previously unknown source features has been found as well .",
