    ", the @xmath20 invariant mass distribution is not able to resolve the two hypotheses despite of the high statistics , and the way the fit was performed leads to the dilution of the sensitivity of the @xmath17 channel .    to improve the analysis of all available data sensitive to the spin of the @xmath6 @xmath21  we write the decay matrix elements for both the @xmath7 and @xmath8 hypotheses as given by enforcing lorentz invariance and parity considerations ,",
    "@xmath22  we give a functional dependency on the decay momenta to the couplings introducing a length scale @xmath23  which is to be related to the finite size of the hadrons participating to the interactions , @xmath24  we use the matrix elements of @xmath25 and @xmath26 decays to take into account the appropriate decay waves ; we do not pursue the blatt - weisskopf description as we find that all spin structure can appropriately be taken into account with no further approximations , @xmath27  we perform a global fit to exploit the information contained in all the distributions available and we adopt a statistical approach appropriate when distributions with different sensitivities to the parameters of interest are combined .",

    "the coupling @xmath40 is real whereas the couplings @xmath41 and @xmath42 are separately real but can have a complex relative phase .",

    "<S> whether the much studied @xmath0 is an axial or tensor resonance makes an important difference to its interpretation . </S>",
    "<S> a recent paper by the babar collaboration  @xcite raised the viable hypothesis that it might be a @xmath1 state based on the @xmath2 spectrum in the @xmath3 decays . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the belle collaboration published the @xmath4 invariant mass and spin - sensitive angular distributions in @xmath5 decays  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> starting from a general parametrization of the decay amplitudes for the axial and tensor quantum numbers of the @xmath6 , we re - analyze the whole set of available data . </S>",
    "<S> the level of agreement of the two spin hypotheses with data is interpreted with a rigorous statistical approach based on monte carlo simulations in order to be able to combine all the distributions regardless of their different levels of sensitivity to the spin of the @xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> our analysis returns a probability of 5.5% and 0.1% for the agreement with data of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 hypotheses , respectively , once we combine the whole information ( angular and mass distributions ) from both channels . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the separate analysis of @xmath9 ( angular and mass distributions ) and @xmath10 ( mass distribution ) indicates that the @xmath8 assignment is excluded at the 99.9% c.l . by the former case , while the latter excludes at the same level the @xmath7 hypothesis . </S>",
    "<S> there are therefore indications that the two decay modes behave in a different way . </S>",
