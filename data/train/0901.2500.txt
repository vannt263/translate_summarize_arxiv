    "investigation of hadron production in ultra - relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions has revealed convincing evidence for a thermal production mechanism . in particular , the study of yields of hadrons composed of light ( u , d , s ) valence quarks from ags up to rhic energies has shown @xcite that hadron multiplicities can be described quantitatively in the framework of a hadro - chemical equilibrium approach . within this model",
    "the only parameters are thermal quantities : the chemical freeze - out temperature @xmath0 , the chemical potentials @xmath1 and , if applicable , the fireball volume @xmath2 ; for a recent review see @xcite .",
    "the underlying picture of the evolution of the system formed in a collision between two heavy nuclei at high energies is the following : in the early phase of the collision partons are liberated in hard collisions describable by perturbative quantum chromo dynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "the partonic system subsequently equilibrates , i.e. reaches ( approximate ) local momentum isotropy , all the while expanding in beam direction with velocity of light .",
    "this system is called the fireball and is characterized by thermal parameters such as a temperature and by an equation of state .",
    "eventually also transverse expansion builds up .",
    "the expanding fireball cools with its temperature dropping as t @xmath3 ( or slightly faster due to transverse expansion ) .",
    "eventually the fireball reaches the phase boundary between quarkmatter and hadronic matter and the partonic degrees of freedom are converted into hadronic degrees of freedom .",
    "the corresponding reduction in degrees of freedom is more than a factor of 3 and therefore the volume has to grow accordingly during hadronization . at some temperature equal or below the critical temperature hadron yields",
    "are frozen in .",
    "this is what is called the chemical freeze - out and the corresponding thermal parameters t and @xmath1 are determined from the analysis of hadron yields as discussed in the previous paragraph .",
    "the now hadronic fireball may expand and cool further until elastic collisions seize to change the momentum distributions .",
    "this point is called thermal freeze - out . after this point there",
    "may still be some residual interactions ( e.g. coulomb interaction ) and weak decays .",
    "the resulting momenta and particle types are measured in the detectors .",
    "an important outcome of the hadron yield investigations is that the extracted temperature values rise sharply with energy for energies in the c.m .",
    "system per colliding nucleon pair @xmath4 below 10 gev and reach constant values near @xmath0=160 mev ; this appears to be the limiting temperature for a hadronic fireball .",
    "the baryo - chemical potential exhibits a strong ( monotonous ) decrease as a function of energy .",
    "even detailed features such as the , up to very recently considered rather mysterious , sharp maximum in the excitation function of the @xmath5 ratio at sps energies ( `` the horn '' ) can be described quantitatively if full account is taken of the hadronic mass spectrum @xcite .",
    "the limiting temperature implies a connection to the qcd phase boundary and it was , indeed , argued @xcite that the quark - hadron phase transition drives the equilibration dynamically , at least for sps energies and above .    the success in describing the production of hadrons containing light quarks in a thermal framework raises the question whether hadrons containing charm ( or even bottom ) quarks could also be produced thermally .",
    "the answer at first glance is no : the charm quarm mass @xmath6 gev brings in a new scale which exceeds significantly any conceivable temperature which may be reached in nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "it also is much larger than @xmath7 , implying that charm production should be describable in a perturbative qcd framework .",
    "thermal production of charm quarks is thus at best ( at lhc energy ) a small perturbation compared to production in hard scattering , and at presently available ( rhic and sps ) energies completely negligible .",
    "it is thus not surprizing that hadrons containing charm quarks , and in particular charmonia were considered key probes to diagnose the fireballs formed in ultra - relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "charmonia are bound states of charm quarks and their antiquarks . in nuclear collisions at high energy ,",
    "charm quarks can be produced rather copiously , leading in turn to significant cross sections for charmonium production .",
    "the typical radii of charmonium mesons are of order 0.2 - 0.5 fm , i.e. comparable to or larger than the mean distance between partons in a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) of temperature of a few hundred mev . because of this fact , charmonium production is considered an important probe to determine the degree of deconfinement reached in the fireball produced in ultra - relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "in fact , matsui and satz argued in @xcite that the expected high density of gluons in a qgp formed by collisions between heavy nuclei at ultra - relativistic energy should destroy any charmonia formed prior to the qgp in a process analoguous to debye screening in an electromagnetic plasma .",
    "consequently , suppression of charmonia ( compared to their production in the absence of qgp ) was proposed as a `` smoking gun '' signature for plasma formation in nuclear collisions at high energy .",
    "measurements at the cern sps accelerator indeed provided evidence for such suppression @xcite in central collisions between heavy nuclei , while no suppression was found in more grazing collisions or collisions between light nuclei , where plasma formation is not expected .",
    "however , absorption of charmonium in the nuclear medium as well as its break - up by hadrons produced in the collision were also identified as possible mechanisms leading to charmonium suppression even in the absence of qgp formation @xcite , and the interpretation of the sps data remains inconclusive .",
    "recent measurements performed at the rhic accelerator yielded a @xmath8 suppression similar to that observed at the sps , leading to further puzzles . for",
    "a recent review see @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was noted in @xcite that charmonium and , in particular , j/@xmath9 production in pb - pb collisions at sps energy exhibit thermal features .",
    "considering these and the general success of the thermal model in describing hadron production , but keeping in mind the new scale brought into the problem by the charm quark mass , led us to propose , in 2000 , the statistical hadronization model @xcite . in this approach , the number of charm quarks plus their antiparticles is effectively decoupled from the thermal description of charm quark hadronization at the qcd phase boundary , where hadrons are formed from charm quarks with statistical weights calculated at chemical freeze - out .",
    "in @xcite we have assumed that all charm quarks are formed in initial hard collisions but other processes such as thermal production in extremely hot fireballs formed at lhc energy @xcite could be considered in addition . apart from the total number of charm quarks , the only parameters entering the statistical hadronization model are the thermal parameters which are very well constrained by chemical freeze - out analyses .",
    "the idea of statistical hadronization led to a series of investigations of @xmath8 production based on this approach @xcite .",
    "initial interest focussed on the available sps data for @xmath8 production in pb - pb collisions , but the trends for rhic and lhc were also investigated @xcite .",
    "we note that a different approach , based on a kinetic model @xcite has been developed . here ,",
    "charmonia are continously formed ( and destroyed ) during the plasma phase and dynamical input , such as j/@xmath9 production cross sections , is needed to make predictions .",
    "recently the statistical hadronization model was extended to the production of @xmath10 mesons @xcite and multiply heavy - flavored hadrons @xcite .",
    "very comprehensive reviews of quarkonium production in heavy ion collisions can be found in @xcite .    a key feature of the statistical hadronization model as well as of the kinetic model is the fact that yields for the production of charmonia scale , because the charmonia are combined from charm and anti - charm quarks , with the square of the number of charm quarks @xmath11 in the system .",
    "this implies that , for sufficiently large @xmath11 , the production of charmonia should be enhanced @xcite rather than suppressed in a fully deconfined qgp .",
    "an important aspect of charmonium production and its possible modification in nuclear collisions is the sequence of time steps and scales involved in the process . in the original proposal @xcite charmonium ( or ,",
    "at least , its precursors , such as a color - octet c@xmath12 state ) is produced early , before quark - gluon plasma formation and also in a time interval which is short compared to the collision time .",
    "conversely , in the statistical hadronization model , charmonia and all charmed hadrons are formed late , at the time of hadronization of the qgp . in view of these wildely different approaches",
    "a thorough review of the relevant time scales was performed recently @xcite and will be important input for the understanding of charmonium as a probe for deconfinement in ultra - relativistic nucleus - nucleus collision .",
    "we start this review with a brief reminder , in section 2 , of the current status of the thermal model for hadron production .",
    "an account of the statistical hadronization model for charmonia and charmed hadrons is given in section 3 . in this section",
    "we will also discuss the various time scales relevant for charm , charmonium , and open charm hadron production and discuss their relevance for the applicability of the statistical hadronization model as well as for the study of possible medium effects in the charm sector .",
    "section 4 will deal with the current status of charmonium production in nucleus - nucleus collisions at sps and rhic energies and its interpretation in terms of the statistical hadronization model .",
    "our results on open charm and charmonium production and their sensitivities to possible in - medium modifications , in particular at energies below top sps energy , will be presented in section 5 .",
    "section 6 will be devoted to predictions for lhc energy .",
    "hadron production and in particular hadron yields have been studied with high precision in central nuclear collisions at ags , sps , and rhic energies .",
    "these yields can be described by assuming that all hadrons are formed when the fireball reaches a certain temperature t , chemical potential @xmath13 , and volume . under these conditions",
    "the yields can simply be described by the thermodynamical grand canonical ( or in special cases canonical ) ensemble .",
    "the underlying process is called `` chemical equilibration '' in analogy to particle production in the early universe .",
    "recent detailed analyses have been performed by @xcite , a comprehensive review can be found in @xcite .",
    "importantly , the data at sps and rhic energies comprise yields of multi - strange hadrons including the @xmath14 and @xmath15 baryons .",
    "their yields agree very well with the chemical equilibrium calculation and are strongly enhanced as compared to observations in pp collisions .",
    "this implies that , at chemical freeze - out , the strangeness sector is in equilibrium as well .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > \" , ]     this is shown in fig.[aa_fig2 ] . in the left panel",
    "the centrality dependence of @xmath16 at lhc energy is calculated using charm cross sections predicted in @xcite , while the comparison to charmonium data from rhic is done using the cross section computed for pp collisions by @xcite and scaled with the number of hard collisions ( see section 4.2 ) .",
    "the dramatic difference between rhic results and lhc predictions is obvious .",
    "we note , however , that the degree of charmonium suppression or enhancement in pbpb collisions at lhc energy depends strongly on the open charm cross section .",
    "this is demonstrated in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ aa_fig2 ] , where we show the centrality dependence of @xmath8 production for a reasonable range in the number of initially produced @xmath17 pairs . ] . over this range of charm cross section",
    "the yield of charmonia could vary by more than a factor of 10 and it is clear from this figure that a reasonably precise measurement of the open charm cross section in pbpb collisions is required to settle quantitatively the issue of statistical hadronization .",
    "the observation of an increase with @xmath18 of the charmonium yield will , however , be already a strong indication that charmonium production through combination of charm and anticharm quarks at the phase boundary is observed . this would be a spectacular fingerprint of deconfined and thermalized charm quarks in the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "we have reviewed the physical basis for a description of charmonium production in ultra - relativistic nuclear collisions within the framework of the statistical hadronization model .",
    "starting from an analysis of thermal production of hadrons composed of light ( u , d , s ) quarks we have presented the by now convincing evidence that these hadrons are formed ( nearly ) simultaneously at the qcd phase boundary by a process called `` chemical freeze - out '' with hadronic abundances quantitatively described by an equilibrated statistical ensemble . in other words , hadronization of light quarks takes place during the phase transition from the quark - gluon plasma to hadronic matter .",
    "heavy quarks , such as charm and bottom quarks , are not produced in the thermal fireballs formed in nucleus - nucleus collisions at high energy , but result dominantly from initial , hard collisions .",
    "owing to their large mass which exceeds the qcd phase transition temperature by more than a factor of 5 for charm quarks and 20 for bottom quarks , chemical equilibrium is never attained for heavy quarks",
    ". however , there is by now mounting evidence from studies of charm quark flow and energy loss , that thermal equilibrium is reached in the charm quark sector .",
    "this also implies that charm quarks can travel significant distances to combine with uncorrelated anti - charm quarks . experimental confirmation of predictions from the statistical hadronization model",
    "would then also imply direct information on the degree of deconfinement reached in the fireball .",
    "an interesting and completely open question is whether thermal equilibrium is also reached for bottom quarks .",
    "measurements at the lhc of possible flow and energy loss of identified bottom quarks will be crucial to shed more light on this issue .    we have described the development of the statistical hadronization model for heavy quarks and its application to charmonium production . in this model , all charm quarks are produced non - thermally but , in close analogy to the situation in the light quark sector , hadronize at the qcd phase boundary .",
    "open and hidden charm hadrons are then formed with relative abundances again determined by statistical weight factors which can be computed again using a statistical ensemble as for the light quarks .",
    "we note that hadronization of heavy quarks at temperatures higher than the qcd critical temperature is not compatible with this view .",
    "analyses of data on charmonium production at sps and rhic energies are in good agreement with predictions from the statistical hadronization model .",
    "further , more detailed tests at rhic energy and , in particular , analysis of data at lhc energy are essential to identify uniquely the underlying physics .    using the charm sector to search for possible medium effects , i.e. mass modifications of charmed hadrons in the hot fireball ,",
    "is severely constrained by charm conservation .",
    "this implies , e.g. , that cross sections for d - meson production are very insensitive to the actual mass of d - mesons since medium modifications will modify the distribution of charm quarks among the different hadron species while the initial charm production process is governed by the mass of the charm quark .",
    "a crucial aspect of the statistical hadronization model and , in our opinion , of all models on charmonium production in ultra - relativistic nuclear collisions is to take account of the time sequence of events from the production of charm quarks to the formation of charmonia .",
    "we have discussed this issue in detail . in particular , the formation time of open and hidden charm hadrons is important and , especially at collider energies , likely longer than the collision time or qgp formation time .",
    "this provides further support for the notion of late charmonium production at the phase boundary .",
    "a key feature of the statistical hadronization approach is the scaling of charmonium with the square of the number of charm quark pairs in the fireball .",
    "we have argued that first traces of this scaling are already visible in the rhic data on charmonium production .",
    "data from the lhc will provide a crucial test for this approach .",
    "the authors would like to recognize the continued and very fruitful collaboration with a. andronic and k. redlich , with whom many of the ideas and results discussed in this review have been worked out .",
