    "binary systems of two neutron stars ( nss ) or a neutron star and a stellar - mass black hole ( bh ) are possible sources of gravitational waves ( gws ) for current @xcite and future @xcite gw interferometers .",
    "to extract information from these waves the stages of the coalescence must be modelled accurately . when the binary separation @xmath1 is large ( such that @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the radius of the ns ) , analytic post - newtonian ( pn ) methods @xcite can describe the binary dynamics accurately enough to allow detection and parameter extraction .",
    "however , as the binary separation decreases , the pn approximation ( which assumes weak gravity and slow motion ) becomes less and less accurate . at some point",
    "the system must be modelled by numerical simulations that account for strong gravitational fields and hydrodynamic effects .",
    "several groups have developed numerical codes to simulate ns / ns systems ( e.g. , see @xcite and refs .",
    "7 - 15 of @xcite ) .",
    "the detection of gws from ns / ns coalescences could yield information about the equation of state ( eos ) of ultradense nuclear matter , and about short - duration gamma - ray bursts @xcite .",
    "accurate predictions of the gw signal will be important for these purposes .",
    "wilson , mathews , and marronetti ( wmm ) @xcite were one of the first groups to simulate the hydrodynamics of ns / ns mergers in general relativity .",
    "their simulations made the surprising prediction that relativistic effects can compress neutron stars that are near their maximum mass , initiating collapse to black holes prior to the onset of the dynamical orbital instability that causes the stars to plunge and merge .",
    "this prediction , which is referred to by some as `` star - crushing '' or `` binary - induced collapse , '' was highly controversial and ran counter to intuition obtained from the newtonian result that a ns in a binary is more stable against collapse @xcite .",
    "if true , this collapse instability would have important implications for the detection of ns / ns binaries using matched filtering .",
    "the energy loss from the collapse process would change the orbital phase and introduce additional eos - dependent parameters in the inspiral waveform templates . over 15 papers appeared in the literature refuting wmm s claim .",
    "details of this controversy are reviewed in sec .",
    "[ sec : history ] below and in @xcite .",
    "kennefick @xcite provides a very interesting and readable account of the controversy from a sociological viewpoint .",
    "the wmm controversy largely subsided once flanagan @xcite discovered an error in one of wmm s equations .",
    "although correcting this error caused a substantial decrease in the crushing effect , some compression of the neutron stars remained @xcite .",
    "various analytic @xcite and numerical @xcite studies have claimed to rule out the star - crushing effect . however , none of these studies considered certain post - newtonian , velocity - dependent tidal couplings or they constrained the ns velocity field to be either initially vanishing , corotating ( where the nss are rigidly rotating at the orbital frequency ) , irrotational ( the ns fluid velocity has vanishing curl ) , or described by ellipsoidal models ( in which the velocity field is a linear function of the distance from the star s center of mass ) ; see sec .  [ sec : history ] for further discussion .",
    "these approximations have left open a loophole in the demonstration that the central density of a neutron star should always _ decrease _ when placed in a binary system .",
    "specifically , there remains the possibility that gravitomagnetic tidal interactions could couple to complex velocity patterns inside a neutron star , causing the central density to _ increase_. the purpose of this paper is to investigate whether such a mechanism can explain the residual compression observed in wmm s revised simulations @xcite and , more importantly , to address the following general question : are there any circumstances under which general - relativistic tidal forces can compress a neutron star ?",
    "we find that there is a compression effect which can be briefly summarized as follows : in addition to the familiar newtonian tidal field of its companion , the fluid of each ns also interacts with a gravitomagnetic tidal field generated by the motion of its companion . if the ns fluid has a nonzero current - quadrupole moment , velocity - dependent tidal forces can lead to compression of the star , increasing its central density in certain circumstances and making it more susceptible to gravitational collapse .    to describe this mechanism in mathematical language , begin by considering a nonrotating neutron star with mass @xmath4 and radius @xmath3 interacting with the tidal field of a binary companion with mass @xmath5 a distance @xmath1 away .",

    "@xmath12 @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the star s self - gravitational newtonian potential , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the newtonian and gravitomagnetic potentials describing the external tidal field . inside and near the star these potentials satisfy a subset of the first post - newtonian ( 1pn ) einstein field equations , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the ns s mass density .",

    "we assume geometric units with @xmath8 .",
    "time and space coordinates are denoted by @xmath68 .",

    "spatial partial derivatives are denoted by @xmath70 and time derivatives are denoted by an overdot , @xmath71 .",
    "spacetime indices and covariant derivatives are rarely used .",
    "to help motivate our analysis , it is useful to review the history of the star - crushing controversy , focusing on the arguments for and against crushing and the approximations that are assumed in the various arguments .",
    "we begin by reviewing the original wmm simulations .",
    "wmm s simulations @xcite relied on two important assumptions , which have come to be called the wilson - mathews approximation : first , the spatial metric satisfies the spatial conformal flatness ( scf ) condition , @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the 3-metric of a spacelike hypersurface and @xmath74 is the conformal factor .",
    "the scf condition simplifies the form of the hydrodynamic and field equations , neglects gravitational radiation in the spatial 3-metric , and is generally accurate only to 1pn order .",
    "however , it is exact for situations with spherical symmetry and very accurate for rapidly rotating relativistic stars @xcite .",
    "although widely used by many groups , the scf condition was suspected by some to be the source of wmm s crushing effect ( but see sec .",
    "[ sec : wmmresolve ] below ) .",
    "the second assumption is a quasiequilibrium approximation in which the terms involving the time derivatives of the gravitational degrees of freedom ( the spatial metric @xmath73 and extrinsic curvature @xmath75 ) are dropped from the equations of motion .",
    "this is thought to be a good approximation at large separations when gws hardly modify the orbital dynamics .",
    "combined with the scf condition , this assumption reduces the equations for the gravitational field to flat - space elliptic equations .",
    "given an initial matter distribution , wmm first solve the momentum and hamiltonian constraint equations for the gravitational field .",
    "the hydrodynamics equations ( coupled to the gravitational field ) are then evolved to the next time slice . instead of also evolving the gravitational field variables ,",
    "the constraint equations are solved again at that time slice and the process is iterated .",
    "gravitational waves are calculated via a multipole expansion and their effect on the neutron stars is accounted for by adding a radiation - reaction potential to the hydrodynamics equations .",
    "wmm also employ what they refer to as a `` realistic equation of state '' .",
    "this zero - temperature , zero - neutrino - potential eos @xcite is softer ( smaller values of @xmath76 ) than polytropic equations of state used by other groups and shows greater compression in their simulations .",
    "this eos was motivated by matching models of sn 1987a to the observed neutrino signal @xcite .",
    "unlike most other ns / ns simulations of that time , the wmm simulations used _",
    "unconstrained hydrodynamics_they did not constrain the binary to be corotating or irrotational . even though more recent ns / ns simulations also use unconstrained hydrodynamics ( @xcite and references therein ) , they all constrain the stars in their initial data sets to be either corotating or irrotational . in the wmm simulations , the initial data is formulated differently ( sec .  iii of @xcite ) : an initial `` guess '' solution from the tolmen - oppenheimer - volkoff equation for each star is placed on the grid in a corotating configuration .",
    "the stars are then allowed to relax to an equilibrium configuration .",
    "this is accomplished by solving the field equations and evolving the hydrodynamics without radiation reaction .",
    "an artificial damping of the fluid motion is imposed and slowly removed as stars reach an equilibrium state .",
    "the resulting equilibrium configurations are neither corotational nor irrotational , but result in stars with almost no intrinsic spin ( sec .",
    "iv e of @xcite ) . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : preexisting ] , this method of choosing the initial data sets could possibly be the source of compression .",
    "the main result of the initial wmm simulations was that initially stable neutron stars could be highly compressed : a star @xmath77 from its maximum mass has a change @xmath78 of its central density @xmath79 given by @xmath80 at a proper separation of @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "the simulations indicated that the central density increased according to @xmath82 , where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the spatial components of the 4-velocity ( see fig .  2 of @xcite ) .",
    "wmm also found that the binary s orbit would become unstable at an orbital separation that was larger ( by a factor of @xmath85 ) than the pn prediction @xcite .    in the years following wmm s initial publications , several papers appeared claiming that neutron stars in a binary should be stabilized and not compressed .",
    "these were followed by a rebuttal paper by wmm @xcite .",
    "lai @xcite used an energy variational principle ( including 1pn corrections to the star s self - gravity ) to show that a newtonian tidal field decreases the central density according to @xmath86 ( for an @xmath87 polytrope at its maximum mass in isolation ; see also @xcite and appendix [ app : stabilization ] of this paper ) .",
    "wiseman @xcite showed that there was no change in central density in a binary at 1pn order , but he neglected tidal effects .",

    "although these papers @xcite consistently applied their approximations , they did not include the velocity - dependent forces that wmm attribute their compression to @xcite , and they did not consider the gravitomagnetic interactions that we investigate here .",

    "shibata et  al .",
    "@xcite performed 1pn hydrodynamics simulations for corotating and irrotational binaries and also saw no signs of compression .",
    "wmm speculated that this was due to the unrealistically soft eos ( with @xmath90 ) used by shibata et al .  @xcite .",
    "for the very close separations examined in that paper , wmm claimed that the tidal stabilization overwhelms any compression effect @xcite .    in a series of papers , baumgarte et  al .",
    "@xcite simulated corotating ns / ns binaries using the scf and quasiequilibrium conditions , finding that the stars were stabilized .",
    "however , their simulations did not contradict the wmm results since the centrifugal force tends to stabilize the star in corotating binaries .",
    "further , wmm showed analytically that their compression effect vanishes for corotation @xcite .",
    "this indicated to wmm that the compression was probably due to the nonrigidly - rotating motion set up in the ns fluid @xcite .",

    "this minimum is only marginally stable .",
    "the external tidal forces perturb the test particles about this minimum .",

    "when the tidal perturbation is small the particle rolls `` up the hill '' of the potential and then rolls back to the stable minimum .",
    "but if the tidal perturbation is large enough , the particle can be forced over the local maximum of the potential , causing it to plunge into the bh s event horizon .",
    "adding additional ( magneticlike ) tidal fields simply provides an additional force that will cause more particles to become unstable .",

    "miller performed binary ns simulations in full general relativity and found that the central density decreases with decreasing orbital separation according to @xmath342 . because the nss in his simulations were initially corotating , miller s results do not directly contradict those of wilson and mathews ( their stars relax to a configuration of almost no intrinsic spin ; see sec .

    "<S> numerical simulations of binary neutron stars by wilson , mathews , and marronetti indicated that neutron stars that are stable in isolation can be made to collapse to black holes when placed in a binary . </S>",
    "<S> this claim was surprising as it ran counter to the newtonian expectation that a neutron star in a binary should be more stable , not less . </S>",
    "<S> after correcting an error found by flanagan , wilson and mathews found that the compression of the neutron stars was significantly reduced but not eliminated . </S>",
    "<S> this has motivated us to ask the following general question : under what circumstances can general - relativistic tidal interactions cause an otherwise stable neutron star to be compressed ? we have found that if a nonrotating neutron star possesses a current - quadrupole moment , interactions with a gravitomagnetic tidal field can lead to a compressive force on the star . </S>",
    "<S> if this current quadrupole is induced by the gravitomagnetic tidal field , it is related to the tidal field by an equation - of - state - dependent constant called the _ </S>",
    "<S> gravitomagnetic love number_. this is analogous to the newtonian love number that relates the strength of a newtonian tidal field to the induced mass quadrupole moment of a star . </S>",
    "<S> the compressive force is almost never larger than the newtonian tidal interaction that stabilizes the neutron star against collapse . in the case </S>",
    "<S> in which a current quadrupole is already present in the star ( perhaps as an artifact of a numerical simulation ) , the compressive force can exceed the stabilizing one , leading to a net increase in the central density of the star . </S>",
    "<S> this increase is small ( @xmath0 ) but could , in principle , cause gravitational collapse in a star that is close to its maximum mass . </S>",
    "<S> this paper also reviews the history of the wilson - mathews - marronetti controversy and , in an appendix , extends the discussion of tidally - induced changes in the central density to rotating stars . </S>"
