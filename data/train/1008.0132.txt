    "spin - orbit ( so ) coupled two - dimensional electron systems are of great interest , both as model systems and as the active component of devices that control electron spin with electric fields.@xcite unfortunately , the potential of the so interaction to control electron spin comes with a price - the so terms in the hamiltonian break su(2 ) spin symmetry .",
