    "weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) are important study targets in current and future collider experiments since the wimps provide a solution to the dark matter problem . in this study , we investigate the prospects of discovering the direct pair production of wimps at the international linear collider ( ilc ) using the energy and angle spectra of the photons from initial state radiation ( isr )  @xcite .",
    "we make the assumption that , among the particles beyond the standard model , the wimps are the only kinematically accessible at the center - of - mass ( cm ) energy of 500  gev proposed for the ilc .",
    "similar past searches using single photons have been performed by e.g.  @xcite .",
    "prospects of such measurements have been discussed in many literature  @xcite and , in particular , at the ilc  @xcite which uses a cut - and - count approach .",
    "our method uses the two - dimensional energy and angle distributions of the isr photon and thus exploits the full information of the event .",
    "we apply this method to an example case of minimal supergravity ( msugra )  @xcite in which the neutralino is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) .",
    "the msugra parameters have been chosen so that the lsp becomes bino - like ; under this assumption , the dominant contribution to the neutralino pair production becomes the @xmath0-channel diagram shown in figure  [ fig : tchannel ] .",

    "signal samples were generated with two different lsp masses by varying the msugra parameter @xmath3 , resulting in lsp masses of approximately 150 and 200  gev .",

    "the angle is folded around @xmath16 , to exploit the symmetry of the distribution .",
    "the bin size is adjusted to ensure the presence of sufficient signal events in each bin .",
    "the log likelihood ratio is defined as follows : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the observed number of events in the @xmath19-th bin , @xmath20 is the expected number of background events in the @xmath19-th bin , @xmath21 is the expected number of signal events in the @xmath19-th bin , and @xmath22 is the poisson probability density function with the expectation value of @xmath23 . the @xmath24  gev sample was used to build the template signal shape ; the same signal shape was used to build likelihood functions even for different masses in the subsequent analysis , since the true mass is not known _ a priori_.",
    "the likelihood distributions are obtained by performing monte - carlo test experiments whereby the observed number of events in each bin is fluctuated using poissonian random numbers .",
    "the resulting likelihood distributions for background plus signal events ( @xmath25 ) are compared with that for background events only ( @xmath26 ) to compute the probability for observing the wimp signal , as shown in figure  [ fig : ne1ne1a - likelidist ] .",

    "the vertical axis is the probability density for a given log - likelihood value . ]    from this distribution , we calculate the expected significance for each neutralino mass .",
    "we estimate the significance by computing the probability that the backgrounds fluctuate to deviate more than the median of the signal likelihood . in the case of @xmath12  gev ,",
    "the estimated significance is 3.1@xmath27 ; in the case of @xmath24  gev , the estimated significance is well above 5@xmath27 .",
    "the difference in the significance between the two cases is mostly due to the difference in the cross section .    in the case of a more general wimp scenario ,",
    "the dependence of the signal cross section on the wimp mass is expected to be considerably different . in order to take this effect into account",
    ", we performed a scan of likelihood values by varying the wimp mass and the cross section independently .",
    "the best signal separation power can be attained when the correct signal template function is used ; assuming this is the case , we keep our msugra signal template .",
    "additional signal samples were generated using 15 different wimp mass points ranging from 100  gev to 240  gev by varying @xmath3 .",
    "for this study , we use the beam polarizations of @xmath28 .",
    "we obtain the cross section limit , defined as the cross section which gives a 50% probability of 5@xmath27 observation , as a function of the wimp mass .",
    "integrated over the kinematically allowed region in this analysis . ]    for a given mass , we adjusted the cross section until it yielded the desired probability of observing the signal .",
    "we performed @xmath29 monte - carlo test experiments at each step of testing the cross section .",
    "a binary search was used to find the cross section limit efficiently .",
    "the cross section limit as a function of the wimp mass is plotted in figure  [ fig : ne1ne1a - mscan ] . if the cross section is at least 14  fb , the wimp can be observed . around the mass of 200  gev , the required cross section increases since the likelihood function",
    "is constructed using the template signal shape for @xmath24  gev .",
    "as the wimp mass approaches 250  gev , the required cross section becomes smaller since the photon energy distribution peaks at the low energy region , thereby allowing it to be discriminated against the background shape .",
    "note , however , that if one fixes the model and let the mass approach 250 gev , the cross section decreases faster than the cross - section limit .",
    "thus , this result is consistent with the fact that the heavier neutralino is more difficult to observe .",
    "we have looked at the msugra neutralino search as an example of a wimp search with single photons using the two - dimensional distribution of the isr photon energy and the angle .",
    "we compared the likelihood distributions and calculated the probability to achieve 5@xmath27 observation . in our msugra model ,",
    "the @xmath24  gev case can be easily observed , while the @xmath12  gev case has the significance of 3.1@xmath27 .",
    "we obtained cross - section limits as a function of the neutralino mass .",
    "wimps created through the @xmath0-channel with the cross section of over 15  fb can be observed with the 5@xmath27 significance at the ilc with @xmath30 gev . in principle , this method can be applied to a broader class of wimp searches with isr photons .",
