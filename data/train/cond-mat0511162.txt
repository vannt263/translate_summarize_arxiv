    "the idea of implementing quantum information processing schemes on charge states in quantum dot ( qd ) systems @xcite has recently been supported by an experimental demonstration @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it has been proposed that quantum bits encoded in electron spins ( which have much longer dephasing times ) may be optically controlled by inducing charge dynamics within various schemes exploiting selection rules and pauli blocking @xcite .",
    "moreover , the demonstration of a qd - based photodiode operating in the quantum coherent regime @xcite shows great promise for quantum optoelectronic applications .",
    "these experimental achievements and theoretical proposals have driven a lot of investigation on coherence properties of qd systems , in particular under external driving of carrier dynamics .",
    "limitations to the coherent control of confined carriers in qds result , on one side , from finite lifetime of charge states used for information encoding ; one restriction is imposed , for instance , by radiative decay ( on nanosecond time scale @xcite ) of confined excitons that seemed to be the most natural charge qubit systems due to relative ease of ultrafast optical driving @xcite . on the other side , optical experiments",
    "@xcite have demonstrated that pure dephasing processes destroy coherence of the system state to a large extent within a few picoseconds after creating the state .",
    "this has been attributed to carrier - phonon interaction @xcite and interpreted in terms of spontaneous relaxation of the lattice after an optically induced change of the confined charge distribution , accompanied by emission of phonon wave packets @xcite , which creates a kind of _ which way _ trace in the crystal @xcite and results in dephasing .",
    "the same phonon response to the charge evolution leads also to dephasing in optical spin control schemes @xcite .",
    "the phonon - induced dephasing effect may be avoided by driving the system evolution adiabatically with respect to phonon dynamics @xcite , which requires long driving times and leads to growing probability of exciton decay during the operation .",
    "optimal driving conditions correspond to a tradeoff between these two dephasing effects @xcite . as a result ,",
    "maximum fidelity of a coherent quantum control operation on a given system is limited .",
    "one way to partly circumvent this limitation is optimizing the pulse shape @xcite .",
    "another solution might be to modify the properties of the phonon reservoir by placing the dot near the crystal surface @xcite or in an acoustic cavity @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach is to overcome the physical restrictions imposed by dephasing processes on the quantum - logical level .",
    "if the reservoir acts collectively on a register composed of a number of charge qubits then subspaces exist which are safe against decoherence @xcite . in principle",
    ", this idea can be used to implement robust logical qubits on qd arrays @xcite . in practice , however , protection against decoherence based on collective interaction with the environment ( closely related to the subradiance effect ) may be difficult to achieve in these artificial systems since it requires that the transition energies in all qds are the same . moreover , the phonon - induced pure dephasing effect involves a range of modes selected by the system geometry in such a way that reservoir correlation length roughly corresponds to the single qd size which apparently precludes any collective interaction with a number of qds .    in this paper we show that , in spite of these difficulties , partly noiseless encoding against the pure dephasing effect is possible .",
    "we focus our discussion on the case of an excitonic charge qubit . in analogy to the original idea of noiseless encoding@xcite , we will identify two states of an array of quantum dots which span a subspace ( logical qubit ) that , under appropriate driving conditions , allows performing single - qubit operations at reduced error , i.e. , with relatively little lattice response , compared to switching of a single excitonic physical qubit . physically , the collective encoding approach in this case relies on the fact that the pure dephasing effect is of dynamical character and results exclusively from nonadiabaticity of the driving @xcite . for a given speed of rotation in the qubit space ,",
    "it involves only slow modes that can not follow the evolution of charge distribution , while faster modes follow adiabatically and reversibly . in this way ,",
    "only a long wave length part of all the coupled modes is relevant for the dynamics . since the range of these slow modes",
    "is selected dynamically , independently of the system geometry , it may correspond ( under suitable driving conditions ) to wave lengths larger than the register ( qd array ) size , thus allowing for collective interaction .    in the present proposal ,",
    "the logical qubit is defined on a system of @xmath0 quantum dots ( physical qubits ) in such a way that the logical @xmath1 state corresponds to the presence of an exciton in each of the appropriately chosen @xmath2 dots , while in the logical @xmath3 state the other half of the dots are occupied . with the correct definition of the logical qubit ,",
    "the excitations of the phonon reservoir induced by the evolution of charges in all qds interfere destructively in the long wave length sector , leading to a decrease of dephasing .",
    "the proposed scheme works only for relatively slow evolution and the resulting fidelity gain is again restricted by finite lifetimes .",
    "we will study how much the overall error may be reduced depending on the exciton lifetime and the strength of other decoherence processes .",
    "it should be stressed that the scheme proposed here does not assume that the individual dots in the register are identical .",

    "since considerable destructive interference of phonon excitations is unlikely to appear over the whole wide frequency sector of the phonon spectral density , it may be expected that driving a number of dots simultaneously should lead to more excitation of the phonon reservoir and to more dephasing . in terms of the spectral densities ( fig .",

    "this situation changes for longer pulses ( @xmath122 ps ) .",
    "now only the long wavelength phonons contribute to dephasing . from the general discussion presented above it is clear that for sufficiently long pulses large collective qubits will lead to lower phonon - induced error than smaller ones due to more favorable scaling of the error with the pulse duration .",

    "[ fig : dyn3d ] the value of @xmath81 decreases for long enough pulses ( @xmath123 ps ) according to a power - law dependence with higher negative exponents for larger arrays .",

    "such an effect might quantitatively reduce dephasing but could not change the exponent of the low - frequency behavior of @xmath121 .",
    "moreover , the reduction of @xmath121 at @xmath115 appears only for the special definitions of logical qubits shown in fig .",

    "@xmath51 , corresponding to full rabi rotations around the bloch sphere , the error dependence on the pulse duration becomes more complicated due to the presence of many maxima in @xmath96 ( fig .",

( [ ff - av ] ) ] is shifted towards larger momenta and the total area of the phonon spectral density grows .",

    "the modulation of @xmath121 resulting from the multi - qd interference attains a longer period @xmath128 and the sector of low frequencies , where the spectral densities @xmath116 are ordered according to their asymptotic power - law behavior , extends [ see fig .  [ fig : spectral](b ) ] .",
    "now , the improved behavior of the spectral densities is fully reflected by the reduced values of errors for growing number of qds in the array already for @xmath129 fs .",
    "the linear layout allows the dots to be tightly stacked along the direction of smallest size ( growth direction of the semiconductor structure ) but , on the other hand , results in a growing distance between the physical qubits on the opposite ends of the chain .",

    "the dynamically induced pure dephasing is not the only error source .",
    "additional error comes from the finite exciton lifetime and other processes , including phonon - assisted transitions to excited exciton states @xcite , dephasing by phonon scattering @xcite and probably other effects whose exact nature seems to be poorly understood .",

    "in the first one , @xmath99 is independent of @xmath4 ( which assumes some kind of collective action of the dephasing ) , while in the second one it is proportional to @xmath134 ( which corresponds to individual decoherence of the physical qubits ) .",

    "the discussion presented above shows that engineering of the effective phonon spectral density by collective encoding of a logical qubit in an array of physical ( excitonic ) qubits may lead to a reduction of the phonon - induced dephasing during control operations on the qubit .",
    "this is possible since for long enough pulses ( slow driving ) only long - wavelength part of the phonon reservoir is involved in the dephasing dynamics which extends the effective correlation length of the reservoir and opens the possibility for collective encoding .",
    "such collective encoding reduces the total error resulting from the joint action of various dephasing mechanisms and increases the gain from possible further extension of the exciton life times . with the collective encoding it seems feasible to reduce the total error for a single - qubit operation to values of order of @xmath141 even at the relatively high temperature of @xmath138 k , which is remarkable in view of the recent progress in the quantum error correction theory under realistically strong dephasing @xcite .",
    "the present analysis was restricted to gaussian pulses .",

    "the reach structure of the effective phonon spectral density for collective qubits suggests that combining the pulse shaping techniques with the collective encoding may be very fruitful .",
    "another possibility of reducing the overall error might be to combine the collective encoding against dynamical dephasing with the noiseless ( subradiant ) encoding against radiative decay @xcite .    in more general terms",
    ", our discussion shows that certain details of the phonon spectral density may be of essential importance for the dephasing of a system driven by finite pulses . obviously , the system response to an ultrashort pulse , as observed in optical experiments @xcite , yields valuable information on the overall strength of the phonon - induced dephasing .",
    "however , we have seen that the degree of decoherence for finite pulses is governed only by the low - frequency part of the relevant spectral function and may decrease even though the dephasing in the ultrafast limit increases ( e.g. , for arrays of smaller but more closely spaced qds ) .",
    "it is therefore possible that systems based on various materials @xcite and restricted geometries @xcite may offer previously unnoticed possibilities in the slow driving regime .",
    "understanding of the peculiarities of the carrier - phonon dynamics underlying the dephasing of driven systems may also be helpful for designing robust schemes for the optical control of spin qubits .",
