    "when two parallel plates with corrugations are situated close to each other , besides the usual casimir attraction that takes place between them @xcite , there exists another contribution to the attraction that depends on the corrugations of the surface of the plates and therefore , on the non - normal coordinates ( in the case of the parallel plates this coordinate is along the parallel surfaces where the corrugations are imposed , and in the case of the concentric cylinders this coordinate is the azimuthal angle with origin at the center of the cylinders ) .",
    "this new term gives rise to a lateral force or torque that could , in principle , make one plate slide with respect to the other or one cylinder rotate with respect to the other .",
    "here we discuss such a situation .",

    "we divide the paper in two relevant parts . the first one is devoted to corrugated parallel plates .",
    "we show and discuss the perturbative results for two limiting cases , strong and weak - coupling .",
    "the weak - coupling limit is also compared with an exact calculation and the pfa solution .",
    "the second part of the paper shows the results for corrugated concentric cylinders .",
    "we give perturbative results for both the dirichlet and the weak - coupling limits .",
    "we extrapolate these results to the case of very large radii of the cylinders while keeping constant the distance between them .",
    "this situation corresponds to parallel plates .",
    "let s consider two semitransparent plates lying on the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane and placed parallel to each other .",
    "the plates have corrugations on the facing surfaces along the @xmath1-axes .",
    "we consider translational invariance on the @xmath0-axes and we work at a given frequency .",
    "the average distance between the parallel slabs is @xmath2 and we model the corrugations by the functions @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "these are defined such that at any point the inequality @xmath5 holds .",
    "for the cases studied here we choose sinusoidal corrugations , @xmath6 .",
    "each plate is described by a potential of the form , @xmath7 where @xmath8 are labels that identify the individual plates . in this way",
    "we can consider our system as two semitransparent parallel plates making up the background and described by the potentials @xmath9 for @xmath10 . on the top of it",
    "we have the corrugations @xmath11 which can be considered to be a perturbation of the background ( see ) .",

    "this gives rise to a force in the lateral direction , the so - called lateral casimir force , @xmath16    since the corrugations can be considered a perturbation over the background @xmath17 , we can easily extract their contribution by calculating the deviation of the total potential @xmath18 from that of the background , @xmath19^n}{n ! } \\frac{\\partial^n}{\\partial z^n } v_i^{(0)}(z ) =   \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty v_i^{(n)}(z , y).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the key formula to calculate the casimir energy is @xcite , @xmath20 where the green s function @xmath21 satisfies a differential equation with a potential function that describes the corrugations in both semitransparent plates , @xmath22 g = 1,\\ ] ] and the corresponding green s function associated with the background obeys the differential equation @xmath23 g^{(0 ) } = 1 , \\label{g0eqn}\\ ] ] where the corrugations are not present .",
    "however , since only the term containing the perturbative potential in both plates play a role in determining the lateral casimir force , we can reduce the above more general formula to @xmath24 , \\label{lateralce}\\ ] ] where now @xmath25 refers to the green s function when only one of the plates has corrugations on it .",

    "the general formulas turn out to be very long and complicated and they will not be shown here ( details of the calculation as well as final formulas can be found in @xcite ) ; here we focus on the solutions for the dirichlet and weak coupling limits .      here",
