    "a system of equations is @xmath0-symmetric if it is invariant with respect to combined parity ( @xmath1 ) and time - reversal ( @xmath2 ) transformations .",
    "the symmetry is interesting as it forms a particular class of non - hermitian hamiltonians in quantum mechanics @xcite , that may have a real spectrum up to a critical value of the complex potential parameter , above which the system is in the broken @xmath0  symmetry phase @xcite .    the most basic configuration having @xmath0symmetry is a dimer , i.e.  a system of two coupled oscillators where one of the oscillators has damping losses and the other one gains energy from external sources .",
    "considerably dimers are also the most important @xmath0  systems as the concept of @xmath0  symmetry was first realised experimentally on dimers consisting of two coupled optical waveguides @xcite ( see also the review @xcite for @xmath0  symmetry in optical applications ) .",
    "the experiments have been rapidly followed by many other observations of @xmath0  symmetry in different branches of physics , from mechanical to electrical analogues ( see the review @xcite ) .",
    "when nonlinearity is present in a @xmath0  system , nontrivial behaviours may emerge that cease to exist in the linear case , such as the presence of blow - up dynamics in the parameter region of the unbroken phase in the linear counterpart @xcite .",
    "when nonlinear dimers are put in arrays where elements with gain and loss are linearly coupled to the elements of the same type belonging to adjacent dimers , one can also obtain a distinctive feature in the form of the existence of solutions localized in space as continuous families of their energy parameter @xcite .",
    "the system therefore has two arms with each arm described by a discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation with gain or loss . here , we study the nonlinear localised solutions , which loosely we also refer to as bright discrete solitons , and their stability analytically and numerically .",
    "in the continuous limit , the coupled equations without gain - loss have been studied in @xcite , where it has been shown that the system admits symmetric , antisymmetric and asymmetric solitons between the arms .",
    "unstable asymmetric solutions bifurcate from the symmetric ones through a subcritical symmetry breaking bifurcation , which then become stable after a tangent ( saddle - center ) bifurcation .",
    "when one adds a gain and loss term in each arm , one obtains @xmath0-symmetric couplers , which have been considered in @xcite . in the presence of the linear - gain and loss terms , asymmetric",
    "solitons cease to exist , while antisymmetric solitons are always unstable @xcite , even though those with small amplitudes can live long due to weak underlying instability @xcite .",
    "symmetric solitons can be stable in a similar fashion to those in the system without gain - loss @xcite .",
    "the stability of bright discrete solitons in @xmath0-symmetric couplers was discussed in @xcite using variational methods , where it was shown that symmetric onsite solutions can be stable and there is a critical solution amplitude above which the @xmath0  symmetry is broken .",
    "the same equations without gain and loss were considered in @xcite where the symmetric soliton loses its stability through the symmetry - breaking bifurcation at a finite value of the energy , similarly to that in the continuous counterpart @xcite . recently a similar @xmath0  chain of dimers with a slightly different nonlinearity was derived @xcite to describe coupled chains of parametrically driven pendula as a mechanical analogue of @xmath0-symmetric systems @xcite .",
    "the stability of bright discrete solitons was established through the applications of the hamiltonian energy and an index theorem .",
    "the nonlinear long - time stability of the discrete solitons was also established using the lyapunov method in the asymptotic limit of a weak coupling between the pendula @xcite . here , we complement the aforementioned results by presenting asymptotic expansions of the eigenvalues of the discrete solitons .",
    "explicit expressions are obtained by exploiting the asymptotic limit of weak coupling between the dimers and the small coefficient of the gain - loss terms .",
    "the manuscript is outlined as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present the mathematical model . in section 3 ,",
    "we use perturbation theory for small @xmath3 to analyse the existence of fundamental localised solutions .",
    "such analysis is based on the concept of the so - called anticontinuum limit approach .",
    "the stability of the solitons is then considered analytically in section 4 by solving a corresponding eigenvalue problem . in this section , in addition to small coupling , the expansion is also performed under the assumption of small coefficient of the gain - loss term due to the non - simple expression of the eigenvectors of the linearised operator .",
    "the findings obtained from the analytical calculations are then compared with the numerical counterparts in section 5 .",
    "we also produce stability regions for all the fundamental solitons numerically . in this section ,",
    "we present the typical dynamics of solitons in the unstable parameter ranges by direct numerical integrations of the governing equation .",
    "we present the conclusion in section 6 .",
    "the governing equations describing @xmath0-symmetric chains of dimers are of the form @xcite @xmath4 the derivative with respect to the evolution variable ( i.e. , the propagation distance , if we consider their application in fiber optics ) is denoted by the overdot , @xmath5 , @xmath6 are complex - valued wave function at site @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the constant coefficient of the horizontal linear coupling ( coupling constant between two adjacent sites ) , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the discrete laplacian term in one spatial dimension , the gain and loss acting on complex variables @xmath11 , @xmath12 are represented by the positive coefficient @xmath13 , i.e.  @xmath14 .",
    "the nonlinearity coefficient is denoted by @xmath15 , which can be scaled to @xmath16 without loss of generality due to the case of focusing nonlinearity that we consider .",
    "bright discrete soliton solutions satisfy the localisation conditions @xmath17 as @xmath18 .",
    "the focusing system has static localised solutions that can be obtained from substituting @xmath19 into ( [ 1 ] ) to yield the equations @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 are complex - valued and the propagation constant @xmath23 .",
    "in the uncoupled limit , i.e.  when @xmath24 , the chain ( [ 1 ] ) becomes the equations for the dimer .",
    "the static equation ( [ 2 ] ) has been analysed in details in @xcite , where it was shown that there is a relation between @xmath25 and @xmath13 above which there is no time - independent solution to ( [ 2 ] ) ( see also the analysis below ) . when @xmath3 is nonzero , but small enough , the existence of solutions emanating from the uncoupled limit can be shown using the implicit function theorem .",
    "the existence analysis of @xcite can be adopted here despite the slightly different nonlinearity . however , below we will not state the theorem and instead derive the asymptotic series of the solutions .    using perturbation expansion , solutions of the coupler ( [ 2 ] ) for small coupling constant @xmath3",
    "can be expressed analytically as @xmath26 by substituting the above expansions into eq .",

    "( [ 15 ] ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath34 can be taken as 0 , due to the gauge phase invariance of the governing equation ( [ 1 ] ) and henceforth @xmath35 or @xmath36 .",
    "the former phase corresponds to the so - called symmetric configuration between the arms , while the latter is called antisymmetric one .",
    "herein , we also refer to the symmetric and antisymmetric soliton as soliton i and ii , respectively .",
    "equation [ aaa ] informs us that @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the necessary condition for soliton i and ii , respectively .    for the first order correction due to the weak coupling , writing @xmath39 , @xmath40 and substituting it into equations ( [ 15a ] ) will yield @xmath41    equations ( [ 14]),([an]),([aaa]),([a1b1 ] ) are the asymptotic expansion of the intersite solitons .",
    "one can continue the same calculation to obtain higher order corrections , which for the sake of simplicity is left for the interested reader .      for the onsite soliton , i.e. , a one - excited - site discrete mode",
    ", one can perform the same computations to obtain the mode structure of the form @xmath42 with ( [ aaa ] ) and the first order correction from ( [ 15a ] ) @xmath43",
    "after we find discrete solitons , their linear stability is then determined by solving a corresponding linear eigenvalue problem .",

    "<S> we study the existence and stability of fundamental bright discrete solitons in a parity - time ( @xmath0)-symmetric coupler composed by a chain of dimers , that is modelled by linearly coupled discrete nonlinear schrdinger equations with gain and loss terms . </S>",
    "<S> we use a perturbation theory for small coupling between the lattices to perform the analysis , which is then confirmed by numerical calculations . </S>",
    "<S> such analysis is based on the concept of the so - called anti - continuum limit approach . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the fundamental onsite and intersite bright solitons . </S>",
    "<S> each solution has symmetric and antisymmetric configurations between the arms . </S>",
    "<S> the stability of the solutions is then determined by solving the corresponding eigenvalue problem . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain that both symmetric and antisymmetric onsite mode can be stable for small coupling , on the contrary of the reported continuum limit where the antisymmetric solutions are always unstable . </S>",
    "<S> the instability is either due to the internal modes crossing the origin or the appearance of a quartet of complex eigenvalues . in general , the gain - loss term can be considered parasitic as it reduces the stability region of the onsite solitons . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we analyse the dynamic behaviour of the onsite and intersite solitons when unstable , where typically it is either in the form of travelling solitons or soliton blow - ups . </S>"
