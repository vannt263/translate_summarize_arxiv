    "if graphene is coated on the interface of medium 2 and 3 , the force remains unchanged due to the significant screening from the silicon dioxide film .",

    "however , the membrane attraction towards the graphene covered substrate is stronger as compared to the case when only graphene is present .",
    "the fact that @xmath102 differs little for the different substrates at @xmath108 nm in fig.[fig:3 ] shows that the graphene is dominating the van der waals interaction .",
    "finally , we consider the situation of a superlattice substrate with periodic arrangement of @xmath109 alternating layers with different thicknesses ( insert of fig.[fig:4 ] ) covered with a graphene sheet .",
    "one can calculate the permittivities of this system by means of an anisotropic effective dielectric function : @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the fraction of silica in the composite material .",

    "the more significant changes are found in the short distance separation for the different @xmath113 factors .",
    "these results emphasize again the dominating effect of the graphene on the surface of the substrate on the interaction .",
    "it also appears that the first @xmath98 layer affects the magnitude in this distance separation range , similar to the results shown in fig.[fig:3 ] , while the rest of the superlattice has practically no effect on the interaction .",

    "note , however , that @xmath116 should be greater than 25 @xmath97 to avoid the skin depth effects @xcite .",
    "increasing @xmath116 does not modify the van der waals force because the gold thickness 25 @xmath97 can be considered already as a gold semi - infinite space in the lifshitz calculations . prolifering the number of layers",
    "therefore does not introduce any fundamentally new features if compared with a simple two - layer system .",
    "we have studied the van der waals interaction of a phospholipid membrane with a multilayer object involving graphene in water .",
    "a silica thin film repels graphene at distances @xmath96 @xmath97 and the interaction becomes attractive at larger distances .",
    "the position of the transition is independent of the silica thickness due to the fact that the stable separation is much smaller than the considered thickness .",
    "this feature can be exploited to create devices trapping lipid membranes .",
    "the van der waals force in such system can be entirely repulsive by using a graphene sheet on the silica thin film . at @xmath106 @xmath97 ,",
    "the dispersion forces are dominated by the graphene , the silica layer only affects the force at shorter separation distances .",
    "when putting graphene on a composite material of two layers : silica and gold , the influence of the metal layer on the interaction of the graphene with the membrane begin to diverge from the van der waals interaction in the case of the absence of the gold layer at @xmath117 @xmath97 .",
    "this finding suggests that the effect of the layer of gold on this van der waals force can be ignored due to the optical response of graphene on the surface and the screening of the silica thin film .",
    "our result shows that the model of an effective dielectric function for multi - layer systems is not valid for calculations of the van der waals interactions .      5 u. seifert and r. lipowsky , _ structure and dynamics of membranes _ , edited by r. lipowsky and e. sackmann , ( elsevier science , amsterdam , 1995 ) .",
