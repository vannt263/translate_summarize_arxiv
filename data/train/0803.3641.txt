    "recent cosmological observations of distant supernova ia type explosions suggest an accelerating universe ; starting at the cosmological redshift @xmath1@xcite the accelerated expansion should be generated by the so - called dark energy .",
    "these results are in accord with detailed observations of the anisotropies of the microwave cosmic background radiation indicating that the dark energy represents @xmath2 of the energy content in the observable universe@xcite ; the sum of energy densities is very close to the critical energy density @xmath3 corresponding the parabolic universe in concordance with the inflationary cosmological model@xcite .",
    "there is a variety of possible candidates for the dark energy@xcite .",
    "most of the related models have the equation of state with parameter @xmath4 varying during the cosmological expansion .",
    "nevertheless , the recent observational data indicate that the allowed equation of state is very close to the case of constant @xmath5 corresponding to the repulsive cosmological constant @xmath6 with @xmath7@xcite .",
    "therefore , it is quite important to consider the influence of @xmath6 in astrophysically relevant situations quite seriously .",
    "we have tested possible effects of @xmath6 in astrophysically motivated problems@xcite , investigating namely the properties of black - hole solutions of einstein equations for the test - particle motion in schwarzschild - de sitter ( sds)@xcite and kerr - de sitter ( kds)@xcite spacetimes and the test perfect fluid in sds@xcite and kds@xcite spacetimes .",
    "further , the test - particle and fluid properties were treated also in the framework of the optical reference geometry@xcite allowing introduction of inertial forces in the intuitively natural newtonian way@xcite .",
    "the influence of the repulsive cosmological constant on the black - hole spacetime structure can be properly represented by the dimensionless cosmological parameter @xmath8 . for sds black holes admitting existence of stable circular geodesics , i.e. , existence of accretion discs , the cosmological parameter @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the cosmological tests using the supernova magnitude - redshift relation and the cosmic microwave background radiation fluctuations measurements@xcite imply @xmath10@xmath11 , and thus very low values of @xmath12 for astrophysically realistic black holes .",
    "in fact , @xmath13 for super - massive black holes@xcite ; strong optical observable effects could be expected for super - giant black holes@xcite ( or clusters of galaxies ) with @xmath14 .",
    "can be much closer to @xmath15 .",
    "considering the electroweak phase transition at @xmath16gev , we obtain an estimate of the primordial effective cosmological constant @xmath17@xmath11 , while at the level of the quark confinement at @xmath18gev we obtain @xmath19@xmath11 and consequently higher values of @xmath12 @xcite . ]    for astrophysically realistic sds black holes , the strong gravity near the black hole horizon @xmath20 weakens with distance growing and at @xmath21 can be described quite well by the newtonian theory . however , the newtonian theory looses its validity near the so - called static radius @xmath22 , where the repulsive effect of the cosmological constant starts to be relevant up to the other strong gravitation region near the cosmological horizon @xmath23 . therefore , the cosmological constant has relevant influence on the structure of disc configurations ( both geometrically thin and thick ) introducing quite naturally outer edge of the accretion discs@xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that all of the relevant effects of @xmath6 on the black - hole structure are quite well expressed in the sds spacetimes , since the rotational effects of the black hole spin are concentrated into the region in close vicinity of the black - hole horizon , where the influence of @xmath6 can be abandoned for realistic values of the black hole mass and the relict cosmological constant@xcite .",
    "of course , the efficiency of the accretion processes is controlled by the rotational effects in the innermost parts of the disc , where the kds spacetime structure is relevant@xcite . for near - extreme black holes",
    "the efficiency takes large values @xmath24 as compared with the sds spacetimes where the efficiency @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , in studying the large scale properties of disc structures , investigation of the sds spacetime is quite sufficient , only the accretion efficiency has to be given by the k(ds ) spacetime structure , governing the innermost parts of the disc .",
    "for this reason , it is worth to realize more detailed studies of the disc structures around supermassive black holes reflecting the influence of the repulsive cosmological constant .",
    "there is one especially important problem that could be hardly solved in the framework of full general relativistic approach , namely influence of @xmath6 on the structure of self - graviting disc .",
    "we expect that the pseudo - newtonian approach could be successful . for such purposes ,",
    "we introduce here a pseudo - newtonian potential @xmath26 of the sds spacetimes that could enable us to use directly standard techniques developed in the framework of newtonian physics , e.g. , the newtonian discoseismology@xcite , taking the influence of the repulsive cosmological constant and some relativistic effects into account .",
    "there is a variety of different approaches in defining the pseudo - newtonian gravitational potential describing black holes and various aspects of their spacetime structure@xcite . in the case of schwarzschild spacetimes",
    ", it seems@xcite that to reflect the accretion disc properties , the most convenient is the paczynski - wiita ( p - w ) gravitational potential@xcite @xmath27 .",
    "it enables us to calculate positions of the marginally stable and bound circular orbits at the same radii as follow from the general relativistic calculations .",
    "originally , the p - w potential was introduced by a guess , when attempting to include the schwarzschild radius into the newtonian gravity .",
    "however , there is a simple heuristic method for derivation of the pseudo - newtonian potentials that yields the p - w potential .",
    "the same method was used for the derivation of the pseudo - newtonian gravitational potential for the equatorial plane of kerr spacetimes as well@xcite .",
    "then the position of the marginally stable circular orbit corresponds to the position determined by using the general relativistic approach , and differences in positions of marginally bound circular orbit determined in both the ways are relatively small . in this paper",
    ", this heuristic method is just used for derivation of the pseudo - newtonian gravitational potential for the sds spacetimes .",
    "defining such potential , we have to reflect properly both the gravitational attraction of the black hole and the repulsive effects of the cosmological constant .",
    "the p - w potential , describing with high precision properties of accretion processes in the field of schwarzschild black holes has naturally defined behaviour at infinity . in the sds spacetimes",
    ", we have to find a proper reference point that could in a well defined way serve in a similar sense as infinity in asymptotically flat spacetimes .",
    "it is shown@xcite that such a role could be attributed to the so - called static radius , where the gravitational attraction of black hole acting on matter is exactly balanced by the cosmic repulsion , i.e. , test - particles feel no force , similarly to asymptotic infinity in flat spacetimes .",
    "concentrating on properties of stationary disc configurations in the sds spacetimes , the static radius is appropriately chosen ; we do not consider here properties of the spacetime near the cosmological horizon of the sds spacetimes , nevertheless , the pseudo - newtonian potential we are using here reflects the basic spacetime property near the cosmological horizon , since it diverges there .    in the pseudo - newtonian potential we properly fix position of the marginally stable orbit , marginally bound orbit , the static radius , and we establish the particle energy at these radii in agreement with the exact general relativistic values .",
    "in the standard schwarzschild coordinates @xmath28 , and the geometric system of units @xmath29 , the sds spacetimes are determined by the line element@xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the mass parameter of the spacetimes .",
    "it is useful to introduce the dimensionless parameter @xmath32 and use dimensionless coordinates @xmath33 , @xmath34 , which is equivalent to putting @xmath35 .",
    "singularities of the line element , i.e. , black - hole and cosmological horizons , are given by the relation @xmath36 , thus by solutions of the equation @xmath37 which can be expressed in the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "both the horizons exist for @xmath40 , separating the spacetimes into two dynamic and one static regions . for @xmath41 , both",
    "the horizons coalesce at the radius of the photon circular geodesic at @xmath42 . for @xmath43 ,",
    "the horizons disappear and the sds spacetimes become dynamic naked - singularity spacetimes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .    the heuristic method@xcite enabling us to define the p - w gravitational potential and the pseudo - newtonian gravitational potential for the equatorial plane of the kerr spacetimes",
    "is based on the knowledge of exact general relativistic relations for the angular momentum per particle mass @xmath44 and energy per particle mass @xmath45 of the circular geodesics .",
    "the newtonian gravitational potential @xmath46 for central gravitational fields is related to the newtonian angular momentum per particle mass @xmath47 of the circular orbits by the relation @xmath48 .",
    "the pseudo - newtonian gravitational potential @xmath26 is defined by the newtonian relation with the transposition @xmath49 , plays its role only when the pseudo - newtonian ( e.g , p - w ) gravitational potential is defined . later , standard newtonian quantities in newtonian theory are used along with the pseudo - newtonian gravitational potential . ]",
    "i.e. , by the relation @xmath50 note that the described method of pseudo - newtonian determination works quite well in spherically symmetric ( non - rotating ) spacetimes , or in the equatorial plane of axially symmetric ( rotating , e.g. kerr or kds ) spacetimes .",
    "however , it is much more complicated task to find a pseudo - newtonian potential for the regions outside the equatorial plane of the rotating spacetimes , because of a non - trivial influence of the dragging of inertial frames . there is a need to upgrade this method@xcite or use completely different way of the gravitational potential definition@xcite .    in general relativity ,",
    "the circular orbits in the sds spacetimes correspond to extrema of the effective potential@xcite @xmath51^{1/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] whereas the related constant of motion take the form @xmath52^{1/2}\\left(1-\\frac{3}{r}\\right)^{-1/2},\\\\ \\label{81 } e_{\\rm c}(r;y)&\\equiv&\\left(1-\\frac{2}{r}-yr^2\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{3}{r}\\right)^{-1/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , the gravitational potential ( [ 11 ] ) can be written in the form @xmath53 with an integrating constant @xmath54 .",
    "we calibrate the potential ( [ 82 ] ) by using the condition @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the static radius defined above ; the gravitational force , defined in the general relativistic framework of the optical reference geometry@xcite disappears at @xmath57 .",
    "existence of equilibrium position of free particles with covariant energy representing the rest energy @xmath58 is possible there .",
    "therefore , it is natural to consider the static radius as the starting point , corresponding to infinity in asymptotically flat spacetime .",
    "the proposed pseudo - newtonian gravitational potential ( [ 82 ] ) then takes the form @xmath59 diverges at the radii of horizons and vanishes at the static radius ; for @xmath60 the potential tends asymptotically to zero ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "in the case of central gravitational fields , test - particle motion is confined to central planes and we can choose the equatorial plane for an individual particle . following the newtonian physics , the radial equation of the keplerian equatorial motion",
    "can be written in the form @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the total pseudo - newtonian energy per particle mass ( energy hereafter ) and @xmath63 is the pseudo - newtonian effective potential per particle mass ( effective potential in the following ) defined by the standard relation @xmath64 here , @xmath65 is the pseudo - newtonian gravitational potential ( [ 12 ] ) and @xmath66 is the pseudo - newtonian angular momentum per particle mass ( angular momentum hereafter ) defined in section [ section 2 ] .",
    "the circular keplerian orbits ( geodesics ) correspond to the effective potential extrema ) using relations for orbital and angular velocitites , and for the angular momentum and energy @xmath67 however , in some sense , the method of effective potential@xcite , combining the gravitational potential and potential of centrifugal forces , is more general , illustrative and convenient for our case . ] .",
    "thus , their radii are governed by the function @xmath68 and the corresponding energies ( effective potential extrema ) are governed by the function @xmath69      behaviour of the pseudo - newtonian effective potential @xmath63 qualitatively follows behaviour of its general relativistic counterpart @xmath70 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "we demonstrate this statement by comparing behaviour of the functions @xmath71 and @xmath72 , and their general relativistic counterparts @xmath73 and @xmath45 , defined by relations ( [ 8 ] ) , ( [ 81 ] ) , ( [ 8a ] ) and ( [ 14 ] ) .",
    "the functions @xmath74 and @xmath72 diverge at the radius of the black - hole horizon @xmath75 and vanish at the static radius , while @xmath73 and @xmath45 diverge at the radius of the photon circular orbit , @xmath73 vanishes at the static radius , and @xmath45 does not ( see figs  [ fig:4 ] and [ fig:5 ] ) .    thus , the pseudo - newtonian approach implies that existence of circular orbits is limited by the static radius from above , in accord with the relativistic approach , and by the black - hole horizon from below , in contrast to the relativistic approach , where the lower limit is given by the radius of photon orbit .",
    "this is caused by the fact that we do not obtain the photon circular orbit in the pseudo - newtonian approach .    as well as in the general relativistic approach ,",
    "stable circular orbits , determined by the minima of the effective potential @xmath63 , satisfy the condition @xmath76 .",
    "the unstable circular orbits , determined by the maxima of @xmath63 , satisfy the condition @xmath77 .",
    "inner and outer marginally stable circular orbits correspond to extrema @xmath78 and @xmath79 of the function @xmath71 .",
    "they are governed by the function @xmath80 just as in the general relativistic approach , because loci of extrema of the functions @xmath74 and @xmath73 coincide .",
    "the stable circular orbits are then limited by the condition @xmath81 .",
    "the function @xmath82 vanishes at the radius @xmath83 , corresponding to the marginally stable circular orbit in the schwarzschild spacetime , diverges at @xmath84 and at @xmath85 , and has minimum at @xmath86 , where @xmath87 .",
    "the function is irrelevant at the range @xmath88 , where @xmath89 .",
    "the physically relevant part of @xmath82 is located at @xmath90 .",
    "its maximum is located at @xmath91 and the corresponding maximum is @xmath92 ( see fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "this value represents the limiting value for the sds spacetimes admitting stable geodesics , i.e. , accretion discs@xcite .",
    "behaviour of the effective potential determining the innermost and outermost stable circular orbits is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] .",
    "the marginally bound circular orbits ( inner and outer ) , corresponding to two unstable circular orbits with the same energy and appropriately chosen angular momentum , are determined by the condition @xmath93    the related radii @xmath94 and @xmath95 can be determined by using the following numerical procedure . from equation ( [ 8a ] ) , we express two radii @xmath96 and @xmath97 corresponding to the inner and outer unstable circular orbits ( marginally bound orbits radii candidates ) . taking , moreover , the condition ( [ 17 ] ) into account , i.e. , solving the equation @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is given by relation ( [ 14 ] ) , and considering formula ( [ 17 ] ) once more , we obtain function @xmath100 implicitly determining the radii of the marginally stable orbits @xmath101 and @xmath102 ( see fig .  [ fig:7 ] ) .",

    "for values of the cosmological parameter @xmath12 allowing existence of the stable circular orbits , i.e. , @xmath107 , the functions @xmath108 and @xmath109 have two extrema governed by the function @xmath110 ( see fig .",

    "these extrema correspond to the innermost and outermost stable circular geodesics with @xmath111 and @xmath112 , and @xmath113 and @xmath114 , respectively , which determine extension and accretion efficiency of thin , keplerian discs .",
    "the marginally stable perfect fluid configurations with @xmath115const and @xmath116 are determined by intersections of @xmath117const and @xmath74 curve that determine the center and edges of the fluid configuration@xcite .",
