    "in many dynamical systems noise plays an important role and influences the system s properties and the dynamic behavior in a crucial way .",
    "control of the noise - mediated dynamic properties is a central issue in nonlinear science @xcite .",
    "an often encountered effect of noise is the excitation of irregular stochastic oscillations under conditions where the deterministic system would rest in a stable steady state , e.g. , a stable focus .",
    "the random fluctuations then push the system out of the steady state .",
    "these noise - induced oscillations are a widespread phenomenon and appear , for instance , in lasers @xcite , chemical reaction systems @xcite , semiconductor devices @xcite , neurons @xcite , and many other systems .    in practical applications",
    "the need arises to control the oscillations , for instance , by increasing their coherence and thus the regularity of the oscillations . in recent years",
    "different methods to control stochastic systems have been developed , and applied to noise - induced oscillations in a pendulum with a randomly vibrating suspension axis and external periodic forcing @xcite , stochastic resonance @xcite , noise - induced dynamics in bistable delayed systems @xcite , and self - oscillations in the presence of noise @xcite . in the context of coherence resonance @xcite , time - delayed feedback in the form originally suggested by pyragas to stabilize unstable states in deterministic systems",
    "@xcite has been demonstrated to be a powerful tool to control purely noise - induced oscillations @xcite .",
    "this method couples the difference of the actual state @xmath0 and of a delayed state of the system @xmath1 back into the system.@xmath2 x(t)=f(x(t),t)- k[x(t)-x(t- ) ] .",
    "the time delay @xmath3 and the ( matrix valued ) control amplitude @xmath4 are the control parameters which can be tuned .",
    "while previous studies have shown that the delayed feedback method can control the main frequency and the correlation time @xmath5 and thus the regularity of noise - induced oscillations in simple systems @xcite as well as in spatially extended systems @xcite , and deteriorate or enhance stochastic synchronization of coupled systems @xcite , in this paper we focus on the _ suppression _ of stochastic oscillations . we analyse the mean amplitude ( or , more generally , the covariance ) of the oscillations and show that time - delayed feedback control can decrease the mean oscillation amplitude for appropriately chosen delay time , and thus suppress the oscillations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : generic - model ]",
    "we study a generic model consisting of a damped harmonic oscillator driven by white noise and investigate the influence of delayed feedback . in this generic system",
    "we derive an analytic expression for the mean square oscillation amplitude in dependence on the feedback and show how the oscillations can be suppressed . in section [ sec : laser - model ] we consider a semiconductor laser , a practically relevant example , and show how optical feedback from a fabry - perot resonator , which realizes the delayed - feedback scheme , can suppress noise - induced relaxation oscillations in the laser .",

    "we consider gaussian white noise@xmath11 in our particular system the delay term in eq.([eq : genericmodel ] ) does not induce any local bifurcations in the deterministic system .",
    "thus , the fixed point is stable for all @xmath3 and @xmath4 .    a similar normal form ( without noise )",
    "was previously used to study the stabilization of _ unstable _ deterministic fixed points by time - delayed feedback @xcite , which is possible in the same way as stabilization of unstable deterministic periodic orbits @xcite .",

    "we will calculate the autocorrelation function@xmath29 in an interval @xmath30 $ ] , where the overbar denotes complex conjugate .",
