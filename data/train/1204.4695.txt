    "spin precession due to rashba coupling @xcite in a 2d electron gas ( 2deg ) is a specific manifestation of the fundamental thomas effect of spin precession in magnetic component of electromagnetic field due to spin - orbit interaction .",
    "this relativistic effect is strongly enhanced in semiconductors , and in particular in 2deg in semiconductor heterostructures.@xcite a necessary precondition for the occurrence of thomas  rashba ( tr ) precession in semiconductors is an asymmetry of confinement potential characterized by a vector @xmath0 pointing along the electric field .",
    "an interesting physical situation may show up when the tr precession is noticeable in 2deg in which magnetic impurities are immersed . since electron scattering by magnetic impurities results in the kondo effect",
    ", a natural question is whether and how the kondo scattering is sensitive to the tr spin precession .",
    "prima facie it seems that this precession is irrelevant to the physics of kondo screening . in the presence of spin orbit coupling , the degenerate two level system is composed of spiral states ( kramers pair ) , determined by the spirality winding number ( and not by the spin projection quantum number as in systems respecting spin rotation invariance ) .",
    "but this distinction simply leads to re - scaling of the kondo model s parameters without affecting the kondo physics .",
    "this direct reasoning is supported by basic arguments@xcite stating that , due to time - reversal symmetry , spin - orbit scattering does not suppress the kondo effect even though it breaks spin - rotation invariance .",
    "subsequent investigations@xcite confirmed this conclusion . at finite external magnetic field ,",
    "time reversal invariance is broken , and additional mechanisms affecting kondo tunneling arises together with the conventional zeeman splitting of the impurity levels , as was demonstrated in ref . for the case of dirty metals .",
    "on the other hand , it has been argued@xcite that an admixture of nonzero angular modes of spiral states in a 2deg with tr precession @xcite might cause an enhancement of the kondo temperature due to renormalization of the effective exchange integral .",
    "similar arguments apply for non - centrosymmetruc cubic crystals@xcite .",
    "a special case of kondo effect in the presence of _ local _ rashba coupling in quantum wires has recently been considered , where it is shown@xcite that rashba effect may be the source of resonant states in the bands and thereby induce the kondo effect .",
    "thus , there are cases where rashba - type spin - orbit coupling affects the kondo physics . in that sense",
    "we may refer to it as _ kondo - rashba effect_. + in the present paper we discuss the physical content of the interplay between the tr precession and the kondo effect inherent in quantum dots under the constraint of strong coulomb blockade.@xcite the source of this interlacing may be due both to the sizable rashba - type spin - orbit coupling in the leads and the tr precession in the complex ring - like geometry of the dots.@xcite we stress the specific features of kondo - rashba effect in quantum dot devices in comparison with that resulting from magnetic impurities immersed in 2deg.@xcite as already noted above , the tr precession is relevant for kondo tunneling only under an external magnetic field .",
    "we show here that this relevance stems from the fact that the spin coordinate axes tilt due to the tr precession . the tilting axes for the dot and the leads are distinct , and it is not possible to match two reference frames in the presence of an external magnetic field . as a result of the tr effect ,",
    "the kondo scattering becomes fully anisotropic , and this anisotropy is relevant for the screening mechanism .",
    "in addition , the spatial separation of the kondo impurity ( the localized electron at the dot ) and the leads result in _ non - local _ indirect exchange , and this non - locality is explicitly related to the tr contribution to the indirect exchange .",
    "unremovable mismatch of local magnetic axes is a salient feature of dzyaloshinskii - moriya exchange in some low - symmetry magnetic crystals.@xcite it will be shown that the indirect exchange between spins in the dot and in the leads mediated by rashba coupling has the same vector structure as the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction between adjacent localized spins .",
    "the relevance tr effect to indirect exchange has been perceived in previous studies . in particular , the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yoshida ( rkky ) interaction between localized spins in 2deg with rashba type spin - orbit coupling is characterized by the above mentioned mismatch of local magnetic axes.@xcite .",
    "similar mismatch occurs in devices consisting of qd with rashba interaction in contact with two ferromagnetic leads@xcite and in system consisting of two magnetic impurities in a ring pierced by electric and magnetic fields@xcite .",
    "within the analysis of kondo effect in quantum dot with fixed ( odd ) number of electrons in weak tunneling contact with source and drain leads , the starting point is an effective spin hamiltonian supplemented by tr term ,",
    "@xmath1 the first two terms encode the quantum dot , with electron operators @xmath2 , number operator @xmath3 , discrete electron level @xmath4 and coulomb blockade energy @xmath5 .",
    "the continuum ( band ) states in the leads are characterized by energies @xmath6 and number operators @xmath7 .",
    "assuming the left ( @xmath8 ) and right ( @xmath9 ) leads to be identical , only the even combination @xmath10 survives in the effective hamiltonian .",
    "the next term , @xmath11 , represents an effective cotunneling resulting from the schrieffer - wolff ( sw ) transformation applied on the original anderson hamiltonian .",
    "the last term in ( [ ho ] ) stands for the tr precession .    in order to expose the key features of the interplay between tr precession and kondo tunneling and to elucidate the triggering role of magnetic field ,",
    "we first adopt a phenomenological approach .",
    "consider a model where both the leads and the dot are subject to tr precession .",
    "each subsystem @xmath12 ( for lead ) , @xmath13 ( for dot ) is characterized by its own tr coupling with a rashba vector @xmath14 and coupling strength @xmath15 .",
    "( the microscopic substantiation for this model will be presented at the end of this section ) .",

    "the tr coupling is given by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are tr coupling constants and momentum operators for dot and lead subsystems .",

    "@xmath29 are also different in magnitude and sometimes they even have opposite signs , so we retain the index @xmath30 in the zeeman terms as well .",
    "it is seen from eq .",
    "( [ hg ] ) , that the spin precession described by @xmath31 results in rotation of spin axes established by the zeeman term @xmath18 , but the rotation angles are _ different _ for dot and lead subsystems , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is an appropriate rotation matrix ( see below ) . in the simplest case",
    "where both rashba vectors are parallel to the @xmath27-axis but the coupling constants are different in magnitude , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , the dot hamiltonian @xmath36 is transformed to a new spin frame by means of the rotation matrix , @xmath37 the euler angles are given by the equations @xmath38 thus , the quantities @xmath39 and @xmath40 define the modulus of a planar component of an effective magnetic field @xmath41 .",
