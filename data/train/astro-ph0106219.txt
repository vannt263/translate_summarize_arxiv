    "2001 ) imaging surveys are therefore finding nearly all the hard x - ray sources , and the analysis of these surveys will provide a comprehensive understanding of the nature of the sources that comprise the xrb at these energies .",
    "the excellent @xmath13 x - ray positional accuracy of _ chandra _ permits the secure identification of the optical counterparts to the x - ray sources .",
    "one of the most interesting results obtained from optical follow - up observations is that almost half of the hard x - ray light arises in optically bright galaxies ( @xmath14 ) in the @xmath15 redshift range .",
    "the other half arises in a mixture of higher redshift agn and optically faint galaxies ( @xmath16 ) , many of whose redshifts likely lie in the range @xmath17 to 3 , based on their colors ( crawford et al .  2001 ; barger et al .  2001a ; cowie et al .  2001 ) .",
    "almost all of the optically bright sources can be spectroscopically identified , and most are bulge - dominated galaxies with near-@xmath18 luminosities .",
    "contrary to the situation for the faint _ rosat _ soft x - ray sources ( schmidt et al .",
    "1998 ) , the vast majority ( @xmath19% ) do not have broad optical or ultraviolet lines , and about half of the optically identified sources show no obvious high ionization signatures of agn activity .",
    "chandra _ hard x - ray sources prior to the 1  ms data are generally too faint to allow the multiparameter fits to the x - ray spectra that would directly measure the intrinsic column densities . however , the soft to hard x - ray flux ratios suggest that the sources are highly absorbed systems whose high column densities could effectively extinguish the optical , ultraviolet , and near - infrared continua from the agn and render traditional identification techniques ineffective",
    ".    one of the most exciting avenues in the study of the hard x - ray source populations is determining the times and duration of distant supermassive black hole activity .",
    "barger et al .  ( 2001a ) found that about 7% of optically luminous galaxies are x - ray active at any time . a similar active fraction ( 6% )",
    "was later found by hornschemeier et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for the 225  ks _ chandra _ deep field - north ( cdf - n ) data .",
    "thus , these studies suggest that , on average , accretion activity lasts for on order of half a gyr over the lifetime of a galaxy .",
    "in this paper we present a multiwavelength study of the hard x - ray sources detected in the field containing the @xmath20 massive lensing cluster a370 ( bautz et al .",
    "2000 ) , the ssa13 field ( mushotzky et al .",

    "the remaining 13 hard x - ray sources are not strongly affected either by the cluster lens ( amplifications between 1 and 1.3 ) or by the diffuse emission from the cluster . in the following analysis",
    "we take into account the two large amplifications but neglect the smaller amplifications , treating the remaining objects as a field sample .    when we combine the a370 data with the ssa13 and cdf - n data , we obtain a sample of 69 hard x - ray selected sources with extremely deep 20  cm and optical imaging data .",
    "we have spectroscopic redshifts for 45 of the 69 sources .",
    "we use our combined sample to determine the optical properties of the x - ray sources that comprise the hard xrb , the duty cycle of x - ray activity , and the luminosities associated with agn accretion .",
    "we then evaluate the mass inflow rate onto the supermassive black holes and deduce the time history of the accretion rate density .",

    "it is not entirely known what mechanism produces the relationship . in galaxies without a powerful agn , the radio luminosity is dominated by diffuse synchrotron emission ; thus , the tight empirical correlation is thought to be a consequence of the radio continuum emission and the thermal dust emission both being linearly related to the massive star formation rate . in the present systems",
    "a substantial fraction of the fir luminosity may also be of agn origin rather than from star formation , but the only strong statement that we can make is that the fir luminosity from the agn is bounded above by the fir - radio correlation result from  6.3 of b01 ,    @xmath105    here @xmath101 is in cm and @xmath106 has units erg  @xmath11  s@xmath5  hz@xmath5 .",

    "the mass inflow rate into a black hole , @xmath111 or @xmath112 , is related to the agn s bolometric luminosity by @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the radiative efficiency of the accretion energy . with @xmath112 in units of @xmath115  gyr@xmath5 , the relation is    @xmath116    where @xmath117 is in units of erg  s@xmath5 .    if we make the simplifying assumption that @xmath114 has an approximately universal value , @xmath9 , we can evaluate @xmath112 for our hard x - ray sources .",

    "the lower envelope of the @xmath112 versus redshift plot simply reflects selection bias , since high redshift sources with low @xmath112 will not be detected in the current hard x - ray surveys .",
    "the upper envelope of the distribution strongly reflects the changing strength of the maximal accretion rate with redshift , although some of the change is due to the volume increase with redshift , which gives a higher chance of finding very luminous sources ( @xmath123 for a @xmath124 bin is a factor @xmath125 larger than for a @xmath84 bin ) . at @xmath126",

    "accretion activity might occur over this long a period in all galaxies , or some galaxies might be active for much longer periods while others are completely inactive .",
