    "gamma - ray bursts are widely believed to be cosmological , but no direct measurement of distance exists to confirm this belief .",
    "no gamma - ray burst has lines that can be associated with atomic or nuclear processes , so a direct calculation of their redshifts is not possible . with only one recent exception ( groot  1997 ) , no gamma - ray burst has an observed counterpart , so an indirect calculation of their redshifts is also not possible . because of these difficulties , a number of researchers have attempted to derive average redshifts by studying the properties of gamma - ray burst catalogs .",
    "the simplest of these studies fit the peak - flux distribution to cosmological models under various assumptions ( e.g. fenimore  1993 ; wickramasinghe  1993 ; emslie & horack 1994 ; cohen & piran 1995 ; pendleton  1996 ; petrosian & lee 1997 ) .",
    "more involved studies attempt to measure a correlation of gamma - ray burst timescale with photon flux under the assumption that such a correlation is evidence of a cosmological time dilation ( norris  1994 ; davis  1994 ; mitrofanov  1994 , 1996 lee & petrosian 1996 ) . related studies attempt to measure a correlation of the characteristic photon energy with flux , which may indicate a cosmological redshift ( nemiroff  1994 ; mallozzi  1995 ) .",
    "the difficulty with these approaches is that the interpretation of the results is not unique .",
    "the observed flux distribution simply shows that gamma - ray bursts are not homogeneously distributed in space , which is unique neither to a cosmological origin nor to a particular model of cosmological expansion . galactic corona models of gamma - ray bursts easily reproduce the observations ( brainerd 1992 ; ulmer & wijers 1995 ; ulmer  1995 ; hakkila  1995 ) , and any cosmological model can be made to conform to the observations with the proper choice of density evolution ( rutledge  1995 ; horack  1995 ; reichart & mszros 1997 ) , or luminosity distribution ( mszros & mszros 1995 ; hakkila  1996 ) , as is evident from the numerous combinations of assumptions made by the numerous papers examining this topic .",
    "the effects sought in correlation studies can be explained by an intrinsic correlation of the parameter of interest with the luminosity ( brainerd 1994a ) .",
    "the beaming of relativistic jets ( brainerd 1994a ; yi 1994 ) and the conservation of total energy in monoenergetic sources ( wijers & paczyski 1994 ) are examples of mechanisms that produce such a correlation .",
    "the question addressed in this article is whether a strong correlation of the burst time scale or the characteristic spectral energy with peak flux can have a purely cosmological origin when the gamma - ray burst peak - flux distribution is determined by the luminosity distribution rather than by the spatial distribution . in this study ,",
    "i use a luminosity function that is a power law with an upper limit , and , for comparison , a monoluminous distribution . the spectral model",
    "i use (  2 ) is the compton attenuation model ( brainerd 1994b ) , which accurately represents the observed spectra . the cosmological expansion with a @xmath6 comoving source density ( @xmath7 ) defines a limiting power - law index for the peak flux distribution that is @xmath8 as the peak flux goes to zero ; a luminosity distribution can drive this index closer to @xmath9 (  3 and  4 ) . when the luminosity function determines the asymptotic behavior of the peak flux distribution ,",
    "the density evolution of the gamma - ray burst sources has only a weak effect on the average time - dilation and redshift (  3 ) .",
    "i find (  5 ) that a broad luminosity distribution in a friedmann cosmology with a constant comoving source density produces peak - flux distributions that fit well the distribution observed by the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on the compton gamma - ray observatory . at a given flux , the gamma - ray bursts have a redshift distribution , with the average redshift considerably smaller than the maximum redshift (  4 ) .",
    "the maximum redshift a burst can have at the batse threshold is @xmath3 . in this model",
    ", the cosmological expansion can not explain the reported correlations (  6 ) , so an intrinsic correlation must exist .",
    "the flux distribution for gamma - ray bursts selected by hardness ratio presented in recent studies is a measure of this intrinsic correlation (  7 ) .",
    "these studies offer the opportunity to separate the cosmological effects from the intrinsic correlations .",
    "gamma - ray burst spectra are not power - law spectra ; they are hard spectra that gradually roll over in the @xmath10 to @xmath11 energy band to a power law , with the power - law behavior appearing above @xmath12 ( metzger  1974 ; hueter 1984 ; matz 1985 ) .",
    "the choice of spectral model influences the shape of the burst peak - flux distribution ( brainerd 1994b ; mallozzi  1996 ) . a physical spectral model that accurately describes gamma - ray burst spectra is a compton - attenuated power - law spectrum ( brainerd 1994b ; brainerd  1996a , b ) .",

    "a necessary and sufficient condition for the integral over equation ( 8) to be bounded under these assumptions is that @xmath74 , which guarantees the convergence of the integral as @xmath73 , and @xmath95 , which guarantees convergence as @xmath77 .",
    "because @xmath78 is already required for convergence in the regime of @xmath96 , this last criterion is satisfied when @xmath97 . because @xmath90 , the right side of this inequality is @xmath98 , so this second condition on @xmath99 is only important for very strong evolution .",
    "i assume that this limit on @xmath100 holds in the discussion below .    when @xmath88 for @xmath80 , the integral can be divided into four parts that are bounded by @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 . when the integral peaks at a value @xmath104 that is either of these first two values , the factor of @xmath57 in the argument of the luminosity function can be factored out of the integral .",

    "the last condition guarantees that the integration does not have secondary maximum at @xmath101 . because i assume @xmath90 and @xmath7 , this last condition is always satisfied . as a consequence ,",
    "the second condition on @xmath116 is the stronger , and the general asymptotic solution can be written as @xmath126 where @xmath127    several points are immediately clear from these equations .",
    "first , the behavior of the luminosity distribution function below @xmath71 influences the asymptotic behavior of the flux distribution , while the behavior above @xmath71 is unimportant .",
    "recall that @xmath71 is defined as the maximum of @xmath128 .",
    "second , in the absence of strong source evolution , a large asymptotic power - law index at small @xmath57 requires a luminosity distribution with a power - law index of equal value , as noted by mszros & mszros ( 1995 ) . because @xmath90 , the minimum value of @xmath129 , which is given by the second term in equation ( 12 ) , is @xmath130 for @xmath131 ; from the second term of equation ( 16 ) , the minimum value of @xmath132 is @xmath133 for @xmath131 .",
    "third , because the luminosity function can formally diverge and still give a bounded integral as long as it falls below a @xmath134 power law as @xmath67 , the presence of a change in the luminosity distribution function at sufficiently low luminosity  which is required by the boundedness of @xmath135has no effect on the observed flux distribution ; formally , this must be at @xmath136 , where @xmath137 is the minimum observable burst flux ( mszros & mszros 1995 ) . finally ,",
    "evolution is unimportant in the asymptotic behavior unless the number of bursts increases dramatically as @xmath138 increases ; the second index in equation ( 12 ) increases by @xmath139 , and the second index in equation ( 16 ) increases by @xmath140 , so evolution can not dominate the luminosity distribution function unless @xmath141 .    equations ( 12 ) and ( 16 ) imply different behaviors for @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "for @xmath142 , the only relevant limit is that given by equation ( 16 ) .",
    "when @xmath96 , the integrand rises with @xmath22 until the peak in @xmath144 is reached .",
    "when @xmath145 , the integrand rises until @xmath83 ; then , if @xmath146 , the integrand goes to zero more rapidly than @xmath147 as @xmath148 , but if the inequality is violated , the integrand either rises or goes to zero less rapidly than @xmath147 .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath143 , there are three regimes to consider . as in the previous case , when @xmath149 , the integrand rises to the maximum of @xmath144 , but for @xmath107 , equation ( 12 ) applies , and the integrand goes to zero more rapidly than @xmath147 when @xmath150 , and rises or goes to zero less rapidly than @xmath147 when the inequality does not hold . when @xmath108 , equation ( 16 ) holds , and the behavior noted for @xmath142 holds for @xmath143 .",
    "the consequences of this behavior are that the minimum value of @xmath151 in an @xmath152 asymptotic description of the flux distribution is strongly dependent on @xmath153 and that , for @xmath143 , the distribution in @xmath22 for bursts with a given @xmath57 is broad and flat over @xmath107 when @xmath154 .",
    "the gamma - ray burst flux distribution is derived for two luminosity distributions : a monoluminous distribution function , and a power - law luminosity distribution with a high luminosity cutoff . the first is widely used , and it is given here for comparison to the power law distribution .      the equation for a monoluminous gamma - ray burst distribution does not have an integral over @xmath22 .",

    "there are 396 gamma - ray bursts that meet these criteria .",
    "the upper threshold is for computational convenience , and it has no effect on the model fits . the lower threshold is to avoid the effects of the variable detector threshold and the detector geometry .",
    "the batse instrument triggers on a gamma - ray burst if the count rate exceeds a threshold count rate in at least two detectors .",
    "this count rate is set by integrating the background for @xmath207 intervals and calculating from this the standard deviation for counts on each of the three timescales given above .",
    "the trigger threshold is a multiple of this standard deviation ; usually 5.5 standard deviations is chosen . because the background fluctuates by a factor of 2 over the 90 minute orbit , the trigger threshold is variable . because the trigger is in counts rather than in flux , because the detector geometry is an octahedron , and because earth scatters burst radiation to the experiment , the flux threshold is angle dependent .",
    "these various effects cause an undercounting of gamma - ray bursts of low flux .",
    "the choice of @xmath208 on the @xmath203 timescale as a lower limit overcomes these difficulties ( pendleton  1996 ) .    for 90 minutes after a trigger ,",
    "the threshold is raised so that if a particularly bright burst occurs , it is observed by the instrument .",
    "such bursts , which are called overwrites , must be dropped from the sample , because they represent an overcounting of bright bursts relative to dim bursts .",
    "the choice of timescales affects the choice of cosmological model .",
    "the reason is that if the burst pulse carrying the peak flux is fully resolved in time , then the cosmological redshift comes into the peak flux through the lorentz boost of the flux , but if the pulse is much shorter than the instrument timescale , all photons in the pulse arrive inside that timescale regardless of time dilation .",
    "the time dilation of the emission therefore drops out of the problem , and the peak - flux has one more factor of @xmath209 than it does for the time - resolved pulse .",
    "i desire a timescale that resolves the time - behavior of most gamma - ray bursts without introducing large errors in the flux measurement from counting statistics .",
    "i compare in figure  5 the peak fluxes of the 396 bursts in my sample .",
    "if two time scales each resolve the time - dependent variation of the flux , the peak flux measured on each should be equal within counting statistics . in figure  5a , each burst is plotted on the @xmath203@xmath204 timescale plane , and in figure  5b , each is plotted on the @xmath202@xmath203 plane .",
    "the upper diagonal line represents equal fluxes on both timescales , which occurs when a pulse is fully time resolved .",
    "the lower diagonal line represents the short timescale having a peak flux that is 4 times the peak flux for the long timescale , which is what occurs when the pulse is much shorter than the short timescale .",
    "one sees that the clustering along the line of equality is stronger for figure  5b than for figure  5a , showing that the @xmath203 timescale resolves most burst while the @xmath204 timescale leaves a large fraction of bursts unresolved .",
    "the percentage of bursts in figure  5a that have a @xmath203 peak flux that is more than a factor of 2 larger than the @xmath204 peak flux is 2.6% , while the percentage in figure  5b that have a @xmath202 peak flux that is more than a factor of 2 larger than the @xmath203 peak flux is 0.7% . for a factor of @xmath210 ,",

    "the upper diagonal line on each plot gives flux equality , while the lower diagonal on each gives a ratio of 1 to 4 in the two peak fluxes .",
    "some bursts have durations that are of order the sampling timescale . for these bursts ,",
    "the time structure can not be resolved , so a lower limit on the gamma - ray burst duration is warranted .",
    "the duration distribution is bimodal , with a local minimum at @xmath212 .",

    "second , the gamma - ray burst characteristics must be independent of @xmath40 , particularly for @xmath79 .",
    "these assumptions are reasonable given that the observed flux distribution goes to a power - law of index @xmath9 for large flux , which is a natural consequence of these assumptions .",
    "the discussion in  3 and  4 shows that the power - law index of the flux distribution deviates from @xmath9 at @xmath180 .",
    "this flux is dependent on the spectral parameters through @xmath336 in the @xmath23 argument of @xmath337 , but this dependence is weak , as demonstrated by the values for @xmath180 derived from model fits and given in tables 3 and  4 . if there is a strong dependence of @xmath180 on spectral parameter , it can only enter through the direct dependence of the distribution function @xmath338 on the spectral parameter @xmath42 . in this case",
    ", @xmath71 is a function of @xmath42 , which makes @xmath180 a function of @xmath42 through equation  ( 6 ) .",
    "to    the dependence of @xmath180 on @xmath23 is graphically demonstrated in figure  11 , where @xmath5 is plotted as a function of flux for specific values of @xmath23 and @xmath25 , where @xmath25 is the value of @xmath5 when @xmath339 .",
    "the solid curves give the variation of @xmath5 with @xmath57 when @xmath25 decreases with @xmath23 , the dotted curves give @xmath5 for different values of @xmath23 and the same @xmath25 , and the dashed curves give @xmath5 for different values of @xmath25 and the same @xmath23 . in these curves , @xmath79 when @xmath5 is constant with @xmath57 , so the flux distribution for a given @xmath5 is a power law of index @xmath9 .",
    "regarding these sets of curves as three models of the dependence of @xmath71 on @xmath25 , one sees that when @xmath25 decreases with @xmath71 , the value of @xmath180 for bursts selected by @xmath5 decreases with @xmath25 . the solid curves exhibit a second property not yet touched upon  the crossing of curves .",
    "this means that bursts with a given @xmath57 and @xmath5 can have a variety of values for @xmath23 and @xmath22 .    for the spectral model in  2 , the selection of bursts by @xmath5 is equivalent to turning the spectral parameter @xmath24 into a function of @xmath25 and @xmath22 .",
    "equation ( 8) becomes @xmath340 \\ ,      & \\phi\\left\\ { { f \\over { \\cal f}\\left ( z \\right ) } ,      \\psi\\left [ e_{peak } \\left ( 1 + z \\right ) , \\tau_t \\right ] \\right\\ }     \\ , { \\cal f}\\left ( z \\right)^{-1 } \\nonumber \\\\     & \\cdot { r^2 \\over \\left ( 1 + z \\right ) \\ , \\sqrt { 1 + 2 q_0 z } }      \\left| { d \\psi\\left(e_p\\right )      \\over d e_p } \\right|_{e_{peak}\\left ( 1 + z \\right ) }     \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the function @xmath341 is given by @xmath342 , where @xmath343 is the klein - nishina cross section and the prime represents the first derivative with respect to @xmath344 . for @xmath345 , @xmath346      m c^2/e_p$ ] , so the first derivative of @xmath341 is @xmath347 m c^2/e_p^2 $ ] .",
    "therefore , the derivative term does not dramatically change the dependence of equation ( 22 ) on @xmath22 from that in equation  ( 8) .",
    "the important difference from equation ( 8) is the dependence of @xmath348 on @xmath349 in equation ( 22 ) .",
    "the observed distribution of @xmath5 in the batse catalog falls rapidly to zero for @xmath350 ( mallozzi  1995 ) .",
    "because the @xmath5 distribution is narrow , @xmath351 must fall rapidly as @xmath25 goes to infinity .",
    "this means that an additional upper limit on the value of @xmath22 is set by the value of @xmath349 at which the integrand no longer contributes significantly to the integral .",
    "when the integrand peak occurs at @xmath96 , the maximum value of @xmath22 is set by the dependence of @xmath348 on @xmath23 , but when the peak occurs at @xmath145 , the maximum value of @xmath22 is set by the dependence on @xmath25 . in the second case , the upper limit on @xmath22 is independent of @xmath57 .",
    "this limit sets an upper limit on @xmath23 through the ratio @xmath352 ; as @xmath57 decreases , the upper limit on @xmath23 decreases .",
    "these results explain the results of recent studies ( pizzichini 1994 ; belli 1995 ; kouveliotou  1996 ; pendleton  1997 ) of the batse flux distribution for gamma - ray bursts selected by hardness ratio .",
    "the hardness ratio is a measure of the spectral shape , and it is dependent on the cosmological redshift because of the curvature in gamma - ray burst spectra below @xmath12 .",
    "it is therefore a proxy measure of @xmath5 .",
    "these studies show that the soft gamma - ray bursts have a flux distribution that is a power law of index @xmath9 .",
    "the hard gamma - ray bursts , however , follow a curve that falls below a @xmath9 power law .",
    "this is the behavior expected when @xmath25 rises with luminosity .",
    "the study of the burst distribution on the @xmath5@xmath87 plane may yield the luminosity distribution of gamma - ray bursts as a function of @xmath25 .",
    "this would enable one to separate the intrinsic correlation of @xmath25 with luminosity from the cosmological redshift .",
    "the way one approaches this problem is to select the group of burst with the highest value of @xmath5 .",
    "as one goes to lower flux for such bursts , the brighter bursts redshifted out of the @xmath5 range being examined , and no bursts enter this band through a redshift from a higher value of @xmath5 . as a consequence ,",
    "the peak - flux distribution deviates from the @xmath9 power law in a manner determined by the luminosity distribution function for @xmath353 , and a luminosity distribution function for this value of @xmath25 can be derived .",
    "one can then subtract from the density of bursts with smaller values of @xmath5 the density of bursts with large values of @xmath25 that are strongly redshifted .",
    "one then selects bursts with a lower value of @xmath5 to repeat the process .",
    "the uncertainty in the feasibility of this analysis is in whether the batse data set is of sufficient size and quality to perform such a test .",
    "a monoluminous burst distribution produces good fits to the batse peak - flux distribution for very specific spectral parameters .",
    "the parameters that produce the best values of @xmath201 are themselves strongly dependent on the value of  @xmath153 .",
    "the spectra that are nearly power laws do not produce good fits : a curved spectrum is required to reproduce the observations .",
    "the spectral parameters derived from fits to gamma - ray burst spectra produce peak - flux distributions that fit the observed distribution well . from model",
    "fits to the peak - flux distribution , one finds that gamma - ray bursts at @xmath101 have peak fluxes of @xmath354@xmath238 for @xmath142 and @xmath355@xmath239 for @xmath167 .",
    "i confirm the conclusion that the @xmath142 cosmology can not simultaneously reproduce the observed flux distribution and the reported time dilation  burst flux correlations ( fenimore & bloom 1995 ) , and i find that the @xmath143 cosmology can never reproduce the observed time dilation  burst flux correlation , independent of the fit to the peak flux distribution .",
    "when gamma - ray bursts have a distribution of luminosities , the shape of the low end of the peak - flux distribution can be determined by the shape of the luminosity distribution ( mszros & mszros 1995 ) .",
    "if the luminosity distribution below some value is proportional to @xmath356 , then the asymptotic flux distribution as @xmath193 is @xmath357 when @xmath358 for @xmath142 and @xmath359 for @xmath167 when there is only mild source density evolution .",
    "the precise values on the right side of these inequalities are dependent on the burst spectrum and the density evolution of burst sources .",
    "when the inequalities are violated , the peak - flux distribution is that found for monoluminous models .",
    "equations ( 12 ) and ( 16 ) give these limits and their dependence on source density evolution .",
    "the luminosity distribution can formally diverge as the luminosity goes to 0 ; below a critical luminosity , which is set by the peak - flux threshold of the observing instrument , the luminosity distribution no longer contributes to the peak - flux distribution .",
    "a power - law luminosity distribution @xmath1 with an upper cutoff at @xmath71 produces peak - flux distributions that fit the batse 3b data well for most spectral parameters .",
    "one finds that @xmath360 .",
    "this shows that the luminosity distribution need not be a standard candle or a steep power law to produce a good fit to the data .    when the power - law luminosity distribution defines the shape of the flux distribution , so that @xmath360 , the gamma - ray bursts at a given peak flux have a distribution of redshifts that is strongly peaked at @xmath252 .",
    "as @xmath189 becomes smaller , the peak in the @xmath22 distribution goes to infinity , and the distribution rises monotonically .",
    "the distribution goes to zero at some maximum value for @xmath22 that is set by the peak flux . when @xmath360 , the average redshift is a weak function of peak flux when the peak flux is small . at the peak - flux threshold of batse ,",
    "the maximum redshift that a burst can have is @xmath3 , while the average redshift at threshold is @xmath4 . from the model",
    "fits to the peak flux distribution , the distribution in @xmath22 has an upper limit of @xmath101 when @xmath361 , although this limit on @xmath180 is poorly constrained .",
    "this implies that the most luminous gamma - ray bursts have an isotropic luminosity of @xmath362 in the @xmath10 to @xmath11 energy band for @xmath248 . for a burst duration of @xmath363 ,",
    "the fluence is @xmath364 , making solar mass objects implausible sources of gamma - ray bursts .    a distinction in the literature is often made between narrow and broad luminosity distributions . by narrow , many authors mean either that the bursts are nearly monoluminous , which is a statement about the burst physics , or that a high percentage of observed bursts have nearly the same flux , which is a statement about the detector threshold .",
    "a more useful distinction is between luminosity - dominated flux distributions and density - dominated flux distributions . in the former",
    ", the shape of the flux distribution is determined by the shape of the luminosity distribution , and the average redshift , which is weakly dependent on peak flux , is @xmath354 . in the latter ,",
    "the shape of the peak - flux distribution is determined by the spatial distribution of gamma - ray bursts , and there is nearly a one - to - one correspondence between redshift and peak flux .",
    "the large errors in the model parameters do not strongly constrain the distribution in @xmath22 at a given peak flux .",
    "because of this , large values of @xmath22 found from model fits of the compton attenuation spectrum to batse gamma - ray bursts are consistent with the values of @xmath22 possible in the flux distribution produced by a cosmological model with a luminosity distribution function .    because one averages over the distribution in @xmath22 when calculating the average burst duration and the characteristic photon energy at a given peak flux , the average time dilation factor does not equal the average redshift factor ; the former is larger than the latter . from the model",
    "fits to the observed peak - flux distribution , one expects bursts with two different values of peak flux , one 10 times the other , to have ratios of average time dilations and ratios of average spectral redshifts of @xmath365 .",
    "independent of the best fit to the flux distribution , the maximum possible time dilation and redshift ratios are @xmath366 .",
    "the reported correlations of @xmath5 and burst time scale with peak flux are much larger than this by 1.5 to 2 standard deviations , so they are not consequences of cosmological expansion in the models examined above . within this model , only the addition of an intrinsic correlation with luminosity can create the observed correlations .",
    "an alternative not explored in this article is strong source evolution , with @xmath367 ( reichart & mszros 1997 ) . from equations @xmath368 and @xmath369 ,",
    "the flux distribution in this case is density - dominated . on the other hand , since cosmological expansion produces a modest effect when a luminosity distribution determines the peak flux distribution , the absence of a correlation can not be take as evidence that gamma - ray bursts are not cosmological .",
    "the presence of an intrinsic correlation of @xmath5 with flux may be tested by examining the flux distribution for bursts with different values of @xmath5 , the energy at which the @xmath328 curve has a maximum .",
    "if the intrinsic value of @xmath5 decreases with luminosity , then the bursts with the smallest observed values of @xmath5 will have a peak - flux distribution that falls away from a @xmath9 power law at a lower value of @xmath57 than do the bursts with a high value of @xmath5 .",
    "this is observed when gamma - ray bursts are selected by hardness ratio , which is a proxy for  @xmath5 .",
    "one justification given for more sensitive gamma - ray burst detectors is the measurement of the gamma - ray burst flux distribution at fluxes below the thresholds of current gamma - ray experiments .",
    "if gamma - ray bursts are at cosmological redshifts of @xmath83 , then such an effort is of limited value , because the behavior of the distribution is strongly model dependent , and is easily modeled by a luminosity distribution function . of more value",
    "are large numbers of gamma - ray bursts with well characterized spectra .",
    "such burst catalogs allow one to discern the dependence of burst luminosity on spectral parameters , which then allows one to disentangle the intrinsic correlation of burst luminosity with @xmath5 from the correlation from the cosmological expansion .",
    "it is this that justifies accumulating as large a data set as possible , and underlies the value of continued observations by the batse .",
