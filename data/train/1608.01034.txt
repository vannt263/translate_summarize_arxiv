    "<S> due to off - center relativistic motion of the charged spectators and the local momentum - imbalance of the participants , a short - lived huge magnetic field is likely generated , especially in relativistic heavy - ion collisions . in determining the temperature dependence of bulk and shear viscosities of the qcd matter in vanishing and finite magnetic field , </S>",

    "<S> we find that both approaches have almost identical results , especially in the hadron phase . </S>",
    "<S> in the temperature dependence of bulk and shear viscosities relative to thermal entropy at the critical temperature , there is a rapid decrease in the chiral phase - transition and in the critical temperature with increasing magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> as the magnetic field strength increases , a peak appears at the critical temperature ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this can be understood from the small drop on the thermal entropy at @xmath1 , which can be interpreted due to instability in the hydrodynamic flow of the quark - gluon plasma and soft statistical hadronization . </S>",
