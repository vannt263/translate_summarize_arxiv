    "many social , biological , and information systems can be well described by networks , where nodes represent individuals and links denote the relations or interactions between nodes .",
    "the study of complex networks has therefore become a common focus of many branches of science .",
    "a fundamental tool for network analysis is the so - called _ link prediction _ , which attempts to estimate the likelihood of the existence of a link between two nodes , based on observed links and the attributes of nodes @xcite .    in many biological networks , such as food webs ,",
    "protein - protein interaction networks and metabolic networks , whether a link between two nodes exists must be demonstrated by field and/or laboratory experiments , which are usually very costly .",
    "our knowledge of these networks is very limited , for example , 80% of the molecular interactions in cells of yeast @xcite and 99.7% of human @xcite are still unknown . instead of blindly checking all possible interactions , to predict based on known interactions and focus on those links most likely to exist can sharply reduce the experimental costs if the predictions are accurate enough . social network analysis",
    "also comes up against the missing data problem @xcite , where link prediction algorithms may play a role .",
    "in addition , the data in constructing biological and social networks may contain inaccurate information , resulting in spurious links @xcite .",
    "link prediction algorithms can be applied to identify these spurious links @xcite . besides helping in analyzing networks with missing data , the link prediction algorithms",
    "can be used to predict the links that may appear in the future of evolving networks . for example , in online social networks , very likely but not yet existent links can be recommended as promising friendships , which can help users in finding new friends and thus enhance their loyalties to the web sites .",
    "other applications of link prediction include the evaluation of network evolving models @xcite , the classification of partially labeled networks @xcite , and so on ( see the review article @xcite for the detailed discussion on real applications ) .    to evaluate the algorithmic performance , the data set is divided into two parts : the training set is treated as known information while the probe set is used to estimate the prediction accuracy . to our knowledge ,",
    "the datasets are always divided completely randomly .",
    "this is of course the most straightforward way , and it seems a very fair method without any statistical bias .",
    "however , this straightforward and standard method may lead to terrible bias , since in real biological and information networks , missing links are more likely to be links connecting low - degree nodes .",
    "for example , the known structure of the world wide web is just a sampling , where the hyperlinks from popular web pages have higher probability to be uncovered .",
    "in contrast , hyperlinks from unbeknown web pages are probably lost",
    ". actually , in common sense , interaction between two significant proteins , hyperlink between two well - known web pages and relationship between two famous persons are of less probability to be missed .",
    "accordingly , in this article , we study how to uncover missing links with low - degree nodes .",
    "that is to say , we divide the data set into two parts and make the links in the probe set less popular ( i.e. , of less degree products ) than the links in the training set .",
    "experimental analysis on ten local similarity indices and four disparate real networks reveals a surprising result that the leicht - holme - newman ( lhn ) index @xcite performs the best , although it was known to be one of the worst indices if the probe set is a random sampling of all links @xcite .",
    "we further propose an parameter - dependent index , which considerably improves the prediction accuracy .",
    "finally , we show the relevance of the proposed index on three real sampling methods .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we will clearly define the problem of link prediction , describe the standard process to evaluate the prediction accuracy , introduce the state - of - the - art local indices for node similarity and how to sample less popular links for the probe set .",
    "experimental results for the traditional sampling method and the proposed method are presented in section iii . in section iv",
    ", we will propose an improved index which performs even better than the lhn index . in section",
    "v , we will introduce three mainstream sampling methods , and test the improved index on the corresponding sampled networks .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in section vi .",
    "given an undirected network @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the sets of nodes and links respectively .",
    "the multiple links and self - connections are not allowed .",
    "denote by @xmath3 the universal set containing all @xmath4 possible links , where @xmath5 denotes the number of elements in set @xmath1 .",
    "then , the set of nonexistent links is @xmath6 , in which there are some missing links , namely the existed yet unknown links or those that will form in the future .",
    "the task of link prediction is to uncover these links .",
    "each node pair @xmath7 and @xmath8 will be assigned a score @xmath9 according to a given prediction algorithm .",
    "the higher score , the higher probability that this link exists .",
    "the score matrix @xmath10 is symmetry for @xmath11 is undirected .",
    "all the nonexistent links are sorted in descending order according to their scores , and the top - ranked links are most likely to exist .    to test the algorithmic accuracy ,",
    "the observed links @xmath2 are divided into two groups : the training set @xmath12 is treated as known information , while the probe set @xmath13 is used for testing and no information therein is allowed to be used for prediction .",
    "clearly , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the accuracy of prediction is quantified by a standard metric called auc ( short for _ area under the receiver operating characteristic curve _ ) @xcite .",
    "specifically , this metric can be interpreted as the probability that a randomly chosen missing link ( links in @xmath13 ) has higher score than a randomly chosen nonexistent link ( links in @xmath6 ) . in the implementation , among @xmath16 times of independent comparisons , if there are @xmath17 times that the missing link has higher score and @xmath18 times the missing link and nonexistent link have the same score , auc is calculated by @xmath19 .",
    "if all the scores are generated from an independent and identical distribution , the accuracy should be about 0.5 .",
    "therefore , the degree to which the accuracy exceeds 0.5 indicates how much better the algorithm performs than pure chance .",
    "the simplest framework of link prediction is the similarity - based algorithm , where each pair of nodes , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , is assigned a score @xmath9 , which is directly defined as the similarity between them @xcite .",
    "all non - observed links are ranked according to their scores , and the links connecting more similar nodes are supposed to be of higher existence likelihoods . owning to its simplicity , the study on similarity - based algorithms is the mainstream issue .    in this article , we adopt the simplest local similarity indices .",
    "_ @xcite have investigated the performances of these ten local indices , including common neighbors ( cn ) , salton index @xcite , jaccard index @xcite , srensen index @xcite , hub promoted index ( hpi ) @xcite , hub depressed index ( hdi ) @xcite , leicht - holme - newman index ( lhn ) @xcite , preferential attachment ( pa ) @xcite , adamic - adar index ( aa ) @xcite and resource allocation index ( ra ) @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the ra index performs best , and lhn and pa indices perform the worst .",
    "however , these results are obtained based on random probe set division . in this article , we will compare the performances of these ten indices on predicting the missing links with low - degree nodes .",
    "their mathematical expressions are shown in table  [ table1 ] . the detailed information on these ten indices can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . note that , the above indices except pa , are all common - neighbor based .",
    "therein salton index , jaccard index , srensen index , hpi , hdi and lhn are different in the dominators which take into account the degrees of the two endpoints of the predicted links , while aa and ra indices consider the effects of their common neighbors degrees .",

    ", the probe links are randomly selected from @xmath2 , namely each link has equal probability to be selected into probe set ( called _ random sampling _ ) . in this way , the algorithmic accuracy measured by auc is actually an average prediction accuracy of the probe links .",
    "however , the links may have different predictabilities for their different roles in the network .",
    "some prediction algorithms may be good at predicting the links connecting the high - degree nodes , while some are adept in the links connecting the low - degree nodes .",
    "therefore , in order to evaluate the performance of different algorithms on different links , the dataset should be divided with preference .    motivated by evaluating the algorithm s performance on uncovering the links with low - degree nodes , in this paper",
    ", we propose a preferential partition method according to the link _ popularity _ which is defined as : @xmath22 where @xmath20 denotes the degree of node @xmath7 .",
    "clearly , links with high - degree endpoints have higher popularities than those with low - degree ends .",
    "thus for a given network , the links whose popularities are higher than the average popularity @xmath23 are popular links , and those with lower popularities than @xmath24 are unpopular links .",
    "the detailed partition steps are as follows : ( i ) calculate the popularity score of each observed link according to eq .",

    "( i.e. , spider sampling or breadth first sampling , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which is a non - probability technique and gets widely used in the studies of world wide webs and large - scale social networks . in the beginning of this method ,",

    "this process keeps on until a required number of nodes are sampled out . obviously , it is not relevant for the link prediction problem because this method only leaves missing nodes rather than missing links .    the second one , called _ acquaintance sampling _ ,",
    "is motivated by epidemic immunization with lack of information @xcite . in this method , at each time step , a random link of a randomly selected node is sampled out ( i.e. , being put into the training set ) until a required number of links have already been selected . considering a link @xmath78 ,",
    "if it is not yet sampled out , the probability it will be selected at this time step is @xmath79 .",
    "although a link with lower popularity is not necessarily with high @xmath80 , statistically speaking , the probability @xmath79 is negatively correlated with the popularity @xmath81 . to our knowledge , this method is a very special method where unpopular links are more likely to be sampled out yet the popular links consist of the probe set .",
    "the third one is named _ random - walk sampling _ @xcite .",
    "a simple way adopted is as follows : ( i ) initialize a particle on a randomly selected node ; ( ii ) this particle jumps to a randomly selected neighbor and the corresponding link will be added into the training set ( i.e. , sampled out ) ; ( iii ) repeat ( ii ) until a certain number of links have been sampled out , and the rest links compose the probe set .",
    "it is well - known that the distribution of visiting frequency of a random walker on a connected network will soon converges to the degree distribution , namely the probability at a certain time step the random walker locate in a node @xmath7 , say @xmath82 , is equal to @xmath83 , where @xmath84 serves as a normalization factor . considering a link @xmath78 ,",
    "if it is not yet sampled out , the probability it will be selected at this time step is @xmath85 .",
    "that is to say , the average popularity of links in the probe set is approximately the same to that from the random sampling ( we have checked it by simulation ) . however , the random - walk sampling is not the same as random sampling , for example , the sampled network from the former is always connected yet the one from the latter may contain several components .",
    "the last one is called path - based sampling , which has been applied in extracting the topology of internet at router level ( http://www.routerviews.org ) .",
    "indeed , this method tracks the transmission of information packets in the internet , and a link passed by more packets has higher probability to be sampled out . to simulate this process , at each time step ,",
    "we randomly select a starting point and an end , and we assume that a packet will go from the starting point to the end through a randomly selected shortest path .",
    "after a sufficiently large number of time steps , a link with more than a threshold , @xmath86 , packets will be put into the training set while others compose the probe set . here for simplicity , we set @xmath87 . under this method , the links with high betweenness centrality ( betweenness centrality quantifies the traffic load of a link , depending on the routing strategy of packet transmission @xcite ) are favored .",
    "since the popularity of a link is strongly positively correlated with its betweenness centrality on shortest - path routing , the average popularity of links in the probe set is lower than that of the random sampling .",
    "the average popularities of missing links corresponding to different sampling methods are shown in table 6 .",
    "agreeing with our analysis , the average popularities of the links in the probe set obeys the inequality @xmath88 .",
    "figure 4 reports the algorithmic performance ( measured by the auc value ) for different sampling methods and different @xmath66 .",
    "very clearly , aiming to predict popular links ( e.g. , under acquaintance sampling ) @xmath70 is negative while to predict cold links , @xmath70 is positive .",
    "in fact , there is strongly negative correlation between the average popularity of links in the probe set and the optimal value of lambda . as shown in figure 5 , where we order the three sampling methods with decreasing average popularity of missing links and thus a positive correlation is observed .",
    "to our knowledge , in the previous studies on link prediction @xcite , the data sets are always divided in a random manner .",
    "inspired by the in - depth thought about the features of missing links , this article challenges such a straightforward method . applying a simple measure on link popularity ,",
    "we propose a method to sample less popular links for probe set .",
    "experimental analysis shows a surprising result that the lhn index performs the best , although it was known to be one of the worst indices if the probe set is a random sampling of all links .",
    "we propose a similarity index with a free parameter @xmath66 , by tuning which this index can degenerate to the common neighbor index , the salton index and the lhn index .",
    "the optimal value of @xmath66 monotonously depends on the average link popularity of probe set .",
    "we further test this index on three real sampling methods . agreeing with the main results from theoretical analysis , the optimal value of @xmath66 increases with the decreasing of the average popularity of links in the probe set .",
    "again , the improved index in a well - tuned range can outperform others under real sampling methods .",
    "notice that , the main contribution of this article does not lie on the proposed index .",
    "instead , the significance of this work is to raise the serious question about how to properly determine the probe set . to us",
    ", this is a very important yet completely ignored problem in information filtering .",
    "the reconsideration of dataset division will largely change the understanding and thus the design of algorithms in information filtering ( also relevant to the so - called recommendation problem @xcite ) . as a start point",
    ", we give a naive method and a preliminary analysis , which is of course far from an satisfied answer to the question .",
    "in fact , we think in - depth understanding of real sampling methods may shed light on this issue .",
