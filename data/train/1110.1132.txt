    "it is well known that pure einstein gravity is ultraviolet ( uv ) divergent at two loops  @xcite .",
    "this result , along with general power - counting arguments , has led to the widespread belief that a uv finite pointlike theory of gravity can not be constructed .",
    "however , explicit calculations of scattering amplitudes in maximally supersymmetric ( @xmath2 ) supergravity have displayed an ultraviolet behavior that is much better than prior expectations , showing that the theory in four dimensions is finite up to at least four loops .",
    "furthermore , @xmath2 supergravity exhibits the same uv behavior , when continued to higher spacetime dimensions , as does @xmath3 super - yang - mills ( sym )  @xcite .",
    "surprising cancellations are also visible at lower loop orders  @xcite , and even at tree level where the amplitudes are nicely behaved at large ( complex ) momenta  @xcite .    in pure supergravity theories ( where all states are related by supersymmetry to the graviton ) no counterterm can be constructed below three loops .",
    "this is because the only possible two - loop counterterm , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the riemann tensor , generates non - zero four - graviton amplitudes with helicity assignment @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "such amplitudes are forbidden by the ward identities for the minimal @xmath7 supersymmetry  @xcite .",
    "the counterterm denoted by @xmath8 is allowed by supersymmetry and could appear at three loops  @xcite . however , as mentioned earlier , @xmath2 supergravity was found to be finite at this order  @xcite .",
    "it was recently understood that the @xmath8 counterterm is forbidden  @xcite by the nonlinear @xmath9 symmetry realized by the 70 scalars of the theory  @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xmath9 should delay the divergence in @xmath2 supergravity to at least seven loops , where the first @xmath9-invariant counterterm can be constructed  @xcite .",
    "non - maximal ( @xmath10 ) supergravity does not have this extra @xmath9 symmetry , and may therefore diverge at only three loops in four dimensions .",
    "recently , the constraints that the smaller duality symmetries of non - maximal supergravities impose on potential counterterms have also been investigated  @xcite . in four dimensions ,",
    "@xmath11 supergravity is expected to be finite at three and four loops , and @xmath12 supergravity should be finite at three loops  @xcite .",
    "these results still allow for a three - loop divergence in @xmath13 supergravities .",
    "in particular , for @xmath3 supergravity , although the volume of superspace vanishes on shell , it has been argued that the usual three - loop @xmath8 counterterm can appear  @xcite .",
    "the finiteness results for @xmath14 could in principle be checked , and potential divergences for @xmath13 investigated , via explicit three - loop amplitude calculations in non - maximal supergravities . because the same situation , in which the superspace volume vanishes on shell , and yet a counterterm appears to be allowed , holds for @xmath2 supergravity at seven loops , as for @xmath3 supergravity at three loops , this latter case may be of particular interest .    on the other hand ,",

    "the @xmath3 supergravity one - loop five - point amplitude was also computed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the following , we present expressions for the two - loop four - graviton amplitudes in @xmath0 supergravity .",
    "the calculations were performed using the gravity  squaring \" relations  @xcite , or double - copy property , which follows from the color - kinematics , or bern - carrasco - johansson ( bcj ) , duality obeyed by gauge - theory amplitudes at the loop level  @xcite .",

    "( in the self - dual sector at tree level , a diffeomorphism lie algebra appears to play a key role .",
    "therefore it is important to validate results obtained using bcj duality .",

    "we present the finite remainders in the two independent kinematic channels . in",
    "we examine the behavior of the amplitudes in the limit of forward scattering . in",
    ", we present our conclusions and suggestions for future research directions .",
    "an appendix provides some one - loop results that are required for extracting the two - loop finite remainders .",
    "we now briefly review bcj duality and the gravity squaring relations that follow from it . for a more complete treatment see , for example , the recent reviews  @xcite . here",

    "the @xmath31 are the internal symmetry factors for each diagram .",
    "the form of the amplitude presented in   can be obtained in various ways .",
    "for example , one can start from covariant feynman diagrams in feynman gauge , where the contact terms are absorbed into kinematic numerators using inverse propagators , _",
    "i.e. _  by inserting factors of @xmath32",
    ".    triplets @xmath33 of color factors are related to each other by @xmath34 if their corresponding graphs are identical , except for a region containing ( in turn for @xmath35 ) the three cubic four - point graphs that exist at tree level .",
    "the relation holds because the products of two @xmath36 structure constants corresponding to the four - point tree graphs satisfy the jacobi identity ^abe ^cde  =  ^ace ^bde + ^ade ^cbe , [ ffjacobi ] and the remaining structure constant factors in the triplet of graphs are identical .",
    "the relations @xmath34 mean that the representation  ( [ loopgauge ] ) is not unique ; terms can be shuffled from one graph to others , in a kind of generalized gauge transformation  @xcite .",
    "a representation  ( [ loopgauge ] ) is said to satisfy the bcj duality if the three associated kinematic numerators are also related via jacobi identities .",
    "namely , we must have : @xmath37 where the left - hand side follows directly from group theory , while the right - hand side is the highly non - trivial requirement of the duality .",
    "moreover , we demand that the numerator factors have the same antisymmetry property as the color factors under the interchange of two legs attached to a cubic vertex , @xmath38 the relations  ( [ jacobi ] ) were found long ago for the case of four - point tree amplitudes  @xcite ; the idea that the relations should hold for arbitrary amplitudes is more recent  @xcite .",
    "as remarked earlier , the representation  ( [ loopgauge ] ) is not unique .",
    "work is often required in order to find a bcj - satisfying representation of a given amplitude in a particular gauge theory . at loop level",
    ", such representations were found initially at four points through three loops for @xmath3 sym , and through two loops for identical - helicity pure yang - mills amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "a bcj - satisfying representation was recently obtained at five points through three loops in @xmath3 sym  @xcite .",
    "very recently , a four - point four - loop representation was found in the same theory  @xcite .    as a remarkable consequence of the bcj duality ,",
    "one can combine two gauge - theory amplitudes in the form  ( [ loopgauge ] ) , in order to obtain a gravity amplitude , as long as one of the two gauge - theory representations manifestly satisfies the duality  @xcite .",

    "the extrapolation to loop level is based on reconstructing loop amplitudes from tree amplitudes using ( generalized ) unitarity .",
    "the relations  ( [ bcj_gravity ] ) are similar in spirit to the klt relations  @xcite .",
    "both types of relations express gravity amplitudes as the `` square '' of gauge - theory amplitudes , or more generally as the product of two different types of gauge - theory amplitudes , as the @xmath45 and @xmath40 numerator factors may come from two different yang - mills theories .",
    "however , the klt relations only hold at tree level , which means that at loop level they can only be used on the ( generalized ) unitarity cuts .",
    "although the gravity cuts can be completely determined by the klt relations in terms of local yang - mills integrands , the gravity integrand found in this way is not manifestly local .",
    "that is , it does not manifestly have the form of numerator factors multiplied by scalar propagators for some set of @xmath25 graphs . reconstructing a local representation",
    "can be a significant task  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , is a loop - level relation , and furnishes directly a local integrand for gravity .",
    "most of the applications of this formula to date have been to maximal @xmath2 supergravity , viewed as the tensor product of two copies of maximal @xmath3 super - yang - mills theory .",
    "the squaring relations were shown to reproduce the @xmath2 supergravity four - point amplitudes through four loops  @xcite and the five - point amplitudes through two loops  @xcite . quite recently , in the first loop - level applications for @xmath10 , the one - loop four- and five - point @xmath15 supergravity amplitudes were shown to satisfy the double - copy property  @xcite . in this paper , we would like to extend this kind of analysis for @xmath10 supergravity to two loops .",

    "-.9 cm    in this section we review the construction of the two - loop four - graviton amplitude in @xmath2 supergravity based on squaring relations , as preparation for a similar construction for @xmath0 supergravity in the next section .    as mentioned previously , a manifestly bcj - satisfying representation of the four - gluon @xmath3 sym amplitude",

    "the tree subdiagram is the one whose intermediate propagator is the light - blue line marked @xmath57 in the figure .",
    "we replace the `` @xmath58-channel '' tree subdiagram with the corresponding @xmath59- and @xmath60-channel tree subdiagrams , by appropriately permuting the attachments of line @xmath57 to the rest of the graph .",
    "this jacobi identity is illustrated in  .",
    "because the @xmath3 sym diagrams with triangle one - loop subdiagrams all have vanishing coefficients in , the duality  ( [ jacobi ] ) requires the equality of the planar and nonplanar numerator factors , @xmath61 .",
    "similarly , applying a jacobi identity to the red propagator marked @xmath62 in the planar double - box diagram in  , we find two graphs , one of which again contains a vanishing triangle subgraph . therefore the numerator of the planar box graph should be symmetric under the exchange of legs 1 and 2 , or equivalently @xmath63 .",
    "looking at  , we see that these two conditions are satisfied .",
    "having verified that satisfies the bcj relations , we may combine two copies of ( [ 2loopneq4ym ] ) following prescription  ( [ bcj_gravity ] ) to obtain the two - loop four - graviton @xmath2 amplitude .",

    "it is also interesting to consider the helicity - violating limit in which @xmath141 for @xmath102 kinematics @xmath152 . as mentioned before , the associated tree - level amplitude is power - suppressed in this limit with respect to the dominant pole behavior ; its leading behavior is @xmath140 . in this limit ,",
    "many of the finite - remainder expressions naively appear to blow up ( see for instance as @xmath153 ) .",
    "however , one can check in all cases that these spurious singularities cancel , and the leading behavior of the ratio of the one- and two - loop amplitudes to the tree amplitude is of @xmath154 , @xmath155 .",

    "our task was vastly simplified by the fact that both sets of yang - mills amplitudes entering the double - copy formula were known , as well as by the lack of loop - momentum dependence for the @xmath3 sym amplitudes in this case . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "generic @xmath10 supergravity theories are expected to diverge at three loops ( but not @xmath160 or 6  @xcite ) , because the counterterm @xmath8 is allowed by supersymmetry .",
    "it would thus be very interesting to compute explicit three - loop non - maximal supergravity amplitudes .",
    "if one computes in @xmath161 supergravity , then one can use the double - copy formula , because a bcj - satisfying form exists for one of the two copies , namely the three - loop @xmath3 sym amplitude  @xcite .",
    "however , for the other gauge - theory copy , @xmath75 sym , the three - loop amplitudes are not known .",
    "full - color amplitudes ( including nonplanar terms ) are required , and they should be known at the level of the integrand , because the bcj form for the three - loop @xmath3 sym amplitude contains loop - momentum dependence in its numerator factors .",
    "bcj duality for @xmath75 sym could help simplify these gauge - theory calculations . for instance , for the three - loop four - point @xmath3 sym amplitude , the duality reduced the computation of the full amplitude to the evaluation of the maximal cut  @xcite of a single diagram  @xcite .",
    "non - maximal amplitude calculations are not expected to be as simple , however .",

    "<S> these results were obtained using the double - copy structure of gravity , which follows from the recently conjectured color - kinematics duality in gauge theory . </S>",
    "<S> the two - loop four - gluon scattering amplitudes in @xmath1 supersymmetric gauge theory are a second essential ingredient . </S>",
    "<S> the gravity amplitudes have the expected infrared behavior : the two - loop divergences are given in terms of the squares of the corresponding one - loop amplitudes . the finite remainders are presented in a compact form . the finite remainder for @xmath2 supergravity </S>",
    "<S> is also presented , in a form that utilizes a pure function with a very simple symbol .    </S>",
