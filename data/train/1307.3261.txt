    "the motivation which served as starting point for the present work is that in principle the same third order non - linearity in fused silica optical fibers which is responsible for the sfwm process also permits a different process : third - order spontaneous parametric downconversion ( tospdc )  @xcite . while in the sfwm process ,",

    "furthermore , the fact that the pump must propagate in the @xmath142 mode for our phasematching strategy limits the power than can be coupled from , say , a gaussian - transverse - distributed pump mode in free space ; this will tend to limit the attainable source brightness .",

    "the combination of a small fiber diameter and a large core - cladding index of refraction contrast leads to a strong waveguide contribution to the overall dispersion experienced by the propagating fields which can enhance nonlinear optical effects , including tosdpc .",
    "note that similar results could be obtained with photonic crystal fibers involving a large air - filling fraction in the cladding .",
