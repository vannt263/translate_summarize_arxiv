    "over the last few years there has been tremendous activity in studying the coherent interaction of matter and radiation in a rich variety of `` matter  light '' systems .",
    "recent experiments have combined cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cavity qed ) with cold atomic gases , and allow access to the strongly coupled regime .",
    "this has led to pioneering work on bose  einstein condensates ( becs ) in ultra high finesse optical cavities @xcite , and with optical fibers on atom chips @xcite .",
    "it has also stimulated advances in cavity opto - mechanics and condensate dynamics @xcite .",
    "more recently , strong matter ",

    "allied advances in solid state devices include cavity qed experiments with superconducting qubits in microwave resonators @xcite .",
    "this has provided clean realizations of the paradigmatic jaynes ",
    "cummings @xcite and dicke models @xcite , describing two - level systems coupled to radiation .",
    "it has also led to remarkable observations of the lamb shift @xcite .",
    "this is complemented by the quest for polariton condensates in semiconductor microcavities @xcite , where the hybridization of an exciton and a photon yields low effective mass polaritons .",
    "this offers the prospect of higher transition temperatures than for exciton bec , and gives access to coherence properties via the cavity light field .    motivated by this broad spectrum of activity",

    "this is a natural generalization of the much studied two - level systems coupled to radiation , and may serve as a useful paradigm in other contexts . in ref .",
    "@xcite we discussed the interplay of mott physics , photo - excitation , and bose condensation promoted by carrier itinerancy .",
    "in particular , we provided evidence for a novel mott phase with photo - excitations analogous to polaritons . in this work",

    "we begin in section [ sect : model ] with an introduction to the two - band bose  hubbard model coupled to quantum light @xcite .",
    "in section [ sect : zero ] we discuss the zero hopping limit of this model and anchor the phase diagram .",
    "we study the evolution with the strength of the matter  light coupling and highlight the connections to the dicke model and the superradiance transition @xcite . in section [",
    "sect : hopping ] we use a variational approach to obtain the overall phase diagram in the presence of hopping .",
    "we corroborate our findings in section [ sect : numerics ] using numerical simulations .",
    "we discuss the relation to the bosonic bec  bcs crossover and to other problems of current interest in section [ sect : other ] .",
    "we conclude in section [ sect : conc ] and provide technical appendices .",
    "let us consider a two - band bose  hubbard model coupled to the quantum light field of an optical cavity in the rotating wave approximation @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 labels lattice sites , and @xmath2 are bosons obeying canonical commutation relations @xmath3=\\delta_{ij}$ ]",
    ". these might be states of different orbital or spin angular momentum , and we assume the cavity radiation field , @xmath4 , may induce photo - excitations between these states ; see fig .  [",

    "this yields @xmath9 for like species and @xmath10 for distinct species .",
    "@xmath11 are nearest neighbor hopping parameters , and @xmath12 is the frequency of the cavity mode . for simplicity",
    "we consider just a single mode which couples uniformly to the bands .",
    "the coupling @xmath13 is the strength of the matter  light interaction . in view of the box normalization of the photon field ,",
    "the dipole coupling strength is proportional to @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the volume of the cavity . with a fixed density of lattice sites , @xmath16 , it is convenient to denote @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the total number of lattice sites .",
    "we work in units where the half - band splitting @xmath19",
    ".    an important feature of the hamiltonian ( [ qlmodel ] ) is that the individual atom and photon numbers are _ not _ conserved due to the matter ",
    "light interaction .",
    "however , the total number of atomic carriers @xmath20 and the total number of photo - excitations @xmath21 are conserved and commute with @xmath22 .",
    "the latter counts the total number of photons plus particle  hole pairs , and we refer to these composite excitations as `` polaritons ''  see fig .",
    "[ fig : bhpolariton ] .",
    "these conservation laws reflect the global @xmath23 symmetry of @xmath22 such that @xmath24 where @xmath25 . in general this symmetry",
    "involves mixing between the matter  light sectors .",
    "moreover , it also allows for the simultaneous coexistence of mott behavior and condensation , corresponding to an unbroken @xmath26 and broken @xmath26 symmetry respectively .",
    "this symmetry will have a direct manifestation in the phase diagram , and will suggest implications for other multicomponent problems .",
    "we will work in the grand canonical ensemble : @xmath27 we begin by assuming that @xmath28 are strongly interacting hardcore bosons , @xmath29 , and that @xmath30 are sufficiently dilute so that we may neglect their interactions , @xmath31 .",
    "we will also start with @xmath32 , before discussing departures from these conditions .",
    "before embarking on a detailed examination of the model ( [ qlmodel ] ) , we investigate the zero hopping limit . as in the single - band bose  hubbard model @xcite this anchors the topology of the general phase diagram . in the present case",
    "this is particularly informative since the zero hopping phase diagram evolves with the matter  light coupling , @xmath13 .",
    "in addition , the global photon mode couples _ all _ the sites , even in this zero hopping limit . to gain a handle on this reduced hamiltonian , we find it convenient to develop two complementary approaches .",
    "these help illuminate different aspects of the more general itinerant problem , and provide a platform for extensions .",
    "in section [ sect : zerovar ] we begin with a variational approach using a coherent state ansatz for the photons .",
    "this will enable us to derive an effective single site jaynes  cummings model @xcite for the @xmath33 bosons , and proceed with the minimum of technical input .",
    "in section [ sect : dicke ] we instead map the @xmath33 bosons on to effective spins .",
    "this yields the paradigmatic dicke model @xcite , describing many spins coupled to radiation .",
    "the jaynes  cummings and dicke models are familiar in atomic physics and quantum optics and we provide a brief overview of these closely related hamiltonians in appendix [ app : dicke ] . both approaches yield equivalent results and indicate a novel quantum phase transition occurring within the lowest mott lobe @xcite .",
    "this takes place from a conventional mott state with no photons , to a state with a non - vanishing population of photo - excitations , as the strength of the matter ",
    "light coupling is increased .",
    "this quantum phase transition coincides with the well known superradiance transition in the dicke model @xcite , and we interpret the results in this framework",
    ". the combination of perspectives will be useful in the generalization to the itinerant problem discussed in section [ sect : hopping ] .",

    "we absorb the chemical potentials in to the definitions @xmath37 this bosonic hamiltonian is analogous to the fermionic problem of localized excitons in a microcavity @xcite . an instructive way to analyze",
    "the problem is to consider a coherent state for the cavity light field : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a variational parameter to be determined . as usual , this is an eigenstate of the annihilation operator , @xmath4 , with eigenvalue @xmath39 .",
    "the coherent state assumption is expected to become exact in the thermodynamic limit , and this is borne out by the complementary approach in section [ sect : dicke ] .",

    "this is a significant merit of the current approach , since it is directly tractable without technical input . in view of the hardcore constraint on the @xmath28 atoms ,",
    "this describes a _ single _ two - level system coupled to an effective `` radiation field '' of @xmath30 atoms .",
    "this paradigm is described by the much studied jaynes ",

    "this latter solution is supported in the region where @xmath53 , or when the matter  light coupling exceeds the critical value @xmath54 where for simplicity we consider @xmath55 . as we shall discuss in section [ sect : dicke ] , this onset of the photon field corresponds to the well known superradiance transition in the dicke model @xcite .",

    "we shall give an alternative derivation of these results in section [ sect : dicke ] .",
    "this complementary approach becomes asymptotically exact in the thermodynamic limit and helps justify the coherent state ansatz ( [ cs ] ) .",

    "the energy density in the superradiant mott phase is @xmath338 similarly , in the @xmath28-type superfluid @xmath339 minimizing on @xmath340 yields either @xmath145 or @xmath341 .",
    "the latter yields @xmath342 the condition @xmath343 yields the mi  asf boundary @xmath344 or equivalently @xmath182 .",
    "this meets the superradiance onset @xmath345 at @xmath346 or @xmath347 in a similar fashion , the transition between the superradiant mott state and the a - type superfluid occurs when @xmath348 or @xmath349",
    "in fig .  [ fig : zerohop ] we see that only the mott lobe with atomic density , @xmath85 , is supported due to the coupling to the quantum light field . to prove that only this lobe survives we compare the energies of the higher states to those depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : zerohop ] . without loss of generality",
    "we may focus on the stable region defined by @xmath350 . within this domain @xmath351 and @xmath352 are both smoothly increasing functions of @xmath77 . furthermore ,",
    "whilst the super - radiance condition ( [ gc ] ) holds , @xmath353 .",
    "we immediately conclude that whenever the @xmath85 superradiance condition is met ( @xmath354 ) , the ground state energy is either @xmath355 or @xmath356 , the vacuum energy .",
    "however , outside of this region we must examine whether the lowest energy superradiant state is lower in energy than either @xmath357 or the vacuum .    to address this",
    "let us consider superradiant states with @xmath358 .",
    "these are candidates for the ground state within the region , @xmath359 , where the upper bound follows from the superradiance condition and the lower bound precludes the region in which @xmath355 is supported . if @xmath360 , taking roots of the inequality yields @xmath361 and @xmath362 . in conjunction with the condition for stability",
    ", we see that @xmath363 .",
    "that is to say , the ground state never has @xmath358 .    if @xmath364 a stronger statement can be made . invoking the superradiance condition , @xmath365",
    ", it follows that @xmath366 for _ all _ @xmath77 .",
    "hence the vacuum must be the ground state when @xmath367 .",
    "( the latter implies @xmath368 , where the last inequality has followed from the stability requirement ) .",
    "we see that a sufficient condition for termination of the mott lobe is @xmath70 .",
    "however , since @xmath369 in general , such regimes are only stable for @xmath370 ; see fig .",
