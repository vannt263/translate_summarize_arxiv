    "in order to explain the heavy ion collision results , some information about hadrons parameters at finite temperature and density is required .",
    "some of the characteristic parameters at finite temperature and density are the masses and leptonic decay constants of hadrons .",
    "the investigation of these parameters requires non - perturbative approaches .",
    "one of these non - perturbative methods is the qcd sum rules @xcite , formulated by shifman , vainshtein and zakharov .",
    "the extension of the qcd sum rules method to finite temperatures has been made by bochkarev and shaposhnikov @xcite .",
    "this extension is based on two basic assumptions that the ope and notion of quark - hadron duality remain valid , but the vacuum condensates are replaced by their thermal expectation values . the thermal qcd sum rules method has been extensively used for studying thermal properties of both light and heavy hadrons as a reliable and well - establish method @xcite-@xcite .    the investigation of heavy meson decay constants at zero temperature has been widely discussed in the literature @xcite . the knowledge of these constants is needed in order to predict numerous heavy flavor electroweak transitions and to determine standard model parameters from the experimental data . also leptonic decay constants play essential role in the analysis of ckm matrix , cp violation and the mixings @xmath2 , @xmath3 .",
    "the first determination of these constants were made twenty years ago @xcite-@xcite and due to further theoretical and experimental progress , this problem was reconsidered taking into account the running quark masses and perturbative three - loop @xmath4 corrections to the correlation function @xcite , @xcite . at finite temperatures",
    "the nonperturbative nature of qcd vacuum induces temperature dependences of the leptonic decay constants and masses .",
    "recently , first attempts have been made in order to calculate the leptonic decay constants of heavy mesons at finite temperature in the framework of thermal qcd sum rules @xcite .    in the present paper , we investigate the temperature behavior of the masses and leptonic decay constants of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons using qcd sum rules . taking into account perturbative two - loop order @xmath5 corrections to the correlation function and nonperturbative corrections up to the dimension six condensates @xcite we investigated the temperature dependences of masses and leptonic decay constants using borel transform sum rules and hilbert moment sum rules . for increased sensitivity",
    ", we subtract the vacuum contributions from thermal expressions and study the temperature dependences of the leptonic decay constants and meson masses .",
    "we start with pseudoscalar two - point thermal correlator @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the heavy - light quark current and has the quantum numbers of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are heavy and strange quark masses respectively .",
    "we shall not neglect @xmath10 quark mass throughout this work .",
    "thermal average of any operator _",
    "o _ is defined in the following way @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the qcd hamiltonian , @xmath13 stands for the inverse of the temperature @xmath14 and traces are over any complete set of states . up to a subtraction polynomial , which depends on the large @xmath15 behavior",

    "therefore we will omit these terms .",
    "the thermal propagator contains on - shell soft quarks which do not exist in the confined phase .",
    "therefore , in obtaining the ope of the thermal correlator ( 1 ) , vacuum propagators must be used @xcite .",
