    "in recent years , the physics of exotic nuclei attracts more attentions both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "due to the closeness of the fermi surface to the particle continuum in exotic nuclei the coupling between bound states and the particle continuum become important .",
    "the description of exotic nuclei has to explicitly include the coupling between bound states and the continuum@xcite .",
    "although there are several extensive theoretical studies of exotic nuclei using relativistic and non - relativistic microscopic methods@xcite , a rigorous treatment of the continuum for exotic nuclei is still under investigation .",
    "nuclei beyond the drip line are usually unbound and often exhibit resonances with a pronounced single - particle character , which are single - particle resonance states .",
    "the direct emission of charged particle from an unbound ground state has been observed in the three - body decay of @xmath1o@xcite , which is closely linked with the energies and widths of resonant - states . in microscopic studies",
    "nuclear collective giant resonances are explained by the particle - hole excitations in a coherent way , where the particle continuum plays an important role@xcite .",
    "the contribution from the resonant states in the giant resonances has been studied in the so - called resonant random phase approximation in the non - relativistic approach by curutchet et .",
    "it was found that the contribution of the particle continuum is mainly from the single - particle resonances in the continuum .",
    "therefore , the exploration of single - particle resonant - states becomes very important in explaining the properties of ground states , dynamical processes of nuclei , excited nuclei , especially in understanding properties of nuclei far from the @xmath2 stable line .",
    "it is known that in most previous theoretical nuclear structure calculations , when the contribution from the continuum is performed the single - particle states in the continuum are usually treated by a discretization procedure with expanding the wave functions in a harmonic oscillator basis or setting a box@xcite .",
    "this approximation , however , can be justified for very narrow resonances and gives a global description of the contributions from the continuum .",
    "it is desirable to explore the resonant continuum and look for efficient methods for the description of single - particle resonance states .",
    "there are several techniques developed to explore resonant - states in the continuum .",
    "a possible approach is the reaction method based on r - matrix theory . analyzing the r - matrix and using the relation to the collision matrix",
    "permit one to define the energies and widths of resonant - states@xcite .",
    "this method is mainly used to analyze experimental data or within phenomenological models for simple interactions and systems . for composite many - body systems , the real stabilization method@xcite by solving the schrdinger equation in changing the box s size within certain limits",
    "is implemented for finding the energies and widths of resonant - continuum states . the complex scaling method combined with the hartree - fock method@xcite",
    "is thought as an effective method in exploring wider resonant - states .",
    "it is performed by rotating the coordinate @xmath3 by an unbounded non - unitary scaling operator and transforming the continuum resonance wave function to the normalizable wave function of the bound state .",
    "recently , the authors of ref.@xcite apply the analytic continuation in the coupling constant method to find energies and widths of resonant - states .",
    "most of works described above are performed only in the framework of non - relativistic approach .",
    "recently relativistic mean field models ( rmf ) have been successfully applied to a variety of problems in nuclear structure and reactions . to deal with the continuum one requires the knowledge of the resonant in the continuum in the relativistic approach .",
    "it is the main purpose of this paper to explore the single - particle resonant - states in the framework of rmf models .    in the present work",
    ", we aim at the investigation of the resonant - states by s - matrix method in the rmf .",
    "the scattering states of dirac equation are treated with a proper asymptotic behavior .",
    "the regular and irregular relativistic coulomb wave functions for the dirac equation can be derived analytically .",
    "energies , widths and wave functions of single particle resonances in the continuum are solved consistently in the coordinate space .",
    "the energy of a resonant - state is determined when the phase shift of the scattering state reaches @xmath4 .",
    "the width of a resonant - state is the full width of half magnitude ( fwhm ) for the corresponding partial wave scattering cross section .",
    "the s - matrix method is a straightforward and feasible method , which is suitable for various cases , light and heavy , stable and exotic nuclei .",
    "we shall study the single - particle resonant - states for @xmath0sn in this paper . in order to verify the importance of exploring the resonances in the continuum we study the response function of isoscalar octupole response for @xmath0sn in the framework of a fully consistent relativistic random phase approximation based on the rmf . by analyzing the distribution of the octupole strength",
    ", we will show that the contributions in the giant resonance processes of nuclei mainly come from the single - particle resonant - states in the continuum .",
    "our results are consistent with the previous studies of giant resonances by means of the so - called resonant random phase approximation in the non - relativistic approach by curutchet et .",
    "al.@xcite , where the single particle basis is composed of single particle bound and resonant states .",
    "the paper is arranged as the follows .",
    "in sec.ii the s - matrix methods in the dirac equation is presented .",
    "the single particle resonances of @xmath0sn are given in sec.iii .",
    "we study the octupole resonance of @xmath0sn with those single particle resonances in the continuum in sec .",
    "finally we give a brief summary in sec .",
    "the dirac equation of a single - particle state in the rmf approximation can be expressed as following , @xmath5 \\psi _ i = e_i\\psi _ i~ ,   \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the single - particle energy and wave function , respectively . @xmath8 and @xmath9 are an attractive scalar and repulsive vector potential , respectively . in the rmf approximation ,",
    "scalar and vector potentials are produced by the classical meson fields : isoscalar @xmath10 , @xmath11 and isovector @xmath12 mesons as well as the photon , which are obtained in a self - consistent calculation for the nuclear ground state@xcite .",
    "the nucleon spinor @xmath13 in the dirac equation is expressed as , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a set of quantum numbers @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the isospinor . for spherical nuclei ,",
    "the dirac equation can be reduced to coupled equations of the radial part for @xmath19 and @xmath20 . @xmath21",
    "single - particle bound states as well as the scalar and vector potentials for the nuclear ground state are determined self - consistently by solving the dirac equation in an iterative way . with those scalar and vector potentials unoccupied bound states",
    "can be calculated straightforward",
    ". for scattering states , a proper asymptotic condition for each partial wave has to be imposed . at a large distance ,",
    "say @xmath22 = 15 fm for light nuclei and 20 fm for heavy nuclei , nuclear potentials generated by exchanging mesons vanish , and only coulomb potential remains . in the relativistic approach",
    "a spin dependent interaction even with only coulomb interaction is built into the theory automatically .",
    "therefore coulomb functions of the dirac equation are different from those in the non - relativistic approach .",
    "the relativistic treatment of the coulomb functions are rather difficult task , which is described in detail in refs.@xcite .",
    "two independent solutions of real coulomb radial functions are denoted by @xmath23 , @xmath24 corresponding to @xmath25 and @xmath26 in the eq.[eq2 ] for the solution regular at the origin and by @xmath27 , @xmath28 for the solution irregular at the origin .",
    "@xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 and the phase @xmath32 is determined by @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34 is the fine structure constant and @xmath35 is the wave number @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 is the confluent hypergeometric function .",
    "@xmath38 denotes the complex conjugate .",
    "the irregular solutions are obtained from those in eq.[eq4 ] by the change of the sign of @xmath39 .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of regular and irregular solutions are @xmath40 the coulomb phase shift @xmath41 has a slightly different expression as that in the non - relativistic case , @xmath42 , which depends not only on the orbital angular momentum @xmath43 but also on the total angular momentum @xmath44 .",
    "it is found that deviations of the upper components in the dirac coulomb functions from the coulomb wave functions in the non - relativistic approach are pronounced in the case that the nucleus is very heavy ( for example in the extreme case @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) .",
    "for the neutron case , they reduce to spherical bessel functions",
    ".      the resonant - state is characterized by the phase shift @xmath48 crossing to @xmath4 , where the scattering cross section of the corresponding partial wave reaches its maximum .",
    "those single - particle resonant - states are meta - stable states captured by coulomb(for proton ) and centrifugal barriers , which wave functions have large probabilities inside the nuclear potential . for the proton , it is easy to form resonant - states due to the presence of an appreciably high coulomb barrier outside of the nucleus .",
    "in contrast , for the neutron the resonant - state with a low orbital angular momentum does not always exist because of the lack of a sufficiently high centrifugal barrier .",
    "the decay widths of those resonant - states can be roughly explained by considering the penetrability through the coulomb and centrifugal barriers in view of quantum mechanics .",
    "the width of the resonant - state may be determined by the fwhm of the corresponding partial wave scattering cross section .",
    "we investigate the single particle resonant - states in the continuum for @xmath0sn in terms of the s - matrix method in the rmf approximation described above .",
    "the single - particle energy levels for @xmath0sn are shown in fig.1 together with the central potentials .",
    "all results are calculated with nl3 parameter set@xcite .",
    "those states with positive energy in the continuum in fig.1 are the resonant - states we have found .",
    "energies and their widths of those single particle resonances for @xmath0sn are listed in table 1 .",
    "it is found that some states with very small positive energies , such as neutron 1h@xmath49 state ( 0.229+@xmath50 ) mev are very narrow .",
    "it is due to the presence of appreciably high and thick centrifugal ( and coulomb ) barriers .",
    "those states are rather stable and have bound state characteristics .",
    "the effect of the dirac coulomb wave function for @xmath0sn with z=50 is investigated .",
    "the relativistic effects on the coulomb wave functions are not large due to the fact that the nuclide sn is not too heavy and @xmath51 .",
    "it is found that the largest deviation of the resonance energy for the @xmath52 state is within a few percent if we use non - relativistic coulomb wave functions for the upper component of the dirac spinor instead .",
    "in addition to those resonant - states , some state near the top of the barrier has the following properties : the partial wave cross section has a resonant character , which reaches its maximum value , while the phase shift closes to , but not reaches @xmath53 .",
    "those states may be called as resonant - like states , such as proton state 2g@xmath54 for @xmath0sn .",
    "recently , a fully self - consistent relativistic random phase approximation ( rrpa ) @xcite has been established based on the rmf approximation and has achieved a success in describing the multipole giant resonance properties of closed shell nuclei@xcite . in those investigations ,",
    "the particle continuum is treated by a discretization procedure with expanding wave functions in a harmonic oscillator basis .",
    "an energy average with a lorentzian factor was assumed by hand .",
    "it is known from the studies in non - relativistic approaches@xcite that contributions of the continuum to the giant resonances are mainly from those single - particle resonances . in this paper",
    "we perform the rrpa calculation with the continuum replaced by a set of single - particle resonances .",
    "the wave functions of the resonant - states are localized by solving the dirac equation in the coordinate space with a proper box , which position is determined by reproducing the energy of each single - particle resonance .",
    "an advantage of this calculation is that single particle escaping widths in the giant resonance are obtained automatically .",
    "it allows one to obtain the desired quantities very fast .",
    "one can even gain some physical insight on those quantities .",
    "of course it is known that a complete treatment of the continuum may be carried out by the continuum rrpa with a green function method@xcite .",
    "the response function of a quantum system to an external field is given by the imaginary part of the polarization operator@xcite",
    ", @xmath55 where q is an external field operator . in the view of the theoretical method ,",
    "a giant resonance is the coherent superposition of one particle - one hole states with definite spin and parity .",
    "the isoscalar giant octupole ( @xmath56 ) response ( isgor ) of @xmath0sn has not been investigated in the rrpa , although the experiment data are available@xcite . in this paper",
    "we take the isgor of @xmath0sn as an example to examine the contribution of resonant - states in nuclear dynamical processes . we know that the octupole excitation can be identified as two parts : @xmath57 and @xmath58 excitations , which are called the low - energy octupole resonance ( leor ) and high - energy octupole resonance ( heor ) , respectively .",
    "the leor contains a number of configurations , which are mainly contributed from those single particle resonances in the continuum . in the calculation",
    "the particle continuum is replaced by the resonant - states only which are described above .",
    "it has been pointed out @xcite that the contribution of the negative energy dirac states in the rrpa can not be neglected in the isoscalar modes where the scalar meson plays an important role .",
    "therefore in the rrpa calculation based on the rmf ground state the unoccupied states include not only the unoccupied positive energy states , but also the negative energy states in the dirac sea .    in fig.2",
    ", we show the response function of the isgor for @xmath0sn calculated by including the single - particle resonant - states with their widths in the continuum , which are displayed by dashed curves .",
    "response functions , where all discretized states in the continuum with a lorentzian factor @xmath59 mev are included@xcite , are plotted with solid curves .",
    "the unperturbed and rrpa response strengths in two methods are shown in fig.2 ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "the experimental data are plotted by arrows . a good agreement with experiment data",
    "is found , except for the heor , where the theoretical calculations predict slightly higher energy .",
    "the hartree strength in fig.2(a ) are the strength of incoherent particle - hole excitations .",
    "the width of the dashed curve is rather narrow due to the widths of particle resonances , while the width of the solid curve is produced by the energy average .",
    "we analyze the contribution to the hartree strength from various particle - hole pairs .",
    "it is found that those pairs formed between unoccupied and occupied bound states give the important contribution ( @xmath60 ) to the integral of the strength with respect to the energy ( @xmath61 ) in the unperturbed strength .",
    "besides the contributions from the excitations between bound states , the mostly rest strength is produced from the excitations between the occupied hole states and the positive energy single - particle resonant - states . obviously neutron particle - hole configurations are mostly substantial ( @xmath62 in @xmath63 ) , especially for the leor due to heavy nuclei with more neutrons than protons . among them the unoccupied states , e.g. @xmath64 , @xmath65 and single particle resonant state @xmath66 , @xmath67 with narrow widths characterize the largest contributions .",
    "the contribution to @xmath63 from wide single particle resonant states , e.g. @xmath68 are small , but not negligible .",
    "the low - lying strength at @xmath69 , is completely formed from the neutron excitation between bound levels : @xmath70 ( 3.083mev ) , @xmath71 ( 4.264mev ) , @xmath72 ( 6.957mev ) , @xmath73 ( 7.328mev ) , where the value in the parenthesis is its hartree energy .",
    "naturally , strengths of those low - lying states are discrete and have no width . the width shown in the figure",
    "is obtained by expanding with a lorentzian factor @xmath59 mev in this calculation .",
    "it should be mentioned that the pairs formed from the states in the fermi sea and dirac sea has negligible contribution to the hartree strength , but play an important role in the coherent strength , which is discussed in more detail in refs.@xcite .    in fig.2(b )",
    "we show the correlated strength of the isgor for @xmath0sn .",
    "the strengths are pushed down by the residual particle - hole interaction through the meson exchanges , which clearly show a collectivity in the rrpa strength .",
    "the leor with @xmath74 excitations for @xmath0sn is located at @xmath75 and the heor with @xmath76 excitations is identified as peaks around 27 - 38 mev . since we are working on the nonspectral rpa representation , it is difficult to analyze the detail contribution to the rpa strength from various configurations . in order to make a clear analysis it is necessary to reformulate and work in the configuration space , which are our future works . in comparison with the strengths in fig.2(a )",
    "it is interesting to notice that some strengths , for example the strength at the energy around 21 mev , are missing in the dashed curve , which are not produced from resonant - states , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "those strengths are not changed in the rrpa strength , see in fig .",
    "it is clearly shown that those states do not contribute to the coherent interaction and the strength remains at the same position as the hartree strength .",
    "for the coherent rrpa strengths both methods give similar results .",
    "the one in the simple method including only resonant - states in the continuum produces main features of giant resonances at the energy below 40 mev .",
    "it characterizes not only the landau width , but also the single particle escaping width , which may be rigorously described by the continuum rrpa@xcite .",
    "the results illustrate that the contribution from the continuum to the coherent strength in giant resonances is mainly from those single particle resonances .",
    "in a summary , we have studied energies , widths and wave functions of single particle resonant - states in the continuum for @xmath0sn using the s - matrix method based on the rmf with the parameter set nl3 .",
    "the scattering dirac wave functions are calculated with a proper asymptotic scattering boundary condition .",
    "the relativistic coulomb wave functions are investigated , which are different from the non - relativistic ones , but the deviations are small for the light and even intermediate heavy nuclei .",
    "the single - particle resonance state in the continuum is defined when its scattering phase shift passes through @xmath4 in the s - matrix .",
    "it shows that the s - matrix method is a straightforward and feasible way in the determination of single - particle resonances .",
    "the single particle resonances in the continuum play an important role in the description of the nuclear dynamical processes , such as the collective giant resonances . in the framework of fully consistent rrpa",
    ", the isgor of @xmath0sn can be well described by the simple method where the continuum replaced by only single particle resonances . with this simple method",
