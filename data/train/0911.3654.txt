    "dwarf elliptical ( de ) galaxies are characterized by low surface brightness ( @xmath10 mag arcsec@xmath11 ) , little to no gas , and old to intermediate age stellar populations .",
    "these galaxies are spatially clustered and account for more than 75% of objects",
    "brighter than @xmath12 in nearby galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "since there are few , if any , isolated de galaxies , most proposed de galaxy formation scenarios are environmentally - driven , such as via gas stripping or gravitational harassment of gas - rich spiral or dwarf irregular galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recent evidence for embedded stellar disks and bars in some des support these scenarios @xcite .",
    "since gas - rich systems have significant rotation velocities , a key test of this hypothesis class is comparing the kinematics of de and gas - rich galaxies .",
    "internal kinematic measurements for des in the fornax and virgo cluster have revealed an unexpected dichotomy : roughly half of the observed des have significant rotation about the major - axis , while the remaining galaxies show no detectable major - axis rotation @xcite .",
    "de galaxies with no rotation present a challenge to any scenario in which de progenitors are gas - rich and thus rotating @xcite .",
    "ram pressure stripping alone does not affect the kinematics of the collisionless stellar component .",
    "gravitational processes such as galaxy harassment can reduce the amount of rotational angular momentum , converting this into random velocity dispersion , however , simulations are unable to completely remove rotational support @xcite .    because des have low surface brightnesses , integrated light ( long - slit ) kinematic observations of des in both galaxy clusters and the local group",
    "are currently limited to within the half - light effective radius ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "thus , it is possible that significant rotational angular momentum lies at larger distances than has so far been explored . addressing this question",
    "requires kinematics tracers at larger radius . while the dynamics of de globular cluster systems suggest that there may be significant rotation at large radius @xcite , the small number of clusters limits the usefulness of this tracer .",
    "the des in the local group share the same general properties as the more numerous des in galaxy clusters , however , their proximity allows us to resolve individual stars @xcite , and thus trace kinematics profiles down to arbitrarily low surface brightness and large radius .",
    "the local group contains three de galaxies , ngc  205 , ngc  147 and ngc  185 , which in addition to the compact elliptical m32 , are the brightest satellites around the spiral galaxy m31 .",
    "we follow the terminology conventions of , e.g.  @xcite , although alternatives are in use . while the differing terminologies can be confusing , the key point is that ngc  205 , ngc  147 , and ngc  185 on the one hand , and m32 on the other hand , should not be grouped in a single class .",
    "the former three galaxies have fundamental plane properties that indicate similarity to galaxies in the dwarf spheroidal class ( dsph ) .",
    "by contrast , galaxies such as m32 have properties that indicate similarity to ( giant ) elliptical galaxies .",
    "this likely indicates a difference in formation history , as discussed more fully in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the prototype of the de galaxy class is ngc  205 which is in very close projection to m31 ( @xmath14kpc ) .",
    "both photometric and kinematic evidence suggests that ngc  205 is tidally interacting with m31 @xcite , and may in fact be on its first orbital approach @xcite .",
    "in contrast , ngc  147 and ngc  185 lie at a projected distance of @xmath15(@xmath16@xmath17kpc ) from m31 .",
    "while the metal - poor stellar halo of m31 extends to this distance @xcite , its gravitational influence of m31 is not expected to influence the kinematics of these de satellites ( see  [ subsec_bound ] ) .",
    "ngc  147 and ngc  185 are separated from each other by merely @xmath18 , leading to speculation that they may be a bound galaxy pair @xcite .",
    "an accurate distance estimate suggests that these two galaxies are physically separated by over 60kpc @xcite and may not be bound ( however , see  [ subsec_bound ] ) .",
    "the large observed distances between these two des and their parent m31 , combined with their relative proximity to the sun , make ngc  147 and ngc  185 the best available targets for studying the properties of de galaxies to large radius .",
    "ngc  147 and ngc  185 share several similar fundamental properties , such as absolute luminosity ( @xmath19 ) , half - light radius ( @xmath20kpc ) , and central velocity dispersion ( for exact values see table  1 ) .",
    "however , they differ markedly in many aspects .",
    "ngc  185 contains some gas , dust and evidence for recent star formation confined to its center @xcite , while ngc  147 is devoid of gas or dust and shows no sign of recent star formation activity @xcite .",
    "an average metallicity of [ fe / h ] = @xmath21 is inferred for ngc  185 @xcite , while a more metal rich population of [ fe / h ] = @xmath22 is inferred for ngc  147 @xcite .",
    "hst / wfpc2 imaging of both galaxies also implies the presence of intermediate - age stars , with ngc  147 having a more significant contribution than ngc  185 @xcite .",
    "thus , while both des are dominated by old to intermediate - age stars , the metallicity and age mixture of these components are different in each galaxy .",
    "the first spectroscopic long - slit observations of local group des by @xcite suggested that while ngc  185 appeared supported entirely by random motions , ngc  147 had a significant rotational component of @xmath23 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "somewhat deeper observations by @xcite extended the kinematic profiles out @xmath24 ( 1@xmath13 ) , but did not measure a significant rotation for either galaxy .",
    "in contrast , both studies measured a rotational component in ngc  205 ( within the tidal radius ) , later confirmed by @xcite to be @xmath25 km  s@xmath2 . using the simien & prugniel data , @xcite constructed dynamical models for all three local group des , concluding that , within the half - light radii , all three galaxies have mass - to - light ratios above that expected from the stellar populations alone .    in this paper , we present accurate radial velocities out to 8@xmath13 in the local group de galaxies ngc  147 and ngc  185 , based on keck / deimos multi - slit spectroscopy for 520 and 442  red giant branch ( rgb ) stars , respectively .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  [ sec_data ] we discuss target selection for our deimos slitmasks , the observing procedure and data reduction . in  [ sec_results ] , we discuss the velocity , velocity dispersion and metallicity profiles . in  [ sec_model ]",
    ", we construct two - integral dynamical models for these galaxies and discuss the best fit mass distribution and dark matter content .",
    "finally , in  [ sec_disc ] , we discuss the implications of these results for the formation of de galaxies .    throughout this paper",
    "we adopt distance moduli determined by @xcite via the tip of the rgb method .",
    "the distance modulus for ngc  147 is @xmath26 ( @xmath27kpc ) and ngc  185 is @xmath28 ( @xmath29kpc ) .",
    "this places ngc  147 and ngc  185 at projected distances of 140 and 185kpc from their parent galaxy m31 , respectively .",
    "individual stars in ngc  147 and ngc  185 were targeted for spectroscopy according to their probability of being a rgb star based on canada - france - hawaii telescope cfh12k mosaic imaging in the @xmath30- and @xmath31-bands @xcite .",
    "the ccd mosaic covers a @xmath32 region centered on each galaxy with @xmath33 pixels .",
    "stellar photometry from these images extends 2mag below the tip of the rgb .",
    "the spatial distribution of stars is shown in figure  [ fig_dss ] .",

    "the absolute magnitude of the rgb for a metal - poor stellar population is @xmath34 . at the assumed distance and reddening of ngc  147 and ngc  185",
    ", the apparent magnitude of the rgb population is @xmath35 ( see figure  [ fig_cmd ] ) . since internal metallicity variations will cause a spread in the colors of rgb stars , we select spectroscopic targets based primarily on apparent magnitude rather than color .",
    "we note there is a 0.1 - 0.2mag photometric zero - point error between individual ccd chips in the cfht photometry which we discovered after our spectroscopic observations were completed . while this led us to use an alternative dataset to determine the surface brightness profiles in  [ ss : prof ] , the error had little to no affect on our targeting efficiencies .    for both des , highest priority in the spectroscopic target list",
    "was assigned to stars between @xmath36 .",
    "second priority was given to stars between @xmath37 and @xmath38 ; lowest priority was assigned to objects @xmath39 . to minimize galactic foreground contamination , targets were required to have @xmath40 .",
    "stars with photometric errors larger than @xmath41 were rejected , as were stars having neighbors of equal or greater brightness within a radius @xmath42 .",
    "the photometric criteria used for spectroscopic target selection are shown in figure  [ fig_cmd ] .",
    "slitmasks were created using the deimos dsimulator slitmask design software . for each slitmask",
    "the software fills in the mask area to the extent possible with the highest priority input targets .",
    "it then fills in the remaining space on the slitmask with lower priority targets .",
    "the specifics of each mask are listed in table  2 .",
    "the data were taken with the keck  ii 10-m telescope and the deimos spectrograph @xcite .",

    "five masks were observed in ngc  185 on september 16 , 2006 .",

    "the spatial scale is @xmath46  per pixel and slitlets were @xmath47 wide .",
    "the minimum slit length was @xmath48 which allows adequate sky subtraction ; the minimum spatial separation between slit ends was @xmath49 ( three pixels ) .",
    "spectra were reduced using a modified version of the spec2d software pipeline ( version  1.1.4 ) developed by the deep2 team at the university of california - berkeley for that survey .",
    "a detailed description of the two - dimensional reductions can be found in @xcite .",
    "the final one - dimensional spectra are rebinned into logarithmic wavelength bins with 15 km  s@xmath2  per pixel .",
    "an example deimos spectrum taken with the same settings is shown in figure  4 of @xcite .",
    "radial velocities were measured by cross - correlating the observed science spectra with a series of high signal - to - noise stellar templates .",
    "stellar templates were observed with keck / deimos using the same setup as described in  [ subsec_redux ] and cover a wide range of stellar types ( f8 to m8 giants , subgiants and dwarf stars ) and metallicities ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath50 to @xmath51 ) .",
    "we calculate and apply a telluric correction to each science spectrum by cross correlating a hot stellar template with the night sky absorption lines following the method in @xcite .",
    "the telluric correction accounts for the velocity error due to mis - centering the star within the @xmath47 slit caused by small mask rotations or astrometric errors .",
    "we apply both a telluric and heliocentric correction to all velocities presented in this paper .",
    "we determine the random component of our velocity errors using a monte carlo bootstrap method .",
    "noise is added to each pixel in the one - dimensional science spectrum , we then recalculate the velocity and telluric correction for 1000 noise realizations .",
    "error bars are defined as the square root of the variance in the recovered mean velocity in the monte carlo simulations . the systematic contribution to the velocity error",
    "was determined by @xcite to be 2.2 km  s@xmath2  based on repeated independent measurements of individual stars .",
    "the systematic error contribution is expected to be constant as the spectrograph setup and velocity cross - correlation routines are identical .",
    "we add the random and systematic errors in quadrature to arrive at the final velocity error for each science measurement .",
    "radial velocities were successfully measured for 1227 of the 1483 extracted spectra across the nine observed deimos masks . the majority of spectra for which we could not measure a redshift did not have sufficient signal - to - noise .",
    "the fitted velocities were visually inspected to ensure reliability .",
    "the expected velocity distributions of ngc  147 and ngc  185 overlap with both the stellar velocity distribution of the m31 halo and the foreground milky way disk and halo .",
    "thus , a simple velocity cut is not sufficient to define membership in these de galaxies .",
    "we determine membership in ngc  147 and ngc  185 using a modified version of the probability method of @xcite .",
    "this method computes a membership probability for each star based on the assumption that de stars have different physical properties than the contaminating foreground and background populations .",
    "the @xcite method computes the probability that a given star is either a rgb star at the distance of ngc  147 or ngc  185 , or a foreground milky way dwarf star based on the star s location in four spectroscopic and photometric diagnostics : line of sight velocity , strength of the surface - gravity sensitive na ii absorption line at @xmath52 , position in a color - magnitude diagram , and a comparison of photometric ( cmd - based ) and spectroscopic ( based on the ca ii triplet at @xmath53 ) metallicity estimates .",
    "a star s position in a diagnostic is compared to probability distribution functions based on appropriate training sets to determine the likelihood the star is a rgb or foreground dwarf star .",
    "the likelihoods from the individual diagnostics are then combined to produce an overall likelihood .    for the present analysis",
    ", several modifications were made to the method published in @xcite , which was optimized to identify red giant branch stars in the halo of m31 .",
    "several of the diagnostics utilize johnson - cousins @xmath54 and @xmath31 magnitudes , while the de photometry was taken in the @xmath30 and @xmath31 bands .",
    "the cmd diagnostic and spectroscopic versus photometric metallicity diagnostic were re - derived using @xcite isochrones in ( @xmath31 , @xmath55 ) shifted to the distance of each de . to utilize the na ii diagnostic , vandenberg isochrones were used to define a relation between @xmath55 and @xmath56 , which was then used to derive a @xmath56 color for each star .",
    "the velocity distribution of each de is modeled as a gaussian , with a constant velocity dispersion and a central velocity that varies with distance along the semi - major axis .",
    "we expect little contamination from m31 halo stars at these radii ( @xmath571 star per mask ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "stars that are more than three times more likely to be a red giant branch star at the distance of the de than a foreground dwarf star , and which have a spatial position and line - of - sight velocity consistent with that of the de , are classified as members . given these membership criteria , we identify 520 and 442 rgb star as members of the de galaxies ngc  147 and ngc  185 , respectively . velocities and velocities errors for individual member stars are listed in tables  6 and 7 in the electronic version of the paper , or on request from the authors .    0.25 cm",
    "the measured velocities of individual stars allow us to probe the dynamics of ngc  147 and ngc  185 to much larger radius than possible via integrated - light spectroscopy . in order to compare to previous results , and to construct dynamical models ,",
    "we bin the individual velocity measurements based on their major - axis distance @xmath58 , using bin widths @xmath59 for ngc  147 and @xmath60 for ngc  185 .",
    "the bin widths were chosen to roughly match the effective radius of each de . the bin with integer index number @xmath61 spans values of @xmath58 from @xmath62 to @xmath63 .",
    "the value of @xmath58 for each star was calculated using spherical trigonometry and a zenithal projection , using the galaxy center positions and major axis position angles ( table  1 and 3 ) ; positive radii lie on the north - east side of each galaxy .",

    "the systemic velocity for ngc  147 is @xmath73 km  s@xmath2  and @xmath74 km  s@xmath2  for ngc  185 .",
    "this is consistent with literature values from @xcite and the velocity compilation from the nasa extragalactic database .    to further improve the signal - to - noise ratio we folded the profiles above by taking the weighted average of bins on opposite sides of the galaxy ( i.e. , bins @xmath61 and @xmath75 ) , using the expected anti - symmetry and symmetry of the rotation and dispersion profiles , respectively .",

    "fitting a simple straight line to our inner data points , we predict a rotation velocity of merely 0.8 km  s@xmath2  at this radius for ngc  185 , well below the observational errors of both @xcite and @xcite , and fully consistent with their conclusion of no rotation . for ngc  147",
    ", we predict a rotation velocity of 4.3 km  s@xmath2  within @xmath81 .",

    "our discovery of rotation at radii larger than @xmath13 has significant implications for studies of more distant de galaxies .",
    "we will discuss this issue further below and in ",
    "[ sec_disc ] .",

    "values less than unity imply anisotropic - support .",
    "using the measured ellipticity of each de ( table  1 ) , the measured maximum rotation velocity and the average velocity dispersion values from above , we compute @xmath84 for ngc  147 and @xmath85 for ngc  185 . because our observed maximum rotational velocities are lower limits on the true maximum rotation , these @xmath82 values are also lower limits to the true values . for the third de in the local group , ngc  205 , we measured @xmath86 in @xcite .",
    "the original value for ngc  205 may have been somewhat larger given that the outer parts of this galaxy have been tidal disrupted by interactions with m31 .",
    "thus , while the majority of kinematic support for the observed shapes of the local group de galaxies comes from rotation , some anisotropic velocity dispersions are needed to fully explain the observed shapes .",

    "the underlying reason for this may be that ngc  185 has an increasing @xmath92 with radius , as suggested by figure  [ f : kin ] .",

    "this is not as high as observed , so for the chabrier imf one must invoke the presence of non - baryonic dark matter to fit the observed @xmath154 values .",
    "the salpeter imf tracks , while closer to the observations , are only marginally consistent with observations for very old stellar populations .",
    "stellar population studies suggest significant intermediate age stellar populations in both des @xcite , thus the salpeter imf also implies the presence of dark matter .",

    "is also revealed by plots of the fundamental plane ; see e.g. the plot of @xmath165 vs.  @xmath166 in geha et al .",
    "a traditional interpretation of this is that it indicates a fundamental distinction between dwarf and giant ellipticals .",
    "however , graham & guzman ( 2003 ) have proposed more recently that there is actually a continuous sequence between the two , with the upturn in @xmath92 towards de galaxies driven by the fact that their sersic @xmath167 parameter is lower than for giant ellipticals . either way , it is clear from figure  [ f : mlsig ] that de galaxies have @xmath92 values that are similar to those of intermediate- to high - luminosity giant ellipticals .",
    "the latter are redder and have higher metallicity ( and quite possibly older stellar populations ) than ngc 147 and ngc 185 .",
    "a natural explanation for the observed @xmath92 of ngc  147 and ngc  185 is that these galaxies have a significant dark matter component , consistent with our conclusions from the comparison to population synthesis models .",

    "approximating our de galaxies as point masses , we calculate the criteria for these two objects to be bound as @xmath173 .",
    "this criteria suggests that , in the absence of transverse motion , ngc  147 and ngc  185 are a gravitationally bound pair , in agreement with @xcite .",

    "however , these calculations do not preclude the possibility of past tidal interactions , either between these two galaxies or with m31 , and it is yet possible that there are unbound stars in our kinematic sample .",
    "the regularity and bi - symmetry of our kinematic data for ngc  147 suggest that any contamination is minimal . in ngc  185",
    ", the upturn of @xmath76 profile over our models at large radius may either be interpreted as an increasing @xmath92 ratio with radius , or possible tidal contamination .",

    "the profiles represent the most extensive spectroscopic radial coverage for any de galaxy , extending to a projected distance of eight half - light radii ( @xmath177 ) .",
    "contrary to previous results , we find that both des have significant rotation velocities which contributes to the observed flattened shapes of each galaxy .",

    "our modeling estimates @xmath92 ratios of @xmath8 and @xmath9 for ngc  147 and ngc  185 , respectively , which is in excess of that expected from stellar populations alone .",
    "thus , some dark matter is required to fully explain the observe kinematics .",
    "the mean velocity profiles of ngc  147 and ngc  185 suggest that rotation may be far more prevalent in de galaxies than previously assumed .",
    "we conclude that these local group des are rotationally - supported , however , if placed at the distance of the virgo or fornax clusters , integrated - light observations such as those of @xcite would have concluded that these des have little to no rotation .",
    "it is not guaranteed that the local group de galaxies had similar formation mechanisms as those residing in the much denser environments of , e.g. , the virgo or fornax clusters . however , this is certainly plausible , given that these galaxies share similar fundamental plane properties , as defined by the photometric and kinematic properties inside @xmath13 ( see e.g. , fig 7 ) .",
    "our results then indicate that cluster des may also have significant rotation velocities that are manifest only at larger radii than current observations allow .",

    "<S> we present kinematic and metallicity profiles for the m31 dwarf elliptical ( de ) satellite galaxies ngc  147 and ngc  185 . </S>",
    "<S> the profiles represent the most extensive spectroscopic radial coverage for any de galaxy , extending to a projected distance of eight half - light radii ( @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we achieve this coverage via keck / deimos multislit spectroscopic observations of 520 and 442  member red giant branch stars in ngc  147 and ngc  185 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to previous studies , we find that both des have significant internal rotation . </S>",
    "<S> we measure a maximum rotational velocity of @xmath1 km  s@xmath2  for ngc  147 and @xmath3 km  s@xmath2  for ngc  185 . while both rotation profiles suggest a flattening in the outer regions , </S>",
    "<S> there is no indication that we have reached the radius of maximum rotation velocity . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity dispersions decrease gently with radius with an average dispersion of @xmath4 km  s@xmath2  for ngc  147 and @xmath5 km  s@xmath2  for ngc  185 . </S>",
    "<S> the average metallicity for ngc  147 is [ fe / h ] = @xmath6 and for ngc  185 is [ fe / h ] = @xmath7 ; both des have internal metallicity dispersions of 0.5dex , but show no evidence for a radial metallicity gradient . </S>",
    "<S> we construct two - integral axisymmetric dynamical models and find that the observed kinematical profiles can not be explained without modest amounts of non - baryonic dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> we measure central mass - to - light ratios of @xmath8 and @xmath9 for ngc  147 and ngc  185 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> both de galaxies are consistent with being primarily flattened by their rotational motions , although some anisotropic velocity dispersion is needed to fully explain their observed shapes . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity profiles of all three local group des ( ngc  147 , ngc  185 and ngc  205 ) suggest that rotation is more prevalent in the de galaxy class than previously assumed , but is often manifest only at several times the effective radius . </S>",
    "<S> since all des outside the local group have been probed to only inside the effective radius , this opens the door for formation mechanisms in which des are transformed or stripped versions of gas - rich rotating progenitor galaxies . </S>"
