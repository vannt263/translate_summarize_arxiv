    "in the last two decades , high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) has been widely studied for its potential as a short - wavelength tabletop light source  @xcite , or as an ultrashort attosecond pulse or pulse train @xcite .",
    "the harmonic emission in a gas medium is well understood qualitatively .",
    "harmonics are emitted when atoms or molecules are exposed to an intense infrared laser field .",
    "these lights travel collinearly with the input laser and interact with the generating medium .",
    "thus a full description of hhg involves a quantum treatment of the harmonic emission from a single atom or molecule , together with the propagation of the harmonics and the nonlinear interaction of the laser light with the medium .",
    "recently , jin _",
    "@xcite have combined the well - established propagation theory with the quantitative rescattering ( qrs ) theory @xcite for individual atoms and molecules , to provide a quantitative description of hhg generated from atomic and molecular targets by an intense laser pulse .",
    "its success has been shown by comparing with the recent experimental measurements @xcite .",
    "these applications have focused on the region where the fundamental laser field is not severely modified in the medium .",
    "such studies are useful for using hhg to probe the structure of molecules . for applications , it is desirable to achieve highest number of photons by increasing the laser intensity and the gas pressure .",
    "if the hhg from individual atoms are fully phase - matched , then the number of photons will increase quadratically with the medium pressure .",
    "unfortunately , the nonlinear interaction of lasers with the gas medium is complicated .",
    "the intense laser light and the harmonics can be dispersed and absorbed by the medium .",
    "the intense laser light also ionizes the atoms ( or molecules ) and generates free electrons , thus changing the optical properties of the gas medium",
    ". these nonlinear interactions of the laser light and the harmonics with the medium can be calculated by solving the proper maxwell s wave equations , with the induced dipole from each atom or molecule by the laser as the source of the harmonics .",
    "a detailed theory of harmonic generation with the inclusion of macroscopic propagation where single - atom hhg emissions are calculated with the qrs theory has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    "our goal is to extend this theory to the harmonic generation for laser intensities near and above the critical intensity for a given target . in particular , we want to investigate the effect of pressure on the yield of hhg , as the intensity is varied or when the focusing conditions are changed . at high intensities , hhg is a highly nonlinear process , and the harmonic yields are very sensitive to all the parameters of the experiment .",
    "these parameters , unfortunately , are not always well specified in an experiment .",
    "we perform simulations by varying some parameters in order to achieve optimal agreement with the reported experimental data .",
    "we also check the effects of various parameters of the medium to illustrate how these individual parameters change the simulated hhg spectra .",
    "these kinds of studies have been carried out previously , sometimes connecting with experimental observations . however , in these calculations hhg from each atom was often calculated using the strong field approximation ( sfa ) , or the so - called lewenstein model @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the sfa does not predict correct hhg spectra from individual atoms . by using qrs ,",
    "the atomic dipoles induced by the laser are accurately calculated .",
    "these induced dipoles are then fed into the maxwell s propagation equations .",
    "we perform simulations to check to what extent some of the earlier experimental hhg spectra can be simulated with the present theory .    in section",
    "[ theory ] , we briefly summarize how the calculations are done .",
    "we then simulate the hhg spectra of ar for 6-fs pulses at quite high intensity reported in ref .",
    "we also examine the effect of gas pressure on the behavior of cooper minimum at high intensities . for higher pressure the laser field",
    "is severely modified as it propagates through the medium .",
    "we show that the cooper minimum eventually disappears at pressure above about 50 torr .",
    "the disappearance of the cooper minimum is entirely due to the medium propagation effect @xcite .",
    "next we examine the pressure effect on the harmonics , and it is established in general that there is an optimum pressure for each harmonic beyond which the harmonic yield drops with increasing pressure .",
    "since the propagation of harmonics is controlled by the optical properties of the medium , we check if there is a single factor that would mostly affect the harmonic generation .",
    "we also take a close look at the dispersion and absorption coefficients used in the simulation .",
    "these tabulated data , which were obtained from theoretical calculations , have not been carefully calibrated and should be used with caution .",
    "finally we examine the propagation of hhg generated in ne at high intensity and high gas pressure to compare with the result reported in a recent experiment @xcite .",
    "we have found that in this case hhg spectra are very sensitive to the experimental parameters such that simulation can only achieve qualitative agreement .",
    "the detailed description of the theoretical method used in the calculation can be found in ref .",
    "briefly , we consider both the propagation of the fundamental and the harmonic fields in an ionizing medium . for the fundamental field ,",
    "we include dispersion , absorption , kerr , and plasma effects . for the harmonics ,",
    "the dispersion and absorption due to neutral atoms are included .",
    "the induced dipoles for single atoms are obtained using the qrs theory @xcite : @xmath0 here @xmath1 is the wave packet calculated from the lewenstein model @xcite , normalized by the tunneling ionization rate calculated using the ammosov - delone - krainov ( adk ) theory @xcite . the transition dipole moment @xmath2 is obtained by treating the real atom in a single - active electron approximation . for the argon target used in the present work ,",
    "@xmath2 is calculated by using the model potential given by mller @xcite . for ne",
    ", the model potential takes the form given in refs .",
    "the resulting induced dipoles for hundreds of different peak intensities are then fed into maxwell s wave equations .",
    "we assume that the laser beam at the entrance of the gas jet has the gaussian shape both in time and space .",
    "the harmonics emitted at the exit face of the gas jet may propagate further in free space until they are detected .",
    "thus the harmonic spectra observed experimentally also depend on the detecting conditions @xcite . in this paper , except for one case to be described below , all the harmonic signals ( i.e. , the total signal ) from the exit of the medium are collected .",
    "-0 mm    we first simulate experimental hhg spectra of ar generated by a 760-nm and 6-fs ( fwhm ) laser pulse reported in @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the gas jet was placed 2 mm after the laser focus .",
    "the confocal parameter of the laser beam was 10 mm ( the beam waist was 34.8 @xmath3 m if a gaussian beam is assumed ) .",
    "the laser intensity at the focus was estimated to be 6@xmath410@xmath5 w@xmath6@xmath7 . in simulation-1",
    ", we use the gas - jet width of 1 mm , and the gas pressure is 40 torr .",
    "we find that a laser peak intensity of 4.5@xmath410@xmath5 w@xmath6@xmath7 would give better agreement with the spectra in the cutoff region .",
    "the calculations have been carried out for different carrier - envelope phases ( ceps ) since a short 6-fs laser pulse was applied in the experiment .",
    "the theoretical spectra are finally averaged over all the ceps . to compare with experiment ,",
    "the hhg spectra are normalized at harmonic 27 ( h27 ) .",
    "we can see that the main features in the experimental spectra are well reproduced by simulation-1 . however , the overall slope of the harmonic yields is not the same .",
    "the simulated harmonic yields are too low for lower orders , but too high for higher orders . but this result is already a great improvement over the theoretical simulation reported in fig .",
    "4(c ) of ref . @xcite .",
    "since hhg spectra are sensitive to experimental conditions , we thus make another simulation where the gas - jet length is extended to 2 mm and the laser intensity is reduced to 4.0@xmath410@xmath5 w@xmath6@xmath7 . in this simulation-2 ,",
    "other parameters are the same as those in simulation-1 .",
    "we can see that simulation-2 gives better agreement for the low harmonics up to h27 , but the slope for higher harmonics is still not reproduced correctly .",
    "we have made further adjustment of the laser parameters within the capability of our present code but were unable to improve agreement . at present our code",
    "is limited to a gaussian ( spatial ) input pulse . in the experiment of altucci _",
    "@xcite , the laser was coupled into an argon - filled capillary consisting of a 60-cm - long fiber whose spatial profile would be the bessel function . thus the emerged 6-fs pulse may be closer to a truncated bessel beam .",
    "it remains to be seen if the discrepancy can be removed if a truncated bessel beam is assumed for the input pulse   @xcite .",
    "below we aim at investigating the gas pressure effects on the hhg spectra .",
    "-0 mm    in figs .",
    "[ fig2](a ) and [ fig2](b ) we show the macroscopic hhg spectra of ar for four different gas pressures : 10 , 30 , 50 , and 80 torr , at a laser intensity of 5@xmath410@xmath5 w@xmath6@xmath7 at focus for cep=0 and cep averaged , respectively .",
    "the other parameters are the same as those in simulation-1 of fig .",
    "since a few - cycle pulse is used , the harmonic spectra show a strong cep dependence in the cutoff region .",
    "after cep average the spectra become very smooth .",
    "there are two additional features in figs .",
    "[ fig2](a ) and [ fig2](b ) that warrant further discussions .",
    "the first is about the well - known cooper minimum ( cm ) of the hhg in ar .",
    "although cm in harmonic spectra is a signature of the electronic structure of the ar atom @xcite , previous experimental studies have shown that the  visibility \" of cm is sensitive to experimental conditions .",
    "for example , the position of the gas jet @xcite and the gas pressure @xcite could wash out the cm seen in the harmonic spectra .",
    "it has also been pointed out by jin _",
    "_ @xcite that the cm also depends on how the hhg spectra are measured , i.e. , in the near or the far fields , with or without the slit .",
    "the present simulations show a similar cm dependence on gas pressure , which has been observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , although the experiment was performed under different conditions ( laser duration was @xmath850 fs , and the laser intensity was @xmath82.8@xmath410@xmath5 w@xmath6@xmath7 ) . in figs .",
    "[ fig2](a ) and [ fig2](b ) , there appears an obvious minimum around 31st harmonic ( @xmath851 ev ) below 30 torr .",
    "when the pressure is increased to 50 torr , the minimum becomes barely visible , and then it is totally washed out when the pressure is increased to 80 torr . according to the qrs @xcite",
    ", these variations are attributed to the change of the macroscopic wave packet ( mwp ) .",
    "the qrs states that the macroscopic hhg spectrum can be expressed as @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the mwp , which reflects the effect of laser and experimental conditions , and @xmath11 is the photorecombination ( pr ) transition dipole moment , which is a property of the target only . in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) we show the detailed comparison of the mwps at four gas pressures for cep=0 .",
    "it shows that the mwp ( @xmath12 ) varies with the gas pressure . around photon energy of 50 ev ( @xmath8h31 ) ,",
    "the mwp is very flat at 10 torr . with increasing gas pressure",
    "it becomes more steeper .",
    "meanwhile , we also show the pr transition dipole moment @xmath13 for reference .",
    "it is concluded that the rapid change of the mwp around 50 ev causes the disappearance of the cm in the hhg spectra .",
    "the second feature in fig .  [ fig2 ] is the spectral modulation . in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , for harmonics above the cm , the spectra modulation is large at 10 torr . the spectra are less modulated at 30 and 50 torr , and become almost continuous when the gas pressure is increased to 80 torr .",
    "these continuous hhg spectra could be used to produce isolated attosecond pulses ( iaps ) with a cep - stabilized laser .",
    "note that the continuum structure in hhg spectra of xe has been discussed by jin _",
    "_ @xcite recently [ see fig . 1 in that paper ] .",
    "they found that reshaping ( blue shift and defocusing ) of the fundamental laser field was responsible for these phenomena , and they also showed a method to produce an iap by spatial filtering in the far field . to check this mechanism in our situation",
    ", we show the evolution of the on - axis electric field at the entrance and exit of the gas jet for 10 torr and 80 torr in fig .",
    "[ fig2](d ) .",
    "note that the time is defined in the moving coordinate frame  @xcite .",
    "the ionization probability is very high ( about 61@xmath14 at the end of a laser pulse with peak intensity of 4.63@xmath410@xmath5 w@xmath6@xmath7 ) .",
    "the electric field has a good gaussian form at the entrance . in the leading edge of laser pulse , where the ionization probability is very small as seen in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2](d ) , the electric field at the exit face has a small shift with respect to the one at the entrance .",
    "this shift is originally from the geometric phase due to the tightly focused laser beam . in the falling edge",
    ", there is an obvious blue shift , and the electric field at 80 torr is much reduced than that at 10 torr .",
    "we can conclude that the fundamental laser field is reshaped .",
    "combined with effects due to cep average , our simulations in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) show that spectral modulation above the cm increases from 10 torr to 30 torr , and then decreases with increasing gas pressure until the hhg spectra become continuous at 80 torr .",

    "-0 mm      the macroscopic harmonic generation is strongly influenced by many factors collectively . in other words ,",

    "there are more free electrons generated and thus the fundamental laser is more defocused as the pressure is increased .",
    "the inset shows that the relative yield at the higher pressure is reduced , indicating that hhg generated at higher pressure is more divergent .",
    "in summary , we have used the recently developed quantitative rescattering ( qrs ) theory for the generation of high - order harmonics of individual atoms with the inclusion of the propagation of the laser and the harmonics in the gas medium to obtain macroscopic hhg spectra that can be compared directly with experimental observations .",
    "we have studied the effect of the gas pressure on the yields of the harmonics .",
    "the gas pressure affects harmonics through frequency - dependent properties of the medium such as dispersion , absorption , nonlinear kerr effect , and plasma density , as well as the phase - matching conditions . in the meanwhile ,",
    "the fundamental laser field is modified as it propagates through the medium .",
    "the modification is especially severe when the incident laser reaches the intensity near or above the critical intensity for a given target . from the simulations",
    ", we have found that hhg spectra are very sensitive to the laser focusing conditions . by starting with the qrs theory instead of the sfa for the single - atom response",
    ", we have been able to obtain hhg spectra that are much closer to experimental observations , but we are still unable to obtain hhg spectra that are in perfect agreement with the data .",
    "this is in contrast with our recent positive results @xcite where hhg of atoms and molecules were generated at lower intensities .",
    "we have attributed the lack of good agreement to the strong dependence of the hhg spectra on the laser parameters when experiments are carried out at high intensities and that these parameters are difficult to specify accurately in a given experiment . in the future , it is desirable that experiments report hhg spectra taken at various focusing conditions and gas pressures in order to establish if our current theory of hhg is under solid ground in the high - intensity and high - gas - pressure regime .",
    "this regime is important in order to generate high - energy harmonics near and above the water window using mid - infrared lasers , as well as the possible generation of few - cycle single attosecond pulses in the soft x - ray region @xcite .",

    "<S> we study the effect of gas pressure on the generation of high - order harmonics where harmonics due to individual atoms are calculated using the recently developed quantitative rescattering theory , and the propagation of the laser and harmonics in the medium is calculated by solving the maxwell s wave equation . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate that the simulated spectra are very sensitive to the laser focusing conditions at high laser intensity and high pressure since the fundamental laser field is severely reshaped during the propagation . by comparing the simulated results with several experiments we show that the pressure dependence can be qualitatively explained . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of quantitative agreement is tentatively attributed to the failure of the complete knowledge of the experimental conditions . </S>"
