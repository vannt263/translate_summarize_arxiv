    "the imposed displacement has lowered the @xmath105 symmetry of the supercell , permitting transitions between states below and above the fermi level which were previously labeled as @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the energies of the mn @xmath8 states do not alter much ( less than 0.04 ev ) for small distortions ( 0.016  ) and the induced dipole matrix elements are linear with oxygen distortion .",

    "this accuracy is limited by four factors : ( 1 ) convergence of the lsda result ; ( 2 ) neglect of rotational distortions ; ( 3 ) simplification of magnetic structure to ferromagnetic ; and ( 4 ) applicability of lsda to strongly - correlated electrons .",
    "we tested the first by varying the number of plane waves used in the pseudopotential expansion .",
    "the answers reported here used a plane - wave cut - off @xmath127 ry . the value of @xmath102 increases by 9% at @xmath128 ry and decreases by 13% at @xmath129 ry , so the convergence error is estimated at 10% . sources ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) will causes errors of similar size , we believe .",
    "the biggest uncertainty is source ( 4 ) . in an unrelated dft study on the self - trapped - exciton in crystalline nacl @xcite",
    ", we found evidence that lsda incorrectly shifts the energy of localized states relative to delocalized states .",
    "however , the wavefunctions under consideration here are quite well - localized and agree qualitatively with expectation .",
    "therefore we do not believe that point ( 4 ) is the source of a major error .",
    "therefore we believe that this calculation provides firm evidence that phonon - activation is strong enough to account for the observation of @xmath3 to @xmath3 ( orbiton ) transitions in optical reflectivity , as we assumed in our previous work , and as we now use to predict raman spectra .",

    "@xmath134 one needs the expressions for overlap integrals of displaced harmonic oscillators , @xmath135 where @xmath136 is related to the jahn - teller gap as @xmath137 .",
    "the overlap @xmath138 for @xmath139 has the same expression as ( [ int1 ] ) with @xmath140 and @xmath141 interchanged and the sign of the displacement @xmath142 changed ( @xmath143 ) . when using expressions ( [ int1 ] , [ int2 ] ) , the signs of the @xmath144 , @xmath145 oxygens displacements are positive and @xmath146 , @xmath147 are negative , if @xmath51 ( reverse signs if @xmath53 ) and @xmath148 oxygens are undisplaced .",
    "evaluation of the overlap integrals @xmath149 is straightforward .",
    "for example , for the first order raman peak , only four one - phonon final states will contribute : @xmath150 with no contribution to the non - diagonal part of the tensor @xmath151 . for second- and third - order raman scattering ,",
    "four and eight final states contribute to the non - diagonal part of the tensor : @xmath152 the formulas for the diagonal parts of the higher - order raman tensors are more complicated and will not be given here .    to model the damping term @xmath73 of vibrational level @xmath153 , we use expression @xmath154 , as in a sequence of convolved gaussians , intended to mimic the local densities of phonon states on oxygen atoms .",
    "the value @xmath155 @xmath156 was taken . the raman cross section shown on fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] has a pronounced resonant behavior when the laser frequency @xmath60 approaches the orbiton energy @xmath157 .",
    "the first - order cross - section as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is underestimated , because we neglected coupling to higher electronic levels in eq .",
    "( [ absr ] ) , whose contribution to multiphonon peaks is probably negligible .",
    "the polarization dependence of the cross - section is only due to the dipole matrix element effect , namely @xmath158 , @xmath159 .",

    "even small deviations from eq .",
    "( [ gs1 ] ) might cause a noticeable change of the ratio @xmath162 from the value @xmath163 .",
    "therefore the predicted anisotropies of 4 and 16 for optical and raman spectra are not necessarily robust , but the relation @xmath164 should hold",
    ".    published raman measurements @xcite on undoped lamno@xmath0 do not extend to the multiphonon region and resonant behavior has not been tested experimentally .",
    "most experiments use the ar@xmath165 laser , for which frequency @xmath166 ev , we predict the multiphonon cross sections @xmath167 , @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 in units of @xmath171 sr@xmath172 .",
    "recently some features in raman spectra on lamno@xmath0 around 1100 @xmath156 were reported by several groups @xcite .",
    "these are probably the effect we are predicting .",
    "we advocate a picture of the orbitally ordered state of lamno@xmath0 where electron - phonon interactions ( in a context of large hund and hubbard energies ) have a major influence .",
    "our picture is disputed by other theorists @xcite .",
    "therefore we attempt here to provide predictions which can qualitatively distinguish our model from others . in our model ,",
    "the lowest electronic excitation is the 1.9 ev transition across the jahn - teller gap , modified by self - trapping to give a minimum gap half as large .",
    "this has successfully described the observed @xcite optical gap as a franck - condon broadened self - trapped exciton . the present paper uses density - functional theory to eliminate the need for a phenomenological coupling @xmath102 to account for this transition .    as a more stringent test",
    ", we here predict a new feature unique to the fc physics of the self - trapped exciton , namely a sequence of resonant multiphonon raman peaks .",
    "we predict the absolute values of the multiphonon raman cross section tensors",
    ".    a hot luminescence process can also give rise to a multiphonon peaks .",
    "incident light can excite an orbiton with a long lifetime which can recombine after vibrational energy @xmath173 being lost in the intermediate state through anharmonic interaction .",
    "the question whether the raman or hot luminescence mechanisms dominate the scattering intensity has an old history @xcite . in the raman case",
    "the intensity of the higher order peaks should decrease and the width of the peak representing a convolved density of local phonon modes should increase . in the hot luminescence the intensities of the higher order peaks are of the same order and the width of the lines decrease with increasing order . in addition",
    "a strong emission peak can be observed at the exciton absorption edge .",
    "raman techniques can serve as a direct probe of the orbiton excitation in lamno@xmath0 .",
