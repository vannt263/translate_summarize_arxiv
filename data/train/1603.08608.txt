    ", a clear spin - up feature is seen toward the protostar .",
    "the rotation motion traced by cs abruptly disappears around the radius of 50 au from the protostar , while rotation is still evident to smaller radii in the c@xmath4o emission ( aso et al .",
    "in addition , a counter velocity component caused by the infalling motion is seen in the northeastern part .",
    "although the corresponding counter velocity component in the southwestern part is missing , this may be due to the asymmetrical distribution of the infalling gas around the protostar .",
    "more importantly , the velocity gradient is evident along the outflow direction .",
    "all these characteristic features seen in the cs emission can not be explained by a keplerian disk , but in contrast , strongly suggest an infalling - rotating envelope .",
    "here , we analyzed the pv diagram with a simple ballistic model of an infalling - rotating envelope which is previously applied to l1527 ( sakai et al .",
    "2014a , b ; oya et al . 2015 ) and iras15398 - 3359 ( oya et al .",

    ", the infalling velocity takes its maximum at the centrifugal radius , @xmath35  ( twice the radius of the centrifugal barrier , @xmath36 ) , where the infalling velocity equals to the rotation velocity .",
    "the rotation velocity increases by a factor of 2 from @xmath35  to @xmath36 . toward the protostar position",
    ", only the infalling velocity can be measured , and we find that its maximum velocity at the redshifted side is just a half of the rotation velocity at 50 au ( figure 2a ) .",
    "this means that the gas is certainly infalling beyond @xmath35  at least in the southwestern side .",
    "the radius ( 50 au ) , where the cs emission tracing rotation motion abruptly disappears in the southwestern side , is thus interpreted as the radius of the centrifugal barrier @xmath36  in our model , because of the above factor - of-2 relation .",
    "we performed simulations of molecular emission using the simple ballistic model . in the model , the gas motion is approximated by the particle motion under conservation of kinetic energy and angular momentum . under this assumption , the gas motion depends on the two model parameters , @xmath36  and the total mass of the protostar and the inner disk ( @xmath37 ) ( oya et al .",
    "since our main purpose is to account for the velocity structure , we simply assume an @xmath38 density profile and constant molecular abundances .",
    "the lines are assumed to be optically thin , and no excitation effect is considered for simplicity .",
    "the only difference from the previous models is that we considered an increase in the envelope thickness toward the outside , as shown in a schematic view of figure 1d .",
    "the extension angle of the envelope thickness is assumed to be 30@xmath10 , judging from the k - band ( 1.92 - 2.55 @xmath39 m ) image of this source ( ishii , tamura , and itoh 2004 ) .",
    "we investigated a fairly large space for the three parameters , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and the inclination angle of the envelope .",
    "we assumed an outer radius of the envelope of 350 au , which is the size of the cs emitting region around the protostar ( figure 1b ) .",
    "the model image is convolved by the velocity width of 0.5 km s@xmath21 and the beam size of @xmath24 ( pa=11@xmath10 ) .",
    "although we chose this velocity width by considering the turbulent motion expected in front of the centrifugal barrier , the simulation does not change significantly by use of the 0.2 km s@xmath21 line width .",
    "we found a set of parameters which can reasonably reproduce the observed pv diagrams .",
    "the acceptable range of @xmath36 is from 40 au to 60 au , and that of the mass is from 0.20 @xmath9 to 0.30 @xmath9 .",
    "the inclination angle ( i ) is from 10  to 30 , which is consistent with those reported by harsono et al .",
    "( 2014 ) and aso et al .",
    "( 2015 ) ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively , in our definition ) .",
    "the result of the simulation with the most probable parameters ( @xmath36=50 au , @xmath37=0.25 @xmath9 , and @xmath42=20 ) are shown in figures 2a and 2b .",
    "the model well reproduces the characteristic features of the observed pv diagrams .    on the basis of a change in the power - law index of the rotation curve , harsono et al .",
    "( 2014 ) and aso et al .",
    "( 2015 ) reported the radius of the keplerian disk @xmath43  to be about 100 au , which is larger than @xmath36  derived by our simple model .",
    "since an infalling fluid parcel can not simply cross the disk to reach @xmath36  in hydrodynamics , our ballistic model could be oversimplified .",
    "detailed analysis of more realistic ( and complex ) gas motion in the infalling - rotating envelope and the transition zone to the disk is desirable ( e.g. stahler et al . 1994 ) , but is out of the scope of the present study .",
    "our observation and analysis clearly show , however , an infalling flow down to @xmath350 au .",
    "since it is smaller than @xmath43  reported , it could be an accretion flow from the envelope onto the disk . in the following ,",
    "we still refer to this radius as @xmath36  for simplicity .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the protostellar mass between our model and aso et al .",
    "we derived the protostellar mass to be 0.25 @xmath9 from a simple analysis of an infalling - rotating envelope , while aso et al .",
    "( 2015 ) analyzed the keplerian disk inside the envelope to derive the mass of 0.68 @xmath9 ( inclination corrected ) .",
    "this disagreement is in fact consistent with the findings by aso et al .",
    "( 2015 ) ; in their model using the protostellar mass of 0.68 @xmath9 , the infalling speed of the infalling - rotating envelope is evaluated to be higher than their c@xmath4o ( @xmath5=21 ) observations .",
    "then , they introduce an effective parameter to reduce the infalling speed to explain the kinematics of the infalling - rotating envelope part . hence , structure and physics of the transition zone from the infalling - rotating envelope to the keplerian disk still remain to be explored for thorough understandings of disk formation from the envelope .",

    "2006 ) is @xmath45 @xmath46 , which is similar to that of the cs ( @xmath5=54 ) line .",
    "nevertheless , the distribution is concentrated around the protostar , and is more compact than that of cs .",
    "the so intensity is brighter in the southern part of the integrated intensity map in contrast to the cs case .",
    "figures 2c and 2d show the pv diagrams along the envelope direction and the outflow direction .",
    "along the envelope , the so intensity is brighter in the southeastern part of the pv diagram than in the northeastern part .",
    "since the cs emission is brighter in the northeastern part , the intensity of so seems to be anticorrelated with that of cs . in the southwestern part ,",
    "the so emission is concentrated around the radius of the centrifugal barrier , as in the case of l1527 .",
    "the so molecule would be liberated into the gas phase from ice mantle by a weak accretion shock near the centrifugal barrier .",
    "the actual shock would be occurring in a certain range of the radius in front of the centrifugal barrier , possibly between @xmath36  and @xmath35 .",
    "this situation can be seen in the northeastern side , as described below .",
    "figures 2c and 2d show the model of the infalling - rotating envelope with the same parameters mentioned above .",
    "enhancement of so near the centrifugal barrier can be recognized .    on the other hand , the so distribution",
    "is slightly extended outward of the centrifugal barrier in the northeastern part up to @xmath3100 au . as indicated by the cs distribution ,",
    "the envelope gas distribution is asymmetric around the protostar , and a large amount of the gas is stagnated in front of the centrifugal barrier in the northeastern part . as the result , the accretion shock would occur at a larger radius than the radius of the centrifugal barrier .",
    "hence , the shock would be weakened resulting in a weak so intensity there .",
    "alternatively , a part of so may originate from thermal evaporation by protostellar heating . according to the model by brown and chandler ( 1999 ) , the ` disk '",
    "temperature could be as high as @xmath47 k at 100 au .",
    "this estimate has a large uncertainty , and the actual temperature would be somewhat lower according to the general model for the class i sources ( whitney et al .",
    "nevertheless , an inner part of the envelope might have higher temperature than the evaporation temperature of so ( @xmath360 k ) .",
    "the abundance ratio of so / cs at the centrifugal barrier is derived by using the same non - lte method described in sakai et al .",
    "( 2014b ) . for this purpose ,",
    "we used the intensities integrated from 7.9 to 9.3 km s@xmath21 and from 3.7 to 5.1 km s@xmath21 for the red - shifted and blue - shifted components , because the systemic velocity component would suffer from self - absorption .",
    "the so / cs ratio is evaluated to be 4.6@xmath88.8 and 1.9@xmath83.2 for the red - shifted and blue - shifted components for the h@xmath2 density range from @xmath48 to @xmath49 @xmath46 and the temperature range from 30 to 120 k. the ratio for the red - shifted component is comparable to that found in l1527 ( 4.6@xmath85.9 ) , while that for the blue - shifted component is slightly lower .",
    "the latter result would reflect the weaker accretion shock mentioned above .",
    "apart from the asymmetry of the envelope gas , the physical and chemical situation seen in this source is similar to that observed in l1527 .",
    "namely , cs is mostly distributed outward of the centrifugal barrier , while so is enhanced around and in front of the centrifugal barrier .",
    "we also observed the cch and so@xmath2 lines , whose distributions are similar to that of cs and so , respectively ( sakai et al . in prep . ) .",
    "thus , chemistry highlights the centrifugal barrier .",
    "inward of the centrifugal barrier , these molecules would be depleted onto dust grains in the mid - plane of the disk forming region , although a part of them , particularly those near the surface of the disk , will stay in the gas phase .",
    "we analyzed the kinematic structure of the infalling - rotating envelope traced by the cs line by using the simple ballistic model .",
    "the pv diagrams are effectively explained by the simple model , whose centrifugal barrier is 50 au .",
    "although this source is in the class i stage , the physical and chemical picture is quite similar to that observed in the class 0 source l1527 except for a smaller amount of the infalling gas and its asymmetric distribution .",
    "a drastic chemical change is occurring around the radius of the centrifugal barrier ( 50 au ) .",
    "this means that the envelope materials are significantly processed before being delivered into the disk component .",
    "the present study indicates that the detailed characterization of the envelope is important to study disk formation , and that chemistry is a powerful tool for this purpose .",

    "<S> the velocity structure of the compact component of cs reveals infalling - rotating motion conserving the angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> it is well explained by a ballistic model of an infalling - rotating envelope with the radius of the centrifugal barrier ( a half of the centrifugal radius ) of 50 au , although the distribution of the infalling gas is asymmetric around the protostar . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of so is mostly concentrated around the radius of the centrifugal barrier of the simple model . </S>",
    "<S> thus a drastic change in chemical composition of the gas infalling onto the protostar is found to occur at a 50 au scale probably due to accretion shocks , demonstrating that the infalling material is significantly processed before being delivered into the disk . </S>"
