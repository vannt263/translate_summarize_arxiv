    "<S> experimental and computer - modeling studies of spectral properties of crystalline doped with metal bismuth or bismuth chloride are performed . </S>",
    "<S> broad near - ir luminescence band in the 0.81.2  m range with time dependence described by two exponential components corresponding to the lifetimes of 1.5 and 10.3  s is excited mainly by 0.390.44  m radiation . </S>",
    "<S> computer modeling of probable bi - related centers in lattice is performed . on the basis of experimental and calculation data a conclusion is drawn that the ir luminescence can be caused by @xmath0 ion centers substituted for ag@xmath1 ions .    during the last decade </S>",
    "<S> bismuth - doped bulk glasses and optical fibers are extensively investigated due to their characteristic broadband ir luminescence in the 1.01.7  m range , enabling one to develop optical lasers and amplifiers for fiber - optic communication systems ( e.g. , see review @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> however the origin of bismuth - related ir luminescence centers is not established yet , thus impeding the development of this field . recently ( see , for example , discussion in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) an opinion is strengthened that the ir luminescence is caused by bismuth in subvalent states , and first of all in monovalent state ( @xmath0 ) . to study the optical characteristics of bismuth - related centers of such a nature </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to use crystalline halides of monovalent elements as a modeling host with a simple structure ( primitive , , or face - centered , , cubic lattices ) , in which the impurity bismuth should form substitutional centers just in monovalent state .    </S>",
    "<S> the ir luminescence in bismuth - doped crystalline halides of monovalent metals was found and investigated for the first time in ( primitive lattice ) , and possible structure of the centers responsible for the luminescence were suggested @xcite . later the ir luminescence was observed in crystals ( lattice ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> probable ir luminescence centers in and were studied then by computer simulation technique @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the present paper is devoted to the study of ir luminescence in crystals with face - centered lattice .    </S>",
    "<S> the crystal was grown from silver chloride salts deposited from aqueous agno@xmath2 solution after drying and purification by the method of directional ( oriented ) melt crystallization . before growth 30  g of ligature with metal bismuth ( bi ) or bismuth chloride ( bicl@xmath2 ) dopant ( 0.076  mass.% of bi ) were prepared . </S>",
    "<S> ligature was sealed in vacuum inside 16  mm - diameter ampule and melted at 400450  @xmath3c . </S>",
    "<S> the melt was mixed no less than 56 times by the method of ampule reverse ( flip - chip ) and cured for 3 days . after cooling to room temperature </S>",
    "<S> the ligature was overloaded into the growth ampule 18  mm in diameter , supplied with pure silver chloride to total 100  g , melted in vacuum , mixed 35 times again and grown up by bridgman - stockbarger method at a rate of 1  mm / h . </S>",
    "<S> growth was proceeded for about 7 days . </S>",
    "<S> after growth the crystal was quenched to room temperature at a rate of 5060  @xmath3c / h . </S>",
    "<S> bicl@xmath2-doped samples have appeared to be dim or opaque . in samples doped with metal bismuth the inclusions in the form of metal flakes ( presumably silver ) were observed . for spectroscopic measurements two samples of 18  mm diameter and 5  mm thickness were cut from the grown crystals , one from initial part of the crystal ( where crystallization starts during crystal growth ) , and the other from the final one ( where crystallization ends ) . </S>",
    "<S> x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) analysis of powders of all the samples was performed on dron  3 m diffractometer using filtered cu @xmath4 radiation . </S>",
    "<S> jcpds database was used to identify crystalline phases . </S>",
    "<S> the xrd measurements revealed diffraction patterns typical for rock - salt - type crystal ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : xrd ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> lattice constant was found to be @xmath5  nm in metal - doped and @xmath6  nm in bicl@xmath2-doped ( to be compared with @xmath7  nm in reference non - doped crystal ) .        </S>",
    "<S> the transmission spectra were measured on perkin - elmer lambda  900 spectrometer , and the luminescence spectra on edinburgh instruments flsp920 spectrometer . </S>",
    "<S> the transmission spectra of two samples are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : transmission ] . </S>",
    "<S> the short - wave transmission edge of sample doped with metal bismuth is near 0.41  m that fits well with the known experimental data for pure ( transmission edge is near 0.42  m @xcite , indirect energy gap is about 3.2  ev @xcite ) . in samples doped with bismuth chloride a considerable decrease in transmission </S>",
    "<S> is observed in the near ir range . in the spectra of both samples </S>",
    "<S> there are no distinctly expressed absorption bands .    in the luminescence </S>",
    "<S> spectra a wide ir luminescence band is discovered with a maximum near 0.90  m and width about 0.30  m ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : luminescence ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the luminescence in this band is excited mainly in the absorption band with a maximum near 0.42  m ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : excitation ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the efficiency of luminescence excitation at other wavelengths is much lower . </S>",
    "<S> no luminescence is found in agcl samples containing no bismuth .    </S>",
    "<S> the intensity of ir luminescence in samples doped with metal bismuth is considerably ( about two times ) higher in comparison with the samples doped with bismuth chloride . on the other hand , in metal - doped samples the luminescence intensity noticeably changes along the grown crystal length : the sample cut from the final part exhibits much more intensive luminescence . </S>",
    "<S> this fact could be explained by bismuth displacement together with the moving crystallization zone resulting in the content of active bismuth centers increasing from initial part to the final part of the produced crystal .    </S>",
    "<S> the suppression of ir luminescence from measurement to measurement is found out : with each new irradiation of the sample near the main excitation band , i.e. within 0.390.44  m range , the luminescence intensity decreases . at the same time , </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the luminescence spectrum actually does not change . at excitation in a longer - wave range , e.g. near 0.53  m ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : excitation ] ) , the effect of degradation is practically absent ; however the efficiency of luminescence excitation is extremely low .        </S>",
    "<S> time dependence of ir luminescence is described by two exponential components @xmath8 , where @xmath9 ( in arbitrary units ) , @xmath10  s , @xmath11  s. within the fitting accuracy ( about 10% ) these parameters do not differ in metal - doped and chloride - doped samples . </S>",
    "<S> the luminescence lifetimes are considerably shorter than those in ( 130 and 210  s @xcite ) and in ( 200350  s @xcite ) crystals , presumably due to high degree of disorder typical for cation sublattice in crystals .    </S>",
    "<S> transmission decrease in the near ir range in bicl@xmath2-doped samples can be explained by the fact that for such a doping technique bismuth is incorporated in the crystal lattice mainly in trivalent state ( @xmath12 ) , substituting for silver ion . </S>",
    "<S> this substitution should be accompanied by a formation of two cation vacancies compensating an excess charge of substitutional center . </S>",
    "<S> thus , instead of three sites with monovalent cations there are : a site with trivalent cation , two cation vacancies and two monovalent interstitial ag@xmath1 ions ( in other words , two frenkel pairs ) . </S>",
    "<S> similar lattice disordering can be followed by an increase both in scattering and absorption near the short - wave edge as a result of occurrence of localized states in the forbidden zone . in the case of metal doping , </S>",
    "<S> bismuth is most likely introduced in the crystal lattice mainly as monovalent substitutional impurity ( @xmath0 ) , without causing an appreciable lattice disordering , and accordingly , a significant absorption or scattering . rather low intensity of ir luminescence of bicl@xmath2-doped samples in comparison with metal - doped samples can be presumably explained just by considerable optical losses in the first - type samples .        to understand the origin of bismuth - related centers responsible for the revealed ir luminescence , we performed computer simulation of the structure and absorption spectra of several most probable centers which could be formed by impurity bismuth atoms in crystal lattice , namely : monovalent substitutional @xmath0 centers , complexes formed by substitutional bismuth center in cation site and silver or chlorine vacancy in the nearest cation or anion lattice site , and interstitial @xmath0 ions . </S>",
    "<S> for the modeling we used @xmath13 or @xmath14 supercells containing 64 or 96 atoms , accordingly . </S>",
    "<S> in the central part of supercell silver atom was substituted by bismuth atom , an interstitial bismuth atom was introduced , and also vacancies were formed by a removal of one of silver or chlorine atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the charge state of the center was given by a total supercell charge . </S>",
    "<S> equilibrium configurations of bismuth - related centers were found by a complete optimization of geometry with the gradient method in the plane wave basis within the generalized gradient approximation of density functional theory using pseudopotentials . </S>",
    "<S> such calculations were carried out by means of software package @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus obtained configurations of bismuth - related centers were used further to calculate the absorption spectra of the centers by bethe - salpeter equation method based on all - electron full - potential linearized augmented plane wave approach taking into account spin - orbit interaction essential for bismuth - containing systems . for calculations </S>",
    "<S> the code @xcite was used . to estimate the stokes luminescence shift , the configurational </S>",
    "<S> coordinate diagrams of bismuth - related centers in the frame of a simple model were calculated as well . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained results show that for all bismuth - related centers studied there are bases to consider the stokes shift small and to estimate the luminescence wavelength without taking the shift into account . </S>",
    "<S> detailed description of the calculation technique is given in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> calculation results on bismuth - related centers are convenient for interpreting within the limits of the models used earlier for bismuth - related centers in , , @xcite , , and @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as is known , the ground and the first two excited states of @xmath0 ion arise from triplet ( an electronic configuration 6s@xmath15p@xmath15 ) split by strong spin - orbit interaction into components : ( ground state ) , and ( excited states with the energies for a free ion near 13300 and 17000  @xmath16 , accordingly ) . </S>",
    "<S> these states can be split and mixed under the influence of the environment of the @xmath0 ion in the crystal lattice .        in the case of monovalent </S>",
    "<S> substitutional @xmath0 center such a transformation of states is due to a redistribution of electronic density between the bismuth ion and the neighboring chlorine ions , but is not due to the crystal field ( owing to a cubic symmetry of the substitutional center ) . according to the calculations , in such a redistribution appears to be rather weak . </S>",
    "<S> energy levels and transitions between them calculated for monovalent substitutional bismuth center @xmath0 are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : levels ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noticing that splitting the first excited state is insignificant . considering in accordance with the above - </S>",
    "<S> said the stokes shift to be small , one could expect for monovalent substitutional bismuth center , @xmath0 , the occurrence of ir luminescence in the 0.91.0  </S>",
    "<S> m region excited in two absorption bands near 0.4 and 0.5  m.    calculation results have shown that the influence of lattice on other bismuth - related centers under study is substantially reduced to the crystal field effect and in a qualitative sense is described by the model similar to that suggested in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and used in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , we should emphasize that although this model allows visual interpreting of the origin of states in bismuth - related centers , it describes the occurring electronic structure only in the rough . </S>",
    "<S> the quantitative conclusions are based on the performed calculation results .     </S>",
    "<S> center ( energy levels in @xmath17  @xmath16 , transition wavelengths in m ) . </S>",
    "<S> , height=519 ]    in the case of interstitial @xmath0 ion the crystal field appears to be too weak and causes only insignificant splitting and shift of ion states . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the interstitial @xmath0 ion in , like @xmath0 ions in chloride solutions @xcite , can cause a weak absorption in the bands near 0.7 , 0.6 and 0.5  m , accompanied by a luminescence near 0.7  m. the experimental data available do not allow to make certain conclusions about the presence or absence of interstitial @xmath0 ions in .    on the contrary , in the complex formed by substitutional bismuth center and chlorine vacancy in the nearest lattice site </S>",
    "<S> , the crystal field appears to be strong . </S>",
    "<S> thus there is a redistribution of electronic density between bismuth atom and chlorine vacancy , so that in rough approximation such a complex represents a pair of charged centers : @xmath0 ion in cation site and negatively charged chlorine vacancy . in axial crystal field influenced by the vacancy , the ground state of bi+ ion ( ) </S>",
    "<S> is not split at all , the excited state is split into two levels with the energies about 4400 and 10500  @xmath16 , and the excited state is split into three levels with the energies about 12000 , 17000 and 22000  @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> considering the stokes shift to be small , it is possible to expect for the complex `` substitutional bismuth center  chlorine vacancy '' the ir luminescence in the @xmath18  m region , and probably in the 1  m region , excited in absorption bands near 0.8 , 0.6 and 0.4  m. as follows from a comparison of these results with the experimental data , similar complexes can make only an insignificant contribution to the ir luminescence observed in .    as to the complex `` substitutional bismuth center  </S>",
    "<S> silver vacancy '' , it was found to be highly unstable in our calculations : owing to lattice transformation in the vicinity of the complex , silver ion from the next coordination shell fills the vacancy and so the complex actually disappears .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , the performed modeling gives the grounds to believe that the main contribution to the ir luminescence in is made by monovalent substitutional bismuth centers , @xmath0 . in this case an observable decrease in intensity of the luminescence excited in absorption band near 0.42  m can be explained . </S>",
    "<S> radiation with wavelength close to the edge of interband absorption of excites the electron - hole pairs . </S>",
    "<S> capturing electrons from the conductivity band , monovalent substitutional bismuth centers @xmath0 are restored to neutral @xmath19 centers , making no contribution to the ir luminescence . </S>"
