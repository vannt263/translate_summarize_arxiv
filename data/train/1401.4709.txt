    "due to the benefits of cooperative multiple - input and multiple - output ( mimo ) systems @xcite , extensive studies of cooperative mimo networks have been undertaken @xcite-@xcite . in @xcite ,",

    "a transmit diversity selection matrix is introduced at each relay node in order to achieve a better mse performance by deactivating some relay nodes . a central node which controls the transmission power for each link",

    "although the centralized power allocation can improve the performance significantly , the complexity of the calculation increases with the size of the system .",
    "the works on the power allocation problem for the df strategy measuring the outage probability in each relay node with a single antenna and determining the power for each link between the relay nodes and the destination node , have been reported in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the diversity gain can be improved by using relay nodes with multiple antennas . when the number of relay nodes is the same , the cooperative gain can be improved by using the df strategy compared with a system employing the af strategy .",
    "however , the interference at the destination will be increased if the relay nodes forward the incorrectly detected symbols in the df strategy . the power allocation optimization algorithms in @xcite and @xcite",
    "provide improved ber performance at the cost of requiring an eigenvalue decomposition to obtain the key parameters .    in this paper",

    "three optimization criteria , namely , mmse , minimum bit error rate ( mber ) and maximum sum rate ( msr ) , are employed in the proposed japa optimization algorithms in this paper .",
    "we firstly develop joint optimization algorithms of the power allocation matrices and the linear receive filter according to these three criteria , respectively , which require matrix inversions and bring a high computational burden to the receiver . in the proposed japa algorithms with the mmse , mber , and msr criteria , an sg method @xcite",
    "is employed in order to reduce the computational complexity of the proposed algorithms .",
    "a comparison of the computational complexity of the algorithms is considered in this paper .",
