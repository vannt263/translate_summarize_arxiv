    "there are two scenarios exist in literature , namely , inflation and bouncing model which address the shortcomings of the standard model of cosmology .",
    "though inflation solves most of the problems ( horizon , flatness and entropy ) of the standard model of cosmology , the issue with the initial singularity is not resolved under its domain .",
    "it is the alternate scenario , nonsingular bouncing model , that eradicates the singularity by constructing a universe which begins with a contracting phase and then bounces back to an expanding phase through a non zero minimum in the scale factor .",
    "nonsingular bouncing models can be categorised into two types , matter bounce model@xcite and and ekpyrotik models@xcite . for a review on these scenarios",
    "refer to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a severe problem with bouncing cosmologies is that of instability which develops due to the growth of anisotropic stress during contracting phase , as it grows as sixth inverse power of scale factor .",
    "this problem is known as bkl instability@xcite .",
    "originally ekpyrotic bouncing models were developed to cure this instability@xcite .",
    "this requires a matter field with equation of state parameter @xmath0 greater than 1 . in this case energy density of the matter field dominates over anisotropic stress so that this instability is eliminated .",
    "it may be impossible to build a consistent ekpyrotic bouncing model with one canonical scalar field which is free from bkl instability@xcite .",
    "the ekpyrotic scenario given in @xcite is not able to produce scale invariant power spectrum with one scalar field .",
    "however , the scale invariant spectrum can be achieved by non trivial matching of curvature perturbation across the bounce in an ekpyrotic scenario@xcite .",
    "later , a new ekpyrotic scenario has been developed , wherein a second scalar field is added which is an isocurvature mode to start with and becomes an adiabatic one during the evolution @xcite .",
    "this new ekpyrotic model produces a scale invariant power spectrum .",
    "bkl instability develops also in new ekpyrotic models @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the `` new ekpyrotic '' scenario can produce nonsingular bounce if the second scalar field is a ghost condensate @xcite .",
    "unstable growth of curvature perturbation and anisotropy is still a matter of concern for new ekpyrotic models @xcite .",
    "whereas matter bounce models can be free from these instabilities as shown in ref .",
