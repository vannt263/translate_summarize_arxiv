    "clusters of galaxies are important probes of the distribution of both matter and light on intermediate scales ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "they are also interesting laboratories for studying the effects of local environment on cluster galaxies .",
    "most studies of clusters concentrate on the central regions where the cluster is probably in equilibrium .",
    "studies of the galaxy distribution on larger scales tend to focus either on general properties of large - scale structure ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) or on individual superclusters ( e.g. , giovanelli & haynes 1985 ) .",
    "there are relatively few examinations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) of the infall regions of clusters . in these regions ,",
    "the galaxies are falling into the gravitational potential well of the cluster , but they have not yet reached equilibrium .",
    "many , perhaps most , of the galaxies in this region are on their first orbit of the cluster .",
    "they populate a regime between that of relaxed cluster cores and the surrounding large - scale structure where the transition from linear to non - linear clustering occurs .    here",
    "we use 1057 redshifts and photometry of 2118 galaxies in the infall region of abell 576 ( @xmath0 ) to address an unresolved problem in astrophysics : the relative distribution of mass and light on large scales .",
    "zwicky ( 1933 ; 1937 ) originally found that the mass of the coma cluster greatly exceeds the sum of the masses of the stars .",
    "more recently , calculations of mass - to - light ratios for galaxy clusters yield values of several hundred in solar units ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "girardi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) calculated mass - to - light ratios for a large sample of nearby clusters within the virial radius and obtained typical values of @xmath11 ( all @xmath12 values are in solar units , i.e. , @xmath13 ) .",
    "david , jones , & forman ( 1995 ) find @xmath14 for seven groups and clusters using masses calculated from the observed x - ray emission , and the cnoc survey finds @xmath15 for a sample of distant clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "the mass density parameter @xmath16 of the universe can be estimated by assuming that the universal mass - to - light ratio is equal to the ratio in rich clusters of galaxies ( e.g. , carlberg et al .",
    "there have been few attempts to determine mass - to - light ratios directly at larger radii ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , where clusters are in neither hydrostatic nor virial equilibrium . neither x - ray observations nor virial analysis provide accurate mass determinations at these large radii . two methods with particular promise",
    "are weak gravitational lensing ( @xcite ) and kinematics of the infall region ( diaferio & geller 1997 , hereafter dg ; diaferio 1999 , hereafter d99 ) .",
    "kaiser et al .  analyzed the weak lensing signal from a supercluster at @xmath17 and found no significant evidence for variations in mass - to - light ratios on scales less than @xmath18 .",
    "metzler et al .  ( 1999 ) , however , show that lensing by intervening filamentary structures probably associated with clusters can result in significant overestimates of cluster masses .",
    "geller , diaferio , & kurtz ( 1999 , hereafter gdk ) applied the kinematic method of dg to the infall region of the coma cluster .",
    "they successfully reproduced the x - ray derived mass profile and extended direct determinations of the mass profile to @xmath19 .",
    "adequate photometric data necessary to compute the mass - to - light profile for this large region around coma are not yet available .    here",
    "we apply the method of dg to a576 . in redshift space ,",
    "the infall regions of clusters form a characteristic trumpet - shaped pattern .",
    "these caustics arise because galaxies fall into the cluster as the cluster potential overwhelms the hubble flow ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . under simple spherical infall",
    ", the galaxy phase space density becomes infinite at the caustics .",
    "dg analyzed the dynamics of infall regions with numerical simulations and found that in the outskirts of clusters , random motions due to substructure and non - radial motions make a substantial contribution to the amplitude of the caustics which delineate the infall regions .",
    "dg showed that the amplitude of the caustics is a measure of the escape velocity from the cluster ; identification of the caustics therefore allows a determination of the mass profile of the cluster on scales @xmath20 .",
    "dg show that nonparametric measurements of caustics would yield cluster mass profiles accurate to @xmath2130% on scales @xmath22 , if ( 1 ) the redshift space coordinates of the dark matter particles were measurable , and ( 2 ) the cluster mass within the virial radius were known exactly .",
    "more realistically , by using simulated catalogs of galaxies formed and evolved using semi - analytic procedures within the dark matter halos of dissipationless n - body simulations ( @xcite ) , d99 shows that the identification of caustics in the realistic redshift diagrams of clusters recovers their mass profiles within a factor of 2 to several megaparsecs from the cluster center without a separate determination of the central mass .",
    "when combined with wide - field photometry , this approach allows a determination of the mass - to - light ratio on large scales which is independent of the assumption that light traces mass .",
    "this method assumes only that galaxies trace the velocity field .",
    "indeed , simulations suggest that velocity bias , if any , is very weak on both linear and non - linear scales ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "vedel & hartwick ( 1998 ) used simulations to explore an alternative parametric maximum likelihood analysis of the infall region .",
    "their technique requires assumptions about the functional forms of the density profile and the velocity dispersion profile .    here",
    ", we analyze the caustics within a @xmath1 radius to determine the mass profile of abell 576 , an abell richness class 1 cluster ( @xcite ) at a redshift of @xmath23 .",
    "mohr et al .",
    "( 1996 , hereafter m96 ) extensively studied the inner square degree of this cluster . using photometric observations of a @xmath5 region centered on the cluster , we determine the mass - to - light profile within this range .",
    "the integrated mass - to - light ratio smoothly decreases with radius out to @xmath1 .",
    "remarkably , the differential mass - to - light ratio decreases steeply to values typical of individual galaxy halos .",
    "we describe the photometric and spectroscopic observations in @xmath24 2 . in @xmath24 3 , we determine the amplitude of the caustics and calculate the mass profile .",
    "we analyze the x - ray observations in @xmath24 4 and compare the x - ray mass profile to the infall mass profile .",
    "we discuss the contribution of background galaxies in @xmath24 5 .",
    "we determine the surface number density profile in @xmath24 6 and compare it to the mass distribution .",
    "we test for luminosity segregation in @xmath24 7 and calculate the light profile in @xmath24 8 .",

    "we obtained ten 200-second r - band images of a576 with the mosaic camera on the 0.9-m telescope at kitt peak on 1999 february 13 - 14 ; both nights were photometric .",
    "the mosaic camera consists of 8 ccd chips , each with a field of view of 15@xmath28 .",
    "our mosaic thus covers approximately a @xmath5 region centered on a576 .",
    "adjacent images overlap by 1@xmath290 .",
    "we imaged the central square degree on both nights ; the 14 february image is offset 1@xmath290 n and 1@xmath290 e from the 13 february image .",
    "we reduced the images using standard iraf procedures in the _ mscred _ package .",
    "we use sextractor ( @xcite ) to locate sources in the images and calculate magnitudes .",
    "sextractor divides the image into segments and assigns pixels to individual objects to deal with crowded images .",
    "analysis of simulated ccd images show that sextractor accurately recovers total magnitudes of faint galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "we use the mag_best magnitudes , which are equivalent to mag_auto , an aperture magnitude , unless an object has one or more close neighbors likely to contaminate the flux by more than 10% , in which case mag_best = mag_isoc , an isophotal magnitude with a correction based on a gaussian light profile .",
    "we classify all objects with class_star@xmath30  0.6 as galaxy candidates ; we then visually inspect these to eliminate binary stars and artifacts .",
    "we calibrate the photometry with observations of m67 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and landolt ( 1992 ) fields .",
    "we obtain the color correction term from the data set for the entire observing run and the extinction coefficient from fits to data on all chips for each night . to allow for possible chip - to - chip sensitivity variations , we calculate the zero point separately for each chip ( @xcite ) .",
    "we use the iraf package _ apphot _ to test the accuracy of the sextractor magnitudes . using curves of growth on the images of a few dozen galaxies covering the range of magnitudes @xmath31 to @xmath32 = 18",
    ", we estimate their total magnitudes within large apertures ( 50 - 150@xmath33 ) .",
    "we find excellent agreement ( @xmath34 mag ) between the iraf total aperture magnitudes and the sextractor mag_best magnitudes .",
    "we restrict our analyses to objects with mag_best@xmath3018.0 , approximately the limit of the classification .",
    "we use the offset images of the central region to estimate the consistency of our magnitudes ; the distribution of @xmath35 ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the magnitudes calculated from the first and second night respectively ) for galaxies with @xmath3818.0 is well represented by a gaussian with a zero point difference of -0.002  mag and @xmath39 mag .",
    "the scatter in the magnitude determination increases significantly with apparent magnitude ( figure [ figcompmagn1n2 ] ) .",
    "we thus estimate that our magnitudes are internally consistent to about 0.06 mag ( @xmath40 ) . in table 1",
    ", we list the r band magnitudes and their uncertainties ( quadrature sums of the internal sextractor errors and the 0.06 mag scatter from galaxies with multiple observations ) for galaxies with redshifts from flwo ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "we also include estimates of galactic extinction in the r band ( @xmath42 ) based on the dust maps of schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) .",
    "mohr et al .  ( 2000 ) will list redshifts collected by jjm and gw .",
    "magnitudes for these galaxies as well as those without redshifts are available upon request from the authors . in the entire survey region ,",
    "we identify 825 and 2118 galaxies with @xmath3817.0 and @xmath3818.0 respectively .",
    "we compare our photometry with that of m96 .",
    "figure [ figcompmagm96]a shows the difference in magnitude between the two studies as a function of our magnitudes .",
    "the comparison suggests that our magnitudes are systematically brighter by @xmath43 mag .",
    "further analysis , however , shows that the differences between our magnitudes and m96 can be attributed to differences in the reduction packages ( sextractor versus focas ) .",
    "for example , focas uses a global estimate of background counts while sextractor uses a local estimate .",
    "a complete comparison of the differences between these packages is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "a reanalysis of the m96 data using sextractor produces excellent agreement ( figure [ figcompmagm96]b ) between the two independent photometric data sets ( @xcite ) .",
    "out of 823 galaxies with redshifts selected without reference to these images ( @xmath41 ) , sextractor misses 28 .",
    "visual inspection reveals that 17 of these galaxies are in the halos of bright stars ; the rest lie in chip gaps .",
    "for the 17 galaxies in stellar halos , we perform photometry with _",
    "apphot_. unfortunately , three of these galaxies are located within @xmath44 of the x - ray center of the cluster ( a saturated star is @xmath45 from the x - ray center ) , which increases the uncertainty of the central light .",
    "we make no correction for the regions of sky covered by saturated stars ; this approach may lead to a slight underestimate in the light profile .",
    "we used the fast spectrograph ( @xcite ) on the 1.5-m tillinghast telescope of the fred lawrence whipple observatory ( flwo ) to obtain 529 spectra of galaxies within @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) of the center of a576 .",
    "fast is a long - slit spectrograph with a ccd detector .",
    "integration times were typically 4 - 20 minutes , with spectral resolution of 6 - 8  .",
    "we analyzed the spectra at the telescope data center at the smithsonian astrophysical observatory using the _ xcsao _ and _ emsao _ tasks , which are standard cross - correlation fitting routines ( @xcite ) available in the iraf package _ r2rvsao_. in this technique , template galaxy spectra are cross - correlated with the observed log - wavelength binned spectra to determine the redshift which provides the best fit for a particular template .",
    "cross - correlation fits with r values of @xmath48 are acceptable ; most spectra have larger r values ( the goodness of fit increases with r value ) .",
    "we observed infall galaxy candidates in two campaigns ; these occurred before and after obtaining the mosaic images described above . to select candidates for the first campaign ( 1999 january - february )",
    ", we obtained galaxy positions from digital scans of the poss i plates , using a method developed by daniel koranyi ( 1999 ) to discriminate between stars and galaxies .",
    "we extracted sources from the plate scans with sextractor .",
    "we included all objects with staricity parameter @xmath300.6 and iso7-to - iso2 isophotal ratio greater than 0.25 .",
    "comparison with visual inspection suggests that @xmath49 of galaxies are misclassified as stars using this criterion .",
    "we visually inspected the remaining objects to eliminate stars from the sample . for galaxies with @xmath50 , we measured redshifts in magnitude order . because the magnitude order was taken from the plate scans , this ordering is not strictly accurate , and we could not obtain redshifts for some low surface brightness galaxies . out of 300 candidates , this campaign yielded 293 redshifts ( 11 candidates were stars , plate flaws , or unobservable ; 4 galaxies were serendipitously observed ) .    in the second campaign ( 1999 october-2000 february ) , we selected candidates from the mosaic images . prior to the second campaign ,",
    "our redshift sample was @xmath51 complete for @xmath52 .",
    "in the second campaign , we observed 236 galaxies in magnitude order as determined from the mosaic images .",
    "we list the redshifts and @xmath32 magnitudes of the galaxies from both campaigns in table 1 .",
    "table 2 lists the positions and redshifts of galaxies outside the mosaic images .",
    "two of us ( jjm and gw ) obtained 528 redshifts of galaxies in the central @xmath53 of this region for a separate jeans analysis of the central region of a576 ( @xcite ) .",
    "281 of these redshifts are from m96 ; the remainder will be published in mohr et al .",
    "these redshifts were measured at the decaspec ( @xcite ) at the 2.4-m mdm telescope on kitt peak and hydra , the multifiber spectrograph on the wiyn telescope on kitt peak .",
    "figure [ figfracobserved ] shows the fraction of galaxies with redshifts as a function of r - band magnitude .",
    "we divide the sample into the region mostly covered by jjm and gw ( projected radius @xmath54 ) and the region mostly covered by this study ( @xmath55 ) . within the @xmath56 region covered by our images ,",
    "the total sample of 817 galaxies is 100% ( 99.7% ) complete to a limiting magnitude of @xmath57 ; the latter is the completeness limit for the photometric region .",
    "we briefly review the method dg and d99 develop to estimate the mass profile of a galaxy cluster by identifying its caustics in redshift space .",
    "the method assumes that clusters form through hierarchical clustering and requires only galaxy redshifts and positions on the sky .",
    "the amplitude @xmath58 of the caustics is half of the distance between the upper and lower caustics in redshift space . assuming spherical symmetry , @xmath58 is related to the cluster gravitational potential @xmath59 by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the velocity anisotropy parameter .",
    "dg show that the mass of a spherical shell of radii [ @xmath62 within the infall region is given by the integral of the square of the amplitude @xmath58 @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a filling factor with a numerical value estimated from simulations .",
    "variations in @xmath65 lead to some systematic uncertainty in the derived mass profile .",
    "our mass profile extends to @xmath66 ( the average density within @xmath67 is @xmath68 times the critical density , @xmath69 ) ; within this radius , @xmath65 varies by @xmath70 in simulations ( see d99 for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "operationally , we identify the caustics as curves which delineate a significant drop in the phase space density of galaxies in the projected radius - redshift diagram .",
    "galaxies outside the caustics are also outside the turnaround radius . for a spherically symmetric system , taking an azimuthal average amplifies the signal of the caustics in redshift space and smooths over small - scale substructures .",
    "d99 described this method in detail and showed that , when applied to simulated clusters with galaxies modelled with semi - analytic techniques , it recovers the actual mass profiles within a factor of 2 to 5 - 10@xmath71 from the cluster center .",
    "d99 describes some potential systematic effects including projection effects and variation in the galaxy orbit distribution @xmath72 .",
    "simulations are necessary to estimate the uncertainties due to projection effects and deviations from spherical symmetry . in the simulations of d99 ,",
    "the degree of definition of the caustics depends on the underlying cosmology ; in simulations , caustics are better defined in a low - density universe than a closed , matter - dominated universe ( d99 ) .",
    "surprisingly , the caustics of coma , a576 , and several other clusters ( @xcite ) are generally better defined than those of the simulated clusters .",
    "thus , the uncertainties estimated from these simulations might be overestimates .",
    "we apply the technique of d99 to our a576 survey to determine the spatial and velocity center of the region as well as the location of the caustics . in this technique , we determine the center of the system from a hierarchical cluster analysis .",
    "the center thus derived , @xmath73 7:21:31.96 , @xmath74 + 55:45:20.6 ( j2000 ) , @xmath0 , lies 50@xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) from the x - ray center ( m96 , from _",
    "ipc data ; see also @xmath24 4 for _ asca _ data ) .",
    "our measurement of the central velocity of the infall region agrees well with previous estimates ( struble & rood 1991 , m96 ) .",
    "figure [ figcaustics ] shows the projected radius from the cluster center versus redshift for galaxies within @xmath77 of the cluster center .",
    "this range of redshifts includes all galaxies which may be members of the infall region .",
    "solid lines indicate the caustics determined using the method of d99 based on a multidimensional adaptive kernel method ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this technique has been applied to numerical simulations ( d99 ) as well as to the coma cluster ( gdk ) . as discussed in d99 , it is necessary to rescale @xmath78 and @xmath79 , the velocity and radial smoothing lengths so that spherical smoothing windows can be used . with an appropriate choice of this scaling relation @xmath80 ,",
    "the location of the caustics should be insensitive to small changes in @xmath81 . in our case",
    ", @xmath82 satisfies this criterion .",
    "following d99 , we define the caustic amplitude @xmath58 as the minimum of the upper and lower amplitude estimates .",
    "this prescription is identical to averaging the two estimates for an isolated , spherically symmetric system ; taking the minimum reduces the sensitivity to massive substructure and contamination .",
    "we note that in a576 , the location of the caustics is sensitive to substructure at @xmath83 .",
    "the caustic amplitude decreases sharply to @xmath84 somewhere in this region , though the radius of the decrease is sensitive to the smoothing parameter @xmath81 .",
    "figure [ figcausticsq ] shows the caustics determined by setting @xmath85 , 25 , and 50 .",
    "small values of @xmath86 seem to oversmooth the caustics and the sharp decrease occurs at @xmath87 , whereas the sharp decrease occurs at @xmath88 for larger values of @xmath89 .",
    "the amplitude of the caustics is stable both at radii smaller than @xmath88 and at radii larger than @xmath87 .",
    "d99 gives the prescription for estimating the uncertainties in the caustic amplitude ; this prescription reflects the scatter due to projection effects in the simulations .",
    "we show these @xmath90 uncertainties in figure [ figcaustics ] .",
    "we define membership of the infall region from the caustics ; hereafter , galaxies outside these caustics are interlopers . of the 497 galaxies within @xmath91 of the velocity center of a576 , 368 are within the infall region .",
    "figure [ figskyplotz ] shows the distribution of these galaxies on the sky . there is a noticeable deficit of infalling galaxies nw of the cluster center .",
    "we compare our results to navarro , frenk , & white ( 1997 , hereafter @xcite ) , hernquist ( 1990 ) , and singular isothermal sphere mass profiles .",
    "the hernquist profile is an analytic form proposed as a model of elliptical galaxies and bulges ( hernquist 1990 ) .",
    "the `` universal density profile '' of nfw accurately models the mass profiles of dark matter halos in a variety of cosmological simulations ( @xcite ) .",
    "other simulations suggest that the nfw profile may not be accurate at small radii ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but these differences are unimportant on the scales we probe here .",
    "these mass profiles are : m_nfw(r ) = c_nfw a [ ( ) - ] , m_hern(r ) = c_hern , m_iso(r ) = c_iso r respectively , where @xmath92 is the characteristic radius and @xmath93 is a normalization factor .",
    "these forms of the mass profiles minimize the correlation between the parameters .",
    "for the hernquist profile , the mass @xmath94 within @xmath92 is @xmath95 , and the total mass of the system is @xmath96 . from equation [ mprofeqn ] , a singular isothermal sphere mass profile produces caustics with constant amplitudes .",
    "however , figure [ figcaustics ] shows that the amplitude of the caustics decreases with radius .",
    "we fit these models to the observed mass profile by minimizing @xmath97 ; table [ mprof ] lists the results",
    ". the measures of the cumulative mass profiles are not independent ; thus , the values of @xmath98 are indicative and are only meaningful when compared with each other .",
    "the best - fit parameters are insensitive to the inclusion or exclusion of the three data points where the caustics are unstable ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "figure [ figcmassprof ] shows the three profiles which best fit the infall mass profile and figure [ figrho ] shows the mass density profile .",
    "the latter display has the benefit that the data points are largely indepedendent of one another .",
    "the density of the cluster varies by five orders of magnitude across our sample ; the overall agreement between these profiles and the data is remarkable .",
    "the isothermal sphere profile is strongly excluded .",
    "the hernquist profile yields a better @xmath97 than the nfw profile , but both are acceptable .",
    "this conclusion agrees with gdk , who found that the mass profile of coma is much better described by an nfw profile than an isothermal sphere .    from the infall mass profile",
    ", we can derive the values of overdensity radii @xmath67 directly .",
    "the mass @xmath100 contained within the overdensity radius @xmath67 exceeds the critical density by a factor of @xmath68 .",
    "two of the most commonly used radii are @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the values of these radii are usually determined indirectly .",
    "for instance , carlberg et al .",
    "( 1997 , hereafter cye ) define @xmath101 using the velocity dispersion @xmath103 of a cluster .",
    "evrard , metzler , & navarro ( 1996 ) use simulations to calibrate a correlation between @xmath102 and the emission - weighted x - ray temperature @xmath104 .",
    "we estimate @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "a576 has an emission - weighted temperature of @xmath107 kev ( see @xmath108 ) , which yields an estimate of @xmath109 using the evrard et al .",
    "estimator , in agreement with our result .",
    "many recent papers analyze the velocity dispersion profiles of clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; m96 ) . when combined with the galaxy number density profile in the jeans equation",
    ", the velocity dispersion profile can provide an estimate of the mass profile ; mohr et al .",
    "( 2000 ) will perform this analysis for a576 .",
    "figure [ figvdp ] shows the velocity dispersion profile of a576 where we compute the dispersions in bins of 25 galaxies .",
    "we also display the cumulative projected velocity dispersion profile @xmath110 ( calculated from all galaxies inside @xmath111 ) .",
    "the profile is centrally peaked and would probably be classified as peaked by den hartog & katgert ( 1996 ) .",
    "several authors ( @xcite ; cye ) suggest that the velocity dispersion of a cluster is best estimated by the asymptotic value of the cumulative projected velocity dispersion .",
    "for a576 , @xmath110 decreases monotonically with radius for @xmath112 , suggesting that an asymptotic value of @xmath110 may not exist . at the largest radius we study , @xmath113 .",
    "this velocity dispersion is significantly smaller than @xmath114 ( m96 ) or @xmath115 ( girardi et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the cye estimate of @xmath101 is sensitive to the definition of @xmath116 .",
    "we obtain @xmath117 using the m96 value of @xmath116 , 1.5@xmath103 larger than our estimate of @xmath106 ( @xmath118 ) . taking the value of @xmath113 from the limit of our survey , @xmath119 , in agreement with our infall estimate .",
    "the sensitivity of the cye estimator to the aperture used to measure @xmath116 may affect many of the results from studies of cnoc clusters because the properties of the composite cnoc cluster depend on the estimates of @xmath101 for individual clusters .",
    "based on the infall mass profile , we can predict the velocity dispersion profile with an assumption about the distribution of galaxy orbits .",
    "we assume that orbits are isotropic at all radii ( @xmath120 ) , and calculate the velocity dispersion profiles for the hernquist and nfw models ( @xcite , equation 10 ; nfw , equation 3 ) . these predicted velocity dispersion profiles agree with the observed profile ( figure [ figvdp ] ) .",
    "the largest differences are at the radii where the caustic amplitude is unstable . without fitting any parameters",
    ", we find @xmath121 and 59 for 14 degrees of freedom for the hernquist and nfw profiles respectively .",
    "this result provides a consistency check on the infall mass profile and confirms that a hernquist profile models the data better than an nfw profile .",
    "the two most commonly used kinematic mass estimators for clusters are the virial mass estimator and the projected mass estimator ( @xcite ) .",
    "these estimators both assume that clusters are relaxed systems .",
    "numerical simulations , however , suggest that both of these mass estimators typically overestimate the true mass profile of a relaxed cluster by @xmath122 ( @xcite )",
    ".    if clusters are not relaxed , these estimators may provide more substantial overestimates of the mass .",
    "figure [ figcmassprof ] shows the virial mass estimates of a576 calculated by girardi et al .",
    "( 1998 ) from the m96 data .",
    "they report both the standard virial mass and a corrected virial mass which includes a correction for the surface pressure term estimated from the galaxy distribution .",
    "this correction assumes that light traces mass , or more precisely , that the number density of galaxies traces mass .",
    "girardi et al .",
    "also use the galaxy number density profile to estimate the mass of a576 at small radius for comparison with x - ray estimates .",
    "m96 show that their data allow a wide range of masses ( @xmath123 ) depending on the mass estimator , the magnitude cutoff , and the definition of cluster members .",
    "in particular , emission dominated galaxies have a larger velocity dispersion than absorption dominated galaxies .",
    "the virial mass of emission line galaxies is a factor of @xmath124 larger than the virial mass of absorption line galaxies ( m96 ; @xcite ) .",
    "note , however , that when we combine the galaxy number density and the velocity dispersion profiles in the jeans equation , the two subsamples should yield consistent mass profiles ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "this distribution shows a background concentration of galaxies at @xmath177 ; these galaxies concentrate in a region @xmath178 from the center of a576 ( figure [ figbkgdstuff ] ) .",

    "by correcting the luminosity function for the background counts ( @xmath108 ) , we obtain the luminosity function shown in figure [ figlumfns ] . because we explicitly assume that few faint member galaxies are present at large radii , we are unable to constrain the faint - end slope of the luminosity function .",

    "however , this exercise shows that a decreasing profile yields a much better fit than a flat one .",
    "we note again that the light profile is the two - dimensional projection of the three - dimensional light profile ; the deprojected mass - to - light profile of a spherically symmetric system would decrease more steeply than the ones presented here ( see also figure [ figlightprofile ] ) .",
    "as an example , we take the best - fit hernquist mass profile , project it according to equation [ projhern ] ( assuming spherical symmetry ) , and divide it by the projected light profile . the resulting projected - mass to projected - light profile , shown in figure [ figmasstolight ] , is larger in the inner @xmath222 than the radial - mass to projected - light profile .",

    "a decreasing mass - to - light profile is perhaps surprising .",
    "one immediately wonders what systematic effects could mimic a decreasing @xmath7 profile .",
    "is the mass profile incorrect ?",
    "the infall mass profile yields larger values than x - ray estimates in the inner regions and lower values than virial theorem estimates in the outer region .",
    "non - thermal pressure support , nonisothermality , and deviations from virial equilibrium are plausible explanations for these effects . another unknown systematic effect is the actual distribution of galaxy orbits .",

    "the infall mass profile itself is uncertain by a factor of 2 .",
    "hidden systematic effects could affect the shape of the mass profile , a possibility we plan to explore with other systems .",
    "the infall mass profile is unstable from @xmath226 mpc , but beyond this range , @xmath7 continues to decrease even though the mass profile is well determined .",
    "a jeans analysis of the virial region will provide an interesting check on the infall mass profile ( @xcite ) ; preliminary results suggest good agreement between the infall mass profile and the jeans mass profile .",
    "we note also that the x - ray mass found by white et al .",
    "( 1997 ) provides a lower mass limit at small radius . while this mass estimate is smaller than the infall mass estimate , it is not sufficient to reconcile the observations with a constant mass - to - light ratio .",

    "the shape of the @xmath7 profile is insensitive to the magnitude limit .",
    "the surface number density profile also supports a larger scale for the galaxies than for the mass .",
    "we note that any systematic underestimate of total galaxy light ( e.g. , missing halo light ) would likely affect the magnitudes of all galaxies .",
    "such an effect would change the absolute value of @xmath7 but would be unlikely to alter the shape of the profile .",
    "are projection effects skewing our results ? according to the infall model , the mass profile is a true radial profile ; the light profile is the two - dimensional projection of the actual light profile . assuming that luminosity density decreases monotonically with radius , the projected light profile is steeper than the actual light profile .",
    "this effect would increase the significance of the decreasing mass - to - light profiles presented here .",
    "departures from spherical symmetry could also affect the mass - to - light profile ; looking down the barrel of a prolate spheroid would exaggerate the decrease in m / l ; looking at the disc of an oblate spheroid would mitigate it .",

    "analysis of other systems should provide an important check on these projection effects .",
    "is the decreasing mass - to - light profile an effect of calculating the luminosity from r - band photometry ?",
    "galaxies in the cores of clusters are redder than those far outside the cores .",
    "this effect causes the r - band light density profile to decrease more steeply with radius than a b - band light density profile . this effect would oppose the apparent trend of a radially decreasing mass - to - light profile .",
    "m96 demonstrate that the emission - dominated galaxies have different kinematic properties than absorption - dominated galaxies . on this basis",
    ", m96 removes the light contribution from emission - dominated galaxies in calculating the mass - to - light ratio . because many of these emission - dominated galaxies are in the infall region but probably not inside the virial radius , the mass - to - light profile is biased low in the central regions and high in the outer regions .",
    "finally , we note a curious feature of the d99 simulations . for @xmath229 models , the mass - to - light profiles ( in b band relative to the global value )",
    "show a decreasing trend similar to that shown here .",
    "clusters in a @xmath230 model produce the opposite effect , mass - to - light profiles which increase with radius .",
    "d99 attributes this effect to the deficit of blue galaxies in the centers of clusters in the @xmath229 model , but later analysis reveals a similar effect for mass - to - light profiles measured in i band .",

    "we calculate the mass profile of abell 576 to @xmath1 from the observed infall pattern in redshift space . the amplitude of the resulting mass profile is larger than determined from x - ray observations to their limiting radius of 0.5 @xmath231 mpc and smaller than virial mass estimates at larger radius .",
    "the infall mass profile agrees extremely well with an nfw profile or a hernquist ( 1990 ) profile , and it is strongly inconsistent with an isothermal sphere profile .",
    "this result agrees well with a similar analysis of coma by gdk .",
    "our best - fit mass profile implies that the fraction of gravitational mass contained in hot gas increases with radius to the limit of the x - ray data , in agreement with previous studies of other clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and simulations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the hot gas therefore appears to be more extended than the dark matter .",
    "the decreasing amplitude of the caustics suggests that the mass increases more slowly than for an isothermal sphere .",
    "this inference is supported by fitting mass profiles to the data .",
    "gdk found that the nfw profile describes the mass profile of coma much more accurately than an isothermal sphere profile , and figure 1 of cye clearly shows the existence of radially decreasing caustics in the composite cnoc cluster .",
    "many clusters therefore show evidence of mass profiles shallower than an isothermal sphere ; the masses of clusters probably increase no faster than @xmath232 at large radius .",
    "using photometric data from a large area surrounding the cluster , we find little evidence for luminosity segregation .",
    "in fact , there is some evidence of luminosity antisegregation ; the three brightest cluster galaxies lie far outside the center of the cluster .",
    "the r - band mass - to - light ratio is largest in the core ( @xmath216 ) and decreases smoothly to the limiting radius @xmath217  mpc , where @xmath233 .",
    "the decrease is more dramatic in the differential mass - to - light profile . at the limit of our sample , @xmath234 .",
    "the luminosity density from the century survey is @xmath235mpc@xmath236 which yields @xmath237 ( @xcite ) .",
    "our estimate of the global value of @xmath12 thus implies @xmath238 , or @xmath239 at a 95% confidence level .",
    "this estimate of @xmath240 is an upper limit due to the unknown contribution of faint ( @xmath241 ) galaxies .",
    "note that using the luminosity function parameters from the lcrs ( @xcite ) yields a significantly smaller luminosity density corresponding to @xmath242 . adopting this luminosity density reduces our estimate of the matter density to @xmath243 .",
    "the decreasing @xmath12 profile suggests that the dark matter is more concentrated than the optical light of the galaxies .",
    "we consider possible systematic effects ( @xmath26 ) and find that they generally oppose the decreasing mass - to - light ratio .",
    "if general , our results place strong constraints on possible variations of mass - to - light ratios with scale as well as on the global value of @xmath240 .",
    "photometric observations in other bandpasses would allow an examination of the effects of stellar populations on the mass - to - light profile .",
    "similar studies of other clusters , particularly studies of clusters with better defined infall regions at large radius , should test the generality of our results .",
    "this project would not have been possible without the assistance of perry berlind and michael calkins , the remote observers at flwo , and susan tokarz , who processed the spectroscopic data .",
