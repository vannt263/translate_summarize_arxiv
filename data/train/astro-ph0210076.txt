    "the following assumptions and conditions are necessary for a light curve to yield a unique solution of planet and star parameters : + @xmath1 the planet orbit is circular ( valid for tidally - circularized extrasolar planets ) ; + @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 and the companion is dark compared to the central star ; + @xmath1 the stellar mass - radius relation is known ; + @xmath1 the light comes from a single star , rather than from 2 or more blended stars ; + @xmath1 the eclipses have flat bottoms .",
    "this implies that the companion is fully superimposed on the central star s disk and requires that the data is in a band pass where limb darkening is negligible ; + @xmath1 the period can be derived from the light curve ( e.g. , the two observed eclipses are consecutive ) .",
    "+ in this article @xmath5 is mass , @xmath6 is radius , @xmath7 is density , @xmath8 is period , @xmath9 is orbital semi - major axis , @xmath10 is the orbital inclination , and @xmath11 is the gravitational constant . where required",
    "the subscript @xmath12 is for planet , @xmath13 for stellar , and @xmath14 for solar .",
    "five equations are used to uniquely solve for @xmath4 , @xmath15 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath16 .",
    "the simplified equations presented below require the additional assumption that @xmath17 .",

    "this breaks the geometrical degeneracy and allows a unique solution .",
    "the five parameters @xmath4 , @xmath15 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath16 can be solved for uniquely from the above five equations . moreover",

    "the above analytical solution has many applications , all related to selecting the best transit candidates for radial velocity mass follow - up . here",
    "we only have room to describe one application ; for others see seager & malln - ornelas ( 2002 ) .",
    "the stellar density @xmath30 can be uniquely determined from the light curve alone without using the stellar mass - radius relation , as seen from equation  ( 7 ) .",
    "a measured @xmath30 can be used in three ways .",
    "( 1 ) from the light curve alone a main sequence star and a giant star can be distinguished because main sequence stars occupy a unique position in a @xmath30 vs. spectral type diagram ( figure  1 ) .",
    "hence a giant star with an eclipsing stellar companion can be ruled out .",
    "( 2 ) from the light curve and the stellar mass - radius relation @xmath16 can be estimated ( equation  ( 12 ) ) .",
    "even for slightly evolved stars an upper limit on @xmath15 and hence @xmath16 can be derived .",
    "( 3 ) a common false positive planet transit can be ruled out by comparing @xmath30 derived from the light curve with @xmath30 derived from a spectral type .",
    "if the two @xmath30 differ then something is amiss with the assumptions in  1 .",
    "the common case is the situation where a binary star system has its eclipse depth reduced to a planet - size eclipse due to the light from a third , contaminating , star ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the contaminating star may be a chance alignment of a foreground or background star , or a third star as part of a triple star system . for a real example of this `` blended star '' situation , see malln - ornelas et al ."
