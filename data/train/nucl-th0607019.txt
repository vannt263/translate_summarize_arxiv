    "the main quantity of interest in this work is the s - wave @xmath8-nucleon scattering amplitude ( f@xmath10 ) displayed in fig 1 .",
    "this particular description of the real and imaginary parts of the @xmath8-nucleon scattering amplitude is obtained in the relativistic coupled - channel scheme of ref .  .",
    "its main features are however derived in other approaches as well , for example the k - matrix coupled - channel calculation of ref .  .",
    "the most striking feature is the shape of the real part of the s - wave @xmath8-nucleon scattering amplitude close to threshold ( @xmath11 = 1.486 gev ) .",
    "the narrow spike in the vicinity of the @xmath8-nucleon threshold implies that physics will change very rapidly with the invariant @xmath4 pair mass in this region .",
    "in particular , the threshold value of re f@xmath10 will decrease significantly in nuclei where the @xmath8-meson scatters from bound nucleons .",
    "the imaginary part of the amplitude is dominated by the n*(1535 ) resonance and hence peaks close to the resonance nominal mass .",
    "because the n*(1535 ) resonance lies only 49 mev above threshold , the invariant mass region sensitive to the real part of the amplitude is quite restricted and limited to @xmath8-nucleon pair total center of mass energy within @xmath1225 mev of threshold .",
    "the @xmath8-nucleon scattering amplitude displayed in fig .",
    "1 describes only s - wave dynamics and is therefore not valid beyond @xmath131.6 gev  @xcite . for future considerations , it is useful to recall that the n*@xmath14(1535 ) has the same spin and isospin as the nucleon but the opposite parity .",
    "the width of the n*(1535 ) is of the order of 150 mev .",
    "its two main decay channels are the n@xmath15 ( 35 - 55  @xmath16 ) and the n@xmath8 ( 30 - 55 @xmath16 ) final states @xcite .    the @xmath8-nucleon scattering length in the model of ref .",
    "can be read off fig .",
    "it is @xmath17=(1.03 + i 0.49 ) fm .",
    "the corresponding quantity obtained in ref .   is @xmath17=(0.91(6 ) + i 0.27(2 ) ) fm .",
    "the range of values found in the literature for re @xmath17 ( from @xmath12 0.3 to @xmath121 fm ) is however much broader than these two values suggest@xcite and reflects the indirect nature of the determination of re @xmath17 from @xmath8-meson production reactions such as @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , etc ...    the purpose of this work is to show that the @xmath0 process in specific kinematic conditions is most sensitive to the @xmath8-nucleon scattering at threshold .",
    "these conditions are twofold . on the one hand",
    "the @xmath1 invariant mass in the final state should be close to its threshold value ( m@xmath2+m@xmath3 ) and not much larger than the n*(1535 ) resonance mass .",
    "on the other hand the initial photon energy should be sufficiently high , typically in the range @xmath5 gev , in order to reach low ( absolute ) values of the squared 4-momentum transfer from the initial photon to the final @xmath6-meson ( @xmath22 1 gev@xmath23 ) .",
    "the latter constraint is needed to ensure that the description of the @xmath0 reaction by a meson - exchange picture be legitimate .",
    "we discuss our t - channel meson - exchange picture of the @xmath0 reaction in section 2 .",
    "we present numerical results and concluding remarks in section 3 .",
    "a more extended version of this study can be found in ref .  .",
    "in the restricted kinematics defined above , we expect t - channel meson - exchanges to drive the dynamics underlying the @xmath0 process .",
    "there are both experimental data and theoretical arguments to justify this statement .",
    "recent measurements of the @xmath25 reaction by saphir at elsa@xcite ( @xmath26 2.4 gev ) , by clas at jlab@xcite ( @xmath27 3.5 gev ) and leps at spring-8@xcite ( @xmath26 2.37 gev ) all indicate that the differential cross sections @xmath28 are peaked at forward angles .",
    "this feature is more pronounced with increasing photon energy .",
    "this behavior suggests that t - channel exchanges dominate the @xmath6 photoproduction dynamics at low t for photon energies of a few gev .",
    "the theoretical issue is to single out the exchanges which are the most significant . in the case of the @xmath25 reaction , scalar and pseudoscalar mesons as well as pomerons",
    "can be exchanged@xcite .",
    "the calculated cross sections , and hence the relative importance of these exchanges , depend very much on the description of the vertices ( coupling constants and form factors ) .",
    "it is therefore quite difficult to disentangle the different contributions .    in the case of the @xmath0 process",
    ", the negative parity of the n*(1535 ) implies that the photoproduction of a @xmath6-meson associated with the excitation of the target proton into a n*(1535 ) resonance be induced by a pseudoscalar exchange .",
    "there are only two terms , the @xmath7- and the @xmath8-exchanges depicted in fig .",
    "@xmath29 \\epsfxsize=2 in \\epsffile{fig2acracovie.eps } &      \\epsfxsize=2 in      \\epsffile{fig2bcracovie.eps } \\\\ [ 0.4 cm ] \\end{array}$ ]    the dynamical inputs of our calculation are therefore the @xmath30 and the @xmath31 vertices and the @xmath32 and @xmath33 scattering amplitudes .",
    "the @xmath30 and the @xmath31 vertices are described by the anomalous interaction lagrangian @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the electromagnetic field tensor , @xmath36 and @xmath37 denotes the chiral pseudoscalar mesons of interest , the pion or the @xmath8-meson . using this interaction lagrangian to calculate the @xmath38 and @xmath39 partial widths , we can derive the values of the coupling constants from the measured partial widths@xcite .",
    "we find @xmath40 on the basis of these couplings only , the pion - exchange contribution to the cross section will be suppressed by a factor of the order of 29 compared to the @xmath8-exchange contribution .",
    "this suppression factor is about 5 for the @xmath41 interference",
    ". this interference may therefore be significant .",
    "its sign can not be determined unambiguously from available data ( see the discussion of ref .  ) .",
    "we consider therefore both constructive and destructive interferences in the presentation of the numerical results .",
    "the @xmath32 and @xmath33 s - wave scattering amplitudes used to calculate the @xmath0 cross section were obtained in the relativistic , unitary coupled - channel model of ref .  .",
    "this approach reproduces a large set of pion - nucleon and photon - nucleon scattering data in the energy range @xmath42 gev , in particular the pion- and photon - induced @xmath8-meson production cross sections close to threshold .",
    "the n*(1535 ) resonance of interest in this work is generated dynamically through meson - baryon scattering using the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "the @xmath33 amplitude is shown in fig . 1 and the @xmath32 amplitude in fig .",
    "3 . one should note that the s - wave @xmath32 amplitude is significantly smaller than the @xmath33 amplitude close to the @xmath8-meson threshold , suppressing further the pion - exchange contribution to the @xmath0 cross section .",
    "the squared amplitudes corresponding to the @xmath15-exchange , the @xmath8-exchange and their interference are @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45    we assume in the derivation of these equations that the @xmath46 and @xmath47 transition form factors are one .",
    "this is a choice based on dynamical considerations outlined in ref .   in the absence of direct constraints from data .",
    "there is an obvious uncertainty linked to that assumption .",
    "if the @xmath46 and @xmath47 transition form factors turned out to be soft , the differential cross sections , d@xmath48/dt , could be significantly different .",
    "our model takes into account the @xmath8-nucleon final state interaction to all orders , but does not treat @xmath6-nucleon rescattering in the outgoing channel .",
    "we do not expect this rescattering to be very important in the kinematics under consideration , i.e. with a large relative momentum between the @xmath6-meson emitted at small angles and the recoiling target products .    before showing results , it is useful to comment on the kinematics of the @xmath24 reaction . at the @xmath6 threshold ,",
    "@xmath49=3 gev and @xmath50 is 1.2 gev@xmath23 .",
    "this number is obtained assuming the invariant mass of the @xmath8p pair to be the n*(1535 ) mass .",
    "meson - exchange models are expected to be valid at low @xmath51 ( @xmath22 1 gev@xmath23 ) .",
    "we consider therefore values of @xmath49 significantly above threshold . in this paper , we display results for @xmath49=4 gev where @xmath50 is 0.38 gev@xmath23 .",
    "we refer to ref .   for a similar study at 5 gev , where @xmath50 is 0.26 gev@xmath23 .",
    "we have calculated differential cross sections for the @xmath24 reaction at two values of invariant mass of the @xmath1 pair ( denoted @xmath52 ) , chosen to be sensitive to the real and to the imaginary parts of the s - wave @xmath4 scattering amplitude .",
    "we consider @xmath52= 1.49 gev ( where the real and the imaginary parts are of comparable importance ) and @xmath52= 1.54 gev ( where the imaginary part is largely dominant ) .",
    "the different curves illustrate the features and uncertainties of our calculation .",
    "the full and dashed lines are the total differential cross sections assuming a destructive and a constructive @xmath7-@xmath8 interference respectively .",
    "the dot - dashed and dotted lines are the contributions of the @xmath8-meson and of the @xmath7-exchanges .",
    "we remark first that @xmath7-exchange contribution is negligible as expected .",
    "the @xmath8-meson exchange is clearly the dominant contribution to the @xmath24 cross section , hence justifying our primary motivation to use that particular reaction to study the @xmath54 amplitude close to threshold .",
    "the full and dashed lines are indicative of the importance of the @xmath55 interference .",
    "depending on the relative sign of the coupling constants @xmath56 and @xmath57 , the differential cross section decreases ( like signs ) or increases ( opposite signs ) by @xmath58 .",
    "if the @xmath55 interference is constructive , the pole structure of the @xmath8-exchange and of the interference leads to a rather sharp t - dependence close to @xmath59 .",
    "this effect will increase with increasing laboratory photon energy as a lower @xmath50 can be reached .",
    "if the @xmath55 interference is destructive , the terms driving the increase of the differential cross section at low @xmath51 cancel significantly , leading to a rather flat behavior .    in general , the cross section is rather small as a consequence of the value of @xmath52 , which is very close to the @xmath4 threshold .",
    "we refrain from performing an integration over @xmath60 in view of the fact that our model is not valid for @xmath61 1 gev@xmath23 .",
    "the features of the results are quite similar to those observed on fig .",
    "the main difference is that the cross section is roughly twice larger , as a consequence of the opening of phase space for the @xmath4 final state .      in the kinematics where the @xmath1 invariant mass in the final state lies between the threshold value ( m@xmath2+m@xmath3 ) and the n*(1535 ) resonance mass ,",
    "the @xmath24 reaction is largely determined by the @xmath4 scattering amplitude close to threshold .",
    "the most appropriate range of initial photon energy is @xmath5 gev , in order to reach low ( absolute ) values of the squared 4-momentum transfer and to be able to rely on meson - exchange pictures .",
    "the actual magnitude of the @xmath24 reaction cross section depends significantly on the relative sign of the coupling constants @xmath56 and @xmath57 . an independent determination of that sign would be very useful .",
    "finally , accurate data on the @xmath24 reaction taken at @xmath5 gev and involving t - distributions at different @xmath1 invariant masses would clearly contribute to the understanding of the @xmath1 scattering amplitude in the threshold region .",
    "one of us ( m. s. ) thanks the organizers of the meson2006 workshop for giving her the opportunity to present this work in a stimulating context where @xmath8-nucleon physics close to threshold was thoroughly discussed .",
