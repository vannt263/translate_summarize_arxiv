    "for decades it has been known that deviations from exponential decay in quantum systems exist under quite general conditions , both on extremely short and very long time scales @xcite .",
    "the short time scale deviations typically give rise to parabolic decay ; rapidly repeated measurements of the system on this timescale may give rise to either the quantum zeno or quantum anti - zeno effects , resulting in decelerated or accelerated decay , respectively .",
    "however , these effects typically occur on quite short timescales , before giving way to the more familiar exponential decay , and hence experimental study was elusive for several decades ; it is only relatively recently that these effects were experimentally verified @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , it was khalfin @xcite , relying on the paley - wiener theorem @xcite , who showed that a quantum system that is bounded below necessarily gives rise to non - exponential decay on asymptotic timescales ; an alternative proof that does not rely on the paley - wiener theorem was provided by hack @xcite . however , the timescales on which the non - exponential effects manifest typically exceed several lifetimes , after which the survival probability is usually quite depleted , again posing an experimental challenge .",
    "it is therefore quite recently this effect has been verified experimentally in the luminescence decay properties of dissolved organic materials following laser - excitation @xcite .",
    "the recent advances in the fabrication of nano - scale devices and cold atom trapping provide an optimistic outlook for deeper studies in this direction , particularly given the previous success in detecting non - exponential decay at short times for sodium atoms initially trapped in an accelerating optical potential @xcite .",
    "the long - time deviation , which typically takes the form of an inverse power law , is intimately connected with the properties of the continuum and particularly the threshold . as an example , for a particle initially trapped in a shallow inner potential well it has been shown that as one varies the strength of a repulsive outer inverse square potential , the exponent of the power law varies in a predictable manner @xcite .",
    "in another study , it has been shown for a radial potential that for the @xmath3-wave component of the wave function as one brings the energy of an initially prepared unstable state ( a resonant state initially localized in the inner well ) close to the threshold that the exponential decay can be completely suppressed , resulting in power law decay on all time scales @xcite .",
    "a similar effect is demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite as a resonant state approaches the threshold in a semiconductor double barrier quantum structure .",
    "none of the three above studies , however , consider the effect of bound states on the power law decay .",
    "a semi - infinite tight - binding chain with an endpoint impurity is considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which case exponential decay is again suppressed , however , in this case the effect is associated with the appearance of a bound state . the same effect is observed in an equivalent model in ref .",
    "@xcite , as well as in a semi - infinite chain with a two - level endpoint impurity in ref . @xcite . in the latter two studies , an intensification of the power law decay",
    "is associated with the appearance or dissolution of a bound state ( i.e. a transition from a localized state to a virtual state in the language of ref .",
    "we also note that the effect of a bound state near threshold on the non - exponential decay is considered from a more mathematical perspective in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , the analysis presented in that work is not rooted in any specific physical hamiltonian but rather the authors place conditions on the spectrum itself . for example , they assume that an unperturbed bound state appearing directly at threshold can not result in a bound state shifted below the threshold under the influence of the interaction with the continuum",
    ". however , this assumption is contradicted by both of the physical models considered in this paper , as well those studied in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the following study",
    ", we consider more closely the role that the bound state plays in relation to the non - exponential decay in open quantum systems .",
    "in particular , we show that in the case that a bound state approaches the energy continuum , there are two different temporal regions in which the leading term in the power law expansion takes on different exponents ; we term these the long time `` near zone '' and the long time `` far zone . '' and the far zone or casimir - polder zone in which it falls off as @xmath4 .",
    "finally there is a characteristic length separating these two zones , fixed by the energy gap between the two levels @xcite . ]",
    "the power law decay in the near zone is enhanced relative to that in the far zone and the time scale @xmath2 that separates the two zones is inversely related to the gap between the bound state energy and the continuum threshold .",
    "hence as the bound state approaches the threshold the time scale @xmath2 grows larger , resulting in the amplified near zone decay extending over longer and longer time scales . finally , in the case that bound state is absorbed into the continuum at the threshold ( meaning that the bound state is destabilized as it vanishes from the diagonalized hamiltonian spectrum ) the time scale @xmath2 diverges and the near zone description becomes the fully asymptotic large time behavior .    on the other side of this transition , an anti - bound state forms in the second riemann sheet",
    ", meanwhile the long time far zone behavior is restored in the asymptotic limit .",
    "hence , one could just as well view this transition in reverse : an anti - bound state approaches the energy continuum , and the power law decay is amplified at precisely the point that the anti - bound state touches the continuum edge before being ejected from the continuum as a bound state .",
    "indeed , the power law decay is easier to study in the latter case as neither a bound nor a resonance appear in the spectrum ( at least , for the model that we consider below ) , leaving the power law as the most pronounced effect in the time evolution @xcite .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : gen ] below we present our argument that the power law decay is amplified as the bound state approaches the continuum threshold ( or the edge of the conduction band in solid state terms ) and in sec . [ sec : gen.bound.states ] we discuss two cases for open quantum systems : in one case the bound state is prevented from reaching the continuum threshold due to a divergent van hove singularity in the density of states while in the other the form of the interaction potential modifies the system properties and allows the bound state to reach the continuum edge , resulting in a divergence for the timescale @xmath2 . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mod ] we look at two model realizations of these effects : in sec . [ sec : modi ] we study an infinitely long quantum dot superlattice with a side - coupled impurity ( model i ) ; in this case the van hove singularity prevents the bound state from destabilizing at the continuum edge .",
    "meanwhile in sec .",
    "[ sec : modii ] we present the case of a similar model consisting of a semi - infinite chain with an endpoint impurity ( model ii ) ; here the bound state may reach the continuum edge , resulting in the divergence of the timescale @xmath2 .",

    "here we consider an open quantum system with a generic hamiltonian of the form @xmath5 consisting of a discrete state with creation operator @xmath6 coupled to the field operator @xmath7 through the coupling potential @xmath8 .",
    "the discrete state has energy @xmath9 while the continuum is given by the dispersion @xmath10 , which we suppose extends from a lower threshold @xmath11 to an upper threshold @xmath12 .",
    "typically , in atomic , molecular , and optical systems we will only have a lower threshold while @xmath12 is taken to infinity , while in condensed matter systems both thresholds are finite as they delimit the edges of the conduction band .    for our purposes",
    "we tend to focus in this paper on studies of the time evolution when the discrete energy @xmath9 is in the vicinity of the lower threshold @xmath11 . in this case",
    ", the upper threshold will generally have negligible impact on the survival probability ; hence , for our purposes in this section we might as well simply refer to @xmath13 as ` the system threshold ' and assume that @xmath12 is largely inconsequential ( or simply taken to infinity @xmath14 ) .",
    "we solve for the discrete spectrum of the full hamiltonian by calculating the green s function for the discrete state @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the self - energy function that determines how the perturbed system eigenvalues are shifted from the unperturbed energy @xmath9 .",
    "more precisely we may write @xmath16 as @xmath17 in which @xmath18 is analytic for all @xmath19 , meanwhile @xmath20 represents the non - analytic component of @xmath16 ; specifically @xmath20 is undefined along the branch cut associated with the continuum @xmath10 .",

    "( [ gen.disc.disp ] ) is simply a @xmath19-dependent factor that might need to be multiplied through to obtain a polynomial .",
    "let us further assume that for values @xmath32 there exists a single bound state in the spectrum with eigenvalue @xmath33 , which satisfies @xmath34 ( since we are dealing with an open system , the other eigenvalues might be any combination of anti - bound states , resonant states or anti - resonant states ) .",
    "however , if we increase the value of @xmath9 such that @xmath35 then consequently the bound state energy approaches the threshold @xmath36 .",
    "at the precise value @xmath37 the bound state reaches the continuum threshold @xmath38 and is absorbed @xcite .",

    "further , for model i the divergent van hove singularity in the density of states at the edge of the continuum prevented the bound state from being able to reach the band edge and closing the gap @xmath44 ( that is to say , there was a persistent bound state as defined in ref .",

    "( [ inf.back.int.near.zone.asymp ] ) would vanish anyways .",
    "however , for model ii the precise form of the interaction potential essentially cancels out the divergence from the density of states , which results in a spectrum in which it is possible to close the gap @xmath84 for precise values of the system parameters .",
    "doing so gives rise to a situation where the enhanced power law decay associated with the long time near zone pushes out the far zone behavior entirely and dominates the time evolution in the fully asymptotic limit .",
    "interestingly , it has also been demonstrated in open quantum systems that the same crossover from a bound state to an anti - bound state at the continuum threshold gives rise to a maximum in the local density of states response function at the impurity site @xcite .",

    "the @xmath1 behavior in the far zone appears to be a rather generic feature @xcite . on the other hand , one would hope to obtain a more general understanding of the near zone behavior .",

    "this will be a future direction of study .    finally for completeness",
    "we note that even the typical exponential decay itself experiences anomalous behavior in the vicinity of the threshold . as has been pointed out in quite different physical contexts , fermi s golden rule , which predicts that the decay rate to lowest order approximation is proportional to the density of states , breaks down in the vicinity of a singularity in the density of states @xcite ."
