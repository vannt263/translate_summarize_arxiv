    "the recent discovery of iron arsenide superconductors@xcite brought renewed interest in the research of high - temperature superconductors . with transition temperatures @xmath3 of more than @xmath4k in some cases ,",
    "these compounds present a very rich phase diagram displaying superconducting ( sc ) , antiferromagnetic ( afm ) and structural order@xcite . in some pnictides , such as @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 ,",
    "the competing sc and afm phases seem to be separated by a first - order transition and can only coexist in phase - separated macroscopic regions of the sample@xcite .",
    "however , in other compounds , like @xmath9 and possibly@xcite @xmath10 , local probes@xcite as well as bulk measurements@xcite demonstrated that sc and afm coexist homogeneously .",
    "this coexistence , however , is characterized by a competition of the two ordered states : neutron diffraction experiments@xcite revealed the dramatic suppression of the magnetization below @xmath3 , to the extent that reentrance of the non - magnetically ordered phase sets in at low temperatures@xcite .",
    "experiments have also demonstrated the itinerant character of the magnetically ordered phase in the pnictides . in particular , optical conductivity measurements show a considerable drude weight as well as a pronounced mid - infrared peak below the nel transition temperature @xmath11 , consistent with the itinerant picture@xcite .",
    "furthermore , band structure calculations reveal that the crystalline field is unable to significantly split the energy levels in order to localize @xmath12 electrons@xcite .",
    "also , several theoretical models demonstrate the adequacy of the itinerant description@xcite .",
    "therefore , in the iron arsenides , the same electrons that form the superconducting condensate seem to be the ones that contribute to the ordered moment .",
    "the interplay between afm and sc has been investigated in many contexts@xcite , including the pnictides@xcite . in this paper , following results from our previous work@xcite as well as from refs.@xcite , we investigate in detail the connection between the competition of these two phases and the pairing symmetry of the sc state .",
    "we demonstrate that coexistence between sc and itinerant afm in the pnictides for temperatures close to @xmath13 is only possible if the pairing state is unconventional , as proposed by models with purely electronic pairing mechanisms@xcite . in particular ,",
    "using a mean - field hamiltonian for the competition between afm and sc and expanding the microscopic free energy in powers of the order parameters , we show that a conventional @xmath1 sc state does not allow a coexistence regime to be established around the point where the @xmath14 and @xmath15 lines meet , even for extreme values of the band structure parameters . meanwhile , the unconventional @xmath0 state , whose gap function changes sign from one fermi surface sheet to the other , may or may not coexist with afm , depending on the details of the band structure dispersion relations . specifically , for the parameters of @xmath9 , we find that the @xmath0 state coexists with itinerant afm , while the @xmath1 state does not ( see figure [ fig_phase_diagrams ] ) .",
    "our results rely solely on the general assumptions that the magnetism is itinerant and that the band structure of the iron pnictides is not far from particle - hole symmetry , consisting of two distinct sets of fermi surface sheets@xcite : hole pockets located at the center of the brillouin zone and electron pockets displaced from the zone center by the magnetic ordering vector * @xmath16*. additional details of the band structure , the dimensionality of the system or the presence of intraband pairing interactions do not change the conclusions . on the other hand , for a localized afm state , the free energy expansion reveals that coexistence is easily attained , which is difficult to reconcile with the observation of phase separation in some compounds .",
    "our analysis also indicates that the onset of sc has little effect on localized moments , which is at odds with experimental observations as well , giving further evidence for the itinerant magnetism in the pnictides .     for a superconducting @xmath0 state ( a ) and an @xmath1 state ( b ) , obtained by numerically solving the gap equations .",
    "the green region denotes homogeneous , microscopic coexistence , whereas the dark red region denotes heterogeneous , macroscopic coexistence .",
    "the band structure parameters are discussed in section iv - b .",
    "[ fig_phase_diagrams ] ]     for a superconducting @xmath0 state ( a ) and an @xmath1 state ( b ) , obtained by numerically solving the gap equations .",
    "the green region denotes homogeneous , microscopic coexistence , whereas the dark red region denotes heterogeneous , macroscopic coexistence .",
    "the band structure parameters are discussed in section iv - b . [ fig_phase_diagrams ] ]    we also investigate in detail the origin of the strong dependence of the phase diagram on the symmetry of the cooper pair wavefunction . expressing the ginzburg - landau coefficients in terms of feynman diagrams , it becomes clear that the static staggered magnetic moment @xmath17 plays the role of an intrinsic interband josephson coupling .",
    "specifically , it corresponds to a term in the free energy of the form :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the relative phase between the sc order parameters of the two fermi surface sheets , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "thus , the coexistence state in some iron arsenides naturally carries information about the relative phase of the cooper pair wavefunctions , which are usually accessible only through intricate and delicate interference experiments@xcite .",
    "the quasiparticle excitation spectrum is substantially different for distinct pairing symmetries .",
    "for the special case of particle - hole symmetric bands , the system with competing magnetism and @xmath1 pairing have two distinct positive eigenvalues @xmath22 with @xmath23 , whereas for @xmath0 pairing the positive eigenvalues are degenerate : @xmath24 .",
    "we find that this special form of the excitation energy in the @xmath0 case implies that all quartic ( and higher order ) ginzburg - landau terms must depend solely on the combination @xmath25 , which is the root of the so@xmath2 symmetry of the system and , ultimately , what leads to the conclusion that afm and sc are in the borderline of coexistence and mutual exclusion .",
    "inclusion of local moments add new terms to the free energy , removing the system from this borderline regime .",
    "in this paper we also investigate some specific properties of the coexistence afm - sc phase .",
    "we find that the effects of coulomb repulsion on the magnetic superconducting phase are basically the same as in the case of a pure multiband superconductor .",
    "particularly , the @xmath0 state is remarkably stable with respect to an uniform coulomb repulsion .",
    "we also studied analytically the shape of the reentrant nel transition line inside the sc state for low temperatures . at the mean - field level",
    ", the finite sc gap introduces an overall energy scale that causes the nel line to have a divergent slope as @xmath26 .",
    "quantum fluctuations , which are relevant only in a very small region , end up suppressing the reentrant behavior .",
    "the competition between afm and sc explains the suppression of @xmath3 in the underdoped side of the feas phase diagram . here",
    ", we investigate the suppression of sc on the overdoped side as well .",
    "we find that the changes in the fermi surface with doping are crucial to kill sc , in agreement to arpes measurements@xcite .",
    "in particular , the vanishing of one of the fermi surface pockets marks the onset of a regime where @xmath3 is strongly suppressed with doping . in this regime , the @xmath0 state is fragile and easily destroyed by the coulomb repulsion , contrasting to the situation where all fermi pockets are present .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we discuss the competition between afm and sc solely on phenomenological grounds . in section iii we introduce the mean - field hamiltonian and derive the gap equations , the quasiparticle excitation spectrum and the free energy expansion .",
    "section iv is devoted to the application of the formalism developed in section iii to the iron arsenides , and is divided in @xmath27 subsections . in section",
    "iv - a , we present the results in the special case of a particle - hole symmetric band structure .",
    "section iv - b contains both analytical and numerical results for various band structures without particle - hole symmetry .",
    "phase diagrams for parameters describing @xmath9 are presented . in section iv - c ,",
    "we briefly discuss the regime where the sign of the coefficient that couples the afm and sc order parameters becomes negative , and how it can be avoided by the onset of incommensurate afm .",
    "section iv - d discusses the effects of intraband interactions and coulomb repulsion . in section iv - e ,",
    "we determine analytically the shape of the reentrant nel transition line at low temperatures and the corrections due to fluctuations . in section v we solve the same model presented in section iii , but now with localized magnetic moments instead of itinerant afm .",
    "section vi discusses the suppression of @xmath3 in the overdoped side of the pnictides phase diagram , and how it is related to the doping evolution of the fermi surface .",
    "section vii is devoted to the conclusions and , in appendix a , we derive the ginzburg - landau coefficients in terms of feynman diagrams .",
    "some of the results have been published in a short publication@xcite .",
    "regardless of the microscopic details , the competition between superconductivity and antiferromagnetism near their finite temperature phase transitions can be described in terms of a ginzburg - landau theory of coupled order parameters .",
    "the homogeneous part of the free energy is given as    @xmath28    where @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote the sc and afm order parameters , respectively .",
    "as usual , @xmath29 is a complex order parameter , characterized by an amplitude and a phase , and @xmath30 is a three component vector .",
    "the leading term in the order parameter competition is characterized by the coefficient @xmath31 , where the sign of @xmath32 reflects that both ordered states compete . as usual ,",
    "the quadratic coefficients are given by @xmath33 and @xmath34 and change sign at @xmath35 and @xmath36 , denoting the nel and sc transition temperatures without order parameter competition .",
    "we consider the situation where the transitions for @xmath37 are second order , i.e. the quartic coefficients @xmath38 and @xmath39 are positive .    furthermore , we consider that @xmath40 and @xmath41 vary as function of a physical parameter @xmath42 that could be pressure , electron density or magnetic field . in case where both transitions meet at @xmath43 ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath44 we have a multicritical point @xmath45 in the phase diagram .",
    "the vicinity of this multicritical point is the regime where a simultaneous expansion of the order parameters is allowed .",
    "the mean - field analysis of eq.[gl ] allows for two options for the phase diagram near @xmath45 , depending if @xmath46 or @xmath47 .",
    "since we are interested in @xmath31 , it is convenient to define the dimensionless quantity@xcite @xmath48    thus , the nature of the phase diagram is determined solely by the quartic coefficients in the ginzburg - landau expansion eq.[gl ] . for @xmath49 ( i.e. @xmath50 ) , @xmath45 is a tetracritical point where two second order phase lines cross , leading to a regime in the phase diagram where simultaneous afm and sc order occurs homogeneously within the sample , see fig.[fig_tetra_bicritical]a . in this regime",
    "both phases compete , but do not exclude each other . on the other hand , if @xmath51 ( i.e @xmath52 ) the phase competition is sufficiently strong that both phases are separated by a first order transition that terminates at the bicritical point @xmath45 .",
    "notice that if the parameter @xmath42 jumps discontinuously from @xmath53 to @xmath54 at the first order transition , there is an intermediate regime @xmath55 of heterogeneous phase coexistence , see fig.[fig_tetra_bicritical]b .",
    "a sharp line of first order transitions occurs if one considers the phase diagram as function of @xmath56 , the variable that is thermodynamically conjugate to @xmath42 , see fig.[fig_tetra_bicritical]c .",
    "critical fluctuations , that go beyond this mean - field analysis , change the universal exponents near the critical temperatures and the slopes of the phase lines near @xmath45 .",
    "however , neither the generic behavior shown in fig.1 nor the quantitative criterion based on the sign of @xmath57 are changed by fluctuations@xcite .",
    "if we consider @xmath49 , both order parameters can be finite simultaneously .",
    "this regime is often referred to as _ coexistence _ of afm and sc , referring to coexistence of order .",
    "this should not be confused with phase coexistence in the thermodynamic sense .",
    "the area in fig.[fig_tetra_bicritical]a below the tetracritical point is a single thermodynamic phase characterized by two order parameters that are simultaneously finite .",
    "similarly , the tetracritical point is not a point where four phases coexist ( which would not be allowed by gibbs phase rule ) , but a point where the system is in a single phase and both order parameters are infinitesimal simultaneously . below the bicritical point ,",
    "coexistence of thermodynamic phases only occurs for @xmath55 , where macroscopic afm and sc regions occur together in the sample .",
    "we use the term _ homogeneous coexistence _ of afm and sc order below the tetracritical point to refer to coexisting order and _ heterogeneous coexistence _ below the bicritical point to refer to coexistence of phases .    from the ginzburg - landau expression ( [ gl ] ) , we obtain the temperature dependence of the magnetic moment in the sc phase in the case of homogeneous coexistence :    @xmath58        without phase competition both order parameters decrease as function of temperature , @xmath59 and @xmath60 . phase competition can change this behavior . for instance , if    @xmath61    it follows from eq .",
    "( [ magnetic_moment_sc ] ) that @xmath62 once superconductivity sets in .",
    "thus , below @xmath3 , the ordered moment decreases with decreasing temperature , as was observed in neutron diffraction experiments@xcite in both @xmath9 and@xcite @xmath63 .",
    "it is interesting that the same condition implies a back - bending of the antiferromagnetic phase boundary upon entering the superconducting state , see fig .",
    "1a . to demonstrate this we write for the bare nel temperature @xmath64 , with @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "thus , @xmath35 is a monotonic decreasing function of @xmath42 and meets the sc phase line at the carrier density or pressure value @xmath67 . without restriction",
    "we assume that @xmath36 is @xmath42-independent near @xmath67 . from the ginzburg - landau expansion eq.([gl ] ) follows that the nel temperature @xmath11 inside the sc phase is given by :    @xmath68    since @xmath65 , it follows that @xmath69 in case eq.([condition_suppression ] ) is valid . thus close to @xmath67",
    "one finds reentrance of the paramagnetic phase below the sc transition temperature . in @xmath9",
    "this was indeed observed@xcite .",
    "the observation@xcite of @xmath62 in @xmath63 implies that the phase line for this material must bend back as well .",
    "furthermore , the sc transition temperature inside the afm phase is given by :    @xmath70    using the condition eq.([condition_suppression ] ) and the fact that @xmath71 ( @xmath49 ) it automatically holds that @xmath72 , implying @xmath73 .",
    "hence , the sc transition temperature is suppressed inside the afm phase .",
    "a very interesting limit is @xmath74 , i.e. at the transition between the tetracritical point and bicritical point .",
    "focusing on this multicritical point , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 change sign simultaneously , one can introduce the five - component vector@xmath77    in case where the additional condition @xmath78 is fulfilled it follows that the free - energy can be written as : @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "this is the so@xmath82 symmetric form of the ginzburg - landau energy that was first proposed by zhang to describe the physics of the cuprate superconductors@xcite . in the context of the pnictides , it was shown@xcite that a model hamiltonian similar to the one used in this paper is invariant with respect to a global so@xmath83 symmetry that contains , in addition to the afm and sc order parameters , an imaginary density wave state . below",
    "we will see that there is evidence that the the pnictides are indeed strongly affected by such an enhanced symmetry .",
    "so far we have analyzed the problem of coexistence between sc and afm only on phenomenological grounds , which gave us interesting and general information about the phase diagram .",
    "next we develop a microscopic model that captures the essential aspects of the iron arsenides to determine their detailed phase diagram .",
    "we will also make explicit contact to the ginzburg - landau theory and determine the coefficients of the order parameter expansion to obtain the behavior close to the transition temperatures .",
    "we start from the hamiltonian : @xmath84    the non - interacting part @xmath85 describes two bands shifted by the momentum @xmath16 relative to each other :    @xmath86    we consider only one hole band located in the center of the brillouin zone with dispersion @xmath87 , and one electron band , shifted by @xmath16 from the hole band , with dispersion @xmath88 . to keep the discussion as simple as possible , but still capturing the basic properties of these materials , we consider a circular hole band and an elliptical electron band :    @xmath89    where @xmath90 is the energy offset ( see figure [ fig_band_structure ] ) .",
    "such a choice is motivated by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy@xcite ( arpes ) as well as by tight - binding fittings to first - principle band structure calculations .",
    "the operator @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) creates an electron with momentum @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) and spin @xmath95 in the hole ( electron ) band .",
    "the chemical potential is denoted by @xmath96 , and we define @xmath97 . frequently , it will be possible to gain explicit analytic insight by considering the limit of particle - hole symmetry , where @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 . in this case",
    "the hole and electron fermi surfaces are identical , leading to perfect nesting . in what follows we supplement our numerical analysis of the problem with band structure eq.([band_dispersion ] ) by analytical results at or near the limit of particle - hole symmetry .",
    "even though all five iron @xmath101-orbitals contribute to the states at the fermi surface of the iron arsenides , the physics of the competition between the antiferromagnetic and the superconducting states is well captured by this effective two - band model@xcite .     from the hole band .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath96 is positive for electron doping .",
    "[ fig_band_structure ] ]    the same electrons that form the fermi surface are assumed to be responsible for the magnetism of the system through an electronic interband coulomb interaction @xmath102 , leading to excitonic itinerant antiferromagnetism@xcite :    @xmath103    here @xmath104 denotes the @xmath105 element of the @xmath106-th pauli matrix , with @xmath107 . in the weak - coupling limit ,",
    "we perform a hartree - fock decoupling that leads , except for a constant shift in energy , to the effective single particle hamiltonian    @xmath108    where @xmath109 is the system size .",

    "for large enough @xmath110 , however , the fermi surface can become completely gapped . in the case of perfect nested bands ,",
    "an infinitesimal antiferromagnetic gap is already able to gap the entire fermi surface .",
    "note that @xmath113 is proportional to the amplitude of the staggered magnetization @xmath17 and given by :    @xmath114    besides the magnetic interaction @xmath102 , the electrons are also subject to a pairing interaction @xmath115 , where @xmath116 are band indices . in case of pure interband interaction @xmath117 the hamiltonian becomes    @xmath118    below we demonstrate that the introduction of an intraband pairing interaction does not change the main conclusions of our paper .",
    "@xmath119 is the superconducting gap of band @xmath120 which , given the interband coupling @xmath121 , is due to the action of the electrons in the opposite band @xmath122 .",

    "this is called the @xmath1 state and is analogous to the pairing state of the multiband superconductor@xcite @xmath152 .",

    "i.e. it is the natural analog to the @xmath154-pairing state in the cuprates with a single fermi surface sheet .",

    "the negative sign in front of the temperature dependent term also implies that @xmath11 is finite for @xmath342 .",
    "therefore , it correctly captures the reentrance of the afm line .",
    "the presence of the exponential term @xmath343 is a consequence of the fact that , inside the sc state , quasiparticle excitations are fully gapped . due to this exponential dependency , the reentrant @xmath11 line approaches the quantum critical point with an exponentially steep slope , i.e. as an almost vertical line .",
    "this is in agreement with our calculated phase diagrams from figure [ fig_phase_diagrams ] , as well as with the phase diagrams obtained by vorontsov _ _",

    "the presence of power - law corrections in @xmath76 is more general than our self - consistent large-@xmath109 theory , and is expected to occur due to the presence of massless critical fluctuations . due to the fact that the coefficient @xmath349 is positive , such quantum fluctuations suppress the magnetic reentrant behavior at very low temperatures .",
    "however , as usual in systems in the weak coupling regime , the critical region where quantum fluctuations are relevant is expected to be very small , and probably hard to be detected experimentally .",
    "a key conclusion of our calculation is that homogeneous coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism is only allowed in case of unconventional @xmath0-pairing state , while both ordered states exclude each other in case of conventional @xmath1-pairing .",
    "this conclusion seems to be at odds with the well known fact that antiferromagnetism and superconductivity do coexist homogeneously in a number of materials where the evidence for conventional electron - phonon pairing is very strong , such as the borocarbides@xcite @xmath350 and the ternary superconductors@xcite @xmath351 and @xmath352 , with @xmath353 denoting a rare earth .",
    "the crucial difference between these rare earth based systems and the iron pnictide superconductors is that the magnetism in the former is due to localized rare earth spins while in the latter the same electrons that superconduct are responsible for the entire ordered moment .",
    "thus , for our argumentation in the pnictides to hold , it is essential that the same electrons that form the cooper pair condensate are responsible for the ordered moment .",
    "this is evident from our hamiltonian , eq.([full_hamiltonian ] ) , where the order parameters @xmath29 and @xmath110 are expectation values of electronic states of the same bands .",

    "the prefactor @xmath394 grows as @xmath395 for large @xmath359 .",
    "thus , it is easily possible that the quartic coefficient of the magnetic order parameter is significantly enhanced in case of localized spins .",
    "for example , the relative corrections are around @xmath396 for @xmath397 and @xmath398 . since the order parameter coupling and the quartic coefficients of the superconducting term are unchanged",
    ", it follows that the condition @xmath399 for coexisting order can now be fulfilled easier than in the case of purely itinerant systems .",
    "this offers a natural explanation for the observation of homogeneous coexistence of both phases in systems such as the @xmath350 and addresses the fact that coexistence observed in systems with localized spins is not in contradiction to our conclusions . for completeness , we also analyzed a model with additional magnetic interactions between localized spins that are not captured by the rkky mechanism , adding to @xmath356 of eq.([h_afm_local ] ) the term @xmath400 .",
    "this new term will change the value of @xmath11 , but not affect the expression eq.([um loc ] ) for @xmath38 .",
    "additional consequences for localized spins are that the coefficient @xmath401 of the temperature dependent quadratic coefficient @xmath402 is expected to be larger compared to the corresponding coefficient @xmath403 of the superconducting order parameter if we consider the multicritical point @xmath404 near particle - hole symmetry , since @xmath405 . with eq.[condition_suppression ] follows then that it becomes harder to achieve a suppression of the magnetization with @xmath62 below the superconducting transition .",
    "the observed suppression@xcite of @xmath110 in the coexistence region of @xmath9 and @xmath63 is therefore an indication that the same electrons are responsible for both states and that magnetism is itinerant in these materials . on the other hand",
    "the condition @xmath406 for suppression of @xmath3 in the magnetically ordered state can easily be fulfilled .",
    "thus , while sc in systems with localized spins is affected by magnetic long range order , the opposite does not seem to hold and afm is rather indifferent to sc .",
    "finally we comment on the relevance of this calculation for heavy fermion superconductors , such as @xmath407 and @xmath408 . in @xmath407",

    "in fact one expects that a system in the heavy electron state is better described by the theory employed here for the feas systems , yet the interactions @xmath102 and @xmath121 as well as the quasi - particles masses are heavily renormalized due to kondo lattice screening .",
    "thus , while a detailed theory for the competition of magnetism and superconductivity in heavy electron states is complex , we do expect a similar competition in the feas systems and these heavy fermion compounds .",
    "the very similar behavior of the sc and afm transition lines in the phase diagrams@xcite of @xmath9 and @xmath407 , as well as the suppression of the magnetization@xcite of @xmath408 below @xmath3 , certainly support this view .",
    "so far we have analyzed the competition between afm and sc with the consequent suppression of the superconducting state in the underdoped region of the phase diagram of the iron arsenides . in the overdoped region",
    "there is no magnetically ordered state , yet sc is also suppressed and eventually disappears .",
    "the fermi surface in this part of the phase diagram also changes significantly : for electron ( hole ) doped samples , it is characterized by increasingly large electron ( hole ) pockets and decreasingly small hole ( electron ) pockets@xcite , which eventually disappear at a certain doping level . in this section ,",
    "we investigate how the the disappearance of these pockets from the fermi surface affects the transition temperature of the pure sc state .",
    "we consider , once more , one hole pocket centered at the brillouin zone and one electron pocket displaced by @xmath16 from the zone center . for definiteness , we use the band dispersions ( [ band_dispersion ] ) with @xmath98 and vary the chemical potential @xmath96 . here , we consider the effects of electron doping only , such that @xmath409 ; the case of hole doping ( @xmath410 ) is analogous and the same conclusions hold . for simplicity",

    "however , it is already significantly reduced for values of the chemical potential much smaller than that one . in figure",
    "[ fig_tc_overdoped ] , we present the behavior of @xmath3 for two values of the effective zero - doping coupling constant , @xmath434 and @xmath435 .",

    "the same conclusions also hold for the case of an arbitrary cutoff @xmath439 : the special point of the phase diagram where the hole pocket is reduced to a fermi point marks the onset of a dramatic reduction of @xmath3 , no matter the initial value of the coupling constant @xmath440 .",
    "as we mentioned , @xmath3 actually only vanishes at @xmath441 .",
    "however , in this region where it is strongly suppressed , even an uniform coulomb interaction is able to completely destroy superconductivity .",
    "this is to be contrasted to the optimally doped region , where the @xmath0 state is robust against an uniform coulomb repulsion , as we discussed in the previous section .    to illustrate how the @xmath0 sc state is killed in the region of strong suppression , @xmath428 , consider @xmath416 and an uniform repulsion @xmath309 . for simplicity",

    "thefore , close to the point of the phase diagram where the hole pocket disappears , the space dimensionality matters much more than in the usual cooper problem .",
    "our results suggest that the main factor responsible for the complete suppression of the sc state in the overdoped region of the iron arsenides phase diagram is the evolution of the fermi surface with doping .",
    "this is corroborated by arpes measurements@xcite on @xmath9 , which show no superconductivity in the overdoped region after the fermi surface loses one of its pockets around @xmath456 .",
    "the fact that superconductivity requires the presence of the hole pocket and the observation that the superconducting gap on the hole and electron pockets are very similar , strongly support the view that the pairing interaction in the pnictides is due to interband coupling .",
    "we showed that the ability of superconductivity and antiferromagnetism to order simultaneously depends sensitively on the nature of the cooper pair wave function . in a two - band system with particle - hole symmetry ,",
    "the itinerant afm state and the unconventional @xmath0 sc state are exactly in a borderline regime between phase coexistence and phase separation .",
    "in contrast , the conventional @xmath1 state is deep in the regime of mutual phase exclusion .",
    "we further demonstrated that this result holds regardless of additional details of the band structure or the system s dimensionality .",
    "it does not change either when one considers the presence of intraband pairing interactions or the effects of coulomb repulsion .",
    "the robustness of this result , valid around the multicritical point @xmath13 , is related to the quasiparticle excitation spectrum of the system , which depends on the peculiar combination @xmath457 only .",
    "this is the root of the so@xmath2 symmetry of the free energy expansion , which has been shown to hold not only in the mean - field level , but also in the strong coupling limit , as a subgroup of an emergent so@xmath229 symmetry present in the hamiltonian@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the inclusion of fluctuations in our free energy expansion are known to not change the condition for having the borderline regime,@xcite @xmath74 .",
    "all these facts suggest that this simple result is a much more general property of this type of system .",
    "we also demonstrated that for our results to hold , it is crucial that the same electrons that form cooper pairs are responsible for the formation of the ordered moment .",
    "for instance , we showed that an afm state generated by localized moments has a tendency of being indifferent to sc , falling much easier in the regime of phase coexistence .",
    "when applying this result to the pnictides , one has to critically evaluate whether the assumptions that were made are too restrictive .",
    "we assumed a certain vicinity to particle - hole symmetry .",
    "it is evident that the real materials do not have perfectly nested bands@xcite .",
    "yet , there are clearly two sets of pockets whose centers are separated by the ordering vector @xmath16 . as we showed , small perturbations in the ellipticity of one pocket or in the chemical potential bring the @xmath0 state to the regime of mutual exclusion . however , simultaneous perturbations in both quantities can bring the system to either regime , as our figure [ fig_gpp_gpm ] illustrates .",
    "most importantly , small deviations from perfect nesting are not sufficient to lead to simultaneous order of magnetism and @xmath1-pairing close to the multicritical point .",
    "the fact that particular details of the band structure are able to bring the @xmath0 state either to the phase coexistence or to the phase separation regime is , in our view , what makes some of the iron arsenides display second - order afm - sc transition and others , first - order afm - sc transition . for @xmath9 , we were able to independently `` fit '' the effective band structure parameters to give the correct doping and @xmath11 dependence of the zero - temperature magnetization in the absence of superconductivity@xcite .",
    "having this set of parameters , which did not depend on any sc property , we were able to obtain the complete mean - field @xmath458 phase diagram and to readily calculate the parameter @xmath57 , verifying that , as evidenced by many experimental probes,@xcite @xmath9 has homogeneous coexistence between sc and afm states .    for other compounds that are believed to display phase separation , like @xmath5 and @xmath8",
    ", we do not have the same systematic diffraction measurements that allow a reliable extraction of effective two - band parameters .",
    "even though tight - binding fits to dft - calculated band structures are available , they usually refer to the parent compounds .",
    "the problem to extrapolate them to finite doping is that , in these materials , doping is not on the fe site nor on the feas plane , which makes it much more difficult to make a direct association between electronic occupation number and doping level , as we did for @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , in some of the pnictides , the issue of whether they have homogeneous or heterogeneous afm - sc coexistence is still not completely settled .",
    "for example , in @xmath8 , while many experiments find phase separation , mssbauer spectroscopy identifies microscopic coexistence@xcite . in @xmath459 muon spin",
    "rotation@xcite finds homogeneous coexistence while a work combining powder x - ray diffraction , mssbauer spectroscopy and nuclear resonant forward scattering finds phase separation@xcite .    in what concerns the pairing state , although many theories for pairing due to electronic interactions predict a nodeless @xmath0 state , other models also suggest that accidental ( i.e. not related to symmetry ) nodes@xcite or even d - wave nodal states@xcite could be present .",
    "furthermore , penetration depth experiments are in principle consistent with the existence of accidental nodes @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of gap nodes in our model , as we discussed , tend to move the sc state from the borderline regime to the mutual exclusion regime , although not as deep as in the @xmath1 case .",
    "clearly , @xmath156 sign - changing gap functions with specific configurations of nodes could be as effective as small perturbations of the particle - hole symmetric band structure in making the afm - sc state go from one regime to the other .",
    "thus , while we can not discard the presence of unconventional nodal states coexisting with afm , we can certainly discard the conventional @xmath1 state : it is simply incompatible with magnetism .",
    "regarding the nature of the magnetic state , there is still some debate whether the afm phase is due to conduction electrons or localized spins .",
    "our analysis shed light on this subject : as our calculations demonstrated , a magnetically ordered phase with localized spins can coexist much easier with superconductivity .",
    "this holds even for conventional bcs states , like in the case of the ternary@xcite and quaternary@xcite rare earth compounds .",
    "furthermore , the magnetization is not so affected by the sc condensate as in the case of purely itinerant magnetism .",
    "therefore , the experimental observation of reentrance of the paramagnetic phase inside the sc dome@xcite seems to rule out the afm state formed only by localized moments .",
    "as we showed , in the underdoped side of the feas phase diagram , both @xmath11 and @xmath3 are suppressed due to the competition between the afm and sc phases .",
    "the nel transition line is even bent back , approaching the @xmath42 axis vertically , similar to the case of a first - order transition line .",
    "the suppression of @xmath3 is milder ; this difference is probably due to the fact that the afm gap opens only around the corresponding bragg scattered points,@xcite whereas the sc gap opens isotropically around the fermi surface . in the overdoped side , however , sc is the only thermodynamic ordered phase of the system and yet it is suppressed similarly to the underdoped side .",
    "our calculations using the coupled sc gap equations shows that this suppression is related to the disappearance of one of the pockets from the fermi surface .",
    "as suggested by our figures [ fig_tc_overdoped ] and [ fig_overdoped_3d ] , and by arpes measurements@xcite in @xmath9 , the main cause of suppression of sc in the overdoped side seems to be the doping - induced changes in the fermi surface rather than possible changes in the magnitude of the pairing interaction .",
    "interestingly , the fermi surface is also indirectly responsible for the suppression of @xmath3 in the underdoped side , since it is the driving force of the afm instability@xcite .",
    "the calculations we presented here did not take into account another important degree of freedom present in the iron arsenides , the orthorhombic distortion .",
    "however , in separate works , we showed that the competition between sc and afm , combined with the coupling between nematic degrees of freedom and structural distortion , are able to consistently explain the observed back - bending of the structural transition line@xcite inside the sc dome as well as the increase of the shear modulus@xcite below @xmath3 .",
    "finally , we comment that in many models of unconventional pairing in the iron arsenides , the bosons responsible for the formation of cooper pairs are spin fluctuations@xcite . in this case , the pairing interaction @xmath121 itself would also be sensitive to the presence of magnetic long range order . clearly , this would change some details of the coexistence state , particularly the form of the transition lines . yet , our main conclusions still hold in this case , since the decision about the coexistence between afm and sc is made when both transition temperatures are close , implying that the order parameters are only infinitesimal .",

    "here , we rederive the ginzburg - landau expansion in eq . ( [ f ] ) by explicitly integrating out the fermionic degrees of freedom of a system with competing sc and afm .",
    "this method is useful since it provides a diagrammatic interpretation for the coefficients , as presented in figure [ fig_feynman ] .",
    "we first define the nambu operator :      and generalize the uniform order parameters @xmath119 and @xmath110 to inhomogeneous functions of space and time @xmath461 and @xmath462 , where @xmath463 is a fermionic matsubara frequency .",
    "thus , denoting @xmath464 , we obtain the green s function :                          where @xmath473 and @xmath474 , with @xmath475 denoting the volume of the system .",
    "the fermions can now be integrated out , yielding an effective action in terms of the collective afm and sc fields @xmath476 .",
    "the partition function of the free fermions is given by :                  with excitation energies @xmath127 given by the positive roots of ( [ excitation_energies ] ) .",
    "minimization of the free energy ( [ free_energy ] ) with respect to @xmath119 and @xmath110 leads then to the gap equations ( [ gap_equations ] ) .",
    "going back to the effective action ( [ effective_action ] ) , we can now perform a ginzburg - landau expansion in the afm and sc order parameters .",
    "expansion of the logarithm yields , for the free energy relative to the paramagnetic , normal phase :          in the previous expressions , we introduced the non - interacting single - particle green s functions @xmath485 and @xmath486 .",
    "thus , the coefficients depend only on the band structure and on the magnitude of the electronic interactions .",
    "the feynman diagrams associated to the quartic coefficients of ( [ formal_coefficients ] ) are presented in figure [ fig_feynman ] .",
    "evaluation of the matsubara sums then leads to ( [ gl_coefficients_1 ] ) , ( [ gl_coefficients_2 ] ) and ( [ gl_coefficients_3 ] ) for the ginzburg - landau coefficients .",

    "<S> in contrast , conventional @xmath1 pairing is not able to coexist with magnetism . expanding the microscopic free energy of the system with competing orders around the multicritical point </S>",
    "<S> , we find that static magnetism plays the role of an intrinsic interband josephson coupling , making the phase diagram sensitive to the symmetry of the cooper pair wavefunction . </S>",
    "<S> we relate this result to the quasiparticle excitation spectrum and to the emergent so@xmath2 symmetry of systems with particle - hole symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> our results rely on the assumption that the same electrons that form the ordered moment contribute to the superconducting condensate and that the system is close to particle - hole symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare the suppression of sc in different regions of the feas phase diagram , showing that while in the underdoped side it is due to the competition with afm , in the overdoped side it is related to the disappearance of pockets from the fermi surface . </S>"
