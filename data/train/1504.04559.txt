    "in contrast to @xmath0-process elements , the observed scatters in [ @xmath16/fe ] is known to be as small as the measurement errors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this result is consistent with such small scatters in [ mg / fe ] , because each evolutionary trend is almost independent of @xmath23 .",
    "the resulting evolution of eu ( representative of @xmath0-process elements ) is presented in figure  [ fig : case1]e and compared to observed stellar values .",
    "we notice a transition from slow to rapid evolution of [ eu / fe ] for each sub - halo at @xmath42100 myr , as a result of the contribution from long - lived binaries starting .",
    "the corresponding [ fe / h ] ( see figure  [ fig : case1]b ) differs from one sub - halo to another , being lower than [ fe / h ] @xmath1 for @xmath85 .",
    "this indicates that the presence of stars at [ fe / h ] @xmath1 with star - to - star scatter in [ eu / fe ] ( @xmath86 ) can be interpreted as a result of nsm activity in sub - halos with various @xmath36 .",
    "our model can not , however , explain the presence of @xmath0-process - enhanced stars with [ eu / fe ] @xmath87 .",
    "in addition our result predicts the presence of stars having [ eu / fe ] @xmath88 for [ fe / h ] @xmath89 .",
    "this is due to the contribution of the short - lived nsm at early times ( @xmath90  myr ) .",
    "measurements of eu in such stars would be challenging because of the weak spectral lines .",
    "such a signature has been seen in the ba abundances of emp stars , [ ba / fe ] @xmath91  @xmath92 at [ fe / h ] @xmath93 ( figure  [ fig : case1]f ) , which could also be explained as due to the contribution of short - lived binaries .",
    "note that the [ ba / fe ] values for [ fe / h]@xmath15 are underpredicted compared to the observed ones ; in this metallicity , contribution from the @xmath94-process becomes important @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : case2 ] shows the results for case  2 , where a constant @xmath36 is assumed .",
    "we find the cumulative numbers of nsms and ccsne being similar to those in case  1 ( figure  [ fig : case1]a ) .",
    "however , the evolutions stop earlier for less massive sub - halos .",
    "this is due to the termination of star formation because of gas removal by their significant outflows with greater values of @xmath39 .",
    "in contrast to case  1 , the [ fe / h ] evolution ( figure  [ fig : case2]b ) is identical among sub - halos because of the same @xmath36 , although the termination points differ depending on their @xmath39 . the resulting mds ( figure  [ fig : case2]c ) as well as the evolutions of mg ( figure  [ fig : case2]d ) are similar between cases  1 and 2 . in figure",
    "[ fig : case2]e , we find that the @xmath0-process abundances increase to values greater than [ eu / fe ] @xmath7 for the sub - halos with @xmath95 .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the higher @xmath39 lead to smaller fe amounts and thus higher eu / fe ratios .",
    "it is interesting to note that , even without invoking inhomogeneity of ism , the enhancement of eu can be in part explained by our sub - halo models .",
    "however , our result here can not account for the @xmath0-process enrichment at [ fe / h ] @xmath96 because the [ eu / fe ] s start rising at [ fe / h ] @xmath97 for all the sub - halos .",
    "our results imply that the reality may be between these two extremes , cases  1 and 2 ; reasonable combinations of @xmath36 and @xmath39 might account for the presence of @xmath0-process - enhanced stars at [ fe / h ] @xmath1 .",
    "it is also important to note that the cumulative numbers for the least massive sub - halos ( @xmath98 ) are @xmath99 around the end of their evolutions .",
    "this could be another source of large enhancements of [ eu / fe ] ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "the [ eu / fe ] values would be substantially higher than the _ averaged _ curves of our models , provided that only a fraction of sub - halos experienced nsms .",
    "we studied the role of nsms for the chemical evolution of @xmath0-process elements in the framework of the galactic halo formation from merging sub - halos .",
    "it is found that the appearance of eu at [ fe / h ] @xmath1 with star - to - star scatter in [ eu / fe ] ( @xmath86 ) at [ fe / h ] @xmath101 can be interpreted as a result of lower star formation efficiency @xmath36 for less massive sub - halos . on the other hand ,",
    "the presence of highly @xmath0-process - enhanced emp stars ( [ eu / fe ] @xmath102 ) can be explained if values of @xmath39 ( the multiplicative factor for the outflow rate ) are higher for less massive sub - halos .",
    "these may be reasonable assumptions because less massive sub - halo systems have weaker gravitational potential ( as indicated by @xmath80 in table  3 ) and thus are expected to form stars less efficiently and/or expel the ism more easily .",
    "the ratio of ofr to sfr , @xmath40 , is assumed to be proportional to @xmath103 .",
    "recent observations of relatively massive galaxies ( @xmath104 ) also suggest similar anti - correlation between @xmath23 and @xmath40 @xcite . under this assumption",
    ", the metallicity at the peak of each sub - halo s md ( table  3 ) appears to be consistent with the observed mass - metallicity relation . in addition",
    ", the total md weighted with the sub - halo mass function shows reasonable agreement with the observed one of the galactic halo .",
    "the low - level ba abundances ( [ ba / fe ] @xmath105 ) observed in the emp stars of [ fe / h ] @xmath89 may be due to the contribution from the short - lived binaries ( with @xmath52  myr in this study ) .",
    "thus , the main features of @xmath0-process abundances observed in emp stars , their appearance at [ fe / h ] @xmath1 with large star - to - star scatter and their sub - solar amounts for [ fe / h ] @xmath89 , can be potentially explained by the contribution from solely nsms .",
    "the highly eu enhanced stars at [ fe / h]@xmath1 may be accounted by reasonable combinations of @xmath36 and @xmath39 .",
    "the small cumulative numbers of nsms ( @xmath106 ) for least - massive sub - halos could be additional reason for the observed large scatter in [ eu / fe ] , because nsms may occur only in some of them , while no nsms occur in others .",
    "once nsms occur in such less massive systems , their ism must be highly enriched by @xmath0-process elements .    in conclusion ,",
    "our results imply that the current observational evidences of @xmath0-process signatures in emp stars can be interpreted as a consequence of the galactic halo formation from merging sub - halos",
    ". if the model is a reasonable simplification for such chemo - dynamical evolutions of sub - halos , nsms can be the main @xmath0-process contributors throughout the galactic history .",
    "contributions from ccsne are not necessarily needed as invoked in previous gce studies .",
    "note that our assumption of well - mixed ism might not necessarily be an oversimplification , at least for less - massive sub - halos , in which a small number of explosive events would easily homogenize their smaller amount of ism before the next episode of star formation .",
    "the observed small scatters of abundance ratios of other elements such as iron - peak elements or @xmath16-elements in emp stars should be examined using a consistent assumption .",
    "possible effects of ism inhomogeneity as well as of stochastic nature of nsm events ( i.e. , @xmath107 ) will be discussed in a forthcoming paper .",
