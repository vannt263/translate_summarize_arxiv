    "the nature of the dark matter is one of the mysteries in today s physical science .",
    "it has been intensively explored both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "studies showed that the cosmic dark matter is plausibly composed of non - baryonic weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) @xcite . while the standard model of particle physics can not provide a candidate for the dark matter wimp , the popular supersymmetric theory with r - parity conservation can provide a good candidate , i.e. , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) .",
    "so far the widely studied scenario is that the lightest neutralino is assumed to be the lsp .",
    "however , despite of the overwhelming popularity of this scenario , other possibilities should not be ignored due to the following reasons . on the one hand ,",
    "the success of such neutralino dark matter scenario may be spoiled by the problems caused by gravitino in the reheating era @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the neutralino dark matter scenario has not yet been confirmed by current experiments@xcite .",
    "one possible scenario other than neutralino lsp is that the gravitino is assumed to be the lsp .",
    "such gravitino lsps can form warm or cold cosmic dark matter , depending on the gravitino mass :    * in some low - energy susy breaking models , like the gauge mediated susy breaking ( gmsb ) models , the gravitino can be as light as kev , much lighter than other supersymmetric particles .",
    "it can thus form the warm dark matter .",
    "note that the recent wmap data imposed severe constraints on the dark matter type . as analyzed in @xcite ,",
    "while a very tiny component of dark matter can be the hot neutrinos , the warm dark matter is ruled out due to the detected early re - ionization of the universe at a redshift @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the scenario of warm dark matter gravitino is not favored by recent observation . * in the popular msugra models , the gravitino mass is unspecified and only known to be of the weak - scale .",
    "such heavy gravitino is possibly the lsp and can form the cold dark matter in the universe .",
    "in contrast to the highly constrained scenarios , in which the gravitino is produced as a thermal relic @xcite or produced during reheating @xcite , a new scenario , assuming the gravitino to be produced from the late decays of the thermal relic wimps , was recently proposed in @xcite .    in this article",
    "we focus our attention on this new gravitino dark matter scenario .",
    "since the heavy gravitinos couple gravitionally , they are naturally the so - called superweakly interacting massive particles ( superwimps ) . as a plausible candidate for the cold dark matter in the universe",
    "@xcite , the gravitino superwimp can naturally evade the current dark matter detection experiments due to its superweak couplings .",
    "however , this scenario must be subjected to the constraints from the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) as well as the wmap data @xcite :    * the late decays of wimps ( like neutralinos ) into gravitino superwimps will release electromagnetic ( em ) and hadronic energy .",
    "such energy release will alter the bbn predictions for light element abundances @xcite .",
    "requiring the resulted predictions for light element abundances to agree with the measured values will impose strong constraints on the gravitino dark matter scenario .",
    "* wmap precisely measured many quantities , especially the total matter density and the baryon density , @xmath4 from such results we can deduce the 2@xmath5 range for the cold dark matter density @xmath6 which is dramatically more accurate than previous results and agrees quite well with other approaches .",
    "such precise measurements will impose strong constraints on the parameter space of gravitino dark matter scenario .",
    "the aim of this article is to examine these constraints on the parameter space of msugra in this new gravitino dark matter scenario . assuming the popular case that the lightest neutralino is the nlsp",
    ", we will examine the constraints on the msugra parameter space from the bbn light element abundances , the wmap data of relic density as well as the @xmath0 branching ratio data .",
    "in the new scenario @xcite , the nlsps freeze out with a thermal relic density @xmath7 and then decay to the gravitino at time @xmath8 .",
    "thus the relic density of gravitino dark matter is obtained by @xmath9 the late decays of the nlsps will release energy which will alter the light element abundances .",
    "in fact , the later injection of high energy photon with the stopping energy inversely proportional to the temperature by scattering off the background photon will dissociate the existing light elements .",
    "if carefully chosen , such injecting em energy can destruct the light element abundances to proper values .",
    "it is well known that the bbn predictions for light element abundances are quite successful for most light elements . yet",
    "the bbn predictions for @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( especially @xmath11 ) seemingly do not agree with the wmap data @xcite .",
    "requiring such discrepancy be settled by the energy released from the late - decaying nlsps and , at the same time , requiring such energy release not to spoil the successful bbn predictions for other light elements , the constraints on the nlsp lifetime ( in seconds ) and em energy release can be obtained @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the emitted em energy density , with @xmath14 being the initial em energy release from the decay , @xmath15 being the branching fraction of the decay into em components , and @xmath16 being the nlsp number density normalized to the bg photon number density . in the derivation of the above bounds , the ratio @xmath17 is fixed to be @xmath18 , and the bounds on the primordial abundances of light elements are taken to be @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes @xmath21he abundance .",
    "the dominant decay of neutralino ( @xmath22 ) nlsp into gravitino ( @xmath23 ) lsp is through @xmath24 with a rate given by @xmath25 ^ 3     \\left[1 + 3\\frac{m_{\\tilde g } ^2}{m_{\\tilde\\chi}^2}\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the gravitino lsp mass , @xmath27 is the neutralino nlsp mass , @xmath28 gev is the reduced plank scale , @xmath29 is the weak mixing angle , and @xmath30 denotes the matrix element projecting the @xmath31-th neutralino into bino ( @xmath32 ) , wino ( @xmath33 ) and higgsinos ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "for such a decay we have @xmath35 we would like to make some clarifications about our numerical calculations :    * in the calculation of the thermal relic density of the nlsps , we considered the general mixing of neutralinos and used the package microomega @xcite , which includes all tree level contributions to the scattering amplitudes . * in the scan over the msugra parameter space , we used suspect2.0 @xcite to obtain the sparticle masses in msugra models , which includes one - loop corrections to sparticle masses and two - loop corrections to higgs masses . *",
    "when deriving the constraints on the msugra parameter space , we consider the bbn constraints in eqs.([range1],[range2 ] ) , the wmap data of relic dark matter density in eq.([density ] ) as well as the @xmath0 bound @xcite : @xmath36 furthermore , we fixed the common trilinear coupling @xmath37 since our results are not sensitive to it . * in our calculation",
    "we also considered the muon anomalous magnetic moment @xmath38 .",
    "since so far much theoretical uncertainty exists in @xmath38 predictions or @xmath39 , depending on the calculation approaches .",
    "another group @xcite gives @xmath40 by using @xmath41 decay data to determine vacuum polarization .",
    "] , we did not use @xmath38 to set constraints and , instead , we only gave the range of the msugra contributions corresponding to each case .",
    "this will be useful when @xmath38 uncertainty is further reduced in the future .",
    "the bounds on the masses of the neutralino nlsp and gravitino lsp are shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "one sees that bbn results give rather stringent upper and lower bounds @xmath42 we found that the neutralino nlsp is quite bino - like ( @xmath43 ) in the allowed regions in fig.[fig1 ]    the allowed regions in the plane of @xmath44 versus @xmath45 are shown in fig.[fig2 ] for plus sign of @xmath46 and fig.[fig3 ] for minus sign of @xmath46 . from fig.[fig2 ] we see that for plus sign of @xmath46 much of the parameter space with @xmath47 is ruled out .",
    "for example , for @xmath48 , only a narrow strip survives , i.e. , 225 gev @xmath49 300 gev and 1020 gev @xmath50 1270 gev ( the corresponding contribution to @xmath38 is @xmath51 ) .",
    "when @xmath1 increase to @xmath52 , the allowed region gets quite large , i.e. , 740 gev @xmath53 1730 gev and 1060 gev @xmath50 1720 gev ( the corresponding contribution to @xmath38 is @xmath54 ) .    for minus sign of @xmath46 ,",
    "similar results are obtained .",
    "we see from fig.[fig3 ] that for @xmath55 , the constraints are quite stringent . for example , for @xmath48",
    "the constraints are 220 gev @xmath53 305 gev and 1020 gev @xmath50 1280 gev ( the corresponding contribution to @xmath38 is @xmath56 ) .",
    "when @xmath1 increases to @xmath57 , the constraints are weakened to 1060 gev @xmath53 1530 gev , 1290 gev @xmath50 1795 gev ( the corresponding contribution to @xmath38 is @xmath58 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that if @xmath59 is required to be positive ( negative ) , then the allowed regions in @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) case will be completely ruled out .",
    "therefore , a further scrutiny of @xmath38 will provide meaningful constraints on the parameter space of msugra .",
    "it should be pointed out that the above stringent constraints in figs .",
    "2 and 3 were obtained under the requirement that the gravitinos from the late decays of the nlsp make up all the dark matter .",
    "if other particles like axions are also a component of dark matter , then the constraints will be changed .",
    "moreover , if the relic gravitino dark matter are partly produced during reheating , the constraints will also be changed . in order to forbid gravitino ( with mass range in eq.(16 ) ) production during reheating , the reheating temperature @xmath62 must be lower than a certain value . following the analyses in @xcite",
    ", we evaluated such a limit and found @xmath63 gev .    note that in our analysis we only considered the consequence of em energy release from the late decays of wimps and required such em energy release to settle the discrepancy between the bbn predictions and the observed values for light element abundances .",
    "however , as can be seen in the allowed @xmath64 region of fig .",
    "1 , the decay @xmath65 is also possible and thus will cause hadronic energy release from the subsequent @xmath66 decays .",
    "such hadronic energy release can be quite dangerous since it can alter the bbn predictions for the light element abundances .",
    "in ref.@xcite the authors studied the bounds from the hadronic energy release and found that such hadronic bounds may be stringent , which are more aggressive than the bounds of eq.([dh ] ) used by us to obtain the best fit region . ] due to the overproduction of @xmath67 .",
    "however , as pointed out in ref.@xcite , for the best fit region with lifetime @xmath41 between @xmath68 and @xmath69 , the @xmath67 overproduction from hadronic energy is possibly canceled by the overdestruction from em energy and thus the hadronic bounds become less stringent and subject to large uncertainty .",
    "in such a region the em energy effects are dominant @xcite .",
    "since in our study we focused on the best fit region , we did not consider the hadronic effects .",
    "we examined the constraints on the newly proposed dark matter scenario , in which the gravitino is assumed to be the lsp and produced from the late decays of metastable nlsp .",
    "although such gravitino dark matter can naturally evade the current detection experiments due to its superweak couplings , we found , however , that this scenario is subjected to stringent constraints from the bbn predictions for light element abundances as well as the wmap data for the relic density . assuming the popular case that the lightest neutralino is the nlsp in msugra models",
    ", we found that the low @xmath1 ( @xmath2 40 ) region as well as the region accessible at the lhc are severely constrained .",
    "the popular msugra models will be explored in future colliders like the lhc . for this purpose",
    ", it is important to know which part of the parameter space is viable and thus should be primarily explored . in this regard , the stringent cosmological constraints on the msugra parameter space obtained in this work will be useful . especially ,",
    "if the ongoing and planned dark matter detection experiments fail to find any dark matter signal , it will imply that the dark matter interactions are too weak and thus the gravitino dark matter scenario will be favored .",
    "then , to test this scenario at colliders , the stringent cosmological constraints on the parameter space will be quite instructive .",
    "this would serve as a good example that the studies in cosmology and astrophysics can shed some light on particle collider physics .",
    "on the other hand , the lhc could explore msugra parameter space up to @xmath70 gev ( 700 gev ) for small ( large ) values of @xmath44 , assuming 100 @xmath71 of integrated luminosity @xcite . if the lhc results finally restrain the parameter space to one of the regions obtained in this work",
    ", then it implies that the gravitino dark matter scenario is favored . in this sence",
    ", the studies in particle physics can provide some insights in the understanding of dark matter in cosmology .",
    "we address that our study in this work is just illustrative instead of exhaustive .",
    "we assumed the popular case that the lightest neutralino is the nlsp in msugra models .",
    "actually , other super particles , like tau - slepton , are also likely to be the nlsp in msugra models . if tau - slepton is assumed to be the nlsp , there are some theoretical uncertainties in its decay modes and the corresponding energy release .",
    "note added : while we are preparing this manuscript , some other preprints @xcite appeared , where the constraints on the gravitino dark matter scenario are studied .",
    "we found that the studies in @xcite are quite exhaustively , where the scenarios of neutralino nlsp , stau nlsp as well as sneutrino nlsp are all considered . compared with the studies in @xcite ,",
    "the characteristic of our study is that we performed a scan over the msugra parameter space and presented the allowed regions in terms of original msugra parameters .",
    "in addition , the bbn constraints on the em energy release are more stringent in our study since we required such energy release settle the discrepancy between the bbn prediction and the wmap data for @xmath11 abundance .",
