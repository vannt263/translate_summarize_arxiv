    "the interaction of fermions with an external magnetic field is expected to be associated with phenomena like metal - to - insulating phase transitions in semiconductors  @xcite , the quantum hall effect  @xcite and transport properties in superconductors  @xcite , just to mention a few examples in the context of condensed matter physics . among these systems , planar ones are of particular interest and they include , for example , high - temperature superconductors , organic thin films and most recently , the physics of graphene  @xcite .",
    "most of these systems have an excitation spectrum that can be well described by relativistic dirac - like fermions .",
    "a typical example is the physics of graphene , in which electron transport is essentially governed by the dirac s relativistic equation .",
    "it is then expected that these types of planar systems can be appropriately described by quantum field theory models in two spatial dimensions . in this context , the gross - neveu ( gn ) type of models  @xcite in @xmath0 dimensions are very popular not only because of their simplicity , but also for their ability to capture many of the relevant physics exhibited by planar fermionic systems in general .",
    "these models can have either a discrete , @xmath1 , or a continuous , @xmath2 , chiral symmetry .",
    "they consist of @xmath3 massless four - component fermions self - interacting through a local four - fermi interaction .",
    "one of the most basic motivations for studying the properties of fermionic planar systems is to determine whether we can have a metal - to - insulating type of transition under the variation of external parameters , like temperature , chemical potential and external fields , e.g. , an external magnetic field .",
    "the metal - insulator transition is directly connected to the presence of a nonvanishing gap in the excitation spectrum for the fermions and how this gap eventually vanishes in the presence of external conditions . in the quantum field theory context , a mass term for the fermions can be generated dynamically in the absence of external conditions , like in the original gn model , and it is associated with the breaking of the chiral symmetry in the model .    in this work",
    "we make use of the original gn model with discrete chiral symmetry and study the chiral phase transition when the system is in the presence of an external tilted magnetic field , i.e. , a magnetic field that includes both parallel and perpendicular components that are being applied simultaneously to the system ( see fig .",
    "[ bbfig1 ] ) .",
    "this model has been previously extensively analyzed when in the presence of a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the plane ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite for some of the earlier studies ) and , more recently , in the presence of an in - plane magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "but , surprisingly , a study of both types of fields , parallel and perpendicular to the system s plane , applied simultaneously is still lacking .",
    "perhaps the reason for this negligence in the literature was because not much was expected for the effects on the system symmetry due to a parallel component of the field .",
    "however , there are good reasons for making this study .",
    "it is well known that a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath4 leads to an _ enhancement _ of the chiral - symmetry - broken region ( thus , it tends to increase a gap in the excitation spectrum ) .",
    "this is the magnetic catalysis phenomenon that can occur for all values of the four - fermi interaction strength  @xcite .",
    "however , an in - plane magnetic field @xmath5 has been shown to produce an opposite effect  @xcite , leading to a _ reduction _ of the chiral symmetry broken region .",
    "in other words , a parallel component of the magnetic field tends to act on restoring the chiral symmetry for large enough values of @xmath5 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the in - plane magnetic field contributes to enhance the zeeman energy term ( which depends on the total magnetic field applied to the system ) , which in turn leads to larger effective polarization of the system .",
    "the polarized planar fermionic system tends to exhibit less chiral symmetry .",
    "since the application of perpendicular and parallel ( in - plane ) magnetic fields leads to opposite effects on the chiral symmetry , it is reasonable to expect the combination of both components , when applied simultaneously to the system , to possibly lead to new patterns for the chiral phase transition .",
    "we will show in this work that this indeed can happen under an appropriate choice of parameters . in this paper",
    "we show that the application of both @xmath4 and @xmath5 , with the combined effects of temperature @xmath6 and chemical potential @xmath7 , can lead to a phase diagram that can display a rich structure , with the possibility of exhibiting multiple critical points and reentrant phases .",
    "we show that this is a consequence of the competing effects on the system s chiral symmetry coming from each component of the applied oblique external magnetic field .",

    "[ fig2b](b ) , we have purposively considered a value of asymmetry of @xmath140 . recall that for an asymmetry above the critical value of @xmath135 and @xmath106 , the chiral symmetry would always be restored  @xcite .",
    "however , as we start increasing @xmath4 , a symmetry - broken region starts to emerge after some large enough value for the perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "this region of chiral - symmetry - broken phase that appears also has the form of the multicritical curves shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2b](a ) . for a sufficiently large value of @xmath4 , which for the parameters used in the plot of fig .",
    "[ fig2b](b ) is @xmath141 , one of the additional tricritical points ( and its associated first - order transition line ) disappears and the phase diagram shows again a standard form with a second - order critical line , a first - order transition line and a tricritical point in between them , a structure just like the ones shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - separateb](b ) .",
    "the combined effect of both the zeeman energy term , generating the asymmetry , and the perpendicular component of the magnetic field , producing the landau energy levels and associated magnetic catalysis , is able to lead to reentrant phase transitions , as seen from the results in fig .",
    "[ fig2b ] , whenever more than one tricritical point is present",
    ". this feature will be even more apparent when we consider the zero - temperature limit and look at the possibility of quantum phase transitions at fixed values of @xmath4 and @xmath54 and varying chemical potential , a situation we will analyze in more detail below , in sec .",

    "[ fig - meta ] we present the detailed structure for some of the phase diagrams shown in fig .  [ fig2b ] , including now the metastable lines .",
    "the metastable lines give the points for which a local minimum of the effective potential first appears or disappears .",
    "these lines are the ones shown on the left and on the right of the first - order critical lines .",
    "again , from the results shown in figs .  [ fig - meta](c ) and [ fig - meta](d ) , we can see the presence of reentrant phase transitions at some fixed temperature and varying chemical potential ( e.g. , the analogue of varying the doping in condensed matter systems ) .",

    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ muxdeltamu ] . note from fig .",
    "[ muxdeltamu ] that for fixed values for the asymmetry @xmath54 , we can find multiple reentrant phases .",
    "examples of how these reentrant phases manifest from the effective potential are shown in fig .",
    "[ figveff ] for two specific values of asymmetry , @xmath147 and @xmath148 .    from the forms of the effective potential shown in fig .",
    "[ figveff ] , we see that two forms of ( first - order ) reentrant phase transitions are possible at some value for the asymmetry and when the chemical potential is increased .",
    "we can have a reentrant phase transition starting at a chiral broken state , @xmath149 , going to one or more intermediate chiral broken states with @xmath150 , @xmath151 , and then to a chiral symmetric state , @xmath129 .",
    "this is the case shown , e.g. , in the first panel in fig .",
    "[ figveff ] .",
    "the other possibility is , starting from a chiral symmetric state , @xmath129 , going to one or more intermediate chiral broken states , with @xmath152 , and then back to the chiral symmetric state .",
    "this is , e.g. , represented in the second panel in fig .",
    "[ figveff ] .",
    "it is interestingly to notice from fig .",
    "[ muxdeltamu ] that the reentrant phases are maximal ( occur more frequently ) when @xmath153 .",
    "this corresponds to the full polarization regime , @xmath154 and @xmath155 . in fig .",
    "[ sigmamudeltamu ] we show the values assumed for the vacuum expectation value @xmath82 along this full polarization regime . by increasing the chemical potential , the value of @xmath82 can decrease discontinuously through many intermediate first - order phase transitions .",
    "this type of pattern is found to be exclusive of the full polarization regime .",
    "though this pattern of multiple phase transitions can happen at any nonzero value of @xmath4 in principle , this structure is not stable when thermal fluctuations are accounted for . upon leaving the quantum regime @xmath92 and by increasing the temperature , the intermediate transitions going from a value of @xmath156 to a value @xmath157 ( where @xmath158 ) quickly disappear .",
    "this can be easily understood from the results shown for the effective potential in fig .",
    "[ figveff ] .",
    "these intermediate first - order transitions are in general characterized by a small potential barrier . by increasing the temperature ,",
    "these intermediate minima in the potential are quickly smoothed out .",
    "the smaller @xmath4 is , the smaller the temperature needed to smooth out the intermediate transitions will be .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ sigmatmudeltamu ] , we have the case of @xmath159 and for a temperature of @xmath160 , which are taken as representative values .",
    "all intermediate transitions are smoothed out and @xmath82 becomes mostly a continuously varying function , with only the strongest first - order transition remaining , which the first one shown in fig .",
    "[ sigmamudeltamu ] , which also remains in fig .",
    "[ sigmatmudeltamu ] . by further increasing the temperature ,",
    "the transition becomes just a second - order one , with @xmath82 continuously varying before vanishing completely at a given critical value of chemical potential .",
    "this corresponds to crossing one of the lines of second - order phase transition .    from the expression for the effective potential in the @xmath92 limit , eq .",
    "( [ veffa ] ) , we can find approximate analytical expressions for the vacuum expectation value @xmath82 in the large magnetic field regime , with @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "for instance , in the @xmath163 case , we find , valid for either positive or negative values of @xmath80 ,    @xmath164    where @xmath165 , while for the case when there is only the perpendicular component of the magnetic field , with @xmath55 and setting @xmath131 , we find    @xmath166    where    @xmath167    these results can be compared with the one in the fully polarized case , @xmath168 . taking @xmath161 and @xmath169 ,",

    "( [ sigmat0mu0deltamu0 ] ) .",
    "it is not only convenient but also useful to look at possible physical quantities that can be measured in the laboratory and give confirmation of the existence of the reentrant and multiple phase transitions we have found above . in most realistic experiments ,",
    "the measured quantities of interest are related , for example , to susceptibilities , like the magnetic susceptibility and also quantities related to electric transport . in the presence of a tilted magnetic field , we can have each field contributing differently to these quantities .",
    "for example , it is expected that the enhancement of the zeeman splitting caused by the in - plane component of the magnetic field will have important effects in the experiments with graphene and also with other planar systems .",
    "based on experimental studies of an in - plane magnetic field in graphene , the zeeman splitting has been shown to be important in both the spin transport and conductance fluctuation properties  @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that the zeeman splitting leads to the spectrum of the effective single - particle hamiltonian exactly as required by the observed pattern of quantization of hall conductivity  @xcite .",
    "since the hall conductivity is a typical quantity of importance for analysis when studying these systems , we will here concentrate on the possible effects the reentrant and multiple phase transitions we have found can have on it .",

    "we will investigate this in detail elsewhere .",
    "as far the chiral symmetry is concerned , the parallel component of the magnetic field leads to a zeeman effect in these planar systems that tends to weaken the chiral symmetry .",
    "thus , the chiral symmetry phase transition , which in condensed matter systems can be associated with an insulating - to - metal type of transition , may happen at a smaller critical temperature in the presence of a zeeman field .",
    "this behavior , due to an increasing magnetic zeeman field , is exactly the opposite of that observed when a perpendicular magnetic field is applied to the system ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in a perpendicular magnetic field the chiral symmetry breaking becomes stronger as a consequence of the effect of the magnetic field , a behavior associated with the magnetic catalysis in the system .",
    "( note that magnetic catalysis is not an effect exclusive to fermionic systems but can also occur in bosonic systems as well  @xcite , enlarging the symmetry - broken region in those systems ) .",
    "thus , in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field the transition happens at a higher critical temperature .",
    "we have shown that this competing effect of each component of the external magnetic field applied to the system can produce a rich phase diagram , with the production of multiple critical points and reentrant phase transitions .",
    "note that there are many systems that can display multiple phase transitions , most particularly in low - energy condensed matter systems , where they can be found more easily . at the quantum field theory level ,",
    "reentrant phases have been shown to be possible in systems with coupled scalar fields in the nonrelativistic limit  @xcite .",
    "multiple phase transitions can in principle also be found in relativistic systems .",
    "this can be the case , for example , in systems with two or more coupled scalar fields ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "multiple critical points in effective models for quantum chromodynamics have also been shown to be possible in ref .",
    "however , to our knowledge , no reentrant phase transitions of the type we have found here have been shown before to appear in fermionic relativistic systems .    as a way to determine the presence of multiple critical points and reentrant phase transitions ,",
    "we have computed the hall conductivity .",
    "we have seen that whenever a first - order phase transition happens , the hall conductivity jumps by a different amount at the critical point .",
    "this is a consequence of the different value assumed ( discontinuously ) for the chiral vacuum expectation value @xmath82 , as analyzed in sec .",
    "[ hallsection ] .",
    "since the hall conductivity @xmath172 is an important measurable quantity for diverse condensed matter systems , like for semiconductor materials , superconductor films and graphene , our results indicate a way that the presence of a gap in the system and quantum phase transitions may reflect on the measurements of @xmath172 .",
    "it is tempting to try to directly apply our results to the physics of graphene , for instance . in these systems we can have both components of the magnetic field acting concomitantly .",
    "however , in most studies ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) the zeeman energy term ( which for us here is given by the asymmetry term @xmath54 ) is much smaller than the energy splitting between landau levels .",
    "this is easily understood if we use typical values found in realistic planar condensed matter systems , including , for example , graphene .",
    "recall that the zeeman energy is @xmath199 , where @xmath200 is the total magnitude of the magnetic field . using @xmath201 , @xmath202 , where @xmath203  mev is the electron rest mass , @xmath204 and the conversion factor 1 tesla @xmath205 , we find , by expressing @xmath200 in terms of the perpendicular component of the field and the tilt angle @xmath58 ( see fig .",

    "the zeeman energy term @xmath54 is then comparable to @xmath211 only for extremely large values of the magnetic field ( e.g. , for @xmath212 teslas , when taking for instance that @xmath55 ) , or for a highly tilted magnetic field , such that @xmath213 . for typical laboratory magnetic fields of @xmath214 teslas or for a not - too - much tilted magnetic field ( such that @xmath215 )",
    ", we find that @xmath216 .",
    "so , indeed , under these circumstances , the zeeman energy term becomes negligible and also justifies neglecting it when @xmath217 .",
    "for the type of phenomena we have found in this paper , we can already find reentrant and multiple phase transitions for asymmetries as small as @xmath218 and at a temperature @xmath219 . taking a perpendicular component for the magnetic field of @xmath220 ( where we have reestablished again the fermi velocity in the expression for the landau energy levels , as appropriate for fermionic condensed matter systems ) and for a typical gap energy @xmath221 of around @xmath222 mev @xcite , we find @xmath223 k and a required field with @xmath224 teslas and , upon using eq .",
    "( [ dmu ] ) , we obtain @xmath225 , which then gives @xmath226 teslas .",
    "this corresponds to a highly tilted magnetic field in the direction of the system s plane , which is the expected physical situation where the effects of the zeeman energy term start to become important and can not be neglected , according to the estimates shown above ( for these values of parameters , the zeeman energy term @xmath54 is about @xmath227 of the value of @xmath211 ) .",
    "these estimates for the required values of magnetic fields seem reasonable and low enough to be achieved in the laboratory and this does not seem such a highly special situation to be produced in practice . besides , with the increasing precision being reached in the most recent experiments , it may be possible to realize such an experiment with superconductor films under these tuned conditions and probe the type of transitions we have found in this paper , for example through the measurements of the hall conductivity , as we have suggested .    in conclusion , we have seen that the opposite effects caused by magnetic fields , when applied parallel and perpendicular to the system s plane , can lead to a rich pattern of phase transitions .",
    "the results we have found here can have immediate applications in the context of the physics of planar condensed matter systems , including graphene , planar films of conducting polyacetylene and high - temperature superconductor films .",
    "in all these systems , the viability of their application as modern semiconductor devices is directly related to the ability of producing and controlling a gap .",
    "our results indicate that this control can be achieved through an appropriate doping of the system and under parallel and perpendicular magnetic fields , that are applied simultaneously and independently , when properly tuned .",
    "if these conditions can be achieved , then our results can open interesting possibilities for the uses of these type of materials in practical applications as novel electronic devices .",

    "<S> our results provide a possible way to probe experimentally chiral symmetry breaking and the corresponding emergence of a gap ( i.e. , the presence of a nonvanishing chiral vacuum expectation value ) in planar condensed matter systems of current interest . </S>"
