    "the observation of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) from the ground can be performed inside the atmospheric windows , far from the main emission lines of the most abundant molecules . for the experiments devoted to the measurement of the polarization properties of the cmb it is mandatory to evaluate , in addition , the effects of the atmosphere . in a recent paper @xcite the effects of ice crystal clouds in the upper troposphere",
    "have been considered , but the major effect arises from the polarized emission of the @xmath7 molecule .",
    "the relevance of this effect for cmb measurements has been pointed out by @xcite , where for the first time a quantitative evaluation of the polarized signals has been presented . also @xcite discuss the relevance of the polarized emission of the @xmath7 as a foreground for cmb observations .",
    "here we compute the polarized emission of the @xmath7 molecule , developing the formalism introduced in the pioneering works by @xcite .",
    "the interaction of the earth magnetic field with the magnetic dipole moment of the atmospheric @xmath7 molecule induces zeeman splitting onto the roto - vibrational lines . as a result of this interaction ,",
    "radiation becomes weakly circularly polarized with a degree of polarization @xmath8 .",
    "a linear polarization is also generated , but the signal is three or four orders of magnitude lower and still below the current detection sensitivity .",
    "this circularly polarized signal can be considered a contaminant for cmb ground - based experiments for two reasons .",
    "the first one is that non - idealities in the instrument can produce conversion from circular to linear polarization : this leakage from the @xmath1 stokes parameter to @xmath9 can be the source of a spurious signal if the circularly polarized radiation of atmospheric oxygen is picked - up by the instrument . here the effect on the recovery of the cosmological polarized signal is evident since cmb is expected to be only ( weakly ) linearly polarized @xcite .",
    "the second one is that there is an increasing theoretical effort dedicated to the physical mechanisms able to create a non vanishing cmb circular polarization .",
    "in fact , there are several attempts to add terms to the standard electromagnetic lagrangian density , and to predict observable effects arising from these extensions . among others , and without sake of completeness",
    ", we recall : test of the shiff conjecture on the eep @xcite ; coupling between photons and slowly varying pseudoscalar fields @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ; coupling between photons and pseudoscalar fields in presence of intergalactic magnetic fields @xcite ; coupling between photons and vector fields to test lorentz - invariance violating processes @xcite .",
    "authors , in all of these cases , show how a fundamental process induces optical activity in the intergalactic medium .",
    "in fact , the extensions of the standard lagrangian generate new terms in maxwell s equations ( see eq . 3 in @xcite ) , therefore leading to modified dispersion relations .",
    "we have to mention also the possibility of having a @xmath1-mode induced by last - scattering in a magnetized primordial plasma ( see @xcite ) and , after recombination , by intergalactic magnetic fields through faraday conversion @xcite .",
    "it is likely that , with increasing theoretical motivations , a dedicated experiment will be proposed in the near future to update the very early upper limits obtained by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the present work has been prepared also in this spirit .    in section 2 the basic physics of the process",
    "is presented , while in section 3 the tensor radiative transfer approach used to compute the atmospheric integrated signal is described .",
    "the analysis is applied to different sites : dome c ( antarctica ) , south pole , atacama ( chile ) , testa grigia ( italian alps ) , where mm - wave instruments are located .",
    "results are reported in section 4 .",
    "we compare the effect in different places and define the optimal observation bands in order to minimize the effect from this contaminant .",
    "@xmath0 is the only abundant atmospheric molecule with non - zero magnetic dipole moment , because the two electrons in the highest energy state couple with parallel spin .",
    "the presence of polarized radiation in the atmosphere is associated with the interaction of the magnetic dipole moment of the @xmath0 molecule and the earth magnetic field . in the millimeter wave region of the electromagnetic spectrum ,",
    "@xmath0 molecule presents a set of lines due to roto - vibrational transitions .",
    "the presence of the earth magnetic field induces zeeman splitting on these lines , which then become polarized .    because of the zeeman effect a quantum state represented by the quantum number @xmath10",
    "is split in @xmath11 states , each of them described by a different value of @xmath12 , under the condition @xmath13 .",
    "the selection rules permit the following transitions , @xmath14 ( called @xmath15 ) and @xmath16 ( called @xmath17 ) :    @xmath18    under these conditions , selection rules permit to have @xmath19 ( @xmath20 transitions ) and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 transitions ) . in table [ tab_freq2 ] we report the frequencies of @xmath0 roto - vibrational transitions allowed by the _ fermi golden rule _ and used for our calculation , together with their corresponding quantum number ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "we stop to @xmath24 because of lack of information about the line broadening and mixing parameters ( see @xcite ) of higher orders .",
    "we also verified the effect of adding lines with @xmath25 : far from the transition frequencies the difference is negligible ( @xmath26/@xmath27 ) .",
    ".line frequency and corresponding quantum number @xmath23 used for the computation of the atmospheric @xmath0 polarized signal . [ cols=\">,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     as shown by tables [ tab_err_b ] and [ tab_err_tp ] the accuracy is of the order of @xmath28k .",
    "larger effects arise in case of large magnetic disturbances or seasonal changes .",
    "we did not take into account the line profile model .",
    "the line frequencies are known with negligible error bars , but the oxigen absorption values have error bars of at least 5% at 90 ghz .",
    "this accuracy applies up to @xmath29 120 ghz , but at higher frequencies model and values of oxigen absorption are not yet validated and calculations should be used with caution .",
    "the effect of these uncertainties should be added to the accuracy quoted previously .",
    "it is also important to stress that the computed uncertainty refers to the total power polarized signal .",
    "usually we are interested to subtract signal gradients between different observing directions , and the related uncertainty is definitely smaller than the total estimated value of @xmath30 , in particular for small angular scales .",
    "in this paper we evaluate the contribution of atmospheric @xmath0 zeeman split roto - vibrational lines in the mm - wave part of the electromagnetic spectrum , seen as a contaminant for cmb polarization experiments . a code to simulate this signal for various sites (",
    "dome c and south pole in the antarctica , testa grigia in the italian alps and atacama , chile ) of interest for mm - wave astronomy has been developed on the basis of the theory developed in @xcite and @xcite ) . in this way",
    "we compute a template of the atmospheric circularly polarized signal for every site provided that the vertical profiles of atmospheric pressure and temperature are available .",
    "maps of the circularly polarized signal in local coordinates have been obtained for each site examined .",
    "these maps show a dipole - like large scale feature with a maximum gradient aligned approximately , for low - mid latitude sites , with the north - south direction , and for polar sites , along the magnetic field lines .",
    "atacama is the examined place where the polarized signal at the zenith is the lowest .",
    "this is due to the altitude of the site and to the amplitude and direction of the magnetic field . unfortunately scanning experiments at atacama suffer a larger polarized gradient with respect to other sites .",
    "in fact the angular variation of the signal is of order @xmath31 at 90 ghz for all sites except dome c , where it is a factor @xmath29 4@xmath327 lower , because here the atmospheric polarized signal is the flattest , along the full local visible sky .",
    "we then evaluated the integrated polarized signal inside an ideal bandpass of a wide - band ( @xmath33 ) experiment for 3 mm - wave atmospheric windows between 10 and 200 ghz .",
    "we found the frequencies where it is more convenient to observe , because here the signal vanishes or decreases significantly .",
    "finally , an estimate of the template accuracy and variation has been done , using the main features of the magnetic field and the statistics of measured atmospheric profiles . at 90 ghz",
    ", we obtained a typical uncertainty of the order of @xmath29 1 @xmath28k , dominated by accuracy and variability of the atmospheric parameters .",
    "large variations ( up to @xmath29 10 - 15 @xmath28k ) are expected in case of large magnetic disturbances and due to seasonal atmospheric variations .",
    "uncertainty and secular variation of the magnetic field have , on the other hand , a negligible effect .",
    "a linear polarization is also generated and it is larger when the line of sight is orthogonal to the earth magnetic field . however",
    "the ratio of linear to circular polarization is @xmath34 , therefore still below the current detection sensitivity .",
    "moreover the non vanishing component of linear polarization is nearly aligned with the earth magnetic field .",
    "authors want to acknowledge p. rosenkranz and s. hanany for the precious contribution to the improvement of the paper .",
