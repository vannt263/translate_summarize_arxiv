    "the phenomenon of strong dissipation in the collective motions of heated nuclear systems is a challenging problem for the nuclear transport theory . following the analogy with other fermi liquids , like the liquid @xmath2he @xcite",
    ", one expects also in nuclear systems two types of collective modes",
    ".    at small temperatures the mean field dominated modes should exist , from the possible violatation of the local thermal equilibrium due to the strong pauli blocking which inhibits two - body collisions ( the landau zero sounds ) .",
    "this is actually the main nature of isoscalar giant resonances , where indeed the collective energy is essentially given by the amount needed to deform the fermi sphere in momentum space @xcite .",
    "isovector giant resonances are also mean field modes , this time of plasmon type since we can have both a distortion and a shift of the neutron ( proton ) fermi spheres .    at high temperatures the usual hydrodynamical collective modes ( first sounds ) should propagate @xcite . in an infinite fermi liquid with strong repulsion ( landau parameter @xmath3 )",
    "the two sounds are clearly distinguishable , since the damping rate has a maximum as a function of the temperature @xcite . however , in nuclear matter the transition between the two sounds is expected to be smeared - out since the landau parameter @xmath4 is small in absolute value @xcite .",
    "the presence of this transition is still an open problem in nuclear dynamics .",
    "only the isovector giant dipole resonances can be experimentally studied with sufficient accuracy in heated nuclei .",
    "the point is that for this kind of two - component mode the transition has some special features that make it difficult to observe a clear signature @xcite .",
    "aim of this work is to study the transition in the collective nuclear dynamics looking at the evolution of the damping mechanism of large amplitude quadrupole oscillations in fusion processes , in a microscopic kinetic model .",
    "similar attempts have been recently performed in fission dynamics studies @xcite .",
    "we will also follow the temperature dependence of the attenuation of the collective mode .",
    "in the ref.s @xcite a reduced friction coefficient @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the collective kinetic energy of the dinuclear system ( dns ) and @xmath7 is the dissipation rate of the total collective energy @xmath8 , has been extracted from the measurements of the prescission neutron multiplicity in fast fission reactions .",
    "it was shown that in the temperature region @xmath9 mev the reduced friction coefficient @xmath10 is very large ( @xmath11 s@xmath12 ) , result not explained with a one - body dissipation mechanism only .    in the present work",
    "we have performed some kinetic transport studies of the nuclear dynamics .",
    "transport equations describe a self - consistent mean field dynamics coupled to two - body collisions and so we expect to see in a natural way the transition between the two sound propagations .",
    "we use the boltzmann - nordheim - vlasov ( bnv ) @xcite procedure to simulate the phase space dynamics , which has been quite successful in predicting mean properties of heavy ion collisions at medium energies .",
    "in particular we study central nucleus - nucleus collisions leading to fusion at beam energies @xmath13 amev in order to extract the coefficient @xmath10 as a function of the temperature from the damping of the collective quadrupole oscillations of the formed di - nuclear system ( dns ) .",
    "density dependent effective interactions of skyrme type ( @xmath14 @xcite ) and an averaged free nucleon - nucleon cross section , @xmath15 ( @xcite ) have been used .    the structure of the work is as follows . in sect .",
    "2 the procedure of the extraction of the reduced damping coefficient @xmath10 from the time dependence of the quadrupole moment given by the bnv model is described . in sect .",
    "3 we present a novel method for determination of the temperature based on the energy conservation and on the bnv evolution of the potential energy . sect .",
    "4 contains our results on the @xmath16 and their interpretation in terms of two - body and one - body dissipation mechanisms .",
    "summary and conclusions are given in sect .",
    "according to eq . ( [ beta ] ) , the reduced friction coefficient @xmath10 can be , in principle , calculated directly , once the phase - space distribution function @xmath17 is known from the bnv output , since : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the fermi energy , @xmath20 is the nuclear mean field interaction energy density and @xmath21 is the coulomb energy . from eq.([ekincoll ] ) we see that the beam energy is not giving contribution to the collective kinetic energy .",
    "however , in practice , the calculation of the collective kinetic energy @xmath22 is quite ambiguous in the test particle technique due to the strong dependence on the width of the gaussians representing the test particles @xcite .",
    "we calculate then the coefficient @xmath10 from the time evolution of the quadrupole moment of the dns : @xmath23 for a damped periodical motion ( see appendix ) @xmath24 the coefficient @xmath10 is proportional to the imaginary part of the frequency @xmath25 : @xmath26    the curves in fig .",
    "1 show the time evolution of @xmath27 in the case of central collisions of @xmath28ni + @xmath29u at beam energies @xmath30 amev .",
    "the quadrupole moment quickly approaches a minimum at @xmath31 fm / c .",
    "afterwards the @xmath27 starts to grow again , and after a time interval @xmath32 fm / c it saturates .",
    "this saturation of the @xmath27 is caused by an almost complete lost of the collective energy of the dns .",
    "one can , therefore , qualitatively estimate the @xmath10 coefficient just assuming that @xmath33 , where @xmath34 fm / c is the period of oscillations .",
    "that gives @xmath35 s. this value is in agreement with the results obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite . however , we would like to stress that in refs .",
    "@xcite the damping coefficient was extracted from the outgoing part of the trajectory of the dns from compact mononucleus shape to scission during a time interval @xmath36 fm / c .",
    "our analysis is concentrated on the part of the trajectory _ in vicinity of the mononucleus shape _ and the corresponding time scale @xmath37 fm / c is much shorter .    in order to get the values of the coefficient @xmath10 we fit a part of the curve @xmath38 to the function @xmath39 the upper time limit of the fitting region is chosen at the second minimum of the quadrupole moment .",
    "the lower time limit is given by the earliest time when the same value of the @xmath27 as in the second minimum is reached .",
    "this definition of the time limits , from one hand , corresponds approximately to the selection of a full oscillation in vicinity of the compact mononucleus shape . on the other hand ,",
    "the stage of strong dissipation from the first minimum to the first maximum is completely in the fitting region .",
    "the best fit functions of eq .",
    "( [ qzzfit ] ) are shown by full dots in fig.1 .",
    "the fitting parameters @xmath40 and the corresponding coefficient @xmath41 for central collisions of @xmath28ni + @xmath29u at various beam energies are collected in the _",
    "table_. we see that the damping increases with the increasing collision energy until @xmath42 amev .",
    "this fact can be understood already from fig .",
    "1 , since with increasing beam energy a larger @xmath43 is damped during a shorter time interval .",
    "but at higher energies @xmath44 amev the damping starts to decrease , as we can see from the presence of quadrupole vibrations at later times @xmath45 fm / c ( fig .",
    "1 ) . eventually at @xmath46 amev a kind of saturation seems to be reached .",
    "a direct way to extract the temperature is to fit the local momentum distribution given by the bnv model to a @xmath47 fermi distribution .",
    "however , in the case of low - energy nuclear collsions studied in present work , this direct method is not appropriate just because its accuracy of @xmath48 mev is not enough .",
    "therefore we will follow a procedure based on the conservation of the energy and on the time evolution of the potential energy given by the bnv .",
    "the thermal excitation energy of the dns is ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the center - of - mass kinetic energy , @xmath51 is the coulomb energy , @xmath52 ( fm ) @xmath53 are the nuclear radii , @xmath54 is the rotational energy with @xmath55 being the angular momentum ( in @xmath56 units ) and @xmath57 m_{nuc } $ ] being the momentum of inertia ( @xmath58 is the nucleon mass ) .",
    "the last term @xmath59 in the r.h.s . of eq.([eexc ] ) is the difference between the values of the potential energy just before and after the overlapping of the density profiles .",
    "the origin of this term is mostly from the sharp decrease of the nuclear surface energy when the two nuclei touch each other . in fig .",
    "2 we show the time dependence of the potential energy per nucleon in the central collision of @xmath28ni + @xmath29u at 10.53 amev . after some small increase until @xmath60 fm / c due to the coulomb contribution the total potential energy quickly drops by about 1 mev / nucleon reaching the minimum at @xmath61 fm / c .",
    "we define @xmath59 as @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the first minimum and the first maximum of the potential energy .",
    "in the _ table _ we report the values of the potential energy `` jumps '' @xmath59 , the excitation energies and corresponding temperatures @xmath65 for the @xmath28ni + @xmath29u central collisions at various beam energies in eq .",
    "( [ eexc ] ) ] .",
    "our temperatures are higher than those obtained in ref . @xcite .",
    "in particular , for the ni+u collision at 6.53 amev we have @xmath66 mev and the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite report @xmath67 mev .",
    "this difference is mainly explained by the fact , that the temperatures in ref.@xcite are obtained from the outgoing stage of the reaction on much larger time scales as compared to our study .",
    "a further contribute to some temperature overshooting is coming from pre - equilibrium emissions , neglected in the energy balance eq.([eexc ] ) .",
    "this effect , although expected to increase with beam energy , can be still considered quite small in this energy range .",
