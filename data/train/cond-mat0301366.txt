    "<S> low temperature specific heat has been measured for an overdoped @xmath0 ( x = 0.22 ) single crystal . </S>",
    "<S> the quasiparticle density of states ( dos ) in the mixed state is found to deviate from the predicted scaling law @xmath1 . however , this scaling behavior is nicely reconciled if one considers the normal core region ( @xmath2 21@xmath3 ) which gives small contribution to the total dos </S>",
    "<S> . the radius of the core and other parameters derived are consistent with reported values . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that there is no zero - bias conductance peak ( zbcp ) , which is predicted by the simple bogoliubov de - gennes theory in the vortex core of a d - wave superconductor .    </S>",
    "<S> one of few points with consensus in the cuprate superconductors is the @xmath4 pairing symmetry in hole doped cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> this has been supported by tremendous experiments @xcite both from surface detection@xcite and bulk measurements@xcite . in a d - wave superconductor with line nodes in the gap function , </S>",
    "<S> the quasiparticle density of states ( dos ) @xmath5 rises linearly with energy at the fermi level in zero field , @xmath6 , resulting in an electronic specific heat @xmath7 @xcite , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the specific heat coefficient reflecting the dos at the fermi level of normal state . in the mixed state with the field </S>",
    "<S> higher than a certain value , the dos near the fermi surface becomes finite , therefore the quadratic term @xmath7 will be surpassed and substituted by both the localized excitations inside the vortex core and the de - localized excitations outside the core . </S>",
    "<S> volovik @xcite pointed out that for d - wave superconductors in the mixed state , supercurrents around a vortex core lead to a doppler shift to the quasi - particle excitation spectrum , which affects strongly the low energy excitation around the nodes . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that the contribution from the delocalized part will prevail over the core part and the specific heat is predicted to behave as @xmath10 with @xmath11 a parameter in the order of unity . </S>",
    "<S> this prediction has been verified by many specific heat measurements which were taken as the evidence for d - wave pairing symmetry@xcite . in the finite temperature and field region </S>",
    "<S> a scaling law is proposed@xcite    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is a unknown scaling function . </S>",
    "<S> this scaling law has been proved in @xmath14@xcite and in optimally doped lsco@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it remains however unclear whether this scaling law is still valid in the overdoped region .    </S>",
    "<S> another important but controversial issue is the vortex core state in the cuprate superconductors . by solving the mean - field bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equation , </S>",
    "<S> theoretically it is suggested that a zero - bias conductance peak ( zbcp ) exists in the vortex core@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however this is in sharp contrast with the experimental observations@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of zbcp was attributed to the presence of @xmath15 or @xmath16 components@xcite . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we show that the dos due to vortex quasi - particle excitations deviates from simon - lee scaling law , but it can be nicely reconciled if the vortex core size is taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore a consequence from our analysis is the absence of zbcp in the vortex core and the disappearance is intrinsic rather than due to the second component of order parameters .     at magnetic fields ranging from 0 to 12 t for the overdoped single crystal . </S>",
    "<S> the inset shows the diamagnetic transition at around 27.4 k determined by the crossing point of the extrapolating line of the most steep part with the normal state background m = 0 . , </S>",
    "<S> width=302 ]    the single crystals measured in this work were prepared by the travelling solvent floating - zone technique . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we present data of an overdoped single crystal ( x = 0.22 , @xmath17 ) as characterized by ac susceptibility and dc magnetization ( shown by the inset in fig.1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the quality of our sample has also been characterized by x - ray diffraction patterns showing only ( 00l ) peaks , and resistive measurement showing a rather narrow transition temperature @xmath18 2 k. a piece about 28.55 mg in mass , @xmath19 in dimension , was chosen for the specific heat measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the heat capacity data presented here were taken with the relaxation method @xcite based on an oxford cryogenic system maglab . </S>",
    "<S> the heat capacity is determined by a direct measurement of the thermal time constant , @xmath20 , here @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the heat capacity of the sample and addenda ( including a small sapphire substrate , small printed film heater , tiny cernox temperature senser , @xmath2325 @xmath24 gold wire leads , wakefield thermal conducting grease ( @xmath25 ) ) respectively , where @xmath26 is the thermal conductance between the chip and a thermal link . </S>",
    "<S> the value @xmath22 has been measured and subtracted from the total capacitance , thus @xmath21 value reported here is only the capacitance of the sample . we have also checked the field dependence of @xmath22 and found that the change ( if any ) of @xmath22 under 12 t is in the same order of the noise background here ( 20 nj / k at 5 k and 40 nj / k at 20 k ) . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of the magnetic field ( 12 t ) on the readout of the thermometer is below 0.02 k and can be neglected . during the measurement the field </S>",
    "<S> was applied parallel to c - axis and the sample was cooled to the lowest temperature under a magnetic field ( field - cooling ) followed by data acquisition in the warming up process .    </S>",
    "<S> fig.1 shows the specific heat coefficient @xmath27 as a function of @xmath28 in magnetic fields ranging from 0 to 12 t. the separation between each field can be well determined . in low temperature region </S>",
    "<S> the curves are rather linear showing that the major part is due to phonon contribution @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition the curve at zero field extrapolates to a finite value ( @xmath30 ) at 0 k instead of zero as observed in other cuprate superconductors . this may be interpreted as potential scattering to the vanishing gaps near the node of @xmath4 gap function due to small amount impurities@xcite . as also observed by other groups for @xmath31 system </S>",
    "<S> , the anomalous upturn of @xmath27 due to the schottky anomaly of free spins is very weak@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this avoids the complexity in the data analysis . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that the phonon part has a very weak field dependence , this allows to remove the phonon contribution by subtracting the @xmath27 at a certain field with that at zero field . </S>",
    "<S> the results after the substraction are shown in fig.2 . </S>",
    "<S> the subtracted values @xmath32 show a rather linear @xmath33 behavior in low temperature region ( below 8 k ) as indicated by the solid lines . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis is based on the data below 12 k. in the following we will show that the field dependent slope of the linear part in low temperature region shown in fig.2 directly deviates from the simon - lee@xcite scaling law ( eq.1 ) .    . </S>",
    "<S> a linear behavior is clearly seen in low temperature region which is not in accord with the proposed scaling law ( eq.1 ) by simon and lee ( see text ) . </S>",
    "<S> the linear lines in low temperature region are guides to the eyes . from these lines </S>",
    "<S> one can determine the zero temperature intercept @xmath34 and the slope @xmath35 shown in fig.3 , width=302 ]    according to the scaling law , the low temperature expansion of right hand side reads    @xmath36    where @xmath37=0 because @xmath38 should be finite when @xmath39 and @xmath40 . since @xmath41 is very small in low temperature region , one has @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath43 , the total specific heat contains four parts : doppler shift term from the region outside the core @xmath44 , the inner vortex core term @xmath45 , the small impurity scattering term @xmath46 and the phonon term @xmath47 . at zero field , the total specific heat contains three parts : the small impurity scattering term @xmath46 and the phonon term @xmath47 both depend on magnetic field weakly , and a quadratic term @xmath48 due to the thermal excitation near the nodal region . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath49 can be written as :    @xmath50    from eq.3 it is clear that @xmath49 depends on t through the second term , however the slope @xmath51 is @xmath52 independent according to the definition . </S>",
    "<S> this clearly indicates that the simon - lee scaling law can not be directly applied to interpret the field dependent slope of @xmath49 vs. @xmath33 as shown in fig.2 .    in order to understand the underlying physics , still based on the simon - lee scaling law , we propose that the core size effect has a sizable influence on the total vortex quasi - particle excitations . by taking account the vortex core size ( @xmath53 ) </S>",
    "<S> , one can rewrite @xmath49 as :    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the radius of the normal core , @xmath56 is the radius of a single vortex @xmath57 . thus eq.4 can be written as :    @xmath58    one immediately realizes that the third term in eq.5 is just what we need for interpreting the difficulty as mentioned above . </S>",
    "<S> next let us have a closer inspection at the data and derive some parameters . </S>",
    "<S> at zero temperature , only the first term and the last term are left . </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath59 are determined from the extrapolation of the linear lines in fig.2 to 0 k and presented in fig.3 . </S>",
    "<S> the solid line is a fit to the data using the first term in eq.5 yielding @xmath60 and @xmath61 and thus @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> the value @xmath62 derived here is quite close to that found in nernst@xcite and stm measurements@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also tried to use the first term together with the last term to fit the data but find out that the contribution from the last term is extremely small . </S>",
    "<S> the first term here describes the zero temperature data very well , indicating the absence of a bulk second order parameter such as @xmath15 or @xmath16 since otherwise the nodal point would be filled completely and the doppler shift had very weak effect on the quasi - particle excitations . </S>",
    "<S> the inset of fig.3 shows the field dependence of the slope of the linear part in fig.2 . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the slope increases with h above 1 t. this can be exactly anticipated by the second and third terms in eq.5 . from the inset of fig.3 one obtains @xmath63 and @xmath64 . by taking @xmath65 </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the following values : @xmath66 and @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that @xmath68 , we further obtain @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , it is predicted that @xmath70 which yields also @xmath71 if taking @xmath72 and @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> two different approaches lead to rather close values of @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> this value is also close to that found in @xmath74@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the nice fitting in fig.3 with only the first term of eq.5 suggests that the core region has very small contribution to the dos since otherwise the last term @xmath75 should be sizeable . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the low energy dos inside the vortex core is very small , ruling out the presence of zbcp as expected by the bdg theory for a d - wave superconductor@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion is further strengthened in the following by the fact that the core size effect has a sizeable influence on the dos due to doppler shift , but the contribution from inner part of the core is small . in order to further test our idea ( eq.5 ) , we present the scaling of @xmath76 vs. @xmath77 in fig.4 with @xmath51 derived above . </S>",
    "<S> the quality of our scaling is remarkable . </S>",
    "<S> this can be easily understood from eq.5 when the correction @xmath78 at 12 t ) to the first term is very small . </S>",
    "<S> the slight scattering in the high temperature and field region is due to the noise of the data . </S>",
    "<S> worthy of noting is that to have this nice scaling we need to take @xmath79 , again showing a small contribution from the inner vortex core . </S>",
    "<S> the solid line is a theoretical curve from eq.5 by using the parameters derived above . </S>",
    "<S> both the nice scaling and the consistency between the experimental data and eq.5 suggest that the simon - lee scaling law can be reconciled by considering the vortex core size effect </S>",
    "<S> . meanwhile the scaling according to the original simon - lee theory is also presented in the inset of fig.4 . showing a rather poor scaling quality .    . </S>",
    "<S> the remarkable consistency between data and theory based on @xmath4 symmetry indicates that we do nt have any second component such as @xmath15 or @xmath80s at fields ranging from 0 to 12 t. the inset shows the slope @xmath35 of the straight lines shown in fig.2 in low temperature region . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line is a linear fit to the data at fields above one tesla . </S>",
    "<S> the intercept and the slope of the dashed line give rise to the pre - factors of the second and third terms in eq.5,width=302 ]     vs. @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> the solid line is a theoretical fit according to eq.5 with fitting parameters derived in the text . </S>",
    "<S> a perfect scaling and a nice consistency between data and the scaling law with core - size correction is clear . </S>",
    "<S> the inset shows the scaling according to simon and lee ( eq.1 ) where @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> , width=302 ]    in low temperature region , our analysis indicates that the field induced dos can be well described by volovik s theory or simon - lee scaling law although a correction due to the core size effect is needed . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the prerequisite for the theory , i.e. , the @xmath4 pairing symmetry is well satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> therefore it naturally rules out the possible presence of a second order parameter like @xmath15 or @xmath16 either due to overdoping@xcite or due to the field effect@xcite in the present overdoped sample . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile another seemingly contradicted phenomenon is that the vortex core region contributes very little ( at least much smaller than that induced by the doppler shift if the super - current would flow in the same area ) to the total dos . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that there is no zbcp within the normal core since otherwise the normal core region should give rise to a sizable signal . </S>",
    "<S> our conclusion is consistent with the tunnelling results@xcite and certainly clears up the concerns about the surface conditions in the stm measurement since our specific heat data reflect the bulk property . </S>",
    "<S> recent results from nmr also show the absence of zbcp inside the vortex core@xcite . in this sense our data together with the earlier nmr data present a bulk evidence for an anomalous vortex core . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly it is widely perceived that the normal state in overdoped region shows a fermi liquid behavior even when the superconductivity is completely suppressed@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> clearly the mean - field frame of bdg theory based on the conventional d - wave superconductivity is not enough to interpret the anomalous vortex core state .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> the quasiparticle density of states ( dos ) due to doppler shift in the mixed state of an overdoped @xmath0 ( x = 0.22 ) single crystal is found to deviate from the proposed scaling law of simon and lee . however , this law is reconciled if one considers the core size effect . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution from the inner vortex core is small comparing to that due to the doppler shift in the same area . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest the absence of the zbcp in the vortex core although it is expected by the bogoliubov de - gennes theory for a d - wave superconductor . </S>"
