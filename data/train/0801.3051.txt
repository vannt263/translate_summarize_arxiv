    "the present work emphasizes and details the mechanical nature of the kinetic temperature , in contrast to the ensemble - based configurational temperature .",
    "simulations for the simple models considered here are insensitive to system size and show significant differences between the kinetic and configurational temperatures .",
    "our main goal is to illustrate and emphasize the relative advantages of kinetic temperature , particularly away from equilibrium .",
    "ever since the early days of molecular dynamics `` temperature '' has been based on the familiar ideal - gas kinetic - energy definition . for a cartesian degree of freedom at equilibrium",
    "the kinetic definition is : @xmath1 this definition provides a means for linking gibbs and boltzmann s classical statistical mechanics to thermodynamics . because thermodynamic equilibrium corresponds to the maxwell - boltzmann velocity distribution , @xmath2 \\ , \\ ] ] _ _ any of the even moments , @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 can be used to define the temperature for a system _ at _ equilibrium .",
    "the second - moment choice is not only the simplest , but in the ideal - gas case it also corresponds to a conserved quantity , the energy .",
    "the same definition of temperature is a fully consistent choice _",
    "away _ from equilibrium too .",
    "an _ ideal - gas thermometer _ can be visualized as a collection of many very small , light , and weakly - interacting particles , but with such a high collision rate that thermal equilibrium ( the maxwell - boltzmann distribution ) is _ always _ maintained within the thermometer .",
    "for an innovative implementation of this model with molecular dynamics see ref . [ 1 ] .    _ configurational _ temperature definitions are also possible .",
    "there are two motivations for considering such coordinate - based temperatures : first , there is some ambiguity in determining the mean velocity in a transient inhomogeneous flow  kinetic temperature has to be measured relative to the flow velocity while configurational temperature does not ; second , the search for novelty .",
    "the simplest of the many configurational possiblities was suggested and also implemented by jepps in his thesis@xcite . in independent research , directed toward finding a canonical - ensemble dynamics consistent with configurational temperature , travis and braga developed an implementation identical to jepps unpublished algorithm@xcite . the underlying expression for the configurational temperature",
    ", @xmath7 appeared over 50 years ago in landau and lifshitz statistical physics text@xcite . in the definition of @xmath8 the force @xmath9 for a particular degree of freedom",

    "in fact , there are _ many _ other such nonmechanical temperature expressions . away from equilibrium",
    "it is clear that no finite number of moments or averages can be expected to uniquely define a phase - space distribution function . for a thorough discussion",
    "[ 2 ] and [ 3 ] .",
    "long before this complexity surfaced the proper definition of temperature away from equilibrium was a lively subject . to capture",
    "some of its flavor over a 30-year period see refs . [ 5 ] and [ 6 ] .",
    "relatively cumbersome microcanonical versions of configurational temperature have been developed following rugh s investigations . for references and an early application of these variants see morriss and rondoni s work@xcite .",
    "jou and his coworkers and their critics@xcite have considered the desirability of measuring an  operational \"  thermodynamic \" temperature for nonequilibrium systems .",
    "they discussed and then implemented a method@xcite ( which we explore in more detail here ) for its measurement .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the simplest case of their idea , a heat conductor connected to a  thermometer \" . as usual",
    ", the devil is in the details . here",
    "the details include both the _ type _ of thermometer used and the linkage connecting that thermometer to the conducting system .",
    "the linkage certainly has an effect on the forces and internal energy at the linkage point , and hence affects the local - thermodynamic - equilibrium temperature and the configurational temperature .",
    "in addition to their `` operational '' temperature , jou _ et alii _ also consider a `` langevin temperature '' , @xmath14 ( the temperature which enters explicitly into the usual equilibrium langevin equations of motion ) and a `` local thermodynamic equilibrium '' temperature , @xmath15 ( the temperature based on the equilibrium equation of state , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the internal energy per unit mass ) .",
    "_ at _ equilibrium , and only at equilibrium , all of the various temperatures are the same and there is no ambiguity in the temperature concept : @xmath18 } \\ .\\ ] ] _ away from _ equilibrium , where most physical interpretations of temperature are actually symmetric second - rank tensors , we can expect that each of the these four `` temperatures '' differs from the others .",
    "tensor _ nature of temperature is evident in strong shockwaves@xcite .",
    "generally we must anticipate that nonequilibrium temperature can be anisotropic , with @xmath19 this anisotropicity makes it imperative to describe the microscopic mechanics of any nonequilibrium thermometer in detail and argues strongly against a nonequilibrium version of the zeroth law of thermodynamics .",
    "in their illustrative example , jou and hatano@xcite used the temperature of a langevin oscillator@xcite coupled to a driven oscillator to measure the driven oscillator s temperature .",
    "a langevin oscillator is damped with a constant friction coefficient and driven with a random force@xcite .",
    "see also the next - to - last paragraph of sec .",
    "ii . jou and hatano@xcite found that their measured temperature was qualitatively sensitive to the assumed form of coupling linking their `` system '' ( the driven oscillator ) to their `` thermometer '' ( the langevin oscillator ) .    at equilibrium , thermometry , and thermodynamics",
    "itself , both rely on the observation often called the `` zeroth law of thermodynamics '' , that two bodies in thermal equilibrium with a third are also in thermal equilibrium with each other ( independent of the couplings linking the bodies ) .",
    "jou and hatano drew the very reasonable conclusion from their work that this fundamental property of temperature , which makes equilibrium thermometry possible , might be _ impossible _ away from equilibrium .",
    "baranyai@xcite considered a much more complicated thermometer , a tiny crystallite , made up of a few hundred tightly - bound miniparticles .",
    "he compared both the kinetic and the configurational temperatures of nonequilibrium flows with the temperatures within his thermometer and found substantial differences .",
    "baranyai was able to conclude from his work that neither the kinetic nor the configurational temperature was a `` good '' nonequilibrium temperature . by this , he meant that neither satisfied the zeroth law of thermodynamics .",
    "the temperature within baranyai s minicrystal thermometer , his `` operational temperature '' , exhibited relatively small spatial variations ( the entire many - body thermometer was about the same size as a single particle of the nonequilibrium system in which it was immersed ) .    there is a considerable literature extending irreversible thermodynamics away from equilibrium , based on defining the nonequilibrium temperature , in terms of an ( ill - defined ) nonequilibrium entropy : @xmath20 for a recent guide to the literature see ref .",
    "[ 17 ] .    _",
    "at _ equilibrium , gibbs and boltzmann showed that the entropy @xmath21 of a classical system is simply the averaged logarithm of the phase - space probability density , @xmath22 _ away from _",
    "equilibrium @xmath23 is typically fractal@xcite ( so that its logarithm diverges ) , so that the very existence of a _ nonequilibrium _ entropy appears doubtful . for a comprehensive review of efforts based on a _ nonequilibrium _ gibbs entropy ,",
    "presumably @xmath24 , see ref .",
    "it is evident that such efforts are inconsistent with what is known about the singular fractal nature of nonequilibrium phase space distributions , @xmath25 .",
    "recent thorough work by daivis@xcite investigated the consequences of an _ assumed _ nonequilibrium entropy .",
    "daivis compared three equalities ( analogous to the equilibrium maxwell relations ) based on the assumed existence of @xmath26 with results from numerical simulations . _ none _ of the three  equalities \" was satisfied by the simulation results , casting doubt on both the existence of a nonequilibrium entropy analogous to the gibbs - boltzmann entropy , and also on the existence of a corresponding entropy - based temperature .    in the present work",
    "we will explore these ideas for a simple nonequilibrium model of heat flow , the @xmath27 model@xcite .",
    "this very basic model has quadratic hookes - law interactions linking nearest neighbor pairs of particles .",
    "in addition , each particle is tethered to its individual lattice site with a quartic potential .",
    "this model has been extremely useful for nonequilibrium statistical mechanics . in its most useful temperature range [ where the particles are sufficiently localized , as detailed in sec .",
    "iv ] we will see that the internal energy varies nearly linearly with kinetic temperature , simplifying analyses .",
    "the model obeys fourier s law ( for small enough temperature gradients for the equivalence of all the various temperature definitions ) , even in one dimension@xcite .",
    "it can also display considerable phase - space dimensionality loss@xcite , establishing the fractal nature of the phase - space distribution function .",
    "because the loss can exceed the phase - space dimensionality associated with the thermostating particles , a _ fractal _ distribution for the interior newtonian part of a driven nonequilibrium system is implied by these results .",
    "we use the @xmath27 model here to elucidate and compare the kinetic and configurational candidates for nonequilibrium temperature .",
    "though the mechanical models we consider are small , with only a few dozen degrees of freedom , we firmly believe that the analysis of such very specific manageable models is the only reliable guide to an understanding of thermometry and temperature . the pitfalls and complexities associated with large systems , and with large thermometers ,",
    "are the gradients and inhomogeneities already seen in baranyai s work@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first , a discussion of mechanical thermometry , using the ideal - gas thermometer , with simulations corresponding to ideal gases of disks ( two dimensions ) and spheres ( three dimensions ) ; next , a description of the computer experiment suggested by jou as applied to the @xmath27 model . after discussing and illustrating the @xmath27 model , numerical results , and conclusions based on them ,",
    "make up the final sections of this work .",
    "hoover , holian , and posch@xcite described the mechanics of a one - dimensional ideal - gas thermometer in detail .",
    "they considered a massive particle , with momentum @xmath28 , interacting with a maxwell - boltzmann bath of ideal - gas particles with momenta @xmath29 . here",
    "we will consider the same situation in detail for two- and three - dimensional thermometers .",
    "a typical collision can be viewed in the center - of - mass frame , a coordinate frame with the center - of - mass velocity : @xmath30 for an instantaneous hard - sphere impulsive collision the direction of the _ relative _ velocities in this frame , averaged over all possible collisions of the two velocities , @xmath31 is directed _ randomly _ after collision .",
    "this simplification leads to a systematic expansion@xcite of the energy change of the massive particle in half - integral powers of the mass ratio @xmath32 . to second order in @xmath33 : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the ideal gas kinetic temperature .",
    "for the details of other models ( soft spheres , square wells , ... ) of the interaction between the massive particle and an ideal - gas - thermometer heat bath a solution of the corresponding boltzmann equation would be required .",
    "nevertheless , on physical grounds it is  obvious \" that a massive particle with ( above / below)-average energy will ( lose / gain ) energy , on the average , as a result of its collisions with the equilibrating bath , @xmath36    it is an interesting exercise in numerical kinetic theory to confirm this expectation in two and three dimensions .",
    "consider first a hard disk with unit radius and mass @xmath37 with unit velocity @xmath38 .",
    "scattering for disks is anisotropic . on the average a disk retains a memory of its original velocity in the center - of - mass frame . to model",
    "the interaction of a massive disk with a heat bath of unit - mass - point particles at kinetic temperature @xmath35 requires choosing maxwell - boltzmann bath - particle velocities @xmath39 as well as an angle @xmath40 for each collision , which specifies the location of the colliding bath particle relative to the massive disk .",
    "see fig . 2 for typical results .",
    "these were obtained by using a random number generator@xcite to simulate the collisions .",
    "the velocity changes of the disk , @xmath41 , and the bath particle , @xmath42 , are as follows for a collision described by the angle @xmath43 : @xmath44 \\ ; \\\\ ] ] @xmath45 \\ .\\ ] ] a sufficiently long series of velocity changes @xmath46 , computed in this way , can be used to find the averaged hard - disk energy change shown in the figure .",
    "results for @xmath47 and five million randomly - chosen hard - disk collisions for each ideal - gas temperature are shown in fig .",
    "2 . in analyzing these simulations",
    "it is necessary to weight the summed - up contributions of all the observed collisions with the relative velocities corresponding to each collison @xmath48 : @xmath49 the speed @xmath50 is included because the collision rate for two randomly located particles with velocities @xmath51 and @xmath52 is directly proportional to the magnitude of their relative velocity , @xmath53 .",
    "as expected , the temperature at which the disk kinetic energy , for @xmath37 equal to one hundred , is equal to the averaged mass - point thermal energy , is 50 : @xmath54 the analogous averaged mass - point thermal energy is @xmath55 for hard spheres .",
    "energy changes for both disks and spheres are shown in fig .",
    "the simplicity of such a mechanical model for a thermometer  which `` measures temperature '' in terms of the kinetic energy per particle  recommends its use in analyzing nonequilibrium simulations .    the _ configurational _ temperature ,",
    "on the other hand , has no corresponding mechanical model , and also requires that the quotient of _ two _ separate averages be computed to find the temperature associated with a particular cartesian degree of freedom , @xmath56 _ kinetic _ temperature is simpler , requiring only a single average because @xmath57 is constant : @xmath58 unlike the kinetic temperature the configurational temperature is nonlocal ( through its dependence on forces ) .    it should be noted that the `` langevin thermometer '' , as implemented by hatano and jou@xcite , _ appears _ to be based on a similar application of kinetic theory .",
    "but the langevin thermometer , if viewed as a `` thermostat '' designed to impose the temperature @xmath14 suffers from the defect that its `` temperature '' ( given by the ratio of the time - integrated correlation function of the fluctuating force to the drag coefficient ) is _ not _ equal to @xmath59 ( or to any other oscillator - based temperature ) except _ at _ equilibrium .",
    "the ideal - gas thermometer , on the other hand , maintains its temperature both at and away from equilibrium , and can easily be implemented in numerical simulations by using either gaussian ( constant kinetic energy ) or nos - hoover ( specified time - averaged kinetic energy ) mechanics .",
    "both these thermostats employ feedback forces to maintain the specified kinetic temperature @xmath35 even away from equilibrium .",
    "baranyai s thermometer@xcite , with hundred of degrees of freedom , contains within it both stress and temperature gradients .",
    "his minicrystal thermometer translates , rotates and vibrates as well .",
    "this complexity destroys the local instantaneous nature of temperature that is so valuable for analyzing inhomogenous systems with large gradients .",
    "in order to explore the concept of nonequilibrium temperature jou suggested@xcite , and ultimately tested@xcite , the setup shown in fig .",
    "1 . as indicated in that figure , an equilibrium thermometer measures the `` real '' , or `` thermodynamic '' , or `` operational '' temperature @xmath60 when it is connected to a nonequilibrium system with a temperature intermediate to @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the constraint on individual particles velocities imposed by the heat current in the nonequilibrium system suggests that the nonequilibrium temperature @xmath60 will turn out to be lower than the local thermodynamic equilibrium temperature @xmath15 ( the temperature based on mass , momentum , and energy through the equilibrium equation of state)@xcite .",
    "`` extended irreversible thermodynamics''@xcite provides an estimate for this temperature difference : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the heat flux and the proportionality constant in this relation is a temperature - and - density - dependent material property . although hatano and jou@xcite confirmed that the kinetic temperature for a simple two - oscillator model actually _ is _ less than the temperature measured by a langevin thermometer , the configurational temperature for this same model behaved oppositely , _ exceeding _ the langevin temperature !",
    "this discrepancy led hatano and jou to conclude that the zeroth law of thermodynamics is unlikely to be obeyed away from equilibrium , once again shedding doubt on the existence of a nonequilibrium entropy .    in the present work we implement an extension of the hatano and jou simulation to a two - dimensional few - body system based on the @xmath27 model@xcite , as described in the following section .",
    "we consider a simple heat conducting nonequilibrium system in two space dimensions .",
    "see fig . 3 for a time exposure of the corresponding dynamics .",
    "there is a cold particle obeying the nos - hoover equations of motion : @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 both the cold particle and an analogous hot particle ( with @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) are connected to a newtonian particle with quadratic nearest - neighbor hookes - law bonds : @xmath70 see again fig .",
    "3 .    the newtonian particle through which the flux @xmath64 flows , from the hot particle to the cold one on the average , lies at the end of a chain of similar newtonian particles .",
    "this chain of newtonian particles acts as a _ thermometer _ through which no heat flows .    to validate the chain idea we carried out preliminary _ equilibrium _ simulations , with the `` hot '' and `` cold '' particles thermostated at a common temperature : @xmath71 .",
    "simulations with @xmath72 timesteps ( beginning after first discarding half a billion equilibration timesteps ) were carried out for seven- , fourteen- , and 21-particle systems .",
    "these three simulations each provided time - averaged configurational and kinetic temperatures for _ all _ particles lying in the range @xmath73 .",
    "these simulations indicated consistent equilibration along the chains and between the configurational and kinetic temperatures within a reasonable tolerance , @xmath74 .",
    "we conclude from these equilibration runs that the @xmath27 model is a sufficiently mixing and conducting system for use in _ nonequilibrium _ thermometry simulations .",
    "this convincing equilibration suggests that a _ chain _ of @xmath0 particles _ is _ a suitable thermometer .",
    "how long should the chain be away from equilibrium ? to find this out we next carried out an exactly similar series of three _ nonequilibrium _ simulations with an extreme factor - of-19 difference between the constrained cold and hot kinetic temperatures , @xmath75 the long - time - averaged temperature results for seven- , fourteen- , and 21-particle systems , shown in fig .",
    "4 , are essentially the same , so that a simple four - particle chain of thermometric particles is sufficient .",
    "each of the particles in this nonequilibrium system is tethered to its lattice site @xmath76 with a quartic potential : @xmath77 with seven particles there are sixteen ordinary differential equations to solve ( seven coordinates , seven momenta , and two friction coefficients ) . for convenience",
    "we choose all of the particle masses , boltzmann s constant @xmath78 , the force constants @xmath79 and @xmath80 , the hookes - law equilibrium spacing @xmath81 , and the cold and hot proportionality constants determining the nos - hoover friction coefficients , all equal to unity .",
    "for the cold particle we solve the following equations : @xmath82 @xmath66 @xmath83 we have carried out many other simulations , using configurational or one configurational and one kinetic thermostat , as well as different particle numbers , but the results are qualitatively similar to those obtained with kinetic thermostats and are therefore not reported here .",
    "likewise we do not explicitly consider here the possibility of separately thermostating the @xmath84 and @xmath85 directions ( by using two friction coefficients , @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) .",
    "it should be noted that the hookes - law nearest - neighbor potential leads to _ discontinuous forces _ whenever particle trajectories _ cross _ one another .",
    "this is a common occurence in either one or two dimensions , at sufficiently high temperatures . in one or two dimensions the force changes from @xmath88 to @xmath89 as two particles pass through one another . to avoid ( or at least minimize ) these discontinuities in the present two - dimensional simulations we have only considered simuilations with average temperatures less than or equal to 0.1 .    in discussing the applicability of irreversible thermodynamics to nonequilibrium systems",
    "several workers have suggested the use of a `` local thermodynamic equilibrium '' temperature@xcite . for the present model",
    "the relation between the local thermodynamic equilibrium temperature and the kinetic temperature is nearly linear .",
    "figure 5 shows the variation of kinetic energy with internal energy for a periodic chain of 100 particles ( results for seven- and fourteen - particle chains are essentially the same ) . to an accuracy better than a percent @xmath90",
    "exploratory simulations of the type illustrated in figs .",
    "3 and 4 suggested that the kinetic and configurational temperatures are a bit different ( away from equilibrium ) and also that these temperatures vary slightly along the length of the newtonian thermometric chain . at the same time",
    "the heat flow between the hot and cold particles closely follows fourier s law . to show this explicitly table i gives the kinetic and configurational temperatures for an average temperature , @xmath91 and a broad range of temperature differences , @xmath92 .",
    "the tabulated results for temperature differences which are not too large , @xmath93 show a relatively small variation of the effective thermal conductivity for the three - particle ( cold - newton - hot ) system , @xmath94 with the imposed temperature gradient .",
    "there are significant differences between the ( local ) kinetic and ( nonlocal ) configurational temperatures of the two thermostated particles .",
    "similarly , the kinetic and configurational temperatures of the newtonian particle linking them also differ somewhat . on the other hand ,",
    "the near proportionality of the internal energy and the kinetic energy _ at equilibrium _ implies that local - thermodynamic - equilibrium temperature profiles and kinetic - temperature profiles are essentially the same .    in every case",
    "the difference between the temperature of the newtonian particle _ with _ a heat flux ( particle 1 ) and the temperatures of the thermometric newtonian particles without a heat flux ( particles 2 ... 5 ) is rather small , but significant .",
    "this difference is explored systematically in table ii , where a relatively large kinetic temperature difference , @xmath95 is imposed .",
    "symmetry suggests that the temperature difference should depend quadratically on the heat flux ( this same dependence is also predicted by `` extended irreversible thermodynamics''@xcite ) .",
    "these simple arguments are wrong .",
    "in fact , the data in table ii suggest a square - root rather than a quadratic dependence .",
    "figure 6 shows the dependence of the temperature differences @xmath96 and @xmath97 on the heat flux @xmath64 .    the data in both tables , calculated with all the hookes - law force constants equal to unity , are consistent with the set of _ nonequilibrium _ inequalities : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the thermometric temperature of the newtonian thermometer while @xmath13 and @xmath35 are the configurational and kinetic temperatures of the newtonian particle through which heat flows .",
    "on the other hand , simply reducing the force constant ( from 1.0 to 0.3 ) linking that newtonian particle to the thermometric chain ( and leaving all the other force constants unchanged ) gives _ different _ inequalities : @xmath100 whether or not the conducting newtonian particle is `` hotter '' or `` colder '' than the thermometric chain depends on the definition of temperature _ at _ that particle ! the anistropicity of the newtonian particle s temperature is relatively small in these simulations , and tends to decrease as the force constant linking that particle to the thermometric chain is decreased .",
    "for instance , @xmath101 is reduced from 0.012 to 0.006 as the linking force constant is reduced from 1.0 to 0.1 .",
    "the sign of this disparity , @xmath102 , is nicely consistent with the intuitive reasoning of jou and casas - vsquez@xcite .",
    "evidently the predictions of extended irreversible thermodynamics are not particularly useful in understanding the temperature differences which result from small - system thermometry with relatively large thermal gradients .",
    "the detailed results depend upon the details of the thermometric linkage .",
    "note that the configurational temperature of the hot / cold thermostated particle lies _ below / above _ the kinetic temperature , a symptom of the configurational temperatures nonlocality .",
    "because the _ sign _ of @xmath103 can vary , both mechanical and thermodynamical effects are involved .    in order to show that the qualitative features of thermometry for the @xmath0 model are insensitive to temperature , we collect typical results in table ii for sets of cold and hot temperatures varying over two orders of magnitude . in each case",
    "the kinetic temperatures of the cold and hot particles are imposed by nos - hoover thermostats",
    ". then the long - time - averaged temperatures , both kinetic and configurational , are measured for all of the particles .",
    "the averaged heat flux is included too .",
    "the configurational temperature of the `` cold '' particle is uniformly higher than its kinetic temperature , while the configurational temperature of the `` hot '' particle is uniformly lower .",
    "this complexity is due to the nonlocal character of configurational temperature .    in summary ,",
    "let us reiterate our findings .",
    "first , numerical kinetic theory simulations ( fig .",
    "2 ) demonstrate the local instantaneous dynamical basis of kinetic temperature .",
    "next , stationary heat flows demonstrate an insensitivity of the nonequilibrium temperature to system size ( fig .",
    "4 ) and also show that the kinetic and configurational temperature shifts away from equilibrium can differ by more than a factor of two .",
    "this disparity occurs despite the near equivalence ( fig .",
    "5 ) of the kinetic temperature to the local - thermodynamic equilibrium temperature .",
    "though it is possible to imagine and compute many `` temperatures '' away from equilibrium , none of which satisfies a zeroth law , we see no reason to prefer any definition more complicated than that of the ideal - gas thermometer .",
    "a mechanical , local , and instantaneous physical thermometer ( which also corresponds well to a local thermodynamic equilibrium thermometer in the present case ) is appealing .",
    "it is the simplest choice .",
    "a particularly interesting problem where locality is important for nonequilibrium thermometry is the stationary shockwave .",
    "there the differences between the longitudinal and transverse kinetic temperatures are extremely large ( as measured by an ideal - gas thermometer ) and the relaxation times are determined by the atomic vibration frequency rather than diffusive processes@xcite .",
    "the extreme spatial gradients associated with strong shockwaves make the smoothing associated with configurational temperature undesirable .",
