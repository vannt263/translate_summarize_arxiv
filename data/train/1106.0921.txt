    "letting @xmath0 be either the real or complex field , the _ synthesis operator _ of a sequence of vectors @xmath1 in an @xmath2-dimensional hilbert space @xmath3 over @xmath0 is @xmath4 , @xmath5 . viewing @xmath3 as @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the @xmath8 matrix whose columns are the @xmath9 s .",
    "note that here and throughout , we make no notational distinction between the vectors themselves and the synthesis operator they induce .",
    "the vectors @xmath7 are said to be a _ frame _ for @xmath3 if there exists _ frame bounds _",
    "@xmath10 such that @xmath11 for all @xmath12 . in this finite - dimensional",
    "setting , the optimal frame bounds @xmath13 and @xmath14 of an arbitrary @xmath7 are the least and greatest eigenvalues of the _ frame operator _ : @xmath15 respectively . here , @xmath16 is the linear functional @xmath17 , @xmath18 . in particular , we have that @xmath7 is a frame if and only if the @xmath9 s span @xmath3 , which necessitates @xmath19 .",
    "frames provide numerically stable methods for finding overcomplete decompositions of vectors , and as such are useful tools in various signal processing applications  @xcite .",
    "indeed , if @xmath7 is a frame , then any @xmath12 can be decomposed as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a _ dual frame _ of @xmath7 , meaning it satisfies @xmath22 .",
    "the most often - used dual frame is the _",
    "canonical _ dual , namely the pseudoinverse @xmath23 .",
    "note that computing a canonical dual involves the inversion of the frame operator .",
    "as such , when designing a frame for a given application , it is important to retain control over the spectrum @xmath24 of @xmath25 . here and throughout , such spectra are arranged in nonincreasing order , with the optimal frame bounds @xmath13 and @xmath14 being @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .    of particular interest",
    "are _ tight frames _ , namely frames for which @xmath28 .",
    "note this occurs precisely when @xmath29 for all @xmath30 , meaning @xmath31 . in this case , the canonical dual is given by @xmath32 , and   becomes an overcomplete generalization of an orthonormal basis decomposition .",
    "tight frames are not hard to construct : we simply need the rows of @xmath7 to be orthogonal and have constant squared norm @xmath13 .",
    "however , this problem becomes significantly more difficult if we further require the @xmath9s  the columns of @xmath7to have prescribed lengths .",
    "in particular , much attention has been paid to the problem of constructing _ unit norm tight frames _ ( untfs ) : tight frames for which @xmath33 for all @xmath34 . here , since @xmath35 , we see that @xmath13 is necessarily @xmath36 .",
    "untfs are known to be optimally robust with respect to additive noise  @xcite and erasures @xcite .",
    "moreover , all unit norm sequences @xmath7 satisfy the zeroth - order _ welch bound _ , which is achieved precisely when @xmath7 is a untf  @xcite ; a physics - inspired interpretation of this fact leading to an optimization - based proof of existence of untfs is given in  @xcite .",
    "we further know that such frames are commonplace : when @xmath37 , the manifold of all @xmath8 real untfs , modulo rotations , is known to have dimension @xmath38  @xcite .",
    "essentially , when @xmath39 , this manifold is zero - dimensional since the only untfs are regular simplices  @xcite ; each additional unit norm vector injects @xmath40 additional degrees of freedom into this manifold , in accordance with the dimension of the unit sphere in @xmath41 .",
    "local parametrizations of this manifold are given in  @xcite .",
    "the _ paulsen problem _ involves projecting a given frame onto this manifold , and differential calculus - based methods for doing so are given in  @xcite .    in light of these facts , it is surprising to note how few explicit constructions of untfs are known .",
    "indeed , a constructive characterization of all untfs is only known for @xmath42  @xcite . for arbitrary @xmath2 and @xmath43",
    ", there are only two known general construction techniques : truncations of discrete fourier transform matrices known as _ harmonic frames _",
    "@xcite and a sparse construction method dubbed _ spectral tetris _  @xcite . to emphasize this point",
    ", we note that there are only a small finite number of known constructions of @xmath44 untfs , despite the fact that an infinite number of such frames exist even modulo rotations , their manifold being of dimension @xmath45 .",
    "the reason for this is that in order to construct a untf , one must solve a large system of quadratic equations in many variables : the columns of @xmath7 must have unit norm , and the rows of @xmath7 must be orthogonal with constant norm .    in this paper , we show how to explicitly construct all untfs , and moreover , how to explicitly construct every frame whose frame operator has a given arbitrary spectrum and whose vectors are of given arbitrary lengths .",
    "to do so , we build on the existing theory of majorization and the schur - horn theorem .",
    "to be precise , given two nonnegative nonincreasing sequences @xmath46 and @xmath47 , we say that @xmath46 _ majorizes _ @xmath47 , denoted @xmath48 , if @xmath49 viewed as discrete functions over the axis @xmath50 , having @xmath46 majorize @xmath47 means that the total area under both curves is equal , and that the area under @xmath46 is distributed more to the left than that of @xmath47 .",
    "a classical result of schur  @xcite states that the spectrum of a self - adjoint positive semidefinite matrix necessarily majorizes its diagonal entries .",
    "a few decades later , horn gave a nonconstructive proof of a converse result  @xcite , showing that if @xmath48 , then there exists a self - adjoint matrix that has @xmath46 as its spectrum and @xmath47 as its diagonal .",
    "these two results are collectively known as the schur - horn theorem :    there exists a positive semidefinite self - adjoint matrix with spectrum @xmath51 and diagonal entries @xmath47",
    "if and only if @xmath48 .    over the years , several methods for explicitly constructing horn s matrices have been found ; see  @xcite for a nice overview .",
    "many current methods rely on givens rotations  @xcite , while others involve optimization  @xcite . with regards to frame theory ,",
    "the significance of the schur - horn theorem is that it completely characterizes whether or not there exists a frame whose frame operator has a given spectrum and whose vectors have given lengths ; this follows from applying it to the _ gram matrix _ @xmath52 , whose diagonal entries are the values @xmath53 and whose spectrum @xmath51 is a zero - padded version of the spectrum @xmath24 of the frame operator @xmath25 .",
    "indeed , majorization inequalities arose during the search for tight frames with given lengths  @xcite , and the explicit connection between frames and the schur - horn theorem is noted in @xcite .",
    "this connection was then exploited to solve various frame theory problems , such as frame completion  @xcite .    in this paper , we follow the approach of  @xcite in which majorization is viewed as the end result of the repeated application of a more basic idea : eigenvalue interlacing . to be precise , a nonnegative nonincreasing sequence @xmath54 _ interlaces _ on another such sequence @xmath55 , denoted @xmath56 , provided @xmath57 under the convention @xmath58 , we have that @xmath56 if and only if @xmath59 for all @xmath60 .",
    "interlacing arises in the context of frame theory by considering partial sums of the frame operator  .",
    "to be precise , given any sequence of vectors @xmath61 in @xmath3 , then for every @xmath62 , we consider the partial sequence of vectors @xmath63 .",
    "note that @xmath64 and the frame operator of @xmath65 is @xmath66 let @xmath67 denote the spectrum of  . for any @xmath68 ,",
    "gives that @xmath69 and so a classical result  @xcite involving the addition of rank - one positive operators gives that @xmath70 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath71 for all @xmath62 , then for any such @xmath34 , @xmath72 note that as @xmath34 increases , the gram matrix grows in dimension but the frame operator does not since @xmath73 but @xmath74 .",
    "we call a sequence of interlacing spectra that satisfy   a sequence of _ eigensteps _ :    [ definition.eigensteps ] given nonnegative nonincreasing sequences @xmath24 and @xmath47 , a sequence of _ eigensteps _ is a doubly - indexed sequence of sequences @xmath75 for which :    1 .",
    "the initial sequence is trivial : @xmath76 2 .",
    "the final sequence is @xmath24 : @xmath77 3 .",
    "the sequences interlace : @xmath78 4 .",
    "the trace condition is satisfied : @xmath79    as we have just discussed , every sequence of vectors whose frame operator has the spectrum @xmath80 and whose vectors have squared lengths @xmath47 generates a sequence of eigensteps . in the next section",
    ", we adapt a proof technique of  @xcite to show the converse is true .",
    "specifically , theorem  [ theorem.necessity and sufficiency of eigensteps ] characterizes and proves the existence of sequences of vectors that generate a given sequence of eigensteps . in section  3",
    ", we then use this characterization to provide an algorithm for explicitly constructing all such sequences of vectors ; see theorem  [ theorem.explicit frame construction ] . though nontrivial , this algorithm is nevertheless straightforward enough to be implemented by hand in small - dimensional examples , involving only arithmetic , square roots and matrix multiplication .",
    "we will see that once the eigensteps have been chosen , the algorithm gives little freedom in picking the frame vectors themselves .",
    "that is , modulo rotations , the eigensteps are the free parameters when designing a frame whose frame operator has a given spectrum and whose vectors have given lengths .",
    "the significance of these methods is that they explicitly construct every possible finite frame of a given spectrum and set of lengths .",
    "computing the gram matrices of such frames produces every possible matrix that satisfies the schur - horn theorem ; previous methods have only constructed a subset of such matrices .",
    "moreover , in the special case where the spectrums and lengths are constant , these methods construct every equal norm tight frame .",
    "this helps narrow the search for frames we want for applications : tight gabor , wavelet , equiangular and grassmannian frames .",
    "the purpose of this section is to prove the following result :    [ theorem.necessity and sufficiency of eigensteps ] for any nonnegative nonincreasing sequences @xmath24 and @xmath47 , every sequence of vectors @xmath61 in @xmath3 whose frame operator @xmath25 has spectrum @xmath24 and which satisfies @xmath71 for all @xmath34 can be constructed by the following process :    1 .",
    "pick eigensteps @xmath75 as in definition  [ definition.eigensteps ] .",

    "the limit in   exists and is nonpositive .",
    "conversely , any @xmath7 constructed by this process has @xmath24 as the spectrum of @xmath25 and @xmath71 for all @xmath34 .",
    "moreover , for any @xmath7 constructed in this manner , the spectrum of @xmath89 is @xmath67 for all @xmath62 .",
    "we note that as it stands , theorem  [ theorem.necessity and sufficiency of eigensteps ] is not an easily - implementable algorithm , as step  a requires one to select a valid sequence of eigensteps  not an obvious feat  while step  b requires one to compute orthonormal eigenbases for each @xmath91 .",
    "these concerns will be addressed in the following section .",
    "we further note that theorem  [ theorem.necessity and sufficiency of eigensteps ] only claims to construct all possible such @xmath7 , sidestepping the issue of whether such an @xmath7 actually exists for a given @xmath24 and @xmath47 .",
    "this issue is completely resolved by the schur - horn theorem .",

    "we first obtain some supporting results .",
