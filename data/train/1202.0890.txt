    "ever since the theoretical prediction of the spin transfer torque ( stt ) @xcite , there has been much research effort in utilizing the stt phenomenon to induce magnetization switching and precession in ferromagnetic ( fm ) nanostructures without the need for an externally applied magnetic field .",
    "devices which rely on the stt effect for magnetization switching offer the advantages of lower power consumption and reduced device dimension , which are crucial factors for nanoscale and high - density spintronic applications .",
    "the stt effect has been studied in conventional magnetic nanostructures such as spin valves @xcite and magnetic tunneling junctions @xcite . for stt to occur in these magnetic multilayers ,",
    "one requires a pair of fm layers , i.e. , a reference spin layer to generate a spin - polarized current for injection into the second free ( switchable ) layer .",
    "the two layers are magnetized in a noncollinear configuration so as to induce the transfer of the transverse spin momentum from the reference to the free layer , which is mediated by conduction electrons flowing between the two layers . in the above process , the role of the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) effect is neglected .",
    "however , it is well - established that soc can generate a nonequilibrium spin accumulation under the passage of current .",
    "thus , it is conceivable that , in the presence of strong soc effect , one can induce a stt without the need for an additional reference fm layer .",
    "this is corroborated by previous theoretical work which showed that the presence of rashba spin - orbit coupling ( rsoc ) whose strength is denoted by @xmath4 , and exchange interaction @xmath5 between conduction electrons and local spins , can give rise to domain wall motion via spin momentum transfer @xcite . the same spin transfer mechanism can also occur in a fm layer with a large @xmath4 and @xmath5 values @xcite .",
    "the predicted rsoc - induced spin momentum transfer was experimentally demonstrated in a nanowire array @xcite .",
    "the above findings suggest that by utilizing rashba - induced stt , one can achieve magnetization switching within a single fm layer , without an additional non - collinear fm layer .",
    "such _ single layer switching _ holds several potential advantages over conventional stt devices , such as a more symmetric current switching profile and the reduced influence of spin depolarization at the interfaces .",
    "+ a key element which determines the feasibility of rashba stt is the presence of a strong rashba soc in the fm metal layer .",
    "initial studies on the rashba effect were focused on semiconductor ( sc ) materials @xcite , especially in two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) heterojunction structures , which consist of two sc layers with different energy bandgaps .",
    "the conduction electrons in the 2deg experience a strong rsoc effect due to the large potential gradient , as a result of the band - bending at the heterojunction interface .",
    "however , utilizing the rashba - induced stt in sc materials is not an attractive proposition as scs are intrinsically non - magnetic .",
    "even if ferromagnetic behavior can be induced in them via doping ( e.g. in dilute magnetic semiconductors or dms ) , the resulting curie temperature lies well below room temperature .",
    "recent studies have shown , however , that a strong rsoc effect can also be induced in metallic nanostructures , both of the fm and non - fm types @xcite .",
    "it is known that the rashba soc requires a structural inversion asymmetry ( sia ) , which gives rise to an internal electric field . in a metallic fm layer ,",
    "the sia can be enhanced by adjacent layers of heavy metals and oxides , which create the requisite band structure mismatch and large potential gradient at the interfaces @xcite . by engineering the interfaces of the metallic fm layer",
    ", one can control the strength of the rsoc effect within the layer .",
    "the ability to enhance the rsoc coupling via interfacial effects has led to the experimental demonstration of the effect of rashba - induced stt , as mentioned previously @xcite . however , to effectively harness this effect in future magnetic memory applications , it is essential to have an understanding of the microscopic spin transport in the presence of the rsoc effect , and the resulting non - equilibrium spatial distribution of the rashba - induced stt .",
    "+ thus , in this paper , we apply the keldysh nonequilibrium green s function ( negf ) technique to study the spin torque generated by the rashba soc on the local magnetization in a metallic fm layer .",
    "the negf method is suitable for the study of the rashba stt , which is essentially driven by nonequilibrium spin accumulation generated by the passage of current in the presence of rsoc .",
    "in addition , the negf method can systematically incorporate the effects of the leads , and interactions ( rsoc and exchange coupling ) as self - energy terms . in section",
    "ii of the paper , we introduce the system hamiltonian , consisting of the rashba term @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a unit vector parallel to the internal electric field @xmath10 , which acts perpendicular to the fm layer , @xmath11 is the electron wavevector and @xmath4 is the rsoc strength .",
    "the hamiltonian also includes the _ s - d _ interaction characterized by the exchange energy @xmath5 , which couples the nonequilibrium spin density due to rsoc effect to the local moments .",
    "based on the second - quantized form of the hamiltonian , we apply the tight - binding negf formalism , and calculate various microscopic transport quantities in the system , such as the local spin current and spin density , and the overall spin torque generated . in section iii , we numerically investigate ( i ) the spin torque efficiency as a function of the strengths of the rsoc effect @xmath12 , and the @xmath0-@xmath1 exchange interaction ( @xmath5 ) , ( ii ) the relationship between the spin torque distribution and the local spin currents , and ( iii ) the in - plane spin hall effect arising from rsoc .",

    "when the rashba coupling strength @xmath4 is increased , the magnitude of @xmath73 is generally larger since it scales with @xmath4 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2c ] .",

    "[ fig:4e ] ] .",
    "this may be explained by noting that a large rsoc strength increases the rate of spin precession .",
    "thus , the in - plane spin density @xmath117 oscillates and changes signs along the direction of electron propagation ( @xmath16-direction ) , as can be seen in fig .",

    "the spin transport through the system is modeled via the tight - binding non - equilibrum green s function ( negf ) formalism .",
    "the negf theory systematically incorporates many - body effects including interactions with the leads as self - energy terms , and enables current and spin density to be evaluated spatially under nonequilibrium ( bias - driven ) conditions .",
    "based on the negf theory , we numerically evaluate various transport parameters of the system , such as the effective field @xmath17 due to the spin torque , and the spatial distribution of the non - equilibrium spin current and spin accumulation .",
    "we found that @xmath17 generally increases with both the rsoc strength @xmath4 and the exchange coupling @xmath5 .",
    "however , the dependence of @xmath17 on both parameters is not totally linear , unlike previous predictions based on gauge formulation or semiclassical boltzmann which are global and only partially non - equilibrium ( linear response ) , and in the strong coupling limits . for practical values of @xmath5 and @xmath4 ,",
    "the calculated critical current density corresponding to a typical switching field of 200 mt is calculated to be lower than @xmath6 a/@xmath7 , comparable to that obtained via the conventional slonczewski spin torque . for the structure under consideration where net current is in the @xmath16-direction and the local moments are aligned in the vertical @xmath14-direction , the net effective field ( spin torque ) is in the @xmath79 ( @xmath16)-direction .",

    "it is also observed that the rashba torque @xmath73 is concentrated near the boundaries of the fm layer .",
    "we also found that the combined presence of rsoc effect and exchange coupling @xmath5 induces a hall separation of in - plane spins , whereas the spin hall effect for out - of - plane spins disappear with the introduction of @xmath5 .",
