    "the _ initial ( nucleation ) stage _ of a first - order phase transition , during which the precursors of the new phase appear as a result of random density fluctuations , still remains a challenging problem in the field of condensed matter . throughout the last century , numerous theoretical models have been developed with the aim of describing such phenomenon .",
    "these can be grouped in two categories depending on how the energy needed to form a molecular aggregate is derived : _",
    "i ) _ the _ cluster approach _ , originally introduced by the pioneers of the nucleation theory @xcite ; and _ ii ) _ the _ density - functional approach _ ( dfa ) , which was applied to nucleation first by cahn and hilliard.@xcite    in the cluster approach , phase transition is modelled by the formation of unstable molecular aggregates ( clusters ) whose density is close to that of the new stable phase .",
    "this argument is the cornerstone of both the equilibrium and the kinetic view of nucleation ; both of them consider that the aggregation of molecules requires energy , which is known as work for cluster formation @xmath0 , and such magnitude can be calculated in terms of the gibbs free energy ( e.g. chapter 3 of @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "the mathematical expression for the work of cluster formation is very simple in the case of spherical clusters since the surface tension can be approximated by the one known between the phases involved in the process ( e.g. vapor - liquid , liquid - solid ) and does not depend on cluster size . such approximation is also called _ capillary approximation_. in the classical nucleation theory ( cnt ) the work of cluster formation plays a prominent role because the equilibrium cluster size distribution is of boltzmann type , i.e. it is exponentially proportional to the work of formation , and satisfies the law of mass action .",
    "one of the main problems of this theory is that the pre - exponential factor depends on the concentration of potential nucleation sites , an obscure parameter which can not be determined precisely .",
    "although cnt is easily comprehensible , in many cases it does not accurately predict the nucleation rate.@xcite in the case of kinetic nucleation theory ( knt ) the pre - exponential factor is derived in terms of the monomer attachment and detachment rates.@xcite although the expression for the collision frequency is readily obtainable , the same is not true with the monomer desorption rate .",
    "the work of cluster formation enters in knt via the detailed - balance condition imposed to eliminate the dependency on this unknown quantity . considering this assumption",
    "one obtains a fokker - planck equation ( fpe ) as the time - evolution equation of the cluster size concentration , better known as the zeldovich - frenkel equation ( e.g. chapter 9 of @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "hence , the equilibrium cluster size distribution can be re - written in terms of the work of formation and the monomer attachment rate yielding the kinetic counterpart of the classical equation . in this framework ,",
    "the estimated values for nucleation rate are also far from those obtained experimentally .",
    "these deviations led to the development of new theories such as the density functional approach .    under dfa",
    ", the state of the system is described by the number density of molecules as a function of the space coordinates , @xmath1 .",
    "no explicit boundary between the phases of higher and lower density is assumed and , hence , it can not accurately be established whether a molecule belongs to the old or the new phase .",
    "this is also known as the diffuse interface theory of nucleation . in this regard ,",
    "the work of cluster formation is now expressed in terms of the landau potential which can be calculated by using , for example , the square - gradient approximation@xcite and used as a replacement of @xmath0 in cnt and knt master equations .",
    "until recently , the above descriptions of nucleation have been the main tools to predict experimental results .",
    "notwithstanding , the underlying mathematical treatment in these theories is completely deterministic , though they describe a random process . for this reason",
    "a new formulation for the nucleation theory has been developed within the statistical mechanics framework.@xcite however , this formalism can not be used in the case of non - stationary conditions and , furthermore , it does not fit to the observed values of ( nucleation ) induction time.@xcite the main motivation of this paper is to overcome both limitations , i.e. the deterministic nature of previous models and the lack of solutions for non - stationary conditions .      in the middle of the twentieth century , hendrik anthony",
    "kramers described thermally activated escape from a metastable state as _ brownian motion _ of a fictitious particle along a _",
    "reaction coordinate _ , which covers all relevant degrees of freedom that define the system state , in a ( static ) field of force.@xcite such processes are characterized by the presence of two stable states separated by a potential barrier and can be described in two different but equivalent forms .",
    "the first is using stochastic differential equations ( sde ) to characterize the time evolution of the reaction coordinate .",
    "the conjectured sde is a langevin - like equation@xcite which contains both a deterministic and a random part .",
    "the second is using the time - evolution equation of the probability density function ( pdf ) associated with the reaction coordinate .",
    "indeed , this expression can be written as a fokker - planck equation.@xcite thus , as we will demonstrate later , using the fpe one can derive an analytical expression for the nucleation ( or escape ) rate in the form proposed by arrhenius . moreover , considering the nucleation process as a rare event one can obtain the pdf for the induction time .",
    "hence , the proposed model not only allows to reduce the problem from a @xmath2-dimensional to an unidimensional description but also provides analytical expressions for magnitudes such as nucleation rate under both stationary and non - stationary conditions , which demonstrates the abilities of the model .",
    "the aim of this work is to apply kramers reasoning to the problem of nucleation in order to predict the induction time statistics for both stationary and non - stationary conditions , the latter assuming the semiadiabatic limit.@xcite we propose cluster radius , @xmath3 , as a reaction coordinate for crystal nucleation and , hence , a stochastic differential equation is postulated for modeling time evolution of the cluster size . in this context , analytical expressions for statistics of induction time can be deduced by employing the theory of stochastic processes .",
    "this contribution allows us to better understand the randomness of experimental results and the deviation from the theoretical ( classical ) nucleation rate .",
    "the energy required to form ( so - called work of formation of ) a spherical cluster with the properties of the new phase within a supersaturated mother phase has been extensively studied.@xcite although historically the usual convention has been to evaluate the work of cluster formation in terms of the increment of the gibbs free energy , such a magnitude has to be evaluated depending on the system in terms of the corresponding thermodynamic potential .",
    "thus , if one considers homogeneous nucleation in the context of the grand canonical ensemble , the work of formation will be given in terms of the landau potential , @xmath4 .",
    "nevertheless one can consider the problem in a closed system and , then , one has to evaluate this energy in terms of the helmholtz free energy , @xmath5 . in any case ,",
    "gibbs interfacial thermodynamics can be used in order to derive the energetic cost of forming an spherical embryo of the stable phase inside the metastable mother phase , taking into account the capillary approximation .",
    "these calculations end up in expressions that contains a volume and a surface term .",
    "the former consists of a free energy density term multiplied by the volume of the sphere .",
    "the latter contains the surface of the sphere multiplied by a surface tension term which generally depends on the radius . nevertheless ,",
    "as has been shown , this dependence is weak and considering the surface free energy as a constant is a very good approximation .",
    "however , computing the free energy density inside the cluster is not a straightforward calculation neither in monocomponent nor in multicomponent systems.@xcite for the sake of simplicity , we will consider the approximation of such magnitude as the increment of the chemical potential@xcite , obtaining so the following expression for the reversible work required to form a noncritical cluster@xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the difference between the chemical potential of the liquid and that of the solid phase , @xmath8 is the volume occupied by a molecule in the cluster of the new phase and @xmath9 is the surface tension between the old and the new phase ( considering a planar interface ) . at small @xmath3 , the second term of equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) , which is related to the formation of the surface , prevails while the first term plays a decisive role at large values of @xmath3 .",
    "the maximum of @xmath10 defines the critical size , @xmath11 with @xmath12    as widely known , equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) characterizes the equilibrium state of the system whereas the cluster radius describes the dynamic of the nucleation process .",
    "the latter magnitude is generally strongly coupled with the environmental degrees of freedom and due to such a coupling its dynamic is not deterministic but stochastic .",
    "therefore , one can assume that @xmath3 plays the role of a reaction coordinate in the kramers theory.@xcite accordingly the variable cluster radius , hereafter denoted as @xmath13 , can be understood as a stochastic process , i.e. @xmath14 draws a random trajectory in the reduced phase space of the system ( figure [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "considering these assumptions , the nucleation process is characterized by a stochastic variable which can be interpreted as the instantaneous position of a _ fictitious brownian particle_. inspired by the kramers theory one postulates that the equation of motion for such a particle will be given by a langevin - type equation .",
    "in fact , nucleation is nothing but a thermally activated escape process from a potential barrier .",
    "therefore , in order to escape from the well @xmath15 , the fictitious `` random walker '' must acquire energy to overcome the energy barrier and subsequently it must again lose energy to become trapped by the attractor @xmath16 , i.e. a molecular cluster will fluctuate in size until escape from the well @xmath17 to the attractor @xmath18 after which the cluster will grow in a deterministic manner .      the stochastic dynamic of the cluster radius , @xmath13 , can be phenomenologically postulated by means of an _ overdamped _ _",
    "langevin _ _ equation _ , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the friction coefficient associated with the reduced phase space ( so - called _ reaction - coordinate viscosity _ ) and @xmath21 denotes zero - mean , delta - correlated gaussian white noise ( gwn ) , @xmath22 the main reason to consider the overdamped limit ( avoiding the second time derivative of @xmath13 ) is because it is consistent with the structure of the classical post - critical growth law . to demonstrate that we only have to consider @xmath23 , where the noise term is negligible in comparison to the driving force , so @xmath24 which shows the same structure as ( see eq .",
    "2.62 of @xcite@xcite ) @xmath25 with @xmath2 the number of molecules inside the cluster and @xmath26 the attachment rate .",
    "although inspired by the latter one may feel tented to consider a size - dependent viscosity , @xmath20 , we used a constant viscosity since it is in good agreement with the procedure followed in cnt to calculate nucleation rates setting @xmath26 to @xmath27 ( e.g. p.168 of @xcite@xcite ) , with the advantage that this simplifies the later calculations . in order to confirm that such a simplification is reasonably good , we can consider for example the case of diffusion - limited kinetics , where the monomer attachment rate is given by ( see eq .",
    "10.18 of @xcite@xcite ) @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the sticking coefficient , @xmath30 is the diffusion constant and @xmath31 is the monomer number density and where the only dependence on the size enters via the radius @xmath32 with @xmath33 . as can be observed in figure [ fig : r_n ] , which represents @xmath32 as a function of @xmath2 , the radius lies in the range @xmath34 $ ] for a very wide range of @xmath2 .",
    "thus , one can conclude that @xmath20 could be ultimately approximated as a constant to make easier the later mathematical treatment .",
    "in fact , as we will see later ( eq . [ eq:21-new ] ) , if one selects @xmath35 inspired by the previous reasoning , the nucleation rate derived from cnt is recovered except for a multiplicative factor .",
    "it is worth to note that the friction coefficient @xmath20 is an abstraction that provides information about the viscosity of the phase space , @xmath36 .",
    "hence , there is no trivial expression for @xmath37 in terms of the friction acting on individual molecules in the real space . nonetheless this magnitude can be estimated , together with the mass associated with the reaction coordinate @xmath38 , by using molecular dynamics.@xcite one can expect that the former will be related to the mean monomer attachment frequency for a @xmath3-sized spherical cluster @xmath39 since",
    ", the first term of the right hand side of equation ( [ eq:4 ] ) informs about the deterministic behaviour of the cluster size and the second one only can arise from the unpredictable collisions of monomers with the cluster .",
    "indeed , @xmath20 should be characterized by the thermodynamic properties of the new phase since at a fixed temperature the monomer attachment frequency depends on the density of the final state .",
    "thus the most remarkable characteristic of equation ( [ eq:4 ] ) , comparing with the ginzburg - landau equation ( e.g. chapter 4 of @xcite@xcite ) , is the second term on the right hand side which includes not only a random variable but also the temperature of the thermal bath .",
    "hence , this term plays the role of a fluctuating force which comprehends all degrees of freedom associated with the environment .",
    "therefore , the equation of motion of the fictitious brownian particle presents two contributions : _",
    "i ) _ the deterministic force due to the free energy potential @xmath40 , and _",
    "ii ) _ the random force .    from the stochastic differential equation ( [ eq:4 ] )",
    ", using the forward kramers - moyal expansion , it can be demonstrated that the time - evolution equation of the pdf , @xmath41 , is @xmath42 where the linear differential operator @xmath43 is the _ smoluchowski operator _ , @xmath44 a special form of the _ fokker - planck _",
    "operator @xmath45 @xcite , and @xmath46 is the probability current @xmath47 equation ( [ eq:6 ] ) is also known as the _ smoluchowski equation _ and belongs to the family of fokker - planck partial differential equations .",
    "it is noteworthy that the above fpe for the proposed continuous random walker should be considered as the continuous counterpart of that derived from a discrete brownian motion@xcite but setting the monomer attachment rate to be the mean monomer attachment frequency , which is directly related with @xmath20 by means of equation ( [ eq:20-new ] ) .",
    "the main advantage of having a continuous version of the pdf is that it allows us to use the tools of the continuous calculus to compute in an easy way magnitudes such as the mean first passage time without considering infinite series .",
    "moreover , as will be immediately studied , obtaining the stationary and quasi - stationary distribution functions will be almost straightforward owing to the rules of continuous integral calculus can be used .",
    "the time evolution of the pdf converges to the stationary solution of equation ( [ eq:6 ] ) when . with the aid of this solution it is possible to estimate the probability to find a cluster of a given size when the time is much larger than the relaxation time @xmath48",
    "this represents the time required to decay within the attractor @xmath17 @xmath49^{-1/2 } ,   \\label{eq:9}\\ ] ] with @xmath38 the effective mass corresponding to the fictitious particle .",
    "in such a case , i.e. when the time is larger than the time required for the spontaneous decomposition of a subcritical cluster , the non - stationary pdf converges to the stationary one @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the normalization constant ( see [ ap:1 ] ) @xmath52 the identity ( [ eq:10 ] ) is completely in accordance with the cluster size distribution of cnt@xcite with @xmath51 playing the role of the pre - exponential factor .    nevertheless , the stationary pdf is not useful to obtain the nucleation rate since the boundary condition @xmath53 implies that the probability current must be zero at @xmath54 , i.e. @xmath55 , and hence at any value of @xmath13 including @xmath56 .",
    "such restriction implies that the escape rate must be equal to zero due to the definition of this magnitude , @xmath57 with @xmath58 the stationary probability that the particle has not crossed the boundary @xmath59 , @xmath60 which is usually approximated by @xmath61 .",
    "this fact shows that the stationary distribution is a good but unrealistic approximation .",
    "for this reason we shall introduce the quasi - stationary solution of the smoluchowski equation .",
    "now we shall assume that @xmath62 and @xmath63 is constant .",
    "under these conditions , before reaching the stationary state ( i.e. @xmath64 ) the smoluchowski solution remains in a quasi - stationary state and , therefore , the current probability is almost time - independent . in such a quasi - stationary state ,",
    "the probability current over the top of the potential is very small near to @xmath56 and the time change of the pdf is also very small .",
    "therefore , the small value of the probability current is almost independent of @xmath13 , i.e. @xmath65 . hence , equation ( [ eq:8 ] ) can be written as @xmath66 considering now the boundary condition @xmath67 , one readily gets @xmath68",
    "we want to calculate the mean time that the system needs to produce a supercritical cluster , i.e. when @xmath69 . this magnitude is also called _",
    "mean first - passage time _ ( mfpt ) ( or kramers time ) and can be easily related to the induction time . in this section",
    "we present the expressions obtained for the induction time and the nucleation rate under both stationary and non - stationary conditions .      from equations ( [ eq:12],[eq:13],[eq:15 ] ) the following expression for the escape rate can be derived , @xmath70 accordingly , applying the laplace ( or gaussian steepest - descent ) method ( e.g. page 124 of cite @xcite@xcite ) the following approximation can be obtained ( see [ ap:2 ] ) @xmath71 the inverse of this escape rate is also known as mfpt , @xmath72 the nucleation rate and the induction time are given by the expressions@xcite @xmath73 where @xmath31 is the monomer number density , i.e. the equilibrium number of monomer per unit volume @xmath74 , and @xmath75 . as can be observed , equation ( [ eq:19 - 2 ] ) looks like the classical expression for the nucleation rate .",
    "indeed , it can be rewritten as , @xmath76 with @xmath77 being the number of molecules inside the @xmath3-sized cluster , the curvature of the energy landscape at the basin and the zeldovich s factor ( typically@xcite  @xmath78 ) , respectively .",
    "therefore , the term @xmath79 sets the time scale of the phase transition .",
    "in fact , following the classical reasoning ( that the characteristic time for nucleation is determined by the attachment rate of monomers to the critical cluster ) one could postulate that @xmath80 so that @xmath81 thus , substituting equation ( [ eq:20-new ] ) into ( [ eq:19-new ] ) one gets , @xmath82 therefore , making such an interpretation of the viscosity parameter , one recovers the cnt expression of the nucleation rate@xcite , @xmath83 . note that this expression of @xmath37 is slightly different from that one we expected , i.e. @xmath84 , inspired by the post - critical growth rate . in such a case",
    ", the nucleation rate would be @xmath85 which differs from the cnt expression in a multiplicative pre - exponential factor which is of the order of @xmath86 .",
    "nonetheless , in this work we propose a similar expression to ( [ eq:20-new ] ) but considering the average value of the collision rate that an individual cluster feels , i.e. @xmath39 .",
    "although this magnitude is completely unknown we can assert that it should be lower than @xmath87 .",
    "therefore , our proposed expression for the nucleation rate would be as , @xmath88 which should predict lower values than the classical one since , @xmath89 . nonetheless , under this assumption",
    "the nucleation rate depends on an unknown magnitude , @xmath39 .",
    "this is the reason by which @xmath20 must be fitted to experimental values for @xmath90 .",
    "actually , one could use the fitted value of @xmath20 in order to estimate the effective value of  @xmath39  and , then , better understand the kinetics of the phase transition . with the aid of such a value information on the underlying mechanism of cluster formation could be obtained by comparing with theoretical values obtained using the different expressions for the monomer attachment frequencies ( chapter 10 of cite @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "once an estimation for the induction time has been obtained , it seems interesting to derive an analytical equation for the induction time statistics which would be helpful for a better description of the random nature of such magnitude .",
    "thus , if nucleation is considered as a homogeneous poisson process@xcite characterized by the escape rate , @xmath91 , the induction time can be considered as a gamma - distributed random variable with a pdf given by @xmath92 so that , @xmath93 the latter equation is also called the kramers law of the escape time statistics . according to equation ( [ eq:18 ] ) , if we know the viscosity of the reduced phase space @xmath20 then the statistics of the nucleation process can be estimated from equation ( [ eq:20 ] ) .",
    "although equations ( [ eq:18 ] , [ eq:19 ] , [ eq:20 ] ) are good approximations , one can compare the accuracy of these expressions by numerical integration .",
    "as in the case of ordinary differential equations , there exists a huge number of techniques ( stochastic integrators , sint ) for integrating a sde as the _ euler - maruyama method_.@xcite in such a case , the upper limit of @xmath13 ( i.e. the absorbing wall @xmath94 ) must be fixed at a value greater than @xmath56 and obeying @xmath95      let us consider the case when the potential barrier @xmath96 changes over time ( e.g. due to changes in bulk concentration , temperature , ph , etc.@xcite ) but this change is slow compared to the relaxation time of the system @xmath48 . according to the reasoning of talkner and co - workers@xcite the system reaches a quasi - stationary state instantaneously ( semiadiabatic approximation ) and therefore an analogous deduction to the developed for equation ( [ eq:20 ] ) can be made for unsteady conditions of @xmath96 @xmath97 or equivalently , @xmath98 also called _ instantaneous escape rate_. proceeding in a similar manner to the previous section , one calculates the expression for the _ instantaneous nucleation rate _ and , hence , for the _ instantaneous induction time _ @xmath99    equation ( [ eq:22 ] ) constitutes a good approximation only when the topology of the potential barrier @xmath100 does not change , i.e. the character of its local maxima and minima must be invariant .",
    "in fact , talkner and co - workers @xcite derived a more accurate expression which contains expression ( [ eq:22 ] ) and a second - order correction term .",
    "they called the latter as _ geometric correction term _ because it is related to the geometric change of the barrier shape .",
    "we will not consider this second - order correction in this work .    following a similar procedure to that of the previous section , the nucleation process can be understood now as a non - homogeneous poisson process@xcite and , hence , the first - passage time statistics is governed by the equation below @xmath101 with @xmath102 and assuming @xmath103 accordingly , the distribution function of the induction time is given by @xmath104 the accuracy of our theoretical predictions is strongly related to the assumptions made above .",
    "consequently , the results predicted with the aid of equations ( [ eq:22 ] ) and ( [ eq:27 ] ) can be improved using a sint .",
    "in fact , the stochastic integration is indispensable in order to obtain more realistic predictions when the hypotheses of the semiadiabatic limit are not fulfilled .",
    "indeed , sints are the only tool to predict escape rates and , then , induction times under strongly unsteady conditions .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , the instantaneous position of the absorbing wall @xmath105 must be fixed at a value greater than @xmath106 and obeying the following relation @xmath107",
    "at this point , a short break should be taken in order to summarize and qualitatively analyze the theoretical results obtained so far , before making use of them in the next section .    thus far",
    "the presented model has shown the ability of reproducing the main theoretical results , such as the stationary size distribution , the nucleation rate or induction time equations , of cnt and another previous works in case of setting the viscosity parameter to be the monomer attachment rate of the critical cluster , as we discussed in section 2 .",
    "nevertheless , the major difference with previous theories is indeed that the brownian model does not consider this as the only possibility .",
    "in fact , we have emphasized that there is no apparent growth mechanism to be the same as that which governs the growth of post - critical clusters .",
    "although that could seem a disadvantage because the magnitudes mentioned above will depend on an _ a priori _ undetermined attachment frequency , it allows us to make better predictions by deducing such a parameter experimentally under conditions when the experiments are highly reproducible and , then , using that fitted value of viscosity , @xmath108 , into equations one can predict nucleation rates ( or induction times ) for different conditions , e.g. large values of supersaturation ratio .",
    "therefore , following this line of reasoning , the gap between the experimental and classical predictions can be overcome , as will be shown in the next section .    besides",
    ", another advantage of this heuristic model is to describe the randomness underlying the experiments in order to determine how reproducible they are .",
    "the induction times ineluctably have a standard deviation that can not be reproduced by the cnt procedures .",
    "however , the brownian model is based on a sde and hence , the stochasticity is considered .",
    "therefore , the present work endows the classical description with a mathematical apparatus which covers the inhere experimental deviations .",
    "that allows us to know whether or not the experimental values lie in the theoretically predicted statistics and , ultimately , knowing whether or not the experiments fulfill our predictions .    in order to highlight and verify these claims",
    ", we will compare the results computed by using the brownian model against those predicted by using cnt expression ( i.e. eq.([eq:21-new ] ) ) .",
    "yet more , the statistics will be tested showing a slight deviation from the experimental one , but this can be explained based on the finite number of assays .",
    "the brownian model proposed in sections 2 and 3 has been tested under fixed experimental conditions by fitting the viscosity parameter through the expression for the induction time ( [ eq : indtime ] ) to experimental results of such a magnitude measured for hydrated calcium sulphate caso@xmath1092h@xmath110o ( gypsum ) in a volume of @xmath111 .",
    "this kind of applications represents one of the main contributions of this paper because neither classical nor non - classical nucleation theories allow to follow a nucleation event in such a simple manner . as a summary",
    ", one must fit @xmath20 to experimental data using equation ( [ eq : indtime ] ) and apply both the sde ( eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) ) and equations ( [ eq:19 - 2]-[eq:20 ] , [ eq:24-new]-[eq:27 ] ) to predict both nucleation rates and induction time statistics under both steady and unsteady conditions .",
    "once we have the estimation of @xmath20 , one can apply equation ( [ eq:20 ] ) in order to calculate the induction time statistics and verify the ability to predict @xmath112 .",
    "moreover , with the aim of considering a finite number of assays the time evolution of the reaction coordinate @xmath13 was simulated using the euler - mauryama method .",
    "furthermore , using the fitted value of @xmath20 one could simulate more complicated experimental conditions where classical expressions can not be used .",
    "twelve assays measuring induction time were considered at a fixed supersaturation and temperature to estimate @xmath20 , e.g. @xmath113 and the solubility @xmath114 ) is used as a measure of the driving force for the phase change , @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 are the activity and the equilibrium activity of the solute , respectively .",
    "] at @xmath118 ( the point marked with an arrow in figure [ fig:4 ] ) , yielding the value @xmath119 .",
    "this value was computed by equaling equation ( [ eq : indtime ] ) to the experimental average value at this supersaturation , i.e. @xmath120 with @xmath121 in our case .    substituting the estimated value of @xmath122 into equation ( [ eq : indtime ] )",
    "one can calculate a theoretical curve of predicted induction times as a function of supersaturation .",
    "the predicted curves for induction times are in very good agreement with the measured values ( figure [ fig:4 ] ) . to carry out the calculation of these curves , as well as the classical predictions , we need to know the surface tension . in this work",
    "we used@xcite @xmath123 with @xmath124j / m@xmath125 the value estimated by @xcite@xcite for homogeneous nucleation ( hon ) in the same range of temperatures and , the contact angle @xmath126 , so that @xmath127 .",
    "this is often employed to model heterogeneous nucleation .    moreover , as can be observed in figure [ fig:4 ] , the ratio @xmath128 is of order @xmath129 which means the effective attachment rate is @xmath130 ( dividing eq .",
    "( [ eq:22-new ] ) by ( [ eq:21-new ] ) ) .",
    "hence , the methodology followed in cnt of approximating @xmath131 ( e.g. p.168 of @xcite@xcite ) to obtain @xmath83 lead to an overestimation of the nucleation rate by several orders of magnitudes .",
    "the model also provides the necessary tools for calculating the induction time statistics by considering the kramers law ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq:20 ] ) and ( [ eq:27 ] ) ) .",
    "the same set of twelve experimental values for induction time were used in order to calculate the experimental cumulative distribution function ( blue triangles in figure [ fig:5 ] ) . using the estimated value of @xmath122 into equation ( [ eq:20 ] ) , @xmath132 ( solid orange line in figure [ fig:5 ] )",
    "was obtained .",
    "as can be observed , the theoretical prediction does not fit as expected to the experimental statistics .",
    "such a disagreement between the predicted and the observed curves is not due to the assumptions made to integrate the escape rate but to the fact that in experiments we truncated the statistics to the longest time observed , @xmath133 , i.e. no nucleation events were recorded after an arbitrary time @xmath133 corresponding to the duration of the experiment .",
    "so the experimental @xmath90 values were biassed towards small values . using a sint ( euler - maruyama ) to simulate with equation ( [ eq:4 ] ) a finite number of assays with an upper limit equal to the experimental observation time ( i.e.",
    "if a simulation exceeds the upper limit @xmath134 , then such assay is not considered and another one starts ) the simulated results ( green squares in figure [ fig:5 ] ) are much closer to the experimental curve .",
    "in this work a stochastic differential equation was presented as the equation of motion of the classical order parameter in the classical nucleation theory , i.e. the cluster radius .",
    "this sde for modelling the time evolution of the radius of an individual cluster was used to obtain theoretical equations to predict ( nucleation ) induction times and its statistics .",
    "these equations are applicable to the often used crystallization setups in which supersaturation changes over time and can be used to identify the underlying mechanism of cluster formation by fitting the measured nucleation rates to equations ( [ eq:19-new])-([eq:20-new ] ) and ( [ eq:22-new ] ) , as well as to predict induction times ( eqs . ( [ eq : indtime ] ) and ( [ eq:24 - 2-new ] ) ) and induction time distributions ( eqs . ( [ eq:19])-([eq:20 ] ) and ( [ eq:24])-([eq:27 ] ) ) .",
    "we present here not only an application of the model but also a method to obtain theoretical and simulated predictions of both induction times ( and hence of nucleation rates ) and cumulative distribution functions at different concentrations and temperatures .",
    "the first test of the stochastic model against experimental data reveals its potential ability for calculating nucleation rates and induction time statistics .",
    "both the analytical and the numerical results predicted by the brownian model seems to be in good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "hence , the interpretation of the nucleation stage as an escape process could be an optimal tool to study deeper problems of the first - order phase transitions .",
    "however the theoretical approximations usually offers worse results than the simulations of the sde by using stochastic integrators due to the experimental truncation of the statistics to the longest time observed .",
    "additional work is in progress to deduce analytical expressions for nucleation rate , induction times and induction time distributions when neither stationary nor semiadiabatic limit can be considered .",

    "let us consider that @xmath135 is large and that @xmath136 is very small .",
    "therefore @xmath137 becomes very small for values of @xmath13 appreciably different from @xmath54 . in this case",
    "@xmath96 can be expanded according to taylor s theorem as @xmath138 and thus one gets the following approximation @xmath139 \\right\\}dx\\nonumber\\\\    & = e^{-{\\textcolor{black}}{w } ( 0)/k_bt}\\int_0^\\infty\\exp \\left\\ { -\\frac{1}{2k_bt}{\\textcolor{black}}{w } ' ' ( 0)x^2      \\right\\}dx\\nonumber\\\\    & = e^{-{\\textcolor{black}}{w } ( 0)/k_bt}\\left.\\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi k_bt}{2}}\\,\\text{erf}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{{\\textcolor{black}}{w } ' ' ( 0)}\\,x}{\\sqrt{2k_bt}}\\right)}{\\sqrt{{\\textcolor{black}}{w } ' ' ( 0)}}\\right|_{x=0}^{x=\\infty}\\nonumber\\\\    & = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi k_b t}{2}}\\frac{e^{-{\\textcolor{black}}{w } ( 0)/k_bt}}{\\sqrt{{\\textcolor{black}}{w } ' ' ( 0)}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath140 denoting the second derivative with respect the reaction coordinate @xmath141 .",

    "<S> in this work a phenomenological stochastic differential equation is proposed for modelling the time evolution of the radius of a pre - critical molecular cluster during nucleation ( the classical order parameter ) . </S>",
    "<S> such a stochastic differential equation constitutes the basis for the calculation of the ( nucleation ) induction time under kramers theory of thermally activated escape processes . </S>",
    "<S> considering the nucleation stage as a poisson rare - event , analytical expressions for the induction time statistics are deduced for both steady and unsteady conditions , the latter assuming the semiadiabatic limit . </S>",
    "<S> these expressions can be used to identify the underlying mechanism of molecular cluster formation ( distinguishing between homogeneous or heterogeneous nucleation from the nucleation statistics is possible ) as well as to predict induction times and induction time distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the predictions of this model are in good agreement with experimentally measured induction times at constant temperature , unlike the values obtained from the classical equation , but agreement is not so good for induction time statistics . </S>",
    "<S> stochastic simulations truncated to the maximum waiting time of the experiments confirm that this fact is due to the time constraints imposed by experiments . </S>",
    "<S> correcting for this effect , the experimental and predicted curves fit remarkably well . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the proposed model seems to be a versatile tool to predict cluster size distributions , nucleation rates , ( nucleation ) induction time and induction time statistics for a wide range of conditions ( e.g. time - dependent temperature , supersaturation , ph , etc . ) where classical nucleation theory is of limited applicability .    </S>",
