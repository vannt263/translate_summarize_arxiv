    "for example , if @xmath621 is a finitely presented torsion - free group with unsolvable word problem , then , by theorem [ thm : emb ] , @xmath621 can be embedded into a finitely presented torsion - free acylindrically hyperbolic group @xmath1 such that every hyperbolically embedded subgroup in @xmath1 is free of finite rank .",
    "yet another application is related to maximal elliptic subgroups ( a subgroup is _ elliptic _ if all of its orbits are bounded ) .",
    "recall that for every group @xmath1 acting acylindrically on a hyperbolic space , every elliptic subgroup of @xmath1 is contained in a maximal elliptic subgroup of @xmath1 , and maximal elliptic subgroups exhibit malnormality - type properties similar to hyperbolically embedded subgroups ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 1.6 ) ) .",
    "it is easy to show that if @xmath156 and @xmath60 is infinite , then @xmath60 is maximal elliptic with respect to the action of @xmath1 on the cayley graph @xmath138 .",
    "thus it is natural to ask whether maximal elliptic subgroups are hyperbolically embedded .",
    "the following corollary provides the negative answer . in what follows",
    "we say that a subgroup @xmath132 is _ absolutely elliptic _ if it is elliptic with respect to any acylindrical action of @xmath1 on a hyperbolic space .",
    "there exists a group @xmath198 and an absolutely elliptic subgroup @xmath1121 such that @xmath621 is not contained in any proper hyperbolically embedded subgroup of @xmath1 . in particular , for any non - elliptic acylindrical action of @xmath1 on a hyperbolic space , the maximal elliptic subgroup of @xmath1 containing @xmath621 is not hyperbolically embedded .",
    "let @xmath1122 and let @xmath1 be the group provided by theorem [ thm : emb ] .",
    "note that @xmath621 is absolutely elliptic by theorem [ class ] ( it is not acylindrically hyperbolic by theorem [ thm : elem - prop - ah ] ) . on the other hand , it can not be a subgroup of any proper hyperbolically embedded subgroup of @xmath1 by part ( b ) of theorem [ thm : emb ] .",
    "we showed that every one - relator group with at least @xmath0 generators and  most \" one - relator group with least @xmath13 generators are acylindrically hyperbolic . however the case of @xmath13-generator groups is far from being clear .",
    "the next two questions are motivated by our results about the integral @xmath13-dimensional cremona group @xmath585 $ ] .",
    "wright @xcite proved that the @xmath13-dimensional cremona group @xmath1123 ( i.e. , the group of birational transformations of the complex projective plane ) is isomorphic to the fundamental group of a finite developable complex of groups .",
    "let @xmath1124 denote its development .",
    "thus @xmath1123 acts on @xmath1124 cocompactly .",
    "the positive answer to the following question could lead to a new way of proving that @xmath1123 is acylindrically hyperbolic and hence not simple . note that acylindrical hyperbolicity of @xmath1123 was proved in @xcite and non - simplicity of @xmath1123 was a long - standing conjecture in algebraic geometry resolved in @xcite .",
    "the last problem is inspired by corollary [ ga2 ] .",
    "note that for @xmath182 no nontrivial decomposition of @xmath45 $ ] in an amalgamated product is known , so our strategy of the proof of corollary [ ga2 ] does not work .",
