    "in recent times , minkowski geometry ( i.e. , the geometry of finite dimensional , real banach spaces ; see @xcite ) became again an important research field .",
    "strongly related to banach space theory , finsler geometry and classical convexity , it is permanently enriched by new results in the spirit of discrete and computational geometry , of operations research , location science , and further applied disciplines .",
    "in addition , the most examined concepts of it naturally connect to physics , functional analysis , and non - euclidean geometries .",
    "we will not introduce basic notions and terminology of this field going beyond our purpose ; for its fundaments the reader is referred to the monograph @xcite and to the surveys @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the present paper refers to _ bisectors _ in ( finite dimensional normed or ) _ minkowski spaces _ ,",
    "i.e. , to collections of points which have , in each case , the same distance ( with respect to the corresponding norm ) to two given points @xmath2 , @xmath3 of these spaces .",
    "note that bisectors in minkowski spaces play an essential role in discrete and computational geometry , mainly in view of constructing ( generalized ) voronoi diagrams , and also for motion planning with respect to translations ; see , e.g. , the surveys @xcite and @xcite .    in some previous papers on this topic ( see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) , ",
    ". g. horvth proved that if the unit ball of a minkowski space is strictly convex , then every bisector is a topological hyperplane ( see theorem 2 in @xcite , or @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , example 3 in @xcite shows that strict convexity does not follow from the fact that all bisectors are topological hyperplanes .    in these papers ,",
    "the connections between shadow boundaries of the unit ball and bisectors ( regarding the direction @xmath4 or the points * x * and * y * , respectively ) in minkowski spaces are investigated .",
    "the author was sure that the following statement is true : _ a bisector is a topological hyperplane if and only if the corresponding shadow boundary is a topological @xmath5-dimensional sphere_. however , the respective conjecture was proved only in the three - dimensional case ( theorem 2 and theorem 4 in @xcite ) . in @xcite ,",
    "some further topological observations on shadow boundaries are discussed , e.g. , that they are compact metric spaces containing @xmath5-dimensional closed , connected subsets separating the boundary of @xmath6 .",
    "g. horvth also investigated the manifold case , and he proved ( using an approximation theorem for cell - like mappings ) that the shadow boundary is homeomorphic to an @xmath5-dimensional sphere . consequently",
    "this result ( if the bisector is a homeomorphic copy of @xmath7 , then the shadow boundary is a topological @xmath5-sphere ) confirms the first direction of the above mentioned conjecture .",
    "independently , h. martini and s. wu @xcite introduced and investigated the concept of radial projection of bisectors . strongly using the central symmetry of minkowskian balls , they proved some interesting results on radial projections of bisectors .",
    "theorem 2.6 in @xcite says that the shadow boundary is a subset of the closure of such a radial projection , and theorem 2.9 there refers to the converse statement .",
    "if for a point @xmath2 from the boundary of the unit ball there exists a point @xmath8 , unique except for the sign , such that @xmath2 is orthogonal to @xmath8 in the sense of birkhoff ( see below ) , then @xmath8 is a point of the radial projection of the bisector corresponding to @xmath2 and @xmath9 .    in the present paper",
    "we introduce the concept of bounded representation of bisectors , which yields a useful combination of the notions of bisector , shadow boundary , and radial projection .",
    "we prove that the topological properties of the radial projection ( in higher dimensions ) do not determine the topological properties of the bisector .",
    "more precisely , the manifold property of the bisector does not imply the manifold property of the radial projection ( see our example below ) .",
    "the situation is different with respect to the bounded representation of the bisector .",
    "namely , if one of them is a manifold , then the other is also .",
    "more precisely , if the bisector is a manifold of dimension @xmath10 , then its bounded representation is homeomorphic to a closed @xmath0-dimensional ball @xmath11 ( i.e. , it is a cell of dimension @xmath10 ) . and",
    "conversely , if the bounded representation is a cell , then the closed bisector is also ( theorem 1 ) .",
    "we will also present new approaches to higher dimensional analogues of several theorems given in @xcite . by our new terminology , we will rewrite and reprove theorems 2.6 , 2.9 , and 2.10 from that paper .",
    "let @xmath6 be a compact , convex sets with nonempty interior ( i.e. , a _ convex body _ ) in the @xmath1-dimensional euclidean space @xmath12 which , in addition , is centred at the origin @xmath13 .",
    "then the @xmath0-dimensional boundary bd @xmath6 of @xmath6 , in the following also denoted by @xmath14 , can be interpreted as the _ unit sphere _ of an @xmath1-dimensional ( real banach or ) _ minkowski space _",
    "@xmath15 with norm @xmath16 , i.e. , @xmath17 it is well known that there are different types of orthogonality in minkowski spaces . in particular , for @xmath18 we say that @xmath2 is _ birkhoff orthogonal _ to @xmath3 if @xmath19 for all @xmath20 , denoted by @xmath21 ( see @xcite ) ; and * x * is _ isosceles orthogonal _ to @xmath3 if @xmath22 , denoted by @xmath23 ( cf .",
    "the _ shadow boundary _ @xmath24 of @xmath6 with respect to the direction * x * is the intersection of @xmath14 and all supporting lines of @xmath6 having direction @xmath2 .    given a point @xmath25 ,",
    "the _ bisector _ of @xmath9 and @xmath2 , denoted by @xmath26 , consists of all those vectors * y * which are isosceles orthogonal to @xmath2 with respect to the minkowski norm generated by @xmath6 .",
    "the _ radial projection _",
    "@xmath27 of this bisector consists of those points @xmath3 of @xmath14 for which there is a positive real value @xmath28 such that @xmath29 .",
    "we remark that , in the relative topology of @xmath14 , @xmath27 can either be closed or open ; this can be easily seen in the cases of the euclidean and of the maximum norm .",
    "thus , for topological investigations in higher dimensions we suggest the extension of the definition of @xmath26 to ideal points by a limit property .",
    "consider the compactification of @xmath12 to a closed ball @xmath30 by the set of ideal points @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "we say that @xmath33 if there is a sequence @xmath34 for which @xmath35 .",
    "we call the points of the original bisector _ ordinary points _ and the new points _ ideal points _ , respectively .    by this definition",
    "@xmath27 could be closed as we can see in our first statement .",
    "let @xmath36 be the collection of those points @xmath3 of @xmath14 for which @xmath37 holds , for all real @xmath38 .",
    "let @xmath39 denote the image of @xmath36 under reflection at the origin .    in the described way",
    ", @xmath14 is decomposed into three disjoint sets : @xmath27 , @xmath36 , and @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath27 is an at least @xmath5-dimensional closed ( and therefore compact ) set in @xmath14 which is connected for @xmath40 , the sets @xmath36 and @xmath39 are arc - wise connected components of their union .",
    "* proof : * by theorem 5.1 of @xcite , @xmath27 is connected for @xmath41 . we prove that it is also closed with respect to the relative topology of the boundary of the unit ball . to see this , consider a convergent sequence @xmath42 ) in @xmath27 having the limit * y*. for any @xmath43 there is a new sequence of points @xmath44 such that for every pair @xmath45 there are @xmath46 and @xmath47 such that @xmath48 .",
    "( for an ordinary point the mentioned sequence can be regarded as a constant one . )",
    "it is clear that for the diagonal sequence @xmath49 we have @xmath50 implying that * y * is also in @xmath27 .",
    "the continuity property of the norm function implies that all points of @xmath14 belong to precisely one of the three mentioned sets .",
    "thus the first statement is clear , and the union of @xmath36 and @xmath39 is open with respect to the topology of @xmath14 .",
    "observe once more that @xmath36 and @xmath39 are images of each other regarding reflection at the origin .",
    "furthermore , they are arc - wise connected sets . to prove this , consider the following inequality for an element * y * of @xmath39 : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is an arbitrary parameter .",
    "the point @xmath53 is on the right half - line , starting with the point @xmath54 and being parallel to the vector @xmath2 , meaning that its norm is larger than the norm of the point @xmath55 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . thus @xmath56 and so @xmath57    a consequence of this inequality is that the arc of @xmath14 connecting the respective endpoints of the vectors @xmath3 and @xmath2 belongs to the set @xmath39 .",
    "thus every two points of @xmath39 can be connected by an arc , as we stated .",
    "now , with respect to the topology of their union , they are connected components .",
    "this means that both of them are also open with respect to the topology of @xmath14 .",
    "thus @xmath27 separates @xmath14 . by a theorem of p. s. aleksandrov ( theorem 5.12 in vol .",
    "i of @xcite ) we get that the topological dimension of @xmath27 is at least @xmath58 .",
    "* remark : * if we identify the opposite points of @xmath14 , then we get an @xmath0-dimensional projective space @xmath59 dissected into two parts , one of them open and the other one closed , respectively .",
    "the open part contains the points of the identified sets @xmath39 and @xmath36 , while the closed one contains the identified point - pairs of @xmath27 .",
    "and @xmath60 . ]",
    "we define now an important mapping of the bisector .",
    "let @xmath8 be a point of @xmath26 .",
    "if it is an ordinary point , then there is a unique value @xmath61 for which @xmath62 .",
    "let @xmath63 denote the mapping which sends * z * into @xmath64 .",
    "for ordinary points the mapping @xmath65 of the bisector is continuous .",
    "we extend @xmath65 to the ideal points by the following rule : the image of an ideal point is its radial projection . denote the image set of @xmath65 ( with respect to this extended mapping ) by @xmath66 . we will call this set _ the bounded representation of the bisector_. we now have a connection between the concept of bisector and metrical properties of @xmath6 .",
    "if it is equal to 1 , then the point @xmath69 is a point of a horizontal segment ( parallel to * x * ) of the boundary and thus a point of the shadow boundary , and the set of all points corresponding to the value @xmath60 yields a horizontal segment of @xmath14 .",
    "if now @xmath70 , the points of the bounded representation corresponding to this value @xmath28 form another segment containing the segment of @xmath60 .",
    "thus the directions determined by the points of the segment of @xmath60 are ideal points of the bisector , proving that the points of the shadow boundary are images of certain ideal points .",
    "now , by the definition of ideal points , the continuity of the mapping is clear .",
    "in fact , we have to check that the image of a point of the bisector with large norm is close to the boundary @xmath14 of @xmath6 .",
    "since , by definition , @xmath60 is equal to @xmath73 , we have the two inequalities @xmath74 showing that for @xmath8 with large norm its bounded representation is close to @xmath14 . to visualize the proof , we show in fig .",
    "2 the bisector and its bounded representation in a two - dimensional space .      _",
    "the bounded representation of the bisector @xmath75 with respect to any point * x * from the unit sphere of a minkowski space is contained in an @xmath0-subspace if and only if the minkowski space is euclidean . _    it is easy to see that the shadow boundary @xmath76 is the set of points of @xmath14 which are orthogonal to the vector @xmath2 in the sense of birkhoff , and thus some results on birkhoff orthogonality in @xcite can be extended to higher dimensions .",
    "these are described in the following .",
    "theorem 2.6 in @xcite says that the shadow boundary is a subset of the closure of the radial projection .",
    "a consequence of the concept of bounded representation of the bisector is the fact that such theorems can be extended to higher dimensions . to prove this , we observe that the radial projection is exactly the radial projection of the bounded representation of the bisector , implied by lemma 1 .",
    "so it contains the shadow boundary , extending theorem 2.6 of @xcite .",
    "theorem 2.9 in @xcite refers to the converse statement . if for a point @xmath2 of @xmath14 there exists a unique point @xmath8 ( except for the sign ) such that @xmath2 is orthogonal to @xmath8 in the sense of birkhoff , then @xmath8 is a point of the radial projection of the bisector corresponding to @xmath2 .",
    "if we denote the sharp points of the shadow boundary as those points of @xmath6 which are unique in their carrying supporting line of @xmath6 parallel to @xmath2 , we can say that the sharp points of the shadow boundary corresponding to the direction of @xmath2 belong to the radial projection of the bisector of @xmath2 .",
    "this is also a consequence of our present definitions and lemma 1 .",
    "let now @xmath77 , and assume that @xmath8 is the radial projection of an ideal point of the bisector of @xmath2 .",
    "then it belongs to the shadow boundary of @xmath2 implying that it is birkhoff orthogonal to @xmath2 .",
    "thus , if we consider a boundary point * z * of the radial projection which is not birkhoff orthogonal to @xmath2 , this is a projective image of an ordinary point of the bisector .",
    "thus @xmath8 is a point of the radial projection in the classical sense , too .",
    "this proves theorem 2.10 in @xcite      if the bisector is a manifold of dimension @xmath10 with boundary , then its bounded representation is homeomorphic to the @xmath0-dimensional closed ball @xmath11 .",
    "conversely , if the bounded representation is a topological ball of dimension @xmath10 , then the bisector is of the same type .",
    "furthermore , its relative interior ( which is the set of its ordinary points ) is a topological hyperplane of dimension @xmath10 .",
    "* proof : * assume that the bisector is a manifold of dimension @xmath10 with boundary .",
    "then an ordinary point has a relatively open @xmath0-dimensional neighborhood in the bisector , and thus there are interior points . on the other hand",
    ", there is no ideal point which could be in the relative interior of the bisector implying that the set of ordinary points of the bisector is a manifold of dimension @xmath10 .",
    "hence our assumption implies that the shadow boundary @xmath24 is a manifold of dimension @xmath58 .",
    "in fact , from theorem 5 and theorem 4 in @xcite we get that the shadow boundary is also a topological manifold of dimension @xmath58 .",
    "theorem 2 says that it is homeomorphic to @xmath78 . on the other hand ,",
    "the set @xmath79 of midpoints of correspondingly directed chords containing interior points of @xmath6 is always homeomorphic to the positive part @xmath80 of the boundary @xmath14 of @xmath6 , determined by the shadow boundary .",
    "thus it is homeomorphic to @xmath81 .",
    "finally we observe that the boundary of the latter set @xmath79 is the shadow boundary itself , showing that the bounded representation of the bisector is homeomorphic to @xmath11 , as we stated .",
    "we remark that the converse statement is true if and only if the manifold property of the bounded representation can be extended to the bisector .",
    "this is clear for the points mapping to the interior of @xmath6 , but it is not evident for other points of the bisector .",
    "the problem is that the pre - images of a point of the shadow boundary could form a point or a half - line , respectively .",
    "thus @xmath65 is not an injective ( but , of course , a surjective ) continuous mapping . clearly , both of the two sets ( the bisector and its bounded representation ) are continua , i.e. , compact , connected hausdorff ( @xmath82 ) spaces .",
    "moreover , the points and half - lines are cell - like sets ; thus @xmath83 is a cell - like mapping . restricting @xmath83 to the ideal point of the bisector",
    ", we get a bijective mapping onto the shadow boundary .",
    "we prove that the set of ideal points is compact in the bisector .",
    "of course , the ideal points of the bisector give a proper part @xmath84 of @xmath85 bounding the topological ball @xmath30 .",
    "hence this point set can be regarded as a subset of an @xmath0-dimensional euclidean space @xmath81 .",
    "( we can consider @xmath86 as the center of a stereographic projection . )",
    "its clear that @xmath84 is bounded .",
    "it is also closed by its definition , and so it is compact by the heine - borel theorem on compact sets in @xmath81 ( see , e.g. , p. 9 in @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", the shadow boundary can also be regarded as an @xmath5-sphere embedded into a euclidean @xmath0-space , because @xmath2 is not a point of it .",
    "a continuous and bijective mapping from a compact set of @xmath81 into @xmath81 is a homeomorphism ( see again @xcite ) .",
    "thus the ideal points of the bisector give a topological @xmath5-dimensional sphere .",
    "now we prove that the ordinary points of the bisector are , with respect to its relative topology , interior points of it .",
    "we remark that it is trivial for a point @xmath87 if @xmath88 is an interior point of @xmath6 , because @xmath65 ( by its definition ) is a homeomorphism on the collection of such points onto the interior of the bounded representation of the bisector .",
    "thus it is also relatively open with respect to the bisector , and this part of the bisector is a topological manifold , homeomorphic to @xmath81 .",
    "let now @xmath88 belong to the shadow boundary .",
    "since it is a topological sphere of dimension @xmath58 , there is a cell of dimension @xmath58 ( a homeomorphic copy of a closed ball of dimension @xmath58 ) , namely @xmath89 , containing @xmath88 in its interior .",
    "the pre - image @xmath90 of the interior @xmath91 of @xmath92 is ( by the continuity of @xmath65 ) open with respect to the topology of the bisector and contains @xmath8 .",
    "thus it has also an interior point with respect to the topology of the bisector .",
    "finally we observe that from the compactness of @xmath92 the existence of an @xmath93 follows for which the set @xmath94 is a closed cone ( truncated by two parallel surfaces ) containing @xmath8 in its interior .",
    "since the interior of this body is homeomorphic to @xmath81 , we get that the set of ordinary points is a manifold of dimension @xmath10 . in the proof of theorem 5 from @xcite",
    "it is shown that if the ordinary points of the bisector yield an @xmath0-manifold , then it is homeomorphic to @xmath81 , and theorem 6 there establishes that it is a topological hyperplane .",
    "thus we proved that the closed bisector is a cell of dimension @xmath10 whose interior can be embedded in the @xmath1-dimensional euclidean space in a standard ( unknotted ) way , as we stated .    in higher dimensions the topology of the radial projection does ( in contrast to the bounded representation )",
    "not simplify by the simplification of the topology of the bisector .",
    "finally we give an example showing that it is possible that the bisector is a manifold with boundary of dimension @xmath10 , but @xmath27 is not a manifold .",
    "take a cartesian coordinate system in the euclidean space , with the respective coordinate - axes @xmath95 and @xmath96 , and vectors @xmath2 and @xmath8 having coordinates @xmath97 and @xmath98 , respectively .",
    "consider the example from @xcite in which the body @xmath6 is the convex hull of two half - circles with parallel diameters and in symmetric position with respect to the origin , such that their affine hulls are parallel to the plane @xmath99 ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . besides the two half circles ,",
    "the ruled part of the boundary of their convex hull contains four conic surface parts and two opposite triangles .",
    "the bounded representation of the bisector corresponding to the direction orthogonal to the planes of the half - circles is homeomorphic to a plane .",
    "it can be obtained in the following way : cut the surface of @xmath6 by the segments parallel to @xmath2 into two parts .",
    "the described half - disks do no longer belong to the surface .",
    "apply an affinity to these two parts , by the ratio @xmath100 , with direction orthogonal to the end planes .",
    "finally glue these parts together at their common vertical segment @xmath101 $ ] .",
    "it is clear that the central projection of this ruled surface from the midpoint of @xmath101 $ ] is the union of those curves which are the intersections of the planes through @xmath101 $ ] and the respective points of @xmath14 .",
    "the obtained four parts are conic surfaces separated by @xmath102 , @xmath8 and the two opposite points of the half - circles lying on the horizontal plane @xmath103 .",
    "of course , in this case the radial projection is not a topological manifold ."
