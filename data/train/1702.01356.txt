    "ice noises were observed to be either broadband or tonal in nature , lasting from 1 to 100 s. broadband ice noise extended across the frequency band ( fig .",

    "frequency ice tonals could be modeled as resonance in an infinitely long sea ice block of uniform height , density , and velocity generated by frictional shear stress on its edge .",
    "the nonlinear tonals observed here may indicate anomalies in the local height or composition of the sea ice or a frictional stress that is velocity  dependent ( fig .",
    "[ fig : squeak1 ] ) .",
    "the degree of nonlinearity varies between hydrophone recordings ( fig .",
    "[ fig : squeak2 ] ) , indicating that significant changes in ice properties and dynamics may occur within the spatiotemporal span of 23 array drift days .",
    "another interesting case is ocean swell  modulated ice tonals , with period @xmath89 s ( fig .",

    "frequency signals travel great distances within the subsurface sound propagation channel .",
    "location , type and date of surveys in norwegian territory are available through the norwegian petroleum directorate . according to these data ,",
    "the array was between 1800 and 3500 km distant from seismic surveys at the beginning of its transit in april and 1000 to 3000 km at the end in september . using the advanced microwave scanning radiometer-2 ( amsr-2 ) 89-ghz channel satellite dataset ( ) ,",
    "@xcite the array was found to be about 1000 km distant from the ice edge in april and 200 km distant in september ( fig .",

    "has been successful in detecting and locating earthquakes originating from this juncture.@xcite    earthquakes can be observed acoustically through the @xmath0 phase arrival .",
    "the @xmath0 phase is an acoustic pressure wave coupled into the water column from the ocean bottom at an anomaly ( for example , a seamount ) .",

    "the differences in arrival time between the three waves can be used to localize the earthquake if appropriate propagation velocities are known .",
    "@xmath0 phase arrivals were observed during the array transit in summer 2013 , indicating that arctic basin earthquakes also contribute to the low  frequency soundscape ( fig .",

    "in this section , spectral estimates from different months at several depths are compared to establish the spatiotemporal dependence of ambient noise in the eastern arctic during summer 2013 .",
    "three days were selected to examine the daily variation in median ambient noise levels : may 7 , july 14 , september 10 ( fig .  [ fig : dailymonthly ] ) .",
    "the 10@xmath16 , 50@xmath16 ( median ) , and 90@xmath16 percentiles for may 2013 show the variation in spectral shape between the most and least frequent generation mechanisms .",
    "for example , cable strum is visible at f @xmath12 10 hz in the 90@xmath16 percentile .",
    "other peaks near 10100 hz may be caused by flow ",
    "related noise or seismic survey activity .",
    "the 10@xmath16 percentile is defined by single , broad peak at 15 hz due to distant sources within the sound channel .",
    "the daily median estimates progress from least to most peaked , with may 7 showing a peak  to  peak ( 15 to 900 hz ) difference of 26 db and september 10 showing a peak  to  peak difference of 44 db .",
    "this trend indicates that the earlier spatiotemporal recordings contain more higher frequency noises whereas the later recordings were influenced by lower frequency sources .",
    "the trend of increasing peakedness in the median spectral is more apparent in the monthly median spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dailymonthly ] ) . at low frequencies ( f @xmath12 100 hz ) ,",
    "an increase in median ambient noise levels corresponds to decreasing distance to the ice edge and to seismic survey activity . at higher frequencies ( f @xmath7 100 hz ) median",
    "ambient noise levels decrease with time , corresponding to fewer ice creak signatures observed in spectrograms . when limited data was available , such as in august , the median monthly spectra was likely to show evidence of flow  related noise i.e. at about 75 and 90 hz , despite efforts to remove this noise .",
    "it is interesting to note these spatiotemporal differences in median ambient noise levels with proximity to the marginal ice zone ( miz ) ; the effect of the miz on ambient noise was previously studied only for distances less than 150 km @xcite .",
    "the decrease in high  frequency median ambient noise levels may represent a physical change in the spatial or temporal ice stress field .",
    "the median ambient noise depth profile during summer 2013 was found to depend on frequency . at low frequencies ( 1050 hz ) , a local peak in median ambient noise",
    "is centered in the subsurface propagation channel at the depth where ice reflections and upward refracting rays converge ( fig .",
    "[ fig : depth ] ) .",
    "below the sound channel and at higher frequencies ( 200500 hz ) , the median noise level is constant with depth as expected for an isotropic distribution of surface sources ( fig .",
    "[ fig : depth ] ) .",
    "there is a strong signal during may at about 400  600 m depth that is likely due to flow  related noise , which could not be completely removed from the lower hydrophones using the noise filtering method ( sec .",

    "<S> the soundscape in the eastern arctic was studied from april to september 2013 using a 22 element vertical hydrophone array as it drifted from near the north pole ( 8923n , 6235w ) to north of fram strait ( 8345n 428 w ) . </S>",
    "<S> the hydrophones recorded for 108 minutes on six days per week with a sampling rate of 1953.125 hz . </S>",
    "<S> after removal of data corrupted by nonacoustic flow  related noise , 19 days throughout the transit period were analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> major contributors include broadband and tonal ice noises , seismic airgun surveys , and earthquake @xmath0 phases . </S>",
    "<S> statistical spectral analyses show a broad peak at about 15 hz similar to that previously observed and a mid  frequency decrease at f@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the median noise levels reflect a change in dominant sources , with ice noises ( 200500 hz ) decreasing and seismic airgun surveys ( 1050 hz ) increasing as the array transited southward . </S>",
    "<S> the median noise levels were among the lowest of the sparse reported observations in the eastern arctic , but comparable to the more numerous observations of western arctic noise levels . </S>"
