    "continuous ( or second order ) quantum phase transitions in many - electron systems are of general interest to condensed matter physicists.@xcite recently a class of such quantum phase transitions , namely the transitions between different quantum hall plateaus , and the transition between a quantum hall phase and an insulating phase at high magnetic field ( @xmath0 ) , have been under extensive experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite study . in the renormalization group ( rg ) language , continuous phase transitions are controlled by rg fixed points , and many properties of the transition depend only on which fixed point the transition is controlled by , or which universality class it belongs to , and independent of microscopic details of the system .",
    "the best known examples of such universal properties are of course the critical exponents . in principle , quantities that are dimensionless are possibly universal at the critical point",
    ". of particular interest in the study of quantum hall transitions is the conductivity tensor at the critical point , which in two dimensions ( 2d ) can be expressed as dimensionless numbers times the fundamental unit of conductance , @xmath1 .",
    "it has been suggested that they should be universal , both at superfluid - insulator transition,@xcite and quantum hall transitions.@xcite in the latter case , which is the focus of the present paper , this suggestion has received support from both experimental@xcite study at the quantum hall - insulator transition at high magnetic field ( or transition in the lowest landau level ) , and numerical works in the lowest landau level@xcite and the network model .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we will present further experimental evidence that supports the universality of conductivity tensor at integer quantum hall transitions , in both the lowest landau level and _ higher _ landau levels ; we also demonstrate that the transitions in different landau levels are in the same universality class .",
    "we will also present results of numerical studies of the integer quantum hall transitions , based on non - interacting electron models ; our results suggest that another dimensionless quantity , the thouless conductance , a quantity that is closely related to the longitudinal conductance of the system , is also universal at integer quantum hall transitions .    by definition ,",
    "a quantum critical point is a critical point at zero temperature @xmath2 .",
    "real experiments , however , are always done at finite temperatures , and the critical point can only be reached asymptotically in the low temperature limit of the experiments .",
    "we will also present data on the @xmath3 dependence of various physical quantities near the critical point , and study how the universal values of the resistivity ( or conductivity ) tensor are reached asymptotically . in a",
    "_ noninteracting _ system , the effect of a finite @xmath3 is to set a finite dephasing length , which effectively divide an otherwise infinite system into incoherent finite pieces , and introduce finite size effects to the critical behavior .",
    "we have therefore also studied the size dependence of the thouless conductance , near the critical point .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in section [ experiment ]",
    "we present our experimental results on studies of the resistivity tensor , both at the high field qh - insulator _ and _ qh - qh critical points .",
    "we study their behavior not only in the asymptotic low temperature limit , but also the temperature dependence at higher temperature , and how the universal values are approached as temperature decreases . in section",
    "[ theory ] we present results of our numerical study on a non - interacting electron model on a lattice , and demonstrate that at the critical points , the properly defined thouless conductance is a universal number that is independent of the strength and type of random potential , amount of mixing between different landau levels ( subbands ) , whether there is particle - hole symmetry , etc .",
    "we also study the system size dependence of the thouless conductance at the critical points , and demonstrate that the universal asymptotic value is reached at surprisingly small system sizes in the lowest landau subband . in section [ summary ]",
    "we summarize our findings by discussing the relations between our experimental and numerical results , as well as their relevance to existing theoretical and experimental works on this subject .",
    "in this section we describe our experimental results .",
    "while our main finding has already been published before@xcite , we will present here a more detailed account of our study of the qh to insulator at low @xmath3 . since the main motivation of our work was to test for",
    "the theoretically predicted _ universal _ features , we have set to study a broad range of samples that represents much of the available 2des samples at the time of this work . in fig .",
    "[ mobilitydensity ] we illustrate the large diversity of samples studied by plotting the mobility ( @xmath4 ) vs. density ( n ) of some of our samples .",
    "the range of the axis in this figure is chosen to represent virtually the entire range of 2des that is reported in the literature ( @xmath5 @xmath6/vsec and @xmath7 @xmath8 ) . as can be seen ,",
    "our samples cover a significant area in of this log - log graph . to increase the generality of our results we obtained our samples from 6 different sources including 3 mbe , one lpe and two mo - cvd machines .",
    "to insure that geometrical factors , which are known to introduce modifications to transport in the qh regime , do not come into play in our study , we did not maintain a uniform sample geometry .",
    "rather , our samples were cut in many different shapes : some where wet - etched in a hall - bar shape of various dimensions , and others were cleaved in a square or rectangular shape with contacts diffused along the edges .",
    "the smallest contact to contact dimension was 100 @xmath4 m while the largest was 1 mm .",
    "naturally , we did not adhere to a specific structure design of the wafers and there too diversity abound as we studied 2des s embedded in gaas / algaas heterostructures and quantum wells ( qw s ) , ingaas / inalas qw s , ingaas / inp heterostructures , alas / gaas qw s , ge / sige qw s and si mosfet s .",
    "the total number of samples studied at low @xmath3 s exceeds 150 .",
    "quite generally , the qh series terminates , at high @xmath0 , with a transition to an insulating phase .",
    "a typical transition is shown in fig .",
    "[ typtransition ] , where we plot @xmath0 traces of the diagonal resistivity , @xmath9 , taken at several @xmath3 s . the sample exhibit metallic behavior at low @xmath0 followed by a set of integer qh states manifested by minima in @xmath9 . as @xmath0 is further increased beyond @xmath10 , @xmath9 increases for all @xmath3 s . if we examine , however , the @xmath3 dependence of @xmath9 focusing on the high-@xmath0 region ( fig .",
    "[ crosspoint ] ) , we observe a stark change in its character : in the qh region , @xmath9 increases with @xmath3 , while at higher @xmath0 the opposite occurs , and @xmath9 decreases with @xmath3 .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to use the temperature coefficient of resistivity ( tcr ) to delineate two different transport regimes : the qh state ( tcr@xmath11 ) and the insulator ( tcr@xmath12 ) .",
    "we adopt this empirical ` definition ' of the phases for the rest of this paper .    examining fig .",
    "[ crosspoint ] further reveals another transport feature which is typical to the qh - to - insulator transition .",
    "it is possible , at low @xmath3 , to identify a clear and well - defined @xmath0 value for which the tcr vanishes , within experimental error .",
    "the existence of this critical @xmath0 value ( @xmath13 ) allows us to unambiguously determine ( subject to the definition of the previous paragraph ) the boundary between the qh state and the insulator .",
    "a complete phase diagram can be obtained by following the position of this ` crossing ' point as other relevant parameters such as disorder or @xmath14 is changed , as was done extensively by wong _ et al._@xcite , song _",
    "et al._@xcite and others .    in a recent paper , shahar _",
    "et al._@xcite reported on a study of the @xmath9 value at @xmath13 ( @xmath15 ) for a large collection of samples .",
    "they noticed that , in accordance with theoretical expectations@xcite , @xmath15 seems to be close to the quantum unit or resistance , @xmath16 , independent of sample parameters .",
    "further , they showed that this apparent universality holds also for transitions from the @xmath17 fractional qh state to the insulator , again in agreement with theoretical predictions@xcite .    in the reminder of this section",
    "we expand on these previous findings by concentrating on the transport properties at the critical point .",
    "we will provide further evidence for the notion of universality near the qh - to - insulator transition , and remark on the qh - qh transitions .",
    "we will also closely examine the transport at the critical point and show that , at higher @xmath3 s , systematic deviation of @xmath9 are clearly seen , although their trend and magnitude are sample dependent .",
    "finally , we will discuss the disorder - driven qh - insulator transition which is realized experimentally by changing @xmath14 by means of a metallic front - gate@xcite .",
    "we will emphasize the similarities between the disorder and magnetic field driven transitions .",
    "we would like to precede the discussion of our data with a note of caution .",
    "it would be an unreasonable expectation that _ all _ samples will behave uniformly in any subset of their transport characteristics .",
    "it is well - known , for instance , that samples exhibiting the fqhe do not undergo a transition from the @xmath10 iqhe to an insulator ( they will , ultimately , undergo a transition to an insulator at higher @xmath0 from a fqhe state ) .",
    "we therefore need to define clearly which subset of our samples will be included in our test for universality at the qh to insulator transitions . to clarify this",
    "need we plot , in fig .",
    "[ badsample ] , @xmath0 traces of @xmath9 taken at several @xmath3 s for a gaas / algaas sample grown on ( 311)a substrate to produce hole carriers .",
    "the `` qh '' state marked on the figure as @xmath17 is clearly abnormal with a very high minimum resistivity at the lowest @xmath3 .",
    "it is not surprising that the following `` transition '' ( common crossing point of the different @xmath3 traces ) to an insulator is at a very high value , @xmath18 k@xmath19 , which significantly deviates from universality .",
    "the above discussion leads to a natural , albeit arbitrary , criterion for the `` suitability '' of a given transition for a test of universality : for a transition to be considered , we require that it exhibit a fully developed qh state followed by a strong insulating behavior.@xcite in both cases different tests can be considered to define the `` strength '' of the phase , and we chose for the qh a resistivity that decrease exponentially with decreasing @xmath3 and , in addition , a value of @xmath9 at the qh minimum which is less than @xmath20 at our lowest @xmath3 , such that it is undecernable from zero when plotted on a scale which includes the transition point .",
    "similarly we defined a fully developed insulator if @xmath9 increases monotonously with @xmath0 and @xmath3 and reaches a value greater then @xmath21 at our lower @xmath3 .",
    "arbitrary as they are , these simple criteria safely eliminate from consideration samples like that of fig .",
    "[ badsample ] .    in a previous letter@xcite we reported the observation of a universal value of @xmath15 . in fig .",
    "[ rxxcbc ] we plot @xmath15 vs. @xmath13 for 20 of our samples .",
    "in fact , other absisca could have equally been used , such as @xmath4 or @xmath14 , as @xmath15 is rather independent of sample parameters and appears to be scattered around @xmath16 ( solid line in fig .",
    "[ rxxcbc ] ) .",
    "two points should be emphasized .",
    "first , as we noted before , the @xmath15 value is not significantly different between samples that undergo the transition from the @xmath10 integer qh state ( empty symbols ) and those for which the transition takes place from the @xmath22 fractional qh state ( solid symbols ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the theoretical notion of super - universality@xcite .",
    "we will not be discussing fractional qh transitions in the remainder of this paper .",
    "second , the data points are scattered over a relatively wide range of @xmath23 around @xmath16 .",
    "this scatter is evident not only for different samples but also for different cool - downs of the same sample .",
    "this cool - down dependence of @xmath15 is particularly puzzling if we recall that are samples are all of rather large size .",
    "this point has been emphasized in our previous publication , and is not yet understood theoretically .",
    "so far , we reviewed our definition of the transition @xmath13 and discussed the low-@xmath3 value of @xmath15 .",
    "we now proceed to discuss the @xmath3-dependence of @xmath15 at higher @xmath3 s . in fig .",
    "[ rxxt ] we plot @xmath15 vs. @xmath3 for several samples .",
    "depending on the sample and the @xmath3 range at hand , different forms of behavior are observed .",
    "common to all samples is a certain range at the lowest @xmath3 where @xmath15 is @xmath3 independent , as expected at the critical point of the transition .",
    "this value of @xmath15 is the value plotted in fig .",
    "[ rxxcbc ] . as @xmath3",
    "is increased , systematic deviations are observed in most samples .",
    "the @xmath3 where these deviations appear is sample dependent , as is the trend which they take . in [ rxxtlog ]",
    "we plot @xmath15 vs. @xmath3 on a log scale which shows that for this particular sample , where we have a relatively wide range of data , a logarithmic @xmath3 dependence of @xmath15 is a reasonable description of the data .",
    "this dependence is similar to that observed for 2d disordered metals at low @xmath3 and @xmath24 .",
    "it is not clear whether the various mechanisms that lead to the logarithmic @xmath3-dependence at @xmath24 are applicable for the high-@xmath0 case .    in the limit of strong disorder ,",
    "the qh ceases to exist and is replaced with an insulating behavior .",
    "it is a reasonable expectation , that if one could vary the effective disorder over a wide enough range , a transition from a qh state to an insulator will be observed .",
    "this expectation was verified in experiments@xcite . in fact , the disorder - induced transition was shown to be remarkably similar to the @xmath0-field - induced one as far as its critical properties are concerned@xcite . to vary the effective disorder the experimentalist usually employs a metallic gate deposited near the 2d electrons . by biasing the gate with respect to the electron system @xmath14 can be varied continuously , resulting in an effective disorder change via the dependence of the impurities potential - strength on the screening effectiveness of the electrons which , in turn , depends on @xmath14 . in fig .",
    "[ disrxxt ] we plot @xmath15 vs. @xmath3 in the vicinity of a disorder - induced @xmath10 to insulator transition .",
    "the different sets of data correspond , in this figure , to different gate - voltage bias and therefore to different disorder .",
    "the qualitative similarity to the @xmath0 induced transition is clear .",
    "in addition we note that @xmath15 for this transition is * * 24k@xmath19 , again close to @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath3 range of our study in this case is not sufficient to detect the high-@xmath3 deviations of @xmath15 .",
    "finally we remark on the behavior at the critical point of qh - qh plateau - to - plateau transitions .",
    "as we demonstrated in a recent paper@xcite , a direct and clear relation exist between these transitions : it is possible to map the qh - to - insulator transition to a qh - qh transition by considering the former as a qh - insulator transition occurring at the top ll in the presence of an inert ( full ) bottom ll . in ref .",
    "@xcite we found that the transition point , when properly identified , is at a value which is close ( within 20% ) to the theoretically predicted value of @xmath25 ( see fig [ qhqh ] ) .",
    "many other samples exhibit qh - qh with @xmath15 much smaller than expected .",
    "we are uncertain why the qh - insulator transition yields a more consistent critical behavior than the qh - qh case .",
    "in this section we present results of numerical studies of the thouless conductance at the critical point , using a non - interacting electron model on a square lattice , described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath26 where the integers @xmath27 and @xmath14 are the @xmath28 and @xmath29 coordinates of the lattice site in terms of lattice constant , @xmath30 is the fermion operator on that site , h.c .",

    "@xcite in the absence of random potential we have three landau subbands , and the hall conductance ( in unit of @xmath54 ) for each subband is 1 for the two side bands and @xmath55 for the central band . as random potential",
    "is turned on , most states get localized , but there will be one critical energy in each side band ( @xmath56 ) and two critical energies ( @xmath57 ) in the central band , at which states are delocalized .",

    "it is clear from the plot that @xmath49 has essentially reached its asymptotic value for @xmath59 ; the size dependence of @xmath49 at smaller sizes will be discussed later . @xmath60 and @xmath61 move together as @xmath35 increases , and at @xmath62 they merge together and kill each other , and all states become localized.@xcite    in the following we will focus on the value of @xmath49 at the critical energies . in fig .",
    "[ unc]a we show the size - independent peak value of @xmath49 at @xmath63 , for different randomness strength @xmath35 s , and @xmath64 ( which we believe to be in the asymptotic regime already ) .",
    "the value of @xmath49 is the same at @xmath65 , due to particle - hole symmetry of the model .",
    "we find @xmath66 , _ independent _ of the value of @xmath35 . in fig .",
    "[ unc]b we present the peak value of @xmath49 in the lowest landau subband for @xmath67 and @xmath68 , at different @xmath35 s , and system sizes @xmath69 and @xmath70 respectively .",
    "we have checked that for these sizes the peak value of @xmath49 of the lowest landau subband is already at its asymptotic value .",
    "again we get the same value , within error bars , even though we have different field strength and different number of landau subbands .",
    "so far we have only studied uncorrelated random potentials on the lattice , which maps onto gaussian white noise potential in the continuum limit . in the following",
    "we study random potentials with short - range correlations .",
    "we use the following way to generate short - range correlation : numerically we generate an uncorrelated random number @xmath71 , uniformly distributed from @xmath34 to @xmath35 , for each lattice site @xmath72 . instead of using @xmath71 as the random potential @xmath73 as before , we take @xmath74 where the summation is over the four neighboring sites of @xmath72 . this way the potential of one site is correlated with its nearest and next nearest neighbors , and the amount of correlation",
    "is determined by @xmath75 . in fig .",
    "[ corr ] we show the size - independent peak value of @xmath49 ( again based on data with @xmath64 ) at @xmath60 , for @xmath50 , @xmath76 , at different @xmath75 s .",
    "we find within error bars it is independent of @xmath75 , and takes the same value as the uncorrelated potential ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "our data clearly indicates that @xmath78 is a universal number at the critical energy of the lowest landau subband of the square lattice , independent of the strength of the randomness and magnetic field , as well as the type of random potential ( correlated or uncorrelated ) . within error bars ,",
    "the same universal number is also found in the lowest landau level of the _ continuum system _ in ref . , where the same definition of the thouless conductance was used .",
    "we point out however that in our calculation , no projection to individual subbands is made , and mixing between different landau subbands ( or levels ) ( which is often important in real systems ) is taken into account .",
    "we thus conclude that just like the conductivity tensor , the thouless conductance is a universal number at integer quantum hall transition in noninteracting electron models ( either on a lattice or in the continuum ) .    in principle",
    ", the truly universal value of @xmath49 at the critical energies is reached in the thermodynamic limit @xmath79 only ; there is always finite size correction of @xmath49 at finite @xmath37 , and the correction should decrease as @xmath37 increases . as discussed in section [ intro ] , in a noninteracting system a finite system size is equivalent to finite temperature in an infinite system .",
    "since real experiments are always done at finite temperatures , such finite size effects are observable .",
    "motivated by this we have also studied the size dependence of @xmath49 at the critical energies . in fig .",
    "[ ld1 ] we plot the dependence of @xmath49 at @xmath63 for @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "we find , quite remarkably , that for @xmath37 as small as 9 , @xmath49 has essentially saturated at the asymptotic value , indicating that the finite size corrections of @xmath49 disappear extremely fast as @xmath37 increases .",
    "the deviation of @xmath49 at @xmath80 from the universal value is clearly due to finite size corrections ; associated with that , we have also found strong dependence of the peak value of @xmath49 at @xmath80 on the randomness strength @xmath35 , as shown in fig .",
    "we find the bigger @xmath35 is , the closer to the universal value @xmath49 becomes .",
    "this is reasonable because the stronger randomness is more effective in localizing states away from critical energies , and therefore suppress finite size effects .",
    "no such dependence on @xmath35 , however , is found for larger @xmath37 where @xmath49 has saturated at the universal value .    in the rg language ,",
    "the finite size corrections to universal properties at the critical point is due to the existence of irrelevant operators , whose strength scales to zero in the thermodynamic limit under rg at the critical point , while they remain finite in finite size systems .",
    "it has been known@xcite for some time now , based on numerical studies , that the length scale required for such irrelevant operators to scale away is quite small in the lowest landau level , while in higher landau levels it becomes very large .",
    "the origin of this difference is not yet fully understood .",
    "our results in the lowest landau subband is clearly consistent with this finding .",
    "also consistent with this , we do see some weak size dependence of the peak value of @xmath49 in higher subbands ( see fig .",
    "[ size ] ) , suggesting the existence of finite size correction in the size range of our numerical study .",
    "we have also found strong dependence of the peak value of @xmath49 in higher subbands on @xmath35 for a given size as shown in fig .",
    "the dependence is very similar to that of the peak value of @xmath49 in the lowest subband with @xmath80 , where we know finite size corrections are present .",
    "based on these we conclude that finite size corrections are quite important in higher landau subbands within the size range of the present study , and conjecture that in the thermodynamic limit , the peak value of @xmath49 will saturate at the same universal value as in the lowest subband , provided that the critical energy carries hall conductance @xmath81 .",
    "we will discuss the possible experimental consequences of these finite size effects in section [ summary ] .",
    "in this paper we have presented results of detailed experimental studies on the universality of the resistivity tensor at the quantum critical points separating an integer quantum hall phase and the high magnetic field insulator , as well as critical points separating different integer quantum hall phases .",
    "our results strongly suggest that the resistivity tensor is universal at the critical points , and that quantum hall - insulator and quantum hall - quantum hall transitions are in the same universality class .",
    "this is in agreement with previous experimental studies , as well as general theoretical expectations .",
    "we have also studied such transitions using a non - interacting electron model on a lattice , and found that the thouless conductance at the critical points is universal .",
    "this is in agreement with our experimental findings , as well as previous theoretical studies using different models and approaches .",
    "it has been known for a long time that the thouless conductance is closely related to the longitudinal conductivity of the system ; they are believed to be of the same order of magnitude , no matter the system is in the insulating phase , metallic phase , or at the critical point , and are roughly proportional to each other .",
    "people have not succeeded , however , in establishing an exact relation between these two quantities in general .",
    "if both of them are universal at the critical point , their ratio must also be universal at the critical point . since numerically the thouless conductance is much easier to calculate than the longitudinal conductivity , such a simple relation should be very useful in future researches .",
    "it will also be very interesting to see if the same ratio relates these two quantities away from the critical point .",
    "we have also , probably for the first time in the literature , presented a detailed analysis on how the universal values of the resistivity tensor are approached in the asymptotic low temperature regime , and the deviation from the universal values at higher temperatures .",
    "we find that the logitudinal resistivity @xmath9 at the critical point has some sizable , and apparently non - systematic deviation from the universal value at relatively high temperatures ; while the hall resistivity @xmath82 has essentially no such deviation in the same temperature range .",
