    "galaxies with a bolometric luminosity exceeding 10@xmath5l@xmath6 are often powered by a combination of massive star formation and accretion of material around active nuclei ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "early in cosmic history the connection between these two phenomena may have led to a coeval growth of super massive black holes ( smbhs ) and stellar spheroids ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and could thus be the foundation of the correlation observed between the masses of these two components in the local universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , the implication of such a co - evolution in the more general context of the stellar mass built - up history ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and smbh formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has not been fully addressed .",
    "understanding the importance of this `` coordinated '' activity of starbursts and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) requires properly deconvolving their respective contributions _ within individual objects , _ a challenging task particularly for distant sources .",
    "because of the complexity of the agn and starburst spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , this decomposition can best be achieved by combining data from wavebands that offer distinctive spectral features to characterize these phenomena .",
    "for instance , active nuclei are strong emitters at high energy and they are usually associated with a continuum of hot dust peaking in the mid - infrared ( ir ) .",
    "luminous starbursts , on the other hand , are characterized by a colder dust component and emit the bulk of their luminosity in the far - ir . to illustrate how the coexistence of these two processes at high redshift could be studied using larger samples , we present a panchromatic analysis of a luminous agn referenced as cxo  gws  j141741.9 + 522823 ( hereafter cxo - j1417 ) by @xcite .",
    "it is embedded in an ultra - luminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ) at @xmath0=1.15 and its detection across the full electromagnetic spectrum allows us to constrain the level of star formation also present in this source .",
    "we assume a @xmath7cdm cosmology with h@xmath8=70  km  s@xmath9mpc@xmath9 , @xmath10=0.3 and @xmath11 .",
    "cxo - j1417 is a bright x - ray source also known in the literature as cfrs14.1157 or cudss 14.13 .",
    "it is associated with a very red galaxy ( @xmath12@xmath13@xmath32.6 : @xcite ; see also @xcite ) detected in the mid - ir @xcite , submillimeter @xcite and radio @xcite .",
    "high resolution images obtained with _ hst _",
    "@xcite reveal several components presumably interacting with each other ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the brightest is dominated by a point source located at ra=14@xmath1417@xmath154189 and dec=52@xmath162823.65(j2000 , @xmath17ra@xmath3@xmath17dec@xmath30.07 ) coinciding precisely with the position of the x - ray detection @xcite .    at this location",
    "there is also a bright and point - like object detected at 70@xmath1 m and 160@xmath1 m . in spite of the large beam used for the data at long wavelengthsm and 160@xmath1 m respectively . ] , the fact that the mid - ir counterpart of cxo ",
    "j1417 is two orders of magnitude brighter than any other galaxies detected at 24@xmath1 m in this area strongly suggests that this far - ir emission is also associated with the x - ray source .",
    "its fluxes in the mips 24/70/160@xmath1 m bands were measured via psf fitting .",
    "they are reported in table1 , which also summarizes the full multi - wavelength photometry of the object ( see @xcite for a description of our data set ) .",
    "optical and near - ir fluxes were measured within a 1-radius aperture centered at the position of cxo  j1417 . with the exception of the galex data where we believe that the emission is contaminated by a blue galaxy lying 1.4 to the south , our flux measurements refer exclusively to the component hosting the x - ray source .",

    "j1417 is illustrated in fig.3 .",
    "it has a very red continuum with a steep rise from the optical up to the mid - ir , and the rest - frame 1.6@xmath1 m `` bump '' usually associated with stellar populations @xcite is not detected @xcite .",
    "the lack of this stellar feature and the very strong hot - dust power - law emission that we observe at @xmath315@xmath1 m ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are characteristic of active nuclei ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "they reveal that the agn totally dominates the luminosity of cxo ",
    "j1417 at these short ir wavelengths .",
    "we explored in more detail the properties of this active nucleus by fitting the x - ray spectrum with a power - law intrinsically absorbed at @xmath0=1.15 and assuming a galactic extinction model .",
    "we derived a column density n@xmath28=1.13@xmath29@xmath410@xmath30@xmath20 and a photon index @xmath31=1.81@xmath32 , leading to an extinction - corrected luminosity l@xmath33=2.35@xmath34@xmath410@xmath35ergs@xmath9 . although the lack of significant extinction by the silicates at 9.7@xmath1 m and the non - detection of the 400ev iron k@xmath36 line indicate that it is not an extremely absorbed object , the x - ray data point therefore to a luminous agn characterized by substantial obscuration .",
    "this active nucleus is probably not the only source powering the bolometric luminosity of cxo  j1417 .",
    "although they are strongly diluted by the continuum emission from the agn , the mid - ir broad bands from the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) often seen in star - forming environments seem to be detected in our irs spectrum ( see fig.2b ) . assuming a power - law continuum superimposed with a typical pah template and leaving the redshift of the latter as a free parameter , we generated a series of simulated spectra that we compared to our data .",
    "the @xmath37 shows a clear minimum when the pah component is shifted to the distance of cxo ",
    "j1417 , which suggests that these features are detected with relatively good confidence=1.15 , the @xmath37 is reduced by a factor of @xmath32 with respect to its median value measured over a redshift range @xmath38 with @xmath39 . ] .",
    "furthermore , the far - infrared and submillimeter detections reveal a very luminous cold dust component typical of those observed in dusty star - forming galaxies ( see sect.4 ) . to quantify its contribution relative to the much warmer dust seen in the mid - ir , we decomposed the global ir sed beyond 1@xmath1 m into ( i ) a single modified black body where @xmath40 is the dust temperature and @xmath41 the dust emissitivity . ]",
    "accounting for the cold component , characterized by a temperature @xmath40@xmath340k and a dust emissivity @xmath41@xmath31.7 , and ( ii ) a combination of several blackbodies with temperatures ranging from 150k to  2000k and reproducing the warm dust emission ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "we derived 11000@xmath1 m integrated luminosities of 4.5@xmath410@xmath5l@xmath6 for each of these two components .",
    "this leads to a total ir luminosity l@xmath42=9.0@xmath180.4@xmath410@xmath5l@xmath6 , where the uncertainty is driven by the determination of the temperature and the emissivity of the cold dust emission .",
    "j1417 is also remarkably quiet in the radio .",
    "the spectral index ( @xmath36@xmath30.6 ) is typical of synchrotron emission from starbursts , though we can not exclude a flatter continuum because of the substantial uncertainty on the observed flux density at 1.4ghz . assuming the standard far - ir / radio correlation @xcite",
    ", we would infer an ir luminosity @xmath32.5@xmath4 lower than that implied by our fit of the cold dust component . as it has already been observed at low redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) this radio faintness could result from substantial free - free absorption in the interstellar medium of the galaxy .",
    "it could also be due to a synchrotron deficiency characteristic of a very recent episode of star formation @xcite .",
    "although the bolometric correction for luminous and strongly - absorbed x - ray sources has not been very well constrained so far , the obscuration toward cxo  j1417 is still reasonable enough to allow a fairly secure estimate of the total luminosity of the active nucleus in this object .",
    "comparison of the sed shown in fig.3 with typical agn templates ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicate that this bolometric luminosity should typically range between 1@xmath410@xmath5l@xmath6 and 3@xmath410@xmath5l@xmath6 .",
    "while the agn can thus power most of the hot dust detected in the system , it is not energetic enough to account also for the far - ir emission .",
    "we argue that the cold dust component is produced by a deeply enshrouded starburst in the host galaxy ( see also e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "j1417 could be therefore a high redshift analog of some nearby `` composite '' ulirgs where the contribution of the agn to the bolometric output is comparable to that of the star - forming activity @xcite .",
    "it could also be similar to other distant x - ray selected sources that were detected at long wavelengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though this far - ir emission has been sometimes assumed to originate from the active nucleus rather than star formation @xcite .",
    "assuming the calibration from @xcite , the ir luminosity of the cold component translates into a star - formation rate @xmath43@xmath3750m@xmath6yr@xmath9 .",
    "such enhanced levels of activity usually occur within embedded and very compact regions surrounding the cores of galaxies ( @xmath3100300pcs , @xcite ) .",
    "it is consistent with the absence of direct star formation signatures as inferred from our uv / optical photometry , as well as from the acs image taking into account the spatial resolution of the @xmath44 data ( i.e. , @xmath31kpc at @xmath0=1.15 ) .",
    "assuming a typical accretion efficiency @xmath45=0.1 @xcite , the luminosity of the agn in cxo ",
    "j1417 translates into a mass accretion rate d@xmath46/d@xmath47@xmath33.1m@xmath6yr@xmath9 .",
    "this is typical of quasars at @xmath0@xmath31 @xcite , but it is larger than the rates measured in sources experiencing similar levels of starburst activity such as the more distant scuba sources @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the bolometric luminosity of this object and the obscuration toward its nucleus suggest that the gas fueling and the accretion are occurring quite efficiently , probably close to the eddington limit . under this hypothesis we would derive a black hole mass of @xmath31.4@xmath410@xmath48m@xmath6 .",
    "this is typically an order of magnitude larger than the mass of the smbhs determined in the submillimeter galaxies , and it would be even larger in the case of a sub - eddington accretion .",
    "these properties suggest that cxo ",
    "j1417 is an object sharing characteristics with both starburst - dominated galaxies and quasars , where violent star formation is still happening while a massive black hole has already formed .",
    "high redshift ulirgs showing a mixture of star formation and agn such as cxo ",
    "j1417 could be interesting as tests of the evolutionary sequences that have been proposed to understand the connection between the two phenomena ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in such scenarios for instance , merging galaxies first trigger powerful star formation , and as material settles into the cores of these objects it feeds a supermassive black hole that eventually emerges as a luminous agn .",
    "the latter can then produce strong winds and outflows that feed energy back into the surrounding galaxy and may either quench or reactivate star formation ( @xcite ) . in the case of cxo ",
    "j1417 there is a dominant contribution of the nucleus in the near - ir and it is not clear whether an underlying bulge has already formed in the host galaxy .",
    "however , sources experiencing star formation and disk - accretion that both radiate a similar amount of energy throughout their lifetime would evolve toward massive galaxies that lie significantly out of the local `` @xmath49 '' relationship @xcite . although the starburst and the agn in cxo",
    " j1417 are characterized by roughly equal luminosities now , we infer that if these two phenomena evolve together they may occur on quite different time scales and regulate each other efficiently for the bulges and smbhs to grow in a coordinated manner",
    ".    such transitional cases might be rare locally ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . at higher redshift",
    "however , their importance relative to the infrared / submillimeter or x - ray selected objects where one type of activity ( i.e. , star formation or accretion ) largely dominates is not yet known .",
    "interestingly , cxo ",
    "j1417 lies at the knee of the 28kev luminosity function derived by @xcite at 0.8@xmath50@xmath0@xmath501.2 but it is much more ir - luminous than most of star - forming galaxies at this epoch of cosmic history @xcite .",
    "searching for similar objects at higher redshifts when ulirgs were a major component of the starbursting population @xcite should allow us to explore in more detail the role that this coexistence of agns and starbursts within galaxies played in shaping the present - day universe .",
    "even though their identification could be challenging , cxo ",
    "j1417 points to the type of evidence required for this goal .",
