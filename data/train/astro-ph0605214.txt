    "the standard friedmann  lematre  robertson  walker ( flrw ) approach to model the universe commences with two basic assumptions .",
    "first , it is postulated the existence of a cosmic time @xmath0 .",
    "second , it is assumed that our @xmath1dimensional space is homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "the most general spacetime metric consistent with these assumptions is @xmath2 \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 depending on the sign of the constant spatial curvature ( @xmath6 ) , and @xmath7 is the cosmological scale factor .",
    "the metric  ( [ rwmetric ] ) only expresses the above assumptions , and to proceed further in this geometrical approach to model the physical world , one needs a metrical theory of gravitation as , for example , general relativity ( gr ) , which we assume in this article , to study the dynamics of the universe .",
    "however , gr is a metrical ( local ) theory , which relates the matter content of the universe to its geometry . it does not specify the underlying spacetime manifold @xmath8 nor the corresponding spatial ( @xmath9constant ) section @xmath10",
    "this is the very first origin of the so - called cosmic topology in the context of the flrw cosmological modelling , and arises from the simple fact that geometry constrains but does not dictate topology ( see , e.g. , the review articles ref .  ) . to illustrate this fact in a very simple way , imagine a two - dimensional ( @xmath11d ) world and its beings .",
    "suppose further that these @xmath11d creatures have a ( @xmath12)spacetime geometrical theory of gravitation , and that modelling their universe in the framework of this theory they found that they live in a flat universe , i.e. that the @xmath11d spatial geometry is euclidean .",
    "this knowledge , however , does not give them enough information to determine the space topology of their world .",
    "indeed , besides the simply - connected euclidean plane @xmath13 , the space section of their universe can take either of the following multiply - connected space forms : the cylinder @xmath14 , the torus @xmath15 , the klein bottle @xmath16 and the mbius band @xmath17 .",
    "similarly in the flrw approach to model the our ( @xmath18)dimensional world , although the spatial section @xmath10 is usually taken to be one of the simply connected spaces : euclidean @xmath19 , spherical @xmath20 or hyperbolic @xmath21 , it is a mathematical result that the great majority of locally homogeneous and isotropic @xmath1spaces @xmath10 are multiply - connected manifolds , i.e. spaces with a nontrivial topology .",
    "thus , for example , in a universe whose geometry of the spatial section is euclidean ( @xmath22 ) , besides @xmath23 there are 10 classes of topologically distinct compact @xmath1spaces @xmath10 that admits this geometry , while for universes with either spherical ( @xmath24 ) and hyperbolic ( @xmath25 ) spatial geometries there is an infinite number of topologically inequivalent ( non - homeomorphic ) manifolds with non - trivial topology that can be endowed with these geometries .    in a flrw models the sign of the spatial curvature @xmath26 , and therefore the associated geometry ,",
    "is given by the total matter - energy density @xmath27 of the universe , through the friedmann equation in the form @xmath28 .. ] indeed , for @xmath29 the spatial section is positively curved ( spherical geometry ) , for @xmath30 it is flat ( @xmath22 ) , while for @xmath31 the section @xmath10 is negatively curved ( hyperbolic geometry ) . as a consequence , a key point in the search for the ( spatial ) geometry of the universe is to constrain the total density @xmath27 from observations . in the context of the @xmath32cdm model , which we assume in this article",
    ", this amounts to determining regions in the @xmath33@xmath34 parametric plane , which consistently account for the observations , and from which one expects to deduce the geometry of the universe .",
    "now given that the spatial geometry is an observable that constrains but does not determine the topology of the @xmath1space @xmath10 , two questions arise at this point , namely whether the topology is an observable , and , if so , to what extent it can be used to either determine the geometry or set constraints on the density parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 .    our main aims here , which are based upon and complementary to our previous works,@xcite@xcite ( see also refs .  )",
    "are twofold : first , we point out that a nontrivial topology of the spatial sections is as an observable attribute as local curvature , and can be probed for all homogeneous and isotropic universes with no assumption on the cosmological density parameters ; second , we demonstrate that the knowledge of the spatial topology allows to place constraints on the density parameters of the universe .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in the next section , to make the article as clear and self - contained as possible , we review a few topological results regarding @xmath1-manifolds , and give an account of the cosmological model employed . in section  [ mainres ] ,",
    "we discuss how one can use an observable nontrivial topology of the spatial section of the universe to set constraints on the cosmological density parameters , and present explicit examples of such bounds .",
    "within the framework of the standard flrw cosmology , the universe is modelled by a @xmath37-manifold @xmath8 which is decomposed into @xmath38 , and is endowed with a locally isotropic and homogeneous robertson  walker ( rw ) metric  ( [ rwmetric ] ) . the spatial section @xmath10 is usually taken to be one of the following simply - connected spaces : euclidean @xmath23 ( @xmath22 ) , spherical @xmath39 ( @xmath24 ) , or hyperbolic @xmath40 ( @xmath25 ) spaces . however , since geometry does not dictate topology , the @xmath1-space @xmath10 may equally well be any one of the possible quotient ( multiply - connected ) manifolds @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is a fixed - point free discrete group of isometries of the corresponding covering space @xmath19 , @xmath20 , or @xmath21 .",
    "quotient manifolds are compact in three independent directions with no boundary ( referred to , by mathematicians , as closed ) , or compact in two or at least one independent direction . the action of @xmath44 tiles the corresponding covering space @xmath19 , @xmath20 , or @xmath21 , into identical cells or domains which are copies of the so - called fundamental polyhedron ( fp ) .",
    "a fp plus the face identifications given by the group @xmath44 is a faithful representation of the quotient manifold @xmath10 .",
    "an example of quotient manifold in three dimensions is the flat @xmath1torus @xmath45 .",
    "the covering space clearly is @xmath19 , and a fp is a cube with opposite faces identified after a translation .",
    "this fp tiles the covering space @xmath19 .",
    "the group @xmath46 consists of discrete translations associated with the face identifications .    in a multiply - connected manifold ,",
    "any two given points may be joined by more than one geodesic .",
    "since the radiation emitted by cosmic sources follows geodesics , the immediate observational consequence of a detectable non - trivial spatial topology of @xmath10 is that the sky will show multiple images of either cosmic objects or specific spots of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) . at very large scales ,",
    "the existence of these multiple images ( or pattern repetitions ) is a physical effect that can be used to probe the @xmath1-space topology .",
    "we shall return to this point in the next section .",
    "an important topological length of the spherical and hyperbolic @xmath1manifolds @xmath10 is the so - called injectivity radius @xmath47 , which is nothing but the radius of the smallest sphere ` inscribable ' in @xmath10 , and can be formally defined in terms of the length of the smallest closed geodesics @xmath48 by @xmath49 ( for details on the formal definition of @xmath50 see , e.g. , ref .  ) .    motivated by the best fit value of the total density @xmath51 ( @xmath52 level ) reported by wmap team,@xcite which includes a positively curved universe as a realistic possibility , in this work we focus our attention in globally homogeneous spherical manifolds , of which we shall recall some relevant results in what follows .",
    "the multiply connected spherical @xmath1-manifolds are of the form @xmath53 , where @xmath44 is a finite fixed - point free subgroup of @xmath54 .",
    "these manifolds were originally classified in ref .",
    "( for a description in the context of cosmic topology see the pioneering article by ellis@xcite ) .",
    "such a classification consists essentially in the enumeration of all finite groups @xmath55 , and then in grouping the possible manifolds in classes . in a recent paper,@xcite the classification has been recast in terms of single action , double action , and linked action manifolds .",
    "single action manifolds are globally homogeneous , and then satisfy a topological principle of ( global ) homogeneity , in the sense that all points in @xmath10 share the same topological properties . in table",
    "[ singleaction ] we list the single action manifolds together with the symbol we use to refer to them , the covering groups @xmath44 and their order as well as the corresponding injectivity radius @xmath47 .",
    "finally we note that the binary icosahedral group @xmath56 gives rise to the known poincar dodecahedral space @xmath57 , whose fundamental polyhedron ( fp ) is a regular spherical dodecahedron , @xmath58 of which tile the @xmath1-sphere into identical cells which are copies of the fp .",
    "an important point regarding the spherical manifolds is that the injectivity radius @xmath47 expressed in _ units of the curvature radius _ ( terms that we define below ) is a constant ( topological invariant ) for a given manifold @xmath10 .",
    "let us examine now our cosmological assumptions regarding the cosmic constituents , and discuss the chief point in the search for the ( spatial ) geometry of the universe . in the light of current observations , we assume that the current matter content of the universe is well approximated by cold dark matter ( cdm ) of density @xmath59 plus a cosmological constant @xmath32 .",
    "the friedmann equation is then given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the hubble parameter and @xmath62 is newton s constant . introducing @xmath63 equation  ( [ feq ] ) gives @xmath64 where clearly @xmath65 . as we have mentioned in the introduction , eq .",
    "( [ friedmann ] ) makes transparent that the spatial geometry of the universe depend on whether the density parameters determine points @xmath66 that lie in the regions below ( hyperbolic geometry ) , above ( spherical geometry ) , or on the flat line @xmath67 ( euclidean geometry ) .    to conclude this section",
    ", we note that for non - flat metrics of the form  ( [ rwmetric ] ) , the scale factor @xmath7 can be identified with the curvature radius of the spatial section of the universe at time @xmath68 , which from  ( [ friedmann ] ) is clearly given by @xmath69 , where the subscript @xmath70 denotes evaluation at present time @xmath71 .",
    "thus , for non - euclidian spatial geometries the distance @xmath72 of any point with coordinates @xmath73 to the origin in _ units of the curvature radius _ , @xmath74 , is given by @xmath75 in this paper we measure the lengths in unit of curvature radius @xmath76 .",
    "given that the spatial geometry is an observable that constrains but does not dictate the topology of the @xmath1space @xmath10 , two questions arise at this point : whether the topology is an observable , and , if so , whether it can be used to set constraints on the density parameters associated with dark matter ( @xmath35 ) and dark energy ( @xmath36 ) . regarding the former , over the past few years many strategies and methods to probe a nontrivial spatial of the @xmath1dimensional space , by using either discrete cosmic sources or cmbr , have been devised ( besides the review articles refs .",
    "see also , e.g. , refs .   and references therein ) .",
    "to make clear that a nontrivial spatial topology is as an observable attribute as the local curvature , we shall focus on the so - called  circles - in - the - sky \" method , which relies on multiple copies of correlated circles in the cmbr maps,@xcite and can be briefly described as follows . in a space with a detectable non - trivial topology , the last scattering sphere ( lss )",
    "intersects some of its topological images along pairs of circles of equal radii , centered at different points on lss , with the same distribution of temperature fluctuations , @xmath77 .",
    "since the mapping from the lss to the night sky sphere preserves circles,@xcite these pairs of matching circles will be inprinted on the cmbr temperature fluctuations sky maps regardless of the background geometry and detectable topology . as a consequence , to observationally probe a non - trivial topology one should scrutinize the full - sky cmbr anisotropy maps in order to extract the correlated circles , whose angular radii and relative position of centers can be used to determine the spatial topology of the universe .",
    "thus , a non - trivial topology of the space section of the universe is an observable , and can be probed , through the circles - in - the - sky , for all locally homogeneous and isotropic universes with no assumption on the cosmological density parameters .    regarding the question as to whether this observable can be used to set constraints on the density parameters , we first recall that it is known that the topology of a constant curvature @xmath1dimensional manifold determines the sign of its curvature ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "thus , the topology of the spatial section @xmath10 dictates its geometry . at first sight",
    "this seems to indicate that the detection of the spatial topology gives rise to very loose constraints on both density parameters , since it only determines whether they take values in the regions below , above , or on the flat line @xmath78 .",
    "however , in what follows we show that the knowledge of spatial topology through the  circles - in - the - sky \" gives rise to very remarkable constraints on the density parameters allowed by other observational data sets .    motivated by the best fit value of the total density @xmath79 ( @xmath52 level ) reported by wmap team,@xcite which includes a positively curved universe as a realistic possibility",
    ", we consider here examples of globally homogeneous spherical manifolds , which we have discussed in the previous section .",
    "one of these topologically homogeneous spaces is the poincar dodecahedral space @xmath57 , which has been suggested by luminet _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite as a possible explanation for the observed anomalous power of the low multipoles,@xcite and since then it has been the scope of further investigations@xcite@xcite ( for alternative studies of the missing wide - angle correlations see , e.g. , ref .   ) .    in ref .   a systematic study of the cmbr anysotropy in the spherical globally homogeneous spaces has been made",
    "they have found that @xmath57 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 out of infinitely many manifolds account for the suppression of power at large scales observed by wmap,@xcite and also fit the wmap temperature two - point correlation function .",
    "but , for the total density @xmath82 restricted to the wmap interval ( 1.00 , 1.04 ] , the space @xmath81 is excluded since it requires a value of @xmath82 outside this interval . on the other hand , more recently they have carried out a detailed search for the circles - in - the - sky in these three manifolds,@xcite but due to noise and foreground composition , only a non - conclusive indication for the correlated circles has been reported for the spaces @xmath57 and @xmath81 . here",
    "we restrict our examples to the flrw models with spatial section @xmath81 .    in globally homogeneous spherical @xmath1spaces",
    "the matching circles have to be antipodal , i.e. the centers of correlated circles are separated by @xmath83 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ cinthesky1 ] .",
    "clearly the distance between the centers of each pair of the _ first _ correlated circles is twice the injectivity radius @xmath47 .",
    "now , a straightforward use of trigonometric relations ( known as napier s rules ) for the right - angled spherical triangle shown in fig .  [ cinthesky1 ]",
    "yields @xmath84 \\ ; , % \\cos \\alpha = \\frac{\\tan r_{inj}}{\\tan \\chi^{}_{lss } } \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is a topological invariant , whose values are given in table  [ singleaction ] , and the distance @xmath85 of the last scattering surface to the origin in units of the curvature radius is given by  ( [ redshift - dist ] ) with @xmath86.@xcite    # 1#20.45#1    equation  ( [ chilss ] ) along with ( [ redshift - dist ] ) give the relation between the angular radius @xmath87 and the cosmological density parameters @xmath36 and @xmath88 , and thus can be used to set constraints on these parameters . to quantify this we proceed in the following way .",
    "firstly , as an example , we assume the angular radius @xmath89 . secondly , since the measurements of the radius @xmath87 unavoidably involve observational uncertainties , in order to obtain very conservative results we take @xmath90 . and @xmath91 .",
    "however , our general conclusions hold regardless of the precise value for @xmath87 and its uncertainty . ]    to illustrate the role of the cosmic topology in constraining the density parameters @xmath33 and @xmath92 , we consider the binary tetrahedral @xmath81 as the spatial topology to reanalyze ( with this topological prior ) the constraints on the density parameters taking into account two data sets .",
    "first , the so - called _ gold _ sample of 157 sne ia , as compiled by riess _ _ et al.__@xcite second , the _ gold _ sample along with the chandra measurements of the x - ray gas mass fraction in 26 x - ray luminous , dynamically relaxed galaxy clusters provided by allen _",
    "et al._@xcite the @xmath81 spatial topology is added to the conventional data analysis as a gaussian prior on the value of @xmath85 , which can be easily obtained from a elementary combination of  ( [ chilss ] ) along with  ( [ redshift - dist ] ) .",
    "figure  [ top+snia ] shows the results of our joint sne ia plus cosmic topology analysis .",
    "there we display the confidence regions ( 68.3% , and 95.4% confidence level , c.l . ) in the parametric plane @xmath33@xmath34 and also the regions from the conventional analysis .",
    "the comparison between these regions makes clear that the effect of the @xmath81 topology as a new cosmological observable is to reduce considerably the area corresponding to the confidence intervals in the parametric plane as well as to break degeneracies arising from the current sne ia measurements . for a detail study of the role play by the globally homogeneous topologies @xmath57 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , we refer the ref .",
    "@xcite .    #",
    "1#20.45#1    -0.2 cm    figure  [ statanalysis ] shows the results of our joint sne ia+x - ray plus topology analysis .",
    "confidence regions ( 68.3% and 95.4% c.l . ) in the parametric space @xmath33@xmath92 are displayed .",
    "for the sake of comparison , we also show in the left panel the density parametric plane for the conventional sne ia plus galaxy clusters analysis ( without the cosmic topology assumption ) . by comparing these analyses ,",
    "it is clear that again for these data sets the @xmath81 non - trivial space topology reduces considerably the parametric space region allowed by the current observational data , and breaks some degeneracies arising from the current sne ia and x - ray gas mass fraction measurements .",
    "the best - fit parameters for this sne ia+x - ray+topology analysis provides @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 .    concerning the above analyses it is worth emphasizing three important features .",
    "first , that the best - fit values are just weakly dependent on the value used for the angular radius @xmath87 of the circle .",
    "second , the uncertainty @xmath91 alters predominantly the area of the confidence regions , without having a significant effect on the best - fit values .",
    "third , there is a topological degeneracy in that the same best fits and confidence regions for the @xmath81 topology , would arise from either @xmath96 or @xmath97 topology .",
