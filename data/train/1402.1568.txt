    "electromagnetic radiation has a long history as an excellent probe in high energy nuclear collisions .",
    "the long mean free path of photons and dileptons , an order of magnitude larger than the transverse size of the colliding nuclei , allows them to carry information from the earliest stages of the collision and from deep inside the fireball to the detector systems .",
    "over the years , several distinct sources of direct photons have been identified and calculated .",
    "they include ( i ) prompt photons from initial hard processes between beam partons and from jet fragmentation @xcite , ( ii ) pre - equilibrium photons from the secondary scatterings between partons before the system thermalizes @xcite , ( iii ) photons from jets interacting with qgp @xcite , ( iv ) thermal radiation from equilibrated or near - equilibrium quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite , ( v ) photons associated with the hadronization process @xcite , and finally ( vi ) thermal photons from the hot hadronic gas phase @xcite .",
    "these direct photons have to be experimentally separated from a large amount of background photons from hadronic decays ( most notably from neutral pions ) .",
    "thermal photons , dominant at low transverse momenta @xmath1 , are supposed to act as a thermometer of the hot nuclear matter , and there is mounting evidence that the early temperatures extracted are above the critical temperature @xmath2 expected for the phase transition to quark gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "photons from interactions of jets with qgp carry important complementary information .",
    "hence it is critical to experimentally separate the contributions from different photon sources as much as possible so each can be analyzed appropriately .",
    "the list of photon sources in the previous paragraph follows a rough hierarchy of typical transverse momenta of the source , from high to low @xmath1 .",
    "jet - medium photons have been shown to make significant contributions at intermediate @xmath1 around @xmath3 gev/@xmath4 in single inclusive photon spectra both at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , but they compete with prompt hard photons at larger @xmath1 and thermal and pre - equilibrium photons at smaller @xmath1 . hence it has been hard to confirm their existence from measurements of single inclusive photon spectra alone , much less to exploit their properties .",
    "elliptic flow of jet - medium photons had been predicted to be negative and it was expected to serve as a telltale signature @xcite .",
    "however experimental studies of direct photon @xmath5 have not been able to bring conclusive evidence for the existence of jet - medium photons @xcite .    in this work",
    "we propose to use the correlation of large momentum photons with jets in the opposite direction to measure the strength of a part of the jet - medium photon source , more precisely the photons from back - scattering kinematics .",
    "we will argue that this effectively rids the sample of photons from thermal and pre - equilibrium sources and vastly reduces the background from jet fragmentation photons .",
    "furthermore , energy loss of the parent parton should shift back - scattering photons toward smaller momenta , exposing them compared to the remaining background source of prompt hard photons which are not affected by parton energy loss . on the other hand ,",
    "energy loss of the trigger jet , and the experimental uncertainty measuring jet energies tend to wash out the signal from back - scattering photons .",
    "we will discuss these effects in detail below .",
    "great opportunity awaits us if we successfully measure the strength of the back - scattering process . besides having a complementary measure of parton energy loss independent of hadronic measurements ( quarks will lose energy before converting into photons )",
    ", one could measure the temperature of the medium ( @xmath6 mev ) independently using back - scatter photons with energies of tens of gev .",
    "jet - medium photons have most notably been calculated in two limits : as electromagnetic bremsstrahlung to jet quenching @xcite , e.g.  in the arnold - moore and yaffe ( amy ) approach , and as an elastic back scattering process @xcite .",
    "the latter is based on the fact that @xmath7 compton and annihilation scattering with a photon in the final state , @xmath8 and @xmath9 both have a sharp peak at backward angles .",
    "in other words , when a fast quark annihilates with a slow antiquark , or compton scatters off a slow gluon from the thermal medium , in most of the cases ( compton ) or in about half the cases ( annihilation ) the photon created carries approximately the momentum of the fast quark .",
    "back - scattering processes of this type are well known and are exploited in numerous ways , e.g.  to create high energy photon beams . in photon beam facilities",
    "laser photons ( typically @xmath10 ev ) are compton back - scattered from a high energy electron beam ( in the mev to gev range ) to create collimated beams of mev to gev photons @xcite .",
    "the qcd compton analogue that we use here consists of a thermal gluon ( @xmath11 mev ) scattering off a quark ( @xmath12 gev ) to produce a @xmath12 gev photon .",
    "both bremsstrahlung and back - scattering calculations are often carried out in a leading parton approximation to jets in a medium @xcite however more general calculations using the parton dynamics inside a jet shower in a medium have recently become available @xcite .",
    "in ref .  @xcite the rate of compton and annihilation processes between one parton from a set of fast quarks subject to energy loss , and another from a fireball with a temperature profile @xmath13 was calculated in the backward peak approximation ( @xmath14 ) to be @xmath15    \\left [ \\ln \\frac{3e_\\gamma } { \\alpha_s\\pi t(x ) } + c\\right],\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 . here",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 are the electromagnetic and strong coupling constant respectively .",
    "@xmath19 is the phase space distribution of fast quarks interacting with the medium and @xmath20 is the electric charge of a quark with the index @xmath21 running over all active quark flavors .",
    "this formula is easily generalized to the rate of photons associated with a trigger jet whose energy , pseudorapidity and relative azimuthal angle , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , fall within a trigger window @xmath25 in @xmath22-@xmath23-@xmath24 space .",
    "for the latter we replace the single inclusive parton distribution @xmath26 by the parton - jet pair distribution integrated over @xmath25 , @xmath27 here @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the position and momentum of the quark at the time of the back scattering and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the original position and momentum when the quark was created in a hard process .",
    "propagation is assumed to be along straight lines in the direction of @xmath29 with the speed of light , i.e. @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 is the energy lost between @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "straight line propagation implies that @xmath36 is collinear with the original momentum of the quark .",
    "similarly @xmath37 is the energy lost by the trigger jet in the medium .",
    "@xmath37 will strongly depend on the cone size chosen in the experimental reconstruction of the jet .",
    "@xmath38 is the spin and color degeneracy factor of quarks and @xmath39 is the density of nucleon - nucleon collisions in the transverse plane .",
    "we have to consider the background from prompt hard photons and fragmentation photons with an awayside jet in the same trigger window @xmath25 .",
    "we will not consider trigger windows with jet @xmath22 smaller than 20 gev .",
    "the pre - equilibrium and thermal photons do not possess back - to back correlation with an away - side jet , hence can be eliminated from the background .",
    "we can thus compute the nuclear modification factor @xmath40 of photons with an awayside high energy trigger jet as : @xmath41 where @xmath42 as usual is the total number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "our calculation comprises two stages . at the first stage",
    "we calculate the background ( prompt hard and fragmentation ) photon and parton ( prior to back - scattering ) cross sections at leading order ( lo ) or next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in @xmath18 in the code jetphox ( version 1.2.2 ) @xcite",
    ". the default will be lo cross sections unless explicitly stated otherwise .",
    "we use cteq6 m @xcite parton distributions for protons and eps09 modifications for nuclei @xcite in jetphox .    for the second stage we use the code package ppm @xcite to calculate ( i ) the energy loss of partons , ( ii ) the energy loss of jets , and ( iii ) the back - scattering photon rate according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : master ] ) .",
    "ppm propagates partons and jets ( represented by their leading parton ) through a fireball model .",
    "here this is done pairwise , i.e.  photon - jet pairs and quark - jet pairs propagate from their point of creation though a hard parton - parton scattering .",
    "the spatial distribution @xmath39 of hard processes is given by the nucleon - nucleon collision density from a glauber calculation .",
    "for photon - jet pairs the energy loss of the jet due to its path through the medium is calculated , and all photon - jet pairs with a final jet energy within @xmath25 are counted as part of the background .",
    "we do not take into account energy loss of partons before fragmentation into photons which will lead to a lower bound for the signal to background ratio .",
    "if energy loss of partons for photon fragmentation were taken into account in addition , it would help to suppress the fragmentation background at high photon-@xmath43 where @xmath43 is the momentum fraction of the parent parton carried by the photon .",
    "for quark - jet pairs the energy loss of the jet and of the parton are computed while the back - scattering probability of the parton is also computed along the way .",
    "all final photons from this source which lie in @xmath25 are counted as part of the photon signal .",
    "our fireball model describes a longitudinally expanding , boost - invariant qgp phase .",
    "the transverse profile of the entropy density is fixed by the participant density of nucleons from a glauber calculation .",
    "we do not expect our main conclusions to change much if transverse expansion or fluctuations in the fireball are taken into account .",
    "the normalization of the entropy density is fixed by data from rhic @xcite and scaled up to describe multiplicity data in pb+pb collisions at the lhc .",
    "we use a relativistic ideal gas equation of state for 3 light quark flavors to calculate the temperature needed in the photon conversion formula .",
    "this procedure will slightly underestimates the real temperature and thus the photon production rate at a given value of the entropy density @xmath44 , in particular close to the pseudo - critical temperature @xmath2 .",
    "the energy loss of quarks and gluons is calculated from a simple lpm - inspired approximation ( called slpm in ref .",
    "@xcite ) which uses @xmath45 where the value of @xmath46 is proportional to the local entropy density @xmath44 of the fireball at that space - time point .",
    "the proportionality constant is fitted to simultaneously describe rhic and lhc data on single inclusive hadron suppression . despite its simplicity ,",
    "this model describes basic features of high momentum hadron production at rhic reasonably well @xcite .",
    "the resulting initial value of @xmath47 gev@xmath48/fm in the center of au+au collisions at rhic energy is consistent with recent findings of the jet collaboration @xcite .",
    "jet energy loss is much less under theoretical control .",
    "a consistent calculation can only be done with a full jet shower simulation in the medium , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "here we choose a simple model of the path length and energy dependence to reproduce gross features of jet energy loss .",
    "we parameterize that the energy loss ( i.e.  the amount of energy outside of a given jet cone ) is proportional to path length , and we add a small energy dependence , @xmath49 where @xmath50 gev .",
    "@xmath51 is proportional to the local entropy density @xmath44 as in the case of leading parton energy loss.the linear path length dependence appears more appropriate both for the stochastic process of stripping partons off the jet cone as the jet goes through the medium , and for the large angle radiation with short formation times that plays a role as well .",

    "we also show the data from star , alice and cms that use rather small jet cone radii of 0.4 , 0.2 and 0.4 , respectively . without a full jet shower simulation we can not make a rigorous connection between jet cone radius , jet quenching , and jet @xmath40",
    ". rather we will present our results using a set of different values of `` raa '' ( and thus @xmath51 ) . as can be seen from the figure the lowest values of raa for both rhic ( 0.7 ) and lhc ( 0.5 ) roughly correspond to the suppression seen in current data with small cone radii . with improving jet reconstruction techniques and larger jet cone radii larger values of `` raa ''",
    "might become feasible .",
    "small jet cones in heavy ion experiments are mostly dictated by the relatively large background that needs to be subtracted .",

    "we define the away - side as an angle between 165 and 195 degrees in relative azimuthal angle .",
    "let us briefly discuss the choice of trigger window .",
    "the yield of single - inclusive back - scattering photons falls faster with @xmath1 than prompt hard photons ( similar to a higher twist contribution in perturbative qcd ) , thus the signal will become stronger with smaller @xmath1 .",

    "fragmentation photons generally provide a low - level background just below the trigger window ( they correspond to very high-@xmath43 photons ) .",
    "we use bfg - ii fragmentation function for photons @xcite .",
    "the kinematic range of back - scattering photons ( the signal ) calculated under the same assumptions ( lo , raa 1.0 ) and without energy loss of partons , coincide with those of prompt hard photons , as expected , although their strength is lower by about an order of magnitude .",
    "if parton energy loss is switched on with parameters determined from single hadron suppression , the back - scattering signal develops a shoulder of about 4 gev width , indicating that quarks have lost up to 4 gev of energy before conversion to photons .",
    "this pushes some back - scattering photon strength into the region of fragmentation photons which makes for a much better signal / background ratio just below the trigger window .",
    "if jet energy loss is taken into account in addition , with cone radii currently available ( raa 0.7 ) , both the hard prompt photon background and the back - scattering photon spectra become slightly more diffuse and tend to be shifted to higher @xmath1 since a trigger jet measured between 30 - 35 gev might have originated as a jet with larger energy .",
    "the jet triggered photon spectra thus carry fairly obvious information about the energy loss of partons and trigger jets in their broadening around the trigger window .",
    "these strong kinematic correlations are washed out by nlo corrections to the hard process in which another hard parton can be emitted in the final state .",

    "our calculation of back - scattering photons in its current form is not suitable to deal with radiative corrections as it is not clear how to treat medium induced radiation of a collinear pair of quarks that would end up in the same jet cone .",
    "however our results seem to indicate that the decorrelation of the signal with the trigger window that comes from radiative corrections to the hard process is generally weaker than the decorrelation that is induced by parton and trigger jet energy loss .",
    "this is even more the case at lhc energies where energy loss is large .",

    "the difference between the @xmath40 with and without inclusion of signal , is the signature for jet - triggered back - scattering photons .",
    "let us understand the key features of @xmath40 .",
    "first , we note that the nuclear modification factor of background photons ( i.e.  background photons in a+a vs background photons in @xmath61 ) is not around 1 .",
    "this is because background photons at rhic probe hard processes with quarks in the initial wave function . in a+a those processes",
    "are suppressed due to the larger fraction of @xmath62 valence quarks compared to @xmath63 valence quarks in nuclei and their smaller electric charge .",
    "we notice that trigger jet energy loss can lead to suppression of @xmath40 in the trigger window due to the shift of strength of background photons to larger energies .",
    "in fact the width of such a dip is related to the size of the typical jet energy loss .",
    "the signal of back - scattering photons on the other hand creates an enhancement in @xmath40 which is peaked just below the trigger window .",
    "both the dips in the background and the enhancement due to the signal are typical effects that will also appear at lhc .",

    "our proof - of - principle calculation could be improved in several ways .",
    "a full jet shower monte - carlo would remove the need for a leading parton approximation .",
    "it could also mimic nlo kinematics which we have only employed when final state effects leading to energy loss is absent since no consistent theory is available in that case .",
    "one could consider the use of high-@xmath1 trigger hadrons instead of trigger jets .",
    "they will be subject to the parton energy loss and jet energy loss which leads to smearing of the back - to - back energy correlation as discussed in the jet - photon case .",

    "<S> high energy photons created from back - scattering of jets in quark gluon plasma are a valuable probe of the temperature of the plasma , and of the energy loss mechanism of quarks in the plasma . </S>",
    "<S> an unambiguous identification of these photons through single inclusive photon measurements and photon azimuthal anisotropies has so far been elusive . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the spectra of back - scattering photons in coincidence with trigger jets for typical kinematic situations at the large hadron collider and the relativistic heavy ion collider . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the separation of back - scattering photons from other photon sources using trigger jets depends crucially on our ability to reliably estimate the initial trigger jet energy . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate that jet reconstruction techniques in heavy ion experiments need to be able to get to jet @xmath0 in central collisions for viable back - scattering signals . </S>"
