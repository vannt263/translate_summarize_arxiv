    "the behavior of confined , bose - einstein condensed atoms under rotation has been studied extensively in recent years , both experimentally @xcite , as well as theoretically .",
    "one factor which is very crucial in these studies is the form of the confinement . in most of the experiments performed on cold gases of atoms ,",
    "the trapping potential is harmonic .",
    "it is interesting , however , that the harmonic trapping is special in many respects , as we show below . for this reason recent theoretical studies",
    "@xcite , as well as the experiment of ref.@xcite , have considered traps with other functional forms , in which the trapping potential grows more rapidly than quadratically at distances far away from the center of the cloud .",
    "such trapping potentials introduce many novel phases .    motivated by this observation",
    ", we examine the lowest state of a bose - einstein condensate in a rotating anharmonic trap . up to now , all theoretical studies that have been performed on this problem were based upon the mean - field approximation .",
    "however , especially in the case of effective attractive interactions between the atoms @xcite , the use of the mean - field approximation is questionable , as we explain in more detail below . in this study",
    ", we present  exact \" results  for small numbers of atoms  from numerical diagonalization of the hamiltonian , which goes beyond the mean - field approximation .",
    "experimentally it is possible to tune both the frequency of rotation of the trap , as well as the strength of the interatomic interaction . motivated by these facts ,",
    "we consider here a fixed trapping potential and examine the various phases and the corresponding phase diagram as function of the rotational frequency and of the coupling .    in",
    "what follows we present our model in sec.ii . in sec.iii",
    "we discuss the general structure of the phase diagram .",
    "in sec.iv we describe the details of the numerical diagonalization . in secs.v and",
    "vi we present and analyze our results for effective repulsive and attractive interatomic interactions , respectively .",
    "finally , in sec.vii we summarize our main results .",
    "the hamiltonian that we consider consists of the single - particle part @xmath0 , and of the interaction @xmath1 , which is taken to be of the form of a contact potential , @xmath2 , @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the number of atoms , and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the scattering length for elastic atom - atom collisions , and @xmath7 is the atom mass . the single - particle part of the hamiltonian has the usual form @xmath8 where the trap is assumed to be symmetric around the @xmath9 axis .",
    "this is also taken to be the axis of rotation . in cylindrical coordinates @xmath10 , and @xmath9 , @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the trap frequency of the harmonic part of @xmath13 , @xmath14 is a dimensionless constant which is the coefficient of the anharmonic term in @xmath13 ( taken to be much smaller than unity in this study , as is also the case in the experiment of ref.@xcite ) , and @xmath15 is the oscillator length . along the @xmath9 axis",
    "we assume that the trapping potential @xmath16 is sufficiently strong that the typical separation between single - particle energy levels is much larger than the typical interaction energy .",
    "this assumption implies that the motion along the @xmath9 axis is frozen out and our problem is essentially two - dimensional .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , motivated by the experimental situation , we here examine the phase diagram as function of the rotational frequency @xmath17 of the trap and of the strength of the interaction .",
    "it is natural to measure @xmath17 in units of @xmath12 and the strength of the interaction @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the atomic density , in units of the oscillator energy @xmath20 .",
    "the corresponding dimensionless ratio @xmath21 is @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the density per unit length . here",
    "@xmath24 is the width of the atomic cloud along the @xmath9 axis .",
    "it is instructive to first consider the general structure of the phase diagram @xcite .",
    "this consists of several distinct phases .",
    "let us start with repulsive interactions , @xmath25 .",
    "for a fixed @xmath17 , as @xmath26 increases , the total energy eventually becomes dominated by the interaction energy , which is minimized via the formation of singly quantized vortex states .",
    "this is similar to vortex formation in liquid helium , or in harmonically trapped gases .    on the other hand , for a constant interaction strength , as the rotational frequency increases  and",
    "the single - particle part is the dominant part of the hamiltonian  the total energy of the gas is minimized via formation of multiply quantized vortices .",
    "this is most easily seen if one thinks of the effective potential felt by the atoms , which consists of @xmath13 minus the centrifugal potential , @xmath27 for the form of @xmath13 we have considered , @xmath28 takes the form of a mexican - hat shape for @xmath29 , and thus the atoms prefer to reside along the bottom of this potential .",
    "this is precisely the density distribution that corresponds to multiply - quantized vortex states . from eq.([eff ] ) it is also clear that for harmonic trapping , @xmath30 , @xmath17 can not exceed @xmath12 , since the atoms will fly apart . for any other potential that grows more rapidly than @xmath31 at large distances ,",
    "the effective potential is bounded , independently of @xmath17 . finally , when both @xmath32 and @xmath33 are sufficiently large , there is a third , mixed phase consisting of a multiply - quantized vortex state at the center of the cloud , surrounded by singly - quantized vortices .",
    "this configuration in a sense compromises between the single - particle energy and the interaction energy .    turning to the case of effective attractive interactions , @xmath34 , for small enough @xmath35 , the phase diagram is , crudely speaking , symmetric with respect to @xmath26 .",
    "the lowest state of the gas is determined by the single - particle part of the hamiltonian , and thus the corresponding state still consists of multiply quantized vortex states .",
    "for higher values of @xmath35 , these states are again unstable against the formation of a combination of multiply quantized and singly quantized vortices , as in the mixed phase described for positive @xmath26 .",
    "the only difference is that the single - particle density distribution resembles that of a localized `` blob '' rotating around the minimum of the effective potential @xmath36 @xcite . for even higher values of @xmath35 , the phase that minimizes",
    "the energy is that of the center of mass excitation first seen in harmonically trapped atoms @xcite . in this phase",
    "the angular momentum is carried by the center of mass .",
    "the single - particle density distribution resembles that of the  mixed \" phase ( i.e. , a localized blob ) , although the structure of the many - body wavefunction is very different .",
    "finally , for sufficiently large values of @xmath35 the gas collapses @xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows a schematic phase diagram .",
    "as mentioned earlier , in the present study we perform numerical diagonalization of the hamiltonian for a given atom number @xmath4 and angular momentum @xmath37 . to achieve this",
    ", we first solve the single - particle eigenvalue problem numerically , @xmath38 using the numerov method .",
    "the eigenfunctions and eigenenergies are characterized by two quantum numbers , the number of radial nodes @xmath39 , and the number of quanta of angular momentum @xmath40 . making the simplified assumption of weak interactions , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "states with @xmath43 or negative @xmath40 are higher in energy by a term of order @xmath20 .",
    "this assumption allows us to consider relatively large values of @xmath4 and @xmath44 .",
    "one should remember that while for repulsive interactions @xmath26 can have any value , for attractive interactions , @xmath45 , as otherwise the system collapses .",
    "therefore , the lowest landau level approximation is more restrictive for repulsive interactions , yet it gives a rather good description of the various phases , even in this case .",
    "having found the single - particle eigenstates , we then set up the fock states , which are the eigenstates of the number operator @xmath46 and of the total angular momentum @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "as a final step we set up the corresponding hamiltonian matrix between the various fock states , which we diagonalize numerically .",
    "the diagonal matrix elements consist both of the single - particle part , as well as the interaction .",
    "the only non - zero off - diagonal matrix elements result from the interaction .",
    "the output of the hamiltonian gives us not only the lowest state , but the whole energy spectrum . since our calculation is performed for fixed angular momentum , in order to work with a fixed @xmath17 we consider the energy in the rotating frame , which is given by the usual transformation @xmath48 having found the many - body eigenstates and eigenvalues for some range of @xmath44 , then for a fixed @xmath17 we identify the eigenstate with the lowest eigenenergy according to eq.([transf ] ) .",
    "the many - body eigenfunction that corresponds to the lowest eigenenergy  which is expressed in terms of the fock states  is then analyzed in terms of the occupancy of the single particle states .",
    "the calculation of the occupancies is a trivial operation and , remarkably , each of the phases described in the previous section is characterized by a distinct distribution .",
    "this fact provides indisputable evidence for the phases we expect to get from the arguments of the previous section and from the predictions of mean - field .     from refs.@xcite .",

    "it should also be mentioned that the phase boundary between the mixed phase and the one of center of mass excitation lies much lower than the one calculated variationally in ref.@xcite .",
    "the reason is that the phase boundary of ref.@xcite ( for these two specific phases ) is just an upper bound , and the present calculation is consistent with this fact .",
    "finally , the unstable phase @xcite also shows up in our model .",

    "this result is inconsistent with the assumption of weak interactions , @xmath116 , as the approximation of lowest landau level breaks down . to get a quantitatively accurate description of this instability one would have to include higher landau levels .",
    "to summarize , in the present study we considered bosonic atoms that rotate in an anharmonic trap .",
    "we attacked this problem with the method of numerical diagonalization of the hamiltonian , which goes beyond the mean - field approximation but also forced us to consider small numbers of atoms . apart from the assumption of weak interatomic interactions , our results are exact .",
