    "<S> a relativistic helicity has been formulated in the four - dimensional minkowski space - time . whereas the relativistic distortion of space - time violates the conservation of the conventional helicity , the newly defined relativistic helicity conserves in a barotropic fluid or plasma , dictating a fundamental topological constraint . </S>",
    "<S> the relation between the helicity and the vortex - line topology has been delineated by analyzing the linking number of vortex filaments which are singular differential forms representing the pure states of banach algebra . while the dimension of space - time is four , vortex filaments link , because vorticities are primarily 2-forms and the corresponding 2-chains link in four dimension ; the relativistic helicity measures the linking number of vortex filaments that are proper - time cross - sections of the vorticity 2-chains . </S>",
    "<S> a thermodynamic force yields an additional term in the vorticity , by which the vortex filaments on a reference - time plane are no longer pure states . </S>",
    "<S> however , the vortex filaments on a proper - time plane remain to be pure states , if the thermodynamic force is exact ( barotropic ) , thus , the linking number of vortex filaments conserves . </S>"
