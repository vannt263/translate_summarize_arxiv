    "[ int ]    in this paper we describe certain homology groups , for complex projective and one - dimensional quasi - projective manifolds .",
    "these _ polar homology  _ groups can be regarded as a complex geometric counterpart of singular homology groups in topology .",
    "the essence of the  polar homology \" theory described below is presented in the following  complexification dictionary \" : @xmath1    in short , polar @xmath0-chains in a complex projective manifold are linear combinations of @xmath0-dimensional complex submanifolds with meromorphic closed @xmath0-forms on them .",
    "the boundary operator sends such a pair _",
    "( complex submanifold , meromorphic form )   to the pair _ ( form s divisor of poles , form s residue at the divisor ) ,   that is , to a @xmath2-chain in the same ambient manifold .",
    "the square of the boundary operator is zero , and the polar homology groups are defined as the quotients of polar cycles over polar boundaries , see section [ formal ] . _",
    "_    while the form s divisor of poles on a complex manifold is an analogue of the boundary of a real manifold , the form s divisor of zeros can be related to the `` infinity '' of a real manifold , if the latter is non - compact ( see section [ qp ] ) .",
    "this parallelism between topology and algebraic geometry extends to various gauge - theoretic notions and facts .",
    "in particular , we discuss below several problems related to the correspondence of flat and holomorphic bundles .",
    "some features of this correspondence are also present in the papers @xcite .",
    "note that the gauge theory related to a version of the chern ",
    "simons functional on calabi  yau manifolds ( see @xcite ) was a motivation for the construction of these homology groups and of the relevant notion of the polar linking number ( see section [ gauge ] and cf .",
    "[ proj ]    we start with a heuristic motivation for polar homology and recall ( following @xcite ) the formal definition of the corresponding groups in the next section .    a holomorphic analogue of orientation . [ inpair ] in order to see why a meromorphic or holomorphic form on a complex manifold can be regarded as an analogue of orientation of a real manifold , we extend the analogy between de rham and dolbeault cochains (  @xmath3  ) to an analogy at the level of the corresponding _ chain  _ complexes .",
    "let @xmath4 be a compact complex manifold and @xmath5 be a smooth @xmath6-form on it , @xmath7 .",
    "we would like to treat such @xmath6-forms in the same manner as ordinary @xmath0-forms on a smooth manifold , but in the framework of complex geometry .",
    "in particular , we have to be able to integrate them over @xmath0-dimensional _ complex _ submanifolds in @xmath4 .",
    "recall that in the theory of differential forms , a form can be integrated over a real submanifold provided that the submanifold is endowed with an orientation .",
    "thus , we need to find a holomorphic analogue of the orientation .    for a @xmath0-dimensional submanifold @xmath8 is equipped with a holomorphic @xmath0-form @xmath9 one can consider the following integral @xmath10 of the product of the @xmath11- and @xmath6-forms .",
    "therefore , here we are going to regard a top degree holomorphic form @xmath9 on a complex manifold as an analogue of orientation .",

    "[ cst ] more generally , if the form @xmath9 is allowed to have first order poles on a smooth hypersurface in @xmath12 , the above integral is still well - defined . the new feature brought by the presence of poles of @xmath9 manifests in the following relation .",

    "then @xmath19 we shall exploit this straightforward generalization of the cauchy formula as a complexified analogue of the stokes theorem .    in the above formula",
    "@xmath20 denotes a @xmath2-form on @xmath21 which is the _ poincar residue _ of @xmath9 .",
    "namely , the form @xmath9 can be locally expressed as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a local equation of @xmath21 in @xmath12 and @xmath24 ( respectively , @xmath25 ) is a holomorphic @xmath26-form ( resp . ,",
    "@xmath27-form ) .",
    "then the restriction @xmath28 is an unambiguously defined holomorphic @xmath26-form on @xmath21 , and it is called the poincar residue @xmath20 of the form @xmath9 .    boundary operator .",
    "the cauchy  stokes formula prompts us to consider the pair @xmath29 consisting of a @xmath0-dimensional submanifold @xmath12 equipped with a meromorphic form @xmath9 ( with first order poles on @xmath21 ) as an analogue of a compact oriented submanifold with boundary . in the polar homology theory",
    "the pairs @xmath29 will play the role of chains , while the boundary operator will take the form @xmath30 . note , that in the situation under consideration , when the polar set @xmath21 of the form @xmath9 is a smooth @xmath2-dimensional submanifold in a smooth @xmath0-dimensional @xmath12 , the induced  orientation \" on @xmath21 is given by a holomorphic @xmath2-form @xmath20 .",

    "one can see that this pairing descends to ( co)homology classes by virtue of the cauchy  stokes formula : @xmath38    [ incurv ] now we are already able to find out the polar homology groups @xmath33 of a complex projective curve @xmath39 . in this ( and in any ) case , all the 0-chains are cycles .",

    "they are polar homologically equivalent iff @xmath44 .",

    "polar intersections . [ x ]",
    "one can define a polar analogue of the intersection number in topology .",
    "for instance , let @xmath52 be a complex manifold equipped with a meromorphic volume form @xmath53 without zeros ( its  polar orientation \" ) .",
    "consider two polar cycles @xmath54 and @xmath55 of complimentary dimensions that intersect transversely in @xmath4 ( here @xmath45 and @xmath56 are volume forms , or ",
    "polar orientations , \" on the corresponding submanifolds ) .",
    "then the polar intersection number is defined by the formula @xmath57 at every intersection point @xmath58 , the ratio in the right - hand - side is the  comparison \" of the orientations of the polar cycles at that point ( the form @xmath59 at @xmath58 ) with the orientation of the ambient manifold ( the form @xmath53 at @xmath58 ) .",
    "this is a straightforward analogue of the use of mutual orientation of cycles in the definition of the topological intersection number .",
    "note , that in the polar case the intersection number does not have to be an integer .",
    "( rather , it is a holomorphic function of the  parameters \" @xmath60 and @xmath61 . )    similarly , there is a polar analogue of the intersection product of cycles when they intersect over a manifold of positive dimension , given essentially by the same formula ( see [ kr2 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , one can define a polar analogue of the linking number using the same philosophy of polar chains .",
    "we discuss polar linkings , which are very close in spirit to the polar intersections , in relation to the chern ",
    "simons theory at the end of the paper .",
    "most of the above discussion extends to polar chains @xmath54 where the meromorphic @xmath62-form @xmath45 is not necessarily of top degree , that is @xmath63 , where @xmath64 . to define the boundary operator we have to restrict ourselves to the meromorphic forms with logarithmic singularities .",
    "the corresponding polar homology groups are enumerated by two indices @xmath0 and @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "one can see that the cauchy  stokes formula extends to this case as well , if we pair meromorphic @xmath62-forms @xmath9 on @xmath12 with smooth @xmath65-forms on @xmath4 .",
