    "this theoretical expectation was spectacularly confirmed by the detection of a handful of neutrinos from sn1987a in the nearby large magellanic cloud  @xcite . while the much larger , more heavily instrumented detectors such as super - kamiokande ( ) and   await the flood of neutrinos from another such nearby , it is interesting to ask if either detector might observe the diffuse , isotropic flux of neutrinos from all  events that have ever occurred within the observable universe .",
    "the detection of this cosmological background of core - collapse supernova relic neutrinos ( srn ) offers a new probe of  neutrino physics and of the high redshift universe .",
    "the basic picture of core - collapse  could be tested , not only locally but also at high redshifts ( @xmath4 ) . from the srn",
    "we will also obtain estimates of the supernova rate ( proportional to the star formation rate for @xmath5 ) and of the metal enrichment rate which are completely independent of those from optical and uv surveys .",
    "note that other tracers of the cosmological star formation history typically only lead to lower bounds on the star formation rate .",
    "comparison with traditional methods would yield information about high redshift star formation complementary to that from future high redshift galaxy surveys like deep2 @xcite ( which targets @xmath6 ) . here",
    "we consider the possibility of srn detection at two existing neutrino detectors ,  and .",
    "we also consider the detection of the srn in a modified  detector with lower threshold and reduced backgrounds ( like the recently proposed sk - gadzooks @xcite ) . as discussed later , detection of the srn at _ both _  and  can be used to probe the cosmic star formation history at @xmath4 , of which little is known from traditional astronomical methods .",
    "the prediction of the srn flux has been the subject of many previous investigations @xcite .",
    "the earlier study of kaplinghat , steigman , and walker 2000 ( ksw ) @xcite reached the pessimistic conclusion that it would be unlikely for  to detect the srn background , a result driven by three factors .",
    "first there was the realization that for  to detect these relic neutrinos , the actual flux must be close to the predicted upper bound and , in addition , the @xmath7 must be nearly maximally mixed with @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",
    "however , as discussed below , recent results on the cosmic star formation history from observational data , including those from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , lead to a predicted srn rate that _ is _ closer to the _ upper _ bound derived in ksw .",
    "furthermore , neutrino experiments , such as sno ,  , and  have clearly identified the large mixing angle case as the preferred solution to the solar neutrino problem @xcite , implying that the  @xmath10 _ are _ ( nearly ) maximally mixed .",
    "the second factor concerned the backgrounds to the detection of the srn .",
    "ksw estimated the primary background at , due to sub - cherenkov muons ( to be discussed later ) , by extrapolating from older kamiokande data .",
    "the estimated background to the detection of the srn in the energy window ( for positrons ) from 19 to 35 mev was 39 events per year .",
    "the latest  analysis @xcite reveals that the background in the same energy window is actually about 19 events per year .",
    "the third factor leading to the negative conclusion of ksw concerned the spectrum of the srn flux .",
    "the difference between the spectra of the srn and the sub - cherenkov muon neutrino fluxes could help to separate the srn signal from this background but , given the large expected background and the uncertainties in the supernova rate , ksw did not attempt to account for this in their analysis .",
    "however , considering the current status of the first two factors , it is clear that a more detailed analysis is now appropriate .",
    "although with 4 years of data  did not see any supernova relic neutrinos , they did reduce the upper limit on the srn flux at 90% c.l . to @xmath11 @xmath12s@xmath13 , for positron energies @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "this limit is more than two orders of magnitude smaller than the previous kamiokande - ii upper limit @xcite and is approaching several of the theoretical estimates of the srn flux . given this very encouraging state of affairs , along with the advances in recent years in our understanding of the cosmic star formation history , we believe it is timely to attempt a realistic , quantitative estimate of the likely range for the srn flux .    for  our analysis is restricted to positron energies @xmath15 mev .",
    "in contrast the kamland detector , as a result of their detection technique , have much smaller backgrounds at energies suitable for detecting srn and are therefore sensitive to much lower energy neutrinos ( positrons with e @xmath16 mev ) .",
    "thus , even though kamland is a much smaller detector than  , it profits with respect to  by being sensitive to more of the srn spectrum and also by its sensitivity to neutrinos from supernovae at higher redshifts compared to .",
    "we also present results for the srn flux expected at kamland in the idealized limit in which kamland is able to utilizes its entire 1 kton volume for detecting srn with 100% efficiency .",
    "we also discuss detection in the hypothetical sk - gadzooks detector , the propeties of which were described in beacom & vagins @xcite .",
    "estimates for a hypothetical detector `` hyperkamiokande '' @xcite , with a fiducial volume of @xmath17 kton(@xmath18 ) , can be obtained by appropriately scaling the flux at  and noting that the errors on the flux scale as @xmath19 .",

    "there are two primary backgrounds .",
    "the first comes from low energy atmospheric @xmath7 produced from the decay chain of @xmath23 and @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "below @xmath25 the srn flux from our median estimate ( see below ) , which peaks at roughly @xmath26 , exceeds the atmospheric @xmath7 flux . the second background comes from atmospheric @xmath27 which interact with a nucleus to form a @xmath24 with kinetic energy @xmath28 .",
    "such @xmath29s are not detected as they are below the threshold for cerenkov radiation , but their decay products are detected , with energy distribution given by the michel spectrum . by performing a multicomponent fit to the observed michel spectrum , as well as that for the atmospheric @xmath30 ,  obtained their impressive limit on the srn background flux @xcite .",
    "it would be ideal if there were a way to detect the recoil neutrons from the @xmath31 interaction ( analgous to the neutral current detection at sno ) as was suggested in a recent proposal @xcite .",
    "this neutron tagging would remove the @xmath27 and spallation backgrounds , allowing  to move to a lower energy threshold of 10 mev .",
    "such a reduction in threshold will tell us more about high redshift supernovae and the corresponding star formation history than any other existing method .",
    "regardless , for the estimates of the srn flux at  presented here we limit ourselves to neutrinos with energies @xmath32  mev ( positrons with e@xmath33  mev ) .",
    "the current predictions from ando , sato , & totani @xcite show that for sk the expected flux is roughly @xmath34 , which is close to the lower limit derived from fukugita & kawasaki @xcite .",
    "below we show how median estimates of the sn rate as a function of redshift can give a flux very close to the current  upper limit",

    "kamland detects @xmath7 via inverse beta decay by a prompt signal from positron annihilation , followed by a @xmath35 time - delayed neutron capture @xmath36-ray of 2.2 mev .",
    "the spectrum of the reactor @xmath7 peaks near 3 mev , and with neutrino oscillations is negligible above 6 mev .",
    "the kamland collaboration analysis imposes a lower cutoff of 2.6 mev to account for the background from terrestrial @xmath7 sources .",
    "unlike , kamland can readily exclude the invisible muon decay background since the prompt signal from positron annihilation is not followed by neutron capture .",
    "the kamland background at energies greater than 6 mev is from atmospheric @xmath7 , which competes with our estimated srn signal at energies @xmath37 .",
    "kamland s smaller background at low energies , in the region where the srn spectrum peaks , may make it possible for kamland to detect the srn background .",
    "preliminary results at   for a 0.28 kton - year exposure show no @xmath7 signal above the small expected backgrounds @xcite .",
    "current theoretical estimates assuming that kamland can use the entire 1 kton volume for srn detection ( ando , sato and totani 2003  @xcite ) suggest that in the energy window 10  25 mev , the srn event rate is @xmath38 . in our analysis here",
    "the srn flux for ( positron ) energies e @xmath39 mev is considered .",
    "this lower energy threshold is chosen since , so far , there are no events seen above this energy at kamland  @xcite . in addition , in our estimates for kamland we adopt an idealization in which kamland utilizes the entire 1 kton fiducial volume with @xmath40 efficiency for srn . based on our best estimate of the supernova rate which saturates the  bound , the expected rate in an idealized kamland detector is 0.4 events per year .",
    "the differential flux of srn @xmath7 , @xmath41 , depends on the magnitude and evolution ( as a function of redshift @xmath42 ) of the  supernova rate @xmath43 , and on the @xmath7 energy spectrum @xmath44 ,    @xmath45    the energy of the detected positron , @xmath46 , is related to that of the @xmath7 by @xmath47 . in the above equation the average is over the stellar initial mass function ( imf @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the number of stars of mass @xmath50 ) . in practice ,",

    ", we use the @xmath56cdm cosmology ( i.e. , a flat , cosmological constant dominated model with matter density @xmath57 and hubble constant @xmath58 ) .",
    "the core - collapse sn rate at a given redshift is just the star formation rate ( sfr ) at that redshift for stellar masses larger than @xmath59 . to obtain the sn rate we link the sfr to an observable proxy such as the uv or h@xmath60 luminosity density .",
    "the interpretation of the measured high redshift uv luminosity density is complicated by the fact that uv light is strongly absorbed by dust , while measurements of h@xmath60 , though less affected by dust , are not as simple to relate to the star formation rate .",
    "in addition to correcting for dust extinction , converting the uv light to a sfr requires correcting for the incomplete sampling of the luminosity function , as well as cosmological surface brightness dimming , the latter being true at all frequencies for any extended object @xcite    > from the determination of the sfr we extract the sn rate , @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the star formation rate in average mass per time per comoving volume .",
    "we have limited the upper bound to 30 @xmath63 due to the potential uncertainties in the neutrino flux from sne with progenitors more massive than that .",
    "here @xmath64 is the global stellar imf , assumed constant over redshift , which is a good approximation provided there are no significant correlations between the imf and the environment in which the stars are born .",
    "extant evidence seem to argue against such correlations over the redshift range of interest ( @xmath65)@xcite . averaging over a salpeter imf for @xmath66 , the sn rate is @xmath67 , assuming the star formation rate is measured in solar masses .",
    "the conversion factor is not sensitive to the upper limit of the average as long as the upper limit is larger than about 25 @xmath63 .",
    "the sensitivity to changes in the imf slope is more pronounced ; if we use baldry and glazebrook @xcite ( bg03 ; see below ) best - fit imf ( @xmath68 ) , the conversion factor increases by 30% .    following @xcite , we parametrize the sfr as @xmath69 for @xmath70 , and @xmath71 for @xmath72 and use various observational proxies to estimate @xmath60 , @xmath73 , and the normalization . from our assumption above of a redshift - independent imf ,",
    "we can then parametrize the sn rate as @xmath74 in equation [ rsn ] we have assumed that the @xmath75 behavior continues to higher redshift .",
    "hogg @xcite has compiled measurements of the uv and h@xmath60 luminosity density , as well as results from measurement of the near uv emission , far - infrared and radio continuum to obtain the @xmath76 c.l .",
    "limits of @xmath77 .",
    "results from the cosmic optical spectrum measurements from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) find limits on @xmath73 from @xmath78 and @xmath60 from @xmath79 @xcite ( g03 ) . using the sdds data and marginalizing over the imf and evolution of the sfr , bg03 determine the local density of sfr to be in the range @xmath80 .",
    "the lower portion of this range for the slopes and normalzation is only valid , however , if the slope of the global imf is allowed to vary near the bg03 best fit .",
    "this lower portion is also consistent with the results of madau et al .",
    "based on the observed uv luminosity density of the whole galaxy population @xcite . however , the madau et al .",
    "results do not take into account the correction for surface brightness dimming and provide a smaller average correction for dust extinction @xcite , and thus permit the possibility that the sn rate may _ decline _ for @xmath81 .",
    "in addition , studies of extra - galactic background light have recently shown that current surface brightness corrections suggest that @xmath82 of the high redshift galaxy population is yet unobserved @xcite .",
    "the choice of how to handle the dust extinction thus dominates the uncertainty budget for the high redshift sn rate .",
    "although the slope of the sfr for @xmath81 is poorly constrained from the sdss results , examination of high redshift uv data @xcite shows that the sfr remains constant or even increases beyond @xmath83 .",
    "an increase in @xmath60 would not significantly change the _",
    "observable _ srn flux at super - k , as the energy window @xmath84 is not very sensitive to the @xmath85 sn rate .",

    "however , an increase in @xmath60 would increase the observable flux at kamland ( or any other relatively low threshold detector such as the proposed sk - gadzooks ) , due to its sensitivity to lower energy neutrinos .",
    "below we discuss the extent to which a comparison of signals between kamland and super - k can constrain the high redshift sfr .",

    "this normalization is perfectly consistent with the observations and is specifically chosen to saturate the  result , for the adopted slopes @xmath73 and @xmath60 .",
    "this `` median '' sn rate ( and its associated srn background ) is shown by the solid curves in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "note that for this value of @xmath92 , and with an average density of galaxies of @xmath93 , the present average supernova rate is expected to be @xmath94 per 65 years per galaxy . though the uv and sdss analyses do permit models with higher star formation rates , such models are ruled out by the  upper limits to the srn flux .",
    "in particular , _ any models _ with values of @xmath73 and/or @xmath92 which exceed our median estimates will violate the  upper bound on the srn flux .",
    "as a specific example , if the slopes were fixed at @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and a salpeter imf adopted , this would require a sfr @xmath97 in order to satisfy the  flux limit .",
    "thus , it is clear that the  upper bound on the srn flux already provides valuable constraints on the cosmic star formation history .",
    "it is interesting , but less certain , to estimate a reasonable lower limit to the srn flux based on the above observational proxies .",
    "we choose a `` lower limit '' model , shown by the dotted curves in figures 1 and 2 , with @xmath98 , @xmath90 , @xmath99 .",
    "finally , in order to determine the impact on the srn flux of increasing the high redshift sfr , we consider a variation to our `` median / best estimate '' model with @xmath89 and @xmath100 , by setting @xmath96 ( dashed curves in figures 1 and 2 ) .",
    "we note that the predictions of ando , sato , & totani , and of kawasaki & fukugita @xcite use sn rates which are closer to this sdss inspired lower bound .",
    "as already mentioned , with its sensitivity to lower energy neutrinos kamland has the potential to probe the high redshift star formation history .",
    "about 40% of the @xmath10 flux in the kamland energy window comes from @xmath101 ; about 10% of the flux is from sn at @xmath102 .",
    "thus it is clear that a comparison of the fluxes at  and kamland has the potential to provide valuable information about the star formation history for @xmath103 .",
    "if the sfr at @xmath104 is much larger than the estimates adopted here ( there are some hints in this direction @xcite ) , then it might be possible to probe the star formation rate at @xmath104 .",
    "below , we quantify the information that can be gleaned about high redshift star formation using  and kamland .",
    "the other key ingredient in calculating the background flux of srn is the _ spectrum _ of supernova neutrinos .",
    "the supernova neutrino spectrum is typically modelled by a fermi - dirac spectrum with an effective chemical potential , @xmath105 , @xmath106 equation [ eq : fermi ] may be used to relate the average @xmath7 energy @xmath107 to the @xmath7 neutrinosphere temperature .",

    "we adopt a fermi - dirac distribution with zero chemical potential , characterized by @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "we assume that the total energy carried by each flavor of neutrino is @xmath113 .",
    "the average is taken over the imf of the  progenitors .",
    "this does not introduce additional significant uncertainties since neither the temperature of the neutrinosphere nor the binding energy of the neutron star depend very sensitively on the the mass of the progenitor and , hence , on the averaging over the imf .",

    "@xcite including muon and tau transport models suggest that the imf - averaged energies may not be hierarchical , but that @xmath114 . for a spectrum normalized to the same total energy output in all neutrino species ,",

    "these mass eigenstates travel separately to the surface of the earth and , in the absence of earth matter effects , the final @xmath7 flux will have a fraction @xmath128 of the original @xmath129 flux .",
