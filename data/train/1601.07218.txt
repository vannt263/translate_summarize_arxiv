    "effective field theories ( eft ) play a central role in modern physics .",
    "they cover almost all branches in physics such as nuclear systems derived from low - energy quantum chromodynamics @xcite , chiral perturbation theory @xcite , bcs theory formulated from conventional superconductivity @xcite , inflationary model in cosmology @xcite , gravitationally induced decoherence @xcite , and so on .",
    "even our most fundamental theories , general relativity and the standard model , are thought of as leading terms of some underlying theory @xcite .",
    "the ideas concerning eft have began with a nonlinear modification of maxwell electromagnetism made in order to understand the photon ",
    "photon electrodynamical scattering process by euler and heisenberg @xcite in the 1930s . at the same time",
    ", fermi developed the theory of beta decay to describe the elementary process @xmath1 in the framework of quantum field theory @xcite . even having some interesting features , fermi and euler  heisenberg theories",
    "were not taken seriously since they were not renormalizable . nevertheless , some years later , the development of the renormalization and the renormalization group techniques @xcite , along with the theorem derived by appelquist and carazzone @xcite  which states that heavy mass particles can be decoupled from low energy dynamics under certain conditions  gave rise to the current eft programme @xcite .",
    "effective theories allow us to simplify the description of a given physical process by taking into account the appropriate variables at a given energy scale , i.e. , one can consider only the relevant degrees of freedom at a specific energy range .",
    "it is basically a low energy dynamics valid below some energy scale and which does not depend on the behavior in the ultraviolet regime .",
    "eft have the advantage of reducing the number of degrees of freedom , turning the description of the physical system under consideration easier to deal with .",
    "an appropriate choice of degrees of freedom is a crucial point in the understanding of the problem .",
    "one interesting set of eft models are the so - called higher - order theories .",
    "this class of theories are characterized basically by the modification of the free propagator through the introduction of higher - order kinetic terms in the lagrangian , which leads to a modified propagator that exhibits a better asymptotic behavior .",
    "however , these theories are usually plagued with ghosts states , giving rise to non - hermitian interactions and scattering processes that do not preserve probabilities , violating the unitarity .",
    "there are many phenomena that are described in this framework such as dark energy @xcite , ultraviolet regulators @xcite , renormalizable gravity models @xcite , string theory @xcite , and supersymmetry @xcite , for instance .",
    "it also have been suggested that quantum gravity effects can give rise to partners to every field in the standard model @xcite , which can be included in a straightforward way by the aforementioned formalism , generating an extension of the sm .",
    "in addition , some work has recently demonstrated that higher - order derivative theories may emerge in the scope of noncommutative spacetimes @xcite . in this framework , the introduction of a minimal length naturally generates higher - order kinetic terms , as in the case of electrodynamics and general relativity @xcite , for instance . in this sense ,",
    "a better understanding of some basic features of higher - order theories would certainly help us to improve our knowledge of this set of models .",
    "concerning qed , a possible way to find an effective lagrangian is through the addition of a gauge - invariant dimension-6 operator containing higher derivatives in the free lagrangian of the @xmath0 sector , namely , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the only parameter added to theory and is responsible for introducing a cutoff in the ultraviolet regime of qed .",
    "this modification is very similar to pauli ",
    "villars regularization procedure @xcite , lee  wick model @xcite at quantum level , and podolsky electromagnetism @xcite in the classical context .",
    "the new degree of freedom in qed changes dramatically the behavior of the theory at short distances .",
    "nevertheless , unitarity is not preserved .",
    "many remarkable features are found in this qed extension such as the coexistence of dirac magnetic monopoles and massive vector bosons @xcite , the presence of finite electromagnetic mass and self - energy of point particles @xcite .",
    "also , it provides an adequate scenario to solve the 4/3 problem @xcite    our goal in this paper is precisely to address : ( i ) the one - loop radiative corrections , ( ii ) the perturbative renormalization of the hdqed in the complex - mass shell ( cms ) scheme , ( iii ) a quantum bound on the @xmath3-parameter using the measurement of the electron anomalous magnetic moment , ( iv ) the decay width of the unstable mode taking into account the electron ",
    "positron scattering , ( iv ) the computation of the uehling potential in the hdqed framework , and the ( v ) analysis of the renormalization group .",

    "2 we give a brief description of our model .",
    "in the following section , sect .",
    "3 , we compute the second - order radiative corrections in the hdqed context . also , the finite decay width of the unstable mode is explicity calculated . at the end of sect .",

    "it is clear that the system will carry more degrees of freedom than maxwell electromagnetism . in this sense , it is instructive understand what is the particle content of this model at the quantum level . to accomplish this , we first add the gauge - fixing term @xmath12 to the lagrangian ( [ hdqedlagrangian ] ) , where @xmath13 is the gauge - fixing parameter , and then compute the propagator in momentum space , which assumes the form @xmath14.\\ ] ] contracting ( [ lwp ] ) with the external conserved currents @xmath15 , one obtains @xmath16 the scattering amplitude ( [ amp ] ) has poles at @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "taking into account that @xmath19 is space - like ( @xmath20 ) @xcite , we have the residues @xmath21    from the above residues it is clear that the model under consideration carry two spin-1 modes , one massless and one massive .",
    "the positive sign residue corresponds to the spin-1 massless excitation , which can be related to the qed photon .",
    "the spin-1 massive mode possess a wrong sign residue which give rise to negative norm states ( ghost states ) and consequently causes unitarity violation .",
    "however , since we are treating the hdqed as an effective field theory , it will not concern us .",
    "regarding to renormalizability , the modified spin-1 propagator always occurs coupled to conserved current , which means that terms proportional to the momenta @xmath22 give vanish contributions .",
    "hence , the modified propagator reduces to @xmath23 which is the difference between maxwell and proca propagators . the first term on the right of eq .",
    "( [ lwpesc ] ) is the qed propagator , which is renormalizable by power counting .",
    "the second corresponds to a massive spin-1 propagator .",
    "massive vector theories have a bad behavior at high energies and do not go to zero asymptotically . however , there are two exceptions : ( i ) gauge theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking and ( ii ) neutral vector bosons coupled to conserved currents .",
    "the condition ( ii ) ensures the renormalizability of the proca model , showing that the model is renormalizable by power counting .    according to eq .",
    "( [ lwpesc ] ) , the nonrelativistic potential @xmath24 between two electrically charged particle can be expressed as @xmath25 which have the following properties :    1 .",
    "the regularized potential is finite at the origin @xmath26 which is evidence that point - like particles has electromagnetic mass and self - energy finities .",
    "the standard coulomb potential is recovered when @xmath27 .",

    "the dashed line represents the coulomb potential ( in units of @xmath32 ) .",
    "it is clear from the above figure that in the hdqed the potential is finite at origin . here",
    ", we are assuming the @xmath3-value found ( @xmath33 gev ) in sect .",
    "the lagrangian density characterizing the higher - derivative spinor quantum electrodynamics can be written as @xmath34 where the first term on the right is the dirac kinetic operator , @xmath35 is the electron mass and the last term denotes the interacting term . in the lowest - order perturbation theory , the scattering of charged particles by each other is characterized by the matrix element of the operator in momentum space @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the conserved charged fermionic current and @xmath38 is the feynman propagator .    according to ( [ cc ] )",
    ", the modified propagator always occurs coupled to conserved currents and the momenta dependence vanishes , reducing the propagator to @xmath39 which provides a better behavior at high energies since the propagator goes as @xmath40 at the asymptotic limit . by power counting , all higher - order process of the lagrangian ( [ lwl ] ) are finite , except for the charge renormalization . in other words ,",
    "the qed primary divergences related to the electron self - energy and vertex corrections are convergent .",
    "nevertheless , the vacuum polarization diagram , as in qed case , is ultraviolet divergent .",
    "we will apply the dimensional regularization to cancel off the divergence arising from the vacuum polarization .",
    "now , we shall undertake the computation of second - order radiative corrections of the hdqed .",

    "indeed , this result is not a surprise since the self - force acting on a point charge particle is finite and well defined in the hdqed scenario . as an aside",
    ", we remark that the 4/3 problem finds a natural explanation in the hdqed context since the electromagnetic mass enters in the aharonov ",
    "lorentz equation in a form consistent with special relativity @xcite . nevertheless , the infrared divergence remains .      in the hdqed ,",
    "the second - order vertex correction is given by @xmath49 as in the case of electron self - energy , the vertex correction ( [ vc ] ) is ultraviolet convergent at short distances due to the modified propagator .",
    "again , no regularization procedure is necessary . in order to obtain an explicit form of the vertex correction",
    ", we can use the gordon identity of the dirac current , which yields @xmath50 where the functions @xmath51 and @xmath52 are called the form factors and @xmath53 is the four - momentum transfer at the vertex . at radiative corrections , the information concerning to vertex corrections are all contained in @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",

    "also , the appearance of a complex massive pole implies that one can not just apply the standard renormalization schemes .",
    "the appropriate framework to treat this issue needs to take into account the existence of unstable particles , a point that deserves some considerations and that will be done in sect .",
    "6 .      before proceeding with the renormalization procedure we will discuss the finite decay rate of the unstable mode . to begin with",
    ", we first introduce the auxiliary field formalism .",
    "this technique has the advantage of eliminate the higher - order kinetic terms through the introduction of auxiliary fields , reducing the lagrangian to quadratic terms in the fields .",
    "so , defining the auxiliary field @xmath89 inserting in the lagrangian ( [ hdqedlagrangian ] ) , and defining @xmath90 , the lagrangian ( [ hdqedlagrangian ] ) assumes the form @xmath91,\\ ] ] where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are related to the massless and massive fields , respectively .",
    "here we promptly note that the introduction of auxiliary fields provide us a clear interpretation of the distinct modes at different energy levels .",
    "according to ( [ lagrangianreduced ] ) , at low energy , the massless mode dominates over the massive one the description of the system , reproducing the results of qed .",
    "however , at high frequencies , the massive mode emerges and gives contributions to the physical observables as the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron , for instance .",
    "thereafter , at short distances the unstable mode should develop a finite decay width . in the auxiliary field formalism",
    "the decay width description can be simplified by noting that at the ultraviolet regime only the massive propagator is relevant , namely , @xmath94 which is the proca propagator with a minus sign . in electron ",
    "positron scattering , when the mass of the massive mode exceeds the electron ",
    "positron mass ( @xmath95 ) , the negative residue appears in the physical sheet .",
    "however , as we have discussed in the previous section , at this energy range the massive mode becomes complex and must decay in light particles .",
    "the decay width @xmath96 can be obtained by the standard self - energy sum .",
    "hence , at the narrow width approximation , the resummed massive propagator assumes the form @xmath97    comparing the denominator of ( [ narrowpropagator ] ) with the imaginary part that arises in the self - energy sum when @xmath98 in ( [ functionfk ] ) , we promptly find that the finite decay width of the @xmath3-parameter is @xmath99    to check the consistency of the previous decay width derivation , one can follow another route to obtain the decay rate of the @xmath3-parameter through the analysis of the electron  positron elastic scattering .",
    "the general expression for the decay rate of this process is @xmath100 where @xmath57 is the massive spin-1 four - momentum and @xmath101 and @xmath102 are related to the electron and positron momenta , respectively .",
    "the electron ",
    "positron elastic scattering amplitude is @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the polarization vector and @xmath105 and @xmath106 represent the fermions functions . using the completeness relation ,",

    "it is worth to note that since @xmath110 , the @xmath96 factor reduces to @xmath111    in general , there may be many decays modes , which means that the massive mode lifetime @xmath112 is given by @xmath113 where using our estimative for the mass value @xmath33 gev gives a lifetime of @xmath114 .",
    "one of the great triumphs of qed was the prediction of the small difference between the energy levels @xmath115 and @xmath116 in the hydrogen atom  the lamb shift  which is related to the radiative corrections to the coulomb potential coming from the vacuum polarization .",

    "to conclude we remark that in the limit that @xmath3 goes to infinity , the @xmath120-integral becomes a gamma function and the potential ( [ uintdksimpzeta ] ) reduces to @xmath131 which is the standard uehling potential in qed .",
    "the presence of a finite decay width implies that one needs to find an appropriate framework to describe unstable particles in the perturbation theory .",
    "it follows that applying directly the standard summation of self - energy violates the gauge invariance @xcite . to circumvent this problem ,",
    "many methods have been proposed over the last years @xcite . currently , the most general procedure to treat perturbative renormalization of unstable particles in quantum field theory is the so - called complex - mass shell ( cms ) scheme .",

    "we also call attention to the fact that our computations were made in the lorenz gauge . however , any gauge condition is feasible @xcite .    from the analysis of the complex - mass shell conditions in the perturbative renormalization scheme ,",
    "we have concluded that the hdqed enforces us to input another constraint in order to fix all the counterterms in the renormalized lagrangian . concerning the charge renormalization ,",

    "this measurement has been used to estimate stringent constraints on possible theories beyond the standard model . using the latest measurements of the mentioned phenomenon we found @xmath165 gev .",
    "also , we have calculated the uehling potential in the hdqed framework .",
    "although the effect of uehling potential to the lamb shift is negligible , in muonic atoms the vacuum polarization is dominant , which in principle could be used to put a new bound in the mass parameter of hdqed .",
    "this new constraint on the @xmath3-parameter can be further investigated in the future .",
    "regarding the modern particle physics experiments , we point out that the detection of this new degree of freedom could be related to physics beyond the standard model . in our prescription",
    "we have included the higher - order term after the spontaneous symmetry breaking has occurred in the electroweak theory ( ew ) .",
    "however , this new degree of freedom could be added in the ew lagrangian before the symmetry breakdown . in this way",
    ", the appearance of a mass@xmath166 dimensional parameter at tev scale could be a sign of a phenomenon arising from new physics , as effects of a large extra dimension , for instance .    in order to outline possible directions for future investigations",
    ", we would like to emphasize that the scenario developed here to treat unstable modes could be extended , at least in principle , to other spin fields .",
    "also , issues concerning the unitarity of higher - order theories in the cms formalism can be investigated in the future .",

    "<S> the modification in the spin-1 sector leads the electron self - energy and vertex corrections diagrams finite in the ultraviolet regime . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , no regularization prescription is used to calculate these diagrams because the modified propagator always occurs coupled to conserved currents . moreover , besides the usual massless pole in the spin-1 sector , there is the emergence of a massive one , which becomes complex when computing the radiative corrections at one - loop order . </S>",
    "<S> this imaginary part defines the finite decay width of the massive mode . to check consistency </S>",
    "<S> , we also derive the decay length using the electron  positron elastic scattering and show that both results are equivalent . because the presence of this unstable mode , the standard renormalization procedures can not be used and is necessary adopt an appropriate framework to perform the perturbative renormalization . for this purpose , we apply the complex - mass shell scheme ( cms ) to renormalize the aforementioned model . as an application of the formalism developed </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate a quantum bound on the massive parameter using the measurement of the electron anomalous magnetic moment and compute the uehling potential . at the end , the renormalization group is analyzed . </S>"
