    "in a closed circular double stranded dna molecule , the two strands are linked .",
    "the number of times the two strands wind around each other is a topological invariant , and it is called the linking number @xmath0 , an integer that may be positive or negative depending on the orientation of the two strands . due to the right - handed double helical structure of dna , there is an intrinsic linking number @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the number of base pairs ( bp ) of the dna , and @xmath3 is the number of base pairs per helical turn of dna .",
    "it is more convenient to describe the topological states of the circular dna using the linking number difference @xmath4 .",
    "since @xmath5 is not an integer , @xmath6 is not an integer either .",
    "however , @xmath6 can only defer by integer numbers .",
    "previous experiments and simulations show that , the equilibrium distributions of @xmath6 for circular dna in the range of 250 - 10,000 bp may be approximated by gaussian distributions .",
    "a thorough review of linking number distributions of circular dna can be found in @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the linking number puts a constraint on the twist and the writhe of a dna @xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the difference between the actual twist of the circular dna and the relaxed twist of the same dna of linear form ; @xmath9 is the writhe of the dna backbone . due to this constraint",
    ", the distribution of @xmath6 may be obtained from convolution of the distributions of @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite : @xmath10 please note that an assumption is made where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are independent , which is a reasonable approximation according to @xcite .    for a linear dna of a contour length @xmath13 ,",
    "its twist energy in @xmath14 unit can be approximated by an harmonic form : @xmath15 , where @xmath16 nm is the canonical twist persistence length of a b - dna @xcite .",
    "the harmonic form of the twist energy leads to a gaussian distribution of the twist with a variance of @xmath17 .",
    "on the other hand , the writhe distribution depends on the bending elasticity model of dna . in a discretized dna model",
    ", a dna can be considered to be a chain consisting of @xmath2 straight segments of a segment length @xmath18 , where @xmath19 nm is the persistence length of linear b - form dna .",
    "the bending energy is carried by the @xmath2 vertices in a circular dna : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the bending energy of the @xmath22 vertex connecting the two adjacent tangent vectors @xmath23 and @xmath24 .    in the worm - like chain ( wlc ) model of dna , @xmath25 , where the persistence length @xmath26 is also the correlation length of local tangent vectors @xcite .",
    "previously , eq . ( [ eq.lk ] ) was used to obtain the linking number distributions based on the wlc model @xcite .",
    "the predicted @xmath27 were found in good agreement with those measured in experiments @xcite for circular dnas of 250 - 10,000 bp sized in a wide temperature range of 4 - 37 degree celsius @xcite .",
    "in addition , the wlc model has been supported by numerous other experiments including the force - extension measurements of single dnas of micrometer(s ) long @xcite , and the `` j - factor '' measurement to measure the looping probability of dna of larger than 230 bp @xcite .",
    "it has no doubt that for dna larger than @xmath28 bp , at temperature below 37 degree celsius , the wlc model with choice of @xmath26 in 45 - 53 nm is suitable to describe the dna bending elasticity",
    ".    however , the above experiments and simulations do not rule out the possibility that wlc may fail to describe dna elasticity at sharper bending conditions ( for example , small dna loops ) , or / and at higher temperatures .",
    "the most likely defects are melted base pairs or base pairs that lose their stacking interactions with its neighboring base pairs .",
    "the possibility of excitation of such defect was first pointed out by crick and klug @xcite , and recently was observed in molecular dynamics simulation @xcite , where the defect is an unstacked base - pair step that allows formation of @xmath29 degrees of bending at the defect site .",
    "furthermore , such defects were also observed in @xmath30 bp minicircles recently @xcite .",
    "we note that both melting and unstacking are sensitive to temperature .",
    "theoretically , it has been shown that rare excitations of flexible defects may have drastic effects on the looping efficiency of small dna @xcite . such sensitivity to excitations of flexible defects",
    "is expected to exist in various other aspects of micromechanics of sharply bent dnas . in this research ,",
    "the effects of the flexible defect excitation on @xmath27 of small circular dnas are investigated based on an assumption that the defects have a reduced bending rigidity .",
    "the additional effects of possible reduced twist rigidity and unwinding of defect are also considered .",
    "a defect may change various local mechanical properties , such as bending rigidity , twist rigidity , and may lead to unwinding of dna . in this section , we show that the reduced bending rigidity alone is sufficient to cause measurable increase of variance of the linking number distribution for small circular dnas .",
    "a dna bending energy model that includes the excitations of flexible defects should contain three critical parameters : the persistence length of b - dna @xmath26 , the persistence length of the defect @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) , and the energy required to excite one such defect @xmath33 ( in @xmath14 unit ) . as shown in @xcite , the vertex energy can be straightforwardly written as : @xmath34 where the @xmath35 are two - state variables , indicating whether segment @xmath36 is either in double helix form ( @xmath37 ) or contains a defect ( @xmath38 ) ; @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the vertex bending rigidity of the regular dna site and the defected dna site , respectively . in our simulation ,",

    "this does not mean the defect size has to be 3 bp large .",
    "instead , it means the defect may have a size from 1 bp up to 3 bp , so it includes the defect at single base pair step level as suggested in @xcite . as such , @xmath31 in our model is an average rigidity over all possible defects , and @xmath33 is the average excitation energy .    in the above model , the ising degree of freedom",

    "( [ energy ] ) , mc simulation is used to sample conformations of circular dna . to update the conformation ,",
    "a subchain is rotated by a random angle around the straight line connecting two randomly chosen vertices .",
    "metropolis criterion is applied to determine whether the new conformation is accepted . during the simulation",
    ", the distribution of writhe number is obtained . for each simulated dna circle ,",
    "its writhe is computed by @xcite : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the unit vector pointing from the @xmath52 vertex to the @xmath22 vertex , and @xmath53 is the distance between the two vertices .",
    "normalized histogram of the simulated writhe numbers being divided by the bin size gives the density distribution function @xmath54 .",
    "the volume exclusion is included in the simulation in which conformations with @xmath55 nm are not accepted .",
    "[ fig_num ] shows the average number of defects for circular dna from 40 nm to 160 nm . for @xmath56 @xmath14 ,",
    "there are @xmath57 defects in circular dna bigger than 80 nm , while there are about 2 defects in small circular dna of 40 nm .",
    "this is consistent with the result obtained previously by transfer matrix calculation @xcite .",
    "when @xmath33 decreases to 6 or even 4 @xmath14 , the average number of defects begins to increase with increasing dna length . at 4 @xmath14 ,",
    "about 1/3 of the dna is melted .    in this section",
    ", we only consider the effects of the reduced bending rigidity of the defects , so we set the twist rigidity of the defect to be unchanged : @xmath58 nm",
    ". therefore , the defect excitation does not affect the twist distribution : @xmath11 is a gaussian with a variance : @xmath59 .",

    "( [ energy ] ) was obtained by the normalized histogram of the recorded writhe numbers using a bin size of @xmath64 . the normalized frequency",
    "is then divided by the bin size to obtain the density distribution function @xmath54 .",
    "[ fig_writhe](a - d ) shows @xmath54 for dnas of four different sizes that are subjected to various excitation energies .",
    "clearly , the excitations in general lead to larger fluctuations of @xmath9 .",
    "once @xmath54 is obtained by simulation , @xmath27 is obtained by numerical convolutions of @xmath54 and @xmath11 .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig_lk ] ( a - d ) .",
    "obviously , the widths of the distributions are noticeably increased by the excitations of defects .",
    "the variances of the distributions of @xmath27 are summarized in table [ tab_lk1 ] ( the left number in each bracket ) . from the table ,",
    "the variances can change by a few folds in the range of the excitation energy studied .",
    "table i shows that for dnas @xmath65 nm and at the excitation energy @xmath66 @xmath14 , the variances are very close to the predictions by the traditional wlc model .",
    "this is in agreement with the previous dna cyclization experiments done at temperatures 20 - 30 degrees celsius @xcite , and with the dna linking number distribution measurements for dnas larger than @xmath28 bp done at temperatures 4 - 37 degrees celsius @xcite . for dna of 40 nm ,",
    "the variance at @xmath67 @xmath14 is twice of that predicted by wlc model .",
    "however , the variance is perhaps too small to be measured in experiment . as shown in @xcite , a linking number variance as small as 0.03 can be experimentally measured . as such",
    ", the effects of the defect excitation can be investigated for 80 - 160 nm dnas at @xmath68 @xmath14 .",
    "as shown in table i , under this condition the variances of the linking numbers are apparently larger than that predicted by the wlc model .",
    "in the previous section , we show that with excitation of flexible defects , the flexibility of the defects increases the variance of the writhe distribution , and hence the variance of the linking number distribution .",
    "the mean of the linking number distribution is still zero , therefore , the major information of the effects of the defect is only reflected by the changes in the variance of linking number distribution .",
    "the variance of @xmath6 may be further increased if the defect is accompanied by reduced twist rigidity .",
    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath11 is still a gaussian with a variance : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the number of defects in the dna , and @xmath71 is the twist persistence length of the defect . in this section",
    ", we consider a reduction of the twist persistence length of @xmath72 .",
    "in addition to changes in the bending rigidity and twist rigidity , the defect may also lead to unwinding of dna .",
    "obviously , the underwinding may affect both the mean and variance of the linking number distribution . in b - form dna ,",
    "the relaxed twist angle per base pair step is about @xmath73 .",
    "a defected segment of @xmath44 nm ( @xmath74 bp ) is likely to destroy the local geometry constraint of the twist , leading to unwinding by an angle @xmath75 , hence a relaxed twist angle per segment is about @xmath76 .",
    "the previous sections considered a limiting case where @xmath77 . in this section ,",
    "we consider the effects of @xmath78 up to @xmath79 .    under these conditions , @xmath80 and @xmath81 are obviously no longer independent from each other since they both depend on the excitation of defect .",
    "therefore , the linking number distribution is given by equation @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the probability of the dna to contain @xmath70 defects , and @xmath84 , where @xmath85 refers to @xmath6 or @xmath9 or @xmath86 , is the corresponding conditional distribution .",
    "numerically the linking number distribution can be conveniently calculated directly from mc simulation by equation @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the total number of conformations sampled in the mc simulation . at each step of the simulation ,",
    "the writhe number of the conformation is computed and substituted in the argument of @xmath80 .",
    "the expression of @xmath89 is a gaussian function with a variance determined by eq .",
    "( [ variancetw2 ] ) and average value @xmath90 , where @xmath35 is the number of defects excited in the @xmath22 conformation .",
    "we first look at the combined effects of ( @xmath91 nm , @xmath92 nm , and @xmath93 ) ( table [ tab_lk1 ] , right number in each bracket ) .",
    "it shows that the reduction in twist rigidity of @xmath94 does not significantly increase the linking number variance : for @xmath95 @xmath14 , the variances are nearly the same as those of @xmath96 ; for @xmath97 @xmath14 , the variances are only slightly larger than those of @xmath96 .",
    "this is not surprising : it simply means that , in the presence of a flexible defect , the major contribution to the changes in the linking number distribution is from the changes in writhe distribution .",
    "in contrast to the mild effect of @xmath71 , we expect a dramatic effect of @xmath78 .",
    "firstly , it may change the mean of the linking number since unwinding leads to an offset of the relaxed twist angle per segment ; secondly , it may further increase the linking number distribution since the averages of linking number are dependent on number of defects in the dna , and the number of defects is not a constant .",
    "[ fig_lk_unwind ] shows the linking number distribution of @xmath61 and @xmath63 nm circular dnas with excitation energy @xmath98 and @xmath99 @xmath14 .",
    "as expected , with increasing of unwinding angle , linking number drifts away from the original equilibrium value of zero , and the distribution becomes wider . at the lower excitation energy",
    "@xmath98 @xmath14 , the average linking number drifts to much lower values due to the larger number of excited defects .",
    "to relate the excitation energy @xmath33 to temperature , the candidates of the possible defects should be discussed .",
    "relevant to the dna base pair stability , we consider two candidates : 1 ) the unstacking between two adjacent dna base pairs , and 2 ) the melting of one or a few dna base pairs . it was found recently that the temperature sensitive stacking interaction is the main stabilizing factor in dna double helix , while the @xmath100 pairing is always unstable and the @xmath101 pairing does not contribute to the stability .",
    "in addition , the base pairing was found independent of temperature @xcite .",
    "however , this does not mean that melting does not cost more energy than unstacking .",
    "instead , there is an additional large energy penalty for melting one base pair inside an dna double helix .",
    "this energy penalty is related to a temperature and sequence insensitive `` ring factor '' @xmath102 , corresponding to an energy penalty @xmath103 @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the real melting energy is roughly the unstacking energy plus this large energy penalty .    on the other hand ,",
    "the excitation energy @xmath33 in our model is defined for a given dna conformation , while in a bulk measurement all the possible conformations contribute .",
    "therefore , to relate it to the unstacking or melting energy @xmath104 measured in the bulk experiments , one needs to consider the conformational entropy gain resulted from the defect excitation . according to the excitation model eq .",
    "( [ wlc_bubble ] ) , for an unconstraint dna , the probability of a segment to be defected is @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the zero@xmath107 order modified spherical bessel function of the first kind @xcite . on the other hand , for a two states lattice model it should be @xmath108 .",
    "direct comparison gives @xmath109 ( please not this relation can be derived by comparison between the chain hamiltonian of the defect excitation model and that of the two state lattice model @xcite ) .",
    "using our parameters @xmath110 , and @xmath111 , @xmath112 @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the energies @xmath113 correspond to the bulk values @xmath114 .    as shown in @xcite , the energy contributions from stacking to dna base pair stability are 1.6 - 3.3 @xmath14 for @xmath101 base pair and 1.1 - 2.7 @xmath14 for @xmath100 base pair , respectively , in the temperature range 20 - 55 degrees celsius .",
    "hence , the melting energy of one base pair in the temperature range is 8.2 - 9.9 @xmath14 for @xmath101 base pair and 4.4 - 9.3 @xmath14 for @xmath100 base pair , respectively .",
    "obviously , the melting energies measured in bulk experiments are larger than our excitation energies .",
    "therefore , one should not expect to see much melting related changes in linking number distribution .",
    "however , according to the data , our excitation energies are sufficient to unstack neighboring base pairs .",
    "although it is unclear whether the unstacking defect is a flexible defect , it is reasonable to think that it may lead to the formation of a `` kink '' . since a flexible defect in a small circular dna is presented as a `` kink '' , the prediction based on flexible defect excitation should also describe the effects of kink excitation on the linking number distributions .",
    "in addition , unstacking a base pair step is likely associated with local unwinding , so the discussion of the effect of unwinding may also be relevant .    as shown in our computation",
    ", the excitation of defects can change the linking number distribution through three ways : 1 ) increase the variance of the writhe distribution by reduced local bending rigidity ( equivalently , formation of local kink ) , therefore increase the linking number variance ; 2 ) increase the variance of the twist distribution by reduced local twist rigidity , therefore increase the linking number variance , and 3 ) reduce the average and increase the variance of the twist by local unwinding , therefore drift and widen the distribution of linking number . at low excitation energies ( i.e. , high temperatures ) , 1 ) and 3 ) dominate .",
    "in addition to study dna base pair stability , these predictions may be useful in other applications .",
    "for example , one can use it to study non - specific interactions between dna and dna - distorting proteins , where the protein binding can be treated as the excitation of `` kink '' or `` unwinding '' defect . the change in the linking number distribution",
    "can then be related to the binding affinity , the bending angle , and unwinding angle induced by protein binding .    in summary ,",
    "we have predicted the temperature dependence of linking number distributions of small circular dnas in the temperature range 20 - 55 degrees celsius .",
    "this temperature range is convenient for experimental studies . for temperatures below 37 degrees celsius",
    ", one can use the t4 ligase to close dnas into loops . for temperatures",
    "higher than 37 degrees celsius , one can use taq dna ligase ( it is known active within the range 45 - 65 degrees celsius ) to close the dnas into loops .",
    "once the linear dna is looped , its linking number is fixed , so the linking number distribution can be measured at any convenient temperatures . although our predictions are based on excitations of flexible defects , they should also describe the effects of excitations of `` kinks '' .",
    "the most likely candidate of the defect is the unstacking of one base pair step which is presumably a `` kink '' . for another candidate ,",
    "the melting of one or a few dna base pair , costs a much higher energy , therefore it is less likely to be excited .",
    "we expect to see increase in the variance of linking number distribution at high temperatures , which is likely associated with drift in the mean .",
    "we also emphasize an potential application for studies of dna - protein interactions by looking at the change in linking number distribution due to protein binding .",
    "finally , we note that our predictions of temperature dependence of linking number distribution of short dnas should not be understood as accurate quantitative predictions .",
    "this is because the energy model eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) used in the simulation contains two parameters , so there are certain degrees of freedom to choose the parameters .",
    "the choice of the parameters @xmath115 should agree with the predictions by wlc model for dna not sharply bent and at room temperature . from table",
    "[ tab_lk1 ] , we see that for @xmath116 @xmath14 , the linking number variances converge to those predicted by the wlc model .",
    "in addition , previously we showed that the choices of @xmath41 nm and @xmath117 @xmath14 agree with the force - extension curve measured in single - dna stretching experiments , and the `` j - factor '' measurement of @xmath118 bp dnas @xcite . furthermore",
    ", this set of parameters also explain the `` j - factor '' measurement of @xmath119 bp dna at 30 degrees celsius reported in @xcite ( but note that another `` j - factor '' measurement of @xmath119 bp dna done at a lower temperature 21 degrees celsius agreed with the prediction by the traditional wlc model @xcite ) .",
    "if one chooses a larger @xmath31 , then @xmath33 becomes correspondingly smaller in order to be in agreement with the experiments .",
    "however , our predictions of the temperature dependence of linking number distribution of short dnas should still qualitatively hold .",

    "<S> the predictions can be easily investigated in experiments , providing a new method to study the micromechanics of sharply bent dnas and the thermal stability of specific dna sequences . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the predictions are directly applicable to the studies of binding of dna distorting proteins that can locally reduce dna rigidity , form dna kinks , or introduce local unwinding . </S>"
