    "the gravitational - wave driven chandrasekhar - friedman - schutz ( cfs ) instability @xcite associated with r - modes @xcite in rotating neutron stars has attracted considerable attention in recent years .",
    "the r - mode gravitational waves could provide an explanation for the low spin - rates of young neutron stars as they provide a spindown mechanism that could explain why accreting pulsars in low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ) do not spin up to their braking - frequency",
    ". moreover , r - mode gravitational waves may be detectable by groundbased detectors in the near future @xcite , although there is still much discussion about the r - mode saturation amplitude , see for instance @xcite . despite the possibly low saturation amplitude ,",
    "r - modes could even be observed through their electromagnetic signatures in burst oscillations of lmxb , see @xcite .",
    "nearly 30 years of observations of binary pulsars and lmxb reveal rotation frequencies up to 716hz @xcite . for these pulsars ,",
    "rotational effects on the r - mode frequency have to be considered .",
    "it is also believed that accretion as well as r - mode oscillations could drive a star into differential rotation , while magnetic braking can damp this effect @xcite .",
    "still , a small amount of differential rotation may be present in all lmxb pulsars and its effect on the r - mode frequency could be relevant .",
    "differential rotation can also be an important ingredient when considering very young neutron stars or hypermassive neutron star remnants from binary mergers ( see @xcite for a recent study ) .",
    "the effect of differential rotation on the frequencies of stellar modes of oscillation in the cowling approximation was already investigated in a more preliminary way in @xcite ( f and p modes ) and @xcite ( f and r - modes ) .",
    "( oscillations of fast and differentially rotating stars in the cowling approximation were considered in @xcite , but their analysis was mostly focused on the f - mode instability . ) we present here a first study that incorporates fast rotation and a ( possibly ) strong degree of differential rotation in the analysis of the r - mode frequencies .",
    "we note here that only a few perturbative studies of rotating neutron stars have been performed without employing the cowling approximation .",
    "generic inertial modes were considered in @xcite , r - modes in slowly and uniformly rotating stars were studied in @xcite , and in @xcite a general perturbative formalism using spectral methods was presented and applied to f - modes .",
    "we also present here a first quantitative assessment of the accuracy of the cowling approximation for r - modes , comparing our results with those from @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : corrections ] we present a parametrization for the relativistic and rotational corrections to the r - mode frequency , including corrections from the differential rotation .",
    "our numerical results are detailed and analyzed in section [ sec : results ] , and we close with our final remarks in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "unless otherwise explicitely stated , we use units in which @xmath3 .",
    "the observed gravitational wave r - mode angular frequency @xmath0 is related to the rotating frame r - mode frequency @xmath4 by @xmath5 here for the dominant @xmath6 r - mode , where @xmath7 is the angular velocity of the star and @xmath8 is the dimensionless r - mode frequency in the rotating frame @xcite . for a slowly rotating newtonian star @xmath9 , independent of the equation of state ( eos ) @xcite .",
    "relativistic effects are quantified by the dimensionless compactness @xmath2 of the star . for slowly rotating polytropic stars over a range of astro - physically motivated compactnesses @xmath10",
    "the authors of @xcite found @xmath11 corresponding to a correction from its newtonian value of @xmath12 .",
    "note that @xmath13 is decreased and thus @xmath0 is increased with increasing compactness .",
    "the effect of fast stellar rotation including the leading order correction to the r - mode frequency was considered by @xcite and can be expressed as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the average density obtained numerically as ( total mass)/(total volume ) , and @xmath16 is dimensionless and of order unity .    since for rotating stars",
    "there is no unique radius to compute the compactness , we take here @xmath17 to be the volumetric radius , i.e. , the radius of the sphere that has the same volume as the star . for a typical compactness of @xmath18",
    "the correction is @xmath19 for stars with typical radius from @xmath20 to @xmath21 .    in order to consider the influence of differential rotation in the r - mode frequencies , we use the so - called _ j - const .",
    "law _ derived by @xcite , that has been widely used in the literature .",
    "( for more general rotation laws , see @xcite . ) in the newtonian limit , the j - const .",
    "law gives the angular velocity @xmath1 of the star as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the central angular velocity and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are dimensionless quantities rescaled in terms of the equatorial radius @xmath26 , following the notation in @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath27 controls the degree of differential rotation , but we will follow the literature and use the dimensionless parameter @xmath28 , such that stars with different radii but the same @xmath28 have the same amount of differential rotation .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] below we analyze the variation of @xmath16 with the compactness @xmath2 and we generalize eq .   to include the differential rotation correction as an additional term , @xmath29 .",
    "as we increase the number of degrees of freedom in our stellar model ( compactness , total angular momentum and increasing differential rotation ) , the simplicity of the newtonian formula for the r - mode frequency is somewhat lost .",
    "however , we gain finer and more detailed information on the frequencies , with non - negligible corrections that could change the value of @xmath8 by almost a factor 2 .",
    "we evolve the perturbation equations using a finite - differencing code in @xmath30 dimensions within the ` einstein toolkit ` @xcite .",
    "we use an outer 6-patch spherical coordinate system with an inner cartesian cube to avoid coordinate singularities .",
    "this coordinate setup is provided by the extension llama , see @xcite or sec .",
    "5.1 from @xcite for code tests and more details .",
    "the background models in the finite - differencing code are represented using spectral methods and computed with the ` lorene code ` @xcite .",
    "we use the same scaling function as lorene to adapt the surface to a ( round ) sphere for rotating models .",
    "both codes are available online and we also plan to make our code freely available .",
    "we ran our code for several sequences of polytropic stars with fixed polytropic index @xmath31 and total radius @xmath32 , compactness varying from @xmath10 , and uniform rotation in the range between @xmath33 . in our first code tests we compared results with values in @xcite , with very good agreement .",

    "[ fig2 ] we fitted our data to @xmath36 , where @xmath37 ( for a given compactness ) and @xmath38 , see eq .  .",
    "we can see that fit and data show very good agreement and that @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( i.e. @xmath13 and @xmath16 ) are both decreasing with increasing compactness .",
    "this trend , which was already known for @xmath13 , is to be expected because both the gravitational redshift and the frame dragging will act to decrease the oscillation frequencies as measured by a comoving observer ( see eq.(30 ) in @xcite ) .",

    "a quantitative measurement of this error has not been presented in the literature so far , and confirms the usual intuition that the cowling approximation should provide reasonably accurate results for r - modes ( for a study on the accuracy of the cowling approximation for f - modes , see @xcite ) .    a similar quadratic fit for @xmath43",
    "can be seen in fig .",
    "our results show that the dependence of @xmath16 with the compactness should not be neglected , since the difference between values for low and high compactness is almost 70% .",

    "6-models ] for a representative case : for a fixed differential rotation parameter , more compact stars will present a larger variation between the central and the surface angular velocity in the equatorial plane .",
    "this variation in @xmath1 can be understood as a more natural measure of the `` physical '' differential rotation of the star , and it ranges from 30% to 38% for the models presented in fig .",
    "[ 6-models ] .",
    "all models shown in fig .  [ 6-models ] have the same total angular momentum as the uniformally rotating model with @xmath51 .",
