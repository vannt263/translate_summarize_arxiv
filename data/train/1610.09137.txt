    "the elementary @xmath1 process of bremsstrahlung in electron - atom or electron - nucleus collisions has been thoroughly studied in the past @xcite .",
    "the measurement of polarization correlations between the incoming electron and the outgoing photon provides a sensitive test of the relativistic dynamics of polarized electrons in strong nuclear fields .",
    "profiting from recent advances in polarimetry @xcite , the measurement of polarization correlations has become a field of current interest , covering collision energies up to 3.5 mev @xcite .",
    "also in low - energy nuclear structure studies experiments with polarized electrons are planned , where knowledge on bremsstrahlung is crucial since it contributes essentially to the background of excitation spectra @xcite or to photon angular distributions from the coincident nuclear excitation and decay @xcite in case of heavy nuclei @xcite .",
    "sum rules for the polarization correlations have always been a matter of interest . a sum rule pertaining to elastic electron ( potential )",
    "scattering , @xmath2 , which involves the three correlation parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( relating to the initial electron spin polarization along the three coordinate axes ) , has been known for a long time @xcite .",
    "the equivalence between an elastically scattered electron and a bremsstrahlung photon at the short - wavelength limit , at collision energies high enough such that the electron s rest mass can be neglected , has therefore led to an approximate sum rule for bremsstrahlung in the case of strong nuclear fields @xcite , @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 describe the polarization correlations between the incoming electron ( with spin polarization along the coordinate axes as above ) and a circularly polarized photon , assuming that the scattered electron is not observed .",
    "most recently , pratt and coworkers have succeeded in deriving an exact sum rule which involves all seven polarization correlations ( between the incoming electron and a linearly or circularly polarized photon ) , which are allowed by the time - reversal invariance of the transition matrix element @xcite .",
    "this sum rule , @xmath8 holds independently of collision energy , nuclear charge number and photon momentum @xcite .",
    "the only condition for its validity is the restriction to a single partial wave in the final electronic state , as well as to only two of its magnetic substates ( those of opposite sign ) .",
    "a corresponding sum rule was also derived for photoionization , which can be considered as the reverse process of bremsstrahlung near the short - wavelength limit , and which is easier to handle theoretically @xcite .",
    "there is yet another sum rule , also put forth by pratt and coworkers @xcite , @xmath9 which is approximately valid at small nuclear charge numbers and high collision energies .    in the present work a sum rule of the type ( [ 1.2 ] )",
    "is derived for the polarization correlations occuring in the elementary process of bremsstrahlung ( where outgoing electron and photon are observed in coincidence ) .",
    "in contrast to the doubly differential case studied in @xcite where the final electronic partial waves add _ incoherently _ , the triply differential case considered below involves a _ coherent _ sum over these partial waves .",
    "this is the reason why the corresponding sum rule is exact ( for coplanar geometry ) without any restriction on the number of final partial waves .",
    "early calculations of the bremsstrahlung process , going beyond the plane - wave born approximation @xcite , have applied semirelativistic ( sommerfeld - maue ) wavefunctions for the electronic scattering states @xcite . however , for heavy nuclei , this approach is inferior to the dirac partial - wave ( dw ) theory which uses exact solutions to the dirac equation and which has become standard nowadays @xcite . since for very high collision energies",
    "the dw theory suffers from serious convergence problems , its applicability is restricted to energies below 30 mev @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii the partial - wave theory for bremsstrahlung is outlined and the sum rule is explicitly derived , profiting from a symmetry relation for the transition amplitudes .",
    "section iii provides a numerical test of the sum rules .",

    "atomic units ( @xmath11 are used unless indicated otherwise .",
    "in this section an evaluation of the spin - dependent triply differential bremsstrahlung cross section within the dw theory is given , from which the polarization correlations are obtained .",
    "finally a proof of the sum rule @xmath12 which is the equivalent of the sum rule ( [ 1.2 ] ) for the elementary process of bremsstrahlung , is provided . for the definitions",
    "see subsection b. note the identification @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we describe the initial spin polarization @xmath15 of the electron in terms of the coefficients @xmath16 of the up and down spinors @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite .",
