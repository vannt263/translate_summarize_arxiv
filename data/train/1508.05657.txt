    "we explore vector - valued functions @xmath11 on the vertex set of a finite simple graph @xmath25 .",
    "most of the notions introduced here are defined for general finite simple graphs .",
    "but as we are interested in lagrange extremization , morse and sard type results in graph theory as well as questions in the spectral theory of the laplacian on graphs related to laplacians of riemannian manifolds , we often assume @xmath1 to be a @xmath3-graph , which is a finite simple graph , for which all unit spheres are @xmath5-spheres in the sense of evako @xcite . in a first setup ,",
    "more suited for sard , for all except finitely many choices of @xmath26 , the graph @xmath27 is a @xmath10-graph , in a second setup , closer to classical calculus , we need to satisfy locally a maximal rank condition to assure that the graph representing the discrete algebraic set @xmath28 is a @xmath10-graph .",
    "+ the first part of the story parallels classical calculus and deals with the concept of level surface .",
    "it starts with a pleasant surprise when looking at a single function : there is a strong sard regularity for a @xmath3-graph @xmath1 : given a hyper - surface @xmath29 defined as the graph with vertex set consisting of all simplices on which @xmath30 changes sign , the graph @xmath31 is a @xmath5-graph if @xmath6 is not a value taken by @xmath0 .",
    "the topology of @xmath32 changes only for parameter values @xmath6 contained in the finite set @xmath33 .",
    "this observation was obtained when studying coloring problems @xcite , as a locally injective function on the vertex set is the same than a vertex coloring . before ,",
    "in @xcite , we just looked at the edges , on which @xmath0 changes sign and then completed the graph artificially .",
    "now , we have this automatic .",
    "we hope to apply this to investigate nodal regions of eigenfunctions of the laplacian of a graph , where we believe the answers to be the same for compact @xmath3-dimensional riemannian manifolds or finite @xmath3-graphs . with the context of level surfaces",
    "one has the opportunity to look at nodal surfaces of eigenfunctions , which are also known as chladni surfaces bounding nodal regions .",
    "+ with more than one function , the situation changes as the singular set typically becomes larger in the discrete .",
    "this is where the story splits . in the commutative setup , where we look at the zero locus of all functions simultaneously",
    ", sard fails , while in the setup , where an ordered set of functions is considered , sard will be true : as in the classical sard theorem @xcite , the set of critical values has zero measure .",
    "the difference already is apparent if we take two random functions on a discrete @xmath21-sphere for example .",
    "then simultaneous level set @xmath34 is a graph without triangles but it is rarely a @xmath35-graph , a finite union of circular graphs .",
    "the reason is that the tangent space is a finite set and the probability of having two parallel gradients at a vertex does not have zero probability . however ,",
    "if we look at @xmath36 on the two dimensional surface @xmath37 , we get a finite union of cyclic graphs . in general , we salvage regularity and sard by defining the algebraic set @xmath13 in a different way by recursively building hyper surfaces : start with the hyper surface @xmath38 , then extend @xmath39 to the new graph and look at @xmath40 inside @xmath41 .",
    "now a vector value @xmath42 is always regular if @xmath6 is not in the image of @xmath11 applied to recursively defined graph .",
    "this is the discrete analog of the multi - dimensional sard theorem in classical analysis .",
    "the order in which the functions are taken , matters in the discrete . but this is not a surprise as we refine in each step the graph and therefore have to extend the functions to the barycentric refinements .",
    "its only for sufficiently smooth functions like eigenfunctions of low energy eigenvalues of the graph that the answer can be expected to be independent of the ordering . + the graph theoretical approach is useful for making experiments : take a 3-graph @xmath43 for example and take two real valued functions @xmath44 on the vertex set @xmath45 .",
    "if @xmath6 is not in the image of @xmath0 , we can look at the level surface @xmath46 and extend @xmath19 to a function there ( vertices are now simplices and we just average the function value @xmath19 to extend the function ) . if @xmath3 is not in the image of @xmath19 , then the @xmath35-graph @xmath47 is a subgraph of @xmath31 .",
    "it is a finite set of closed curves in @xmath48 . in other words ,",
    "each connected component is a knot in the 3-sphere .",
    "unlike in the continuum , we do not have to worry about cases , where the knot intersects or self intersects .",
    "the sard theorem assures that this will never happen in the discrete .",
    "we only have to assure that the value @xmath6 is not in @xmath33 and @xmath3 is not in @xmath49 .",
    "+    the second setup , which defines discrete algebraic sets @xmath50 in the barycentric refinement @xmath51 of @xmath1 requires a few definitions . we need conditions under which these sets are nonsingular in the sense that they again form a @xmath10-graph , graphs for which the unit sphere @xmath52 is a sphere at every vertex . in general ,",
    "the situation is the same as in the continuum , where varieties are not necessarily manifolds .",
    "the definition is straightforward : define @xmath53 as the set of simplices of dimension in @xmath54 in @xmath1 on which all functions @xmath55 change sign simultaneously .",
    "the graph @xmath56 is a subgraph of the barycentric refinement @xmath57 of @xmath1 .",
    "conditions for regularity could be formulated locally in terms of spheres in spheres . in some sense , a locally projective tangent bundle with discrete projective spaces associated to unit spheres replaces the tangent bundle .",
    "it is still possible to define a vector space structure at each point and define a discrete gradient @xmath58 of a function .",
    "if @xmath1 is a @xmath3-graph , @xmath59 is a complete @xmath60 subgraph , then @xmath61 is defined as the vector @xmath62 .",
    "the local injectivity condition means that @xmath61 is not zero for all @xmath3-simplices containing @xmath63 .",
    "this leads to the sard lemma  ( [ sardlemma ] ) .",
    "but now , when changing @xmath6 , we also need to look at the values @xmath64 taken by the function @xmath0 and investigate whether they are critical . what happens if @xmath6 passes a value @xmath65 ?",
    "if @xmath66 is homotopic to @xmath67 , then the set @xmath68 is a @xmath5-sphere which by jordan - brower - schoenflies @xcite divides @xmath52 into two complementary balls @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "the poincar - hopf index @xmath71 @xcite is then zero . at a local minimum of @xmath0 for example ,",
    "the graph @xmath69 is empty so that the index is @xmath35 . at a local maximum",

    "+ the set of hypersurfaces @xmath73 form a contour map for which the individual leaves in general have different homotopy types .",
    "topological transitions can happen only at values @xmath33 of @xmath0 on the vertex set @xmath45 of the graph .",
    "we can relate the symmetric index @xmath74/2 $ ] at a vertex @xmath59 of @xmath1 with the @xmath75-dimensional graph @xmath76 in the unit sphere @xmath52 .",
    "we have called this the graph @xmath77 and showed that the graph can be completed to become a @xmath3-graph .",
    "this completion can be done now more elegantly .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , for @xmath78 for example , we get for every locally injective function @xmath0 a @xmath79-dimensional surface @xmath80 , the disjoint union of @xmath77 .",
    "we see that a function @xmath0 not only defines @xmath5-graphs @xmath81 but also @xmath75-graphs @xmath77 called  central surfaces \" for every vertex @xmath59 . + if we have more than one function as constraints , the singularity structure of @xmath82 is more complicated and resembles the classical situation , where singularities can occur .",
    "also the lagrange setup , where we mazimize or minimize functions under constraints , is very similar to the classical situation .",
    "the higher complexity entering with 2 or more functions is no surprise as also for classical algebraic sets defined as the zero locus of finitely many polynomials , the case of several functions is harder to analyze . in calculus , when studying extrema of a function @xmath0 under constraints @xmath19 , following lagrange , one is interested in critical points of @xmath0 and @xmath19 as well as places , where the gradients are parallel .",
    "lets assume that we have two functions @xmath44 on the vertex sets of a geometric graph .",
    "the intersection @xmath83 with @xmath52 is then a sphere of co - dimension @xmath79 .",
    "if we have @xmath79 constraints and @xmath1 is @xmath84-dimensional for example , then @xmath52 is a @xmath21-sphere and @xmath85 is a knot inside @xmath52 .",
    "this can already be complicated . by triangulating seifert surfaces associated by a knot",
    ", one can see that any knot can occur as a co - dimension @xmath79 curve of a graph .",
    "briskorn sphere examples allow to make this explicit in the case of torus knots . with more than one function ,",
    "poincar - hopf indices form a discrete @xmath35-form valued grid because changing any of the @xmath86 can change the euler characteristic .",
    "this allows to express the euler characteristic as a discrete line integral in the discrete target set of @xmath11 .",
    "there are now many poincar - hopf theorems , for every deformation path , there is one .",
    "+ if we look at the set @xmath87 , where all functions change sign , singular values for @xmath88 are vectors @xmath89 in @xmath12 for which the graph @xmath13 is not a @xmath10-graph or values @xmath90 taken on by @xmath11 on vertices @xmath59 .",
    "lets look at the very special example , where all @xmath55 are the same function .",
    "now , near the diagonal @xmath91 , there is an entire neighborhood of parameter values , where regularity fails .",
    "we see that the sard statement does not hold in this commutative setting .",
    "we therefore also look at the non - commutative setup , where we fix @xmath92 first , then look at the level surface @xmath40 on the surface @xmath93 and proceed inductively .",
    "sard is now more obvious , but the sets @xmath94 depend on the order , in which the functions @xmath55 have been chosen .",
    "this order dependence is no surprise in a quantum setting , if we look at @xmath55 as observables .",
    "it simply depends in which order we measure and fix the @xmath55 .",
    "+ there are analogies to morse theory in the continuum : in the case of one single function , we can single out a nice class of graphs and functions , which lead to a discrete morse theory .",
    "the geometric graph @xmath1 as well as functions on vertices are the only ingredients .",
    "one can now assign a morse index @xmath95 at a critical point and have @xmath96 .",
    "the requirement is an adaptation of a reformulation of the definition of being",
    "morse means in the continuum that for a small sphere @xmath52 , the set @xmath97 is a product @xmath98 .",
    "for example for @xmath99 , we have a saddle point , where @xmath52 intersects the level surface in @xmath84 points forming @xmath100 . in the enhanced picture ,",
    "where we look at the graph @xmath51 , we have this regularity more likely .",
    "one can extend the function to the new graph and repeat until one get a morse function .",
    "+ we can use graphs described by finitely many equations in order to construct examples of graphs to illustrate classical calculus like stokes or gauss theorem or surfaces to illustrate classical multivariable calculus .",
    "the notion of @xmath3-graphs has evolved from @xcite to @xcite , where it reached its final form . while finishing up @xcite a literature search showed that spheres had been defined in a similar way already by evako earlier on .",
    "+ the enhanced barycentric refinement graph @xmath101 is a regularizes graph which helps to study jordan - brouwer questions in graph theory @xcite and introduce a product structure on graphs which is compatible with cohomology @xcite .",
    "it also illustrates the brouwer fixed point theorem @xcite , as the fixed simplices on @xmath1 can be seen as fixed points on @xmath51 .",
    "the simplex picture is also useful as the dirac operator @xmath102 on a graph builds on it @xcite .",
    "the graph spectra of successive barycentric refinements converges universally , only depending on the size of the largest complete subgraph @xcite . +",
    "an other application of the present sard analysis is a simplification of @xcite which assures that the curvature @xmath103 is identically zero for @xmath104-dimensional geometric graphs : write the symmetric index @xmath105 in terms of the euler characteristic of the @xmath75-dimensional graph @xmath106 obtained by taking the hypersurface @xmath107 in the unit sphere @xmath52 . for odd - dimensional geometric @xmath3-graphs ,",

    "the regularity allows to interpret euler curvature as an average of two - dimensional sectional curvatures .",
