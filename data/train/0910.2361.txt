    "it appears that both @xmath223ba@xmath0 and @xmath224ba@xmath0 will be suitable candidates for an optical clock @xcite , but each has some advantages and disadvantages in controlling the systematic errors .",
    "for the 6s @xmath198 5d @xmath199 transition in @xmath224ba@xmath0 , it would be possible to use techniques similar to the measurement of the frequency in the optical transition in @xmath200sr@xmath0 mentioned earlier .",

    ", it is found that these systematic errors are small in ra@xmath0 which further supports along with its energy level locations that it will be one of the most suitable candidates for optical clock . in fact , a possible atomic clock with uncertainty in the order of @xmath251 seems feasible from these results along with the preliminary analysis of doppler s shifts @xcite in ra@xmath0 .",
