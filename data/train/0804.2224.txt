    "understanding how materials break is a fundamental open problem of science and engineering .",
    "the difficulties stem from the non - trivial dependence of the fracture strength on the characteristic lengthscales of the samples , as already noted by leonardo da vinci , who measured the carrying - capacity of metal wires of varying length @xcite .",
    "he observed that the longer the wire , the less weight it could sustain .",
    "the reason for this behavior is rooted in the structural disorder present in the material : the strength is dominated by the weakest part ( subvolume ) of the sample and its distribution can in principle be computed using extreme value statistics @xcite .",
    "longer wires have more weak parts and are thus bound to fail at smaller loads on average .",
    "the quantitative understanding of this statistical size effect is difficult , since the important low - strength tails of the strength probability distribution are not easy to sample and since the material properties are often history - dependent .",
    "for instance , in quasi - brittle materials such as concrete and many other composites , where sample failure is preceded by significant damage accumulation @xcite .    an important engineering scenario and a typical experimental setting is to study the size effect in the presence of a pre - existing flaw , _ a notch_. failure in this case is determined by the competition between deterministic effects , due to the stress enhancement created by notch , and the response of the disordered material around the defect to the stress concentration @xcite .",
    "this includes the stochastic damage accumulation .",
    "the effect of disorder can be treated in an effective medium sense by defining a fracture process zone ( fpz ) around the crack tip . for quasi - brittle materials , the size of this fpz",
    "may not be negligible compared to the system size .",
    "conversely , for small notches failure is more influenced by the fpz than the notch itself , and depends on statistical disorder effects .",
    "experimentally , it has been demonstrated that the critical crack may nucleate and propagate far from the pre - existing notch @xcite in that case .",
    "the existing theories on the size effect start from linear elastic fracture mechanics ( lefm ) .",
    "several formulations have been proposed in the literature and partly compared with experiments @xcite .",
    "the problem is how to extend lefm in the presence of disorder and concomitant damage .",
    "in lefm the griffith s stability criterion or equation for the maximum stress the specimen can bear reads @xmath0 . here",
    "@xmath1 is the linear size of the crack and the critical stress intensity factor @xmath2 is a function of the fracture toughness @xmath3 and the elastic modulus @xmath4 @xcite . in the size - effect law proposed by bazant for quasi - brittle materials",
    "@xcite , the griffith expression is generalized considering an additional lengthscale @xmath5 due to the presence of a fpz @xmath6 equation  ( [ baz ] ) takes into account the both limits of a very large notch compared to the fpz size and that of a very small notch . in the limit",
    "@xmath7 one has an expression that follows the lefm scaling , @xmath8 . in the opposite limit of @xmath9 ,",
    "the average strength is taken to be constant .",
    "( [ baz ] ) has been shown to be in agreement with several experimental data sets @xcite .",
    "however , three fundamental questions can be asked : first , does eq .",
    "( [ baz ] ) incorporate all the important effects ?",
    "second , what is the fracture toughness @xmath3 in the presence of disorder ?",
    "third , where does the fpz scale @xmath5 originate and how does it depend again on the disorder ?    in this work we clarify the role of the disorder in the failure of notched quasi - brittle specimens using extensive simulations of disordered lattice models for fracture @xcite .",
    "a brief account of the results for the rfm has been published in ref .",

    "we consider the failure of notched disordered samples and provide a microscopic justification of eq .",
    "( [ baz ] ) . studying the size scaling of strength by extensive numerical simulations is a difficult task due to the different length scales involved and the need of significant statistical averaging .",
    "we vary the disorder , which we model as a locally varying random failure threshold , and show that it plays a crucial role in determining the size effect .",
    "in particular , a lengthscale @xmath5 emerges from the simulations and can be shown to be directly related to the fpz size .",
    "finally , for notch sizes smaller than a critical length @xmath10 , we observe a cross - over to the inherent , sample - size dependent strength of the unnotched sample .",
    "we outline the scaling theory to account for these effects .",
    "we show that the rfm results are confirmed in the rsm and the rbm .",
    "we also study the growth of the fpz , showing that it is independent of the notch size @xmath1 and the system size @xmath11 .",
    "in the rfm @xcite , we consider a triangular lattice of linear size @xmath11 with a central notch of length @xmath1 .",

    "the larger @xmath14 is , the stronger the disorder .",

    "finally , a careful observation reveals that for small @xmath1 less than a critical crack size @xmath10 , the strength scaling crosses over from a stress concentration dominated lefm scaling [ eq .  ( [ baz ] ) ] to a disorder dominated scaling ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "that is , for @xmath97 , the strength scaling deviates significantly from eq .",

    "@xcite we presented a scaling theory that extends the earlier scaling law given by eq .",

    "( [ baz ] ) . for small notches , @xmath101 the strength is determined by extremal statistics as is appropriate in the limit @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "then one expects to see a weak size effect , typically logarithmic in @xmath11 . in real materials ,",
    "the scaling will depend on the damage accumulation and the defect populations that exist in the specimens .",
    "@xmath98 is not a constant however , as eq .",

    "the qualitative features of the data for different system sizes and disorders are the same in all the three models.,width=453 ]",
    "our numerical simulations allow to monitor the damage evolution prior to failure and can thus be used to study the development of the fpz . for a single realization of the disorder , we only see diffuse damage up to the peak load , and it is difficult to determine the size of the fpz . on the other hand , the fpz can be clearly measured after averaging the damage over several realizations of the disorder .",
    "hence , the size of fpz should thus be considered in statistical terms as the region around the crack tip where damage is most likely to occur .",
    "considering for simplification a projection of the average damage along the notch main axis direction , we obtain a profile that is decaying exponentially towards a homogeneous background value : @xmath117 ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the factor @xmath118 in the exponential comes from the fact that in our geometry the fpz extends from the two edges of the notch .",
    "we have analyzed the data for different values of @xmath1 and @xmath11 in order to check that the profiles do not depend on @xmath11 and on @xmath1 , as long as this is not too far from @xmath10 .",
    "for @xmath119 we naturally do not expect to see such a `` damage cloud '' around the original defect .",
    "however , it seems likely that one could measure @xmath5 around the most critical microcrack . recall that in this regime one expects the strength to saturate at @xmath120 .",
    "notice that the lefm stress intensity factor would indicate a @xmath87 -like divergence of the stress at the crack tip .",
    "it is evident that the observed exponential decay of damage profile @xmath121 is in contrast to a @xmath87 -like decay and should be naturally interpreted as a screening of the crack tip caused by the disorder .",
    "in fact , the fpz size @xmath122 depends on the disorder strength @xmath14 as shown in fig .",
    "the data can be roughly described by a power law relation @xmath123 . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , if we plot the fracture process size @xmath124 against the intrinsic scale @xmath5 resulting from the fits of the strength data to eq .",
    "( [ baz ] ) , we obtain a linear relation .",
    "hence , we can conclude that @xmath5 is indeed a direct measure of the fpz size .",
    "[ fig5 ] reports a comparison of the damage profiles in rfm , rsm and rbm .",
    "it can be seen that the results are qualitatively similar for all the three models considered .",
    "the value of the fpz size @xmath122 , however , differs slightly for the for the three models .",
    "the fpz progressively develops before the peak load by damage accumulation . to visualize this process , we have computed damage profiles at different values of the applied stress .",
    "one can then obtain the fpz size @xmath124 as a function of the stress . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , there is a gradual increase of @xmath124 with stress .",
    "this growth relates to the r - curve of the material @xcite which is usually defined in terms of the elastic energy released due to crack growth @xmath125 @xcite . in the rfm model",
    ", we can derive @xmath35 from the lattice `` elastic '' energy @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the conductivity , as @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the conductivity change after the crack has extended by @xmath130 such that @xmath131 , and @xmath132 is the initial conductivity .",

    "the data is shown for the current values @xmath133 $ ] in which @xmath134 can be extracted from the damage profiles with a reliable accuracy . in this regime",
    "the r - curves show in general two behaviors : an initial rapid increase due to the accumulating damage that changes the average conductivity , followed by a saturation as the fpz starts to increase even more rapidly .",
    "the conductivity change is a mean - field phenomenon that accounts for the total damage in the system , proportional to @xmath135 , and thus to the failure thresholds @xmath136 .",
    "the growth of @xmath134 is not expected to be so simply related to @xmath14 .",
