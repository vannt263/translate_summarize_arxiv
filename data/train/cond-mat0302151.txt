    "particular attention has been paid to one - dimensional systems with transitions from an active state into absorbing states , i.e. , frozen configurations from which the system can not escape . for these systems , so far , only two distinct universality classes have been firmly established : the directed percolation ( dp ) and the parity conserving ( pc ) universality class . while the former is ubiquitous and found in several systems with very different dynamical rules , the latter is only known to occur when extra symmetries are present @xcite .",
    "a model which has attracted quite some interest recently , because it may indeed belong to a novel universality class @xcite is the so - called pair contact process with diffusion ( pcpd ) . despite a rather intense activity in the past couple of years @xcite , the understanding of the pcpd and",

    "first , a similarity of the exponents @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the correlation length exponents along the time and space directions and @xmath9 the order parameter exponent ) with those of the pc class @xcite was reported , although in the pcpd there is no conservation of parity .",
    "it was later suggested that the pcpd could belong to a new universality class with exponents close to , but different from the pc values @xcite .",
    "it has also been argued that there could be two universality classes @xcite at small and large diffusion rates ( @xmath10 ) , or continuously varying exponents @xcite , or that scaling may even be violated @xcite .",
    "more recently the option of a slow crossover to dp was also discussed @xcite , although the general belief is that the pcpd belongs to a novel universality class @xcite .",
    "field theoretical methods , which have been successfully applied to other reaction  diffusion models @xcite failed so far to clarify the critical properties of the pcpd @xcite .",

    "we show that accurate numerical results from monte carlo ( mc ) simulations and density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) calculations convincingly demonstrate that for sufficiently long times and system lengths the exponents crossover towards the dp values .",
    "corrections to scaling are , however , rather strong and only an accurate extrapolation of the effective critical exponents allows to identify the final asymptotic critical behavior .",
    "we give evidence that in the near - asymptotic region the model shows effective exponents close to the pc class values , which suggests that the critical behavior of the system is described by two competing fixed points .",
    "our mc simulations exploit a technique known as multispin coding @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that in a simulation of 64 systems , each with @xmath11 sites , the occupation of site @xmath12 in the @xmath13th simulation is stored in the @xmath13th bit of 64-bit word @xmath14 $ ] . to perform the reaction @xmath15 in all 64 systems at a randomly chosen site @xmath12 and its neighbors ,",

    "other reactions require only slightly more elaborate logical operations .",
    "a direct implementation along these lines might result in 64 simulations , each of which statistically correct , but strongly correlated to each other because the site selection is shared . to alleviate this correlation without sacrificing efficiency",
    ", we employ random bit patterns that decide which reaction will be attempted in which system .",
    "the strong point of multispin coding is its efficiency . as illustrated above , only a few logical operations ( each usually carried out in a single clock cycle without delay )",

    "it would be interesting to study the same models at different values of the diffusion constant , as in the pcpd the onset of crossover behavior is quite strongly influenced by the value of @xmath10 .",

    "as mentioned above , for surface universality in pc processes there are two possible types of boundary conditions leading to two distinct surface exponents @xcite . in the first case ,",
    "the system is truncated at one edge and no particles are allowed to cross the boundary site ; we refer to this as _ reflecting _ boundary conditions . in the second case",
    ", particles are allowed to drop from the boundary .",
    "we implemented this type of boundary condition adding the boundary reaction @xmath182 ( with rate @xmath10 ) which mimics the diffusion of particles out of the system .",

    "figure [ fig09 ] shows the effective surface exponent @xmath183 versus @xmath97 in the case of reflecting boundary conditions , calculated both from the particle ( circles ) and pair ( squares ) densities .",
    "the same quantities are plotted in the inset in the case of absorbing boundary conditions .",
    "notice that indeed the results confirm the existence of two distinct sets of surface exponents and that the data from pairs and particles merge for sufficiently long chains , indicating that both quantities decay with the same exponent .",
    "our estimates @xmath184 in the former case and @xmath185 in the latter are obtained from a polynomial extrapolation in @xmath97 . as the finite - size effects are rather small ( see fig .",

    ".    the monte carlo simulation results @xcite for the critical exponents are @xmath186 and @xmath187 , for inactive and active boundary conditions , respectively . combining these results with the pc class correlation length exponent @xmath188 @xcite , one finds @xmath189 ( reflecting bcs ) @xmath190 ( absorbing bcs ) , in very good agreement with the dmrg calculations ."
