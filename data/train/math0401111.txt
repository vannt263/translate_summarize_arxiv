    "valuation theory was a fundamental tool in the work of zariski on desingularization of algebraic varieties .",
    "the key role in zariski s approach was played by what is now called the _ riemann - zariski surface _ introduced in  @xcite .",
    "it is by definition a collection of valuations .",
    "our aim is to use a version of the riemann - zariski surface of the ring @xmath0 of holomorphic germs in dimension two to study local singularities of plurisubharmonic ( psh ) functions .",
    "our thesis , as put forward in this paper and a forthcoming one  @xcite , is that valuations capture essentially all the information on a local singularity of a psh function in the plane .",
    "our study is local .",
    "we say that a psh function @xmath4 , defined near the origin in @xmath5 , has a _ singularity _ ( at the origin ) when @xmath6 .",
    "to study such a singularity , several quantities have been introduced .",
    "the limit of @xmath7 as @xmath8 exists  @xcite and is called the _ lelong number _ of @xmath4 .",
    "this number gives information on the growth of @xmath4 around its singular point .",
    "it coincides with the multiplicity of the curve @xmath9 when @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "more generally , given local coordinates @xmath12 and weights @xmath13 one can  @xcite associate to @xmath4 the limit of @xmath14 as @xmath15 .",
    "this limit is known as the _ kiselman number _ and gives more precise information on the singularity . the kiselman number of @xmath10 , @xmath11 coincides with @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the monomial valuation sending @xmath18 to @xmath19 and @xmath20 to @xmath21 .",
    "demailly  @xcite put these constructions into a more general framework .",
    "he defined a notion of psh _ weight _ ( see section  [ sec - dem ] below ) and attached to any psh function @xmath4 and any weight @xmath22 a _ generalized lelong number _ @xmath23 .",
    "three questions naturally arise : 1 ) are demailly s generalized lelong numbers related to valuations ?",
    "2 ) when do two psh weights define the same generalized lelong number ?",
    "3 ) what information on the singularity of @xmath4 can be recovered from the generalized lelong numbers ?    in this paper and in  @xcite we address these three questions . as an answer to the first , we prove that any valuation may be evaluated on psh functions ( theorem  [ thm - eval ] ) , and as such defines a generalized lelong number ( proposition  [ p6 ] ) . conversely we prove that any generalized lelong number associated to a ( sufficiently regular ) weight is an _ average _ of valuations ( theorem 8.7 ) , giving an answer to the second question .",
    "the averaging is with respect to a positive measure , the _ tree measure _ of the weight .",
    "the tree measure @xmath24 of a psh function @xmath4 is a positive measure ( of mass equal to the lelong number of @xmath4 ) on a space @xmath1 of valuations defined below .",
    "it is computed in terms of valuations , hence is determined by the collection of all generalized lelong numbers of @xmath4 . a slightly vague answer to the third question above is therefore that the tree measure @xmath24 contains essentially complete information on the singularity of @xmath4 .",
    "let us outline four ways to make this assertion more precise .",
    "first , two psh functions have the same tree measure iff their pullbacks by any composition of point blowups above the origin have the same lelong numbers at any point on the exceptional divisor .",
    "second , we show in  @xcite that the tree measure @xmath24 determine the multiplier ideals of all multiples of a psh function @xmath4 . in that paper",
    "we also use valuations to give an affirmative answer to the `` openness conjecture '' by demailly and kollr .",
    "third , we use tree measures to prove that every positive closed @xmath2 current @xmath3 , defined near the origin , admits an _ attenuation of singularities _ : there exists a finite composition of blowups , such that the pullback of @xmath3 decomposes into two parts , the first associated to a divisor with normal crossing support , and the second having arbitrarily small lelong numbers everywhere .",
    "the corresponding global result  for currents on compact complex surfaces  is an easy consequence , and has recently been proved by v.  guedj  @xcite in a more elementary way .",
    "his proof follows the method by mimouni  @xcite , who was the first , to our knowledge , to study singularities of psh functions through sequences of blowups .",
    "however , the global result does not imply the local one , and in fact our method gives stronger control on the second part of the decomposition , even in the global case .",
    "fourth , we explore the relationship between the singularities of two individual psh functions @xmath4 and @xmath25 , and the mass at the origin of the mixed monge - ampre measure @xmath26 . for general @xmath4 and @xmath25 , only inequalities in terms of lelong or kiselman numbers",
    "were known , see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  3 ) ,  @xcite . here",
    "we obtain much sharper estimate for @xmath27 in terms of the tree measures @xmath24 and @xmath28 .",
    "in fact , we obtain an exact formula under a mild regularity assumption on either @xmath4 or @xmath25 . the fact that any generalized lelong number of a ( hlder ) psh weight is",
    "an average of valuations is a consequence of this formula .",
    "the corresponding statement for homogeneous psh functions was obtained by rashkovskii .",
    "let us describe more precisely the content of the article .",
    "the riemann - zariski surface is classically endowed with a non - hausdorff topology .",
    "we described in  @xcite a natural way to turn it into a hausdorff compact space , called the _ valuative tree _",
    ", that is well suited for analysis .",
    "this space is the set @xmath1 of all normalized @xmath29-valued valuations on @xmath0 centered at the maximal ideal .",
    "the structure of @xmath1 , essential to our analysis here , is described in great detail in  @xcite ; we recall in section  [ generalities ] the results that we use in the present paper .",
    "of particular importance is the fact that @xmath1 has a natural _ tree structure _ : it is made up of pieces ( segments ) that are canonically parameterized by real intervals .",
    "the main difficulty in generalizing our results to higher dimensions lies in the fact that the structure of the riemann - zariski variety is not well understood in dimension three or higher .",
    "section  [ sec - psh ] contains basic facts on psh functions .",
    "in particular we recall the powerful approximation technique due to demailly .",
    "we also review some facts on kiselman numbers and ( generalized ) lelong numbers .",
    "in section  [ sec - eval ] we define @xmath30 for a ( quasimonomial ) valuation @xmath31 and a psh function @xmath4 .",
    "the function @xmath32 may be roughly characterized as the minimal , upper semicontinuous function satisfying @xmath33 for all holomorphic germs @xmath34 .",
    "our approach is as follows .",
    "if @xmath17 is monomial , then we define @xmath30 as a kiselman number .",
    "we extend this to @xmath17 in the dense subtree @xmath35 of @xmath1 consisting of _ quasimonomial _ valuations .",
    "such valuations can be made monomial by a birational morphism , a fact which allows us to define @xmath30 as a growth rate of @xmath4 in a semi - analytic _ characteristic region _ associated to @xmath17 .",
    "we also identify @xmath30 as a generalized lelong number .",
    "in section  [ sec - further ] we further investigate the function @xmath32 .",
    "in particular we show that a divisorial valuation may be interpreted as the ( normalized ) lelong number at a generic point on a suitable exceptional component .    for a fixed psh function @xmath4 we call the function @xmath36 on @xmath35 the _ tree transform of @xmath4_. it has very strong concavity properties ( some of which were noticed by kiselman  @xcite ) with respect to the tree structure on @xmath1 . in section  [ sec - pot ] , we describe a class of functions @xmath37 called _ tree potentials _ and having exactly these concavity properties .",
    "these functions were introduced and studied extensively in  @xcite .",
    "the set @xmath38 of tree potentials is the smallest closed convex cone in @xmath39 , containing all functions on @xmath35 of the form @xmath40 for @xmath41 , and closed under minima .",
    "theorem  [ riesz ] asserts that there is a one - to - one correspondence between @xmath38 and the set @xmath42 of positive measures on @xmath1 .",
    "the map @xmath43 is defined using a natural _ intersection product _ on @xmath1 .",
    "its inverse is a natural _ laplace operator _ @xmath44 .    in section  [ sec - transform ]",
    "we prove that the tree transform of any psh function @xmath4 defines a tree potential @xmath45 , hence a positive measure @xmath46 on @xmath1 , called the _ tree measure _ of @xmath4 .",
    "as noted above , the tree measure gives an extremely fine description of the singularity .",
    "although a complete characterization of measures arising from psh functions seems hard to obtain , we provide some partial results .",
    "attenuation of singularities for currents , as described above , is proved in section  [ sec - att ] .",
    "our proof is constructive in the sense that the composition of blowups may be recovered from the tree measure of the current . basically , the idea is to partition the valuative tree into subsets , each of which has small mass for the tree measure .",
    "the subsets define points on the exceptional divisor and the mass gives a bound for the lelong number at the point . in our approach ,",
    "the finiteness of a suitable intersection product , as used in the analysis by mimouni and guedj , is replaced by the finiteness of the tree measure .    in section",
    "[ sec - inter ] , we give sharp estimates of the mixed monge - ampre measure @xmath47 in terms of the tree measures of @xmath4 and @xmath25 .",
    "we also prove that generalized lelong numbers are averages of valuations , see theorem  [ p - upper ] .",
    "all results in this section rely on a reduction to the algebraic case , using demailly s approximation technique .",
    "in this section we give a brief review of the valuative tree as described in  @xcite . throughout the paper , we set @xmath48 , the ring of holomorphic germs at the origin in @xmath5 .",
    "this is a local ring .",
    "its ( unique ) maximal ideal @xmath49 is the set of germs vanishing at the origin , and its residue field is @xmath50 .",
    "we write @xmath51 for the completion of @xmath52 .",
    "it is the ring of formal power series in two complex variables .",

    "@xmath63 defined by @xmath64 is the unique minimal element of @xmath1 .",
    "note that any valuation on @xmath0 extends uniquely to a valuation on its completion @xmath65 , hence the valuation spaces attached to @xmath0 and @xmath65 are isomorphic .",
    "some natural maximal elements are the _ curve valuations _ defined as follows .",
    "to each irreducible ( possibly formal ) curve @xmath66 we associate @xmath67 defined by @xmath68 , where `` @xmath69 '' denotes intersection multiplicity . if @xmath66 is defined by @xmath70 , then we also write @xmath71 .",

    "<S> it yields an exact formula for the mixed monge - ampre mass of two plurisubharmonic functions . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> , any generalized lelong number can be interpreted as an average of valuations . </S>",
    "<S> using our machinery we also show that the singularity of any positive closed @xmath2 current @xmath3 can be attenuated in the following sense : there exists a finite composition of blowups such that the pull - back of @xmath3 decomposes into two parts , the first associated to a divisor with normal crossing support , the second having small lelong numbers . </S>"
