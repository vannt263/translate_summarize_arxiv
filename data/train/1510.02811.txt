    "protocols for achieving quantum control and locating the position ( positioning ) of individual members of nuclear spin ensembles form fundamental building blocks of large scale quantum registers , and may become essential tools for the resolution of the structure and dynamics of individual bio - molecules .",
    "the nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) center in diamond represents a promising physical platform for the realisation of these protocols even under ambient conditions .",
    "this is due to the favourable properties of the electron spin of the nv - center which , in addition to its long coherence times , include the possibility for its optical initialization and read - out together with its coherent manipulation by microwave fields  @xcite .",
    "an ensemble of @xmath0 nuclear spins in diamond located in the vicinity of the nv center constitutes an ideal candidate for building a robust quantum memory because of its extremely long coherence times .",
    "these nuclear spins can be detected and polarized by the nv center @xcite and , importantly , nv-@xmath0 entangling quantum gates can be implemented @xcite allowing as an example for the teleportation of quantum information between a nuclear spin and an electron spin in distant diamond samples @xcite .",
    "furthermore , nv centers can be implanted close to the diamond surface where they can detect the signal of nuclear spins above the surface with single spin sensitivity @xcite which suggests the possibility to examine the structure and dynamics of bio - molecules by means of carefully designed protocols @xcite .    to achieve individual addressing and control of nuclear spins it is necessary to determine the different hyperfine interactions between the nv electron and each nucleus . when inter - nuclear interactions can be neglected , individual nuclear spins with distinct larmor frequencies can be detected @xcite and their hyperfine fields can be measured by the variation of the direction of static magnetic fields @xcite or with the assumed ability to selectively polarize individual spins @xcite .",
    "however , in situations involving spin ensembles with similar larmor frequencies , single spin addressing and complete characterization of hyperfine fields are highly demanding .",
    "the situation is even more challenging when the nuclei are closely spaced and interacting between each other via dipolar coupling . in this context , the detection of a single two - spin cluster located at a suitable distance from the nv center and the identification of part of their interactions has been achieved  @xcite .",
    "however , a method to identify each spin in a spin cluster and thereby completely characterize the hamiltonian of the spin - cluster is , to the best of our knowledge , unknown .",
    "recently , it has been shown that for distant nuclear spins such that an applied magnetic field can be much stronger than the hyperfine interactions , one can significantly improve the addressing of individual nuclear spins @xcite .",
    "such a strong magnetic field is also required when nuclear control fields are applied , e.g. , for decoupling of nuclear dipolar interactions , since the nuclear zeeman energies should be much stronger than the amplitudes of nuclear control fields .",
    "importantly , however , under such magnetic fields the method for reconstructing the hyperfine vector described in @xcite is not useful anymore .",
    "this is because a magnetic field not oriented along the nv symmetry axis causes a different spin mixing in the nv electron ground and excited states .",
    "this destroys the optical qualities damaging , therefore , the initialization and readout of nv center .",
    "furthermore , it has been experimentally shown that tilting the magnetic field away from the nv axis reduces the collected photoluminescence , and the difference in fluorescence counts could be noticeable even when the angle between the magnetic field and nv axis is as small as @xmath1 @xcite .",

    "the method combines a robust dynamical decoupling ( dd ) protocol @xcite on nv electron spin with the presence of two radio - frequency ( rf ) fields acting on the nuclear spins , see fig .",
    "[ fig : figdrawing ] .",
    "one of the rf fields , the rf decoupling field , is used to eliminate the internuclear interactions while the other one , the rf control field , is responsible for achieving the selective spin manipulation .",
    "the measurement of the directions of hyperfine fields is achieved by using the phase of rf control field to break the symmetry of the system hamiltonian .",
    "remarkably , this protocol is insensitive to amplitude fluctuations in the rf control field .    without the need for magnetic field reorientation , which is time consuming in current laboratory set - ups and also affects fluorescence properties of nv centers , our method can implement fast detection , structure analysis , and control of spin ensembles . with the ability to work at strong magnetic fields without changing their directions , good qualities of the optical control on nv electron spin are preserved , and therefore our method has applications in the detection of homonuclear spins with chemical shifts which is relevant for structure determination of bio - molecules .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : theorymethod ] we describe the theory that is underlying individual addressing and control of nuclear spins in a nuclear ensemble by an nv center together with the methods to eliminate the internuclear coupling . in sec.[sec : positioning ] , schemes to measure the hyperfine interactions and resolving the structure of nuclear spin ensembles are presented with detailed numerical demonstrations , which include 3d positioning of a non - interacting spin ensemble , complete characterization of an interacting @xmath3 spin cluster , and 3d positioning and imaging of all the nuclear spins in a bio - molecule .",

    "when the spinning rate determined by @xmath41 exceeds the strength of @xmath17 , the internuclear interaction is averaged out .    in the general case , and because of the different values of the hyperfine vectors @xmath32 for different nuclei , the larmor frequencies @xmath36 have distinct values and the quality of the decoupling by magic spinning needs to be reassessed . in appendix [ sec : appendix ]",
    "we show that the dipolar coupling @xmath17 can still be suppressed when the rf decoupling field is strong compared with the differences of @xmath36 .",
    "the basic idea is the following .",
