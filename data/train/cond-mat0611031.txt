    "the variational states @xmath68 can even access the two _ types _ of string liquids described in the previous section - small string states and string condensed states - and can capture the distinction between them .    to see this , consider a string liquid state with @xmath73 .",

    "second , it agrees with the expected low energy physics of string condensed states",

    "in addition to clarifying our discussion of string condensation , @xmath84 can be used in numerical simulations to distinguish string condensed @xmath68 from normal @xmath68 . as a demonstration ,",

    "however , in more complicated cases ( such as states with non - uniform @xmath72 ) , such a numerical calculation would be necessary .",
    "finally , we would like to mention a physical interpretation of @xmath84 which will prove useful later .",
    "this interpretation is based on the duality between the classical @xmath77 loop gas and the classical ( 2d ) @xmath13 model .",
