    "the double pulsar system psr j0737 - 3039a / b was discovered by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this system consists of a 22-ms pulsar ( hereafter a ) and a 2.8-s pulsar ( hereafter b ) with an orbital period of 2.4 hours .",
    "this discovery has provided a laboratory for the study of relativistic gravity and gravitational radiation @xcite .",
    "the system has several strange features that challenge the current understanding of pulsars and provide an uncommon opportunity to improve pulsar theories .",
    "one of the most interesting properties is the observed modulation of each pulsar s signal by the energy flux from the other , as evidenced by each pulsar s modulation period being approximately equal to the other pulsar s pulse period @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed a technique for analysing the arrival times of the pulsars pulses and their mutual modulations which could yield the sense of rotation of each pulsar with respect to its orbital motion , among other quantities . in this paper ,",
    "a complementary technique is presented with the same objective , but using measured periods rather than arrival times .",
    "the principal benefit of our approach is that it is simpler and more intuitive . if the validity of either of these techniques is confirmed , not only will new insights be gained but also the correctness of the lighthouse model will be empirically assessed beyond dispute .    [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : one ]",
    "our method is identical in principle to the determination of the difference between two measurements of the earth s spin period  its sidereal and solar day .",
    "the difference between the two periods is caused by the kinematic effect of earth s rotation and revolution . because the earth rotates and revolves in the same ( `` prograde '' ) sense ,",
    "the solar day is about 4 min longer than the sidereal day .",
    "if the earth rotated in the opposite ( `` retrograde '' ) sense relative to its orbit , the solar day would be about 4 min shorter than the sidereal day .",
    "a similar relationship should be seen in the psr j0737 - 3039a / b binary system if the lighthouse model is correct , where the apparent period of one pulsar s pulses measured at the other pulsar  the other pulsar s `` modulation period ''  will be longer or shorter than the first pulsar s sidereal period if the first is a `` lighthouse '' rotating in the same or opposite direction as it is orbiting .",
    "although our technique can in principle be used to determine whether or not both a and b are spinning and the sense of such rotation with respect to their orbital motion , we focus only on determination of the spin of a in this and next sections , in order to avoid confusion",
    ". then earth s sidereal day , @xmath0 , is analogous to a s sidereal rotation period , @xmath1 .",
    "similarly , earth s solar day , @xmath2 , is analogous to the modulation period in b s , signal , @xmath3 .",
    "table 1 further illustrates the analogies between the earth - sun system and the double pulsar system , in terms of the various periods and their corresponding frequencies @xmath4 . in what follows",
    ", we will generally use spin and orbital frequencies instead of periods , because the frequency calculations are simpler .    to further understand the relationships among the rotation , revolution and modulation signals , consider the following suppositional extreme case .",
    "assume that the spin periods of a and b are both equal to the orbital period and that both stars rotate in the same sense as their orbital motion .",
    "then their emission signals will not modulate each other because each star can receive only steady energy fluxes from the other star . in any other case , it is clear that modulation of one pulsar s signal by the other is possible , and that the period of modulation will be affected not only by the rotation period of the pulsar causing the modulation but also its orbital period and rotation sense .    from the analysis above ,",
    "we have shown that as long as we can measure the modulation frequency of b s signal , we can determine the presence and sense of rotation of a.",
    "when a radiotelescope points to the system psr j0737 - 3039a / b , up to four periodicities may be received simultaneously ; namely a s and b s direct and modulated signals .",
    "they will be intermingled at the radiotelescope since they are spatially indistinguishable at the solar system . in this section ,",
    "we focus on the signals originating at a. ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : rotb ] for a discussion of signals originating at b. )      signals are observed from from pulsar a via two different paths : ( 1 ) the `` direct beam '' travelling directly from a to the solar system ; and ( 2 ) the `` two - legged '' beam emitted by a that first impinges on b , thereby modulating b s beam every time that a shines on b ; with the modulated signal then travelling from b to the solar system .",
    "consequently , the modulated signal encodes information concerning _ both _ b s and a s pulses .    details of the orbital geometry are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : orbits ] . note that it is the first leg of the two - legged path which provides the capability to distinguish the direction of a s spin , if any ; because it enables us to measure a s pulse period with respect to a another vantage point ( namely pulsar b s ) , in addition to our own .",
    "it will be adequate for our purposes to ignore kinematic modifications to source frequencies beyond order @xmath5 , leaving only the first - order doppler shift .",

    "for example , since the _ modulation _ of b s pulses can occur only at those orbital phases where b s pulses are present ( denoted `` bright phases '' in fig .",
    "2 ) , the sought - after modulation _ periodicity _ must also be visible only at those phases as well .",
    "[ indeed , the modulation phenomenon is only directly visible near the _ beginning _ of the first bright phase @xcite , although we believe it is worth deploying our technique with multiple trials on data from a wide range of bright phases . ]",
    "conversely , while the pulses arriving _ directly _ from a are observable at all orbital phases , the above procedures should filter out their presence in the resampled data.this ability to filter for the direct signal is key , especially if a pulsation ( no spin ) result appears .",
    "the success of the filtering out of the direct ray from a can itself be assessed by using our technique only on the ( b- ) dark phases , where only the direct a ray is emitted .",
    "an analysis of the apparent pulse train frequencies on the two equivalent paths from psr b to the ssb ( rather than the earlier case of paths originating at a ) leads to identical expressions as above , except with subscripts `` a '' and `` b '' interchanged .",
    "indeed , @xcite and @xcite show that a s pulses are modulated by b. however , the modulation has so far only been detected during the short ( partial ! ) eclipse of a by b. unfortunately , this modulation signal can not be used to determine b s rotation sense , because it arises from a different mechanism and hence the signal relationships differ from those derived above .    if a s signal modulation by b can also be found in the non - eclipse phase , b s rotation sense may be determined more easily than a s . in this case , with @xmath105 hz @xcite , the equivalent mean fractional frequency offset distinguishing the three possible spin states of b is a much larger @xmath106 .",
    "the data segments corresponding to the eclipse phases should be discarded in the analysis in order to avoid contamination from modulation originating by a different mechanism . while b s radio signal disappeared in 2008 due to relativistic precession of the spin axis @xcite , it is possible that its spinning magnetosphere could still modulate a s pulses .",
    "in addition , b s beam should eventually precess back into our line of sight .",
    "moreover , it may be worth using our techniques to investigate whether a s signal is modulated by b in the non - eclipse phase , although it is unlikely for b to modulate a s emission in the same way that a does b because the spindown power , which is proportional to @xmath107 , is much less for b than for a @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented a modulation pattern similar to drifting subpulses in the signal of psr b , but with a frequency of 44 hz , close to the pulse frequency of psr a. the presence and sense of rotation of a is encoded in the observed modulation pattern , and can be revealed through an arrival - time - based analysis @xcite or the frequency - based analysis presented above .",
    "our procedure offers the benefits of relative conceptual simplicity and close analogy with familiar phenomena in the earth - sun system .",
    "we present a frequency - based procedure , building upon that used in binary pulsar search software , to distinguish among direct , retrograde , or no rotation of psr a by searching synchronously for one of the three possible modulation signals over the full span of available data .",
    "although the lighthouse model has been widely accepted , there has nevertheless been no direct observational evidence in its support up to this time .",
    "a strength of our technique is its ability to provide such a test , empirically supporting or refuting the model .",
    "@xcite have shown that a s spin and orbital axes are aligned to within @xmath108 , but they have no direct means of distinguishing parallel from antiparallel alignment . by assuming parallel alignment , they are able to conclude that the second supernova , which created b , was relatively symmetric .",
    "therefore the presence and sense of the rotation , as revealed by this analysis , will further test their and others ( e.g. , @xcite ) evolutionary scenarios .    while @xcite also found that a s signal is modulated at b s frequency near a s eclipse",
    ", the mechanism is different and not dependent on b s rotation .",
    "if , however , the modulation is observed in the future away from eclipse , it will provide an easier test for b s rotation than does the approach delineated above for a.    our analysis can also be used on other binary systems discovered to possess phenomena caused by mutual interactions .",
