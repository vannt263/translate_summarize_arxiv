    "accurate measurements of the deuterium / hydrogen ( d / h ) ratio ( by number ) provide critically important tests for models of primordial nucleosynthesis , galactic chemical evolution , and the chemical properties of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) . among all of the light elements ,",
    "deuterium arguably provides the most stringent tests of our understanding of these three critically important topics , because the evolution of deuterium is predicted to be rather simple and the dependence of d / h varies steeply with baryonic density . @xcite and others have argued that deuterium was formed only in the big bang and that d is easily converted to @xmath7he , @xmath8he , and heavier elements by nuclear reactions in stars , a process commonly called astration .",
    "thus , as stars evolve , the interstellar medium ( ism ) receives deuterium - depleted and metal - enhanced material from stellar winds and supernova explosions , leading to a monotonic decrease in the d / h ratio with increased processing through stars",
    ". other light elements ( e.g. , @xmath7he , @xmath8he , @xmath9li ) have more complex creation and destruction histories or otherwise provide less sensitive tests of these theories ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "infall of less astrated gas , which is deuterium rich and metal poor , from the igm and small galaxies captured by the milky way galaxy , complicates models of galactic chemical evolution , because the rate of infall , its time and spatial dependence , and the timescale for mixing with other gas are poorly known .",
    "although based on different physical processes and relating to very different times in the early universe , the two main approaches for determining the primordial d / h ratio , ( d / h)@xmath10 , are now in agreement .",
    "the first approach is to measure the column densities of d  i and h  i in quasar absorption line systems . @xcite",
    "have determined a mean value of d / h = @xmath11 parts per million ( ppm ) by averaging the log ( d / h ) values using column densities @xmath12(h  i ) and @xmath12(d  i ) obtained from absorption line measurements of gas in the lines of sight toward five quasars .",
    "most of these measurements use high resolution spectra obtained with the _ keck _ telescope .",
    "since the observed gas has very low metallicity , these values of d / h are likely close to , but perhaps slightly smaller than , the primordial ( big bang ) value , ( d / h)@xmath10 . the measurement of d / h = @xmath13 ppm for the high velocity cloud complex c @xcite likely refers to gas located 610 kpc into the galactic halo with low metallicity , 1030% solar abundance @xcite , and this value should be somewhat smaller than ( d / h)@xmath10 .",
    "the second approach involves the analysis of data from the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) _ satellite and other cosmic microwave background experiments . assuming a flat @xmath14-dominated universe and other standard assumptions , several authors @xcite have derived tight constraints on the baryon closure parameter , @xmath15 , and the hubble constant . together with other constraints from the power spectrum of galaxy clustering and l@xmath16 forest data , they find that @xmath17 with a 1@xmath3 error of about 4% .",
    "these results are summarized in table  1 .",
    "the ratio of baryons to photons ( multiplied by @xmath18 ) , @xmath19 , is simply related to @xmath20 @xcite . in the standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( sbbn ) model",
    ", @xmath19 is the single parameter that predicts the primordial light element abundances including ( d / h)@xmath21 .",
    "for example , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite obtain ( d / h)@xmath22  ppm . using the same values of @xmath20 and @xmath19 but a more recent compilation of nuclear reaction rates @xcite , @xcite obtain ( d / h)@xmath23 ppm .",
    "the somewhat different values of ( d / h)@xmath10 arise from the different authors treating the light element nuclear reaction rates and error propagation somewhat differently ( cf . nollett & burles 2000 ) .",
    "we therefore use in the subsequent analysis two different values for ( d / h)@xmath10 , @xmath24 ppm @xcite and @xmath25  ppm @xcite .",
    "both values are consistent with the quasar absorption line result for ( d / h)@xmath10 .    beginning with observations by the _ copernicus _ satellite , data from high - resolution ultraviolet spectrometers on several satellites have been analyzed to measure d / h in the galactic ism .",
    "these results provide insight into the abundance of deuterium in the present epoch , which with measurements of various metal abundances constrain models of galactic chemical evolution .",
    "the _ international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) _ satellite and more recently the _ goddard high resolution spectrometer ( ghrs ) _ and _ space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) _ instruments on the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ have provided uv spectra of the ly@xmath16 absorption lines of h  i ( 1215.67  ) and d  i ( shifted by 82 km s@xmath26 relative to the h  i line ) , which are needed to measure d / h in the ism along lines of sight to stars located within a few hundred parsecs of the sun . the same analysis technique has been applied to hydrogen and deuterium lines higher in the lyman series that lie in the spectral range 9121025  , using data obtained with the _ copernicus _ , the _ interstellar medium absorption profile spectrograph ( imaps ) _ , and the _ fuse _ satellite . for a description of the _ fuse _ satellite and its operations , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the far - uv spectral range is essential for sampling more distant lines of sight using hot subdwarfs and white dwarfs as background sources , because the decreasing opacity in the higher lyman lines allows one to observe the deuterium lines without masking by the nearby very opaque broad hydrogen lines .",
    "for example , the dark core of the h  i ly@xmath16 line absorption broadens to mask the d  i ly@xmath16 line when the hydrogen column density @xmath27 , but at ly@xmath28 ( 972   ) the horizon for detecting the di ly@xmath28 line extends to @xmath29 .",
    "measurements of d / h using the higher lyman series lines are feasible to about @xmath30 ( cf",
    ". hoopes et al .",
    "2003 ) , where the density of overlapping h@xmath1 lines and the large widths of the interstellar h  i lyman lines determine the final horizon for such analyses .",
    "there are several subtle effects that can enter the analysis of d  i and h  i lines in the far uv .",
    "one disadvantage is that , for long lines of sight , there is an increased chance of weak features at large velocity displacements .",
    "an h  i feature near 82 km s@xmath26 can masquerade as d  i absorption .",
    "an important advantage is that the far uv includes a large number of lyman lines with a wide range of optical depths .",
    "thus , measurements of @xmath12(h  i ) and @xmath12(d  i ) can be based on several spectral lines in the lyman series .",
    "another advantage is that , for the higher lyman lines , the upper state lifetimes are long , decreasing the damping and better separating the h  i and d  i absorption for each line in the lyman series and between adjacent lines in the series .    since the very first of these measurements , a disturbing aspect of the d / h studies has been the wide range of measured values with no apparent pattern in the data or a convincing explanation for it .",
    "we address the first part of this problem with the latest data , including many measurements with _ fuse _ ; we conclude ( see   2 ) that the variations are real , and we show that there is a consistent pattern .",
    "we propose that the variations arise from time - dependent deuterium depletion onto dust grains ( see   4 and   5 ) , and we examine two critical tests ( see   6 ) of this model .",
    "the first test (  6.1 ) uses iron and silicon depletions as proxies for grain destruction , and the second test (  6.2 ) uses correlations of d / h with h@xmath1 excitation temperatures . we conclude ( see   7 and ",
    "9 ) that the most likely value for the total d / h ratio within 1 kpc of the sun is about 45% larger than the previously assumed value of @xmath3115 ppm , which provides a revised constraint on models of galactic chemical evolution . also , the inferred depletion of deuterium from the gas phase places constraints on the physics and chemistry of interstellar dust .",
    "see @xcite for an early version of this paper .",
    "using _ fuse _ data , @xcite measured ( d / h)@xmath32 along the lines of sight to two hot subdwarf stars , jl 9 and ls 1274 , located at distances of @xmath33 pc and @xmath34 pc , respectively .",
    "they also summarized the ( d / h)@xmath32 measurements observed by the previously mentioned satellites for 38 lines of sight to stars located between 3.2  pc and 2200  pc from the sun .",
    "these column densities are summarized in table  2 together with the new results for the pg  0038 + 199 @xcite , hd  90087 @xcite , lse  44 @xcite , wd  1034 + 001 and td1  32709 @xcite lines of sight and ( d / h)@xmath32 for lan  23 @xcite , which was not included in previous compilations owing to the large uncertainty in ( d / h)@xmath32 . table  3 lists the ( d / h)@xmath32 ratios computed from the measured column densities in table  2 , and the 1@xmath3 errors in ( d / h)@xmath32 are computed from the square root of the sum of the squares of the percent errors in @xmath12(d  i ) and @xmath12(h  i ) . when authors present their results for ( d / h)@xmath32 but not @xmath12(d",
    "i ) , we have computed @xmath12(d  i ) and its uncertainty to be consistent with the published values of ( d / h)@xmath32 and @xmath12(h  i ) .",
    "the ( d / h)@xmath32 measurements plotted in figure  1 show a complex picture that , as we shall see , seriously challenges previously held ideas concerning galactic chemical evolution .",
    "table 2 lists the most recent measurements of @xmath12(h  i ) and @xmath12(d  i ) , ordered by increasing @xmath12(h  i ) , for interstellar gas along the lines of sight to the listed stars , obtained using the _ fuse , copernicus , imaps _ , and _ ghrs _ and _ stis _ instruments on _ hst_. ( d / h)@xmath32 , which is derived from the @xmath35 ratio , is not always the same as originally reported because there are measurements of @xmath12(h  i ) obtained more recently with higher s / n and/or spectral resolution than the corresponding @xmath12(d  i ) measurements .",
    "this is typically the case when the only measurement of @xmath12(d  i ) was obtained with the _ copernicus _ satellite and @xmath12(h  i ) was later measured from _ hst _ spectra . for the sightlines to @xmath36",
    "col , @xmath37  cma , @xmath38  car , and @xmath39  sco , we list @xmath12(h  i ) and @xmath12(d  i ) for a specified velocity component ( see notes to table  2 ) rather than for the entire inhomogeneous line of sight , since the high quality spectra enabled the authors to identify the velocity components and measure the column densities in each component , although the components were likely not resolved .    for the sightlines that extend through the local bubble to more distant stars , we also list ( d / h)@xmath40 , the value of ( d / h)@xmath32 for the line of sight beyond the local bubble foreground , obtained by subtracting @xmath41 @xmath42 and @xmath43 @xmath42 from the measured values of @xmath12(h  i ) and @xmath12(d  i ) for the full line of sight .",
    "we assume that the local bubble extends to @xmath44 , since beyond that point the ( d / h)@xmath32 values are no longer consistent with a constant value .",
    "@xcite place the edge of the local bubble at @xmath45 , which corresponds to a 20 m  equivalent width of the na  i 5892    line formed in cold interstellar gas . within the local bubble ,",
    "we adopt ( d / h)@xmath46  ppm @xcite . given the complex three dimensional shape of the local bubble @xcite , these assumptions for its column densities are approximations , but they provide good first estimates of the foreground required for isolating the deuterium and hydrogen column densities of the gas lying beyond the local bubble .",
    "this is especially important for lines of sight that do not extend very far beyond the local bubble , but this correction is small for the more distant lines of sight because the local bubble contribution to the total is minor .",
    "those lines of sight that are definitely inside the local bubble are flagged as lbg in the eighth column of table  2 .",
    "figure 1 shows the ( d / h)@xmath32 ratios for the 47 lines of sight as functions of hydrogen column density .",
    "the ( d / h)@xmath32 ratios extend over an unexpectedly wide range , but @xcite proposed that these results naturally fit into three regimes . for @xmath47 ( in @xmath42 units ) , corresponding to sightlines extending to the edge of the local bubble near 100 pc , ( d / h)@xmath32 has a constant value of @xmath48 ppm , where the quoted uncertainty is the 1@xmath3 error in the mean for the 23 lines of sight within this regime .",
    "this constant value for the local ( d / h)@xmath32 ratio had been previously established based on _ hst _ data @xcite , but the addition of new lines of sight observed by _ fuse _ @xcite strongly supports this result .",
    "the very different values of ( d / h)@xmath32 measured in the distant ( @xmath49 ) and intermediate ( @xmath50 ) regimes beyond the local bubble are described at the end of this section .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and others have derived ( d / h)@xmath32 in an alternative way from the product ( d / o)@xmath51 ( o / h)@xmath32 . since the charge - exchange reaction between o  i and h  i is fast , the ionization of oxygen , hydrogen , and deuterium are very nearly the same . in the ionization equilibrium calculations for their best models ( models 2 and 8) for the local interstellar cloud ,",
    "@xcite find that each element is about 30% ionized .",
    "thus in the gas phase ( o / h ) = @xmath12(o  i)/@xmath12(h",
    "i ) = [ @xmath12(o  i)+@xmath12(o  ii)]/[@xmath12(h  i)+@xmath12(h  ii ] , and a similar relation can be written for ( d / o ) .",
    "empirically , the abundance of o relative to h shows little evidence for spatial variation @xcite . also , the outcomes for ( d / o)@xmath32 may not suffer from the effects of line saturation , as there are o  i lines that are optically thin .",
    "all three of these considerations should make o  i a good proxy for h  i. the ( d / o)@xmath32 ratio should therefore behave in a very similar way to ( d / h)@xmath32 .",
    "the problems with this technique are that uncertainties in two different measurements must be considered instead of one , and the amount of depletion of oxygen from the gas phase may depend on density @xcite .",
    "table  4 summarizes the recent measurements of ( o / h)@xmath32 .",
    "@xcite found that inside the local bubble , ( o / h)@xmath32 is constant with a mean value of @xmath52  ppm .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite find slightly higher values of ( o / h)@xmath32 for lines of sight extending beyond the local bubble with perhaps a slight decrease in ( o / h)@xmath32 at large column densities ( log n(h  i)@xmath53 ) .",
    "we assume ( d / o)@xmath54 ( @xmath5 ) , the mean value that @xcite find for lines of sight inside the local bubble , and compute the values of ( d / h)@xmath32 listed in table  4 . inside the local bubble , using the value of ( o / h)@xmath32 obtained by @xcite , we compute ( d / h)@xmath55  ppm .",
    "for values of ( o / h)@xmath32 derived from longer lines of sight @xcite , we find ( d / h)@xmath56 to @xmath57  ppm , depending on the number of lines of sight included . in their models 2 and 8",
    ", @xcite conclude that ( o / h)@xmath58 based on the discussion in their paper . ]",
    "ppm , leading to ( d / h)@xmath59  ppm .",
    "these alternative ways of determining ( d / h)@xmath32 are in agreement or smaller by 12@xmath3 compared with the direct measurement of ( d / h)@xmath46  ppm obtained by @xcite .    to put these numbers into perspective , we note the recent measurements of the solar ratio , ( o / h)@xmath60  ppm @xcite and @xmath61  ppm @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue that the @xcite value for the solar oxygen abundance is too low to explain the helioseismological determinations of convection zone parameters and surface helium composition , but a recent increase in the estimated opacity near the base of the solar convective zone @xcite minimizes the problem even for the @xcite low abundance . in  3 we argue that about 120  ppm of oxygen could be depleted on to grains if mg , fe , and si have solar abundances in the ism , but @xcite conclude that the ism abundances of these elements may be only 6070% solar .",
    "we therefore take the measured solar value ( @xmath62 ppm ) and that value less 120  ppm as a plausible range in ( o / h)@xmath32 .",
    "then the plausible range in the inferred ( d / h)@xmath32 = ( d / o)@xmath51 ( o / h ) is @xmath63  ppm to @xmath64  ppm .",
    "all of the local bubble values of ( d / h)@xmath32 measured directly and indirectly ( see table  4 ) fall well within this range . the differences among these values and with the directly measured ( d / h)@xmath46  ppm may represent measurement uncertainty and perhaps some systematic effects .",
    "an important new result noted for ( d / h)@xmath32 measurements by @xcite and emphasized by @xcite is that sightlines with large @xmath12(h  i ) appear to have systematically low values of ( d / h)@xmath32 .",
    "@xcite called attention to the clump of four low ( d / h)@xmath32 values at @xmath49 , which we refer to as the distant regime . whereas unambiguously low values for d / h in lines of sight extending beyond the local bubble have been known since the _ copernicus _ results for @xmath65  ori , @xmath66  ori , and @xmath38  car @xcite , the new results for jl 9 and lss 1274 , together with the ( d / h)@xmath32 values determined from _ fuse _ observations of hd 195965 ( @xmath67 pc ) and hd 191877 ( @xmath68 pc ) from @xcite and hd  90087 ( @xmath69  pc ) from @xcite indicate an emerging pattern .",
    "for these five long lines of sight , ( d / h)@xmath32 = @xmath70 ( standard deviation of the mean ) ppm , nearly a factor of two below the local bubble value .",
    "the intermediate regime for @xmath71 19.220.7 exhibits a factor of 45 range in ( d / h)@xmath32 : lines of sight to five stars have high values ( near 22 ppm ) , five stars have low values ( near 6 ppm ) , and nine stars have intermediate values . since ( i ) the _ copernicus , imaps _ and _ fuse",
    "_ data all show this wide spread in ( d / h)@xmath32 values in the intermediate regime , ( ii ) there does not appear to be any correlation of ( d / h)@xmath32 with galactic latitude , longitude , or distance , and ( iii ) the ( d / o)@xmath32 values also show a large spread , we conclude that the wide spread in ( d / h)@xmath32 in the intermediate regime is not due to instrumental artifacts or unknown systematic errors , but is rather a robust result that requires a sensible scientific explanation . we call attention to the five high data points in the intermediate regime with ( d / h)@xmath72 that will play an important role in our deuterium depletion model ( see  5 ) .",
    "the constant value of ( d / h)@xmath32 inside the local bubble suggests that this matter has experienced a similar history of nuclear processing , mixing , and deuterium depletion ( cf .   5 ) .",
    "this history consists of star formation in the scorpio - centaurus association some 10 myr ago and the creation of the local bubble by supernovae in the lower centaurus crux subgroup of the scorpio - centaurus association @xcite . outside the local bubble",
    ", interstellar gas could have experienced different chemical evolution resulting from different rates of astration , infall of nearly primordial material from the galactic halo or the igm , and insufficient mixing to homogenize the galactic ism .",
    "however , galactic chemical evolution models are faced with the severe challenge of explaining the factor of 45 range in ( d / h)@xmath32 ratios just outside of the local bubble and the clumping of low ( d / h)@xmath32 values for the lines of sight with the largest values of @xmath12(h  i ) .",
    "recent galactic chemical evolution models constructed to fit a wide range of constraints , including the abundances of deuterium , @xmath7he , @xmath8he , li , and heavier elements created by astration , generally predict a moderate astration factor for the total amount of ( d / h)@xmath73 in all forms , f@xmath74 ( d / h)@xmath10/(d / h)@xmath75 ( cf . * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "if we assume ( d / h)@xmath76  ppm , then the astration factors in the intermediate regime mentioned in the previous section would lie in the range of 1.25 to 4.6 .",
    "how could such a large range in astration factors occur over distance scales of only 100500 pc , but an apparently constant astration factor of 3.2 appear to be representative for longer distance scales ?",
    "galactic chemical evolution models generally include enrichment of gas in the galactic disk by the infall of less - astrated material from the igm or gas from neighboring small galaxies .",
    "for example , @xcite find that the local bubble value of ( d / h)@xmath32 could be explained by a mixture of 60% gas representative of the protosolar nebula ( with additional chemical processing over the last 4.6 gyr ) and 40% infalling gas with high ( d / h)@xmath32 and low metals representative of the large magellanic cloud . while this mechanism may explain the local bubble abundances , variations of the percentages to explain the wide range of observed ( d / h)@xmath32 values would require that the infalling gas be spatially concentrated into small regions of the galactic disk and then not be mixed .",
    "we note here that typical sizes for structures in the nearby infalling high - velocity cloud complex c are about 100 pc ( collins , shull , & giroux 2003 ) .",
    "we discuss the infall hypothesis further in   8 .",
    "both spatially variable astration and infall models may , in principle , explain the ( d / h)@xmath32 measurements , but they require extreme assumptions concerning the deuterium destruction and infall rates to explain the observed ( d / h)@xmath32 ratios . simulations with their three - dimensional supernova - driven ism model led @xcite to conclude that for the galactic supernova rate , it takes some 350 myr to completely mix the ism on distance scales from parsecs to kiloparsecs . in view of this relatively rapid mixing rate , we expect the total interstellar d / h ratio in all forms , ( d / h)@xmath73 , to show little variation on length scales less than 1 kpc , unless one invokes localized starbursts sufficiently strong for astration to produce significantly lower ( d / h)@xmath73 on a timescale shorter than 350 myr .",
    "both the variable astration and infall models fail to explain the absence of any correlation between the observed ( d / h)@xmath32 and ( o / h)@xmath32 ratios ( e.g. , draine 2005 ) , which should show a negative correlation for both models .",
    "we explore instead another physical process that could have a much larger effect on local values of the ( d / h)@xmath32 ratio than either astration or infall .",
    "figure [ fig : dvso ] shows observed values of ( d / h)@xmath32 and ( o / h)@xmath32 for all sightlines that have published column densities of h , d , and o with @xmath5 uncertainties of less than 0.1 dex for each .",
    "the error bars in the figure are @xmath5 ; because @xmath77 appears in the denominator of both abscissa and ordinate , errors in ( o / h ) and ( d / h ) are partially correlated .",
    "variations in astration or infall would produce anticorrelation of ( d / h)@xmath73 and ( o / h)@xmath73 .",

    "the median value of ( o / h)@xmath32 in figure  2 is 363  ppm , but it is likely that another @xmath81  ppm is locked up in grains in silicates or oxides ( assuming the grains contain @xmath8090% of solar abundances of mg , fe , and si , with composition mg@xmath82fe@xmath83sio@xmath84).o is negligible outside of dark clouds . ] from these well - characterized sightlines , we therefore estimate ( o / h)@xmath85 ppm in the local ism , slightly higher than but consistent with the recent estimate for the solar abundance ( o / h)@xmath86  ppm ( asplund et al .",

    "we will return to this point in   8 .",
    "it is important to recognize that all of the direct ( d / h)@xmath32 measurements refer to interstellar gas , whereas the galactic chemical evolution and primordial nucleosynthesis models refer to ( d / h ) in all forms , ( d / h)@xmath73 .",

    "* ) , and gas - phase abundances of such elements relative to hydrogen are much lower than the total elemental abundances .",
    "a similar process may preferentially deplete deuterium in the gas phase relative to hydrogen .",
    "this could lead to large spatial variations in the gas - phase ratio , ( d / h)@xmath32 , while the total deuterium abundance , ( d / h)@xmath73 , including both gas and dust , remains roughly constant .",
    "if deuterium depletion onto dust grains is important , then the total galactic d / h ratio can not be extracted from gas - phase measurements that ignore deuterium locked in dust grains .",
    "@xcite first proposed that the depletion of deuterium onto dust grains might explain the factor of two difference in ( d / h)@xmath32 values for the lines of sight to @xmath94  pup and @xmath65  ori obtained from the analysis of _ copernicus _ spectra @xcite .",
    "jura argued that the sticking probability of deuterium onto dust grains should be high and that deuterium should be more tightly bound to the dust than hydrogen , since the zero - point energies of deuterium - metal bonds are lower than for the corresponding hydrogen - metal bonds .",
    "numerical calculations of the chemistry of grain mantles by tielens ( 1983 ) showed that deuterium can be highly enriched in grains , because the lower zero - point energy for deuterium bonds as compared to corresponding hydrogen bonds strongly favors the formation of deuterated molecules like hdco on grain surfaces ( cf .",
    "turner 1990 ) , effectively removing deuterium from the gas phase in dark regions where grains are coated with ices .",
    "@xcite developed this idea further by noting that the c  d bond energy in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules is 0.083  ev larger than the c  h bond .",

    "contemporary grain models require a substantial amount of hydrogen - bearing carbonaceous material . from the relative strengths and profiles of different c - h stretching modes , @xcite estimate that @xmath8085% of the carbon in dust is in aromatic form , with h / c@xmath310.35 , and @xmath8015% of the carbon is aliphatic , with h / c@xmath312.1 .",

    "?    the most direct test of the deuterium depletion model would be to measure ( d / h)@xmath95 in interstellar dust grains .",
    "@xcite have performed this critical experiment by measuring the deuterium abundance in interplanetary dust particles containing amorphous carbonaceous material .",
    "they argue that sample l2009*e2 , which was captured in the upper atmosphere of the earth , originated in the ism because of the very high d / h ratios measured for various molecules ( which indicates formation at low temperatures where fractionation is important ) , the elevated @xmath110n/@xmath111n ratio , and the particle size distribution . for the whole dust grain sample",

    "it is interesting that high values of ( d / h)@xmath95 are only detected in amorphous organic ( i.e. , carbonaceous ) material in extraterrestrial samples @xcite .    as part of their paper summarizing the observational evidence for deuterated pahs ( hereafter called pads ) in the ism , @xcite point out",
    "that deuterium fractionations ( the ratio of deuterated molecules to undeuterated molecules ) for simple molecular species are typically 0.01 to 0.1 ( e.g. , markwick , charnley & millar 2001 ) and higher deuterium fractionations have been measured ( e.g. , parise et al .",
    "even triply deuterated ammonia @xcite and methanol @xcite have even been observed in cold interstellar clouds .",
    "@xcite then argue that pads are more stable , more abundant in the ism compared to many of the simpler molecules that show deuterium enrichments , and carry more h atoms per molecule .",
    "pads may , therefore , represent a large reservoir of deuterium - enriched species .",
    "@xcite then call attention to infrared emission features at 4.4  @xmath36 m and 4.65  @xmath36 m in iso spectra of the orion bar and m17 and identify these features as c  d stretching modes in pads . from the relative strengths of the emission bands of pads and pahs , @xcite estimate that the d / h ratio in these molecules is @xmath116 for the orion bar and @xmath117 for m17 .",
    "these ratios are about @xmath93 times larger than for atomic deuterium and hydrogen in the gas phase , ( d / h)@xmath32 .",
    "it is striking that the d / h ratios required to account for the observed 4.4  @xmath36 m and 4.65  @xmath36 m emission are comparable to the degree of deuteration of pah material argued for by @xcite , and which imply substantial depletion of d from the gas if this d / h ratio were characteristic of all of the hydrocarbon material in grains .",
    "thus , deuteration of pahs over time in a cold environment could be an important process for removing deuterium from the gas phase , and @xcite describe four different astrochemical processes by which this could occur .",
    "grains must be cold for the deuterium depletion process to operate on their surfaces .",
    "even in the 7000 k gas in warm interstellar clouds inside the local bubble , the grains are cold because at the densities of diffuse clouds , grain heating is by absorption of uv photons from stars rather than by collisions with the gas ; the grains cool by the emission of infrared radiation .",
    "the observed ir emission spectrum for wavelengths greater than 80 microns requires that typical grain temperatures are @xmath8018  k @xcite . because ( d / h)@xmath32 varies from one sightline to another , d depletion and return of d to the gas must be dynamic processes",
    "what is the timescale for d depletion ?",
    "@xcite considers reaction of d@xmath118 ions with neutral pahs , and reaction of d atoms with pah@xmath118 ions , arguing that the impinging d will become chemically bound in the pah , displacing a previously - bound h if necessary . considering the charge distribution of the pah population under `` cold neutral medium '' conditions ( @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121  k ) , @xcite estimates that the timescale for a d atom to collide with a charged pah is @xmath802  myr . if no processes act to return d to the gas phase , d depletion by a factor of @xmath122 could therefore be achieved in only 2  myr . in more diffuse regions ,",
    "the timescale will be longer .",
    "for `` warm neutral medium '' conditions ( @xmath123 , @xmath120 , @xmath124  k ) , a similar calculation gives a much longer d depletion time of @xmath8050  myr .",
    "therefore it appears that d depletion will be dominated by the cooler , denser regions where gas - grain collision rates are high .",
    "an important point is that most of the surface area available for deuterium depletion is provided by the population of free - flying pahs , but this population is thought to contain only @xmath125  ppm @xcite , or @xmath801/3 of the total aromatic material , with the remaining carbonaceous material in grains with radii @xmath126   .",
    "how can the material in the larger grains become d - enriched ? in denser regions , free - flying pahs are expected to coagulate and become part of larger grains .",
    "the population of small pahs is presumed to be replenished by grain fragmentation in grain - grain collisions .",
    "thus there is steady interchange of material between pahs and large grains .",
    "the timescale for a pah to collide and coagulate with larger grains is @xmath8010  myr in the cold neutral medium , assuming that the larger grains have a total projected area per h nucleon of @xmath127 , and a characteristic velocity relative to the gas of @xmath128  km / s , driven by mhd turbulence @xcite .",
    "in warm neutral medium conditions , this timescale becomes very long ; once again , it appears that the exchange of matter between pahs and larger grains is dominated by processes in the cold neutral medium .",
    "therefore , the conditions are favorable for the time - dependent depletion of deuterium from the gas phase due to local events without changing ( d / h)@xmath73 significantly by either astration or infall of less - astrated gas .",
    "we now apply the deuterium depletion model to the three - regime interpretation of the ( d / h)@xmath32 data presented in figure  1 .",
    "the measurements of ( d / h)@xmath32 in the local bubble are for gas in warm clouds ( @xmath129  k ) embedded in a hot gas bubble created by supernova events , which likely occured in the lower centaurus crux subgroup of the scorpio - centaurus association during the last 10  myr @xcite .",
    "the local bubble was last reheated and presumably shocked by a supernova event 12 myr ago @xcite .",
    "if the local interstellar cloud is representative @xcite , typical column densities for the warm clouds in the local bubble are @xmath130  @xmath42 ( see table 2 ) .",
    "the origin of these clouds is uncertain .",
    "it is possible that they consist of material that has cooled after being heated by thermal conduction or turbulent mixing with hot gas . in this case",
    "some fraction of deuterium in grains might have been returned to the gas by thermal sputtering while the gas was sufficiently hot for this to be effective . without knowledge of the thermal history of individual local bubble gas clouds ,",
    "it is not possible to predict what values of ( d / h)@xmath32 are expected in this interpretation , but the observed value of @xmath8015  ppm appears to be compatible with this picture .",
    "alternatively , pre - existing neutral clouds might have been shocked by low - velocity shocks driven into the clouds by a sudden increase in ambient pressure . @xcite",
    "argue that the abundances of si , mg , and fe in the local interstellar cloud are consistent with grain processing through a shock with @xmath131 km  s@xmath26 . in this interpretation",
    ", grain - grain collisions would be expected to result in destruction of only a few percent of the refractory grain material like iron @xcite .",
    "since the condensation temperature @xcite of fe ( 1300  k ) is much larger than for c ( @xmath132  k ) to which the d is bound , we anticipate that grain - grain collisions , radiation , or other heating processes would strip d from grains before fe .",
    "since , as we will later argue , the total ( gas and dust ) value of ( d / h ) in the local galactic disk is about 45% larger than ( d / h)@xmath133 , we surmize that the shocks in the local bubble have only partially evaporated the deuterium - bearing grains that could have been formed in molecular clouds before the onset of star formation in the association .",
    "as we shall see in  6.1 , the modest depletion of deuterium in the local bubble corresponds to modest depletions of the refractory metals iron and silicon and , as described in  2 , also oxygen .",

    "lines of sight extending beyond the local bubble should pass though either recently shocked gas , not recently shocked gas , or a mixture of such regions . according to our time - dependent depletion model , the highest measured values of ( d / h)@xmath32 should indicate recently shocked regions where ( d / h)@xmath138 ( d / h)@xmath73 , and the lines of sight with low values of ( d / h)@xmath32 should indicate regions that have not been shocked for a long time and thus have severe deuterium depletion",

    "if there is , at most , one diffuse h  i cloud in a line of sight , then ( d / h)@xmath32 should reflect the conditions of warm interstellar gas near the sun that is partially ionized and likely has not had sufficient time to deplete an appreciable fraction of deuterium onto dust after the last shock .",
    "however , when a line of sight passes through several or many diffuse h  i clouds , the composite value of ( d / h)@xmath32 should be dominated by the abundances in these clouds where gas - phase deuterium can be highly depleted onto the cold grains even when the gas is not cold .",
    "thus lines of sight in the intermediate regime ( @xmath140 19.220.7 ) could contain little or no unshocked h  i gas or be dominated by such material , leading to a wide range of ( d / h)@xmath32 values .",

    "the fit parameters are listed in table  5 .",
    "although the correlation is only at a @xmath175 confidence level , we should ask why there should be any correlation at all . since the lines of sight are generally inhomogeneous ,",
    "most of the molecular hydrogen along a given line of sight should be located in cool or cold clouds and thus not be cospatial with most of the atomic hydrogen and deuterium .",
    "thus the properties of h@xmath1 , such as @xmath170 , could be independent of the depletions of d , fe , and si averaged over the line of sight .",
    "nevertheless , we have found a correlation of @xmath170 with ( d / h)@xmath32 and therefore indirectly with the depletions of fe and si .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath176 , @xmath170 should not be a good measure of the gas temperature but is rather determined by the balance of excitations and de - excitations of the lower levels of h@xmath1 with collisions likely unimportant .",

    "observations of more lines of sight with low values of @xmath12(h ) but containing h@xmath1 and further theoretical work are needed to verify the correlation and to explore other possible explanations .",

    "what could explain these discrepant data points and , for that matter , the scatter of data about the least - squares trend lines ?",
    "we list here several considerations that may play important roles in explaining the scatter , but this list may not be complete :      until now , we have assumed that the properties of interstellar gas along a given line of sight have constant values inside the local bubble and then a different set of constant values beyond the local bubble .",
    "this very simple approximation is invalid for most lines of sight that have been studied with sufficient spectral resolution to identify the different velocity components and their individual properties .",
    "if the properties of interstellar gas in the different components are significantly different , for example in temperature , ionization ( h  ii vs. h  i regions ) , and density , then different observables may be formed preferentially in different locations and thus not correlate well .",
    "one example is the correlation of ( d / h)@xmath40 with the temperature of h@xmath1 , as h@xmath1 could be present in only one of the components along the lines of sight . for lines of sight with low h@xmath1 column densities ,",
    "h@xmath1 could be found in relatively warm gas associated with h  i and neutral metals .",
    "for example , high - resolution spectra of @xmath65  ori obtained with the _ imaps _ instrument show h@xmath1 line profiles with similar velocity structure as n  i , o  i , and d  i @xcite .",
    "this could explain why @xmath170 is large for the the @xmath65  ori line of sight .",
    "one way of estimating the depletion of an element in a particular velocity component without information on @xmath12(h  i ) for that component is to reference the gas - phase column density of the element to another element like sulphur , which is not significantly depleted in h  i regions . @xcite",
    "have used this approach to derive d(fe ) and d(si ) for component 1 in the line of sight to @xmath36  col using _ ghrs _ echelle spectra .",
    "this low - velocity component , also called component a by @xcite , contains most of the neutral gas and h@xmath1 along the line of sight .",
    "tables  2 , 3 , and 6 include the @xcite data for component 1 .      for complex lines of sight with large @xmath12(h  i )",
    ", it is important to measure @xmath12(d  i ) from the higher lines in the lyman series to avoid line saturation that could lead to underestimates in @xmath12(d  i ) and therefore in ( d / h)@xmath32 .",
    "the 20 km s@xmath26 spectral resolution of _ fuse _ is inadequate to resolve the d lines or to separate velocity components in the line . in particular ,",
    "narrow components from cold gas could be saturated but not recognizable at the resolution of _",
    "fuse_. we have argued in   5 that the low values of ( d / h)@xmath32 for lines of sight beyond the local bubble could be due to the dominant role of cool diffuse clouds in which deuterium is largely depleted .",
    "such clouds would have narrow absorption features observable in metal lines .",
    "indeed , @xcite list a number of lines of sight with ca  ii absorption features with @xmath178  kms@xmath26 .",
    "the chances of this occuring grow with increasing @xmath12(h  i ) , but measurements of @xmath12(d  i ) in high members of the lyman series , which require high s / n data , decrease the probability that line saturation will occur .",
    "one can test for d line saturation by looking for an increase in @xmath12(d  i ) toward higher lines in the lyman series or from a curve of growth analysis ( e.g. , friedman et al .",
    "also , high resolution spectra of interstellar metal lines can identify velocity features that could have saturated d absorption .",
    "the blending of adjacent lyman lines with each other and with the many h@xmath1 lines will eventually set a limit to the largest value of @xmath12(h  i ) for which one can measure unsaturated d lyman lines , but this should not occur until @xmath179 is considerably larger than 21.0 @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have argued that anomalously small metal depletions compared to typical lines of sight with the same @xmath12(h  i ) could be due to h ii regions where hydrogen is partially ionized but metals with second ionization potentials greater than 13.58  ev , such as iron , silicon , and phosphorus @xcite , remain mostly singly ionized .",
    "positive values of d(si ) are consistent with si@xmath118 being the dominant ionization state and h being partially ionized . a good example of this is the line of sight to @xmath37  cma .",

    "@xcite identify four velocity components with most of the h  i column density in component c. we therefore list in table  3 the depletions for component c that include all ionization stages for hydrogen , silicon , and iron , d(si ) = @xmath182 and d(fe ) @xmath183 @xcite .",
    "the line of sight to @xmath37  cet also has a positive value for the silicon depletion , d(si ) @xmath184 .",
    "@xcite showed that one of the two velocity components toward @xmath37  cet has a very high temperature , @xmath185  k , likely indicating partial ionization of hydrogen .",
    "thus ionization corrections of presently unknown size should be applied to d(si ) for this line of sight , which would move its data point to the right in figure  4 .",
    "the high temperature of the gas toward @xmath37  cet is likely due to a recent shock , which is consistent with the high value of ( d / h)@xmath159 ppm for this line of sight .",
    "the @xmath139  vel line of sight has seven velocity components  three are h  ii regions , likely produced by ionization from the wolf - rayet star in the binary system , and four are h  i regions @xcite .",
    "the h  i regions contribute 89% of @xmath12(fe  ii ) , but the fractional ionization of hydrogen and @xmath12(h  i ) in each component is not known . the iron depletion listed in table  3",
    "was therefore computed from the line - of - sight integrated values of @xmath12(h  i ) and @xmath12(fe  ii ) , rather than from the column densities in the h  i components .",
    "inclusion of the unknown @xmath12(h  ii ) would shift d(fe ) to the right in figure  3 .",
    "since sulfur is not usually depleted , we estimate that 72% of the total hydrogen column density is located in the h  ii regions by summing the column densities of s  i , s  ii , and s  iii in each velocity component .",
    "although the inclusion of this amount of ionized hydrogen would shift d(fe ) for @xmath139  vel by 0.55 dex to the right in figure  3 , an unknown but considerable amount of fe could be doubly ionized , shifting d(fe ) by an unknown amount to the left .",
    "realistic calculations of the ionization of h and fe are needed to address this problem .",
    "ionization corrections can be important for lines of sight with small values of @xmath12(h  i ) because ionizing radiation can then penetrate the gas and preferentially ionize h compared to fe@xmath118 and si@xmath118 .",
    "for example , @xcite find in their ionization equilibrium models for the nearby ism that hydrogen is about 30% ionized while 96.5% of fe is fe  ii and 99.6% of si is si  ii .",
    "to avoid lines of sight where such ionization corrections are likely important , we reconsider the correlation of ( d / h)@xmath32 with d(fe ) and d(si ) but now remove the data for lines of sight with @xmath186 .",
    "this removes all but two of the local bubble lines of sight . in figure  6",
    ", we plot ( d / h)@xmath32 vs. d(fe ) for the 24 data points that meet this criterion .",
    "the slope is now steeper than for the full data set ( see table  5 ) .",
    "the spearman rank correlation test rejects the null hypothesis of no correlation with @xmath187 significance .",
    "figure  7 is similar to figure  4 , except that we remove the data points with @xmath186 and plot ( d / h)@xmath32 vs. d(si ) for the 11 data points that meet this criterion .",
    "the slope is nearly the same as for the full data set ( see table  5 ) .",
    "the spearman rank correlation test rejects the null hypothesis of no correlation with @xmath188 significance .",
    "the data are in excellent agreement with the linear fit , except for the one uncertain data point , @xmath36  col .",
    "the removal of lines of sight that are most likely affected by ionization corrections leads to steeper correlations of ( d / h)@xmath32 with d(fe ) and d(si ) , fewer discrepant points , and tighter correlations .",
    "the remaining scatter could be due to measurement errors ( especially for some of the _ copernicus _ data ) , inhomogeneous lines of sight , and different grain compositions .",
    "the ionization of h and d should be the same as they share the same bound - free continuum .",
    "one should not expect a simple one - to - one relation between ( d / h)@xmath32 and d(fe ) or d(si ) along a given line of sight , because deuterium and different metals may be depleted onto different types of grains or be located preferentially in different layers of the same grain .",
    "many authors ( e.g. , spitzer & fitzpatrick 1993 ) have argued that grains typically have hardy cores but more easily destroyed mantles .",
    "for example , iron may be concentrated in the grain cores and some deuterium concentrated in pads either free - flying or incorporated into larger grains .",
    "@xcite estimated the destruction timescale for grains by supernova - driven shocks to be 23 @xmath189 yr but the timescale for the erosion of grain mantles by weaker shocks is much shorter .",
    "we note that the five lines of sight that lie above the trend line in figure  3 ( @xmath139  vel , lan  23 , wd  1034 + 001 , pg  0038 + 199 , t1  32709 ) also have the highest values of ( d / h)@xmath32 ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "( feige  110 , the fourth line of sight with a high value of ( d / h)@xmath32 , does not have d(fe ) or d(si ) measurements . ) clearly , there is no simple one - to - one relationship between ( d / h)@xmath32 and metal depletion , although there are the general trends indicated by the least - squares trend lines . in figure  6 , where we have considered only lines of sight with @xmath190 to minimize ionization corrections ,",
    "all of the five high lines of sight are still present .    in figure",
    "3 the dashed line is drawn parallel to the least - squares fit to all of the lines of sight ( solid line ) but arbitrarily displaced upwards by 8.5  ppm . the dashed line is a good fit to the five high data points .",
    "the high values of ( d / h)@xmath32 for these five lines of sight could be explained by either a smaller than usual percentage of the grains being composed of carbon and thus few sites available for deuterium to deplete on or the evaporation of deuterium that was in grain mantles by weak shocks .",
    "if the slope of the dashed line is real and not an artifact of the few data points , then there is support for a smaller than usual percentage of carbon grains in these lines of sight . since the condensation temperature for carbon is much smaller than that for iron ( typically in the form of oxides )",
    "@xcite , a low percentage of carbon grains compared to iron grains is likely for some lines of sight .",
    "the most difficult column density to measure accurately is usually hydrogen because the lyman lines are very optically thick , they must be measured against an uncertain stellar background ( lyman absorption or emission lines ) , and they are very broad , which requires interpolation over a large wavelength range .",
    "the hydrogen column densities cited in table  2 are based on careful analyses that consider these and other effects .",
    "the most accurate values of @xmath12(h  i ) are generally obtained from analyses of _ stis _ , _ ghrs _ , and _ fuse _ spectra .",
    "we note that @xmath12(h  i ) for the feige  110 line of sight was obtained from the analysis of one _ iue _ spectrum .",
    "since the lyman-@xmath16 line lies near the end of the _ iue _ spectrum where the sensitivity is low and the echelle spectral orders are close together , it is difficult measure the background and continuum .",
    "while there is no evidence that the value of @xmath12(h  i ) listed in table  2 is more uncertain than the cited error bars , the feige  110 line of sight should be reobserved with a better spectrograph when feasible .",
    "the lan  23 line of sight should also be reobserved as @xmath12(h  i ) was obtained from a noisy low dispersion _ euve _ spectrum rather than from lyman line spectra . to test whether the less reliable values of @xmath12(h  i ) are biasing our conclusions , we plot in figure  8 only the data points for which @xmath12(h  i )",
    "was obtained from _ stis _ ,",
    "_ ghrs _ , or _ fuse_. the fit to the data and the parameters characterizing the fit listed in table  5 are similar to the results obtained when we included all of the data in figure  3 .      in figures  3 - 4 and 6 - 8 ,",
    "the measured @xmath12(h  i ) values enter the quantities plotted in both the x and y - axes , raising the possibility of inaccurate or false correlations . to eliminate this possibility ,",
    "we have plotted in figure  9 the @xmath191 $ ] ratio vs. @xmath179 for all lines of sight .",
    "we include in the figure the weighted least - squares fit to all of the data points ( solid line ) and the fit to only the lines of sight which extend beyond the local bubble ( dashed line ) .",
    "the essentially zero slope in the fit to the data beyond the local bubble indicates that the positive slope of the fit to the entire data set is determined by the low values of @xmath191 $ ] for lines of sight inside the local bubble .",
    "the zero slope beyond the local bubble indicates that on a statistical basis the deuterium and iron depletions are proportional .",
    "the scatter of the data about the two regression lines suggests different grain compositions along the various lines of sight or different processes that deplete deuterium and iron from the gas phase but that depletion is important for both species .",
    "while the scatter indicates that the depletions of d and fe are not proportional on individual lines of sight , the zero slope fit to the data beyond the local bubble indicates that on average the rates of depletion of d and fe appear to be proportional .",
    "we noted in  6.3.3 that in regions of low shielding ( @xmath192 ) from lyman continuum radiation primarily from hot stars , that hydrogen can be partially ionized , whereas metals with second ionization potentials @xmath193  ev will be mostly singly ionized .",
    "the second ionization potential of iron is 16.18  ev , whereas the ionization potential of neutral deuterium is the same as that of hydrogen .",
    "thus partial ionization of deuterium could explain the decrease in @xmath12(d  i)/@xmath12(fe  ii ) at @xmath194 .",
    "it may also explain the very low ratios for the short lines of sight to 36  oph and g191-b2b .",
    "@xcite found that hydrogen is half ionized in the local interstellar cloud , which has a maximum column density @xmath195 .",
    "this result could simply explain the factor of two decrease in @xmath12(d  i)/@xmath12(fe  ii ) between lines of sight with large and small values of @xmath12(h  i ) in figure  9 .",
    "we propose that the most plausible explanation for the wide range in ( d / h)@xmath32 measurements within about 1 kpc of the sun is that different amounts of deuterium depletion occur in different lines of sight .",
    "we have come to this conclusion because : ( i ) theoretical arguments suggest that deuterium atoms can replace enough hydrogen atoms in carbonaceous grain materials to explain low values of ( d / h)@xmath40 in the undisturbed ism , ( ii ) high ( d / h)@xmath95 ratios have been measured in interplanetary dust particles that likely came from the ism , providing an important proof of concept for the deuterium depletion hypothesis , and ( iii ) the correlation of large iron and silicon depletions in the gas phase , d(fe ) and d(si ) , with low values of ( d / h)@xmath32 strongly support the hypothesis that dust grains are an important reservoir for deuterium and that deuterium returns to the gas phase when the grains are disturbed .",
    "the deuterium - depletion model predicts that the most likely value for the ratio of deuterium in all forms ( gas plus dust ) to hydrogen , ( d / h)@xmath73 , for the local region of the galactic disk , ( d / h)@xmath196 , should be _ equal to or slightly _ above the highest measured ( d / h)@xmath32 ratios . if some deuterium remains on grains for these lines of sight , then the total amount of deuterium will slightly exceed the gas - phase value . in figure  1",
    "there are five lines of sight ( @xmath139  vel , lan  23 , wd  1034 + 001 , feige  110 , and lse  44 ) extending beyond the local bubble that have the highest values of ( d / h)@xmath197  ppm .",

    "given that we have selected the data points to be used in computing the mean from a larger sample , the errors are not gaussian , but we believe that our method gives the most representative value ( d / h)@xmath40 available at this time . since even for these five lines of sight some deuterium could be in the grains , ( d / h)@xmath203  ppm .",
    "even the higher estimate of the primordial d / h ratio ( see section 1 ) , ( d / h)@xmath23  ppm , implies a small deuterium astration ( or depletion ) factor for the local region of the local galactic disk , @xmath204(d / h)@xmath10/(d / h)@xmath205 . for",

    "there are also estimates of the d / h ratio in the protosolar cloud , ( d / h)@xmath214 , when the galaxy was about two - thirds of its present age . @xcite",
    "have inferred ( d / h)@xmath215  ppm based on measurements of @xmath7he/@xmath8he in the solar wind , measurements of the same quantity in jupiter s atmsphere , and the assumption that @xmath7he in the solar atmosphere has not undergone nuclear reactions .",

    "one can not directly compare ( d / h)@xmath214 with present day estimates of ( d / h)@xmath196 , because the sun has moved a considerable distance from its place of birth about 4.6 gyr ago .",
    "however , the similar values of ( d / h)@xmath214 and ( d / h)@xmath218  ppm suggest that most of the decrease in the total deuterium abundance in the ism may have occurred as a result of nuclear reactions in stars and subsequent transfer of deuterium - depleted gas into the ism during the first two - thirds of the age of the galaxy .",
    "it is fair to ask whether depletion is the only operative mechanism for changing the abundance of deuterium . @xcite",
    "have used the constancy of the ( o / h)@xmath32 ratios over a range of environments in the local part of the galaxy to argue that significant changes in the d / h ratios because of infall of lower metallicity gas are unlikely . while it is tempting to suggest significant and highly localized infall for the high d / h sightlines , such a large infall would dramatically lower the o i abundances along these sightlines . a large increase in the value of ( d / h)@xmath32 from 15 ppm to 22 ppm would require a highly localized infall of gas with ( d / h)@xmath219 ppm within a mixing time of about 350 myr @xcite .",
    "the fraction due to infall would equal more than three quarters of the mass of the gas along a given sightline .",
    "such a large infall of d - rich , but metal - poor , gas would also lower the measured ( o / h)@xmath32 ratios by more than a factor of three ; such low values are not observed .",
    "the constancy of ( o / h)@xmath32 compared to variations in ( d / h)@xmath32 thus argues against localized infall @xcite . although the infall mechanism is unlikely to explain the wide range of observed ( d / h)@xmath32 values , we do not rule out the possibility of another , as yet unknown , mechanism for increasing the d abundance .",
    "finally , we include a note of caution .",
    "@xcite have pointed out that the ( d / o)@xmath32 data show variations similar to those observed for ( d / h)@xmath32 , except that there were no high values at that time corresponding to those measured for ( d / h)@xmath32 .",
    "the relative uniformity of o  i / h  i allows o  i to be used as a proxy for h  i , with the advantage that for a given line of sight , @xmath12(o  i ) is much closer to @xmath12(d  i ) than @xmath12(h  i ) .",
    "therefore , the d  i and the o  i transitions in the _ fuse _ range have similar opacities , lowering the chances of systematic errors due to large differences in optical depth @xcite . a gas - phase ( d / h)@xmath32 ratio of @xmath220 ppm and the ( o / h)@xmath32 ratio of @xmath221  ppm measured by @xcite implies ( d / o)@xmath222 , nearly twice the mean measured value of @xmath223 @xcite .",
    "although such high values had not previously been published , @xcite report 3 new sightlines ( wd  1034 + 001 , bd+39  3226 , and td1  32709 ) with high values of ( d / o)@xmath32 , consistent with ( d / o)@xmath224 .",
    "the main goal of the _ fuse _ mission has been to obtain accurate measurements of ( d / h)@xmath32 for many sightlines in the milky way galaxy and beyond in order to measure ( d / h)@xmath10 and to obtain constraints on galactic chemical evolution . _ fuse _ has now obtained the data needed for accurate measurements of ( d / h)@xmath32 much further out in the galaxy and with higher precision than previous instruments . in our summary of the published measurements of ( d / h)@xmath32 obtained from _ fuse _ , _ hst _ , _ copernicus _ , and _ imaps _ , we find , following @xcite , that the ( d / h)@xmath32 measurements appear to fall into three distinct groups depending on the neutral hydrogen column density @xmath12(h  i ) to the target star . for lines of sight with @xmath47 , that is within the local bubble , the mean value of ( d / h)@xmath32 is @xmath48 ppm , where the uncertainty is the standard deviation of the mean . at large column densities ,",

    "there is a factor of 45 range in the high precision ( d / h)@xmath225 measurements with values as low as @xmath226  ppm ( @xmath38  car ) and as high as @xmath142  ppm ( @xmath139  vel ) . since this large range has been measured from spectra obtained by several instruments , it is not an instrumental artifact , but rather an observational result that requires an explantion .",
    "both large changes in the local astration rates and infall of d - rich and metal - poor gas from the halo or igm can not explain the large range in ( d / h)@xmath32 without predicting large variations in the local ism metal abundances , in particular ( o / h)@xmath32 , which are not observed .",
    "instead , we describe a time - dependent deuterium - depletion model in which much of the deuterium in the ism can reside on grains under the appropriate conditions . the theoretical basis for this model is the lower zero - point energy of c ",
    "d bonds compared to + c  h bonds . when the ism is undisturbed for a long time , grains are very cold , and deuterium can replace hydrogen on carbonaceous grains and perhaps other types of grains .",
    "we estimate that d / h in the grains can approach @xmath800.2 , thereby reducing ( d / h)@xmath32 to 6  ppm or lower . when a region of the ism is shocked or the gas comes close to a hot star , the grains are partially or fully destroyed , sending deuterium atoms back into the gas phase . in this model ,",
    "the value of ( d / h)@xmath32 for a given line of sight depends on the environment and past history of the grains .",
    "evidence in support of this model includes the measurement of high d / h ratios in interplanetary carbonaceous dust grains , which are likely interstellar in origin .",
    "since the conditions required from deuterium depletion are similar to those for depletion of metals like fe , si , and ti in the ism , the model predicts a correlation of depletions of these metals with low values of ( d / h)@xmath32 .",
    "we present data that strongly support the correlation for fe and si , and @xcite present the data in support of correlation with ti .",
    "the model also predicts that ( d / h)@xmath32 should be correlated with the recent thermal and ionization history of the gas , whereas the variable astration hypothesis would not be expected to show such a connection ; we find that ( d / h)@xmath32 has a significant positive correlation with the rotational temperature of the molecular hydrogen on the line - of - sight , further supporting the hypothesis that ( d / h)@xmath32 is affected by interstellar processes acting on relatively short time scales .",
    "we note that in the most recent discussion of galactic chemical evolution models , @xcite conclude that `` depletion of deuterium on to dust grains is the most likely physical mechanism proposed so far to explain the observed dispersion in the local data . ''    if this model is realistic , then the best estimate of the total deuterium abundance , ( d / h)@xmath73 would be the highest measured values of ( d / h)@xmath32 because these would be for lines of sight with minimum depletion of deuterium .",
    "we note that there are five lines of sight in the intermediate @xmath12(h  i ) regime with high values of ( d / h)@xmath32 .",
    "the weighted mean value for these four lines of sight is @xmath227  ppm ( standard deviation of the mean ) . since there could be some deuterium depletion even in these lines of sight , we conclude that the best estimate of the total d / h in the local disk region of the galaxy , after subtracting the local bubble foreground column densities , is ( d / h)@xmath218  ppm  ppm ( @xmath5 ) or @xmath228  ppm ( 3@xmath3 ) , and estimate that the column density - weighted mean distance of the emitting gas is about 2  kpc",
    ". since the beamwidth is @xmath229 , the beam averages an unknown amount of cloud and diffuse gas in and above the galactic plane . while it is difficult to compare this new result with our line of sight measurements over shorter paths , the value of ( d / h)@xmath32 obtained from the hyperfine transitions of d and h is consistent with our proposed value of ( d / h)@xmath196 . ] .",
    "this new estimate is @xmath230% higher than the value of 15  ppm recently used in some galactic chemical evolution models ( e.g. , romano et al .",
    "2003 ) , which is ( d / h)@xmath32 for the local bubble rather than ( d / h)@xmath196 .    two methods for determining ( d / h)@xmath10 based on data from very different times in the early universe are now in agreement",
    ". measurements of ( d / h)@xmath32 in five quasar absorption line systems have a mean value of @xmath11  ppm @xcite .",
    "analysis of data from the _ wmap _ and other cosmic microwave experiments yield @xmath17 . depending on the adopted nuclear reaction rates , ( d / h)@xmath23  ppm @xcite or @xmath25  ppm @xcite .",
    "galactic chemical evolution models attempt to explain the decrease in d / h from the protogalaxy , for which d / h is presumed to be the primordial value , to the present epoch where d / h = ( d / h)@xmath196 .",
    "nuclear reactions in stars and subsequent return of d - poor and metal - rich gas by sn explosions and stellar winds will reduce deuterium in the ism by the factor @xmath231 .",
    "models of @xcite , for example , predict that @xmath209 for a wide range of assumptions concerning the value of ( d / h)@xmath10 and amount of mixing in stellar interiors .",
    "this result can be compared with our results , @xmath232 or @xmath207 .",
    "these two results differ by @xmath233 and @xmath234 , respectively , from the predictions of the @xcite models . if , on the other hand , the low value of ( d / h)@xmath235  ppm for the five most distant lines of sight is representative of ( d / h)@xmath196 as @xcite proposes , then @xmath208 would be @xmath236 or @xmath237 , which are far larger values than the @xcite models predict .",
    "very recent galactic chemical evolution models @xcite can now accomodate values of @xmath208 as small as @xmath801.3 , consistent with our determination @xmath212 or @xmath238 , depending on the adopted value of ( d / h)@xmath10 .",
    "however , our empirical results for @xmath208 are smaller than @xmath239 , the lowest value for a model discussed by @xcite .",
    "we suggest that new galactic chemical evolution models should be developed to see whether smaller values of @xmath208 are consistent with the other empirical abundance and theoretical constraints that the models must fit .",
    "we also call attention to the need for more high quality data to better constrain ( d / h)@xmath196 and ( d / h)@xmath10 .",
    "in particular , we need better quality observations of the highly saturated lyman lines for which measurements of @xmath12(h  i ) may contain systematic errors of an unknown nature .",
    "also , the assumptions underlying the galactic chemical evolution models should be reexamined to see whether @xmath208 might be as small as @xmath801.25 without violating other constraints .",

    "<S> analyses of spectra obtained with the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) _ satellite , together with spectra from the _ copernicus _ and _ imaps _ instruments , reveal an unexplained very wide range in the observed deuterium / hydrogen ( d / h ) ratios for interstellar gas in the galactic disk beyond the local bubble . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that spatial variations in the depletion of deuterium onto dust grains can explain these local variations in the observed gas - phase d / h ratios . </S>",
    "<S> we present a variable deuterium depletion model that naturally explains the constant measured values of d / h inside the local bubble , the wide range of gas - phase d / h ratios observed in the intermediate regime ( @xmath0 19.220.7 ) , and the low gas - phase d / h ratios observed at larger hydrogen column densities . </S>",
    "<S> we consider empirical tests of the deuterium depletion hypothesis : ( i ) correlations of gas - phase d / h ratios with depletions of the refractory metals iron and silicon , and ( ii ) correlation with the h@xmath1 rotational temperature . </S>",
    "<S> both of these tests are consistent with deuterium depletion from the gas phase in cold , not recently shocked , regions of the ism , and high gas - phase d / h ratios in gas that has been shocked or otherwise heated recently . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the most representative value for the total ( gas plus dust ) d / h ratio within 1 kpc of the sun is @xmath2 ( 1  @xmath3 ) parts per million ( ppm ) . </S>",
    "<S> this ratio constrains galactic chemical evolution models to have a very small deuterium astration factor , the ratio of primordial to total ( d / h ) ratio in the local region of the galactic disk , which we estimate to be @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) or @xmath6 ( @xmath5 ) depending on the adopted light element nuclear reaction rates . </S>"
