    "quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) has proved one of the most successful theories in physics .",
    "one of its striking features was the explanation of the so - called lamb - shift , the splitting of the energy levels of the hydrogen atom .",
    "most of the results , however , are of perturbative nature , and very little is known concerning rigorous results starting from a well - defined ( hamiltonian ) theory .    a few years ago , bach , frhlich and sigal initiated a rigorous non - perturbative study of non - relativistic qed .",
    "they made a detailed spectral analysis of the pauli - fierz hamiltonian , which is a model appropriate for studying the low energy properties of qed , and which is the model we use in this paper . among other results , they proved in @xcite the existence of a ground state for small values of the coupling constant @xmath1 and the ultraviolet ( uv ) cut - off @xmath3 , which has to be introduced in the interaction term between the electrons and the photon field in order to obtain a well - defined hamiltonian . recently , griesemer , lieb and loss @xcite succeeded in removing these restrictions on the parameters .",
    "we refer to @xcite for an extensive list of references on the subject .",
    "our goal in this paper is to calculate the binding energy of one electron in the field of a nucleus of charge @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast to the case of a schrdinger operator without coupling to the quantized photon field , the bare mass  appearing in the hamiltonian is not equal to the physical mass . to obtain the binding energy as a function of the physical mass , which can be measured in experiments , and hence to compare the calculated binding energy with the measured one",
    ", one has to substitute the physical mass for the bare mass . to do this ,",
    "one first has to calculate the physical mass as a function of the bare mass , the coupling constant @xmath1 , and the ultraviolet cut - off @xmath3 .",
    "we do this via the dispersion relation , i.e. , the energy of a free electron as a function of the total momentum (= electron momentum + field momentum ) .",
    "there are three parameters in the problem : the coupling constant @xmath1 , the uv cut - off @xmath3 , and the nuclear charge @xmath0 .",
    "we consider the case when @xmath1 is small , but @xmath2 not necessarily small .",
    "i.e. , we first fix @xmath3 and @xmath2 and consider @xmath1 as a small parameter .",
    "our calculations are to leading order in @xmath1 .",
    "we give rigorous error estimates , but do not focus on optimizing the error terms .",
    "in particular , we do not have sufficient control on their behavior for large @xmath3 to be able to prove the finiteness of the result after removing the cut - off beyond leading order in @xmath1 .",
    "this remains an interesting open problem .",
    "steps in this direction were taken in @xcite , where the behavior of the self energy for large @xmath3 was studied .",
    "bounds on mass renormalization and binding energies were recently given in @xcite .",
    "we shall rigorously show that after renormalizing the mass the uv cut - off can be removed , at least to leading order in @xmath1 .",
    "more precisely , the binding energy , as function of the physical mass and the coupling parameter @xmath1 , has , to leading order in @xmath1 , a finite limit as @xmath4 .",
    "we thus obtain an expression for the ground state energy shift due to the presence of the radiation field , which holds to leading order in @xmath1 , and _ for all values _ of @xmath2 .",
    "it agrees with bethe s formula @xcite for small values of @xmath2 , but shows a different behavior for bigger values .",
    "we emphasize again that in our formula for the binding energy no uv cut - off appears , in contrast to bethe s formula , who used the dipole approximation for it s derivation and neglects the spin of the electron . in bethe",
    "s formula a logarithmic dependence on @xmath3 appears .",
    "bethe argues that a physically reasonable value for @xmath3 is @xmath5 , the energy needed for pair production of electrons and positrons to take place . by inserting this value for @xmath3 in his formula he obtains excellent agreement with experiments , at least for the case @xmath6 , i.e. , the hydrogen atom .    shortly after bethe s work",
    ", it was noted in @xcite that the lamb shift ought to be finite after removing the cut - off @xmath3 if one does not use the dipole approximation ( see also @xcite ) . by means of perturbation",
    "theory the lamb shift was calculated , for both @xmath1 and @xmath2 small , in @xcite .    our proofs below",
    "essentially show that second order perturbation theory is correct .",
    "i.e. , to obtain results up to order @xmath1 only the addition of _ one _ photon is needed .",
    "we use and extend previous ideas in @xcite , where results on the leading order of the self energy and the binding energy were obtained .",
    "( concerning the question of enhanced binding , see @xcite . )    the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the precise setting and introduce some notation that will be used throughout the paper . in section  [ massrensect ]",
    "we calculate the dispersion relation and thus obtain an expression for the physical mass in terms of the bare mass , i.e. , for the necessary mass renormalization .",
    "the binding energy is calculated in section  [ bindsect ] . in section  [ rensect ] it is shown that after renormalization of the mass , the uv cut - off can be removed , and a finite expression for the binding energy to leading order in @xmath1 is obtained . see theorem  [ renbindthm ] on page   below for the precise statement .",

    "we have thus proved :    [ renbindthm ] to leading order in @xmath1 , the renormalized binding energy , after removing the cut - off , is given by @xmath284 with @xmath285 and @xmath286 the positive operators defined in ( [ defg ] ) , ( [ deft ] ) and ( [ deftl ] ) .",
    "note that , by scaling , the right side of ( [ renbind ] ) is @xmath61 times a function of @xmath287 .",
    "this is of course clear from the viewpoint of physical dimensions , since , after removing @xmath3 , @xmath61 is the only energy scale in the problem .",
    "the function @xmath285 is monotone increasing and concave , with @xmath288 and @xmath289 because of the logarithmic factor appearing in ( [ gsmall ] ) , the right side of ( [ tbound ] ) is , for @xmath290 , much smaller than the second term in ( [ renbind ] ) .",
    "i.e. , for @xmath291 , the term with  @xmath286 is negligible compared to the term with  @xmath285 .",
    "note that if we neglect @xmath286 and approximate @xmath292 by @xmath293 we obtain exactly bethe s result for the ground state energy shift @xcite .",
    "for this result it is not necessary to include the @xmath38 field in the hamiltonian , since the logarithmic factor in @xmath292 for small @xmath294 is entirely due to the term @xmath295 in ( [ defg ] ) , which comes from the @xmath296 term in the hamiltonian .",
    "the part with @xmath297 , which stems from the @xmath298 term , is , when divided by @xmath294 , bounded as @xmath299 .    for @xmath287",
    "not too small , there is a significant difference between our expression ( [ renbind ] ) and bethe s formula .",
    "first of all , there is a different behavior of @xmath292 for large @xmath294 , and secondly the term @xmath286 contributes , with a different sign than @xmath285 .",
    "it would be interesting to evaluate the terms in ( [ renbind ] ) numerically , given the physical values of @xmath300 and @xmath0 . for small @xmath0",
    ", the result will essentially agree with bethe s expression , whereas for larger values of @xmath0 our formula should be closer to the experimentally observed value .",
    "* the appearance of the second term @xmath286 in theorem  [ renbindthm ] is essentially due to the fact that the physical mass was obtained at total momentum @xmath158 , whereas the ground state of an electron in the field of a nucleus shows a definite momentum distribution . in fact , a definition of the physical mass of the state @xmath169 by the relation @xmath301 where @xmath302 is the electron momentum operator , would account for a subtraction of a term similar to @xmath286 . from a physical point of view",
    ", however , this definition is not very satisfactory since one wants to compare the binding energy with the rest mass of the electron and not with a mass defined in dependence on the state of the system .    to see the order of magnitude of the shift of the binding energy due to the presence of the quantized radiation field to leading order in @xmath1",
    ", we now present a rough lower bound .",
    "the last term in ( [ renbind ] ) is positive and can be neglected .",
    "for the first term , we use concavity of @xmath285 and jensen s inequality to get @xmath303 using that @xmath304 and @xmath305\\big ] \\big| \\phi_0\\big\\rangle \\\\ =   2\\pi ( \\beta z ) |\\phi_0(0)|^2=2{m}^3 ( \\beta z)^4 \\ , \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] we get @xmath306 in nature @xmath300 , and therefore @xmath307 \\ .\\ ] ] inserting @xmath308 and @xmath6 for the hydrogen atom gives a lower bound on the shift of the binding energy of @xmath309 mhz , which is off the experimental value by a factor of about @xmath310 ( see , e.g. , the appendix of @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "this is of course only a rough lower bound , the true value given by ( [ renbind ] ) is probably much closer",
    ". it should be noted , however , that the shift considered here is only the one due to the quantized radiation field , which is smaller than the shift due to relativistic effects .",
    "due to the presence of the quantized photon field , the ground state is the only eigenstate of the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "all the excited states that exist without radiation field turn into resonances .",
    "these are metastable states that decay after a characteristic lifetime .",
    "a reasonable guess for the energies of these resonances to leading order in the coupling @xmath1 is to compute the expectation value of the hamiltonian in a state similar to the one we used for the ground state and that has proved to give the right answer to leading order .",
    "i.e. , we consider a state containing only one photon , but replace @xmath169 and @xmath241 by some excited state of the unperturbed hydrogen atom with corresponding energy .",
    "we denote by @xmath311 an eigenfunction of @xmath312 with principal quantum number @xmath36 , angular momentum @xmath313 , and corresponding energy @xmath314 ( which is , of course , independent of @xmath313 ) .",
    "doing this calculation and also the mass renormalization to leading order in @xmath1 , it is therefore natural to expect an energy of the metastable excited states , to leading order in @xmath1 , as @xmath315 note that the operator @xmath316 is not positive , but nevertheless invertible for almost every @xmath22 . the expression ( [ renbindd ] ) makes perfect sense if the integrals over @xmath22 in ( [ defg ] ) and ( [ deftl ] ) are interpreted as the cauchy principal value .",
    "the same discussion as for the ground state energy shift in the previous section also applies here .",
    "neglecting @xmath286 and approximating @xmath292 by @xmath317 gives the result of bethe @xcite .",
    "this approximation is valid for @xmath318 . for larger",
    "@xmath0 , our formula presumably provides a better description of the energy level shift due to the presence of the quantized radiation field than bethe s formula .    the correctness of the formula for the shift of the energy levels can best be tested on the classical lamb shift , namely the splitting of the @xmath319 and @xmath320 states , since this is an effect entirely due to the quantized radiation field , and there is no splitting due to relativistic effects .    _ acknowledgments .",
