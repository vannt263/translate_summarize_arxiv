    "homoepitaxial films of inp are commonly grown as buffer and cladding / waveguiding layers , setting the base for numerous types of semiconductor devices.@xcite the morphology of these films can have a crucial impact on the quality of the overgrown material .",
    "for example , poor quality buffers could result in structural defects propagating to the device layers , reducing the carrier mobility or affecting optical properties , and thereby degrading the performance of the device.@xcite    in general , an epitaxial process is required to fabricate materials with reproducible properties of the highest quality in terms of crystal structure , purity , alloy composition , surface morphology , etc . in most cases , material quality is controlled by the adjustment of the growth conditions , such as substrate temperature , gas / molecular flow and their ratios which , in metalorganic vapor - phase epitaxy ( movpe ) , will affect precursors diffusion , surface decomposition processes , nucleation , diffusion of adatoms and their insertion at specific crystallographic sites and steps.@xcite for molecular - beam epitaxy , a well - founded conceptual and computational framework has emerged @xcite since the pioneering work of burton , cabrera , and frank ( bcf).@xcite systematic studies based on surface diffraction measurements and scanning tunneling microscopy , in conjunction with extensive computational modeling have identified and characterized many of the atomistic processes , even in the complex setting of iii - v systems.@xcite the corresponding development for movpe has been comparatively slow , due in part to the limited availability of _ in situ _",
    "measurements.@xcite nevertheless , systematic _ ex situ _ measurements of growth morphologies , again in conjunction with theoretical modeling , have revealed the importance of precursor diffusion and decomposition at step edges in determining the nature and scale of surface morphologies.@xcite    epitaxy - ready substrates are prepared by cutting individual slices out of the bulk crystal at the desired angle with respect to the main crystallographic plane.@xcite in the case of inp , the crystallographic steps exposed after this cutting may be ideally terminated either with indium ( so called a - steps , with the substrate misoriented toward the [ 111]a planes ) , or phosphorus atoms ( b - steps , with the substrate misoriented toward the [ 111]b planes ) , or any combination of these two.@xcite depending on the miscut , the exposed surface can be close to singular or contain a dense periodic array of crystallographic steps .",
    "epitaxial overgrowth on such substrates may then proceed ( when truly `` epitaxial '' ) in one of three basic growth modes :  step flow , where the overgrowing layer is advancing each exposed step at the same rate , creating an exact copy of the underlying surface ; step bunching , where terrace formation is observed due to clustering of individual steps ; or island formation , when the growth of new layer is initiated only at the step edges , but also between steps , in which case no long range order is observed .",
    "if the growth conditions are not optimal , due to defect formation , the surface morphology can be corrupted and will not resemble any of the three main modes . for most applications ,",
    "step flow is the desired mode , as it leads to creation of atomically flat layers , without irregularities ( such as , in an extreme example , antiphase boundaries).@xcite    on the other hand , the role of small substrate misorientations for the iii - v system have been recently revealed for arsenide alloys ( e.g. gaas , alinas or inas ) grown by movpe,@xcite where complex surface organization , striking effects and state - of - the - art results on the material optical / transport properties have been reported . in those reports ,",
    "small changes of growth conditions significantly affected the epitaxial morphology . as usual , the growth conditions revolved around a few parameters , where the common variables were substrate miscut , growth temperature , growth rate and molar ratio between precursors injected into the reactor chamber ( reactor pressure , carrier gas and precursor choice were fixed in the given setup ) . crucially",
    ", the authors found a strong correlation between surface organization and material properties .",
    "what is even more relevant is that the authors linked the unusual variety of surface organization ( e.g.  from islanding , through step flow to periodic step bunches just by varying substrate miscut ) , to the intrinsic two - step movpe growth process : first adsorption , diffusion and decomposition of molecular precursors at step edges and , subsequently , adatom diffusion and incorporation .",
    "their model reproduced the condition for island nucleation as well as for the step bunching instabilities , linking this last process to the difference in molecular dissociation from above and below step edges.@xcite    despite the broad and primary commercial interest and exploitation of inp,@xcite only limited data are available in the literature on inp grown by movpe .",
    "only a small range of parameters / surface organization appear to have been correlated .",
    "for instance , the influence of small differences of substrate misorientation was partly discussed in ref .",
    "[ ] ( for substrates with offcuts of 0.02@xmath10.25@xmath1 toward ( 01@xmath2 ) ) and ref .",
    "[ ] ( for singular wafers and with misorientations of 0.2@xmath1 toward [ 110 ] , [ 111]a and [ 111]b ) .",
    "morphologies created during homoepitaxy on singular wafers ( with misorientation below 0.1@xmath1 ) were also investigated in ref .   with respect to the direction of the miscut . in ref .",
    "[ ] , the authors analyzed the effect of temperature on step bunching on vicinal surfaces in a larger miscut range ( from 0.2@xmath1 to 2@xmath1 toward [ 111]a ) .",
    "nevertheless , there is no comprehensive study of the organization of the movpe - induced crystallographic steps on vicinal surfaces , so a fundamental understanding of the fundamental kinetic processes is still lacking .    in this paper , we report a systematic study of the impact of growth conditions on the surface morphology of inp surfaces with small misorientations during movpe .",
    "we show several surprising effects and a remarkably broad variety of surface organizational modes , well beyond what has been observed in the arsenide ( gaas ) counterpart .",
    "the organization of our paper is as follows .",
    "the procedure used for our experiments is described in sec .",
    "the surface morphologies observed on vicinal inp(001 ) are described in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , with the presentation of the results grouped according to growth rate and v / iii ratio ( secs .",
    "[ sec3a ] , [ sec3b ] , [ sec3c ] ) and the effect of doping ( sec .",
    "[ sec3d ] ) .",
    "these results are analyzed in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , which includes a theoretical discussion based on an extension of the model in ref .",
    "one of the interesting aspects of our experiments is that we can examine the effect of the group - v species on the various steps of the growth kinetics .",
    "we summarize our results in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] , where we also discuss future modelling strategies .",
    "all samples in this study were grown by movpe at low pressure ( 80  mbar ) in a commercial horizontal reactor with purified n@xmath3 as the carrier gas and trimethylindium ( tmin ) and phosphine ( ph@xmath4 ) as precursors.@xcite 300-nm - thick single layers of inp were grown on perfectly oriented or slightly misoriented inp(001 ) substrates , which in most cases were semi - insulating fe - doped , with reference samples grown on zn- ( @xmath5-type ) and si - doped ( @xmath6-type ) wafers ( we anticipate no observed differences to result from the substrate doping , as no diffusion to the epitaxial layer is expected ) .",
    "the majority of the inp layers were grown as nominally undoped .",
    "the unintentional doping level is estimated to be well below @xmath7 , which is our detection threshold .",
    "we have also grown several samples using diethylzinc ( dezn ) and disilane ( si@xmath3h@xmath8 ) as precursors to investigate the impact they have on the surface morphology when incorporated into the inp matrix .",
    "doping levels were @xmath9 for zn and @xmath10 for si and constant across the layer , as confirmed by electrochemical capacitance voltage measurements .",
    "such carrier concentrations are considered moderate for inp - based semiconductor devices.@xcite    growth conditions were varied systematically across samples :  the estimated actual growth temperature @xmath11 varied in the range 520@xmath1c to 720@xmath1c , the v / iii ratio @xmath12 from 150 to 450 , and sample misorientation from nominally `` perfectly oriented '' to 0.6@xmath1 ( all with a tolerance of @xmath13 ) toward [ 111 ] a or b. the growth rate @xmath14 was kept constant at 0.7  @xmath15m / hr for most of the samples , with reference / comparison growth carried out at 0.35  @xmath15m / hr and 1.4  @xmath15m / hr . all together , more than 150 samples were grown in various conditions for this study , with several control growth runs performed to ensure the full reproducibility of the reported results . in all cases ,",
    "particular attention was paid to reactor environment quality and to temperature control by growing the samples only with reactor walls already baked and covered by previous growth runs .",
    "the growth temperature was estimated by emissivity corrected pyrometry .",
    "the relevant details are referenced below when a given example is discussed .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     our model will be used to analyze the morphologies in table  [ table1 ] , as this provides the most comprehensive temperature - misorientation ( toward [ 111]a ) matrix of data .",
    "these data and our fits are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] , with the arrhenius parameters for the kinetic coefficients appearing in ( [ eq1])([eq6 ] ) compiled in table  [ table5 ] .",
    "the focus of most of our discussion will be on processes occurring at step edges , but the prefactor for the surface diffusion of tmi merits some comment .",
    "the value @xmath16 , which may seem quite high in comparison with the range @xmath17@xmath18 typically used in such theories and simulations , actually conforms with estimates@xcite for large molecules .",
    "such large prefactors are due to jumps over several lattice cites , which is in contrast to the usual assumption of jumps of a single lattice unit .",
    "otherwise , the precise values in table  [ table5 ] are not as important as the trends they reveal as the growth conditions are varied .",
    "we first consider the morphologies at high phosphine flow rate @xmath19 .",
    "the trends in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] are similar to those seen on gaas(001 ) ( cf .",
    "fig .  3 of ref .",
    "[ ] ) , which was also grown under group - v - rich conditions .",
    "the direct incorporation of the adatom from the precursor occurs at a greater rate from above the step than below for both systems , but there is no asymmetry in the adatom step incorporation kinetics . indeed ,",
    "large ( i.e.  several tenths of electron volts ) variations of the energy barriers for the adatom diffusion and incorporation only weakly affect on the stability calculation , provided that the incorporation kinetics at the step edge are symmetric .",
    "we have enclosed the barriers for these processes in parentheses in table  [ table5 ] to indicate this fact . for these growth conditions , the instability of step flow to step bunching in inp(001 ) and gaas(001 ) is driven by an effective negative step - edge barrier induced by the asymmetric precursor incorporation kinetics.@xcite    an altogether different scenario emerges from the stability analysis at low phosphine flow rates , as can be seen immediately in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] . at lower temperatures ( @xmath20c and 560@xmath1c )",
    "the morphology of all substrates shows either discrete or diffuse islands ( table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "discrete islands indicate a growth regime far removed from step flow .",
    "the adatom density on the terrace is large , leading to a high probability of island nucleation and growth on the terraces . as the temperature",
    "is increased , the adatom density on the terraces decreases , so the growth nucleation and growth of islands decreases accordingly , with the islands showing some coalescence with steps , thereby indicating a transition regime between discrete islanding and step flow .",
    "the separation of stable and unstable regions of step flow is expected to be qualitatively different from that obtained with higher phosphine flow rates .",
    "table  [ fig5 ] shows that , while the asymmetry in the molecular step - edge incorporation rates has been maintained , an asymmetry in the _ atomic _ step - edge incorporation rates has been introduced , but in _ opposition _ to the molecular incorporation rates .",
    "this is the reason for the qualitative difference in shape of the curve that separates the stable and unstable regions @xmath21 .",
    "our calculations show that the profile of the curve @xmath22 separating the stable and unstable regions is very sensitive to the atomic parameters . with decreasing temperature ,",
    "the net incorporation current at steps becomes more negative , while that due to precursor incorporation becomes more positive .",
    "for certain growth conditions , the atomic current dominates , which suggests the onset of another instability through the appearance of mounds , a fact that has also been noted by vladimirova _",
    "et al._@xcite in fact , mounds have been observed on inp(001 ) during metalorganic molecular - beam@xcite and chemical - beam@xcite epitaxy .",
    "the interesting point from our perspective is that this morphology is triggered by the low phosphine flow rate and can therefore be avoided .",
    "homoepitaxy on perfectly oriented substrates resulted in the most homogenous surfaces ",
    "stable step flow was observed in the majority of cases over some temperature range , with step - bunching composed of a maximum of three steps observed near 650@xmath1c .",
    "the modification of the v / iii ratio had the most striking effect on the surface morphology .",
    "for @xmath23 , a growth temperature below 600@xmath1c was found to be insufficient to create useful surface organization for any misorientation of the substrate ( the exception being the substrate with a - steps with a misorientation of 0.6@xmath1 , where regular step organization was observed at 585@xmath1c ) .",
    "temperatures above 685@xmath1c led to defects related to three - dimensional growth .",
    "the mid - range growth temperatures provided more of a distinction between various substrates .",
    "step - bunching was observed in most of the cases but , depending on the surface misorientation and exact growth temperature , different features were formed on the surface .",
    "when examined in detail , the overlap of crystallographic steps could take diverse forms , like clustering of just two monolayers ( on perfectly oriented substrates ) , well organized , periodic micron - scale bunching ( cliffs observed on a - type substrates at 655@xmath1c ) , or a braid - like bunching of up to 40 monolayers ( on all vicinal surfaces grown at 630@xmath1c ) .",
    "this limited the optimal growth temperature to a quite narrow window of about 100@xmath1c . by changing the phosphine flow to @xmath24 ,",
    "most of the samples were eliminated by that restriction ",
    "stable , organized step - flow was observed even at 520@xmath1c and good surface morphology was obtained for growths conducted at temperatures of 720@xmath1c .",
    "there are several aspects of the surface morphology that can be addressed with modelling .",
    "the basis of our theoretical work@xcite has been a continuum model of the burton , cabrera , and frank@xcite type .",
    "this allows an analytic solution to be obtained and a linear stability analysis to be carried out , but can not address the variety of morphologies seen for fully developed step bunching , for which the solution of the two - dimensional problem is required .",
    "there are two approaches .",
    "one is to use a continuum formulation , for example , one based on the phase - field method.@xcite this has the advantage of building the extended terrace length scales on the substrate from the outset , but suffers from the difficulty of including the details of step kinetics while retaining a direct connection to the atomistic parameters .",
    "kinetic monte carlo ( kmc ) simulations provide an obvious alternative in that the atomistic processes can be included to whatever level of detail required , but the large terrace lengths present a computational challenge for traditional formulations .",
    "one alternative is to use a hybrid scheme that combines the flexibility of the kmc approach and the extended length and time scales of continuum methods.@xcite these methods are currently under investigation .",
