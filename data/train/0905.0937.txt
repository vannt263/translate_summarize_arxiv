    "spintronics continues to attract interest because of potential applications to information technology , but also because it has greatly improved our understanding of the role of different spin - dependent interaction mechanisms , i.e. of the spin - orbit coupling , for many - electron systems.@xcite several spintronic devices have been proposed that manipulate the carrier spin via spin - orbit coupling ( soc).@xcite in recent years , progress in nanofabrication and growth techniques has made it possible to produce high - quality quantum wires ( qwrs ) and investigate physics in these semiconductor nanostructures.@xcite the energy spectrum of qwr systems with strong soc has been studied experimentally@xcite and theoretically.@xcite for @xmath1-type qwrs , most of the works concentrate on the energy spectrum,@xcite but for @xmath0-type quantum structures , many investigations have been performed with the aim of understanding the electron spin relaxation.@xcite    for qwrs , the spin relaxation time ( srt ) was measured,@xcite and calculated in the framework of a single - particle model@xcite and monte - carlo simulations.@xcite recently , liu _ _ et al.__@xcite investigated the srt for qwrs in the ( 110 ) crystal direction , but systematic studies of spin relaxation in @xmath0-type qwrs are scarce . a general way to obtain the nonequilibrium spin dynamics and the spin relaxation time in semiconductors heterostructures has been developed by wu _",

    "this allows us to investigate qwrs with a wide range of sizes . especially for larger diameters of the wires , the spin precession and the spin relaxation are expected to show different characteristics from narrow ones , as electrons populate more than one subband and therefore experience different socs and undergo intra - subbband and inter - subband coulomb scattering .",

    "the weak scattering regime is reached where the anisotropy of the soc contributions becomes dominant .",
    "additional scattering leads to a more efficient dephasing , so that the srt increases when we switch off scattering contributions .",
    "we also plot the case of larger wire width with @xmath132  nm in fig .",
    "compared to the case of fig .",
    "5(a ) , the electrons are populating higher subbands , so that the dresselhaus term becomes more important .",
    "therefore , the band structure anisotropy will become important at smaller @xmath66 .",
    "5(b ) shows that the result of the full calculation intersects the one without the electron - electron scattering at @xmath133  @xmath69 . for this wire geometry",
    ", the result without the inter - subband electron - electron scattering also crosses the full calculation . to see in more detail how the strength of anisotropic soc contributions affects the spin relaxation",
    ", we also plot the result without the dresselhaus term .",
    "for this somewhat artificial case , the srt becomes much longer .",
    "this indicates that the contribution of the dresseslhaus term is very important for this wire width in contrast to the case of smaller wire width in fig .",
    "5(a ) , because the transverse component of the effective magnetic field contributed by the dresselhaus term is important only for the large wire width when higher subbands are populated .",
    "_ vs. _ the temperature for ( 100 ) qwrs at different wire sizes @xmath106 at carrier density @xmath68  @xmath69.,width=321 ]    finally we look at the temperature dependence of the srt at different wire widths in fig .  6 .",
    "we choose ( 100 ) qwrs at a representative electron density of @xmath111  @xmath69 .",
    "the temperature affects the srt in two ways : for the smaller wires @xmath134  nm the carriers are confined in the lowest subband without populating higher @xmath9-states where the anisotropic soc contributions to the bandstructure become much stronger . in this strong scattering regime , the behavior can qualitatively be explained by the motional narrowing : increasing temperature leads to enhanced scattering with phonons and electrons with higher kinetic energies , so that the effective carrier lifetime becomes shorter , and the srt increases .",
    "around @xmath135  nm and @xmath136  k this behavior crosses over to the weak scattering limit , in which higher subbands are populated , the precession frequencies around the effective internal fields become higher , and additional scattering leads to a more efficient dephasing , so that the srt decreases with @xmath137 .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the spin relaxation of electrons in @xmath0-type inas qwrs .",
    "the srt is calculated by numerically solving the microscopic ksbes including multiple subbands .",
    "the inclusion of higher subbands allows us to investigate qwrs larger qwrs than in ref .  , and we find that the quantum - wire size influences the spin relaxation time via the soc : the dresselhaus term contains a longitudinal contribution to the internal effective magnetic field , which can effectively reduce the spin precession , and thereby the spin relaxation .",
    "it also contains a transverse component , which provides a contribution to the spin precession involving different subbands and enhances spin relaxation . when the wire width is small and only the lowest subband in the qwr is important , the longitudinal term is dominant .",
    "when the wire width is large and higher subbands are populated , the transverse contribution dominates over the longitudinal one , and a faster spin relaxation results .",
    "we also studied different growth directions for qwrs .",
    "we show that one can obtain long spin relaxation time by optimizing the growth direction , quantum - wire width and the direction of the initial spin polariazation .",
    "further , we investigated how the details of the microscopic scattering mechanisms and the spin - orbit effects in the band structure affect the spin relaxation .",
    "the population of higher subbands was found to have decisive influence on the behavior of the srt .",
    "for instance , if the geometry and external conditions are such that higher subbands become populated , the dependence of the srt on temperature is reversed because the motional narrowing regime is left .",
