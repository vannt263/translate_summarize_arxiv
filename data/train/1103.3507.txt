    "under appropriate conditions , the resolvent of the laplacian on an asymptotically hyperbolic space continues analytically through the spectrum @xcite . in this paper",
    "we obtain estimates on the analytic continuation of the resolvent for the laplacian of a metric that is a small perturbation of the poincar metric on hyperbolic space . in particular",
    "we show for these perturbations of the metric , and allowing in addition a real - valued potential , that there are only a finite number of poles for the analytic continuation of the resolvent to any half - plane containing the physical region and that the resolvent satisfies polynomial bounds on appropriate weighted sobolev spaces near infinity in such a strip .",
    "this result , for a small strip , is then applied to the twisted laplacian which is the stationary part of the dalembertian on de sitter - schwarzschild . in a companion paper @xcite the decay of solutions to the wave equation on de sitter - schwarzschild space",
    "is analyzed using these estimates .    in the main part of this paper constructive semiclassical methods",
    "are used to analyze the resolvent of the laplacian , and potential perturbations of it , for a complete , asymptotically hyperbolic , metric on the interior of the ball , @xmath0 @xmath1 here @xmath2 is the standard hyperbolic metric , @xmath3 is a symmetric 2-tensor which is smooth up to the boundary of the ball and @xmath4 has @xmath5 if @xmath6 @xmath7 if @xmath8 the perturbation here is always the same at the boundary but is cut off closer and closer to it as @xmath9 for @xmath10 small enough we show that the analytic continuation of the resolvent of the laplacian is smooth , so has no poles , in the intersection of the exterior of a sufficiently large ball with any strip around the real axis in the non - physical half - space as an operator between weighted @xmath11 or sobolev spaces , and obtain high - energy estimates for this resolvent in this strip .",
    "a special case of these estimates is as follows : let @xmath12 @xmath13 be real - valued and let @xmath14 denote the resolvent of @xmath15 the spectral theorem shows that @xmath16 is well defined as a bounded operator in @xmath17 if @xmath18 and the results of mazzeo and the first author show that it continues meromorphically to the upper half plane . here",
    "we show that there exists a strip about the real axis such that if @xmath19 is small and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are suitably chosen @xmath22 has no poles , provided @xmath23 is large , and moreover we obtain a polynomial bound for the norm of @xmath24 more precisely , with @xmath25 the @xmath11-based sobolev space of order @xmath26 , so for @xmath27 , @xmath28    ( see theorem  [ resolvent - bounds ] for the full statement . ) [ resolvent - bounds - simple ] there exist @xmath29 such that if @xmath30 then @xmath31 continues holomorphically to the region @xmath32",
    "@xmath33 @xmath34 provided @xmath35 and @xmath36 moreover , there exists @xmath37 such that @xmath38    this estimate is not optimal ; the optimal bound is expected to be @xmath39 results from ignoring the oscillatory behavior of the schwartz kernel of the resolvent ; a stationary phase type argument ( which is made delicate by the intersecting lagrangians described later ) should give an improved result .",
    "however , for our application , which we now describe , the polynomial loss suffices , as there are similar losses from the trapped geodesics in compact sets .",
    "as noted above , these results and the underlying estimates can be applied to study the wave equation on @xmath40 dimensional de sitter - schwarzschild space .",
    "this model is given by @xmath41_r\\times{\\mathbb{s}}^{n}_\\omega , \\label{model - ndim}\\ ] ] with the lorentzian metric @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the standard metric on @xmath44 @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 positive constants satisfying @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the two positive roots of @xmath50    the dalembertian associated to the metric @xmath51 is @xmath52 an important goal is then to give a precise description of the asymptotic behavior , in all regions , of space - time , of the solution of the wave equation , @xmath53 , with initial data which are is necessarily compactly supported .",
    "the results given below can be used to attain this goal ; see the companion paper @xcite .    since we are only interested here in the null space of the dalembertian , the leading factor of @xmath54 can be dropped .",
    "the results above can be applied to the corresponding stationary operator , which is a twisted laplacian @xmath55 in what follows we will sometimes consider @xmath56 as a boundary defining function of @xmath57 this amounts to a change in the @xmath58 structure of @xmath59 we denote the new manifold by @xmath60    the second order elliptic operator @xmath61 in is self - adjoint , and non - negative , with respect to the measure @xmath62 with @xmath56 given by .",
    "so , by the spectral theorem , the resolvent @xmath63 is holomorphic for @xmath64 in @xcite the second author and zworski , using methods of mazzeo and the first author from @xcite , sjstrand and zworski @xcite and zworski @xcite prove that the resolvent family has an analytic continuation .",
    "( s barreto - zworski , see @xcite)[mercont ] as operators @xmath65 the family has a meromorphic continuation to @xmath66 with isolated poles of finite rank .",
    "moreover , there exists @xmath67 such that the only pole of @xmath68 with @xmath69 is at @xmath70 it has multiplicity one .",
    "theorem [ mercont ] was proved for @xmath71 but its proof easily extends to higher dimensions .    in order to describe the asymptotics of wave propagation precisely on @xmath72 via @xmath68",
    "it is necessary to understand the action of @xmath68 on weighted sobolev spaces for @xmath73 in a strip about the real axis as @xmath74 .",
    "the results of @xcite actually show that @xmath68 is bounded as a map between the weighted spaces in question ; the issue is uniform control of the norm at high energies .",
    "the strategy is to obtain bounds for @xmath68 for @xmath75 large in the interior of @xmath76 then near the ends @xmath77 and @xmath78 and later glue those estimates . in the case",

    "the advantage of the method of @xcite is that one does not need to obtain a bound for the exact resolvent in the interior and we may work with the approximate model of @xcite instead .",

    "let @xmath91 be another riemannian manifold extending @xmath92 ( and thus @xmath93 ) and which is euclidean outside some compact set , and let @xmath94 be a self - adjoint operator extending @xmath61 with principal symbol given by the metric on @xmath95 which is equal to the euclidean laplacian on the ends .",

    "this result can be refined by allowing the power of the weight , on either side , to approach @xmath122 at the expense of an additional logarithmic term , see theorem  [ globalest - strong ] .",
    "two proofs of theorem [ globalest ] are given below .",
    "the first , which is somewhat simpler but valid only for @xmath71 is given in sections [ sec : decomposition ] and [ sec : black - hole - proof ] .",
    "it uses techniques of bruneau and petkov @xcite to glue the resolvent estimates from theorem  [ resolvent - bounds - simple ] and the localized estimate .",
    "the second proof , valid in general dimension , uses the estimate and the semiclassical resolvent gluing techniques of datchev and the third author @xcite .",
    "this is carried out in section [ sec : black - hole - n+1-proof ] .",
    "related weighted @xmath11 estimates for the resolvent on asymptotically hyperbolic and asymptotically euclidean spaces have been proved by cardoso and vodev in @xcite",
    ". however , such estimates , combined with theorem [ bhthm ] , only give the holomorphic continuation of the resolvent , as an operator acting on weighted @xmath11 spaces , for @xmath81 to a region below a curve which converges polynomially to the real axis .",
    "these weaker estimates do suffice to establish the asymptotic behavior of solutions of the wave equation modulo rapidly decaying terms ( rather than exponentially decaying ) and would give a different proof of the result of dafermos and rodnianski @xcite .    in the case of a non - trapping asymptotically hyperbolic manifold which has constant sectional curvature near the boundary ,",
    "it was shown by guillarmou in @xcite that there exists a strip about the real axis , excluding a neighborhood of the origin , which is free of resonances . in the case",
    "studied here , the sectional curvature of the metric associated to @xmath61 is not constant near the boundary , and there exist trapped trajectories .",
    "however , see @xcite , all trapped trajectories of the hamilton flow of @xmath61 are hyperbolic , and the projection of the trapped set onto the base space is contained in the sphere @xmath123 which is known as the ergo - sphere . since the effects of the trapped trajectories are included in the estimates of bony and hfner , constructing the analytic continuation of the resolvent of a twisted laplacian that has the correct asymptotic behavior at infinity , uniformly at high energies , allows one to obtain the desired estimates on weighted sobolev spaces via pasting techniques introduced by bruneau and petkov @xcite .",
    "the main technical result is thus theorem  [ resolvent - bounds - simple ] , and its strengthening , theorem  [ resolvent - bounds ] .",
    "theorem  [ resolvent - bounds ] is proved by the construction of a high - energy parametrix for @xmath124 .",
    "more precisely , as customary , the problem is translated to the construction of a semiclassical parametrix for @xmath125 where now @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 , @xmath129 , so the actual spectral parameter is @xmath130 and @xmath131 is bounded .",
    "note that for @xmath132 , @xmath133 is meromorphic by the results of mazzeo and the first author @xcite .",
    "moreover , while @xmath73 is not real , its imaginary part is @xmath134 in the semiclassical sense , and is thus not part of the semiclassical principal symbol of the operator .",
    "the construction proceeds on the semiclassical resolution @xmath135 of the product of the double space @xmath136 introduced in @xcite , and the interval @xmath137  this space is described in detail in section  [ semiclassical - double - space ] .",
    "recall that , for fixed @xmath138 , the results of @xcite show that the schwartz kernel of @xmath139 , defined for @xmath132 , is well - behaved ( polyhomogeneous conormal ) on @xmath136 , and it extends meromorphically across @xmath140 with a similarly polyhomogeneous conormal schwartz kernel .",
    "thus , the space we are considering is a very natural one .",
    "the semiclassical resolution is already needed away from all boundaries ; it consists of blowing up the diagonal at @xmath141 .",
    "note that @xmath142 is a semiclassical differential operator which is elliptic in the usual sense , but its semiclassical principal symbol @xmath143 is not elliptic ( here @xmath144 is the dual metric function ) . ignoring the boundaries for a moment , when a semiclassical differential operator is elliptic in both senses , it has a parametrix in the small semiclassical calculus , i.e.  one which vanishes to infinite order at @xmath141 off the semiclassical front face ( i.e.  away from the diagonal in @xmath145 ) .",
    "however , as @xmath142 is not elliptic semiclassically , semiclassical singularities ( lack of decay as @xmath129 ) flow out of the semiclassical front face .",
    "it is useful to consider the flow in terms of lagrangian geometry .",
    "thus , the small calculus of order @xmath146 semiclassical pseudodifferential operators consists of operators whose schwartz kernels are semiclassical - conormal to the diagonal at @xmath141 . as @xmath142 is not semiclassically elliptic ( but is elliptic in the usual sense",
    ", so it behaves as a semiclassical pseudodifferential operator of order @xmath146 for our purposes ) , in order to construct a parametrix for @xmath142 , we need to follow the flow out of semiclassical singularities from the conormal bundle of the diagonal . for @xmath142 as above , the resulting lagrangian manifold is induced by the geodesic flow , and is in particular , up to a constant factor , the graph of the differential of the distance function on the product space .",
    "thus , it is necessary to analyze the geodesic flow and the distance function ; here the presence of boundaries is the main issue . as we show in section  [ distance - function ] , the geodesic flow is well - behaved on @xmath136 as a lagrangian manifold of the appropriate cotangent bundle .",
    "further , for @xmath147 small ( this is where the smallness of the metric perturbation enters ) , its projection to the base is a diffeomorphism , which implies that the distance function is also well - behaved .",
    "this last step is based upon the precise description of the geodesic flow and the distance function on hyperbolic space , see section  [ distance - function ] .    in section  [ full - sc - parametrix ]",
    ", we then construct the parametrix by first solving away the diagonal singularity ; this is the usual elliptic parametrix construction .",
    "next , we solve away the small calculus error in taylor series at the semiclassical front face , and then propagate the solution along the flow - out by solving transport equations .",
    "this is an analogue of the intersecting lagrangian construction of the first author and uhlmann @xcite , see also the work of hassell and wunsch @xcite in the semiclassical setting .",
    "so far in this discussion the boundaries of @xmath148 arising from the boundaries of @xmath136 have been ignored ; these enter into the steps so far only in that it is necessary to ensure that the construction is uniform ( in a strong , smooth , sense ) up to these boundaries , which the semiclassical front face as well as the lift of @xmath149 meet transversally , and only in the zero front face , i.e.  at the front face of the blow - up of @xmath150 that created @xmath136 .",
    "next we need to analyze the asymptotics of the solutions of the transport equations at the left and right boundary faces of @xmath136 ; this is facilitated by our analysis of the flowout lagrangian ( up to these boundary faces ) . at this point",
    "we obtain a parametrix whose error is smoothing and is @xmath151 , but does not , as yet , have any decay at the zero front face .",
    "the last step , which is completely analogous to the construction of mazzeo and the first author , removes this error .    as a warm - up to this analysis , in section  [ 3d - parametrix ]",
    "we present a three dimensional version of this construction , with worse , but still sufficiently well - behaved error terms .",
    "this is made possible by a coincidence , namely that in @xmath152 the schwartz kernel of the resolvent of the laplacian at energy @xmath153 is a constant multiple of @xmath154 , and @xmath155 is a homogeneous function on @xmath152 , which enables one to blow - down the semiclassical front face at least to leading order .",
    "thus , the first steps of the construction are simplified , though the really interesting parts , concerning the asymptotic behavior at the left and right boundaries along the lagrangian , are unchanged .",
    "we encourage the reader to read this section first as it is more explicit and accessible than the treatment of arbitrary dimensions .    in section  [ sec :",
    "l2-bounds ] , we obtain weighted @xmath11-bounds for the parametrix and its error . in section  [ sec : resolvent - bounds ] we used these to prove theorem  [ resolvent - bounds - simple ] and theorem  [ resolvent - bounds ] .    in section  [ sec : black - hole ]",
    "we describe in detail the de sitter - schwarzschild set - up",
    ". then in section  [ sec : decomposition ] , in dimension @xmath156 , we describe the approach of bruneau and petkov @xcite reducing the necessary problem to the combination of analysis on the ends , i.e.  theorem  [ resolvent - bounds ] , and of the cutoff resolvent , i.e.  theorem  [ bhthm ] .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : black - hole - proof ] , we use this method to prove theorem  [ globalest ] , and its strengthening , theorem  [ globalest - strong ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : black - hole - n+1-proof ] we give a different proof which works in general dimension , and does not require knowledge of estimates for the exact cutoff resolvent .",
    "instead , it uses the results of wunsch and zworski @xcite for normally hyperbolic trapping in the presence of euclidean ends and of datchev and the third author @xcite which provide a method to combine these with our estimates on hyperbolic ends . since",
    "this method is described in detail in @xcite , we keep this section fairly brief .",
    "in this section we state the full version of the main technical result , theorem  [ resolvent - bounds - simple ] .",

    "in the construction of the uniform parametrix for the resolvent we will make use of an appropriate resolution of the distance function , and geodesic flow , for the metric @xmath193 this in turn is obtained by perturbation from @xmath194 so we start with an analysis of the hyperbolic distance , for which there is an explicit formula .",
    "namely , the distance function for the hyperbolic metric , @xmath195 is given in terms of the euclidean metric on the ball by @xmath196    we are particularly interested in a uniform description as one or both of the points approach the boundary , i.e.  infinity .",
    "the boundary behavior is resolved by lifting to the ` zero stretched product ' as is implicit in @xcite .",

    "indeed this is certainly true away from the front face produced by the blow up .",

    "the presence of only simple logarithmic singularities in shows , perhaps somewhat counter - intuitively , that the lagrangian submanifold which is the graph of the differential of the distance should be smooth ( away from the diagonal ) in the b - cotangent bundle of @xmath237 conversely if this is shown for the perturbed metric then the analogue of follows except for the possibility of a logarithmic term at the front face .",

    "smoothness of the hamilton vector field together with transversality conditions shows that the flow - out of the conormal bundle of the diagonal is a smooth lagrangian submanifold of the cotangent bundle under consideration ; closeness to a particular lagrangian ( such as that for hyperbolic space ) restricted to which projection to @xmath311 is a diffeomorphism , guarantees that this lagrangian is also a graph over @xmath237 thus , over the interior , @xmath312 , it is the graph of the differential of the distance function , and the latter is smooth ; the same would hold globally if the lagrangian were smooth on @xmath313 the latter can not happen , though the lagrangian will be a graph in the b- , and indeed the partial b- , cotangent bundles over @xmath237 these give regularity of the distance function , namely smoothness up to the front face ( directly for the partial b bundle , with a short argument if using the b bundle ) , and the logarithmic behavior up to the other faces .",
    "note that had we only showed the graph statement in the pullback of @xmath314 one would obtain directly only a weaker regularity statement for the distance function ; roughly speaking , the closer the bundle in which the lagrangian is described is to the standard cotangent bundle , the more regularity the distance function has .",

    "indeed , the first step in the construction of @xmath51 is to construct a piece of @xmath634 , namely to find @xmath637 such that @xmath638 has no singularity at the lifted diagonal , @xmath497 with @xmath639 ( hence @xmath640 ) supported in a neighborhood of @xmath631 in @xmath148 that only intersects the boundary of @xmath148 at @xmath507 and @xmath635 .",
