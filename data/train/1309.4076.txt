    "in recent years , ultra - cold atoms in optical lattices have provided a way to experimentally realize tight - binding models for bosons or fermions .",
    "tight - binding models , where particles are assumed to be well - described in terms of strongly localized atomic orbitals , are widely used in condensed matter physics , as they allow to study the electronic states in many types of structures , and help to gain a qualitative understanding of electronic band structure , predict phase transitions , investigate magnetism , etc . unlike most solid state materials , cold atom systems can be devised for which the tight - binding model holds to a good approximation @xcite , and for which the parameters of the models can be tuned .",
    "we will describe in this paper how one can use the optical potential due to four standing wave laser fields to realize a two dimensional quasiperiodic cold atom quasicrystal having an eight - fold symmetry which is closely related to the well - known octagonal or ammann - beenker tiling @xcite . we describe the structure and its properties , and the effective tight - binding model to describe fermions or bosons trapped in this optical quasicrystal .",
    "this type of system , if realized experimentally , should provide valuable insights into the quantum properties of quasicrystals",
    ". an interesting experiment would be to study the quantum dynamics of wave packets prepared at a given energy , as calculations in a number of quasiperiodic models show the possibility of anomalous ( super)diffusion with exponents which depend on the initial position of the wave packet .",
    "we consider atoms trapped in a region where standing waves have been set up using four laser beams oriented at 45@xmath0 angles in the @xmath1 plane and with polarizations perpendicular to this plane . for the case of four standing waves , assuming they are all of equal amplitude , with different phase shifts @xmath2 ,",
    "the intensity is given by @xmath3 ^ 2 $ ] , [ ixy.eq ] where @xmath4 and the four wave vectors are @xmath5 with @xmath6 .",
    "the dipole potential seen by an atom , @xmath7 , derives from the ac stark shift of the atomic levels . in the limit of large detuning @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 is the laser frequency and @xmath10 is the atomic resonance frequency ) the potential",
    "is given by @xmath11 ^ 2   \\label{vxy.eq}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 , when the excited state width @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the potential is thus proportional to the local intensity , and can be positive or negative depending on the sign of @xmath14 .",
    "the optical potential corresponding to eq.[vxy.eq ] is an instance of a quasiperiodic function , the theory of which goes back to h. bohr @xcite and a. besicovitch @xcite .",
    "quasiperiodic potentials have been proposed before in the literature .",
    "a one dimensional bichromatic lattice was investigated by deissler et al @xcite , for interacting bosonic atoms .",
    "quasiperiodic potentials in the plane were realized in @xcite , to study effects of quasiperiodicity in cold atom gases and , incidentally , also in colloidal systems as in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we provide the first explicit description of a quasiperiodic structure obtained using an optical potential , which we call an optical quasicrystal ( oq ) .",
    "this structure , in which atoms are separated by edges of a fixed length , is closely related to the standard octagonal tiling ( ot ) and its structure factor has an infinite set of bragg peaks , as expected for a quasicrystal .",
    "eq.[vxy.eq ] describes a complex intensity landscape of saddlepoints and local maxima of intensities @xmath15 .",
    "this choice of out - of - plane beam polarization implies a large intensity contrast between the maxima and minima , whereas taking in - plane polarizations would give a smaller contrast ( @xmath16 ) and therefore less well localized atoms .",
    "we now consider cold atoms confined to the @xmath1 plane via a harmonic trap in the @xmath17 direction , and subjected to this potential . in the limit of a potential with strong variations",
    ", the atoms will be localized at certain sites providing the temperature is sufficiently low . in the case of a red - detuned lattice , @xmath18 , these sites correspond to the local maxima of @xmath19 . depending on the temperature and on the number of available atoms ( the  filling \" of the optical lattice ) the occupied sites",
    "are thus those local maxima for which @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a cut - off . as the value of cut - off approaches the maximum value @xmath22 , only the largest peaks ( corresponding to the lowest energy states )",
    "are occupied , and the density of sites decreases .",

    "we will show that the four edge - vectors , @xmath23 , as illustrated in fig.1a can be expressed in terms of the laser wavelength @xmath24 and the irrational number , @xmath25 , sometimes called the silver mean .",
    "figs.[one.fig ] show that the patterns appearing in the optical system are very similar to those found in the standard octagonal tiling @xcite , composed of squares and 45@xmath0 rhombuses .",
    "patterns in the ot repeat quasiperiodically in space , and occur in eight equiprobable orientations .",
    "its fourier transform ( structure factor ) has perfect eight - fold symmetry , and comprises a dense set of dirac delta functions of different intensities , most of which are vanishingly small .",
