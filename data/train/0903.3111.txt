    "the motivation for our study is to understand better the nature of the anisotropy in electrical conductivity of percolating systems .",
    "this is approached by means of the random resistor network model ( rrn ) @xcite .",
    "to our knowledge the first analytic solution for conductivity of anisotropic rrn on the regular square ( 2d ) and cubic ( 3d ) lattice was obtained by bernaskoni @xcite .",
    "another useful result is that the resistor networks can be associated with the networks of saddle points in the conductivity profile of high - contrast systems as proved in @xcite .",
    "currently , anisotropic rrn models are studied in geophysics , which could possibly help in prediction of earthquakes @xcite . besides conductivity , rrn has been used to predict magnetic properties of materials @xcite and even to estimate sample destruction under critical mechanical stress @xcite .",
    "the latter research provides a possible link to the science of earthquakes too @xcite .",
    "present study is based on rrn model and uses the exact solution on the isotropic bethe lattice obtained by stinchcombe @xcite .",
    "this solution was demonstrated to describe the macroscopic conductivity curve for rrn on the regular 3d lattice calculated with a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation @xcite .",
    "in addition , this solution can be used in connection with several important problems in solid - state physics @xcite .",
    "we provide a generalization of the stinchcombe s calculation to the case of a binary bethe lattice , see fig [ figbethelettice ] .",
    "besides absence of closed loops , this structure has a special feature of being anisotropic at each node .",
    "specifically , there are @xmath0 bonds of @xmath1 kind and @xmath2 bonds of @xmath3 kind connected at each branching point . at the same time , their total sum at a node is equal to a constant number @xmath4 refereed to as the coordination number of the lattice .",
    "we would like to make a distinction between the finite bethe lattice known also as the caley tree and the infinite lattice with the surface sites neglected .",

    "unlike several previous anisotropic percolation theories @xcite based on the model of different probabilities of filling for two types of lattice bonds , we consider the distribution of resistors isotropic",

    "the question how to perform configurational averages turns out a difficult one .",

    "indeed , the isotropic percolation probability @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the probability to have the finite cluster @xcite , can be generalized to the anisotropic one , @xmath38 , which gives @xmath39 if @xmath40 .",

    "the discrepancy of the critical exponent of 2 with the value of 3 in the case of infinite dimensions examined by de gennes @xcite , we assign to the category of unresolved problems especially because de gennes uses the concept of surface that is never considered in bethe lattice theories .",
    "it is known also that the critical exponents @xmath54 and @xmath55 in the classical flory - stockmayer theory of the sol - gel transition formulated on bethe lattice are close to those at 3 dimensions @xcite . in the conductivity field ,",
