    "surface growing @xcite is a phenomenon observed in nature as well as in the laboratory . as an example of the latter we cite the experimental technique known as molecular beam epitaxy which allows us the growing of surface at the atomic level .",
    "the surface is described by a height variable @xmath0 that gives the height of the deposited layer at a given point @xmath1 of the substrate at time @xmath2 .",
    "several models have been introduced to describe the mean features of surface growing in which the heights are stochastic variables whose time evolution is governed by a markovian stochastic process .",
    "here we are concerned with the solution of such models by the use of mean - field approximations .",
    "two relevant quantities are used to characterize the surface growth .",
    "one is the mean height @xmath3 of the surface from the substrate and the other is the surface width @xmath4 , which is a measure of the surface roughness .",
    "the divergence of @xmath4 characterizes a rough interface . according to family and vicsek @xcite",
    ", the width of a rough surface of a sufficient large system behaves as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the growth exponent .",
    "this behavior characterizes a rough thermodynamic phase .",
    "otherwise , that is , if the width of an infinite system remains finite when @xmath7 , the surface is smooth .",
    "a roughening transition takes place when , by varying the control parameters , the surface changes from a smooth to a rough surface .",
    "the interface may yet be pinned or moving .",
    "a moving thermodynamic phase is characterized by a constant velocity @xmath8 of the interface , or in other words , by a linear growth of the mean height , that is , @xmath9 a depinning transition @xcite from a pinned to a moving phase occurs when , by changing the control parameters , the interface begins to move with a constant velocity .",
    "this is also known as a wetting transition @xcite since in the moving phase the mean height becomes infinitely large when @xmath7 , that characterizes a wet phase . at the depinning transition",
    ", the mean height may not grow linearly with time but may behave according to @xmath10 in the model we study here the depinning transition coincide with the roughening transition .",
    "if we define @xmath11 as the one - point height probability distribution at time @xmath2 , the mean height @xmath3 and the square @xmath12 of the surface width are the first moment and the variance of this probability distribution , respectively .",
    "the asymptotic behavior given by eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) can then be obtained from the following scaling form @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a universal function .",
    "the behaviors given by eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) also follows from this same form by setting @xmath15 .",
    "some models have been introduced to describe the surface growth and the asymptotic behavior in which the heights are stochastic variables governed by langevin equations .",
    "two important ones are the edwards - wilkinson ( ew ) @xcite @xmath16 and the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a white noise . since the ew equation is linear , it stays invariant under the transformation @xmath19 while the kpz equation , which is nonlinear , lacks this property . in one dimension",
    "the growth exponent for the ew class is @xmath20 and for the kpz class is @xmath21 .    in this work",
    "we study a growth model , introduced by hinrichsen et al .",
    "@xcite , with deposition and evaporation of particles that respects the restricted solid on solid ( rsos ) condition @xcite and in which the evaporation at the initial height is forbidden , that is , there is a wall at the zero height .",
    "the presence of the wall leads to a nonequilibrium wetting transition depending on the evaporation and deposition rates .",
    "it is worth mentioning that nonequilibrium wetting transition has been already studied by another approach namely by mapping the kpz with a potential into a langevin equation with a multiplicative noise @xcite .",
    "the growth model is studied here by means of simple and pair mean - field approximations .",
    "the mean - field approximation at the pair level , which does respect the rsos condition exactly , is found to be capable of describing a moving phase , that is , a moving interface at constant velocity",
    ". another feature of the two - site mean - field approximation is that it becomes the exact solution when detailed balance is fulfilled .",
    "recently , a mean - field theory for surface growth has been introduced by hinrichsen et al .",
    "@xcite and used by ginelli and hinrichsen @xcite to study a single step model for surface growth .",
    "the one - site and two - site mean - field approximations we use here are distinct from that of hinrichsen et al . @xcite but share properties that are similar .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we define the model to be examined and write down the master equation for general models with the rsos condition . in section iii",
    "we solve the master equation within the one - site mean - field approach exactly .",
    "the section iv is dedicated to the pair mean - field approach .",
    "the resultant equations are solved numerically and compared with the results obtained from the one - site approximation and from simulations . in section v we analyze the detailed balance condition and in section vi we present our conclusions .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional lattice where a discrete variable @xmath22 is attached to the site @xmath23 , that represents the height of the pile of particles at site @xmath23 .",
    "the stochastic variable @xmath22 takes the integer values . at time",
    "@xmath24 we consider a flat surface at the zero level , that is , @xmath25 for all @xmath23 .",
    "we consider models with random sequential updates of the heights , that have not only deposition but also evaporation .",
    "we will restrict ourselves only to models that obey the rsos condition , that is , such that @xmath26 ( see fig .",
    "[ rsos ] ) . at each time step",
    "only one site is updated according to local stochastic rules .",
    "if site @xmath23 is chosen , these rules will affect only the neighboring sites @xmath27 and @xmath28 and site @xmath23 itself .",
    "the rate of the transition @xmath29 is denoted by @xmath30 .",
    "the only possible transitions are those for which @xmath31 meaning that the height is increased ( deposition ) or decreased ( evaporation ) by just one unit .",
    "the possible transition rates are presented in fig .",
    "[ rate ] and are given by @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 and the model so defined has six parameters : @xmath38 . by rescaling time",
    "we see that they are not all independent and one of them can set equal to unity .",
    "the probability @xmath39 of a given configuration @xmath40 at time @xmath2 obeys the master equation @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 and we are considering periodic boundary conditions . for late use",
    "we write down the time evolution of the marginal probability distribution related to a given site , say site @xmath44 .",
    "it is given by @xmath45 @xmath46 we also write down the time evolution of the marginal probability distribution related to two consecutive sites , say site 1 and 2 .",
    "it is given by @xmath47 @xmath48 valid for solutions that are translationally invariant , where we have made use of the symmetry @xmath49 .",
    "for certain values of the parameters the stochastic process exhibits detailed balance .",
    "this means to say that each term of the summation on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) vanishes in the time independent stationary state . in this case",
    "the time independent stationary probability distribution can be written as the product @xmath50 where @xmath51 are the elements of a symmetric matrix @xmath52 , that vanish whenever the rsos condition is not fulfilled .",
    "the detailed balance condition gives the following relations for the nonvanishing elements of @xmath52 , denoted by @xmath53 and @xmath54 , @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 from these equations follows the relation @xcite @xmath58 which is the condition for detailed balance to hold .    in the specific model @xcite",
    "we study here , the deposition occurs with a rate @xmath59 and the evaporation , for nonzero heights , occurs with rates @xmath60 or @xmath61 , depending on the neighbors configuration . more specifically , if @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 ; and if @xmath65 , @xmath66 the detailed balance condition ( [ db ] ) gives @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , when @xmath67 is respected the model can be solved exactly @xcite for the pinned phase .    without the wall at the initial height , we would have a rough interface growing in the positive direction for @xmath68 and in the negative direction for @xmath69 . with the wall the phase @xmath68 is not affected , in the the sense that the interface still grows and is rough . for @xmath69 , in the presence of the wall ,",
    "the interface is smooth and stays pinned to the substrate .",
    "hence , at @xmath70 , the model displays a depinning and a roughening transition .",
    "the rough interface may display a ew or a kpz behavior . in the case",
    "@xmath67 , it is known that the crossover from ew to kpz behavior @xcite coincides with the critical point occurring at @xmath71 .",
    "the case @xmath72 @xcite is special since in this case no particle can be evaporated from a completed filled layer and the presence of the wall thus makes no difference . the critical behavior at @xmath72 places the model in the universality class of the directed percolation ( dp ) class @xcite .",
    "the order parameter of the pinned phase is the density of sites , @xmath73 , in contact with the substrate , or the wall .",
    "it is assumed to behave near and below the transition as @xmath74 the interface width @xmath4 is finite at the pinned phase but diverges as one approaches the critical point .",
    "we assume that it diverges according to @xmath75 the order parameter of the moving phase is chosen to be the velocity @xmath8 of the interface growing , defined by @xmath76 which can also be written as @xmath77 near and above the transition we assume that the velocity behaves as @xmath78",
    "we are interested in studying the solution of the master equation associated to an infinite system . in order to solve the master equation ( [ master ] ) we begin by using a simple mean field approximation . in this approach",
    "all the correlations are neglected resulting into the following approximation : @xmath79 .",
    "insertion of this approximation into equation ( [ one ] ) yields a closed equation for the one - site probability @xmath80 distribution @xmath81 @xmath82 valid for the specific model defined by the rates ( [ sm ] ) , where we are using the integer variable @xmath83 in the place of the height @xmath84 and initially @xmath85 and @xmath86 for @xmath87 because we are considering a initial flat surface .",
    "the variable @xmath88 when @xmath89 and @xmath90 otherwise .",
    "the equation is valid for @xmath91 and for @xmath89 provided we set @xmath92 on the right - hand side .",
    "let us first look for a possible stationary state , that is , a time - independent solution , that correspond to a pinned phase .",
    "if we assume a solution of the form @xmath93 we can check easily by substitution that this is indeed a solution provided @xmath94 is the root of the third - order algebraic equation @xmath95 the critical line , shown in fig .",
    "[ phase ] , is found by letting @xmath96 with the result @xmath97 and the stationary solution occurs for @xmath69 .",
    "the normalization of @xmath98 , given by ( [ sol ] ) , gives @xmath99 so that @xmath100 .",
    "the mean height @xmath3 and the square of the interface width @xmath12 are determined as the average and the variance of the distribution given by ( [ sol ] ) , that is @xmath101 resulting in @xmath102 and @xmath103 . near the critical line ,",
    "@xmath94 approaches 1 as @xmath104 from which follows the results @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "we solve the equation for @xmath108 by a method similar to that of ginelli and hinrichsen @xcite in which a continuous version of the equation is used .",

    "a consistency is achieved only if we choose the growth exponent as being @xmath115 . along the critical line ,",
    "the simple mean - field approximation is then compatible with an ew behavior .",

    "this equation can be solved by assuming again a scaling relation of the form ( [ scal ] ) .",
    "now , however , the consistency requires an exponent @xmath21 so that the simple mean - field approximation is then compatible with a kpz behavior .",

    "this maximum value of @xmath84 is determined by the normalization of @xmath11 and is given by @xmath125 .",
    "this allows us to determine @xmath126 and @xmath127 so that @xmath128    within the simple mean - field approximation we were able to observe a roughening transition occurring at the transition line shown in fig .",

    "as we have seen , the pair mean - field approximation takes into account the correlation of two consecutive sites which results in the exact satisfaction of the rsos condition in opposition to the simple mean - field approximation . because of that the pair mean - field results are closer to the simulation ones when compared to the simple mean - field results . for instance",

    "this last feature indicates that the pair mean - field is a good approximation for the nonequilibrium case ( @xmath181 ) , where exact results are generally not known .",
