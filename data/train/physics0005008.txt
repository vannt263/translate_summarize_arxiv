    "self - consistent example parameter sets for the acceleration and collider ring parameters of many - tev muon colliders were an important focal point for the discussions at the hemc99 workshop ",
    "`` studies on colliders and collider physics at the highest energies : muon colliders at 10 tev to 100 tev '' , held at montauk , ny from september 27-october 1 , 1999 .",
    "they served as straw - man examples to be criticized , fleshed - out and improved upon by the accelerator experts attending the workshop , and the physics - related parameters helped the experimental and theoretical physicists at the workshop in their evaluations and comments on the physics potential of such colliders .",
    "three acceleration and collider parameter sets were used at hemc99 : one at a center - of - mass energy of 10 tev ( set a ) and two at 100 tev ( sets b and c ) . the collider ring and accelerator parameters are presented in tables  [ colliderpara ] and  [ accel ] , respectively . for comparison ,",
    "table  [ colliderpara ] also includes the parameter ranges for the lower energy muon colliders that have been studied by the muon collider collaboration ( mcc ) .",
    "this paper describes the methods used to generate the parameter sets , details the motivations and assumptions for the specific choices of parameters and summarizes the evaluations , conclusions and suggestions for the parameter sets that were given by the workshop participants .    in more detail ,",
    "the collider ring parameters are presented first , in section  [ sec : collider ] , since they were considered the more critical of the two for assessing the feasibility of many - tev muon colliders .",
    "they also determine the initial assumptions used for the acceleration parameters , which are then discussed in section  [ sec : accel ] .",
    "the level of understanding advanced substantially during the workshop , and section  [ sec : assess ] goes over the issues and viewpoints raised during the workshop as well as referencing the more detailed studies that are included elsewhere in these proceedings and discussing their impact on our assessment of the parameter sets .",
    "finally , the outlook and conclusions section , section  [ sec : concl ] , summarizes the results discussed in the preceding section in the more general context of what they imply for the feasibility of many - tev muon colliders .",
    "this concluding section also discusses the outlook for iterations and refinements on the parameter sets and , more generally , previews some plans for further studies on many - tev muon colliders .",
    "self - consistent collider ring parameter sets for many - tev muon colliders .",
    "the parameters are as evaluated in the hemc99 workshop with the exception of the neutrino radiation parameters , which have been updated to incorporate the improved estimates from reference  @xcite . [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ assess ]    this section reviews the studies and assessments at hemc99 of the collider ring and acceleration parameter sets of tables  [ colliderpara ] and  [ accel ] .",
    "it will concentrate on the muon collider design issues arising out of the parameter sets .",
    "the reader is also referred to the summary paper by willis  @xcite for a more general overview of the findings of the workshop .",
    "table  [ assess ] summarizes the status of the acceleration and collider parameter sets after review at the workshop . as an important piece of contextual information",
    ", the assessment of parameter set a ( 10 tev ) , assumes that a tev - scale muon collider has already been built and successfully operated and the parameter set in each successive column assumes that the collider of the preceding column has already been built .",
    "the following subsections have been grouped according to subject areas that follow fairly closely , but not exactly , the rows of table  [ assess ] : on luminosity , acceleration , detectors , cooling , synchrotron radiation , final focus design and beam instabilities .",
    "a more general outlook and list of conclusions based on these observations will be deferred to the final section , section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "the luminosity requirements for @xmath0 colliders are discussed in some detail elsewhere in these proceedings  @xcite .",
    "ideally , collider luminosities should rise as @xmath1 and it is seen that , indeed , the luminosities for all three parameter sets in table  [ colliderpara ] are higher than for any existing or ( to the author s knowledge ) other proposed collider .",
    "both parameter sets a and c have excellent luminosities , even considering their high energies , while the luminosity of parameter set b was still considered to be `` fair '' for a 100 tev lepton collider .",
    "( see reference  @xcite for further discussion . )",
    "studies at hemc99 focused more on the collider ring parameter sets of table  [ colliderpara ] than on the acceleration scenario of table  [ accel ] .",
    "the acceleration scenario was considered critical mostly to the extent that it would be expected to be the biggest single component of the overall cost of the collider .",
    "unfortunately , the cost of the ffag magnets was not able to be explicitly addressed in any detail due to the newness and developing nature of ffag scenarios  @xcite for muon colliders . a rather indirect source for some optimism on the acceleration costs could come from any assumed correlation with some relatively favorable cost estimates for the collider ring magnets , by harrison  @xcite , who roughly assessed the cost for the collider magnets for the 10 tev scenario ( set a ) to be perhaps of order 400 million dollars .",
    "technically , muon acceleration tends to get easier at higher energies due to the increasing muon lifetime , smaller beam sizes and lower circulation frequencies in recirculating linacs .",
    "hence , the technical feasibility of acceleration up to the energies in the table is automatically established to a large extent by the assumed previous success of the acceleration at a tev - scale @xmath0 collider . as a minor caveat to this , harrison pointed out the increased load due to synchrotron radiation in the ffags .",
    "however , the collider ring magnets will need to handle the synchrotron radiation load for many times more turns than the ffag arcs , so even this technical difficulty is concentrated more in the collider ring than the accelerating lattice .",
    "berg  @xcite pointed out that slightly increased technical difficulties might instead be expected for the _ low energy _",
    "end of the acceleration for parameter sets a and , especially , b. this could result from the higher specified values for the longitudinal emittance in the many - tev parameter sets : table  [ colliderpara ] shows the longitudinal emittances for these parameter sets to be , respectively , similar to , and about twice as large as , the longitudinal emittance for the 3 tev parameter set of reference  @xcite .",
    "all muon collider detectors face challenging backgrounds resulting from the electron daughters of decaying muons near the interaction point . however , the amount of electromagnetic `` junk '' entering the detector is relatively independent of the collider energy since the power density of deposited electromagnetic energy depends primarily on the beam current rather than the beam energy .",
    "( for confirmation of this statement , see the values in the `` power density into magnet liner '' row of table  [ colliderpara ] . ) hence , such backgrounds are expected to be manageable for these many - tev parameter sets under the stated assumption that the problem has already been solved at tev - scale collider detectors .",
    "( a specific strategy for handling these backgrounds that was developed at the workshop is described in reference  @xcite of these proceedings . )",
    "muons entering the side of the detector , either from beam halo or bethe - heitler @xmath0 pair production , are the one background that is expected to evolve markedly with energy .",
    "as muons become more relativistic they become less and less like minimum - ionizing particles and deposit larger amounts of energy `` catastrophically '' in , mainly , electromagnetic showers .",
    "this issue was not addressed at the workshop and it deserves further study .",
    "parameter sets a and b assume only evolutionary improvements in the ionization cooling performance over that assumed ( but far from demonstrated  @xcite ! ) for tev - scale colliders so , by definition , the beam cooling should probably be ok if following on from the tev - scale collider .",
    "parameter set c is very different , assuming that some form of exotic cooling will be able to increase the phase space density of the muon beams by three orders of magnitude from that assumed for parameter set b.    such ultra - cold muon beams are still looking plausible but have not yet progressed beyond that .",
    "the most promising of the exotic cooling methods is optical stochastic cooling  @xcite .",
    "this method clearly has formidable technical challenges but no obvious show - stoppers .",
    "other , very low energy , cooling methods were also presented at the workshop  @xcite .",
    "there is some concern that any cooling method using non - relativistic muons ( i.e. with scaled velocity @xmath2 ) may well not be feasible for preparing the high - charge muon bunches needed for colliders , due to space charge limitations .",
    "it is noted that parameter set c provides a specific example of a general feature for ultra - cold muon beams . since the collisions at many - tev colliders",
    "would normally be tune - shift limited anyway , it is likely that improved cooling would also require ip compensation to substantially benefit the luminosity .",
    "we now discuss yet another barrier to the use of ultra - cold beams , at least at very high energies , from synchrotron radiation .",
    "it has already been noted that the synchrotron radiation power in the 100 tev colliders is already comparable to the beam power . during the workshop ,",
    "telnov  @xcite raised what might possibly be a stronger constraint from synchrotron radiation on the energy reach of circular muon colliders , namely , the quantum nature of synchrotron radiation may lead to heating , rather than damping , of the horizontal beam emittance if the beam energy is high enough and the emittance is already very small .",
    "telnov s observation clearly spells the end of parameter set c , with its ultra - cold beam at @xmath3 tev .",
    "the other parameter set at 100 tev ( set b ) is also borderline , with an initial horizontal emittance that is larger by a factor of five  @xcite than the equilibrium emittance due to this effect , as calculated by telnov using a simple approximate model .",
    "the most likely possible loop - hole for parameter set b is that the heating effect is reduced for a very strongly focusing collider lattice .",
    "more specifically , telnov s equation 2 shows the equilibrium emittance to be proportional to the average of the `` h - function '' around the collider ring , where @xmath4 for @xmath5 the standard courant - snyder parameter and @xmath6 the collider ring s radius .",
    "( stronger focusing corresponds to smaller @xmath5 values around the ring . )    to consider adjustments to parameter set b , equation  [ h ] suggests that 100 tev colliders with the emittances expected from ionization cooling still look to be feasible by increasing the ring radius , @xmath6 , by , for example , a factor of two .",
    "this would lower both the equilibrium emittance by a factor of four and the radiated energy per turn by a factor of two , which is substantial compensation for halving the number of collisions per bunch .",
    "a much more dramatic approach to beating the energy limits from synchrotron radiation has come from zimmermann  @xcite , in the form of single pass linear @xmath0 colliders .",
    "example parameter sets are included in zimmermann s paper , and are commented on in more detail elsewhere in these proceedings  @xcite .",
    "the final focus design extrapolations discussed in section  [ sec : collider ] seemed to work well for the 10 tev parameter set a. a magnet layout for the final focus from johnstone  @xcite closely reproduced the predicted @xmath7 in table  [ colliderpara ] .",
    "further , the lattice design experts at the workshop seemed to appreciate the extremely challenging nature of the 10 tev final focus parameters without everybody actually condemning them as being clearly unrealistic , i.e. , an appropriate level of difficulty for a workshop of this nature !",
    "see reference  @xcite for more detailed studies and comments .    the 100 tev parameter sets were less fortunate .",
    "even the `` evolutionary '' parameter set b was immediately dismissed by the lattice experts as being incompatible with any final focus lattice designs using conventional magnets .",
    "it will be very useful to get further feedback on what exactly broke down in the simplistic energy extrapolation that was described in section  [ subsec : collider_gen ] .",
    "hopefully , such feedback can then be used to obtain a better parameterization of the energy evolution in the final focus parameters .",
    "a more realistic and better established parameterization could then be used to predict the luminosity scaling with energy that might be expected using conventional final focus technologies .",
    "finally , two exotic final focus options were discussed that might go beyond conventional magnet designs : `` dynamic focusing '' ( using auxiliary beams to focus the colliding beams ) and plasma focusing . discouragingly , both options looked much less plausible than when considered for single pass @xmath8 colliders , due to both the need for multiple passes and the larger bunch currents assumed for @xmath0 collider parameters . also disappointing are the obstacles to beam compensation at collision ( as was assumed in parameter set c ) , which call into question the possibility of being able to do this  see reference  @xcite for discussion on this topic .",
    "papers by keil  @xcite and zimmermann  @xcite provide studies on beam instabilities .",
    "keil provides a systematic assessment of the classes of instabilities , including parameter comparisons with the lhc collider ring .",
    "zimmermann s tracking studies demonstrated that even circulating the beams for a single turn should not be taken for granted , let alone for of order 1000 turns over the lifetime of the muons .",
    "as a connection to the physics capabilities of the collider ring that needs to be borne in mind , the common assumption  @xcite of collider rings that are isochronous is disfavored for retaining the beam polarization .",
    "( see also reference  @xcite for a discussion on the importance of polarization . ) as a rough hand - waving explanation , the rate of polarization precession while circulating in the collider ring is proportional to the muon s energy .",
    "it is intuitively clear that the polarization will decay away more slowly if the energies of all the particles are allowed to slosh around the beam average energy  sometimes gaining in polarization precession ( higher energy ) over the bunch average precession and sometimes losing ( lower energy than the bunch average ) .",
    "this is what happens in a collider ring with longitudinal focusing as opposed to isochronous rings .",
    "the same argument also favors small beam energy spreads .",
    "the preceding section has reviewed the insights from hemc99 on the parameter sets of tables  [ colliderpara ] and  [ accel ] .",
    "more generally than this , hemc99 has provided the first speculative insights into ( i ) the ultimate physics potential for future colliders at the high energy frontier and ( ii ) the potential challenges to reaching very high energies with muon colliders .",
    "a personal interpretation of the workshop s findings through the energy decades is :    * * muon colliders to the tev scale : * ( added for completeness ",
    "these energies were not discussed in detail at the workshop ) beam cooling is the dominant technical challenge .",
    "other major challenges are the final focus region , backgrounds in the detector , cost - efficient acceleration and beam stability throughout the cooling , acceleration and storage in the collider ring",
    ". neutrino radiation will impose significant design constraints and the beam currents may be well below those for the straw - man parameters in reference  @xcite ( i.e. @xmath9 muons / sign / year in collision ) . * * to advance to the 10 tev scale : * neutrino radiation will probably dictate a new site .",
    "the final focus region of the collider and magnet cost reduction for acceleration may be the other major technical design issues . * * to advance to the 100 tev scale : * major breakthroughs are needed in magnet costs and in the final focus region . * * to advance to the 1 pev scale and beyond : * this is not absolutely ruled out in the far distant future using a linac and many technological breakthroughs , as illustrated by the parameter set in reference  @xcite and discussed further in reference  @xcite .",
    "it would certainly be very valuable to follow up on the understandings gained at this workshop . as a small first step , modified",
    "parameter sets for many - tev muon colliders are being generated  @xcite that take into account the insights gained at hemc99 .",
    "as a refinement to make interpolations easier , a parameter set at the intermediate center - of - mass energy of 30 tev will be included .",
    "more substantially , there is need for a new study and workshop .",
    "preferably , this should include all three of the main accelerator technologies ",
    "pp , @xmath8 and @xmath0 colliders .",
    "this is motivated  @xcite both for a more coherent understanding of the future of experimental high energy physics and in recognition that the three accelerator technologies are deeply intertwined .",
