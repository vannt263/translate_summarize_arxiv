    "it is a well established fact that the maximum of the spectral energy distribution of quasars occures in the largely unobservable spectral range between the extrem uv and the soft x - ray domain . in many objects a steepening of the spectrum in the soft x - ray range as compared to the hard x - rays is observed which , in combination with the turnover of the spectrum in the uv range , suggests that these two components combine in the largely unobservable range between @xmath5 hz and @xmath6 hz to form the so called big blue bump emission",
    ". continued attempts have been made to derive a self - consistent emission model which is able to account for this spectral component , the most probable scenario being thermal emission from an accretion disk around a central super - massive compact object .",
    "the theory of standard geometrically thin @xmath2-accretion disks is largely based on the paper of shakura & sunyaev ( @xcite ) and a general relativistic version presented by novikov & thorne ( @xcite ) .",
    "it has soon turned out that simple accretion disk models based on multi - temperature blackbody emission from an optically thick accretion disk ( malkan & sargent @xcite , malkan @xcite ) , at sub - eddington accretion rates , are not sufficiently hot , or else that highly super - eddington accretion rates would be required , for the accretion disk to emit an appreciable fraction of the radiation in the soft x - ray range ( bechtold @xcite ) .",
    "a number of authors have improved this simple model by considering various effects on the structure and emission spectrum of the disk .",
    "czerny & elvis ( @xcite ) , and wandel & petrosian ( @xcite ) calculated the radiative transfer by including free - free opacities and the effects of comptonization in a simple analytic manner . bound - free opacities as well as relativistic effects were included by laor & netzer ( @xcite ) and laor et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "most computations of model spectra to date , however , adopted a given vertical structure or made use of an averaging in the vertical direction .",
    "a detailed investigation of the emission spectrum was performed by ross , fabian , & mineshige ( @xcite ) , using the kompaneets equation ( kompaneets @xcite ) to treat compton scattering and including free - free and bound - free opacities of hydrogen and helium .",
    "they solved the vertical temperature structure and atomic level populations for a predetermined constant vertical density profile .",
    "a self - consistent solution of the vertical structure and radiative transfer is given by shimura & takahara ( @xcite ) and shimura & takahara ( @xcite ) for a newtonian disk . in their viscosity description , they made the ad hoc assumption that the local heating rate is proportional to the mass density . in our approach ( drrer et al .",
    "@xcite ) , the vertical structure and radiation field of a disk around a kerr black hole is calculated in a self - consistent way .",
    "moreover , we use a different viscosity description . in section 4 a short review of this model",
    "is given .",
    "in the framework of the unified model the different properties of active galactic nuclei are explained as being due to the different inclination angles under which the observer sees the accretion disk as well as various additional components such as absorbing material , emisssion line clouds or jets .",
    "the emission from the accretion disk is best studied in objects seen under intermediate inclination angles where the disk emission is neither obscured by an absorbing gas and dust torus nor is it swamped by beamed emission from a relativistic jet ( in systems seen nearly face on ) .",
    "such intermediate inclination angles are thought to lead to source properties as observed in radio - quiet quasars and seyfert i galaxies .",
    "thus , high signal - to - noise data , covering the spectral range from the uv to the soft x - ray range , of samples of such objects are best suited to investigate whether their broad - band spectra may be understood in terms of emission from an accretion disk .",
    "we have selected a sample of 31 radio - quiet quasars ( see section 2 for a discussion of the selection criteria ) , which were observed both by iue in the energy range from 130 to 305  nm and by rosat in the energy range from 0.1  kev ( @xmath3 3  nm ) to 2.4  kev ( @xmath3 0.5  nm ) in order to investigate whether the uv and soft x - ray spectra of these objects are in agreement with predictions based on our accretion disk emission model .",
    "the x - ray emission in the rosat energy band consists of at least two components , a hard power law component , extending to higher x - ray energies , beyond the rosat energy range , and a soft component , known under the name of soft x - ray excess emission , which in many agn dominates the spectrum at energies below @xmath3 0.5  kev and which is widely thought to originate in the inner part of an accretion disk .",
    "testing the predictions of our accretion disk model thus requires to separate the contributions of these two emission components . due to the limited energy resolution of rosat and also due to its limited spectral coverage at higher x - ray energies ( @xmath7 2.4  kev ) , except for the brightest objects ,",
    "this is not possible based on the rosat data alone .",
    "we therefore make use of published hard x - ray spectral slopes to separate the two emission components in our spectral fits . as a first approach",
    "we have compared spectra from deep rosat pointings with the hard power law spectra taken from the literature , to convince ourselves that soft excess emission is indeed present in almost all of the objects ( see section 3 ) .",
    "things are further complicated by the fact that in the uv range different spectral components contribute to the emission .",
    "we treat this by including an additional power law component in our model fits extending from the ir with an exponential cutoff at around @xmath8 hz .",
    "details on the model fitting performed and on the resulting distributions of the four accretion disk model parameters central mass @xmath9 , mass accretion rate @xmath10 , viscosity parameter @xmath2 , and the inclination angle @xmath11 can be found in section 5 . a similar study using data from the rosat all sky survey based on an earlier version of the present accretion disk model is presented by friedrich et al .",
    "a brief comparison of the two models and a summary of basic results is given in staubert et al .",

    "one possible interpretation for the turnover of the @xmath31 relation is that , as one goes to lower and lower redshifts , lower luminosity objects are detected where the accretion disk component is increasingly absorbed and the spectrum is increasingly dominated by the hard power law component .",
    "we would finally like to point out that the observed hardening of the rosat spectral indices with redshift rules out the possiblity that the steep agn spectra observed by rosat may , as has been suggested , in part be due to errors in the cross - calibration of the rosat pspc detector and previous higher energy x - ray instruments .",
    "for the steep x - ray spectrum ( @xmath34 ) subsample ( 17 objects ) a strong correlation of the rosat spectral index ( fixed @xmath20 ) and the optical to x - ray broad - band spectral index is found ( see fig . [ aoxafix ] ) .",
    "the correlation index is 0.78 ( spearman rank correlation coefficient ) , corresponding to a probability of @xmath35 of randomness .",
    "this suggests that in objects with strong soft x - ray excess emission , i.e. , objects with steep rosat spectra , the dominant contributions to the x - ray and uv / optical emission are due to the same physical emission component ( i.e. , the big blue bump emission ) . while the correlation can also be traced to objects with lower rosat spectral indices , a number of these objects show broad - band spectral indices which are considerably steeper than predicted by the correlation , suggesting that in these objects , the onset of the big blue bump emission is at or below the lower cutoff of the rosat sensitivity window .",
    "note that a fraction of these objects ( marked by filled triangles in fig .",
    "[ aoxafix ] ) are at higher redshifts ( @xmath36 ) where any blue bump emission component is expected to be shifted out of the rosat sensitivity window .",
    "objects marked as open diamonds in fig . [ aoxafix ] which also do not seem to follow the correlation are seen through absorbing column densities @xmath37 @xmath38 and may thus be affected by uncertainties in the rosat power law index ( fixed @xmath20 ) and possibly the de - reddening of the optical fluxes .",
    "similar correlations of @xmath1 and @xmath39 have also been reported by puchnarewicz et al .",
    "while the change in spectral slope between the rosat and harder x - ray energy bands as well as the @xmath40 correlation are useful indicators for the soft x - ray excess and big blue bump emission , a quantitative analysis is best performed in the framework of a physical emission model , the most widely advocated candidate being emission from the hot inner region of an accretion disk around a super - massive central object .",
    "we assume a standard geometrically thin @xmath2-accretion disk around a massive kerr black hole .",
    "a detailed description of our model is given in drrer et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . here",
    ", we just summarize the basic concepts of the calculations .",
    "model parameters are the mass @xmath9 of the central black hole , the accretion rate @xmath10 , the viscosity parameter @xmath2 , and the specific angular momentum @xmath41 of the central black hole . in addition to the parameters describing the physical properties of the accretion disks the inclination angle under which the observer sees the disk is also a free parameter .",
    "the specific angular momentum @xmath41 of the central black hole was fixed at @xmath42 in our spectral fits .",
    "all relativistic corrections on the disk structure with respect to a newtonian model are included according to riffert & herold ( @xcite ) .",
    "the radiative transfer is solved in the eddington approximation , and the plasma is assumed to be in a state of local thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "multiple compton scattering is treated in the fokker - planck approximation using the kompaneets operator .",
    "the absorption cross section contains only free - free processes for a pure hydrogen atmosphere .",
    "induced contributions to the radiative processes have been neglected throughout .    for a given radial distance @xmath43 from the central black hole , a self - consistent solution of the vertical structure and radiation field of the disk is obtained from the hydrostatic equilibrium equation , radiative transfer equation , energy balance equation , and equation of state , when proper boundary conditions are imposed .",
    "note , that we have not considered convection in our model .    in our calculations",
    "the viscosity is assumed to be entirely due to turbulence .",
    "because the standard @xmath2-description ( viscosity proportional to the total pressure ) leads to diverging temperature profiles in the upper parts of the disk , we have included the radiative energy loss of the turbulent elements in the optically thin regime .",
    "for the turbulent viscosity we then have    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the shear viscosity , @xmath46 is the mass density , @xmath47 is the self - consistently calculated height of the disk , @xmath48 is the upper limit for the velocity of the largest turbulent elements ( see drrer et al .",
    "@xcite for details on the determination of @xmath48 ) and @xmath2 is the viscosity parameter of our model .",
    "we used a finite difference scheme in the vertical direction @xmath49 and in frequency space @xmath50 to find solutions of the given set of equations .",
    "the vertical structure was resolved with 100 points on a logarithmic grid , and 64 grid points were used in frequency space .",
    "the resulting set of algebraic difference equations was then solved by a newton - raphson method .    to get the overall structure and emission spectrum of the disk we calculated the vertical structure and the local emission spectrum at @xmath51 logarithmically spaced radial grid points from the last stable orbit to the outer disk radius ( here @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the schwarzschild radius",
    ", @xmath54 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath55 is the velocity of light ) .",
    "the whole disk spectrum as seen by a distant observer at an inclination angle @xmath56 with respect to the disk axis ( @xmath57 for a face - on observer ) is then calculated by integration of the local spectra over the disk surface .",
    "all general relativistic effects on the propagation of photons from the disk surface to the observer are included , using a program code ( speith et al .",
    "1995 ) to obtain values of the cunningham transfer function ( cunningham @xcite ) for any set of parameters .",
    "the accretion disk spectrum as determined from the above calculations extends from the optical to the soft x - ray range ( @xmath7 1 kev ) , the maximum of the emission being in the far uv .",
    "qualitatively , the dependence of the spectral shape on the model parameters is such that , if the mass accretion rate @xmath10 is kept at a constant fraction of the eddington accretion rate @xmath58 , the central mass @xmath9 mainly determines the total flux while approximately maintainig the spectral shape .",
    "increasing the mass accretion rate in terms of the eddington accretion rate @xmath59 , on the other hand , while also increasing the total flux , makes the spectrum harder , i.e. a larger fraction of the flux is emitted in the x - ray range .",
    "similarly , an increase of the viscosity parameter @xmath2 also leads to a hardening of the spectrum .",
    "going from low ( disk seen face on ) to high ( disk seen edge on ) inclination angles of the accretion disk , the total flux from the disk is reduced and at the same time a hardening of the spectrum due to doppler boosting resulting from the rotation of the disk occures .",
    "we have performed @xmath60 fits to the uv to soft x - ray continuum spectra of the 31 sample quasars in order to investigate whether the observed spectra are indeed in agreement with our model , i.e. whether satisfactory best - fit minimum @xmath60 values are achieved and the resulting accretion disk model parameters are in line with our general understanding of the quasar phenomenon .    as already mentioned in the introduction , in order to separate the accretion disk emission from the underlying hard power law spectrum , where available we took the spectral index for the hard power law from the literature ( _ einstein observatory _ , exosat , ginga ; malaguti et al . , 1994 ) .",
    "otherwise , a canonical value of @xmath61 was adopted .",
    "x - ray variability between the observation in the soft and hard x - ray bands was allowed for by treating the normalization of the hard power law spectrum as a free parameter .",
    "the spectral indices and references used are listed in table [ fitpar ] .",
    "we have not included infrared and optical data in the spectral analysis , because such measurements were not available for all of the sample members and many different emission components ( non - thermal synchrotron emission , thermal dust emission , blr and nlr line emission , emission from the host galaxy ) would needlessly complicate the analysis .",
    "emission components at low frequencies which in addition to the accretion disk also contribute to the emission in the uv range were incorporated into the model by assuming a power law component with spectral index @xmath62 and an exponential cutoff in the extreme uv range ( @xmath63 hz ) which mainly represents the non - thermal synchrotron component .",
    "interstellar low energy x - ray absorption is included in our spectral fits by using the galactic hydrogen column densities by stark et al .",
    "@xcite and elvis et al .",
    "@xcite and by applying the cross sections by morrison & mc cammon ( @xcite ) .",
    "note that the de - reddening of the uv data , based on the same hydrogen column densities , was already applied to the data prior to the spectral fitting ( see section 2 ) .",
    "we did not consider intrinsic absorption in the accretion disk model fitting .",
    "this is justified as no evidence for intrinsic absorption was found in our spectral power law fits and , generally , high luminosity objects ( i.e. quasars as opposed to lower luminosity agn ) at moderate redshifts are not expected to show large amounts of intrinsic absorption .",
    "the total fit function thus includes three components with a total of six free parameters :    \\1 . accretion disk model with four free parameters ( @xmath9,@xmath10,@xmath2 , @xmath56 )    \\2 . underlying hard power law with a slope taken from the literature ( free normalization )    \\3 .",

    "model spectra were computed by linear interpolation .",
    ".grid of accretion disk model parameters [ cols=\"<,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     simultaneous fits of the rosat and iue data were performed by folding the model x - ray fluxes with the response of the rosat pspc detector to determine the rosat count rates predicted by our model in each spectral bin .",
    "the uv fluxes predicted by the model were compared directly with the de - reddened iue continuum fluxes ( see section 3 ) .",

    "note that both @xmath9 and @xmath59 contribute to the total luminosity of the disk ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "since in the optical spectral range the emission is dominated by the accretion disk while at x - ray energies a large fraction of the emission is supplied by the hard power law component , an increase of either @xmath9 or @xmath59 predominantly affects the optical emission and thus results in an increase of the broad - band spectral index @xmath1 , in agreement with the observed correlations . by increasing the viscosity parameter",
    "@xmath2 a larger part of the disk emission is radiated in the x - ray range , thus resulting in a hardening of the broad - band spectral index @xmath1 , again in agreement with observations .    a statistical comparison of the sample properties of agn from the rosat all sky survey using a simpler precursor version of the present accretion disk code has been performed by friedrich et al .",
    "( @xcite ) which is in broad agreement with the present study .",
    "however , using the improved model , considerably smaller mass accretion rates are sufficient to produce the observed x - ray emission .",
    "this is mainly because , contrary to the simpler version , our improved model also takes into account the temperature gradient in the vertical direction of the disk .",
    "this means that the local spectra differ from the blackbody even in the optically thick case , leading to harder spectra for the same parameter values .",
    "we are aware that the accretion disk model fitting performed leaves many open ends .",
    "i.e. , contributions from other ingredients of the agn phenomenon such as non - stationary processes in the disk , illumination of the disk , effects on the spectrum due to reflection and due to an absorbing torus have been neglected . however , the fact that in most cases acceptable fits of our accretion disk model were achieved has strengthend our belief that , for the objects selected , to first order this approach is justified .",
    "we thus have demonstrated that the ` naked ' ( excluding the above modifications ) accretion disk model is a viable , and in fact we think the most promising candidate , for understanding the soft x - ray excess and big blue bump emission in at least some classes of agn ( radio - quiet quasars and seyfert i galaxies ) .",
    "further modeling including some of the above ingredients will , however , be highly desirable , particularly when considering the availability before the end of the century of x - ray instruments with much improved sensitivity , spectral resolution , and spectral coverage .",
