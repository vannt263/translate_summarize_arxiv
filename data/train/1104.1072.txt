    "this supplement describes in detail the patterning procedure for mtj fabrication , which is based on optical lithography and ar ion milling .",

    "the mtjs were patterned in four steps , which we denote as ( i ) feed line patterning , ( ii ) edge isolation , ( iii ) metallization and ( iv ) junction milling .    during ar@xmath73-milling ( beam energy @xmath74kev ) ,",
    "the sample was mounted on a water - cooled ( @xmath75c ) copper block which reduces heating of the sample .",
    "a shutter in front of the sample was used to mill in intervals of @xmath76s open and @xmath77s closed .",

    "this step defines the feed lines of the mtj .",
    "figure  [ figs1 ]  ( a ) shows a cross section of the as - grown sample , indicating the stacking sequence . the two f - lsmo electrodes are separated by 6 uc thick sto barrier layer ( black ) , and the sample was covered in - situ by a @xmath78 nm thick au layer ( yellow ) , for protection against humidity and chemicals during the patterning process . in a first step , the sample was coated by photoresist ( pr ) which was patterned by optical lithography [ c.f .",

    "<S> the strength of pinning of one electrode magnetization via exchange bias has a noticeable influence on the tmr both by enlarging the magnetic field window of antiparallel alignments and inducing an asymmetry in the @xmath32 curves , but is also very sensitive to the cooling history . </S>",
    "<S> the polar plot of tmr@xmath72 demonstrates that uniaxial anisotropy in the f layers is not necessary for high tmr . </S>",
    "<S> it is reasonable that interface roughness , oxygen vacancies and the interface growth play a crucial role in the exchange bias mechanism in these manganite interfaces as has been demonstrated in more conventional eb systems @xcite , and merits further study . </S>",
