    "the last stages of the evolution of the most massive ( m@xmath12m@xmath13 ) stars may be dominated by episodic large mass - ejections  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this leads to dust condensing out of the ejecta , obscuring the star in the optical but revealing it in the mid - infrared ( mid - ir ) as the absorbed uv and optical photons are re - emitted at longer wavelengths  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the best known example is @xmath0carinae ( @xmath0car ) which contains one of the most massive ( 100 - 150@xmath14 ) and most luminous ( @xmath15 ) stars in our galaxy  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "its great eruption in the mid-1800s led to the ejection of @xmath16 of material  @xcite now seen as a dusty nebula around the star .",
    "while ongoing studies are helping us further analyze the great eruption ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , deciphering the rate of such events and their consequences is challenging because no analog of this extraordinary laboratory for stellar astrophysics ( in terms of stellar mass , luminosity , ejecta mass , time since mass ejection etc . )",
    "has previously been found .",
    "a related puzzle is the existence of the typeii superluminous supernovae ( slsn - ii ) that are plausibly explained by the sn ejecta colliding with a massive shell of previously ejected material  ( e.g. , sn2006gy ; * ? ? ?",
    "a number of sne , such as the typeib sn2006jc @xcite and the typeiin sn2009ip ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have also shown transients that could be associated with mass ejections shortly prior to the final explosion .",
    "but the relationship between these transients and @xmath0car or other lbvs surrounded by still older , massive dusty shells  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is unclear .",
    "there are presently no clear prescriptions for how to include events like the great eruption into theoretical models .",
    "even basic assumptions  such as whether the mass loss is triggered by the final post - carbon ignition phase as suggested statistically by  @xcite or by an opacity phase - transition in the photosphere  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or by interactions with a binary companion  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* )  are uncertain .",
    "studies of possible mass - loss mechanisms  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are unfortunately non - prescriptive on either rate or outcome .",
    "observationally , we are limited by the small numbers of high mass stars in this short evolutionary phase and searching for them in the galaxy is complicated by having to look through the crowded , dusty disk and distance uncertainties .",
    "obtaining a better understanding of this phase of evolution requires exploring other galaxies .",
    "we demonstrated in  @xcite that searching for extragalactic self - obscured stars utilizing _ spitzer _ images is feasible , and in @xcite we isolated an emerging class of 18 candidate self - obscured stars with @xmath17 ( @xmath18-@xmath19 ) in galaxies at @xmath20mpc .",
    "we have now expanded our search to the large star - forming galaxies m51 , m83 , m101 and ngc6946 ( distance@xmath21mpc ) .",
    "we picked these galaxies because they have high star formation rates ( total @xmath22yr , mainly based on @xcite ) and hosted significant numbers of core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) over the past century  ( total 20 , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , indicating that they are likely to host a significant number of evolved high mass stars .    in this letter",
    ", we announce the discovery of five objects in these galaxies that have optical through mid - ir photometric properties consistent with the hitherto unique @xmath0car as it is presently observed . in what follows ,",
    "we describe our search method ( section[sec : data ] ) , analyze the physical properties of the five potential @xmath0car analogs ( section[sec : analysis ] ) and consider the implications of our findings ( section[sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "at extragalactic distances , an @xmath0car analog would appear as a bright , red point - source in _ spitzer _ irac  @xcite images , with a fainter optical counterpart due to self - obscuration . given enough absorption , the optical counterpart could be undetectable .",
    "building on our previous work  @xcite , we relied on these properties to identify the @xmath0car analog candidates . for m51  ( d@xmath23mpc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , m83  ( d@xmath24mpc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and m101  ( d@xmath25mpc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we used the full _ spitzer _ mosaics available from the local volume legacy survey  ( lvl , * ? ? ? * ) , and for ngc6946  ( d@xmath26mpc , * ? ? ? * ) we used those from the _ spitzer _ infrared nearby galaxies survey ( sings , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we built vega - calibrated irac@xmath3 and mips  @xcite @xmath5 point - source catalogs for each galaxy following the procedures described in  @xcite .",
    "we use psf photometry at @xmath27 and @xmath28 , a combination of psf and aperture photometry ( preferring psf ) at @xmath29 , and only aperture photometry at @xmath30 and @xmath5 as the psf size and pah emission both increase toward longer wavelengths . for all sources ,",
    "we determine the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) slope @xmath31  ( @xmath32 ) , the total irac luminosity ( @xmath33 ) and the fraction @xmath34 of @xmath33 that is emitted in the first three irac bands .",
    "following the selection criteria established in  @xcite  @xmath35l@xmath13 , @xmath36 and @xmath37  we initially selected @xmath38 sources from our mid - ir point - source catalogs .",
    "we examined the irac images to exclude the sources associated with saturated , resolved or foreground objects , and utilized the vizier web - service to rule out spectroscopically confirmed non - stellar sources and those with high proper motions .",
    "we inspected the @xmath39 seds of the remaining sources to identify the ones that most closely resemble the sed of @xmath0car and then queried the hubble source catalog ( hsc , version1 ) to exclude those with bright optical counterparts ( m@xmath40mag , implying @xmath41 ) .",
    "these steps produced a short - list of @xmath42 sources for which we retrieved archival hst images and the associated photometry from the hubble legacy archive ( hla ) .",
    "since the hst and _ spitzer _ images sometimes have significant ( @xmath43 ) astrometric mismatches , we utilized the iraf geomap and geoxytran tasks to locally align the hst and _ spitzer _ images with uncertainties @xmath44 .",
    "we then searched for the closest optical counterpart within a matching radius of @xmath45 .",
    "we identified five sources with mid - ir seds closely resembling that of @xmath0car and optical fluxes or flux limits @xmath7dex fainter than their mid - ir peaks .",
    "we will refer to these sources as @xmath0twins-1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 .",
    "we find one source each in m51 ( @xmath0twin-1 ) , m101 ( @xmath0twin-2 ) and ngc6946 ( @xmath0twin-3 ) , and two sources in m83 ( @xmath0twins-4 , 5 ) .",
    "we identified hst counterparts of @xmath0twins-1 , 2 and 4 within the @xmath45 matching radius . for @xmath0twin-3 ,",
    "no hst source is cataloged within the matching radius , so we visually identified the closest location of flux excess at @xmath46 , and used simple aperture photometry techniques to measure the @xmath47-band flux and the @xmath48 and @xmath49 band flux upper limits . for @xmath0twin-5 , although a cataloged hst source exists within the @xmath45 matching radius , we selected a different source at @xmath50 as the more likely photometric match because it is also a bright hst @xmath51-band source . table[tab : photo ] lists the photometry of these sources , figure[fig:1 ] shows their irac@xmath52 and hst @xmath47-band images , and figure[fig:2 ] shows their seds",
    ". @xmath0twins-1 , 4 and 5 are h@xmath53 emitters and @xmath0twin-2 is a uv source ( see table[tab : photo ] ) .",
    "we have @xmath54 variability data for m51 , m101 and ngc6946 from the lbc survey for failed supernovae @xcite .",
    "we analyzed 21/26/37  epochs of data spanning a 7.1/7.2/8  year period for m51/m101/ngc6946 with the isis image subtraction package  @xcite .",
    "we did not detect any significant optical variability at the locations of @xmath0twins-1 , 2 or 3 .",
    "@xcite identified @xmath0twin-2 as a wise point source and we use their @xmath55 flux measurement as an upper limit for sed models ( section[sec : analysis ] ) .",
    "@xcite reports an optically thick free - free radio source located @xmath56 from @xmath0twin-3 and  @xcite identified a source with wolf - rayet spectroscopic signature @xmath57 from @xmath0twin-4 .",
    "we could not confirm if these sources are reasonable astrometric matches to the irac locations .",
    "@xmath0twins-4 and 5 were cataloged by  @xcite but not flagged as massive stars .",
    "we fit the seds of these five sources using dusty  @xcite to model radiation transfer through a spherical medium surrounding a blackbody source , which is also a good approximation for a combination of unresolved non - spherical / patchy / multiple circumstellar shells .",
    "we considered models with either graphitic or silicate dust  @xcite .",
    "the models are defined by the stellar luminosity ( @xmath58 ) , stellar temperature ( @xmath59 ) , @xmath49-band optical depth ( @xmath60 ) , dust temperature at the inner - edge of the shell ( @xmath61 ) and shell thickness @xmath62 .",
    "we embedded dusty inside a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) driver to fit each sed by varying @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 with @xmath58 determined by a @xmath63 fit for each model .",
    "we fix @xmath64 since its exact value has little effect on the results @xcite , limit @xmath59 to a maximum value of @xmath65k , set the minimum flux uncertainty to @xmath66 ( 0.1magnitude ) and do not account for distance uncertainties .",
    "the best fit model parameters determine the radius of the inner edge of the stellar - ejecta distribution ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "the mass of the shell is @xmath68 ( scaled to a visual opacity of @xmath69@xmath70 g ) and the age estimate for the shell is @xmath71 ( scaled as @xmath72kms@xmath73 ) where we can ignore @xmath74 to zeroth order .",
    "table[tab : mcmc ] reports the parameters of the best fit models and figure[fig:2 ] shows these models .",
    "the integrated luminosity estimates depend little on the choice of dust type , and are in the range of @xmath75 .",
    "we also fit the seds using @xcite stellar atmosphere models instead of blackbodies .",
    "since these resulted in similar parameter estimates , we only report the blackbody results .",
    "generally , the best fits derived for graphitic dust require lower optical depths , lower dust temperatures and larger shell radii , leading to higher ejecta masses and age estimates .",
    "for @xmath0twins-2 and 4 , the stellar temperature estimates reach the allowed maximum of @xmath65k .",
    "the best fit models of @xmath0twin-1 and 5 also require the presence of a hot star , but with temperatures lower than the allowed maximum ( @xmath76k and @xmath77k for graphitic / silicate dust ) .",
    "constrained by the low optical flux , the best fit models of @xmath0twin-3 require the presence of a cool star ( @xmath78k ) . for @xmath0twins-2 , 4 and 5 , the best fits derived for graphitic dust had lower @xmath63 , and for for @xmath0twins-1 and 3 the best fits derived for silicate dust have lower @xmath63 . considering these models , the @xmath0car analog candidates appear to be embedded in @xmath8 of warm ( @xmath6k ) obscuring material ejected a few centuries ago .",
    "figure[fig:3 ] contrasts the bolometric luminosities and ejecta mass estimates of these five objects with the relatively less luminous sources we identified in  @xcite .",
    "the five new sources form a distinct cluster close to @xmath0car in the @xmath79 parameter space , whereas the previously identified dusty - star candidates from  @xcite are more similar to the galactic oh / ir star irc+10420  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or m33 s variablea  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "to an extragalactic observer located in one of the targeted galaxies surveying the milky way with telescopes similar to the hst and _ spitzer _ , @xmath0car s present day sed would appear nearly identical to the extragalactic @xmath0car analog candidates we found .",
    "the carina nebula is @xmath80 in extent @xcite corresponding to @xmath81 at our most distant galaxy ( m51 at 8mpc ) . while this would not be resolved by _",
    ", it would be easily resolved by hst . because more compact clusters are not uncommon , in  @xcite we considered whether dusty clusters can hide @xmath0car like stars and if we would confuse unresolved star - clusters with @xmath0car analogs . in general",
    ", a cluster sufficiently luminous to hide an evolved @xmath82 star has hosted many luminous stars with strong uv radiation fields and winds , which will generally clear the cluster of the gas and dust needed to produce strong mid - ir emission over the timescale that even the most massive star needs to evolve away from the main sequence . moreover , emission from warm circumstellar ejecta peaks between the irac@xmath83 and mips@xmath5 bands and then turns over , as seen in all of our candidates , unlike emission from colder intra - cluster dust that generally peaks at longer wavelengths .",
    "a significant majority of massive stars are expected to be in multiple - star systems  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as is the case for @xmath0car  ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is a minor complication , affecting luminosity estimates by at most a factor of @xmath84 , and mass estimates even less .",
    "assuming all the candidates we have identified are real analogs of @xmath0car , then our galaxy sample ( including the milky way ) contains @xmath85 @xmath0car - like stars .",
    "based on the ratio of star formation rates ( @xmath84 vs. @xmath86yr ) , our original sample of @xmath87 galaxies would be expected to have @xmath88 @xmath0car analog , which is statistically consistent with not finding one in  @xcite .",
    "if we expand our simple rate estimates from @xcite , our @xmath85 sources implies an eruption rate over the @xmath89 galaxies ( @xmath87 previous , @xmath90 in this work , and the milky way ) of @xmath91yr@xmath73 ( @xmath92yr@xmath93yr@xmath73 at 90% confidence ) where @xmath94yrs is a rough estimate of the period over which our method would detect an @xmath0car - like source . for comparison ,",
    "the number of ccsn recorded in these galaxies over the past 30years is @xmath95 ( mainly based on * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for an sn rate of @xmath96yr .",
    "this implies that the rate of @xmath0car - like events is a fraction @xmath9 ( @xmath10 at 90% confidence ) of the ccsne rate .",
    "if there is only one eruption mechanism and the slsn - ii are due to ccsn occurring inside these dense shells , then the ratio of the rate of @xmath0 car - like events and slsn - ii , @xmath97 , is the ratio of the time period @xmath98 during which the shell is close enough to the star to cause a slsn to the time period @xmath99 over which shell ejections occur . with @xmath100 of the core - collapse rate @xcite , we must have that @xmath101 .",
    "a typical estimate is that @xmath102 to @xmath103 years , which implies @xmath104 to @xmath105  years , consistent with the properties of the massive shells around luminous stars observed in our own galaxy and suggesting that the instabilities driving the eruptions are linked to the onset of carbon burning @xcite . this would also imply the existence of `` superluminous '' x - ray ccsn , where an older shell of material is too distant and low density to thermalize the shock heated material but is still dense enough for the cooling time to be faster than the expansion time .",
    "such events should be @xmath106 times more common than optical slsn - ii . if the eruptions driving slsn - ii are only associated with later and shorter burning phases  ( e.g. , as in * ? ? ? * ) then there must be two eruption mechanisms and the vast majority of @xmath0car analogs will not be associated with the slsn - ii mechanism .",
    "we identified the @xmath107 potential @xmath0car analogs by specifically focusing on finding sources that most closely resemble the sed of present day @xmath0car .",
    "the reason that the seds of these five sources are so remarkably similar to each other is by design .",
    "we have not closely studied the less luminous mid - ir sources that may belong to the class of candidate self - obscured stars we identified in  @xcite , and some of the sources that we excluded because they have relatively bright optical counterparts may be evolved high mass stars with older , lower optical - depth shells .",
    "it is readily apparent that a closer scrutiny of our mid - ir catalogs should reveal richer and more diverse populations of evolved massive stars .",
    "this in turn will let us better quantify the abundance of those stars , and constrain the rates of mass ejection episodes and mass loss from massive stars prior to their death by core - collapse .",
    "the @xmath0car analog candidates we identified can be studied at greater detail with the james webb space telescope ( jwst , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , taking advantage of its order - of - magnitude - higher spatial resolution .",
    "these sources are luminous in the @xmath39 wavelength range where the jwst will be most sensitive .",
    "they are rare laboratories for stellar astrophysics and will be very interesting extragalactic stellar targets for spectroscopic study with jwst s mid - ir instrument  ( miri , * ? ? ?",
    "this will give us an unprecedented view of these most - massive self - obscured stars , letting us study their evolutionary state and the composition of their circumstellar ejecta .",
