    "one of the most important features of @xmath18 gauge theories at finite temperature is the existence of a deconfinement phase transition",
    ". the essential features of the transition have been well established by lattice simulations @xcite . below the deconfinement temperature @xmath19 ,",
    "the pressure is essentially zero , because glueball masses are large compared to @xmath19 . above @xmath19 , the pressure rises , appearing to slowly approach the blackbody result for a free gas of gauge bosons .    within the euclidean finite temperature formalism",
    ", the deconfinement transition can be viewed as the spontaneous breaking of a global symmetry associated with the center @xmath20of the gauge group @xmath18 @xcite . in this formalism",
    ", the temporal direction is periodic , with period @xmath21 .",
    "the polyakov loop , defined as the euclidean time - ordered exponential @xmath22\\ ] ] is the natural order parameter for the deconfinement transition .",
    "we will regard @xmath23as an abstract element of the group @xmath18 , and use @xmath24 to denote its trace in the representation @xmath25 .",
    "below the deconfinement transition temperature @xmath19 , in the confining phase , the @xmath26 symmetry is unbroken , which in turn implies that the thermal average of the fundamental representation trace vanishes , @xmath27 . above @xmath19 , the @xmath26 symmetry is spontaneously broken , and @xmath28 .",
    "calculation of the effective potential for @xmath29 in perturbation theory indicates that the @xmath26 symmetry is broken at high temperature , but gives no information about its restoration at low temperature @xcite .",
    "a constant chromomagnetic field is the simplest non - trivial field configuration for which the one - loop functional determinant can be evaluated analytically .",
    "this is essentially the saviddy model @xcite .",
    "the savvidy model is an interesting laboratory for perturbative calculations in non - abelian gauge theories .",
    "the essential feature of this model is the perturbative prediction that the vacuum of a non - abelian gauge theory has a chromomagnetic condensate .",
    "as pointed out by savvidy , this behavior can be inferred from asymptotic freedom .",
    "a direct path to this result is a calculation of the zero - temperature effective potential @xmath30 for constant non - abelian magnetic fields , which shows a non - trivial minimum .",
    "however , as first discussed by nielsen and olesen @xcite , the zero - temperature effective potential has a tachyonic instability , _ i.e. _ , an instability with respect to long wavelength fluctuations .",
    "this gives @xmath31a negative imaginary component , indicating that a constant field must decay towards the true vacuum state , which is unknown .",
    "nevertheless , the non - trivial minimum of @xmath32 at @xmath33 is often regarded as evidence for the dynamic breaking of scale invariance in gauge theories , and for the existence of a gauge field condensate .",
    "the savvidy model at finite temperature allows us to examine the coupling of the polyakov loop to a gauge field condensate .",
    "lattice results indicate that the expectation values of other key observables are coupled to the polyakov loop .",
    "for example , at the deconfinement transition in pure @xmath34 gauge theory , which is first order , both the polyakov loop and the plaquette expectation values are discontinuous .",
    "in fact , the plaquette expectation values are related to the internal energy density and pressure via the trace anomaly , and thus must jump at a first order transition .",
    "a simple strong coupling expansion reveals that plaquette expectation values depend on polyakov loops via topologically nontrivial strong coupling diagrams that wind around the lattice in the euclidean time direction .",
    "a similar behavior is seen for the chiral condensate @xcite thus we expect to find that the field @xmath3 couples to the polyakov loop in the savvidy model .",
    "we calculate the effective potential at all temperatures , including the effect of a non - trivial polyakov loop as well as a constant non - abelian magnetic field . from this effective potential",
    ", we find that the savvidy model distinguishes between low - temperature behavior and high - temperature behavior in a novel manner , at low temperatures , the saviddy model exhibits an intriguing oscillation between confined and deconfined phases as the temperature is varied .",
    "we regard this as important , because understanding the mechanism which determines @xmath35 as @xmath1 is varied in the full theory is tantamount to understanding the deconfinement transition , and very likely the origin of confinement .",
    "the high - temperature behavior of the savvidy model is similar to that of a free gas of gauge bosons , with a trivial polyakov loop .",
    "previous work on the savvidy model at high temperatures with a trivial polyakov loop has shown that the tachyonic instability found at zero temperature persists at high temperatures @xcite .",
    "this is potentially much more serious than instability at zero or low temperatures , because asymptotic freedom is generally taken to imply the utility of perturbative calculations in high - temperature gauge theories .",
    "the persistence of the tachyonic instability at high temperature is a barrier to the use of perturbation theory in this regime .",
    "remarkably , a non - trivial polyakov loop can counteract the tachyon instability at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "we will explore this mechanism in detail in what follows .",
    "however , the basic point is simple : a nontrivial polyakov loop acts as an additional positive mass term for gauge field fluctuations , and removes the tachyonic instability in some circumstances .",
    "ultimately this approach fails : at one loop , the imaginary part of the effective potential is non - zero at the global minimum of @xmath32 for all temperatures .",
    "an attractive possibility for high temperatures is that a non - perturbative magnetic mass stabilizes the model at one loop . as we will demonstrate below",
    ", a sufficiently large magnetic mass will not only remove the tachyonic stability , but also leads to a straightforward characterization of the high - temperature behavior with @xmath16 as the global minimum of @xmath32 .    in the process of performing the evaluation of the effective potential ,",
    "we have collected many elementary methods for doing one loop finite temperature calculations .",
    "many of these are well known .",
    "however , we have largely avoided the use of hypergeometric functions @xcite and finite temperature zeta - function techniques @xcite , which are powerful but somewhat opaque .",
    "the alternative high temperature techniques we use may be of interest , independent of the particular features of the savvidy model , especially since they are widely applicable , and retain the periodic properties associated with the polyakov loop @xcite . at appropriate points , we also stress the physical interpretation of key results , including high-@xmath36and low-@xmath1 expansions .",
    "the next section develops the formalism required for the evaluation of the one loop effective potential .",
    "section iii provides the details of the low temperature expansion , expanding on the results of @xcite .",
    "a high temperature expansion is derived in section iv , and section v examines these results in the context of dimensional reduction .",
    "section vi considers the stability of @xmath37states at high temperatures . in section vii",
    "we present our conclusions .",
    "there are three technical appendices .",
    "in this section , we introduce the formalism necessary for the evaluation of the one - loop effective potential for @xmath0 gauge bosons at finite temperature .",
    "this is accomplished by calculating the partition function in background gauge , with the background field providing both a constant non - abelian magnetic field and a non - trivial polyakov loop . in order to carry out the calculation",
    ", we choose the color magnetic field and the polyakov loop to be simultaneously diagonal .",
    "we take the color magnetic field @xmath3 to point in the @xmath38 direction .",
    "the external vector potential can be chosen to be    @xmath39    which gives rise to a chromomagnetic field @xmath40 the polyakov loop is specified by a constant @xmath41 field , given in the fundamental representation by @xmath42 where the range of @xmath2 can be taken as @xmath43 .",
    "the trace of the polyakov loop is given by @xmath44 in the fundamental representation and by @xmath45 in the adjoint representation .",
    "in general , the @xmath46 eigenvalues of the @xmath18 polyakov loop are not determined by the fundamental representation trace @xcite . however , for @xmath0 and @xmath34 , the trace of the polyakov loop in the fundamental representation does determine the eigenvalues .",
    "in the case of @xmath0 , the global @xmath47 symmetry takes @xmath48 into @xmath49 .",
