    "interactions between elementary particles are known to be responsible for the formation of bound states of matter . in particle physics ,",
    "the most celebrated examples are baryons and mesons stemming from the strong interaction between quarks mediated by gluons .",
    "bound states often have features very different from those of their constituents .",
    "for instance , cooper pairs that originate from the interaction between electrons and phonons in solids give rise to superconductivity whose existence is due to the bosonic nature of these quasiparticles . understanding formation mechanisms of bound states as well as their properties is thus of primary interest especially when the building blocks are exotic excitations which are neither bosons nor fermions .",
    "such objects , known as anyons  @xcite , have drawn much attention because of their potential use for topological quantum computation @xcite .",
    "although anyons have not yet been unambiguously detected in experiments , the most promising candidates are fractional quantum hall states  @xcite .",
    "the concept of anyon is intimately related to the notion of topological quantum order whose description requires us to go beyond the landau symmetry - breaking theory ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "recently , substantial progress has been made to classify topological phases , especially for @xmath0-dimensional systems  @xcite but a systematic way to microscopically engineer them is still lacking .",
    "a major step in this direction has been taken by levin and wen  @xcite through the so - called string - net model that gives access to a broad class of topological phases  @xcite .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to study the formation of bound states induced by the introduction of a string tension in the string - net model .",
    "a string tension is known to break the topological phase when it is sufficiently large as already discussed in several cases  @xcite . here , we focus on the quasiparticle spectrum in the topological phase and we show that , in most cases , bound states are the low - energy excitations . we compute the binding energy in the weak - tension limit for any anyon theory in the two - rung ladder and in the honeycomb lattice . in the latter case ,",
    "we find that the number of bound states depends on the total quantum dimension .",
    "finally , we investigate the internal structure , i.e. , the particle content of these bound states . in the one - dimensional case ,",
    "we find that the contribution of each anyon type to the bound states is always proportional to their quantum dimension whereas this symmetry does not hold for large tension in the two - dimensional case .",
    "in the string - net model introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , microscopic degrees of freedom are defined on the links of a trivalent graph and can be in @xmath1 different states where @xmath1 is given by the input theory of interest . mathematically , this input theory is described by a unitary modular tensor category which , at this stage , can be roughly considered as a set of objects obeying a set of rules ( see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "the hilbert space of the string - net model is spanned by all link configurations satisfying the so - called branching rules at each vertices .",
    "these branching rules stem from the fusion rules of the input theory : at a given trivalent vertex , if two links are in the state @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the third one must be in a state @xmath4 that belongs to the fusion product @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    ". violations of these branching rules correspond to charge excitations that are not considered here .",
    "the hamiltonian of the string - net model is given by a sum of local commuting projectors acting on plaquettes @xmath5 the explicit action of @xmath6 on a link configuration is given in ref .",
    "@xcite . by definition",
    ", we call an eigenstate of @xmath6 with eigenvalue @xmath7 @xmath8 a state without ( with ) a flux in the plaquette @xmath9 .",
    "the ground - state manifold of @xmath10 is thus spanned by all states without flux in plaquettes . the dimension @xmath11 of this manifold , also known as the topological degeneracy , depends on the system . on a compact surface of genus",
    "@xmath12 , @xmath13 whereas @xmath14 for a ladder with periodic boundary conditions .    by acting with a local operator on any ground state , excitations can only be created by pairs",
    ", one may generate single - flux excitations by using nonlocal operators . ]",
    "the degeneracy @xmath15 of the excited states with @xmath16 fluxes depends both on the surface topology and on the fusion rules of the theory considered ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for various examples ) .",
    "the corresponding excitation energy @xmath17 does not depend on the position of the fluxes ( deconfined phase ) .",
    "the main focus of this work is to analyze the excitation spectrum in the presence of a perturbation that lifts this degeneracy and effectively provides quantum dynamics to fluxes . to this aim ,",
    "let us consider the operator @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a projector which is diagonal in the link basis .",
    "if a link @xmath20 is in a state @xmath2 then @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the trivial state .",
    "the perturbation @xmath23 is local and it does not commute with @xmath10 . in the eigenbasis of @xmath10 ( flux basis ) , @xmath19 acts effectively as a creation / destruction operator but also as an interaction / transmutation term between fluxes . from that respect",
    ", @xmath23 plays the role of a string tension that eventually induces a transition towards a confined phase  @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we consider the hamiltonian and , for simplicity , we restrict our discussion to the . for the @xmath24 theory ,",
    "this model can be mapped onto the transverse - field potts model where fluxes are microscopic degrees of .",
    "since @xmath23 is a sum of local terms , it does not perturbatively change the flux through noncontractible loops that may exist for some surface topologies .",
    "this property which is the source of the so - called topological protection allows one to study each topological sector separately .",
    "below , we focus on the trivial sector in which elementary excitations for @xmath25 are all possible pairs of fluxes @xmath26 fusing to the vacuum ( @xmath27 denotes the dual of @xmath2 ) . for @xmath28 , excitations can be seen as quasiparticles ( qps ) corresponding to  dressed fluxes \" in the usual fermi liquid picture .",
    "let us start our analysis by considering the string - net model defined on the two - leg ladder . as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , the string - net ladder in the presence of the perturbation @xmath23 undergoes a quantum phase transition at the self - dual point @xmath29 . at this point",
    ", the model can be exactly mapped onto the @xmath30 chain with an anisotropy parameter @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the total quantum dimension of the theory .",
    "this problem is also equivalent to the potts model with @xmath33 .",
    "consequently , if @xmath34 the self - dual point is a critical point  @xcite whereas for @xmath35 it corresponds to a first - order transition point  @xcite .    at order 1 in perturbation , in the limit @xmath28 , one can exactly compute the 2qp spectrum for any theory .",
    "therefore , one has to compute the matrix elements of @xmath23 in the 2qp subspace . in the trivial sector , let us denote @xmath36 the unique state with a flux @xmath2 ( @xmath27 ) in the plaquette .",
    "if @xmath37 and @xmath38 are not adjacent , @xmath23 can not change the flavor of the fluxes and acts as a single - flux hopping term .",
    "indeed , one has @xmath39 where @xmath40 if @xmath41 and @xmath42 are adjacent plaquettes and 0 otherwise , @xmath43 is the total number of links , and @xmath44 is the usual kronecker symbol . by contrast , if @xmath37 and @xmath38 are adjacent , @xmath23 acts as an interaction term that may also transmute a pair @xmath26 into a pair @xmath45 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath46 where the sum runs over all nontrivial fluxes @xmath4 that belong to the fusion product @xmath47 , and @xmath48 denotes the quantum dimension of the flux @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , for any ground state @xmath49 of @xmath10 , one has @xmath50 .",
    "theory  @xcite on a ladder with seven plaquettes and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the scattering - states continuum ( green ) and the bound - state continuum ( blue ) computed perturbatively at order 1 for @xmath28 are compared with exact diagonalization ( ed ) results . ]    in the thermodynamical limit , one can analytically diagonalize @xmath23 in the 2qp subspace . for any @xmath32 ,",
    "the 2qp excitation spectrum consists of a continuum of scattering states . as can be straightforwardly derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq : v_hopping ] ) , the boundaries of this continuum are given by    @xmath51    more interestingly , when the total quantum dimension @xmath35 , one finds a continuum associated to a low - energy bound state whose boundaries are given by @xmath52 figure [ fig : bound_states ] displays a comparison between these results valid in the thermodynamical limit and exact diagonalization data obtained for the theory @xmath53 for which @xmath54 .    for @xmath55 ,",
    "there is no bound state in the spectrum at order 1 and one thus needs to investigate higher - order perturbation theory .",
    "indeed , the operator @xmath23 is similar to the one considered in refs .",
    "@xcite to perturb the critical @xmath56-state potts model . keeping in mind that our model corresponds to the case @xmath33 , we know that in the vicinity of @xmath29 , bound states arise for  @xcite .",
    "this concerns two sets of modular theories : the fibonacci theory for which @xmath57 ( where is the golden mean ) and all theories with @xmath58 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "however , let us remind that our perturbative analysis is performed in the vicinity of @xmath25 and one may wonder whether fingerprints of the bound states present near @xmath29 can be observed .     as a function of @xmath59 for the fibonacci theory , measured in units of the distance between adjacent plaquettes .",
    "inset : probability density of the ( translation - invariant ) lowest - energy bound state as a function of the distance between the two fluxes . for @xmath60 , at order 10 , the binding energy is @xmath61 , @xmath62 is maximum for @xmath63 and @xmath64 . ]    to address this issue , we computed the 2qp spectrum up to order 10 in the limit @xmath28 . for all @xmath58 theories",
    ", we found one bound state in the whole range @xmath65 $ ] , but the binding energy is of order 3 contrary to the case @xmath35 where it is of order 1 [ see eqs .",
    "( [ eq:2-qp_cont_gap_1d])([eq:2-qpgap_1d_2 ] ) ] . more precisely , for @xmath58 , one gets @xmath66 this bound state identifies with the state predicted in the perturbed four - state critical potts model but the present perturbative approach for",
    "@xmath67 does not allow us to recover the exact critical mass ratio which for @xmath58 is given by  @xcite .    for the fibonacci theory",
    ", we also find one bound state but only in the range . indeed ,",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : localization ] , the localization length of the bound state diverges at and , for smaller values of @xmath59 , low - energy excited states are scattering states . here again , we do not recover the exact critical mass ratio which , for , is given by  @xcite .     as a function of total quantum dimension for the ladder ( black ) and for the honeycomb lattice ( red ) .",
    "in the latter case , two additional bound states emerge for @xmath68 . for both geometries ,",
    "one further has : @xmath69 . ]    for completeness , let us mention that we did not find any 2qp bound state in the ladder for @xmath70 , i.e. , for semion ( @xmath71 ) and @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) theories , in agreement with results from refs .",
    "let us now consider the honeycomb lattice which is the simplest trivalent two - dimensional system .",
    "contrary to the one - dimensional case , we can not provide an explicit form of the binding energy , even at order 1 .",
    "thus , results given thereafter have been obtained by numerically diagonalizing the effective 2qp hamiltonian whose matrix elements have been computed perturbatively in the limit @xmath28 for each theory of interest .",
    "the maximum relative distance between particles considered here is @xmath74 ( in units of the distance between adjacent plaquettes ) .    at order 1 ,",
    "matrix elements of @xmath23 in the 2qp subspace are still given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : v_hopping ] ) and ( [ eq : v_interaction ] ) but plaquettes now form a triangular lattice . at this order ,",
    "the spectrum only depends on @xmath32 and three cases must be distinguished : +   + @xmath75 @xmath34 : no low - energy bound state ; + @xmath75 @xmath76 : one low - energy bound state ; + @xmath75 @xmath77 : three low - energy bound states among which two have the same binding energy .",
    "+    the corresponding binding energies are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : binding ] .    at higher orders",
    ", the situation is different . indeed , at order 2 and beyond",
    ", we also find one bound state for all theories with @xmath34 except for semions ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "this bound state emerges for a finite string tension @xmath79 that depends on the theory .",
    "unfortunately , in two dimensions , we can not reach sufficiently high orders to obtain accurate values of @xmath79 .",
    "let us simply mention that for the ising theory , one gets @xmath80 at order 2 ( instead of @xmath81 in the ladder ) .    in the absence of bound states ,",
    "scattering states are the relevant low - energy excitations and their condensation generates a continuous transition .",
    "such a scenario occurs for the semion theory where a second - order transition is expected . to obtain a first - order transition , bound states",
    "are thus required in the low - energy spectrum as exemplified in the @xmath72 theory where such a transition occurs . however , although necessary , we emphasize that the existence of bound states is not a sufficient condition to have a first - order transition as we have seen in the ladder for .",
    "for theories with @xmath82 , an important issue concerns the particle content of the bound states . at order 1 , in the limit @xmath83 ,",
    "the 2qp spectrum is obtained by diagonalizing @xmath23 in the 2qp subspace .",
    "the corresponding matrix elements given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : v_hopping ] ) and ( [ eq : v_interaction ] ) unveil a remarkable property of the eigenstates at this order .",
    "indeed , the hopping term does not depend on the particle type and the interaction term simply depends on the fusion rules .",
    "consequently , one can show that for any bound state @xmath84 in the trivial flux sector one has : @xmath85 in other words , at order 1 , bound states of @xmath86 are a superposition of all particle types with a weight proportional to the quantum dimension of the particles .",
    "in addition , in the ladder , we found that this structure is robust for all theories and all orders we studied .",
    "we thus conjecture that it results from a symmetry that we have not been able to evidence non perturbatively .",
    "however , in the honeycomb lattice , eq .  ( [ eq : ratio ] ) only holds up to . at higher orders ,",
    "nontrivial braiding between virtual states occur in the perturbation theory , single - flux hopping terms depends on the particle type , and the particle content depends on the order .",
    "in this study , we have shown that a string tension could generate 2qp bound states in the string - net model .",
    "these bound states are bosonic since they are found in the trivial flux sector .",
    "however , we also found anyonic 2qp bound states in other flux sectors but their analysis is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "finally , we emphasize that these bound states are the relevant low - energy excitations of the system that would be directly observed in spectral densities for @xmath28 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a similar case in the toric code model in the presence of a magnetic field ) .",
    "we have argued that bound states have to be present in the excitation spectrum to build up a ( nontrivial ) first - order phase transition . in this case , when @xmath59 increases , a cascade of level crossings associated to @xmath87qp ( @xmath88 ) bound states is expected . however , as early realized in the ising chain in a magnetic field , bound states may also be observed near critical points  @xcite .",
    "a deeper understanding of the role played by the bound states in quantum phase transitions is clearly needed and we hope that the present work will stimulate further studies in this direction .",
