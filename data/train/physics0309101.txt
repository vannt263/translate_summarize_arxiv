    "the discovery of c@xmath6 buckminsterfullerene  @xcite , observation of magicity in metallic clusters  @xcite , unusual thermodynamical properties of clusters of atoms like na  @xcite , sn  @xcite etc . , has given rise to an explosive growth of research in the field of cluster physics .",
    "extensive theoretical and experimental  @xcite work has been carried out to understand the physical and chemical properties of clusters like size - evolutionary pattern in cluster geometry , thermodynamics , vibrational and rotational properties , optical properties , electronic structure , and bonding , chemical reactivity , as well as the emergence of the bulk properties with the increase in cluster size .",
    "recently observed aromaticity  @xcite and antiaromaticity  @xcite in inorganic molecules , and in particular al - li clusters , has stimulated further research in these systems .",
    "these properties are well - known and important in organic chemistry  @xcite . however , recently the first experimental and theoretical evidence of aromaticity in all - metal system viz . al@xmath7 and @xmath8al@xmath9 ( @xmath8 = li , na , cu ) was reported by wang and coworkers  @xcite .",
    "they found the al@xmath7 dianion to be square - planar possessing two @xmath10-electrons , thus conforming the structural criterion for aromaticity .",
    "the concept of antiaromaticity , introduced by breslow  @xcite .",
    ", corresponds to the destabilization seen in the cyclic systems with @xmath11-electrons .",
    "although such molecules have not yet been observed except in organic chemistry , calculations reported by shetty  @xcite . and",
    "others  @xcite indicate the  cluster to be antiaromatic .",
    "aluminum - lithium clusters , which we study in this paper , are also interesting due to their unusual structural and bonding properties that are quite different from those of the pure clusters of the constituent elements .",
    "both pure al and li clusters have been extensively studied using the spherical jellium model ( sjm )  @xcite .",
    "however , it is observed that although the sjm has been quite successful in describing the gross electronic structure and the stability of alkali metal atom clusters  @xcite , the al clusters present an interesting contrast . rao and jena  @xcite have reported a comprehensive study of the aluminum cluster using _ ab initio _ density functional theory .",
    "they found that in small al clusters , the effective valency of al is one  @xcite due to a large energy gap of about 5ev separating the @xmath12 and @xmath13 orbitals .",
    "however , rao  @xcite . as well as dhavale  @xcite .",
    "did not find any signature of such monovalent behavior , contrary to the expectations .",
    "investigation by cheng  @xcite . shows that a single al atom in li clusters introduces a localized bond between the al impurity and the li host .",
    "they also found a magic cluster alli@xmath14 , and suggested that al@xmath15li@xmath16 can aggregate at least for some values of @xmath17 and may exhibit properties characteristic to an assembly of such clusters from the alli@xmath14 subunits .",
    "akola  @xcite .",
    ", however , found that this idea does not apply after @xmath18 .",
    "further , their investigation on bonding in li - rich al - li clusters show a substantial charge transfer from li atom and nearby al atom , strengthening the ionic al - li bond , while the al - al bond gained a more covalent nature .",
    "such a charge transfer has been observed by kumar  @xcite in several mixed al - li clusters .",
    "he found a layered al@xmath19li@xmath20 compound to be magic with electronic and geometric shell closing .",
    "this was the first instance where a shell closure in @xmath21 bonded metal cluster was found to occur at 38 valence electrons .",
    "note that the magic numbers for alkali metal atom clusters  @xcite are 2 , 8 , 18 , 20 , 40 , ... , whereas , some of the magic al clusters are al@xmath22 , al@xmath23 , al@xmath24 , al@xmath25 , etc  @xcite .",
    "the al - li bulk is especially interesting due to the fact that it forms a stable alloy at over the wide range of concentration .",
    "however , the most stable intermetallic b32 phase corresponds to the 50:50 concentration  @xcite . in this b32 phase",
    ", a mixture of covalent and ionic bonding is seen due to a remarkable charge transfer from the li atoms to the al atoms .",
    "moreover , the close resemblance of the density of states ( dos ) ( without any band gap )  @xcite to that of the covalently bonded diamond structure indicates a tetravalent behavior of al atom .",
    "thus , based on these observations , one can expect that the behavior of al in  clusters would be similar to that of the tetravalent atom si  @xcite , ge  @xcite , sn , and pb  @xcite .",
    "indeed , our present work shows that in certain clusters , structure and bonding of al@xmath15 is similar to that of the group iv  a clusters .",
    "moreover , earlier work on the heterogeneous al - li clusters has focussed on specific aspects like systematics in the geometry , stability , shell closure , magic behavior etc .",
    "bonding in such clusters was discussed on the basis of total charge density as well as the difference of the self - consistent charge density , @xmath26 , and the superimposed atomic charge densities @xmath27 of the constituent atoms . on the contrary ,",
    "analysis of the molecular orbitals ( mos ) has revealed some unusual properties like aromaticity and antiaromaticity in all - metal al - li clusters . in our earlier work , we have examined some of the issues concerning the geometry and the stability of various al - li clusters viz .",

    ", we have interchanged the al and the li atoms .",

    "various low - lying structures were obtained by conjugate gradient and/or steepest descent  @xcite method starting from various suitable configurations during the molecular dynamics run .",

    "the structures were considered to have converged when the forces on each ion was less than 0.01ev /   with a convergence in the total energy within the range of @xmath41ev . in general",
    ", we find that there are many isomeric structures nearly degenerate to the lowest energy state .",
    "few of the structures can be obtained by interchanging the al and the li atoms or by rearranging the position of li atoms . in the present work ,",
    "we discuss only a few geometries corresponding to the lowest energies .",
    "the nature of the bonding has been investigated using the electron localization function ( elf )  @xcite along with the molecular orbitals ( mo ) as well as the difference charge density .",
    "the elfs have been found to be useful for elucidating the bonding characteristics of a variety of systems , especially in conjunction with the charge density .",
    "the value of the elf lies between 0 and 1 , where 1 represents a perfect localization of the valence charge density .",

    "interestingly , the planar  structure , with some bending , has been observed by kumar  @xcite in the magic cluster al@xmath19li@xmath20 .",
    "however , because of his restricted nature of search , he did not find this 8 valence electron system to have particular stability .",
