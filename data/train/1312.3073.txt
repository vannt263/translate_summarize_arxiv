    "network forming materials are ubiquitous in nature , common examples being semiconductors such as silicon and silica , as well as fluids that can form hydrogen bonds .",
    "what these materials have in common is that their topology on short length scales is governed by certain rules .",
    "for example , in amorphous silicon , most atoms are 4-fold coordinated , the preferred si - si bond length being @xmath0   , and the preferred si - si - si bond angle being the tetrahedral angle .",
    "this complicates molecular dynamics simulations of these materials , where the particles spend most of their time thermally fluctuating about their equilibrium positions , while large structural changes in the network topology are rare .",
    "this is particularly cumbersome if well - relaxed amorphous networks are needed , i.e.  networks that locally fulfill the bond requirements ( and thus have a low energy ) but where long - ranged order is absent .     the bond - switch monte carlo move of the www algorithm . ]    to overcome this problem , wooten , winer , and weaire ( www ) proposed a monte carlo algorithm using a bond - switch move  @xcite .",
    "this move can be applied to any system whose potential energy @xmath1 is defined via a connectivity table , i.e.  an explicit list specifying which particles are connected to each other by bonds ( the prototype example of such a potential is the keating potential  @xcite , see also eq .",
    "( [ eq : keating ] ) ) .",
    "the bond - switch move proceeds as shown in fig .",
    "first , a cluster @xmath2 of four particles is selected randomly , containing the bonds @xmath3 with the constraint that @xmath4 may not be bonded to @xmath5 , nor @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "next , a change in the network topology is proposed , whereby the bonds @xmath8 and @xmath9 are removed from the connectivity table , and replaced by two new bonds , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the change is accepted with the metropolis probability @xmath12,\\ ] ] with @xmath13 the energy before ( after ) the bond - switch , @xmath14 the temperature , and @xmath15 the boltzmann constant .",
    "the prime ( @xmath16 ) indicates , and this point is crucial , that the energy is to be measured with all the particles in the network placed at their equilibrium positions .",
    "that is , for a given network topology ( connectivity table ) the particle positions are fixed deterministically by energy minimization .",
    "the www algorithm is thus primarily aimed at modifying the network topology , while thermal fluctuations of the particles about their equilibrium positions are ignored ( note the contrast with molecular dynamics ) .",
    "unfortunately , it does so at a cost : by deterministically fixing the particle positions at every move ergodicity is broken .",
    "hence , the www algorithm does _ not _ sample the boltzmann distribution at finite @xmath14 . in its",
    "original formulation  @xcite this issue was irrelevant , since there the goal was simply to generate a well - relaxed ( low energy ) amorphous network ( the algorithm thus being merely an optimization tool ) .",
    "however , if one wishes to study temperature - driven phase transitions in these systems , then the original www algorithm needs to be modified .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present such a modification , and to use it to study the melting transition of a two - dimensional 3-fold coordinated network .",
    "to be specific , we consider a two - dimensional @xmath17 system with periodic boundaries containing @xmath18 particles .",
    "to each particle @xmath19 , a vector @xmath20 is assigned to denote its position in the plane , as well as three integers @xmath21 which denote the labels of the three particles to which particle @xmath19 is bonded .",
    "the energy is given by the keating potential  @xcite @xmath22 } \\left ( \\vec{r}_{ij } \\cdot \\vec{r}_{ij } -d^2 \\right)^2    \\hspace{2 cm } \\\\",

    "the first term is a two - body interaction which equates the preferred @xmath28 bond length to @xmath29 ; the second term is a three - body interaction which sets the preferred @xmath30 bond angle to 120 degrees ( as appropriate for a two - dimensional system ) .",
    "the sums in eq .",
    "( [ eq : keating ] ) extend over bonded particles in the connectivity table only . for a system containing @xmath31 particles ,",
    "there are @xmath32 two - body terms , and @xmath33 three - body terms .",
    "the computational effort of the energy calculation thus scales linearly with @xmath31 .      in what follows ,",
    "the @xmath34-ensemble is used at density @xmath35 , box aspect ratio @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , with @xmath38 an integer . in this way , the box always `` fits '' the groundstate of eq .",
    "( [ eq : keating ] ) , i.e.  a perfect honeycomb lattice with lattice constant @xmath29 ( the corresponding energy thus being @xmath39 ) .",
    "all reported temperatures are given in units of @xmath40 , while free energies ( and free energy differences ) are reported in units of @xmath41 .",
    "consider now a network configuration ( i.e.  a set of particle positions and a connectivity table ) in which a cluster of four particles @xmath42 has been selected according to the www bond - switch move of fig .",
    "let @xmath43 denote the initial positions of these four particles .",
    "next , perform a local energy minimization , whereby only the positions of the four particles in the cluster are allowed to change , keeping the positions of all the other particles in the network , as well as the connectivity table , fixed .",
    "the resulting positions are denoted @xmath44 .",
    "the modification of the www algorithm is based on the observation that , irrespective of the initial positions @xmath43 , the positions @xmath44 obtained after local energy minimization are always the same .",
    "this property can be exploited to modify the bond - switch such that both detailed balance and ergodicity are obeyed : the cluster @xmath45 is selected as before ; the initial positions @xmath43 , and the positions @xmath44 obtained after local energy minimization , are recorded .",
    "next , one performs the bond - switch , immediately followed by a second local energy minimization where , as before , only the particles in the cluster are allowed to move ; the resulting positions @xmath46 are recorded .",
    "finally , a stochastic process is used to generate four random displacements @xmath47 around @xmath46 , which yield the final positions of the four particles : @xmath48 .",

    ", @xmath50 is the probability that the stochastic process ( still to be specified ) selects the vector @xmath51 .",

    "( [ eq : www ] ) , the energies @xmath52 and @xmath53 refer to the actual network energy ( and not the energy obtained after minimization with respect to the particle positions ) .",
    "provided the selection process used to generate the displacements @xmath54 is ergodic , this algorithm faithfully samples the boltzmann distribution at temperature @xmath14 .",
    "its efficiency is set by the details of the selection process . with the particles placed at their locally minimized positions @xmath55",
    "the energy can be approximated as  @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the second derivative of @xmath1 with respect to @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( to be evaluated at the minimized positions ) . since eq .",
    "( [ eq : taylor ] ) is quadratic in the displacements , the latter are gaussian distributed in thermal equilibrium .",
    "a good choice is therefore to draw @xmath60 from the gaussian probability distribution @xmath61 with @xmath62 , and similarly for @xmath63 where @xmath64 .",
    "note that , by drawing from a gaussian distribution , every displacement has a finite probability of being selected , and so ergodicity is trivially fulfilled .",
    "since the components of @xmath47 are selected independently , it holds that @xmath65 .",
    "the computation of the reverse weight @xmath66 proceeds analogously , but with the derivatives evaluated at @xmath44 before the bonds were switched .",
    "the algorithm just described samples the network topology and the particle positions simultaneously , which suffices for a simulation .",
    "still , to facilitate faster equilibration , it helps to also use a move whereby only the particle positions are updated . to this end",

    "we observe an overall ordered structure of hexagons , containing `` bubbles '' of regions that are disordered .",
    "in contrast to the snapshot of fig .",
    "[ 5k ] , however , these bubbles do not coalesce . hence , the ordered phase is to be regarded as an ordered array of hexagons , but with a finite concentration of defect regions .",
    "the latter reflect thermal fluctuations , that appear at random locations in the network .",
    "as the temperature is lowered further , these defects are gradually frozen out , until , at @xmath120 , the perfect honeycomb lattice is reached .",
    "in summary , we have proposed an extension of the bond - switch monte carlo move of wooten , winer , and weaire  @xcite , in order to correctly simulate network forming materials at finite temperature .",
    "the algorithm can be applied to systems whose potential energy is defined via a connectivity table , such as the keating potential  @xcite ( used in this work ) , or the tu - tersoff potential for silica  @xcite .",
    "a second requirement is that , for a given connectivity table , a local energy minimization performed on a small cluster of particles always yields the same positions for these particles . when these conditions are met , network configurations that faithfully sample the boltzmann distribution are readily generated .",
    "this paves the way toward the first high - resolution simulations of these materials , since all the tools developed for the numerical study of phase transitions ( finite - size scaling , transition matrix sampling , biased sampling , histogram reweighing , and so forth ) can now be applied .",
    "we have illustrated the merit of this approach by performing a detailed analysis of the melting transition in a two - dimensional 3-fold coordinated keating network , which was shown to be first - order .    as a future application ,",
    "an investigation of a silica network , which is a glass former , seems particularly fruitful .",
    "there are indications  @xcite that the dominant mechanism in structural relaxation in these materials is , in fact , the bond - switch move of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in a molecular dynamics simulation , where the natural time scale is phonon - based , such bond - switches are rare events . in the present algorithm ,",
    "the natural time scale is event - based , and so it should be easier to probe the long - time relaxation regime .",
    "we note that ref .",
    "@xcite also identified two other relaxation mechanisms , in addition to the bond - switch move of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . whether these can also be exploited as finite - temperature monte carlo moves remains to be investigated .",

    "<S> lett .  * 54 * , 1392 ( 1985 ) ] proposed a monte carlo bond - switch move , constructed to alter the network topology at every step . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting algorithm is well suited to study networks at zero temperature . </S>",
    "<S> however , since thermal fluctuations are ignored , it can not be used to probe the phase behavior at finite temperature . in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> a modification of the original bond - switch move is proposed , in which detailed balance and ergodicity are both obeyed , thereby facilitating a correct sampling of the boltzmann distribution for these systems at any finite temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the merits of the modified algorithm are demonstrated in a detailed investigation of the melting transition in a two - dimensional 3-fold coordinated network . </S>"
