    "precision spectroscopy of antiprotonic helium is among the most spectacular examples of a successful fusion of particle accelerator with low energy atomic physics methods for the study of the fundamental characteristics of an elementary particle - the antiproton ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein . ) among the main goals of the experimental program of the cern collaborations ps205 and asacusa are precision tests of bound - states qed , the determination of the dipole magnetic moment of the antiproton , and independent tests of cpt invariance",
    ". strong limits of * @xmath2 * on the possible differences between proton and antiproton masses and electric charges have already been extracted from the experimental results @xcite .",
    "studies of qed of bound systems involving antiparticles are motivated by the unsolved problems @xcite in the theoretical evaluation of the hyperfine structure ( hfs ) of positronium @xcite , which is known not to be in perfect agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "it is believed that qed tests on systems involving heavy antiparticles may help understand these problems better , since the various qed contributions have different weights in antiprotonic helium as compared to positronium . in the present paper",
    "we focus our attention on the possibility of determining the antiproton magnetic moment ( currently known to 0.3% only from a measurement of the fine structure of antiprotonic lead @xcite ) with an improved accuracy by measuring the hyperfine splitting and comparing the spectroscopy data with the theoretical calculations of the hyperfine structure ( hfs ) of metastable states of the @xmath3he atoms @xcite .",
    "while the new value will be too much less accurate than the value of the magnetic moment of the proton @xcite for a meaningful test of cpt , it will fill a blank in the particle properties tables that has survived for more than 2 decades . in the non - relativistic approximation the bound states of @xmath3he",
    "are traditionally labelled with the quantum numbers of the total orbital momentum @xmath4 and the principal quantum number @xmath5 , though an alternative labelling with @xmath4 and the vibrational quantum number @xmath6 is also used ; of course , @xmath7 . for the near - circular excited states with @xmath4 in the range @xmath8 and small @xmath6 the auger decay is suppressed ( condo mechanism @xcite ) so that they de - excite only through slow radiative transitions .",
    "the life time of these states may reach microseconds ; they are referred to as metastable .",
    "the pairwise spin interactions between the constituents of @xmath3he split each coulomb level into hyperfine components @xcite .",
    "the hyperfine structure of the metastable state @xmath9 consists of 4 substates @xmath10 , labelled ( in addition to @xmath5 and @xmath4 ) with the quantum numbers @xmath11 and @xmath12 of the intermediate angular momentum @xmath13 and the total angular momentum @xmath14 ; here @xmath15 and @xmath16 stand for the spin operators of the electron and the antiproton .",
    "the spin interactions are dominated by the electron spin - orbit interaction causing a splitting of the order of 10 ghz of the @xmath9 level into the @xmath17 doublets with @xmath18 .",
    "the splitting within the @xmath17 doublets is due to interactions involving the antiproton spin , and is approximately two orders of magnitude smaller ( see fig.[hfs ] ) .",
    "he and of the dipole transition @xmath19 between them .",
    "the transitions between states of the @xmath20 and @xmath21 doublets are denoted by @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 depending on @xmath25 ; the transitions within the @xmath17 doublets are labelled as @xmath26 .",
    "the transitions between homologous doublets of the parent and daughter states are denoted by @xmath27 , and between the homologous components of the doublets - by @xmath28 . ]",
    "the hfs of the @xmath0 state was first observed in 1997 @xcite , when improved resolution allowed for clearly distinguishing two peaks in the profile of the @xmath29 transition line .",
    "the peaks correspond to the @xmath30 and @xmath31 transitions on fig.[hfs ] ; at that time the components @xmath28 could not be resolved , and the remaining non - diagonal components were too strongly suppressed to be observed @xcite .",
    "the first laser spectroscopy study of the hfs of the @xmath0 state was performed in 2002 @xcite ; using the triple resonance method the frequencies of the @xmath32 transitions were measured with an accuracy of the order of 300 khz ( below 30 ppm ) .",
    "the idea of the method was to depopulate the @xmath20 doublet with a laser pulse tuned at the frequency of the @xmath30 transition , then refill it from the @xmath21 doublet by applying an oscillating magnetic field tuned at the @xmath33 or @xmath34 transition frequency , and measure the refilling rate with a repeated laser pulse tuned at the @xmath30 transition frequency . in future measurements of the @xmath32 transition frequencies the experimental uncertainty is expected to be further reduced . in what follows",
    "we are analyzing the restrictions that theoretical and experimental uncertainties impose on the value of the antiproton dipole magnetic moment as extracted from spectroscopy data , and outline an alternative approach to improving the accuracy of this value , possibly by up to 2 orders of magnitude .",
    "the spin interaction hamiltonian @xmath36 , used in the calculations of the hfs of @xmath3he in @xcite , has the form of a sum of pairwise interaction terms : @xmath37 , with ( in units @xmath38 ) @xmath39 here @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , @xmath44 stand for the mass , position vector , momentum and spin operator of the @xmath45-th constituent of the @xmath3he atom , @xmath46 . _ and",
    "@xmath47 is the magnetic moment of particle @xmath45 in units of `` own magnetons '' @xmath48 , @xmath49 being the electric charge in units @xmath50 .",
    "_ in first order of perturbation theory the hyperfine energy levels @xmath51 are calculated as eigenvalues of the matrix of @xmath36 in an appropriate basis .",
    "the computational procedure makes use of the effective spin hamiltonian of the system  a finite - dimensional operator acting in the space of the spin and orbital momentum variables of the particles : @xmath52 the coefficients @xmath53 of @xmath54 are calculated by averaging the spin interaction hamiltonian @xmath36 of eqs .",
    "( [ vae])-([vpe ] ) with the non - relativistic three - body wave functions of @xmath3he ; the remaining part of the computations is reduced to angular momentum algebra .",
    "the uncertainty of @xmath36 is determined by the contribution of the interaction terms of order @xmath55 and higher , that have not been taken into consideration .",
    "accordingly , the relative uncertainty @xmath56 of the coefficients @xmath57 , due to truncating the expansion of @xmath36 in power series in @xmath58 is estimated to be of relative order @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty of @xmath57 gives rise to the uncertainties @xmath60 and @xmath61 of the hyperfine energy levels and the hyperfine transition frequencies , respectively , and to the relative uncertainties @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the latter are expressed in terms of the response of @xmath51 and @xmath64 to variations of @xmath57 around the values calculated with the spin interaction hamiltonian @xmath36 , and are given by the derivatives @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "table  [ extra ] , presenting the numerical values of these derivatives for the hyperfine levels of the @xmath0 state , shows that the theoretical accuracy for all five allowed hyperfine transitions is of the order of @xmath67 since @xmath68 does not exceed 1 and no precision is lost .",
    "we have also included in consideration the difference @xmath69 of the transition frequencies of the @xmath22 and @xmath23 transitions , @xmath70 .",
    "this combination is of interest because , on the one hand , it is quite sensitive to the value of @xmath71 , and on the other , an improvement of the precision on the @xmath33 and @xmath34 transition frequencies and therefore also on @xmath69 by at least one order of magnitude is expected in experiments using an improved laser system in the near future @xcite .",
    ".response of the hyperfine energy levels @xmath51 , of the hyperfine transition frequencies @xmath64 and of the difference @xmath69 of the @xmath33 and @xmath34 transition frequencies in the metastable state @xmath0 of the @xmath3he atom to variations of the effective spin hamiltonian coefficients @xmath57 .",
    "listed are the dimensionless derivatives @xmath72 and @xmath73 , evaluated numerically at @xmath74 , i.e. using the values calculated with the spin interaction hamiltonian @xmath36 . [ cols=\"^,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have shown that high accuracy measurements of appropriate hyperfine transition lines in the metastable states of antiprotonic helium can help reduce the experimental uncertainty of the dipole magnetic moment of the antiproton .",
    "an improvement of the current experiment measuring the @xmath23 , @xmath22 and as a consequence @xmath69 , is being prepared and it is expected to improve the accuracy on @xmath71 by up to a factor of 9 .",
    "a larger improvement by a factor of up to 40 is possible by directly measuring the antiproton spin - flip transitions @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the restrictions on the expected gain of accuracy come from the difficulty to reduce the experimental uncertainty below the threshold @xmath77 in table  [ uncert ] rather than from the limited accuracy of the breit spin interaction hamiltonian @xmath36 of eqs .",
    "( [ vae])-([vpe ] ) used in the theoretical calculations .",
    "we have also outlined a possible experimental method for the measurement of the super - hyperfine splitting , without discussing in details the feasibility of the experiment .",
    "we leave for future works the numerical simulations that will answer questions about the restrictions on the experimental accuracy from the expectedly rather low signal - to - noise ratio and about the possible use of a large oscillatory magnetic filed in cryogenic helium gas target ."
