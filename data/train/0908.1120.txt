    "by far the largest collection of globular clusters ( gcs ) within any one galaxy in the local universe is in m87 , the cd giant in the virgo cluster .",
    "its total gc population is @xmath9 @xcite , roughly a third of the gcs population in all the virgo galaxies combined ( see the virgo cluster survey results of * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , because both the foreground reddening and field contamination are low , the m87 gcs can be traced outward to extremely large projected galactocentric distance , 100 kpc or more @xcite .",
    "this combination of characteristics makes m87 a unique testbed for systematics of gc systems .",
    "a particular topic of recent interest is the correlation between gc metallicity and luminosity ( or mass ) , a trend which has been found to show up on the blue , metal - poor sequence ( * ? ? ?",

    "* and references cited there ) . in brief , the mean gc metallicity along the blue sequence is seen to increase steadily , though perhaps not linearly , with increasing cluster mass .",
    "so far , the most likely physical explanation that has been advanced for the origin of this effect is some form of self - enrichment during the protocluster epoch @xcite .",
    "the essential idea of this interpretation is that any self - enrichment should be more efficient within the more massive , deeper potential wells of the larger clusters .",
    "m87 has turned into something of a flashpoint for discussion of this mass / metallicity relation ( mmr ) . @xcite",
    "first claimed that the mean gc color along the entire blue sequence increased roughly linearly with absolute magnitude , which would correspond to a simple power - law scaling of heavy - element abundance with cluster mass , @xmath10 , for a constant mass - to - light ratio .",
    "their measurements consisted of simple fixed - aperture photometry of @xmath11 gcs around m87 from the single - orbit exposures in @xmath12 of the galaxy that were taken as part of the virgo cluster survey @xcite .",
    "@xcite used the same material in the full virgo cluster survey analysis in which the cluster photometry was done with psf - convolved king profiles .",
    "they found much the same trend though it was less clear that the mmr was as straightforward as a linear fit in the color - magnitude plane .",
    "@xcite used ground - based @xmath13 photometry with standard psf - fitting photometry , and found a roughly linear correlation of @xmath14 color versus magnitude along the blue sequence .",
    "@xcite , on other hand , find no net mmr along the blue sequence ( that is , they find a vertical sequence of magnitude versus color ) by using size - corrected aperture photometry of about 2000 clusters from deeper hst / acs images of m87 in @xmath15 .",
    "most recently , @xcite have analyzed the same ultra - deep hst / acs data with the psf - convolved king profile technique described in @xcite to find that a significant color / magnitude slope exists for the upper half of the gc magnitude range ( roughly , for the clusters brighter than the turnover point of their luminosity function ) .",
    "thus five different measurement procedures from four partially different datasets have yielded results that are largely in mutual agreement , but also show points of disagreement that are still of some importance and need to be settled .    for comparison ,",
    "the largest gc database used specifically to analyze the mmr is the sample of @xmath16 clusters in six giant brightest cluster galaxies @xcite . there",
    ", the photometry of the individual gcs is obtained from psf - convolved king - model profiles and is taken in the metallicity - sensitive @xmath17 index and with deep exposures .",
    "increasing monotonically as the color index gets redder .",
    "the effects of other parameters on their broadband colors ( such as cluster age or @xmath18abundance ) generate far more subtle changes in color .",
    "convincing measurements of age or @xmath19 differences between old gcs traditionally require careful analysis of high@xmath20 integrated spectra and are challenging to uncover even then ; see , for example , @xcite among others , as well as comparisons of contemporary simple stellar population ( ssp ) models ( e.g * ? ? ? * ) . ] for clusters brighter than the gclf turnover the data have high s / n , and the total sample is so large that the gclf can be traced upward to the most luminous known gcs at @xmath21 .",
    "extensive evidence is presented that the mmr has a nonlinear form : the blue gc sequence is nearly vertical ( i.e. , no trend of gc color versus luminosity ) for @xmath22 and then curves toward redder color at higher luminosity .",
    "the quantitative self - enrichment model of @xcite reproduces this nonlinear mmr form fairly accurately . the key physical point in the model",
    "is that protoclusters less massive than about @xmath23 do not have deep enough potential wells to hold back much of the first round of snii - enriched gas , so for these lower - mass gcs there should be no mmr on _ either _ the blue or red sequence .",
    "conversely , for the higher - mass gcs with their deep potential wells , self - enrichment is almost automatically required .",
    "a unique prediction of this particular model is that _ both _ the red and blue gc sequences should exhibit a mmr at the top end , though it should be less noticeable for the red sequence because it starts from a much higher level of pre - enrichment .",
    "settling the issue _ on observational grounds _ of the detailed form of the mmr ( and indeed whether or not it exists in all galaxies ) is of some urgency because confusion over the form of the correlation has already arisen in the literature .",
    "yet it is likely to bear quite directly on understanding the formation of massive gcs and their early star formation history @xcite .    in this paper",
    "i discuss new photometry of the m87 gcs obtained with cfht / megacam .",
    "the data comprise a large enough gc sample ( @xmath24 ) to analyze the mmr to deep limits in addition to correlation with galactocentric distance .",
    "the sample size provides the obvious advantage that features such as the mmr , the spatial distribution , or the gclf can be studied within a _ single _ galaxy without having to put together composite samples .",
    "the results discussed in the following sections show well defined blue and red gc sequences extending to high mass , and exhibit a nonlinear mmr quite similar to the ones in the six - galaxy bcg sample .",
    "though m87 alone can hardly settle the question of the universality of the mmr , these results reinforce the need to investigate this intriguing effect further . in the present paper ,",
    "i concentrate on the various features of the color and metallicity distributions .    in this discussion",
    "i adopt a distance modulus @xmath25 for m87 and the core of the virgo cluster @xcite and a foreground absorption and reddening @xmath26 , @xmath27 . in the sdss filter system",
    "the corresponding values relevant here are @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "the 36 ccds making up the cfht megacam array provide a @xmath31 square field of view and the camera is normally used with the @xmath32 filter set ( in what follows i will drop the accents and refer to the magnitudes simply as @xmath33 ) .",
    "the image scale is @xmath34/px and the entire field makes up a 20k @xmath35 20k array .",
    "the data used in this paper consist of a single set of homogeneous exposures centered on m87 taken in @xmath36 during 2004 march and april ( harris , pi ) , as listed in table 1 . while this material will eventually be surpassed by the much more extensive cfht / megacam next - generation virgo cluster survey by ferrarese et al .",
    "( see www.astrosci.ca/ngvs ) , much can already be extracted from the earlier set of m87-centered exposures .",
    "individual exposures in each filter were taken with a `` small dither '' pattern sufficient to splice over the small gaps between the individual ccds in the array , but the much larger gaps between the top two ranks of ccds and the bottom two ranks are still present ( standard large - dither patterns are available for the camera that would cross these gaps , but these make the astrometric re - registration more difficult ) .",
    "these remaining gaps show up as two @xmath37pixel - wide blank e / w stripes in the array , making up about 3.5% of its total area on the sky .",
    "the hour - long total exposure times in each filter were chosen to reach closely similar limiting absolute magnitudes for the globular clusters .",
    "the combined images in each filter are the ones produced through the megapipe facility of cadc , and were downloaded from the cadc archive ready for photometry .",
    "the gcs around m87 are seen against a population of field objects including foreground milky way stars and background galaxies . because the virgo field is at high latitude , the contamination from stars is minimal and the main contaminants are small , faint galaxies .",
    "however , much of the field galaxy population can be removed by morphology because the gcs themselves appear starlike on these ground - based images . at the 16-mpc distance of virgo ,",
    "average _ gc half - light diameter of 5 pc @xcite is equivalent to @xmath38 , which in turn corresponds to a fwhm of @xmath39 for an average king - model concentration @xmath40 @xcite . this scale size is thus 20 times smaller than the @xmath41 fwhm seeing on the combined megacam frames in this dataset , making any such objects indistinguishable from stars .",
    "extensive quantitative tests of psf - convolved globular cluster profiles for distant galaxies such as these show explicitly that the intrinsic profile width falls below the threshold of measurement if its fwhm is less than 10 percent of the psf width ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in practice",
    ", what this means for the present data is that the gcs can be accurately measured either through conventional fixed - aperture or psf - fitting photometry .",
    "because the crowding levels are minimal , aperture photometry is adopted here ( see below ) , with an aperture radius set at its optimal value similar to the psf fwhm .",
    "use of aperture photometry also alleviates concerns over minor changes in the psf shape across the field .    as another basis of comparison ,",
    "it is worth noting that imaging of the m87 clusters with _ ground - based _ image quality of @xmath41 is almost exactly analogous to imaging clusters in the coma galaxies at @xmath42 mpc with _",
    "image quality of @xmath43 .",
    "explicit tests of psf - convolved gc profiles for the coma galaxies @xcite with deep hst data verify that the intrinsic sizes of the gcs are too small to affect their integrated magnitudes from either psf - fitting or fixed - aperture photometry at levels larger than @xmath44 mag .",
    "even further , when these second - order magnitude corrections are differenced between two filters ( @xmath45 or @xmath46 in this case ) , the effects of aperture size corrections on _ color _ are even smaller third - order ones that can be completely neglected .",
    "similar comments apply to the @xmath14 ground - based photometry of m87 and ngc 1399 by @xcite in which the seeing was @xmath47 .",
    "the first step in the photometry was to find candidate objects on all three master images and to eliminate the majority of nonstellar objects .",
    "the sextractor code @xcite was run to do this , and plots were generated of the se effective radius and fwhm versus aperture magnitude , as shown in figure [ segraphs ] .",
    "objects falling outside the generous `` stellar '' boxes marked in the figures are either very bright , saturated stars ; obviously nonstellar extended galaxies ; or extremely faint objects , all of which could be eliminated from the detection lists .",
    "next , the se - culled finding lists defined separately in @xmath48 were compared , and any objects found on _ all three _ filters and coordinate - matched to within @xmath49 px were kept for the final photometric measurement run .",
    "these matched objects were measured through _ daophot _ with an aperture radius of 3.5 px ( @xmath50 , equivalent to a linear size of 50 pc at the distance of m87 ) .",
    "crowding in this high - latitude field is negligible , and comparisons of the fixed - aperture magnitudes with psf - fitted magnitudes showed no differences in the resulting color - magnitude diagrams .",
    "the megacam stacked images in the cadc archive have internally homogeneous astrometry that is already close to the most commonly used systems ( such as sdss , 2mass , usno ) , but to ensure that the data were on a specific astrometric system as closely as possible , the usno - b1 system was selected .",
    "the usno - b1 catalog was searched for all objects within the megacam field , and the positions of these objects were matched up with the @xmath51 values returned directly from the megacam image headers .",
    "this matchup yielded 932 stars in common to within @xmath52 .",
    "small zero - point offsets equal to @xmath53 , @xmath54 in the sense ( usno - cfht ) were found , but no significant higher - order terms .",
    "figure [ astrom_resid ] shows the residuals _ after _ the native megacam astrometric coordinates were shifted onto the usno - b1 system .",
    "the object - to - object rms scatter is @xmath55 across the entire field , with no systematic deviations larger than @xmath56 .",
    "the megacam @xmath33 magnitudes are known to differ slightly from the sloan digital sky survey scales ( see the megacam webpages for updated calibration information ) . however , for the purposes of more direct comparison with other gcs data in the literature , it is useful to put the present m87 data onto the sdss scale .",
    "the sdss dr5 catalog was searched for objects in the m87 field and compared with the megacam object lists , with the result that matches were found for about 1000 stars brighter than @xmath57 .",
    "these were used directly to set the photometric zeropoints for @xmath36 in the m87 field .",
    "the mean differences @xmath58 were found to be @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , where the cfht magnitudes are the ones defined simply using the zeropoints in the image headers .",
    "a secondary advantage of tying these data closely to a widely used standard system is that the intrinsic colors of globular clusters in the @xmath62 and @xmath63 indices have not previously been well established .",
    "the virgo cluster survey data are in @xmath64 through the hst / acs filters @xcite .",
    "previously published studies of gcss for various galaxies in @xmath63 include @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite all taken with gemini / gmos , but in all of these the absolute photometric calibrations are preliminary and not likely to be accurate to better than @xmath65 mag ( see these papers for detailed discussion ) .",
    "m87 offers an excellent opportunity to set up a fiducial color scale for gcs , not just because a direct matchup to the sdss catalog is possible , but also because its foreground reddening is almost negligible and the statistical size of the gc population allows the mean colors of the red and blue sequences to be defined internally to @xmath66 mag or better ( see below ) .",
    "in figure [ cmd_raw ] the final data for 20189 starlike or near - starlike objects are shown , plotted in @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the detection rate for objects within the color range @xmath69 is highly complete for @xmath70 ; in the following analysis , the main conclusions rely even more conservatively on the interval @xmath71 and are unaffected by any incompleteness .",
    "several clearly distinct components show up .",
    "the gcs that we are after lie on the two nearly vertical , narrow sequences at @xmath72 while the populations bracketing these on the blue and red sides are the expected loci of foreground milky way halo and disk stars .",
    "any objects falling in the regions @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 ( the boundaries of which are marked by the boxes in fig .",
    "[ cmd_raw ] ) are thus rejected as field contamination .",
    "this final culling leaves 11946 objects that make up our final `` best '' gc candidate list .",
    "the distribution of the gc candidate colors by spatial location is shown in figure [ radcolor ] . here , the projected distance @xmath76 from the center of m87 is expressed in units of @xmath77 , the effective radius of the galaxy s spheroid light .",
    "a well known though still striking feature of the m87 gc system is its huge radial extent : the clusters extend detectably beyond even @xmath78 kpc or 20 @xmath79 ( see next section ) .",
    "the first hints of its huge gcs halo were already evident in the wide - field starcount work of @xcite and more clearly outlined with the ccd - based photometry of @xcite and @xcite . for comparison ,",
    "however , the @xmath80magnitude data of @xcite could be used to trace the gcs out only to the radial limits of their single - ccd field at @xmath81 kpc .",
    "@xcite used a combination of four subaru suprime - cam pointings in three colors ( @xmath82 ) to make up a surveyed region of @xmath83 , about the same total area as the single megacam field but oriented along the e / w direction . m87 itself",
    "is in the sw corner of their westernmost scam pointing , while another virgo giant ngc 4552 is in their third field pointing .",
    "an equally striking feature of the spatial distribution from fig .",
    "[ radcolor ] is the difference between the blue and red gc subpopulations .",
    "the red sequence virtually disappears into the general spread of field contamination for @xmath84 ( @xmath85 or 50 kpc ) while the blue sequence continues detectably outward much further .",
    "two other illustrations of this are shown in figures [ xypair ] and [ cmd_zone ] . as a first approximation",
    "we define the blue gcs as those in the color interval @xmath86 , and the red gcs as those in @xmath87 . in fig .",
    "[ xypair ] , the spatial positions of each type are shown . @xcite and",
    "@xcite find exactly the same phenomenon and these papers provide a more detailed discussion of the spatial distributions of each component . in fig .",
    "[ cmd_zone ] , the cmds in @xmath68 are displayed for five radial zones .",
    "whereas the blue and red sequences are almost equally populated for the innermost zone @xmath88 , the red sequence dies away more rapidly outward , leaving the blue sequence to dominate at large radii .",
    "the m87 gcs is so populous and extended that the level of background contamination ( that is , the field contamination still present in the list of starlike objects , assumed constant across the field ) is hard to determine precisely .",
    "the contamination is completely unimportant at small radii , but at the largest radii of the survey it determines the effective limit beyond which the gcs can be traced .",
    "we have no truly remote `` control field '' adjacent to m87 for measuring @xmath89 , and ultimately a definitive measurement of the background field level and the outermost radial profile of the m87 gcs will have to await the still wider - field work from the next - generation virgo survey . for the present ,",
    "the outer parts of the single megacam field itself must be used to gauge @xmath89 .",
    "a reasonable estimate can be made by noting that for @xmath90 , the areal density of _ red _ objects ( @xmath91 and @xmath92 ) is nearly uniform at @xmath93 arcmin@xmath94 , accounting for the edges of the frame and the two blank stripes in the ccd array .",
    "the color range enclosing the blue gc sequence is narrower ( @xmath86 ) , so if the color distribution of the contaminants is roughly uniform over this range , the level of the blue background will be proportionately smaller , @xmath95 arcmin@xmath94 , for the same magnitude range @xmath71 .",
    "( see also harris 2009 for more extensive tests and discussion of the background color distribution in similar high - latitude fields . )",
    "thus for the present purposes i adopt a total @xmath96 arcmin@xmath94 , with a true external uncertainty likely to be near @xmath97 arcmin@xmath94 .",
    "in the final list of gc candidates defined above , there are 8313 objects brighter than @xmath98 .",
    "subtracting off the background , this leaves a total gc population @xmath99 brighter than @xmath100 , which is about 0.2 mag brighter than the turnover ( peak ) point of the luminosity function .    the actual radial profile of both the blue and red gc subsystems can be quantified by tracing the projected surface density @xmath101 directly as a function of radius .",
    "the observed number density of all the _ candidate _",
    "gcs is by definition @xmath102 .",
    "the resulting background - subtracted data for @xmath91 are listed in table [ radialdat ] and shown in figure [ radprof ] .",
    "the columns in the table give the inner and outer radii of each annulus , the mean radius , the calculated total number of clusters in the annular zone after background subtraction , and the density @xmath101 . the conventional log / log form ( log @xmath101 vs. log @xmath76 ) is shown in the left panel , indicating that both the blue and red components fall off progressively more steeply with increasing radius . a standard hubble profile , which is a power law with a core radius @xmath103",
    ", @xmath104 provides a reasonable fit to either component .",
    "fits of this model to the data ( shown in fig .",
    "[ radprof ] ) for the blue gcs give ( @xmath105 arcmin@xmath94 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 ) ; while for the red gcs , ( @xmath108 arcmin@xmath94 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 ) .",
    "these are equivalent to simple power laws @xmath111 where the exponent @xmath112 steepens continuously with radius , @xmath113    both components also follow a devaucouleurs - law form ( log @xmath101 vs. @xmath114 ) fairly well over their entire observed run . in this form",
    "the best - fit equations describing each one are @xmath115 where again the @xmath116 s are in units of arcmin@xmath94 and the slopes are normalized to the @xmath79 of the halo light .",
    "( these lines should , however , not be extrapolated inward where the density distribution flattens off more strongly . ) for comparison , @xcite found slopes ( @xmath117)(blue ) and ( @xmath118)(red ) . as they discuss more extensively , the integrated light of the m87 halo has a @xmath119law slope of @xmath120 , strongly suggesting that the more metal - rich gc population can be directly linked to the similarly metal - rich population of the field halo stars .",
    "much other discussion of similar results from several other galaxies reinforcing this interpretation and connecting with their evolutionary histories can be found in @xcite among others , and will not be repeated here .",
    "the behavior of the devaucouleurs - type profile fit itself , near its outer edge , provides a useful consistency check of our adopted backgrounds @xmath89(blue , red ) .",
    "if we have chosen the background nearly correctly , then the resulting @xmath101 profile can plausibly be claimed ( as is the case for most other elliptical galaxies ) to follow a nearly straight line in the log @xmath101 vs.  @xmath121 plane all the way to the outer edge of the data .",
    "an overestimate of @xmath89 would cause the background - subtracted profile to drop suddenly and unrealistically to zero at the edge , whereas an underestimate would cause @xmath101 to flatten off artificially at large radius .",
    "neither one is the case ( figure 7b ) , so the choice of background levels appears to be self - consistent within their stated internal uncertainties .",
    "the @xmath101 data indicate that the blue gcs exist in detectable numbers out to at least @xmath122 or @xmath123 kpc .",
    "a final check of the present results comes from comparison with @xcite , whose scam data extend along a line towards ngc 4552 out to @xmath124 ( more than 500 kpc ) from m87 .",
    "they find the blue - sequence gcs to extend detectably to @xmath125 ( see their figures 5 and 7 ) , and present a model fit to the combined m87/n4552 counts that suggests the m87 gcs could even extend to @xmath126 and more .",
    "clearly , we have not yet traced the full extent of this system .",
    "a second - order feature of the radial color distributions ( fig .",
    "[ radcolor ] ) is a progressive change in the mean color of both the red and blue gcs with radius : in other words , both components show a metallicity gradient .",
    "this feature is clearest for @xmath127 or about 60 kpc ; beyond that point , the red clusters are almost absent and the blue clusters show no significant change in mean color . for the region inward of @xmath128 , power - law fits yield @xmath129 where both slopes are uncertain by 10 percent .",
    "the single - stellar - population models of @xcite , which provide integrated color indices for a variety of broadband colors including the sdss filters , show that @xmath130 = 0.21 \\pm 0.05 $ ] over the metallicity range [ z / h ] @xmath131 that covers most gcs .",
    "the color slopes then convert into metallicity gradients @xmath132 where @xmath133 ( blue ) and @xmath134 ( red ) .",
    "comparable data for the gcss in several other large galaxies are now in the literature . @xcite found @xmath135 ( blue ) , @xmath136 ( red ) in the other virgo supergiant ngc 4472 .",
    "@xcite found @xmath137 for the blue gcs in two fornax ellipticals , ngc 1399 and 1427 .",
    "most recently , @xcite derived a mean @xmath138 for both the blue and red gcs in six giant brightest cluster galaxies .",
    "all these results are similar , and begin to present a very consistent picture : the mean gc metallicity in these large galaxies depends on spatial location , becoming more enriched the further inward it resides in the halo .",
    "the widespread presence of metallicity gradients , albeit shallow , indicates that _ both the major epochs of gc formation _ , metal - poor and metal - rich , had a significant component of dissipative collapse of protogalactic gas and _ in situ _ formation which led to higher enrichment levels deeper in the potential wells of these large galaxies .",
    "although gradients in the range @xmath139 for the dominant _ metal - rich _ field - star component have been found in many ellipticals within their central bulges ( @xmath140 ) , the globular cluster data indicate that dissipative formation extended much further outward into their halos , to @xmath141 and beyond .",
    "what is perhaps equally important for understanding galaxy formation is that the _ metal - poor _ component , which is all but undetectable in the integrated field - star light , also has an inbuilt metallicity gradient to the same degree .",
    "this result makes it unlikely that the metal - poor stars all formed in pregalactic dwarfs that only later began to merge into bigger galaxies .",
    "instead , the first major metal - poor round of star formation must have taken place while the initial stages of hierarchical merging were already underway ( see * ? ? ? * for further discussion and references )",
    "we now look more closely at the blue and red gc sequences in the color - magnitude diagrams . the goal is to characterize each of the two sequences through their mean colors _ as a function of magnitude _ ( the mmr ) and their internal color ( metallicity ) dispersions . to define the mmr ( or lack of one )",
    "we adopt the same basic approach as used in several previous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* among others ) : the cmd is divided into narrow magnitude bins , and within each bin the color distribution of the gcs is fitted by a bimodal gaussian model . because each magnitude bin is treated independently , no _ a priori _ assumptions are made about the particular form of the mmr , whether linear or otherwise .    for the multimodal",
    "fitting , the code rmix is used here ( for extensive descriptions of rmix applied to this situation , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the default approach  facilitated by the sheer statistical size of the m87 gc population  is to allow the code to solve freely for all five basic parameters in a gaussian bimodal distribution : the mean colors of the two modes @xmath142 ( blue , red ) , their dispersions @xmath143 ( blue , red ) , and the relative numbers ( proportions ) @xmath144 of objects in each mode .",
    "the mmr along either of the sequences is then defined by any trend in the mean @xmath145 with magnitude .",
    "the bimodal fits were done for objects within the zone @xmath146 , i.e. within the part of the m87 halo where both blue and red sequences are definitely present and in roughly equal numbers ( fig .",
    "[ radcolor ] ) .",
    "we restrict the sample to objects in the color range @xmath147 , and as a preliminary step , the shallow metallicity gradient described in the previous section is removed by normalizing the color indices to the values that all the clusters would have if they were at @xmath148 .",
    "that is , for the blue - sequence gcs ( defined as those objects with @xmath149 ) , we define @xmath150 , and for the red - sequence gcs ( @xmath151 ) , we define @xmath152 .",
    "the results of these bimodal fits in both cmds are summarized in table 2 , 3 , and 4 .",
    "four separate runs were done with the following conditions , which were chosen to allow additional tests of the reality of any deduced mmr along both of the sequences :    * the data were divided into 0.25-magnitude bins in @xmath153 , and within each bin all five free parameters ( @xmath154 ) defining the bimodal gaussian fit were freely determined by the fit ( i.e. , unconstrained ) .",
    "the exceptions to this were at the bright end , where for @xmath155 half - magnitude bins were used to capture enough objects for a statistically significant fit .",
    "in addition , preliminary runs showed that for the four brightest bins ( @xmath156 ) the fully unconstrained fits tended to be unstable , so for these , the intrinsic widths of the two sequences were constrained to be equal to their average values on the lower bins , @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",

    "it is not clear that any significant trend exists and that the blue sequence could better be considered vertical . in summary , these results for m87 are closely similar to those of @xcite for six other bcg giants : the mmr for the blue sequence in m87 exists , but it is nonlinear in form and most strongly affects the most massive clusters .",
    "comparison of the megacam result with the recent thorough analysis of the deep @xmath181 data from hst / acs @xcite also shows close similarities : they found a clearly nonzero trend towards redder colors over the magnitude range @xmath182 and a nearly vertical sequence below that .",

    "second , the smaller sample size in the hst / acs data means that only a few dozen of its clusters lie above the transition level @xmath184 where the mmr starts to become significant , making it hard to distinguish above the intrinsic scatter in the sequence . a more detailed comparative analysis of the hst / acs data",

    "* ) . in most galaxies",

    "taken at face value , the red sequence would then display a `` negative mmr '' towards lower metallicity at higher mass , contrary to any existing model interpretation .",
    "nominally , the slope for the unconstrained fits in table 2 is @xmath191 , corresponding to @xmath192 .",
    "closer examination indicates , however , that this trend is not as robust as for the blue sequence .",

    "this is shown in table 4 and the upper panel of figure [ meancolors ] .",
    "the numerical tests described above show that constraining the position of the _ blue _ sequence @xmath168 has a large effect on the deduced position of @xmath190 , pulling it much further to the blue . by contrast , the opposite test of constraining the red sequence color has no important effect on the blue sequence ( lower pair of lines in figure [ meancolors ] ) .",
    "another result of these tests is shown in the lower panel of figure [ chifrac ] . here",
    ", the ratio @xmath194(constrained)/@xmath194(unconstrained ) is plotted for the different sets of bimodal fits , to demonstrate what happens to the goodness - of - fit of each solution relative to the `` baseline '' model fit of table 2 .",
    "these @xmath194 ratios are listed in the last columns of tables 3 and 4 .",
    "if we arbitrarily fix the red sequence ( table 3 , and red line in figure [ chifrac ] ) ) , then the quality of fit remains virtually as good as the baseline model except for the very brightest bin .",
    "but for the opposite case where we fix the blue sequence ( table 4 , and blue line in figure [ chifrac ] ) , a much more dramatic change occurs : at the bright end , the quality of fit degrades strongly .",
    "the same is true for the final set of fits where both sequences are arbitrarily constrained to their mean values .",
    "the case where the blue sequence is fixed also leads to a steep and unrealistic decrease in the @xmath162 ratio at the bright end ( blue line in the upper panel of figure [ chifrac ] ) .    in other words , over the range @xmath195 ( @xmath196 ) , the assumption that both sequences are strictly vertical ( no mmr ) provides an entirely reasonable fit to the data .",
    "brighter than this , the null hypothesis of no mmr becomes increasingly invalid , and closer attention must be paid to the curvature in one or both of the sequences .    in summary ,",
    "the present data point clearly to the existence of a blue - sequence mmr . correctly representing",
    "it is crucial for the quality of fit of the entire color distribution . by contrast , the data indicate  though much more hesitantly  that a negative mmr may exist along the red sequence , though we can not reject the null hypothesis ( no mmr ) as yet : the numerical tests described above show that ignoring the red mmr has very little effect on the quality of the bimodal fits .",
    "the recent study of @xcite uses a sample of @xmath197 m87 clusters measured in the less sensitive @xmath181 color , but has the advantage that it is almost completely free of field contamination .",
    "they find that the red sequence has no significant slope at all luminosity levels .",
    "the results of this study fall into line with the most complete recent collections of data for other large galaxies @xcite . above a transition point of about @xmath23 ,",
    "the low - metallicity clusters become progressively more enriched at higher luminosity , scaling as @xmath198 .",
    "this nonlinear mmr can be reasonably well understood through a basic self - enrichment model @xcite .    at the same time , a mmr of similar amplitude and reverse direction  but of much lower significance  is found along the red sequence , @xmath199 .",
    "interestingly , @xcite find a mean scaling @xmath200(red sequence ) @xmath201 for the average of 15 giant e galaxies , a result that is only marginally different from zero but at least points in the same direction as the m87 data .",
    "thus it may be worth considering how the red sequence could have embedded in it some form of substructure appearing as a mmr of its own in a way that does _ not _ require self - enrichment .    to discuss the possibilities , we first ask what the essential differences are between the two modes .",
    "the blue , metal - poor clusters make up a narrow , well defined sequence that is replicated in very much the same way over and over in galaxies of all types , differing primarily just in their total numbers within different galaxies .",
    "their mean metallicity @xmath202fe / h@xmath203 is only weakly correlated with galaxy mass and shows very much the same internal dispersion @xmath116(fe / h ) @xmath204 from one system to another ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "many lines of argument advanced in recent years have built up the view that the metal - poor gcs are likely to have formed in the first brief round of star formation within the `` pregalactic dwarfs '' that began their star formation just at the beginning of the major stage of hierarchical merging , and additional metal - poor gcs could have accreted later as part of their host dwarf satellites ( see especially * ? ? ?",

    "* among many others ) .",
    "these small host dwarfs with their shallow potential wells and initially metal - poor gas could support only one major round of star formation and thus left behind metal - poor stars plus much unconverted gas .",
    "by contrast , the red , metal - richer sequence is a more heterogeneous population that in some ways is harder to model in detail .",
    "their mean metallicity @xmath202fe / h@xmath206 correlates weakly with host galaxy luminosity @xcite .",
    "both their metallicity distribution and spatial distribution within the halos of their galaxies as a whole are similar to the _ field - star _ population that has a broad , metal - rich mdf and makes up the bulk of a typical giant elliptical @xcite .",
    "that is , the metal - rich gcs can reasonably be thought of as forming during the major stage of hierarchical merging that built most of the galaxy .",
    "hierarchical models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show that multiple `` in situ '' starbursts , major mergers , and accretions of gas - rich satellites would all have contributed to this stage .",
    "if this basic picture is correct , then the final population of metal - rich gcs would be expected to have a wide range of ages and metallicities , and more so in bigger galaxies that experienced more starbursts and merging events .",
    "furthermore , the red - gc populations should also differ in detail from one galaxy to another depending on their individual merger and starburst histories .    on the observational side",
    ", the evidence points increasingly to the same view that the metal - rich gc `` population '' is actually a composite of objects with various ages , with its subcomponent mdfs heavily overlapped and thus of nearly similar mean metallicities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "consistent with this view , both the relative numbers and luminosity functions of the red sequence differ noticeably from one galaxy to another , so that the high - luminosity end of the red gclf does not extend to the same maximum even in galaxies with similar total gc populations . for example , in ngc 1399 the blue and red sequences have very similar `` upper ends '' while in m87 the blue sequence extends much higher @xcite ; see also the difference between the antlia giants ngc 3258 and 3268 @xcite .",
    "by contrast with most other systems , in the hydra and coma supergiants ngc 3311 and ngc 4874 the red sequence is the one that extends to higher luminosity , up to cluster masses @xmath207 and perhaps higher @xcite .",
    "observations of young , massive star clusters in present - day starburst galaxies @xcite also show that the cluster formation efficiency and the initial cluster mass function can vary with the total star formation rate .",
    "these various pieces of evidence point to a way to understand , at least in principle , how we might obtain a red gc sequence with an observable mass / metallicity relation that could be _ either _ positive or negative . in the simplest such case , suppose that the metal - rich gcs comprise two main subpopulations that can be thought of as the products of the two biggest mergers or starbursts that assembled the main body of the galaxy .",
    "in addition , suppose that the earlier and slightly _ less _ metal - rich of these two starbursts generated its gcs with a broader mass function that extended to higher luminosity than did the later and metal - richer burst .",
    "what we would see today in the gcs as a whole would then be a red sequence with a broad mdf and a `` negative mmr '' at the top end .",
    "this population - based approach has nothing to do with any self - enrichment , is completely consistent with the evidence summarized above , and does not invoke any unusual physical effect .",
    "simulated gcss along these lines are now being constructed to test these ideas further and will be discussed in a later paper .",
    "wide - field photometry with cfht / megacam in @xmath36 has been used to study the properties of the m87 globular cluster system .",
    "approximately 6200 gcs have been measured to a limit @xmath208 ( equivalent roughly to @xmath209 , a little less than half the total population ) .",
    "the primary results of this study are these :    1 .",
    "the metal - poor ( blue ) and metal - rich ( red ) cluster sequences are clearly delineated especially in the @xmath63 color index .",
    "while the red sequence does not extend detectably outward to projected galactocentric distances beyond @xmath21050 kpc against the field contamination , the blue sequence can be seen to 100 kpc and beyond .",
    "both the red and blue subpopulations have shallow but significant radial metallicity gradients , corresponding to heavy - element abundance scaling with distance of @xmath4 ( blue ) and @xmath211 ( red ) .",
    "3 .   the blue sequence shows a nonlinear mass / metallicity relation : gc metallicity increases with luminosity .",
    "this relation is nearly vertical ( that is , mean color is uncorrelated with metallicity ) for @xmath180 , while at brighter levels we find a trend roughly reproduced by @xmath198 .",
    "this result agrees well with the findings in numerous other giant e galaxies , as well as the best current data on m87 itself .",
    "finding the trend depends critically on being able to sample the gc population to its highest luminosity levels .",
    "the blue - sequence mmr can be physically understood as the result of gc self - enrichment during formation .",
    "the red sequence is almost twice as broad as the blue sequence in its internal scatter of colors .",
    "the formal numerical solutions show that it has a `` negative mmr '' at the top end that is at least as steep as the blue - sequence mmr .",
    "however , the same numerical solutions show that this trend is not strongly significant , and simply assuming a constant mean color for the red sequence does not noticeably decrease the quality of the bimodal fits .",
    "5 .   in giant galaxies like m87 ,",
    "the red - gc sequence is likely to be a composite population , unlike the more internally homogeneous blue sequence .",
    "every major starburst or gas - rich merger that contributed to the formation of the main body of the galaxy should have contributed to its metal - rich gc population .",
    "if the individual major starbursts generated gcs following slightly different initial mass functions , then features such as the negative - mmr can be built in to the total red sequence that we see today .",
