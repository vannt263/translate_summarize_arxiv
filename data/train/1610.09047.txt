    "herschel observations by @xcite show several dense high mass star forming cores in this filament , including at the location of dr21(oh ) . on large scales , single dish polarimetric observations with the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) at @xmath12 and 20  angular resolution reveal uniform plane - of - sky magnetic fields that are oriented along the east - west direction , perpendicular to the filament @xcite .",
    "however , high angular resolution ( @xmath13 ) polarimetric observations of the dr21(oh )  core taken with the smithsonian millimeter array ( sma ) at @xmath12 reveal a complex magnetic field morphology in the plane of the sky , suggestive of a toroidal configuration @xcite .",
    "indicators of ongoing star formation in dr21(oh )  include strong outflows in co and other molecular lines , and maser lines of several molecules ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the redshifted masers are located predominantly in the western lobe , whereas blueshifted masers are predominantly in the eastern lobe @xcite .    in this paper , we report the detection of the zeeman effect in the 44 ghz class i ch@xmath11oh  maser line toward dr21(oh ) . in   [ obsred ] , we present details of the observations and data reduction . in   [ analysis ] we describe the analysis of the data , including the use of the new tool zeman in aips for zeeman effect data analysis .",
    "the results of our observations are presented and discussed in   [ resdisc ] . in ",
    "[ conc ] , we present our conclusions .",
    "the observations of the @xmath14 class i ch@xmath11oh  maser emission line at 44 ghz toward dr21(oh )  were carried out with the karl g. jansky very large array ( vla ) on 2012 april 25 in two consecutive 2hr sessions .",
    "the array was in c - configuration with a maximum baseline of 3.4 km .",
    "the wideband interferometric digital architecture ( widar ) correlator was configured to deliver a single 1mhz sub - band with dual polarization products ( rr , ll ) and 256 spectral channels .",
    "the resulting channel spacing was 3.90625khz , which corresponds to 0.0266 km  s@xmath0  at the observed frequency .",
    "in addition to the target source , the calibrator j1331@xmath153030 ( 3c286 ) was observed to derive the antenna - based amplitude gain factors in order to calibrate the absolute flux density scale . the uncertainty in the flux density calibration at the observed frequency , accounting for various observational parameters ( e.g. , weather , reference pointing , and elevation effects ) , is expected to be up to 10% .",
    "table  [ top ]  summarizes the parameters of our vla observations .",
    "data reduction , including calibration , deconvolution and imaging , was carried out using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ; @xcite ) .",
    "after doppler correcting the spectral - line data of dr21(oh ) , the frequency channel with the brightest maser emission signal was split off , and self - calibrated first in phase , then in both phase and amplitude , and imaged in a succession of iterative cycles .",
    "the final self - calibration solutions were applied to the full spectral - line data set of dr21(oh ) .",
    "stokes @xmath16 and @xmath17 image cubes were constructed with a synthesized beamwidth of @xmath18 at full width half maximum ( fwhm ) and at a position angle of 75.3@xmath19 .",
    "the magnetic field strength in zeeman effect observations is usually determined by fitting a numerical frequency derivative of the stokes @xmath16 spectrum to the stokes @xmath17 spectrum .",
    "the method has been described in detail most recently in @xcite , but here we repeat the key points . for historical reasons , aips calculates the stokes parameters as @xmath20  ( rcp + lcp)/2 , and @xmath21  ( rcp @xmath22 lcp)/2 , where rcp is right - circular polarization and lcp is left - circular polarization ; we use the standard radio definition of rcp as a clockwise rotation of the electric vector when viewed along the direction of wave propagation .",
    "all quoted values of @xmath16 and @xmath17 in this paper refer to the aips - generated values defined above ; even though @xmath16 and @xmath17 are both different by a factor of 1/2 from the conventional definition of stokes @xmath16 and @xmath17 , this does not affect zeeman effect results since only the relative magnitudes of @xmath17 and @xmath16 matter , as discussed below . when the zeeman splitting is much smaller than the width of the line ( @xmath23 ) , the stokes @xmath17 profile is usually fit to the equation @xcite @xmath24 since the observed @xmath17 spectrum may contain a scaled replica of the @xmath16 spectrum as a result of small calibration errors in rcp versus lcp .",
    "for the detection reported in this paper , the fit parameter @xmath25 that represents the scaled replica of the @xmath16 profile in the @xmath17 profile is @xmath26 .",
    "the fit parameter @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the magnetic field strength , @xmath29 is the angle of the magnetic field to the line of sight , and @xmath9 is the zeeman splitting factor for ch@xmath11oh . for all cases where the zeeman splitting is much smaller than the linewidth , we can only determine the line of sight magnetic field strength , @xmath30= @xmath31 .",
    "moreover , the zeeman splitting factor @xmath9 has never been measured for the 44 ghz ch@xmath11oh  transition .",
    "extrapolation of the land @xmath32-factor from lab measurements of several ch@xmath11oh  transitions near 25 ghz made by @xcite  could certainly be used to make an estimate of @xmath9 for the 44 ghz ch@xmath11oh  maser transition .",
    "however , such an extrapolation usually gives a value for the magnetic field that is at least an order of magnitude larger than expected ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we will leave our results in terms of @xmath33 ( in units of hz ) .",
    "the numerical frequency derivative of stokes @xmath16 was fitted to stokes @xmath17 using the newly available aips task zeman @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this task is that it allows multiple gaussian components in @xmath16 to be fitted simultaneously to @xmath17 with different values of @xmath34 . in other words ,",
    "each gaussian component can be fitted for a different @xmath30  value .",
    "the fitting of gaussian components in @xmath16 was carried out using the aips task xgaus , to which several interactive enhancements have been added recently @xcite . in summary , aips now provides the full capability for an end - to - end processing of zeeman observations .",
    "also convenient is that publication quality figures such as those presented in this paper can be generated in aips using the new task xg2pl .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the stokes @xmath16 profile toward the 44 ghz class i ch@xmath11oh  maser in dr21(oh )  in which we detected significant zeeman splitting .",
    "we fitted two gaussian components to the stokes @xmath16 profile .",
    "the intensity , center velocity , and full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) velocity linewidth of these two components are given in table  [ tgauss ] .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] also shows the two fitted gaussian components ( _ blue and green curves _ ; components 1 and 2 in table  [ tgauss ] respectively ) , together with their sum ( _ red curve _ ) and the residuals ( _ dotted black curve _ ) from the gaussian fit .",
    "the fits essentially reveal two masers blended in velocity , with a 219  jy  beam@xmath0  maser centered at 0.83  km  s@xmath0 , and a 82.7  jy  beam@xmath0  maser centered at 0.53  km  s@xmath0 , with fwhm velocity linewidths @xmath70.5  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "the residuals suggest an excellent fit , although there is likely a third , very low - level component in stokes @xmath16 between 1.01.3  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the stokes @xmath16 ( _ upper panel ",
    "black histogram - like line _ ) and @xmath17 ( _ lower panel  black histogram - like line _ ) profiles toward the ch@xmath11oh  maser shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the blue and green curves in the upper panel are the two gaussian components that we fitted to the stokes @xmath16 profile .",
    "the blue curve in the lower panel is the derivative of the blue - colored gaussian component in the upper panel ( component 1 in table  [ tgauss ] ) , scaled by @xmath9@xmath30@xmath35  hz , and the green curve in the lower panel is the derivative of the green - colored gaussian component in the upper panel ( component 2 in table  [ tgauss ] ) , scaled by @xmath9@xmath30@xmath36  hz .",
    "this means that the blue - colored component shows a significant zeeman detection at the level of 20-@xmath1 , whereas there is no significant detection in the green - colored component . by convention",
    ", a positive value for @xmath30  means that the line of sight magnetic field is pointing away from the observer . we have chosen to leave our results in @xmath33 , because the value of @xmath9 for the 44 ghz transition of ch@xmath11oh  has not been measured so far ( but see   [ analysis ] ) . for clarity",
    ", we have shown the sum of the two components in a separate figure ; figure  [ fig3 ] also shows the stokes @xmath16 and @xmath17 profiles as shown in figure  [ fig2 ] , but this time with the sum of the gaussians overlaid on @xmath16 ( _ upper panel ",
    "red curve _ ) and the sum of the appropriately scaled derivatives of @xmath16 overlaid on @xmath17 ( _ lower panel  red curve _ ) .",
    "it is clear in figure  [ fig3 ] that the right wing of the stokes @xmath17 profile ( 1.01.3 km  s@xmath0 ) is systematically displaced from the profile of the scaled derivative .",
    "one reason for this discrepancy could be the third low - level component in stokes @xmath16 mentioned above that is likely present between 1.01.3 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "it is possible that this low - level feature is systematically affecting the stokes @xmath17 profile .",
    "another possibility is that the stokes @xmath17 profile has undergone narrowing so that it is no longer strictly proportional to the derivative of the stokes @xmath16 profile .",
    "such narrowing was also observed and discussed by @xcite . in such cases , derived @xmath28-fields",
    "could be off by a factor of 2 , as estimated by @xcite .",
    "our detection of the zeeman effect in dr21(oh )  is in the second strongest 44 ghz ch@xmath11oh  maser spot within the field and the velocity span of our observations .",
    "our observations were aimed at detecting the zeeman effect in such masers following the initial discoveries in the 36 and 44 ghz class i ch@xmath11oh  masers @xcite .",
    "therefore , we carried out the observations by maximizing the amount of time on the target source within the observing sessions to secure detections in stokes @xmath17 . as a result , we did not spend time on phase calibrator scans to get absolute positions for the masers .",
    "we were , however , able to find absolute positions for the masers by doing fringe - rate mapping on the strongest maser in the field ( 323 jy  beam@xmath0 ) using the aips task frmap .",
    "the positions of the 24 maser spots ( @xmath37  jy  beam@xmath0 ) that we detected in dr21(oh ) , together with their intensities , center velocities , and velocity linewidth at fwhm are listed in table  [ tgauss_allmasers ] .",
    "the distribution of the 24 maser spots in our observations listed in table  [ tgauss_allmasers ] indicates that we have recovered the double arc structure in the redshifted western lobe described in @xcite .",
    "note that our velocity coverage would not have allowed us to detect any of the masers in the blueshifted eastern lobe .",
    "of interest is that our strongest maser is in the inner arc of the western lobe , whereas the strongest maser in @xcite was in the outer arc .",
    "there is reasonable agreement in position between their strongest maser ( labeled as maser 3 in their paper ) and the second strongest maser in our observations ( i.e. , the maser in which we have the zeeman detection ) , and likewise , their second strongest maser and our strongest maser also agree in position .",
    "however , there appears to be a mismatch of about 0.5  km  s@xmath0  in center velocities between our observations and those of @xcite ; note that their channel width , which is 0.66  km  s@xmath0 , is significantly coarser compared to our observations .",
    "such discrepancies preclude a direct comparison of intensities between their observations and ours , and raise the necessity for a coordinated interferometric study of the variability of class i ch@xmath11oh  masers , which to our knowledge has not been carried out so far .",
    "we did not detect the zeeman effect in the strongest maser ( @xmath7300  jy  beam@xmath0 ) in our observations .",
    "this is not entirely surprising given how complex the plane - of - sky magnetic field is known to be in the dr21(oh ) core from polarimetric observations @xcite .",
    "our strongest maser is located about 11  from the second strongest maser in which we detected the zeeman effect , and the sma polarimetric observations of @xcite reveal plane - of - sky magnetic field vectors rotated by 90  over 10  scales . therefore , it is easy to imagine the field having a component along the line of sight at the position of our second strongest maser in the outer arc of the western lobe and changing direction so that it has no line of sight component at the position of our strongest maser 11  away .",
    "all the other masers in our observations are under 20  jy  beam@xmath0 , and lack the sensitivity to detect the zeeman effect .    in all zeeman observations",
    ", it is worth considering whether the detected signal could be due to non - zeeman effects .",
    "instrumental effects can become an issue in extended sources where a velocity gradient across the source could mimic a zeeman detection , especially in single dish observations .",
    "such a possibility appears unlikely in maser observations with interferometers since masers are point sources that are confined to a narrow velocity range .",
    "if the detected signal were a false one due to instrumental polarization , especially when the source is off the peak of the primary beam , then such a signal would be dependent on the parallactic angle .",
    "therefore , the most effective way to check for such false signatures of instrumental polarization is to check for consistent results from multiple sessions that span a range of parallactic angles .",
    "since our observations were carried out in two sessions that cover different parallactic angles , we examined separately the stokes @xmath17 profile from each session , and we found our results to be consistent between sessions .",
    "moreover , @xcite  measured the zeeman effect in the 44 ghz class i ch@xmath11oh  maser line toward omc-2 before and after the new correlator was installed at the vla , and got the same result for @xmath33 , despite a change in the maser intensity .",
    "therefore , the observed stokes @xmath17 profile is likely not due to instrumental effects . besides instrumental effects , however , there are other possibilities for non - zeeman contributions to the stokes @xmath17 profile . @xcite",
    "found that strong linearly polarized maser radiation , together with changes in the orientation of the magnetic field along the line of sight , can produce circular polarization that is , in practice , indistinguishable from that produced by the zeeman effect . to date , there are no linear polarization measurements of 44 ghz ch@xmath11oh  masers in the literature .",
    "@xcite observed the polarization of ch@xmath11oh  masers at mm wavelengths ( 84.5 to 157 ghz ) and found linear polarization as high as 40% in one of their sources .",
    "absent measurements of the linear polarization of 44 ghz ch@xmath11oh  masers , we can not rule out that linear polarization is responsible for the observed stokes @xmath17 profile .",
    "however , if linear polarization were responsible , it appears unlikely that it would be converted to circular polarization for the second strongest maser in our field but not the strongest maser .",
    "another issue was described by @xcite , who found that observed antisymmetric and symmetric spectral profiles in sio masers can arise when the maser radiation scatters off populations of foreground molecules located outside the velocity range covered by the maser . due to this , the magnetic fields traced by sio masers are likely much smaller than what would result from a zeeman interpretation of their observed stokes @xmath17 profiles .",
    "if future measurements of the zeeman splitting factor for methanol masers suggest fields that are much larger than plausible , studies of the applicability of the phenomenon discussed by @xcite to class i ch@xmath11oh  masers would be important to consider . finally , another potential issue described in @xcite is that a rotation of the axis of symmetry for the molecular quantum states could cause an intensity - dependent circular polarization that could be mistakenly attributed to a zeeman splitting .",
    "this happens when the maser stimulated emission rate @xmath38 becomes larger than the zeeman frequency shift @xmath39 . in our observation of dr21(oh ) , @xmath40  s@xmath0 .",
    "the stimulated emission rate , as written by @xcite is @xmath41 where @xmath42  s@xmath0 is the einstein coefficient for the 44 ghz ch@xmath11oh  maser transition @xcite , @xmath43 is the maser brightness temperature , @xmath44 is the maser beaming solid angle , @xmath45 44069.488 mhz is the frequency of the maser transition , @xmath46 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath47 is the planck constant . for the 44 ghz ch@xmath11oh  maser in which we have detected the zeeman effect in dr21(oh ) , we get @xmath48  k , and from @xcite , we calculate @xmath49 .",
    "putting all this information in equation  ( [ eq2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath50  s@xmath0 .",
    "therefore , it is clear that @xmath51 , implying that such a non - zeeman contribution to the observed splitting is unlikely .",
    "moreover , this effect would cause an intensity - dependent polarization , but our strongest maser does not show a zeeman effect .    from observations of the zeeman effect in the cn(1@xmath220 ) line , @xcite measured @xmath30  = 0.36 and 0.71  mg in the 1.4 mm sources mm1 and mm2 @xcite in dr21(oh ) , in which the molecular hydrogen densities are @xmath52 @xmath4 .",
    "we can use their magnetic field strengths and density , together with the predicted densities for 44 ghz class i ch@xmath11oh  masers , to estimate a value for @xmath30  in the 44 ghz line if the @xmath53 relation from @xcite applies for class i ch@xmath11oh  masers .",
    "recently , @xcite found that bright class i methanol masers are pumped in high - density regions , corresponding to @xmath3  @xmath4 . using all of the above information in the @xmath53 relation",
    ", we find that magnetic field strengths traced by 44 ghz class i masers should be in the range of 9 - 17  mg if the 44 ghz ch@xmath11oh  masers are excited at @xmath54  @xmath4 , or as low as 3 - 5  mg for @xmath55  @xmath4 .",
    "meanwhile , @xcite applied a dispersion analysis to polarimetry data observed with the combined array for research in millimeter astronomy ( carma ) by @xcite and found the plane of sky magnetic field strength in dr21(oh )  to be @xmath71.2  mg .",
    "if @xmath56  @xmath4 in these regions @xcite , then the @xmath53 relation would imply that the magnetic field strengths traced by 44 ghz class i ch@xmath11oh  masers are in the range of 3 - 9  mg if such masers are excited at @xmath3  @xmath4 . while it is possible that the @xmath53 relation might not hold in shocked regions , line of sight magnetic field strengths @xmath57  mg are certainly plausible in such regions .",
    "using our measured value of @xmath58  hz would then imply a zeeman splitting factor of @xmath59 hz  mg@xmath0 for the 44 ghz methanol line .",
    "such small values of @xmath59 hz  mg@xmath0 would not be surprising because the ch@xmath11oh  molecule is non paramagnetic , like h@xmath10o . for comparison , @xmath60  hz  mg@xmath0 for the 22 ghz h@xmath10o maser line @xcite ;",
    "such values for h@xmath10o and ch@xmath11oh  are a factor @xmath61 smaller than @xmath62  hz  @xmath63 g ( i.e. , 2800 hz  mg@xmath0 ) for the 21 cm atomic hydrogen line .",
    "of course , this is only an empirical attempt to determine @xmath9 , and we need more data points in light of the fact that there are no lab measurements or theoretically calculated values of @xmath9 for the 44 ghz ch@xmath11oh  transition .",
    "if @xmath30  @xmath710  mg in these shocked regions , then the magnetic energy density given by @xmath64 is @xmath65  ergs @xmath4 , where we have used @xmath66 from @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the ( thermal plus turbulent ) kinetic energy density is given by @xmath67 , where @xmath68 assuming 10% he , and @xmath69 is the proton mass .",
    "the velocity dispersion @xmath1 is related to the linewidth @xmath70 by @xmath71 . to judge the relevance of the magnetic field , it is best to use a value of @xmath70 that is larger than the 0.5  km  s@xmath0  we get from the ch@xmath11oh  masers , e.g. , @xmath75 km  s@xmath0  measured in the millimeter lines of methanol ( at 218 ghz ) by @xcite . with @xmath725  km  s@xmath0  in regions with @xmath73  @xmath4 , the kinetic energy density is @xmath74  ergs  @xmath4 .",
    "that would imply that the magnetic energy density is comparable to the kinetic energy density .",
    "therefore , the magnetic field would have a significant role in the dynamics of these shocked regions even if their densities were as high as @xmath75  @xmath4 .",
    "of course , we have to be careful not to get into a circular argument .",
    "the comparison of magnetic and kinetic energy densities above has only been made to check for plausibility of the derived field value if the value of @xmath9 were found to be @xmath76 hz  mg@xmath0 , as we have determined by the empirical method described above .",
    "we have detected the zeeman effect in the 44 ghz class i ch@xmath11oh  maser line toward the star forming region dr21(oh ) . toward the second brightest maser in dr21(oh ) , we find @xmath77  hz .",
    "we have left our result in terms of @xmath33 because the zeeman splitting factor @xmath9 has never been measured for the 44 ghz transition of ch@xmath11oh .",
    "the distribution of the 24 masers that we detected reveals the double arc structure in the redshifted western lobe reported by @xcite .",
    "the maser in which we have detected the zeeman effect is located in the outer arc of this redshifted western lobe , whereas the strongest maser in our observations is located in the inner arc .",
    "we did not detect the zeeman effect in the strongest maser in dr21(oh )  which is located 11  from the second strongest maser in which we detected the zeeman effect .",
    "this is not surprising , given the complex morphology of the plane - of - sky magnetic field as revealed by polarimetric observations with the sma , in which the plane - of - sky magnetic field vectors were observed to rotate by 90  over 10  scales @xcite .",
    "zeeman effect measurements in the cn ( 1@xmath220 ) line @xcite , together with the @xmath53 relation from @xcite , imply that magnetic field strengths in the 44 ghz class i ch@xmath11oh  maser regions should be @xmath710  mg ; this is also the case if we start with plane - of - sky magnetic field strengths determined using a dispersion analysis of polarimetry data @xcite .",
    "our detected value of @xmath33 then implies that @xmath59 hz  mg@xmath0 for the 44 ghz methanol transition ; such a small value of @xmath9 is entirely plausible since the ch@xmath11oh  molecule is non paramagnetic , like h@xmath10o .",
    "the observations reported in this paper , therefore , allow for an empirical determination of @xmath9 .",
    "such efforts are important because there are currently no laboratory measurements or theoretically calculated values of @xmath9 for the 44 ghz ch@xmath11oh  transition , but data from observations of a larger number of sources are needed to make such empirical determinations robust .",
