    "we resolve the inner disk cavity , reimage the thermal ir - bright spiral arm , and recover the hd 100546 b protoplanet .",

    "we observed hd 100546 with gpi on 18 january 2015 under exceptional ( 03 in the optical ) seeing conditions in @xmath7 band ( @xmath8 = 1.6 @xmath9 m , @xmath10 = 4449 ; 0014166 pixel@xmath11 ) behind the apodized pupil lyot coronagraph ( @xmath12 @xmath2 012 ) and in angular differential imaging mode ( adi ; * ? ? ? * ) . due to a slight off - centering of the mask edge ,",

    "basic data reduction utilized the _ gemini data reduction pipeline , version 1.2.1 _ @xcite .",
    "for point - spread function ( psf ) subtraction , we used the _ adaptive , locally optimized combination of images _ algorithm ( a - loci * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) considering a moving pixel mask and exploring a range of algorithm settings : the rotation gap criterion ( @xmath15 ) , the optimization area ( @xmath16 ) , the _ singular value decomposition _ ( svd ) cutoff ( _ svd@xmath17 _ ) .",
    "our previous detection of hd 100546 b favored algorithm settings including a large rotation gap , high svd cutoff and pixel masking , since hd 100546 b is embedded in strong , azimuthally - varying disk signal @xcite .",
    "a small rotation gap allows us to access regions down to the coronagraph mask edge . as a compromise",

    "we constructed a final data cube from a median - combination of psf - subtracted cubes and collapse the cube to yield a band - averaged image .    to separately assess the hd 100546 disk structure in total intensity , we rotated each data cube to north - up , median - combining the cubes using a @xmath18-clipped mean , collapsing the cube to form a final image , and spatially filtered this image using a 15x15 moving box .",
    "we downloaded public hd 100546 @xmath7 band coronagraphic polarmetry obtained during gpi commissioning on 12 december 2013 , consisting of four 58.2 second exposures at four waveplate position angles with the same coronagraph mask as used with the ifs data , although better centered . for basic processing",
    ", we subtracted a dark frame , determined the position of the lenslet spots , destriped the image , and interpolated over bad pixels .",
    "we constructed a registered polarization data cube consisting of two orthogonal polarizations , subtracting the mean stellar and instrumental polarization as estimated from the signal within the mask .",
    "we use double differencing to clean the polarization pairs , rotate each image to north up and combine the sequence to produce a total intensity image and the @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 polarized intensity images .    combining the @xmath19 and @xmath20 images as in @xcite yields linear polarized intensity images along the perpendicular and parallel directions ( _ p@xmath22 _ and _ p@xmath23 _ ) .",

    "in contrast to previous results , the northwest region closest to the star has the highest polarization , roughly 1.5x that of the southeast region .",

    "we recover the thermal ir - bright spiral arm albeit partially subtracted such that only the spine is visible .",

    "multiple additional reductions spanning a range of algorithm space confirm our interpretation that this peak is a real astrophysical feature .",
    "our polarimetry data clarify the morphology of the hd 100546 disk .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , we determined the disk s surface brightness ( sb ) profile along the major and minor axes ( figure [ disksb ] , left panel ) , fixing the northwest major axis brightness at 015 to 9.0 mag arcsec@xmath28 as measured in these papers . while our pi profiles generally agree with these studies , polarization is _ lower _ at @xmath24 @xmath27 1 . in agreement with @xcite , we see evidence for a turnover in sb at @xmath24 @xmath2 015016 consistent with the presence of the disk s inner cavity at a projected separation @xmath1 @xmath4 14 au . following methods outlined in @xcite , our derived disk position angle is @xmath4 148@xmath25 as measured from the location of the brightest pixels on the northwest and southeast sides or @xmath4 154@xmath25 from the  centroid \" of the brightest regions of these sides .",
    "we can not disentangle the stellar psf from the disk in total intensity nor can we use the interpolation method of @xcite to extract the total intensity disk signal because the disk is not confined to a ring but essentially covers 2@xmath29 radians from r @xmath2 014 to r @xmath2 06 .",
    "thus , we can not derive a map of the disk fractional polarization .",
    "there is no polarized intensity peak at the location of hd 100546 b ( figure 1a , white x ) ; the southeast polarization peak is not coincident with but counterclockwise of the candidate companion s position .",
    "the thermal ir bright spiral arm and other ( candidate ) spiral arms do not appear in polarized light .",

    ", we simulate the detection and annealing of signals with a variety of spatial scales using a - loci forward - modeling @xcite .",
    "we derive the gpi psf in each wavelength slice from the average of satellites in the an unsharp - masked , median - combined stack of data cubes .",
    "we consider an unresolved point source and extended sources up to 4 pixels in radius , comparable to sizes found by @xcite to be consistent with hd 100546 b s @xmath30 detection and determine the proper scaling between the model psf and the data by minimizing the determinant of the hessian matrix at hd 100546 b s position ( see * ? ? ?",
    "subtracting a best - fit point source at hd 100546 b yields a flat disk signal without over subtracting the disk ( figure [ disksb ] , right panel ) , providing evidence that hd 100546 b likely has a point - source component .",
    "a two - pixel radius extended source can not easily be ruled out , but produces higher residuals along the psf y - axis and some evidence of over subtraction ( i.e. a slight depression in signal at hd 100546 b s location fainter signal ) . a four - pixel radius extended source yields very strong residuals : brighter , nonphysical peaks lying just exterior the circular region defining the background disk feature .      assuming hd 100546 b is a point source at its core",
    ", we can estimate the point source component s photometry and colors .",
    "using the best - fit point source scaling , hd 100546 b s apparent magnitude : @xmath31 = 19.40 @xmath26 0.32 , where the errors consider the intrinsic snr , the uncertainty in the satellite spot calibration , and the uncertainty in the throughput correction . using the models of @xcite adopted in @xcite , the disk extinction at hd 100546 b s location is @xmath32 = 3.4 . assuming a distance of 97 @xmath26 4 @xmath33 @xcite , the unreddened absolute magnitude is then @xmath34 = 11.06 @xmath26 0.33 .",
    "as shown in figure [ bcmd ] , the protoplanet s @xmath7 absolute magnitude is comparable to that for objects near the m / l transition , but with @xmath7-@xmath30 @xmath4 3.2 it is redder than all but the reddest l / t transition dusty / cloudy young superjovian planet , hd 95086 b @xcite .",
    "red near - to - mid ir colors have been cited as evidence for thicker clouds than present in field brown dwarfs with similar temperatures @xcite .",
    "however , hd 100546 b lies redward of the ames - dusty model locus , the rough limit of a realistic cloudy atmosphere filled with submicron - sized dust .",
    "the infrared colors of hd 100546 b s point source component suggest the presence of a circumplanetary disk as hypothesized by @xcite . the object is redder than gsc 06214b , a substellar companion whose accreting circumsecondary disk produces a broadband mid - ir excess @xcite .",
    "the predicted diagram positions for accreting protoplanets from @xcite matches hd 100546 b s position for an inner radius of 1 @xmath35 and an accretion rate of 3 @xmath3610@xmath37 @xmath38/@xmath3@xmath36(@xmath3 yr@xmath11 ) . for an inner radius of 2 @xmath35 , comparable to the estimated radii for the youngest imaged planets @xcite , the models are about 0.75 mags too red .",
    "the inconsistency can be reconciled if the @xmath7-band emission originates from a higher temperature planetary photosphere ( e.g. @xmath39 @xmath4 10002000 k ) , while the disk dominates the @xmath30 emission .",

    "the putative  hd 100546 c \" requires careful scrutiny despite its high detection significance . on one hand , its position is at an identical separation to and within 2-@xmath18 of the position angle predicted for a second protoplanet (  hd 100546 c \" ) orbiting hd 100546 near the inner disk wall ( @xmath24 @xmath4 014 , 130@xmath25 @xmath26 10@xmath25 for 18 january 2015 ) .",
    "it is not the same feature as the local peak in polarized intensity ; it appears _ interior to _ the pi - inferred disk wall .",
    "however , the candidate is located very close to the mask edge ( @xmath40r@xmath41 @xmath4 0020 ) : disk emission continuing at smaller separations would be preferentially extincted on one side . if ",
    "hd 100546 c \" is instead the brightest region of an inner disk rim which extends to r @xmath42 012 , the mask extinction in combination with psf annealing could make it appear like a point source . to assess these effects",

    "figure [ bcmd ] ( right panel ) compares representative simulated images to the data and to the disk rim model .",
    "the simulated rim model struggles to reproduce the shape of the candidate : the emission confined far too narrowly in angular separation and shifted clockwise .",
    "the 4-pixel wide extended source model ( not shown ) fails in a similar manner . while the simulated point source ( not shown ) shows far better agreement at the location of the candidate , combining its signal with that of the simulated disk rim model ( especially for pa = 150 - 155@xmath13 ) fares even better , reproducing both the main signal _ and _ the residual trail of residual emission wrapping clockwise from the seven oclock position to nine oclock position .",
    "photometry for  hd 100546 c \" is broadly consistent with that expected from a young protoplanet .",
    "if it lies interior to the disk , our forward - modeling suggests an upper limit on the point source component s apparent magnitude of 13.08 @xmath26 0.64 , comparable to a 1020 @xmath3 newly - formed planet @xcite , consistent with estimates based on modeling the inner disk s morphology @xcite .",
    "hd 100546 b likely includes a point source component and derives some of its emission from circumplanetary material .",
    "its @xmath7-band spectrum could provide the first assessment of how a protoplanet spectrum compares to that for fully - formed planets and brown dwarfs ( cloutier et al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    ". given extreme computational challenges in forward - modeling the complex hd 100546 disk structure and our lack of knowledge about what an infant protoplanet s spectrum ( likely including planet and circumplanetary signal ) should look like , extracting a spectrum for the disk to compare with that of hd 100546 b and decisively interpreting the protoplanet is not feasible right now .",
    "however , future observations utilizing a reference psf may obviate the need for forward modeling of the disk and allow us to at least directly compare the disk s spectrum to that of the protoplanet .",
    "although circumstantial evidence suggests that the putative  hd 100546 c \" may be the proposed second planet responsible for clearing out the inner disk cavity , our analysis is not conclusive since the source is close to the disk wall and the gpi coronagraph mask edge .",
    "alternate scenarios include a stationary , weakly polarized disk feature and an orbiting ( unresolved ? ) disk hot spot that may or may not be induced by a planet .",
    "if the candidate is a planet and is rapidly accreting gas , it may show up as unusually bright in @xmath44 or pa@xmath45 .",
    "orbital monitoring may also clarify the nature of this candidate .",
    "a planet in keplerian orbit at 13 au around a 2.4 @xmath46 star and coplanar with the disk moves @xmath4 12@xmath25 year@xmath11 in the @xcite model .",
    "projected on the sky this motion is @xmath4 2 gpi pixels over the next two years and thus may be too small to confirm orbital motion to distinguish this candidate from a stationary disk feature",
    ". however , the predicted companion from @xcite should have been at an orbital phase of @xmath4 154@xmath25 on 18 january 2015 .",
    "once its orbital phase reaches 180@xmath25 it will be positioned directly _ behind _ the disk wall in projection .",
    "thus , if the candidate ",
    "hd 100546 c \" is the predicted protoplanet inferred from co rovibrational measurements , not a stationary disk feature or a planet - induced hot spot on the disk wall , it will likely disappear from view sometime in 2017 .",
    "co monitoring and gpi multi - epoch imagery combined with wider parameter space of simulated disk rim models should soon determine the nature of this candidate and clarify the inner circumstellar environment of hd 100546 .",
