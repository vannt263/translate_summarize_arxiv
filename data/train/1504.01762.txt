    "during the last decades there has been great interest in the model of a harmonic oscillator confined to boxes of different shapes and sizes@xcite .",
    "such model has been suitable for the study of several physical problems ranging from dynamical friction in star clusters@xcite to magnetic properties of solids@xcite and impurities in quantum dots@xcite .",
    "one of the most widely studied models is given by a particle confined to a box with impenetrable walls at @xmath1 and @xmath2 bound by a linear force that produces a parabolic potential - energy function @xmath3 , where @xmath4 .",
    "when @xmath5 the problem is symmetric and the eigenfunctions are either even or odd ; such symmetry is broken when @xmath6 . although interesting in itself , this model is rather artificial since the cause of the force is not specified .",
    "it may , for example , arise from an infinitely heavy particle clamped at @xmath7 .",
    "for this reason we have recently studied the somewhat more interesting and realistic case in which the other particle also moves within the box@xcite . such a problem",
    "is conveniently discussed in terms of its symmetry point - group ; for example : it is @xmath8 when the two particles are different and @xmath9 for identical ones .",
    "it follows from what was just said that the case of identical particles is of greater interest from the point of view of symmetry . for this reason in this paper",
    "we analyse the model of three interacting particles confined to a one  dimensional box with impenetrable walls . in section  [ sec : general_trap ] we consider three particles in a general one - dimensional trap with two - particle interactions and discuss its symmetry as well as suitable coordinates for its treatment . in section  [ sec:1d_box ]",
    "we focus on the case that the trap is given by a box with impenetrable walls and apply perturbation theory based on the exact results for infinitely small box length . in section  [ sec : infinite_box ] we discuss the limit of infinite box length as well as the connection between both regimes . in section  [ sec : rr ] we construct a symmetry - adapted basis set for the application of the rayleigh - ritz variational method and discuss the main features of the spectrum .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we provide further comments on the main results of the paper and draw conclusions .",
    "we consider three structureless particles in a one - dimensional trap with a hamiltonian of the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 confines each particle in a given space region ( trap ) and @xmath12 are two - body interactions that couple the particles .",
    "it is convenient to define dimensionless coordinates @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a suitable length unit .",
    "the resulting dimensionless hamiltonian is @xmath15 , \\label{eq : h_dimensionless}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 , etc . in this equation @xmath18",
    "is a dimensionless parameter that measures the strength of the coupling interaction .    from now on",
    "we omit the prime and simply write @xmath19 instead of @xmath20 .",
    "in addition to it , we assume that the trap is symmetric : @xmath21 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath22 is invariant under the following transformations @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the different permutations of the three real numbers @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27@xcite .",
    "note that the @xmath28 coordinate transformations ( [ eq : trans_oh ] ) form a group that is commonly named @xmath29@xcite . in the particular case that @xmath30 the symmetry of @xmath31",
    "is given by the full rotation group @xmath32@xcite .",
    "when @xmath33 the hamiltonian is invariant under the @xmath34 coordinate transformations @xmath35 and we can describe the symmetry of the system in configuration space by means of the point group @xmath0@xcite . however , if @xmath30 the symmetry increases because the trapping potential is invariant under arbitrary rotations about any axis in configuration space . the coordinate transformation @xmath36 , where@xcite @xmath37 makes the coupling term independent of @xmath38 because @xmath39 since the coupling term is therefore invariant under rotations about the @xmath38 axis by angles of @xmath40 , @xmath41 the resulting hamiltonian operator @xmath42 ,   \\nonumber \\\\ & &   \\label{eq : h_dim_d6h}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is separable into its @xmath43 and @xmath38 parts and exhibits symmetry @xmath44 .",
    "if @xmath45 the resulting hamiltonian @xmath46 is fully separable and exhibits symmetry @xmath47@xcite .",
    "as stated in the introduction we are interested in a system of three identical particles in a one - dimensional box . to this end",
    "we resort to the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_dimensionless ] ) and choose the trapping potential @xmath48 therefore , the boundary conditions for the solutions to the schrdinger equation @xmath49 become @xmath50 for concreteness we focus the discussion on the hamiltonian @xmath51 ,   \\label{eq : h_model}\\ ] ] that is an extension of the two - particle model discussed earlier@xcite .",
    "this problem is exactly solvable when @xmath52 and the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of @xmath31 are @xmath53 all the sets of quantum numbers produced by the distinct permutations @xmath54 lead to the same energy ( degenerate eigenstates ) .",
    "in addition to it , there is a pythagorean degeneracy@xcite that we do not discuss here .",
    "each of the functions @xmath55 is even ( @xmath56 ) or odd ( @xmath57 ) when @xmath58 is either odd or even , respectively .",
    "a straightforward analysis based on group theory shows that@xcite @xmath59 where @xmath60 denotes a set of distinct permutations of products of functions @xmath61 with the indicated symmetry .",
    "the characters for every irrep , as well as some of the basis functions for them , are given in table  [ tab : d3d ] .",
    "it is instructive to carry out a straightforward calculation based on perturbation theory of first order .",
    "for the first energy levels we have @xmath62 the eigenvalues that are degenerate at @xmath52 exhibit the same parity @xmath63 or @xmath64 . note that the energy levels @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( stemming from the set of quantum numbers @xmath67 ) remain degenerate at first order .",
    "we will discuss them in section  [ sec : rr ] .",
    "the parameter @xmath18 introduced in section  [ sec : general_trap ] is proportional to the square of an arbitrary length @xmath14 . in the particular case discussed in section  [ sec:1d_box ]",
    "the three particles are confined into a box of length @xmath68 as shown by the boundary conditions ( [ eq : box_bc ] ) .",
    "therefore , the infinite - box limit @xmath69 corresponds to @xmath70 .",
    "we appreciate that when @xmath70 the motion of the system center of mass is unbounded and the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian operator are of the form @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a harmonic - oscillator eigenfunction , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "the eigenvalues behave asymptotically as @xmath75 since the symmetry of the eigenfunction is conserved as @xmath18 increases we expect that the small-@xmath18 eigenfunctions are connected with @xmath76 instead of ( [ eq : eigenfunctions_free_motion ] ) .",
    "the symmetry of these functions is also given by equation ( [ eq : symmetry_(s , s , s ) ] ) .",
    "for example , we expect that @xmath77 it is worth noting that @xmath43 and @xmath38 are bases for the irreps @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively .",
    "as indicated in earlier papers on the application of group theory to a variety of problems@xcite , we can obtain approximate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of @xmath19 from the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix representation @xmath80 of the hamiltonian operator for every irrep @xmath81 that we can treat separate from the other irreps . in the present case the linear combinations of eigenfunctions of @xmath31 ( [ eq : h0_eigenval_eigenfun ] ) adapted to the symmetry species are @xmath82    @xmath83    @xmath84    @xmath85    @xmath86    @xmath87    where @xmath88 .",
    "it is understood that @xmath89 means that the three subscripts are different ; equal subscripts are indicated explicitly as in @xmath90 or @xmath91 .    in this paper",
    "we have carried out a diagonalization of the matrix representation of the hamiltonian operator with @xmath92 basis functions of each symmetry species .",
    "[ fig : ea1g]-[fig : eeu ] show @xmath93 and @xmath94 for the first eigenvalues of each irrep .",
    "the latter illustrate the conclusions drawn in section  [ sec : infinite_box ] and in particular equations ( [ eq : e_inf_box ] ) . to facilitate the analysis we have drawn horizontal dashed lines that mark the limits ( [ eq : eigenvalues_free_motion ] ) .",
    "it is well known that eigenvalues of the same symmetry do not cross but exhibit what is commonly known as avoided crossings@xcite .",
    "[ fig : ea1g]-[fig : eeu ] exhibit some clear avoided crossings and others that appear to be actual crossings because of the scale of the figures . as an example in fig .",
    "[ fig : ea1g_c ] we show the third and fourth states of symmetry @xmath95 on a finer scale to make it clear that they in fact undergo an avoided crossing .",
    "[ fig:3a1g-2eg ] shows a most interesting feature of the spectrum of this system of identical particles .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath66 and @xmath65 are almost degenerate for small @xmath18 ( in section  [ sec : rr ] we have seen that they share the same energy of order zero and first order correction ) .",
    "however , the slope of the energy level @xmath65 changes dramatically at the avoided crossing @xmath96 with the level @xmath97 but the slope of @xmath66 does not change and the latter level approaches and remains close to @xmath97 for @xmath98 .",
    "it is interesting that a simple one - dimensional model exhibits such a rich symmetry .",
    "we have shown that group theory is remarkably useful for the interpretation of the results produced by approximate methods like perturbation theory and the variational method .",
    "the treatment of each irrep separately from the others renders the analysis of the spectrum considerably simpler .",
    "for example , the avoided crossings between levels of equal symmetry can be studied separate from the crossings between levels of different symmetry .",
    "the interplay among the energy levels @xmath65 , @xmath97 and @xmath66 is most interesting and one wonders if such behaviour also takes place in more realistic models of quantum - mechanical problems .",
    "since the symmetry of the problem does not change with @xmath18 we can resort to group theory to predict the connection of the states in the small-@xmath18 and large-@xmath18 regimes embodied in eq .",
    "[ eq : e_inf_box ] .",
    "these results were confirmed by the accurate rayleigh - ritz variational calculation in section  [ sec : rr ] .",
    "group theory is also useful for the calculation of matrix elements of observables because we already know beforehand which of them vanish .",
    "this is the reason why we can treat each irrep separate from the others in the rayleigh - ritz calculation .",
    "the prediction of zero matrix elements is also the basis , for example , of the well known selection rules in spectroscopic transitions@xcite .",
    "in closing we mention that the combination of group theory and perturbation theory has recently led us to the conclusion that the well known parity - time symmetry is less easily broken that other forms of the more general space - time symmetry@xcite .",
    "this result is of great relevance for the study of non - hermitian hamiltonians .",
    "all the figures in this paper have been produced by means of the tikz package@xcite .      in order to facilitate the application of group theory to systems of identical particles f.m.f . resorted to some of the programs contributed ( for other purposes ) by the derive user group@xcite .",
    "in particular , f.m.f . would like to thank joseph bhm for useful discussions about such programs .",
