    "millisecond pulsars ( msps ) represent a distinct population of rotation - powered pulsars , characterized by short spin periods , @xmath10 ms , and small intrinsic spin - down rates , @xmath11 , implying relatively low surface magnetic dipole field strengths @xmath12 g and large characteristic spindown ages @xmath13 gyr .",
    "these objects have been studied extensively at radio wavelengths since their discovery @xcite but at x - ray energies , where the bulk of observable radiation is expected , this has become possible only relatively recently , owing to their intrinsic faintness ( @xmath14 ergs s@xmath3 ) .",
    "the _ rosat _",
    "observatory was the first to detect x - ray emission from msps , including 10 in the field of the galaxy and one in the globular cluster m28 ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "in recent years , the unprecedented sensitivity and spatial resolution of the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ have allowed the detection of x - ray counterparts to radio msps in several globular clusters : 47 tucanae and ngc 6397 @xcite , ngc 6752 @xcite , m4 @xcite , possibly m30 @xcite , and m71 ( elsner et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "in addition , the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ telescopes have allowed much more detailed studies of the existing sample of x - ray - detected msps than previously possible @xcite .        the x - ray emission detected from msps is observed to be both of non - thermal and thermal character . in the x - ray",
    "bright msps , b182124 and b1937 + 21 , the narrow x - ray pulse profiles indicate the emission is beamed and , therefore , must be non - thermal radiation originating in the pulsar magnetosphere @xcite . alternatively ,",
    "as seen in the `` black widow '' pulsar , b1957 + 20 , non - pulsed non - thermal x - rays can be produced by interaction of the relativistic particle wind from the pulsar with matter from a stellar companion or the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "thermal emission observed from nearby msps ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is believed to originate from the magnetic polar caps of the underlying neutron star ( ns ) , heated by a backflow of energetic particles from the pulsar magnetosphere ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* and references therein ) .    the detection of 16 msps in the globular cluster 47 tucanae ( ngc 104 , henceforth 47 tuc ) by the _ chandra _",
    "acis - i instrument has granted an excellent opportunity for a detailed study of the physical properties of this class of objects @xcite .",
    "these pulsars were discovered at radio wavelengths by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . with further pulse timing observations",
    ", @xcite were able to obtain precise positions for 16 of the 22 msps presently known in this globular cluster @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite detected the optical counterpart of 47 tuc w , which does not have an accurate radio timing position , by matching the binary phase and period of an optical candidate with that of the radio pulsar .",
    "finally , timing solutions have recently been obtained for 47 tuc r and y ( freire et al .",
    ", in preparation ) thus increasing the number of msps with known positions in this cluster to 19 .",
    "@xcite have reported in detail on the analysis of the x - ray emission properties of the 47 tuc msps , using the _ chandra _ acis - i observations mentioned above .",
    "however , due to the inherent faintness of these sources ( @xmath2 ergs s@xmath3 ) and the limited exposure time ( 72 kiloseconds of total data obtained resulting in 1 - 30 detected counts for each msp ) , the exact nature of the x - ray emission could not be determined with great confidence , although some interesting constraints could be placed . in the meantime ,",
    "additional x - ray observations of 47 tuc have been carried out , allowing further study of the properties of globular cluster msps as well as msps in general .    in this paper , we present spectral and long - timescale variability analyses of the x - ray counterparts of msps in the globular cluster 47 tuc based on deep _ chandra _ acis - s observations .",
    "this paper extends the work presented in @xcite .",
    "the work is organized in the following manner :  2 describes the observations and data reduction procedure ; in  3 we discuss the x - ray spectral properties of the msps , while in  4 we investigate the long - term temporal behavior of the x - ray emission ; in  5 we compare the x - ray and radio pulsar properties .",
    "finally , in  6 we discuss the implications of the results presented and offer conclusions in  7 .",
    "the data set presented here consists of four 65-kilosecond observations of the core of the globular cluster 47 tuc with the s3 chip of the _ chandra _ acis - s detector at the focus .",
    "the first three observations were performed between 2002 september 29 and october 3 , while the fourth was carried out on 2002 october 11 .",
    "these observations have resulted in the detection of @xmath15300 x - ray sources within the half - mass radius of 47 tuc , including x - ray counterparts to all of the 19 msps with known positions . in this present paper",
    "we focus on the counterparts of the radio msps ; for a comprehensive analysis of the other x - ray sources , see @xcite .",
    "the initial data reduction and image processing were performed using the ciao 3.0 software package and are also described in detail by @xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows the combined image of all four observations with @xmath16 circles centered at the radio position of each msp .",
    "the ciao tool wavdetect was able to detect an x - ray source at the position of each of the radio msps , including 47 tuc c , l , m , q , and t , which were not detected or only marginally detected in the 2000 acis - i observations @xcite .",
    "the msps 47 tuc g and i , separated by just @xmath17 , could not be individually resolved , whereas 47 tuc f and s , separated by @xmath18 , were again identified as a single elongated source . in this paper , we also include analyses of msp w , whose optical counterpart was found by @xcite to coincide with the x - ray source w29 @xcite , and the msps r and y , whose recently obtained radio timing solutions ( freire et al . , in preparation )",
    "place them at the positions of the x - ray sources w198 and w82 , respectively .    to facilitate the spectral and variability analyses , the counts for each msp in the 0.38 kev energy band",
    "were extracted from circular regions with @xmath16 radii around the radio msp positions .",
    "these circles enclose @xmath19@xmath20% of the total energy for 0.51 kev thermal sources .",
    "a slightly more involved extraction method was required for 47 tuc f and s , whose extraction circles overlap , as evident in figure 1 .",
    "the relative contribution of counts from each msp was determined by maximum likelihood fits of two - dimensional gaussians to the five x - ray sources in the vicinity of the radio positions of f and s using the _ sherpa _ application in ciao .",
    "this procedure was carried out in the 0.34 kev range , as well as in three narrow bands ( 0.30.8 kev , 0.81.5 kev , and 1.54 kev ) to allow an approximate spectral analysis . using this method",
    "we find that @xmath21% of the total counts can be attributed to s. for 47 tuc g and i , this was not possible as their radio positions are only @xmath17 apart .",
    "however , the count rate observed from their position is roughly twice that of a typical msp in the sample and is , thus , consistent with being combined emisson from both msps .",
    "the net counts for most msps were obtained by subtracting the background rate , obtained from three source - free regions on the image , from the total .    in general ,",
    "the background noise in the energy range of interest was found to be very low ( @xmath151 background count per pixel over @xmath15260 ks of total exposure time ) .",
    "this was not the case for 47 tuc l , which is located very near the bright x - ray source x9 @xcite .",
    "the background for this msp was obtained by considering a section of an annulus of width @xmath22 around the positions of x9 , at the distance to l , while excluding the @xmath16 extraction circle around the msp . using this background region",
    "we find that @xmath1530% of the gross number of counts are due to x9 . for 47 tuc r , situated @xmath23 from the bright source w24 ,",
    "this procedure was not possible due to a combination of the smaller distance to w24 and the large pixel size of the acis detector .",
    "however , the distribution of counts within the @xmath16 extraction region of r suggests that w24 contributes with no more than 10% to the total counts . in the case of msp o ,",
    "the degree of contamination is difficult to gauge due to severe crowding .",
    "in addition , the x - ray counterpart of 47 tuc o , w39 , is very likely a blend of the msp and a variable source ( see  4 ) .",

    "to get a general sense of the x - ray properties of the msps , we have computed the hardness ratios hr1=(medium counts)/(soft counts ) and hr2=(hard counts)/(medium counts ) for each object and constructed an x - ray color - color diagram .",
    "the soft ( 0.30.6 kev ) , medium ( 0.61.5 kev ) , and hard ( 1.54 kev ) energy bands were selected so as to reduce the errors in hr2 , allowing us to discriminate between the two favored spectral models : thermal or non - thermal ( power - law ) .",
    "the net counts in the three bands for each msp are listed in table 1 , while the resulting x - ray color - color diagram is shown in figure 2 . for comparison ,",

    "the x - ray color - color diagram for the acis - s data ( fig .",
    "2 ) shows that , with the exception of 47 tuc j and w , the msps are indeed soft sources although the positions of the msps on the diagram are suggestive of a more complex spectrum , such as a composite thermal and non - thermal ( power - law ) spectrum or a multi - temperature thermal spectrum . as @xcite and @xcite argue , although consistent with the x - ray colors of the msps , a pure thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum is ruled out as it would require unrealistically large plasma densities , which would be inconsistent with the observed dispersion measures .",
    "the fivefold improvement in counting statistics , resulting from the longer exposure time and the better soft response of the acis - s compared to the acis - i observations , permits a more precise determination of the nature of the x - ray emission via spectral fitting for the 47 tuc msps . for this purpose",
    ", we used the total counts extracted for each msp from the four observations to generate source and background spectra , along with the corresponding response matrix and auxiliary files . the msp pairs 47 tuc f and s , and g and i , were treated as single sources as the individual spectra could not be separated . for the fainter msps",
    ", the extracted counts were grouped into energy bins containing at least 10 counts , while for the brighter msps each bin contained at least 15 counts .",
    "the subsequent least - squares fits to the spectra were performed using the xspec software package and were restricted to photon energies between 0.3 and 8 kev . in the fitting process",

    "the fits yielded effective temperatures and radii of @xmath242 k and @xmath243 km , respectively , while in the case of the nsa model we obtained @xmath244 k and @xmath245 km .",
    "tables 2 and 3 list the best fit model , the corresponding values for the fitted parameters , and the unabsorbed flux for each msp for the bb and nsa model fits , respectively .",
    "figure 3 shows representative thermal spectra for the 47 tuc msps .",
    "it is apparent from the values of @xmath246 listed in tables 2 and 3 , as well as figure 3 , that the spectra of several msps are poorly fit by a single temperature model , especially at energies above @xmath151.5 kev .",
    "in addition , we find the fits to be unacceptable for a pl or a composite pl+bb / pl+nsa model as well . motivated by the results for the nearby msps j04374715 @xcite and j0030 + 0451 @xcite we attempted fitting a two - temperature polar cap model to the brighter thermal - emitting 47 tuc msps , namely , d , e , l , and r. we found that a two - temperature spectrum can account for the excess at @xmath2471.5 kev apparent in figure 3 , resulting in an improved fit , although the limited count statistics do not allow us to reliably constrain the emission areas .",
    "nonetheless , if we fix the two temperatures to values comparable to those of j04374715 and j0030 + 0451 we obtain very similar results for the effective radii of the 47 tuc msps to those obtained for the two field msps .",
    "specifically , in the case of the nsa model , for @xmath248 k and @xmath249 k @xcite the fits yielded @xmath250 km and @xmath251 km , respectively , while for a bb model with @xmath252 k and @xmath253 k @xcite , we obtain @xmath254 m and @xmath255 m. if we extend the analogy further , it seems plausible that the thermal emission from all 47 tuc msps consists of two components as well .",
    "this imples that the derived values of @xmath256 and @xmath257 listed in tables 2 and 3 for the single component fit represent averages , weighted based on the relative temperatures and areas of the two emitting regions .        for the fainter msps , such as 47 tuc c , m ,",
    "n , q , and t , a pure power - law model , with a fairly steep spectrum ( @xmath258 ) , also yields an acceptable fit .",
    "however , we believe that this likely stems from the fact that a two - temperature spectrum appears power - law - like in the energy range of interest ( see e.g. fig . 2 in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we also note that a broken power - law model , with a break at @xmath259 kev , is also a good description of the observed emission from the 47 tuc msps . in principle",
    ", such a spectrum could arise due to a deficit of radiating high - energy particles in the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "a break in the spectrum is observed in young normal pulsars though at much higher energies ( a few gev , see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , evidence against a purely non - thermal model comes from optical observations of psr j0030 + 0451 , an msp with a qualitatively similar spectrum to those of the 47 tuc pulsars , which show that such a model grossly overestimates ( by a factor of @xmath15500 ) the optical flux upper limits when extrapolated to lower energies @xcite .    for the most luminous msps in the sample , namely 47 tuc j , o , and w , a composite nsa+pl or bb+pl model yields an acceptable fit , with the pl component contributing @xmath1570% , @xmath1550% , and @xmath1575% of the total flux , respectively",
    "the spectral fits , shown in figure 4 , were found to be acceptable for photon indices @xmath260 .",
    "we note that although an f - test does not indicate that a composite spectrum is statistically prefered over a pure pl ( but with a steeper photon index of @xmath261 ) , the fainter thermal component is very likely genuine , given that the inferred values for @xmath256 and @xmath257 are very similar to those of the other 47 tuc msps .",
    "the non - thermal x - rays from msp w , and probably msp j and o as well , most likely originate in an intrabinary shock ( see  4 ) although for j and o at least a portion of this emission may originate in the pulsar magnetosphere . for 47 tuc o , which is near the crowded center of the globular cluster",
    ", the pl component may also be due to a background x - ray source .",
    "the spectra of all other 47 tuc msps may , in fact , contain a faint magnetospheric emission component , which is undetectable in our observations due to the limited number of counts .",
    "it is important to note that , in order to model the nsa and bb spectra of msps properly , one needs to take into account the rotation of the ns , which induces a modulation in the projected area of the polar cap(s ) at the spin period and , in the case of a nsa , in the observed spectrum as well due to the energy dependence of the limb darkening effects of a ns atmosphere ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the derived temperatures and radii represent time - averaged values integrated over the rotation period of the pulsar . as a consequence , the spectral fits may underestimate the true flux by up to a factor of @xmath152 , even if we consider the effects of gravitational redshift and bending of light near the ns surface ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , in order to account for these effects , one requires prior knowledge of the relative orientation of the pulsar spin and magnetic axes and the line of sight , which is unavailable .",
    "although the limited time resolution of the acis - s observations ( 3.2 seconds ) precludes a timing analysis at the millisecond level , these observations in conjunction with the 2000 acis - i observations , permit us to investigate the temporal behavior of the msp emission over a large range of timescales from hours to years .    as expected , for the bulk of the sample we find no statistically significant x - ray variability .",
    "for msp o , however , there seems to be a gradual decrease in the photon count rate , by a factor of @xmath15@xmath262 in total , especially at medium energies ( 0.61.5 kev ) , from the second to the fourth acis - s observation .",
    "there is no known physical mechanism which could account for such a substantial variation of the flux on timescales of days from an old msp such as 47 tuc o. on the other hand , such behavior is typical of cataclysmic variables and chromospherically active binaries with @xmath2 ergs s@xmath3 .",
    "thus , we conclude that this variation is most likely due to blending of msp o with such an x - ray source .",
    "this seems likely as o is at the heart of the cluster ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , where the number density of x - ray sources is large .",
    "the msp r is found to be marginally variable between observations , while msp u exhibits possible variability within the third observation @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the apparent variability is likely spurious considering the probability of spurious detection and the number ( 19 ) of trials .",
    "for the 12 binary msps , we can also examine whether there exist any variations in the x - ray flux as a function of orbital position . in this sense , 47 tuc j , o , r , and w are of particular interest as they are in very compact binaries with periods of 2.9 , 3.3 , 1.6 , and 3.2 hours , respectively .",
    "the former three msps are bound to very low mass degenerate companions ( @xmath263 m@xmath95 ) and are eclipsed regularly at radio wavelengths for 10 - 25% of their orbits @xcite .",
    "msp w , on the other hand , has a significantly more massive ( @xmath264 m@xmath95 ) main - sequence secondary @xcite and undergoes eclipses for about 3540% of the entire orbit @xcite . for this analysis ,",
    "the observations for the binary msps were first folded at the binary period using the latest values for the orbital periods @xmath265 and the epochs of ascending node @xmath266 ( * ? ? ? * freire et al .",
    "unpublished data ) .",
    "the net counts were then grouped in phase bins sized so as to allow detection of any large - amplitude variations in the x - ray photon count rate at the eclipse phases .",
    "for the same purpose , we also performed kolmogorov - smirnov and cramer - von mises tests on the folded but unbinned data , using an integer number of binary orbits .    for 47 tuc j ,",
    "o , and r we find no detectable variation in the x - ray count rate at any orbital phase and are only able to set very crude upper limits on the amplitude of variation of @xmath26760 - 80% .",
    "in contrast , 47 tuc w exhibits dramatic variations in the x - ray flux ( significant at the 99.9% level ) as a function of orbital phase . this behavior can be naturally explained by the existence of a swept - back shocked stream of gas formed by interaction of the pulsar wind with matter from the irradiated companion issuing through the inner lagrange point .",

    "however , the fact that msps with @xmath319 ergs s@xmath3 appear to have thermal spectra , whereas those with @xmath320 ergs s@xmath3 show strong non - thermal emission , suggests a profound difference in the conditions in the pulsar magnetosphere ( see  6.3 ) .",
    "next , we consider how @xmath4 depends on the pulsar magnetic field as it governs the physical processes responsible both for magnetospheric emission , polar cap heating , and , to some degree , shock emission . in figure @xmath321 , we plot @xmath4 versus @xmath322 g , the magnetic field at the light cylinder ( @xmath323 ) for a simple dipole .",

    "first , it is important to emphasize that the x - ray luminosities plotted in figures 5 and 6 represent observed , not true quantities .",
    "this is especially critical for the non - thermal magnetospheric emission , which is subject to beaming and , hence , viewing angle effects .",
    "therefore , the measured value of @xmath4 may greatly underestimate the true x - ray luminosity . as for the thermal emission , a major source of uncertainty",
    "is introduced by the lack of knowledge of the masses and radii of the sample of msps .",
    "these parameters affect @xmath4 through the gravitational redshift and bending of light . in particular , the true thermal luminosity , as measured at the ns surface , is larger by a factor of @xmath335 than the luminosity measured by a distant observer . in our analysis ,",
    "we have corrected for this effect by assuming the canonical values of @xmath336 m@xmath95 and @xmath337 km . however , for a reasonable range of ns masses , 1.2 - 2.3 m@xmath95 , based on the results of @xcite and @xcite , we find that the true @xmath4 may differ from the value used here by up to a factor of @xmath151.8 .",
    "in addition , for ns radii in the range @xmath338 km , the derived @xmath300 may deviate from the true value by @xmath26720% .",
    "the parameters @xmath306 , @xmath332 , and @xmath333 also depend on the msp mass and radius , as @xmath339 and @xmath340 .",
    "for the same range of ns masses ( @xmath341 m@xmath95 ) , the assumption of 1.4 m@xmath95 may result in a deviation of up to @xmath1560% for @xmath306 and @xmath1525% for @xmath342 and @xmath333 , from the true values .",
    "this implies that a spread in masses within the sample of msps would tend to increase the scatter about the derived relations in both coordinates ( e.g. @xmath300 and @xmath306 ) and perhaps result in a skewed trend .",
    "conversely , for a sample of msps that have very similar masses but are systematically more or less massive than the canonical 1.4 m@xmath95 , the result will be an offset in the derived intercept , with little effect on the slope of the log - log relation under consideration ( e.g. @xmath343 ) . as for @xmath344 , for the range @xmath338 km we find that @xmath306 , @xmath332 , and @xmath333 may differ by up to a factor of @xmath152.6 .",
    "the effect of the ns radius on the scatter in the trends discussed above is uncertain due to lack of knowledge of the true ns equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "for instance , in certain theoretical models of the ns eos a small change in @xmath345 does not result in an appreciable change in @xmath344 , while for others the opposite is the case ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "for the 47 tuc msp , the parameters derived from @xmath308 are subject to an additional uncertainty arising from lack of knowledge of the magnitude of acceleration of the msps by the gravitational potential of the globular cluster .",
    "it is important to note that the model - dependent values derived for @xmath309 are sensitive to the assumptions made regarding the gravitational potential and gas density profile of the cluster . for simplicity , in this paper",
    "we have derived @xmath309 for each msp assuming a simple constant gas density profile .",
    "however , it is likely that in reality the gas distribution of 47 tuc is more complex .",
    "for instance , the nearly identical dispersion measures of the msps near the cluster center , namely 47 tuc f , l , o , and s @xcite , may be interpreted as being due to the presence of a cavity in the plasma around the cluster core carved out by the winds of these pulsars .",
    "hence , obtaining accurate values of @xmath309 may require implementation of more elaborate models of the gas distribution , which will be explored in detail elsewhere .",
    "another potential source of systematic uncertainty is the presence of an observational selection effect .",
    "it is probable that so far pulsar observations have sampled only the most luminous and nearby msps .",
    "the existence of x - ray faint msps , both in globular clusters and the field of the galaxy , would mean that the observed narrow range of @xmath300 for the msps with thermal spectra is simply an artifact of the limited sample of very low luminosity msps .",
    "given the large uncertainties discussed above , any conclusions drawn for the apparent relations between @xmath4 and quantities derived from the pulsar spin parameters should be taken with much caution , as it is not possible , at present , to properly account for all effects that act to modify the observed trends .",
    "the spectral fits described in  3 show that the majority of 47 tuc msps exhibit emission consistent with a thermal model , with no indication of any magnetospheric emission .",
    "it is probable that the msps with seemingly purely thermal emission do , in fact , have a fainter magnetospheric x - ray component ( @xmath276@xmath346 ergs s@xmath3 ) .",
    "however , it remains unclear what determines the relative strengths of these two x - ray production mechanisms .",
    "although viewing angle dependences and beaming of the magnetospheric radiation can explain why thermal emission dominates in many msps , it is more likely that the relative strength of the two components is determined by the poorly understood details of the magnetospheric emission and polar cap heating mechanisms .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have raised the possibility that the very narrow range of thermal luminosities and small emission areas imply the existence of a strong multipole magnetic field near the surface . however , the small range in @xmath334 _ is _ consistent with a simple dipole field if one considers general relativistic effects near the surface . in particular ,",
    "gravitational bending of light causes @xmath34775% of the ns surface to be visible at any given time ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as a consequence , the degree of modulation in the flux which arises due to rotation of the ns is greatly reduced .",
    "this , in turn , diminishes the scatter in @xmath4 for the sample of msps that would otherwise result from different orientations of the magnetic and spin axes relative to the line of sight .",
    "thus , although entirely plausible , the existence of a multipole magnetic field need not be invoked to account for the small range in @xmath4 .",
    "we note that the inferred radii of the thermally emitting areas obtained in  3 are indeed somewhat smaller than the expected size of a magnetic polar cap for a simple dipole field , @xmath348 ( e.g. , @xmath349 km for a 3 ms pulsar ) .",
    "this likely arises due to the fact that we have fitted most msp spectra with a single temperature model , where in reality a two - temperature model is more appropriate , as suggested by the results of  3 . in adittion ,",
    "due to variation of the projected area of the polar caps , induced by the rotation of the star , fits to the time - integrated spectrum result in an underestimate of the effective emission area .",
    "however , even with a two temperature spectrum and a correction factor for the effective area , in the case of a bb model the total emitting region is still substantially smaller than the expected polar cap area .",
    "if the ns surface does , in fact , radiate like a blackbody , this discrepancy may be indicative of either non - uniform polar cap heating or deviations from a pure dipole field .",
    "for instance , the polar cap model of harding & muslimov predicts that the heating rate by positrons should be highest near the rim of the polar cap ( cf .",
    "fig . 7 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , resulting in an annulus - shaped emitting region with an area significantly smaller than that of the entire polar cap .",
    "@xcite have argued that a small emission area can arise if the msp is an aligned rotator , resulting in a so - called `` squeezed '' polar cap .",
    "the outer gap model of @xcite also predicts that the heated area should be significantly smaller than the whole polar cap due to the presence of a small scale multipole field near the surface .",
    "finally , this result may imply that a blackbody is simply not a valid approximation of the ns surface .",
    "the discrepancy may , thus , be a consequence of the fact that simplified blackbody models result in higher derived temperatures and smaller emission areas due to the fact that the x - ray spectra of light - element atmospheres are harder than blackbody spectra @xcite .",
    "the results of this study as well as recent _ chandra _ and _",
    "xmm - newton _ observations of nearby field msps @xcite have revealed that there are no clear systematic differences between the x - ray properties of globular cluster and field msps , which could arise , for instance , due to different evolutionary paths .",
    "for example , the nearby field msps such as j04374715 and j0030 + 0451 , are quite similar to the bulk of 47 tuc msps in terms of x - ray luminosity and spectral properties .",
    "also , b182124 in the globular cluster m28 , is akin to b1937 + 21 , characterized by large x - ray and spindown luminosities ( @xmath350 ergs s@xmath3 , @xmath351 ergs s@xmath3 ) , hard non - thermal spectra , and very narrow radio and x - ray pulse profiles @xcite .",
    "these similarities imply that if , in fact , multiple binary exchanges and accretion episodes occur for globular cluster msps , they may not significantly alter the elementary emission properties of the pulsar .",
    "@xcite have shown that the binary msp 47 tuc w exhibits large - amplitude x - ray variability at the binary period .",
    "this modulation can be interpreted as being due to geometric occultations of an x - ray emitting intrabinary shock by the @xmath150.15 m@xmath95 main - sequence companion . on the other hand , in the three other systems in which radio eclipses are observed , namely 47 tuc j , o , and r",
    ", we detect no such variability .",
    "the persistence of x - ray emission during the radio eclipses confirms that at radio frequencies j , o , and r are not eclipsed by their respective binary companions but rather by a tenuous ionized envelope formed due to mass loss by the companion driven by the pulsar wind , as in the case of psrs b1957 + 20 and j20510827 @xcite .    the unique x - ray behavior of 47 tuc w is most certainly the result of the presence of a main - sequence secondary star instead of the typical very - low mass ( @xmath150.03 m@xmath95 ) degenerate companion found in `` black widow''-like systems such as j , o , and r. while the latter three systems are expected end products of low - mass x - ray binary evolution , 47 tuc w is likely the result of an exchange encounter in which the original very low - mass companion was ejected from the binary ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "however , even if the current companion of msp w is roche - lobe filling , the existence of an intrabinary shock implies that another accretion phase can not commence as the energetic pulsar wind is constraining the outflow of mass from the companion ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "in  5 we have found that the @xmath352 relation for the thermally emitting msps has a slope of @xmath8 .",
    "although such a trend is consistent with the prediction of the polar cap heating model of @xcite , @xmath9 , we can not exclude the possibility that the 47 tuc msps follow the linear @xmath353 relation .    despite the large uncertainties , for the present sample of msps detected in x - rays we still observe a general trend of decrease of @xmath4 as a function of spin down luminosity and magnetic field strength .",
    "if these parameters are , in turn , determined by the age of the msp , it is tempting to speculate that figures 5 and 6 represent evolutionary diagrams .",
    "here we consider a possible evolutionary path of a msp described within the framework of the @xcite electron - positron ( @xmath354 ) pair production model .",
    "for relatively young and energetic msps , such as psr b182124 ( @xmath355 yr ) , @xmath354 pairs are produced via curvature radiation ( cr ) .",
    "these pairs , in turn , produce the observable x - ray/@xmath356-ray and radio non - thermal magnetospheric emission . although some polar cap heating by a backflow of energetic particles may occur in these objects , the non - thermal component ( @xmath15@xmath357 ergs s@xmath3 ) is several orders of magnitude brighter , making it difficult to observe any emission from the polar caps .",
    "as the msp ages , it undergoes rotational spindown and perhaps magnetic field decay , which result in a decline in the cr pair production rate . at a certain stage ,",
    "the magnetic field becomes too low to permit cr pair production so inverse compton scattering ( ics ) of soft x - rays by accelerated electrons becomes an important channel for @xmath354 pair production .",
    "ics pair production results in substantial polar cap heating by a backflow of positrons from the magnetosphere .",
    "since the polar cap heating rate has a weaker dependence on the spindown luminosity ( @xmath358 ) than magnetospheric emission ( @xmath359 ) , the thermal emission will eventually become dominant over the magnetospheric emission , as is observed in the majority of 47 tuc msps and many field msps .",
    "at much later times , the msp is expected to cross the ics pair production death line ( see fig . 1 in * ? ? ? * ) and will no longer be observable as a pulsar , both in the radio and x - ray . in the end , as the polar caps cool , the msp will fade away from view at x - ray energies as well .",
    "we have presented a spectral analysis of the x - ray emission for the complete sample of known msps in 47 tuc .",
    "the x - ray spectra of the majority of msps are well described by a thermal model , a bb or a ns hydrogen atmosphere , with @xmath360 k , @xmath361 km , and @xmath2 ergs s@xmath3 ( 0.38 kev ) .",
    "the small observed scatter in the thermal @xmath4 is consistent with a simple dipole magnetic field configuration .",
    "a two temperature thermal model , reminiscent of that observed from some nearby field msps , is also consistent with the emission from the bulk of 47 tuc msps and , in some cases , results in an improved fit .",
    "such a spectrum could arise due to non - uniform polar cap heating or lateral diffusion of heat accross the ns surface away from the regions directly heated by particles from the magnetosphere .",
    "the msps j , o , and w show a prominent non - thermal component in their spectra .",
    "at least part of the non - thermal x - rays are very likely due to interaction of the relativistic particle wind of the pulsar with matter from the companion .",
    "all other 47 tuc msps exhibit no evidence of a significant non - thermal x - ray component .",
    "our re - examination of the @xmath325 relation has revealed that regardless of the emission mechanism responsible for production of the observed x - rays , the conversion efficiency of @xmath306 to @xmath4 appears to be , in all cases , @xmath15@xmath362 .",
    "all of the 47 tuc msps , with the exception of 47 tuc w , display no large amplitude variability in their x - ray emission on timescales of days , weeks , and years .",
    "the msp w exhibits dramatic variations at the binary period , which can be attributed to the presence of an intrabinary shock that is eclipsed by the secondary star .",
    "the lack of long term variations in the flux of most msps could potentially serve as a criterion for classification of unidentified soft x - ray sources @xcite .",
    "given that most of the @xmath15@xmath363 msps presently known have spin parameters similar to those of the 47 tuc msps , we expect many of them to have predominantly thermal x - ray spectra .",
    "moreover , for these msps , gravitational bending of light near the ns surface ensures that at least one of the antipodal heated polar caps is always observable , while for a wide range of angles between the magnetic and spin axes and the line of sight both polar caps are visible simultaneously for a large portion of the msp spin period ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this effect invariably results in a 100% duty cycle , even if the magnetospheric emission beams never sweep across the earth or if the radio emission is very faint or heavily absorbed / scattered .",
    "therefore , many msps with heated polar caps may , in principle , be detectable at x - ray energies even if they can not be observed as radio pulsars .",
