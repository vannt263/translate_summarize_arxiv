    "it was argued that the objects must be physically associated with ngc 1068 and probably ejected from it @xcite .",
    "evidence for the ejection of objects from a central source has been claimed previously when two objects are found to lie on opposite sides of , and to be equally spaced from , the central object @xcite . the simplest interpretation",
    "may then be that the objects have similar masses and were ejected in the same event .",
    "it is also well known that matter is ejected from the nucleus of active galaxies and radio galaxies in jets directed along the rotation axis . in several previous cases evidence",
    "has been presented that suggests compact objects have also been ejected along the rotation axis of the parent galaxy @xcite . in ngc 1068 the rotation axis , and inner jet , can be represented by a north - south line passing through the galaxy @xcite .    in most of the above cases",
    "the redshifts of the compact objects have been found to decrease with increasing distance from the parent object .",
    "this paper first examines the source position and redshift data for the fourteen qsos near ngc 1068 in an attempt to determine if an ejection model can explain them .",

    "the redshifts and magnitudes of the compact objects , as well as their angular distances from ngc 1068 , are listed in table 1 and have been taken from @xcite .",

    "1 the measured redshift of each object is plotted vs its angular separation from ngc 1068 . it is apparent from this plot that there are at least four separate groups of sources whose component objects lie at roughly the same distance from the galaxy .",
    "the four source groups fall within the boxes indicated in the figure ( labeled a , b , c , and d ) and each contains three sources .",
    "since redshifts have not been measured for sources 9,10 , and 12 , their angular separations from ngc 1068 have been indicated only by vertical dashed lines in fig .",

    "if the objects have been ejected from ngc 1068 in separate events this is exactly what one might expect .",
    "1 is therefore interpreted here as indicating that at least four groups of sources have been ejected from ngc 1068 in separate ejection events .",
    "the sources ejected in each event are defined unambiguously by the boxes in fig .",
    "the triplet lying furthest from ngc 1068 ( box a ) is assumed to have been ejected first with close - in triplets being ejected in subsequent events .",
    "what follows is an interpretation of the data within the framework of the ejection model defined by fig",
    "since the three sources making up each of the triplets defined by the boxes in fig . 1 all lie at approximately the same distance from ngc 1068 , their component sources must fall close to a circle centered near the galaxy . in fig .",
    "2 the position of each source @xcite is plotted relative to the position r.a.@xmath7 ; dec@xmath8 .",
    "this choice of reference position is arbitrary and was only chosen to simplify calculations .",

    "four concentric circles , labeled a , b , c , and d as in fig . 1 , have been superimposed on the figure .",
    "although the sources in each triplet fall close to the circles , the fit is poor , especially in the larger triplets .",
    "however , if the objects in each triplet all lay at the same radial distance from ngc 1068 , they would only fall on concentric circles if they were all ejected in the plane of the sky , perpendicular to the line - of - sight ( l - o - s ) .",
    "it is highly unlikely that this would be the case .",
    "it is more likely that the ejection planes would be oriented either at different angles to the l - o - s , or at least at some angle other than 90@xmath9 .",
    "if so , they would fall on concentric ellipses .    in fig . 3 ,",
    "four concentric ellipses centered near ngc 1068 have been superimposed on the data in fig .",
    "2 . the fit is now excellent , even in the large triplets .",
    "the sources making up each triplet , defined by the boxes in fig . 1 , are a(1,3,14 ) , b(2,5,13 ) , c(4,6,12 ) , and d(8,11,10 ) where source numbers have been taken from table 1 .",
    "sources 7 and 9 have not been fitted to a concentric ellipse but the possibility that one , or both , may be part of a fifth triplet can not be ruled out .    also evident in fig .",
    "3 is the fact that in each triplet , one object ( hereafter referred to as the singlet ) lies on the east of the rotation axis while the midpoint of the remaining two ( hereafter referred to as the pair ) is located a similar distance to the west .",
    "pairs are shown joined by a solid line and the relevant singlet is connected to each pair by dashed lines .",
    "heavy solid lines also identify pairs in fig .",
    "it is worth noting that the mean redshift of the pairs falls off approximately linearly with increasing distance from the seyfert galaxy .",
    "this fall - off with increasing distance , indicated by the dotted line in fig .",
    "1 , is similar to what has been found for compact objects near other active galaxies . in fig .",
    "3 the source positions on the sky are too close to allow an unambiguous choice for the singlet in triplet d ( it could be source 10 or 11 ) .",
    "it is obvious from fig .",
    "1 , however , that the mean redshift of sources 11 and 8 falls on the dotted line and these two sources are therefore assumed to define the pair . whether a redshift fall - off with distance is also true for the singlets can not yet be determined since redshifts have not been measured for source 10 and 12 .    the heavy solid line connecting from each singlet to each pair midpoint in fig .",
    "3 gives the triplet s position angle @xmath10 , ( where @xmath10 is measured counterclockwise on the sky , or east , from north ) .",
    "the midpoints of these heavy lines , ( indicated by the dotted curve in fig .",
    "2 ) , are assumed to represent the center of mass points of the triplets ( simply because the singlets and pair midpoints are equally spaced on either side of the rotation axis ) .",
    "they fall along a curve that is closely aligned with the rotation axis , the minor axis of the central torus @xcite and the inner radio jet @xcite and counter - jet .",
    "although the center of mass points do not coincide exactly with the rotation axis , their departure from it varies smoothly from triplet a to d and this departure can be explained if ngc 1068 itself has some proper motion perpendicular to the l - o - s over the time period covered by the ejection events .",
    "( this is discussed in detail in a later paper ) .",
    "the n - s offset between the galaxy and each triplet s center of mass , whether in the jet or counter - jet direction , is assumed to indicate that component of the triplet s motion , resulting from its respective ejection event , that is directed along the rotation axis and perpendicular to the l - o - s . in fig .",
    "4 the sources in each triplet have been re - plotted after removing the n - s offsets of their respective centers of mass .",
    "the plot shows the relative triplet orientation more clearly .",
    "each triplet is identified by an a , b , c , or d adjacent to its associated pair .",
    "the triplet position angle @xmath10 and related rotation angle @xmath11 ( defined below ) rotate smoothly about the rotation axis in a counter - clockwise direction from a to d ( again this continuous rotation for triplets a to d is achieved only if source 10 is chosen for the singlet in triplet d ) .",
    "this rotation direction is the same as the galaxy rotation direction and may suggest that the triplet position angle is fixed relative to the co - ordinates of the central object .",
    "the change in triplet position angle is thus a measure of the rotation of the central object .",
    "this possibility is used below to estimate the rotation period of the central object .    in all four triplets in fig .",
    "4 , the pair orientation angle @xmath12 ( defined by the position angle on the sky of the line connecting between the two sources in each pair ) rotates continuously with the triplet position angle @xmath10 and , in so doing , maintains a similar orientation relative to the singlet / pair midpoint / rotation axis plane . in effect , all four triplets are similarly structured , differing only in their rotation angles and sizes . to obtain this result by chance seems extremely unlikely if it is remembered that the sources in each triplet were identified in fig . 1 simply because they lay at similar distances from ngc 1068 , and that the internal consistency achieved here requires fitting both source positions and redshifts in all four triplets .",
    "_ for the source position and redshift data to lead to the same singlet - pair structure in each triplet that rotates smoothly about the rotation axis in the same direction that the galaxy rotates , and which is at the same time correlated with triplet size , has to be quite remarkable _ .",
    "the fact that each triplet s center of mass falls along the rotation axis of the central object is equally remarkable . _ _    the simple assumption in fig .",
    "1 , that the groups of sources lying approximately equidistant from ngc 1068 have been ejected from the galaxy in separate events , has thus lead to a detailed ejection model with the following characteristics :    \\a ) each event ejects three compact objects ( a triplet ) along the rotation axis ( in either the jet or counter - jet direction ) from a point near the center of ngc 1068 .",

    "the age of triplet a can be used together with the mean angular displacement of its sources from ngc 1068 ( table 2 , col 6 ) to calculate the proper motion .",
    "this is found to be @xmath60 milliarcsec per yr which would be difficult to detect even if observations were spaced over many years .",
    "\\g ) progenitor configuration .",
    "this paper has examined the position and redshift data of the compact objects near ngc 1068 as they currently exist and no attempt has been made to determine their configuration prior to ejection . although it may be premature to speculate on what the progenitor source configuration might have been , there are some things that are worth noting . in fig .",
    "4 the position angle of the paired sources ( @xmath61 can be seen to rotate smoothly from a to d , ending up approximately perpendicular to the present position of the rotation axis and aligned with the major axis of the central torus . if this change is produced by a simultaneous change in the tip of the rotation axis with time the present position angles of the pairs are at least consistent with the possibility that they all originally orbited in the major axis plane of the galaxy .",
    "since the paired sources have equal - and - opposite spectral shifts ( z@xmath21 ) , it is argued here that prior to ejection each pair was an orbiting binary .",
    "note that the z@xmath21 values ( as high as z = 0.37 in pair d ) are too large to be explained as components of the modest ejection velocities and seem more likely to be residual orbital velocities . also , in fig .",

    "the blueshifted pair members ( 1,2,4,8 ) all lie west of the redshifted members ( 3,5,6,11 ) , and any proposed progenitor configuration must be able to explain this .",
    "it is of interest to note that if the displacements of the pair midpoints from the galaxy are removed , all the blueshifted objects fall on the west of the galaxy , and the redshifted ones on the east .",

    "until the redshifts of sources 10 and 12 can be measured it will not be possible to determine the size of the intrinsic component of z@xmath20 , since this redshift component will also contain a component due to the n - s , l - o - s triplet ejection velocity ( if @xmath62 ) .",
    "however , that component can be estimated to be at least as high as z = 0.6 ( for @xmath63 ) .",
    "these results do allow the redshift of source 12 to be roughly estimated for a future test of the model .",
    "since sources 10 and 12 are both moving toward us in the model , their redshifts must be less than the z@xmath20 values of their respective pairs .",
    "if the intrinsic redshift component of z@xmath20 is equal to that of its associated singlet , as assumed above , then the redshifts of 10 and 12 should differ from z = 1.2 and 1.1 , respectively , by twice their l - o - s ejection velocities .",
    "this difference will be small if the radial ejection velocities are similar to those found for the singlets in triplets a and b. the redshift of source 12 is estimated here to be z = 0.63@xmath64 using the estimated triplet age and the angular separation of the singlet from the rotation axis .",
    "no attempt has been made to estimate a value for the redshift of source 10 because the angular distances involved are too small to estimate accurately .",
    "if the four triplets defined by the boxes in fig . 1 , whose component sources all lie at a similar distance from ngc 1068 , have been ejected from the galaxy in separate events , it has been shown that the present positions of the sources on the sky can lead to a detailed , reasonable , internally consistent ejection model .",
    "for the source position and redshift data to lead to the same singlet - pair structure in each of the four triplets , that rotates smoothly about the rotation axis in the same direction that the galaxy rotates , and which is , at the same time , correlated with the triplet size and age , is remarkable . for the triplet ejection direction to lie along the rotation axis of the galaxy ,",
    "the one direction most closely associated with the ejection of matter from and active galaxy , is equally remarkable .",
    "this suggests strongly that the objects have been ejected from ngc 1068 .",
    "however , the modest ejection velocities found indicate that a significant component of the measured redshifts must be intrinsic .",
    "the consequences of this conclusion are enormous .",

    "<S> an examination of the positions and redshifts of the compact , qso - like objects reported near the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 1068 has revealed many relationships that suggest strongly that the objects have been ejected from the galaxy . although some of the same relations have been found for the compact objects near ngc 3516 , the higher number of sources near ngc 1068 has resulted in a detailed physical model . </S>",
    "<S> the results indicate that the objects have been expelled in at least four similarly structured ejection events from a point near the centre of ngc 1068 within the last 6@xmath0 yrs and with very modest velocities [ l - o - s components @xmath1 km s@xmath2 . from the age and rotation angle of successive events , </S>",
    "<S> the rotation period of the central object is calculated to be @xmath3 yrs , in good agreement with the nuclear rotation period obtained from kinematic studies of ngc 1068 . </S>",
    "<S> the large redshifts of the objects can not be explained by their modest ejection velocities and require an additional , large intrinsic component . </S>"
