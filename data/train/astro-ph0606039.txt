    "after a few hundred million years , a planetary system is expected to have assumed its final configuration and has either set the stage for life , or will probably remain barren forever .",
    "it is difficult to probe this era .",
    "most of its traces have been obliterated in the solar system .",
    "only a minority of the nearby stars are so young . even for them , planets  and particularly those in the terrestrial planet / asteroidal region  are faint and are lost in the glare of their central stars . however , when bodies in this zone collide , they initiate cascades of further collisions among the debris and between it and other members of the system , eventually grinding a significant amount of material into dust grains distributed in a so - called debris disk . because the grains have larger surface area per unit mass compared to larger bodies , they ( re)radiate more energy and therefore are more easily detected in the ir compared to their parent bodies . by studying this signal , we can probe the evolution of other planetary systems through this early , critical stage .",
    "debris disks are found around stars generally older than @xmath210 myr , with no signs of gas accretion ( as judged from the absence of emission lines or uv excess ) @xcite . in the absence of gas drag , a 10 micron - size dust grain from the primordial",
    ", protoplanetary nebula can not survive longer than @xmath2 1 myr within 10 @xmath3 of a star due to a number of clearing processes , like sublimation , radiation pressure , poynting - robertson and stellar wind drag @xcite . therefore , any main sequence star older than 10 myr with an infrared excess is a candidate to have circumstellar material supplied through debris disk processes .    in our solar system",
    "there are two main sources of dust : colliding asteroids and evaporating comets .",
    "the dust ( grains @xmath4 1 mm in size ) is concentrated in two belts  the asteroid belt at 2 - 3.5 @xmath3 , @xmath5 @xmath6 @xcite ; and the kuiper belt at 30 - 50 @xmath3 ,",
    "@xmath7 @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "asteroid collisions that produce warm dust are driven by perturbations by planets , a process that has cleared most of the interplanetary material from the inner 30 @xmath3 of the system .",
    "in contrast , there is substantial mass in the kuiper belt , concentrated in reasonably stable structures controlled by giant planets @xcite .",
    "similarly , rings , blobs , warps and other non - uniformities are frequently observed in the spatially resolved images of nearby extrasolar debris disks and inferred from the spectral energy distributions in the distant unresolved disks , implying the presence of _ planetary mass bodies _ in these systems .",
    "the first debris disks were discovered by _ iras _ in the 1980s .",
    "only a handful of nearby ones have been resolved in optical and near - ir scattered light or detected in submm thermal emission ; _ iso _ has extended the _ iras _ results , but only to a modest extent ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the limited sensitivity of _ iras _ and _ iso _ and the even more severe limitations of other methods have prevented a complete census , particularly to photospheric emission levels .",
    "in addition , some alleged disks have been confused with background objects or cirrus in the large beam of _ iras_. the attempt to assess the percentage of stars with debris - disk emission therefore appeared premature from pre-_spitzer _ data @xcite .    with superior sensitivity and a smaller beam size , _",
    "spitzer _ is providing many new insights to debris disk behavior .",
    "for example , @xcite demonstrated both the overall decline of debris disks with age ( first noted in @xcite ) and the large scatter of disk properties at any given age ( as previously noted in @xcite ) . by probing excesses to within 25% of the photospheric emission",
    ", @xcite found a surprising number of non - excess stars even at ages as young as 10 - 20 myr , implying very rapid clearing of the inner @xmath9 region in these systems .",
    "the study of rieke et al .",
    "was purposely confined to a stars , with masses @xmath10 .",
    "it poses the question of whether the same patterns of disk evolution hold for less massive stars , especially in the _ solar _ mass range  spectral types fgk .",
    "the study of excesses in young solar analogs could corroborate lunar geological evidence of the bombardment history in the solar system .",
    "two major surveys of solar type stars in the field are under way with _",
    "spitzer _  the solar star survey by the mips gto team , searching for disks around @xmath2150 field stars within 25 pc @xcite , and the legacy survey by the feps group , searching for disks around @xmath2330 stars , both field and members of nearby open clusters and associations @xcite .",
    "interpretation of these surveys is still in progress ; nevertheless , preliminary results indicate that among solar analogs typically older than 1 gyr @xmath210 - 15% have excess emission at 70 @xmath0 m , indicative of kuiper belt analogs @xmath210 - 100 times more massive than in the solar system @xcite . on the other hand , 24 @xmath0 m excesses that would be indicative of massive zodiacal belts are much more rare around these stars ",
    "@xmath21% @xcite .    to explore younger systems with good number statistics and small uncertainties in age determination ,",
    "an open cluster survey has been initiated by the mips and irac gto groups .",
    "the first clusters studied in this program were the 25 - 35 myr old ngc 2547 @xcite and the 60 - 100 myr old m47 ( ngc 2422 ) @xcite .",
    "at 24 @xmath0 m photospheres were detected in ngc 2547 down to mid - f and in m 47 to early g spectral types , beginning to probe disks in the solar - mass regime . a decrease with age in both the amount and the fraction of excess ( from @xmath240% to 25% )",
    "is indicated for b - a stars between the two clusters ( as included in rieke et al .",
    "2005 ) . for f - k stars a similar trend",
    "is only suggested : quantitative estimates are impossible because photospheres start dropping below the detection limit .",
    "thus , it is not clear whether the high incidence of 24 @xmath0 m excesses around a stars is a product of their high luminosities and efficiency in heating dust , or simply results because they are by definition relatively young ( @xmath4 1 gyr ) .    to probe the evolution of debris disks around solar - mass stars",
    ", we have investigated the pleiades .",
    "the pleiades is one of the best studied clusters with membership extending into the substellar regime ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at 24 @xmath0 m _ spitzer _",
    "is potentially sensitive enough to detect photospheres in this cluster down to early m spectral type . to exploit these advantages",
    ", one must contend with an interstellar cloud of gas and dust , whose thermal emission beyond 10 @xmath0 m dominates over starlight in the south - west part of the cluster .",
    "there is no consistent picture of the structure and kinematics of this nebulosity , except that it might be a part of the @xmath210 myr taurus - auriga starforming complex through or behind which the pleiades happens to be passing at the present epoch ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "recent studies however agree that at least some of the material is located within the cluster and possibly interacts with the brightest members @xcite .",
    "dust in the molecular cloud is sheared by the radiation pressure and assembles into filaments that wrap around stars , forming a characteristic pattern of reflection nebulosity known as the `` pleiades phenomenon '' @xcite .",
    "the unresolved thermal emission from the interstellar dust shell can mimic emission from a debris disk , as was for example demonstrated with coronagraphic imaging of the _ _ iras-__selected vega - like stars by @xcite .",
    "special measures were undertaken in our survey to avoid confusion with interstellar dust (  [ red],[sample ] ) .",
    "pre-_spitzer _ ir and submm @xcite searches for pleiades disks were largely unsuccessful .",
    "the few reported detections by _ iras _ @xcite and _ msx _",
    "@xcite concern the brightest b type members , which we find to be either surrounded by heavy cirrus or emission line stars with gaseous disks .",
    "@xcite observed 14 low mass members with _",
    "iso _ , and claim detection ( and excesses ) at 60 and/or 90 @xmath0 m in the two g0 and k2 members hii 1132 and hii 3163 .",
    "the fractional dust luminosity in these stars , if accurate , is unusually high  about @xmath11 , comparable to the transitional disks found around @xmath1210 myr - old stars .",
    "unfortunately both stars are outside of our _ spitzer _ fields .",
    "recently @xcite within the framework of the feps project investigated 19 solar - type members outside of the cluster core .",
    "they found excess emission at 24 @xmath0 m at levels up to 40% above the photosphere in a few members .",
    "compared to the feps study , ours is centered on the cluster core , covers a larger area , and considers all members independent of spectral type or binarity .",
    "it is a magnitude- and background - limited survey based on the membership derived from the optical studies .",
    "for the first time , it provides adequate number statistics to constrain the disk incidence around pleiades members similar in mass to the sun .",
    "the pleiades were imaged with the mips instrument in the scan map mode with half - pixel subsampling @xcite .",
    "one area of size @xmath13 was centered on the cluster core , as defined by the `` seven sisters '' ( the brightest b - type members ) and the associated reflection nebula .",
    "it was observed in two segments in february 2004 .",
    "another field of size @xmath14 , centered approximately @xmath15 north of the cluster core , was observed in september 2004 .",
    "all the observations were done using medium scan mode with half - array cross - scan overlap , resulting in a total effective exposure time per point at 24 @xmath0 m of 80 seconds .",
    "the 24 @xmath0 m images were processed using the mips instrument team data analysis tool , which calibrates the data and applies a distortion correction to each individual exposure @xcite .",
    "we further applied a column - dependent median subtraction routine to remove a small residual dark latent pattern from individual images before combining into a final mosaic .",
    "data at 70 and 160 @xmath0 m were taken simultaneously ; however , the images yielded no detections of interest to this study because of the sensitivity limits and strong background cirrus , and we will not discuss them further .",
    "the thermal emission from the nebula is strongest in the west side of the cluster , where the ism cloud is of highest density as indicated by the enhanced extinction , polarization and detection of co gas @xcite .",
    "this highly non - uniform nebulosity limits our ability to perform photometry on the faint sources in the central field to only those that are situated in the clean gaps between the the bright filaments .",
    "the northern field contains fewer members , being further from the cluster core , but it has the most uniform background .",
    "we performed photometry independently on each field , which allowed us to evaluate the uncertainty of our photometry based on the objects from the overlapping regions @xmath16-wide .",
    "the full area of our survey is shown in fig .",
    "the image was created by merging all three fields with the iraf task ` imcombine ` , after applying appropriate offsets to account for the different levels of zodiacal light in each field .",
    "stars marked in the figure outside the map boundaries are from @xcite .",
    "the complicated background required an investigation of the optimum way of doing photometry .",
    "we carried out two tests to find parameters that provide the most accurate results for aperture and psf - fitting photometry .",
    "standard iraf tasks ` phot ` and ` allstar ` from the ` daophot ` package were used .",
    "the first test compared the difference between the input and the recovered flux of artificial stars , inserted into different background environments ( using task ` addstar ` ) .",
    "the second test looked at the tightness of the locus of the cluster members on the j - h vs. k-[24 ] diagram .",
    "for the non - excess stars , we assumed that the dispersion is dominated by the measurement errors in the 24 @xmath0 m flux , since reddening is negligible at these wavelengths .",
    "we tried a range of aperture radii starting with the hwhm of the mips beam of 2.3 interpolated pixels ( 1 pixel @xmath17 ) , and a range of sky annuli centered at the first airy ring at 7 pixels .",
    "we finally adopted psf - fitting photometry with a small value for the fitting radius of 3 pixels and a close sky annulus with inner and outer radii of 5 and 10 pixels respectively .",
    "the psf template for all three fields was constructed from 9 stars in the north field , carefully selected to be in the regions clear of nebulosity and to have a representative range of magnitudes . as a check",
    ", another psf was created from 7 clean stars eastward from the cluster center .",
    "magnitudes of the psf stars measured with both psfs agree to within 0.01 mag .    to determine an aperture correction , we compared magnitudes within an aperture radius of 3.5 pixels for the 9 psf stars performed with our adopted _ psf - fitting _ photometry to the _ aperture _ photometry with parameters that would normally be used on a uniform background  aperture radius equal to the fwhm of the beam ( 4.6 pixels ) , sky annulus beyond the first airy ring ( 12 and 18 pixels for the inner and outer radii ) , and aperture correction of 0.68 mag from 4.6 pixels to infinity ( as established by the mips team based on the stinytim simulated psf ) . the resulting aperture correction for our pleiades - customized psf - fitting photometry is 0.89 mag .",
    "finally , to translate fluxes in number counts into 24 @xmath0 m magnitudes , we use a conversion factor of @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 is the data number per pixel , for 1.25 pixels ) .",
    "we took 7.3 jy for the [ 24 ] magnitude zero point .",
    "two cluster members ( hii 1284 and hii 1380 ) , of [ 24]@xmath207@xmath21 ( or @xmath2 10 mjy ) appear on both east and west sub - fields , providing a consistency check of the photometric errors calculated by ` allstar ` .",
    "their magnitudes differ between the two sub - fields by 0.08 and -0.01 mags respectively ( with the larger difference for hii 1284 most certainly due to a faint companion ,  [ binarity ] ) .",
    "we also detect six members in common with @xcite ( hii 173 , hii 174 , hii 250 , hii 314 , hii 514 , hii 2147 ) . the average difference between our mips [ 24 ] magnitudes and stauffer et al.s is -0.02 , rms@xmath220.10 mag .",
    "we have four early - type stars in common with @xcite ( hii 1431 , hii 1823 , hii 1876 , hii 2425 ) ; comparison with updated photometry ( k. y. l. su , private commun . )",
    "indicates 0.07 mag difference between us and the latter work , with rms@xmath220.04 mag .",
    "we conclude that the random error of our 24 @xmath0 m photometry is about 5% for objects brighter than @xmath22 mjy in the clean regions of the sky , which is consistent with the scatter seen in the k-[24 ] color of the non - excess members (  [ excess ] ) .",
    "the systematic error in our data calibration is of similar magnitude ( few percent ) , consistent with comparisons of objects common to other independent studies .",
    "we measured the 24 @xmath0 m fluxes of the pleiades members as follows . using the ` daophot ` task `",
    "find ` and visual inspection , for each mips field we constructed an initial coordinate list for all discernible point - like sources .",
    "task ` phot ` provided initial aperture photometry , which served as input for the psf - fitting photometry with ` allstar ` .",
    "task ` allstar ` was executed with the recentering option turned on .",
    "next , the ` allstar ` coordinates were correlated with the 2mass point - source catalog , with a search radius of 2.5 . using the 2mass designations , we identified pleiades members using an on - line catalog of the highly probable members maintained by j. stauffer .",
    "tables [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] summarize our measurements as well as some catalog properties for these sources . the information on binarity was supplemented with data from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "table [ table2 ] also contains measurements from @xcite for 13 members outside of our field of view .",
    "meaningful psf photometry can not be performed if the sky level is highly variable within the fitting region , or if the object s shape deviates significantly from an airy function with the adopted fwhm .",
    "also compact cirrus falling within the 6 mips beam ( corresponding to 800 @xmath3 at the pleiades distance of 133 pc ) can mimic radiation from an unresolved debris disk . to exclude ambiguity in the photometry",
    ", we examined the image of every detected member .",
    "we designate as problematic objects having either a non - uniform ( filamentary or curved ) background within @xmath2 15 pixels of the target ( 1.5 times the region of sky fitting ) or a bright companion contaminating the target aperture .",
    "for the sources that passed this test , we generated radial profiles and rejected any with fwhm @xmath23 5 pixels ( 6.2 ) .",

    "most of them cluster around the ridge of dense ism cloud in the west part . for a number of them ( highlighted in bold in table [ table1 ] )",
    "the formal procedure of psf - fitting indicates considerable excesses .",
    "whether these excesses are real and due to debris disks or an artifact of cirrus contamination remains to be seen with better resolution .",

    "m excess we use a @xmath24[24 ] color ( where @xmath25 is a 2mass @xmath26 ) .",
    "since there is no nir excess , as expected for stars of age @xmath2100 myr , the @xmath25 band flux represents the photospheric flux .",
    "@xmath25 band is the least affected by reddening of the three 2mass bands . on average ,",
    "the extinction toward the pleiades is small , @xmath27 0.1 mag .",
    "however , it may exceed 1 mag in the south - west , the densest part of the interstellar cloud @xcite , resulting in @xmath28 mag .",
    "considering that this is above the uncertainty of our photometry , red @xmath29 $ ] color due to obscuration may be misinterpreted as a weak 24 @xmath0 m excess .",
    "therefore , we corrected the @xmath30 and @xmath25 magnitudes for extinction .",
    "the extinction values reported in tables [ table1 ] , [ table2 ] are either from the pleiades catalog or have been derived by us for members with known spectral types .",
    "we calculated reddening using @xmath31 and @xmath32 intrinsic colors for dwarfs tabulated in @xcite ( after converting them into the 2mass system following transformations in @xcite ) .",

    "non - detected members within the mips field of view are shown as dots .",
    "one can see that at the age and distance of the pleiades we are 100% complete at detecting photospheres earlier than k3 ( 0.8m@xmath34 ) , and in the absence of interstellar dust ( `` cirrus '' ) could potentially sample photospheres as late as @xmath2m2 ( 0.4m@xmath34 ) .",

    "the @xmath31 axis represents photospheric colors .",
    "the @xmath30 and @xmath25 bands are separated far enough in wavelength space to trace temperature / spectral type and hence luminosity and mass for main sequence stars . the nir colors alone , though less affected by reddening , provide a smaller magnitude range and become non - monotonic at the b - a and k - m transitions .",

    "two more , hii 1200 ( outside of our field of view ) and hii 514 , may possess weaker excesses according to the photometry of @xcite . despite the difference in the integration times ( 400 s per source in @xcite and 80 s in our survey ) , both studies observe a similar scatter in the @xmath29 $ ] color for the solar - type `` non - excess '' stars ",
    "0.04 - 0.05 mag from the average 0 value .",
    "this makes it difficult to prove excesses in these two stars beyond the 3@xmath39 level ; only hii 514 would pass the 0.15 mag threshold adopted in this work .",

    "could excess emission arise from a nearby object confused with a pleiades member ?",
    "the average offset between mips and 2mass positions for members from table [ table2 ] is 0.8 . except for hii 514 and hii 1095 , which are the faintest excess candidates , the 24 @xmath0 m positions fall within a r@xmath220.5 circle around the 0.8 systematic offset on the @xmath40 vs. @xmath41 plane , together with the majority of the non - excess members .",
    "furthermore , they have flux densities above 2 mjy , and the previous studies have shown that the probability of a spurious excess due to chance alignment with a background giant star or galaxy at this flux level is small ",
    "@xmath120.1% per source @xcite . due to the proximity of the pleiades to the ecliptic",
    "however , there is concern about asteroid contamination .",
    "we examined images of the detected pleiades members for the presence of nearby companions without a 2mass counterpart  signaling a medium - speed asteroid leaving a chain of images as it moves between successive scans .",
    "also , when the object fell in the overlapping region between two fields , we could identify contamination by fast moving asteroids by comparing two images obtained a few days to a half year apart .",
    "a close companion to hii 320 from table [ table1 ] is one such example of likely asteroid contamination , but none are among the 14 excess candidates .",
    "the strongest excess among point - like sources belongs to hii 2181 ( 28 tau , pleione ) .",
    "the third strongest excess is for hii 1432 ( 25 tau , @xmath42 tau , alcyone ) , the optically brightest member ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "both stars belong to the be , or classical , type of emission - line b - a stars .",
    "two other emission stars , hii 468 ( 17 tau , electra ) and hii 980 ( 23 tau , merope ) , may also possess excesses of @xmath20.5 mag , but unfortunately bright nebulosities surrounding these stars make our measurements uncertain ( placing them in table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "all four are post - ms stars , which is indicated by their giant or sub - giant luminosity classes , and fast rotators ( @xmath43200 km / s ) .",
    "the excess emission is probably free - free emission from gaseous keplerian disks produced by radiation - driven mass loss and fast rotation @xcite .",
    "the emission stage is episodic  once in about @xmath210 years for reasons still debated these stars eject a shell that settles into a temporal disk in the equatorial plane . in some cases",
    "shell episodes coincide with the periastron passage of a companion @xcite .",
    "mass transfer in a binary system could also account for the spin up of the primary @xcite .",
    "pleione is a good example ",
    "fastest rotator , with biggest ir excess and a companion resolved with speckle interferometry @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "any companion to merope has escaped detection so far @xcite ; the only indirect evidence for one is the prominent x - ray emission @xcite .    in the absence of spectroscopic information for",
    "the photometrically selected members in clusters other than the pleiades , debris disk stars can be distinguished from emission - line stars by the absence of excess nir emission in the former , since even the hottest candidate debris disks have t@xmath44 k @xcite .",
    "indeed , none of the rest of the 12 excess members possesses an excess in the 2mass colors , nor is mentioned as an emission - line star .",
    "we therefore regard these stars as debris disk candidates .    the 24 @xmath0 m images of the 9 debris disk candidates discovered in this work are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ; the remaining 3 are from @xcite . the central contour is drawn at 1/2 of the intensity of the brightest pixel on the source , as a measure of the fwhm . as can be seen from these images",
    ", the excess emission appears symmetrical and unresolved within the mips beam of 6 , meaning that it is confined to @xmath4800 @xmath3 from the parent stars , consistent with the sizes of the nearby debris disks resolved in the mid - ir @xcite .",
    "the remaining contours are drawn at the level of the median sky intensity , representing the quality of the background . in all cases",
    "the background is flat or only tilted ( hii 489 and hii 1284 ) , but uniform within at least the first airy ring where we measure the sky level , lending confidence to the reality of the detected excesses ( compare with the uncertain excess candidates hii 1234 and hii 1061 from table [ table1 ] shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "we now discuss individual debris disk candidates in more detail .",
    "we arrive at a similar conclusion as @xcite : except for the 24 @xmath0 m excess , the host stars for debris disks do not stand out as a group in any other properties .",
    "we find however that excesses are more frequent among early - type stars , and that the solar - type candidates are predominantly single stars .",
    "all disk candidates , except for hii 1095 , hii 2425 and pels 58 , have been also imaged with irac .",
    "none was found to show excess at wavelengths @xmath45 m , similar to cirrus - free non - excess members ( * ? ? ? * in preparation ) .",
    "this property provides yet another defense against false excesses from heated interstellar material , since in such cases we would expect to detect aromatic emission in the 6 to 8@xmath0 m range .",
    "@xcite have modeled the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) from 0.3 to 30 @xmath0 m in hii 1101 .",
    "they found that the 24 @xmath0 m emission arises from a 84 k disk with a central hole 13 @xmath3 in radius . considering that @xmath31 , irac and mips fluxes of our strongest solar - type disk candidate hii 1797 are very similar to hii 1101",
    ", it could be that a similar cold disk is observed in hii 1797 as well , and probably much different from the ones around the f9 dwarf in m 47 and m dwarf in ngc 2547 that have much stronger 24 @xmath0 m excesses @xcite . given the relatively few constraints , a variety of alternative disk models are also likely to be compatible with the seds of these stars .",
    "one can expect two opposite effects of binarity on debris disks .",
    "the circumstellar disks in binaries may be more truncated and the inner part of the circumbinary disk better cleared compared to the single stars , in which case one expects an anticorreletion between excess and binarity .",
    "on the other hand , a companion can stir up the debris disk prompting more collisions and greater dust production .",

    "it is seen at the same location on the east and west sub - fields obtained few days apart .",
    "the absence of a 2mass counterpart , meaning @xmath52 , and the small reddening of hii 1284 , indicate that , if a pleiades member , this object would have to be of very low luminosity ( m6 or later ) with a huge excess .",
    "the observed colors are too red for an optically thin debris disk , comparable only to excesses from primordial disks in much younger objects ( * ? ? ?",

    "we conclude that the debris disk candidates in the pleiades are predominantly single stars .",
    "a few cases  hii 1284 , hii 2195 and hii 1101 are possible , but unconfirmed , spectroscopic binaries . thus our debris disk stars should be directly comparable with the field - star studies of @xcite and @xcite that apply to predominantly single - star samples .",

    "the sizes of the circles represent the magnitude of the 24 @xmath0 m excesses .",
    "as one can see , the disk candidates are not distinguishable from the diskless ones in this diagram ( in agreement with @xcite ) .",
    "although we do not confirm the @xcite finding , a larger sample is needed for a better test .",
    "in addition , the pleiades stars are significantly older than the members of the sco - cen association studied by chen et al . , and the wind drag must be less effective because the stellar wind is weaker .",
    "we will now compare the excess rate for the pleiades stars with results from other studies .",
    "various authors use slightly different criteria to define a significant excess , dictated mainly by the precision of their ir measurements , and split their samples into slightly different spectral type / color bins , which are usually limited by the volume and detection limits of a given survey .",
    "spectral type and binarity information are not available for the majority of cluster stars either . for a preliminary comparison with other studies",
    "we define those pleiades members to have excesses that deviate by more than 0.15 mag ( @xmath23@xmath39 ) from the @xmath29 $ ] locus of non - excess members as derived in  [ excess ] .",

    "note that a 0.06 mag difference in [ 24 ] between us and @xcite puts hii 514 just below the boundary between excess and non - excess objects .",
    "our 0.15 mag excess threshold also eliminates hii 1200 as an excess candidate , so we add only hii 1101 from @xcite as having a confirmed excess .    in table",
    "[ table3 ] we compile _ spitzer _",
    "results on the 24 @xmath0 m excess fractions in several young clusters and associations and in the field , separately for early - type and solar - type stars .",
    "they are binned into several age categories that roughly correspond to the main episodes of dust production in the solar system  clearing of the primordial disk and vigorous collisions between growing planetesimals within the first 10 myr ; rare collisions between terrestrial planet embryos ( e.g. , the earth - moon creation at 30 myr ) ; possible migration of giant planets that stir smaller bodies and initiate collisional cascades ( late heavy bombardment at 700 myr ) ; and finally a constant process of dust production from colliding asteroids and evaporation of comets .",
    "we derive another limit on debris disk excesses using g giants .",
    "g giants are tracers of the post - main - sequence evolution of a stars , unlike cooler k - m giants which are a mixture of stars with a wide range of masses and at various late evolutionary stages .",
    "@xcite searched the _ iras _ point source catalog for 60 @xmath0 m excess emission in g giants .",
    "he found no confident excess among 36 giants .",
    "this allows estimation of an upper limit @xmath58 on the true excess fraction , using the binomial distribution as appropriate for the small number statistics here . at a confidence level of 0.954 ( that corresponds to @xmath59 in the gaussian approximation )",
    "@xmath58 is calculated from @xmath60 , resulting in @xmath61 .",
    "based on a larger sample ( that includes fainter stars ) @xcite found the 60 @xmath0 m excess fraction to be 0 - 3% for g giants , and even less at 25",
    "@xmath0 m .",
    "@xcite reexamined a dozen @xmath62 excesses around g - k giants with @xmath63 and found dust to extend at least a few thousand @xmath3 ( with t @xmath4 100 k ) , which excludes a debris disk interpretation .",
    "we therefore adopt 8% as a conservative limit on the 25 @xmath0 m excess fraction from debris disks around evolved stars of a few solar masses .",
    "data from table [ table3 ] are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] .",
    "an important new result is the high level of excesses at 24 @xmath0 m for the roughly solar mass stars in the pleiades compared to older field dwarfs . for the field dwarf sample",
    ", we have combined the work of @xcite , @xcite , and beichman et al .",
    "( 2006 , in preparation ) into a total sample of 167 stars of solar mass and typical age @xmath461 gyr . of these stars ,",
    "two have excesses at 24 @xmath0 m , compared with five of 53 solar mass stars in the pleiades .",
    "we have used the binomial theorem to test the significance of this difference and find a probability of less than 0.3% that the two samples are drawn from the same distribution .",
    "that is , 24 @xmath0 m excesses are more common at 100 myr than at @xmath461 gyr at a statistically significant level .",
    "the incidence of pleiades 24 @xmath0 m excesses appears to be higher still in stars of @xmath2 2.5 m@xmath64 ( a - stars ) ",
    "25% vs. 9% in solar mass stars ( with a 96% confidence ) .",
    "does this mean that debris disk masses are systematically greater in high - mass stars ?",
    "for example , a broad range of masses was found for primordial disks around low - mass stars in @xcite , which may translate into varying planetesimal masses and give rise to a great variation in debris dust production .",
    "however , in the absence of photometry at longer wavelengths , one can not rule out that the observed difference in excesses is due to the difference in the stellar luminosity or in the spectral energy distribution .",
    "more luminous a stars are capable of heating up material to larger distances , resulting in a geometrically larger area that emits at 24 @xmath0 m . on the other hand ,",
    "radiation pressure which is the dominant dust removal mechanism around luminous stars , is also a function of wavelength .",
    "stellar mass and wind are additional factors that enter the expressions for the forces acting on the dust particle ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "at this time it is not clear which of the these effects is the most important cause of the difference .",
    "while this observation awaits confirmation from other clusters , the decline in disk fraction with time for both a- and solar - type stars is similar .",
    "we thus qualitatively conclude that the disk evolution is similar over the 0.8 to 2.5 m@xmath34 stellar mass range , and that a significant number of stars within this range are still producing debris at high levels in their planetary zones ( @xmath21  20 @xmath3 ) at 100 myr of age .",
    "the apparent difference between field a - stars and field solar - type stars arises to first order simply because the a - stars are systematically younger .",
    "we can therefore use the solar - mass stars as an indication of the evolution of debris disks past the main sequence lifetime of a stars .",
    "twenty two of the sample of 167 solar - mass stars discussed above are detected at 70 @xmath0 m ( in general , the observations are deep enough to detect the stellar photospheres , although often at only low signal to noise ) .",
    "the rate of detection at this wavelength is 13@xmath653% , compared with a rate of @xmath21% at 24 @xmath0 m .",
    "2006 , to be submitted to apj , demonstrates for the field a stars of various ages and @xcite for nearby b - k young stars , that the 70 @xmath0 m excess fraction decays slower than the 24 @xmath0 m one .",
    "we conclude that the decline of the 24 @xmath0 m emission with age corresponds to the decline of the frequency of collisions or disruptive events within the inner parts of the planetary systems , corresponding to the asteroidal zone of the solar system .",
    "the outer parts detected at 70 @xmath0 m , corresponding to the kuiper belt zone , evolve more slowly .",
    "terrestrial planets had formed in the solar system at @xmath230 myr @xcite and presumably largely cleared material in the inner few @xmath3 region that we are probing at 24 @xmath0 m .",
    "however , in different planetary system architectures , moon - sized bodies within 1 @xmath3 may still survive by the pleiades age of @xmath2115 myr @xcite .",
    "occasional collisions could give rise to intermittent excesses at 24 @xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "another source of warm dust at this age could be occasional disturbances of the asteroid or cometary belts by migrating giant planets .",
    "dynamical simulations show that giant planets can experience strong interactions near the mean motion resonances , resulting in dramatic episodes of scattering and producing a collisional cascade of the smaller bodies , perhaps explaining the late heavy bombardment at 700 myr in the inner solar system @xcite .",
    "@xcite have quantified this picture in a series of simulations for a solar - type and an a - type star .",
    "the predicted evolution of the 24 @xmath0 m excess can be directly compared to observations from our figs [ fig4 ] and [ fig7 ] .",
    "after 10 myr an overall decline in 24 @xmath0 m excess is predicted , but with levels that are always bigger for the more luminous a stars .",
    "indeed , the _ average _ excess is observed to decline with age for both early and late - type stars , and the fraction of detected excesses appears smaller in the solar - type stars compared to the early - type ones ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) . but",
    "how can we explain the observed _ range _ of excesses between stars of similar age and mass ? for solar - type stars , the simulations show it can be explained by collisions within a few @xmath3 that produce short - lived excesses in amounts much bigger than the weak preexisting level . for a stars , however , the simulations behave differently : the 24 @xmath0 m emission comes from distances up to 100 @xmath3 , and the excess from a single collision never competes with the excess from the bulk of the disk ( compare figs . 4 and 8 in @xcite ) .",
    "this result also appears to contradict the observed extent of the vega system @xcite .",
    "therefore , explaining disk behavior as a function of stellar mass is an area requiring further investigation .",
    "we have conducted a photometric survey for warm dusty disks in the pleiades , the nearest medium - age ( @xmath2100 myr ) open cluster . at this age",
    ", terrestrial planet formation should be complete , and the inner few @xmath3 region is expected to be largely cleared of dust .",
    "the dust however can be temporarily replenished , either from occasional asteroid collisions or from the outer regions where giant planet migration may still be occurring .",
    "indeed , we find 24 @xmath0 m excess emission around nine b9-k0 non - emission stars .",
    "the fraction of b - a stars with excesses is 25% , comparing well to a similar age cluster m 47 @xcite .    because of the proximity of the pleiades , for the first time we can explore excesses in solar - mass stars down to the photospheric limit .",
    "combined with the @xcite sample , we find that the incidence of 24 @xmath0 m excesses for these stars , at 10% , is significantly higher than that for old field solar - mass stars , 1% .",
    "thus , the clearing of debris in the planetary zone ( @xmath21  20 @xmath3 ) for these stars takes a similar time as the similar process in a - stars , of order 100 million years . comparing with the incidence of 70 @xmath0 m excess in @xmath461 gyr old solar mass stars , 13@xmath653%",
    ", it appears that the outer , kuiper belt - like zones of planetary debris clear much more slowly that the planetary zones seen at 24 @xmath0 m .",
