    "in the last two decades , considerable progress has been made in loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) , which is a background independent approach to quantum gravity @xcite .",

    "the quantum kinematical framework of lqg has been rigorously constructed , and the hamiltonian constraint operator can also be well defined to represent quantum dynamics . moreover , a few physically significant results have been obtained in the minisuperspace models of loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) @xcite . the most interesting one is the _ resolution of big bang singularity _ in lqc @xcite . besides the canonical formalism , the so - called spin foam models were proposed as the path integral formalism of lqg @xcite . however , whether the two approaches are equivalent to each other is a longstanding open question . thanks to the development of lqc , we have a much simpler theory to address this question . as symmetry - reduced models",
    ", there are only finite number of degrees of freedom in lqc . following the conventional method in quantum mechanics",
    ", one can find the path integral formalism of lqc starting with the canonical formalism .",
    "this approach has been implemented by a series of works @xcite with the scheme of simplified lqc @xcite . here",
    "one employed the complete basis of eigen - states of the volume operator to formulate a path integral with somehow _ descrete - steps _ , which inherited certain properties of spin foams @xcite .",
    "moreover , the first - order effective action for the path integral was derived by this approach @xcite , which implied the origin of singularity resolution of lqc in the path integral representation . in canonical lqc , the effective hamiltonian constraint with higher - order quantum corrections could even be obtained by the semiclassical analysis using coherent states , which implied a possible effect of quantum gravity on large scale cosmology @xcite .",
    "it is thus interesting to see whether the effective hamiltonian can be confirmed by some path integral representation .",
    "since the higher - order corrections of the hamiltonian come from the quantum fluctuations , a natural attempt to achieve them is to employ coherent state path integral @xcite .    in lqc",

    "we can also take another practical way to symmetrize @xmath82 at the beginning .",
    "for example , one can define a symmetric version of @xmath78 by ^:=(+^ ) , and then carry out the same procedure of above coherent state functional integral . in the calculation of matrix element @xmath83 , we could think that the operators @xmath75 and @xmath84 in @xmath78 act on _ bra _ @xmath85 and _ ket _ @xmath86 respectively , while @xmath84 and @xmath75 in @xmath87 act on _ bra _ @xmath85 and _ ket _ @xmath86 respectively .",

    "the irrelevant correction terms proportional to @xmath101 could be neglected , while the relevant terms proportional to @xmath102 would be kept , since @xmath103 was understood as the fluctuation of @xmath89 which does not depend on the fiducial cell .",

    "it should be noted that the effective equation and hence the inferred effect of re - collapse are only valid with the coherent states of gaussian type . whether there is a similar result for other semiclassical states is still an interesting open issue .",

    "<S> it turns out that for a non - symmetric hamiltonian constraint operator , the _ moyal ( star)-product _ emerges naturally in the effective hamiltonian . for the corresponding symmetric hamiltonian operator , </S>",
    "<S> the resulted effective theory implies a possible quantum cosmological effect in large scale limit in the alternative dynamical scenario , which coincides with the result in canonical approach . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the first - order modified friedmann equation still contains the particular information of alternative dynamics and hence admits the possible phenomenological distinction between the different proposals of quantum dynamics . </S>",
