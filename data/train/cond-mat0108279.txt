    "the density response of doped mott - hubbard insulators like the high - t@xmath5 superconductors is expected to differ strongly from that of weakly correlated metals . due to the mott - hubbard gap",
    "the low - energy density response in the doped systems is proportional to the number of holes and not proportional to the electron concentration .",
    "experimentally the peculiarities of the density response in high - temperature superconductors show up ( i ) in the anomalous mid - infrared absorption in the frequency dependent conductivity , ( ii ) in the renormalization and strong increase of linewidth of certain phonon modes upon doping , and ( iii ) the charge instability leading to the stripe phase .",
    "while static stripes in cuprates are found only in the ltt - phase it is expected that dynamic stripe like correlations exist also in the other cuprate materials .",
    "exact diagonalization studies@xcite of the dynamical density response @xmath0 at large momentum transfer have revealed several features unexpected from the point of view of weakly correlated fermion systems : ( a ) the very different form of @xmath0 compared to the spin response function @xmath6 , which share common features in usual fermionic systems ; ( b ) a strong suppression of low energy @xmath7 scattering in the density response , ( c ) a broad incoherent peak in the higher energy range @xmath8 with large dispersion , whose shape is rather insensitive to hole concentration ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) and exchange interaction @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , exact diagonalization studies show ( d ) a low - energy structure on scale @xmath2 for certain momenta which grows in intensity with @xmath2 .    while considerable analytical work has been done to explain the spin response of the @xmath1-@xmath2 model@xcite , only few authors analyzed @xmath0 .",
    "et al._@xcite studied collective excitations in the density channel and found sharp peaks at large momenta corresponding to free bosons .",
    "similar results were obtained by gehlhoff and zeyher@xcite using the @xmath11-operator formalism . in these calculations fluctuations",
    "were treated in the leading order of a @xmath12-expansion which is however not sufficient to explain the incoherent character of @xmath0 .",
    "it was shown subsequently by khaliullin and horsch  @xcite , who used a slave - boson approach , that the next order in @xmath12-expansion is crucial to obtain renormalized polaron - like boson - propagators for the holes , which explained both the incoherent structure at high energy and the appearance of a low energy peak associated with the coherent polaron motion .",
    "the characteristic energy scale of the low - energy polaron peak is @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the uniform rvb - order parameter relevant for the overdoped regime studied in that work .",
    "in addition on the same energy scale @xmath15 there is a smooth fermi - liquid like particle - hole continuum , which reflects the fermi surface , with total weight @xmath16 .",
    "further studies @xcite analysed the incoherent part of @xmath0 yet did not obtain the low - energy structure .",
    "the aim of the present work is to investigate @xmath17 in the low - doping regime .",
    "we confine our study to the af long - range ordered phase which implies a different fermi surface and collective spin wave excitations .",
    "there are two key questions : ( i ) what theory is needed to produce spectra at high energy similar to the large doping regime as required by diagonalization studies and ( ii ) what are the implications of the long - range magnetic order and the small hole - pocket fermi surface for the low energy charge response ?",
    "we consider here the @xmath18 @xmath19 model as the generic model for the description of strongly correlated electrons in cuprates : @xmath20 where the operator @xmath21 describes the annihilation of an electron with spin @xmath22 at site @xmath23 with the constraint of no double occupancy , @xmath24 is the spin operator , and the summation @xmath25 runs over nearest - neighbor bonds on the square lattice .",
    "we rewrite the constrained electron operators in terms of spinless fermions @xmath26 which denote the holes and use holstein - primakoff bosons @xmath27 to describe the spin degrees of freedom .",

    "this problem can be resolved by rewriting @xmath41 in terms of the static susceptibility @xmath43 and a selfenergy @xmath44@xcite : @xmath45 the evaluation of the memory function @xmath44 by expanding in a small parameter ( here the coupling constant @xmath1 ) gives correct results for @xmath41 valid for all frequencies . from this expression",
    "it is obvious that an evaluation of @xmath46 to low order in the coupling constant @xmath1 implies for the charge susceptibility @xmath14 a partial resummation up to infinite order .",

    "the fermion propagators are evaluated within selfconsistent born approximation at finite doping concentration ; more details will be given elsewhere .",
    "the still unknown @xmath43 is determined from the integral relation @xmath52 and the fact that the static charge structure factor @xmath53 is well approximated in the strong correlation regime by the @xmath53 for spinless fermions@xcite .",

    "@xmath0 is characterized by a broad continuum which moves to higher energy as @xmath54 increases . at @xmath32 the spectrum peaks at @xmath55 , i.e. , the variation of @xmath0 with @xmath54 and the energy scale are fully consistent with the diagonalization results for small systems@xcite .",
    "low energy structures on scale @xmath2 , due to quasiparticle scattering between hole pockets , appear at small and intermediate momentum transfers and vanish at the zone boundary . the pronounced low - energy structure at large momentum transfer in @xmath33 direction found in the spin liquid regime @xcite is absent .",
    "the high energy planar breathing and bond - stretching oxygen modes in @xmath32 and @xmath33 direction , respectively , show the strongest doping dependence from all phonon modes  @xcite which appears to be a generic feature of cuprates .",
    "inelastic neutron scattering studies of the lo mode in @xmath33 direction in la@xmath56sr@xmath57cuo@xmath58 ( @xmath59)@xcite reveal a @xmath60 renormalization near @xmath33 as compared to the undoped system , while there is no significant renormalization at the @xmath61-point .",
    "surprisingly the linewidth assumes a maximum at intermediate @xmath62@xcite .",
    "the coupling of these phonon modes to density fluctuations is described by @xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 are the displacements of the four oxygen neighbors of the hole , @xmath65 is the electron - phonon coupling constant .",

    "the damping appears to be largest not at the zone - boundary but at intermediate @xmath54 .",
    "we note that earlier calculations for larger doping , @xmath80 , show a significantly larger energy change at @xmath33 than at @xmath32 , which was due to the pronounced low energy polaron related structure in @xmath0 near @xmath33 in the spin disordered state@xcite .",
    "the low - energy structure of @xmath0 in the af ordered system considered here is markedly different , and suggests nontrivial changes for the phonon renormalization as function of doping .",
    "hence we conclude by stressing that phonon modes , and in particular those discussed here , provide a sensitive probe for the anomalous low - energy charge response of doped mott insulators .",
    "furthermore it is expected that measurements at different doping concentrations will reveal significant changes of phonon energies and damping due to the changes in the spin response and in the topology of the fermi surface , which in turn strongly affect the charge response at low energy ."
