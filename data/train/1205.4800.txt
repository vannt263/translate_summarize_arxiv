    "though it is almost a century since the inception of quantum mechanics ( qm ) , its foundations and origin remain quite puzzling and continue to inspire intense inquiry . in this letter",
    ", we attempt to illuminate the connection between the mathematical structure of qm and its physical characteristics by constructing a ` mutant ' quantum mechanical model which shares many , but not all of the mathematical features of canonical qm . by",
    "investigating which characteristics of canonical qm survive the ` mutation ' and which ones do not , we hope to clarify the relation between the mathematical genotype and the physical phenotype .    in canonical qm ,",
    "the states of an @xmath1-level quantum system are described by vectors in the hilbert space @xmath2 . in the following ,",
    "we introduce a ` mutation ' by replacing @xmath3 with @xmath4 @xcite , where @xmath5 is shorthand for the finite galois field @xmath0 , @xmath6 for some prime @xmath7 , and @xmath8 . for the case @xmath9",
    ", we have @xmath10 . such replacements of the vector space have been considered previously , _",
    "e.g. _ real qm in which @xmath3 is replaced by @xmath11 @xcite , and quaternionic qm in which it is replaced by @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "however , the vector space @xmath13 , in contradistinction to @xmath14 , @xmath3 , or @xmath15 , lacks an inner product , normalizable states , and symmetric / hermitian operators .",
    "nevertheless , we find that we can construct a perfectly ` quantum ' model on it , which predicts probabilities of physical measurements that can not be reproduced in any hidden variable theory .",
    "what will not survive this ` mutation , ' however , are the super - classical correlations of canonical qm . in particular , we show that in our discrete qm , the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) @xcite version of bell s inequality @xcite is not violated .",
    "before we proceed , we emphasize that our model is distinct from ` galois quantum systems ' discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "there , it is the phase space which is assumed to be @xmath16 , that is , the position and momentum of a particle take on values in @xmath5 . in our approach ,",
    "it is the wave - functions that take on values in @xmath17 , while the outcomes of measurements take on values in @xmath18 .",
    "our starting point is the following canonical expression for the probability of obtaining the outcome represented by the dual - vector @xmath19 when a measurement is performed on the state represented by the vector @xmath20 : @xmath21 here , @xmath22 is not normalized and the sum in the denominator runs over the duals of all the eigenstates of a hermitian operator which represents the observable in question .",
    "however , for this expression to be interpretable as a probability , the necessary condition is that the dual - vectors in the sum span the entire dual vector space @xmath23 , and any reference to operators acting on @xmath3 is inessential .",
    "the interpretation that the bracket @xmath24 is an inner product between two vectors also need not be imposed .",
    "the probability depends only on the absolute values of the brackets @xmath25 . since we can multiply @xmath22 with any non - zero complex number without changing the probabilities defined via eq .",
    "( [ pdef ] ) , we are compelled to identify vectors which differ by a non - zero multiplicative constant as representing the same physical state , endowing the state space with the complex projective geometry @xmath26 where each line going through the origin of @xmath27 is identified as a ` point . '    thus , to construct a ` mutant ' qm on @xmath13 , we represent states with vectors @xmath28 , and outcomes of measurements with dual - vectors @xmath29 .",
    "observables are associated with a choice of basis of @xmath30 , each dual - vector in it representing a different outcome .",
    "the bracket @xmath31 is converted into a non - negative real number @xmath25 via the absolute value function : @xmath32 here , underlined numbers and symbols represent elements of @xmath5 , to distinguish them from elements of @xmath18 or @xmath33 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ abs ] ) is not to be interpreted as a condition imposed on @xmath31 ; all non - zero values of @xmath5 are mapped to one .",
    "since @xmath34 is a cyclic multiplicative group , this assignment of ` absolute values ' is the only one consistent with the requirement that the map from @xmath5 to non - negative @xmath18 be product preserving , that is : @xmath35 . with these assignments , eq .",
    "( [ pdef ] ) can be applied as it stands to calculate probabilities .",
    "since the same absolute value is assigned to all non - zero brackets , all outcomes @xmath36 for which the bracket with the state @xmath22 is non - zero are given equal probabilistic weight .",
    "the product preserving nature of the absolute value function guarantees that the probabilities of product observables on product states factorize in multi - particle systems : @xmath37 this property is crucial if we want to have isolated particle states , and is of course shared by canonical qm defined on @xmath38 .",
    "note also that the multiplication of @xmath22 with a non - zero element of @xmath5 will not affect the probability .",
    "thus , vectors that differ by non - zero multiplicative constants are identified as representing the same physical state , and the state space is endowed with the finite projective geometry @xcite @xmath39 where each ` line ' going through the origin of @xmath17 is identified as a ` point , ' in close analogy to the complex projective geometry of canonical qm .",
    "to give a concrete example of our proposal , let us construct a 2-level system , analogous to spin , for which @xmath40 , and the state space is @xmath41 .",
    "this geometry consists of @xmath42 ` points , ' which can be represented by the vectors @xmath43,\\quad { | \\,1\\ , \\rangle } = \\left[\\begin{array}{c } { \\underline{0}}\\\\ { \\underline{1}}\\end{array}\\right],\\quad { | \\,r\\ , \\rangle } = \\left[\\begin{array}{l } \\underline{a}^{r-1 } \\\\ { \\underline{1}}\\end{array}\\right],\\ ] ] @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the generator of the multiplicative group @xmath34 with @xmath46 .",
    "the number @xmath42 results from the fact that of the @xmath47 non - zero vectors , every @xmath48 are equivalent , thus the number of inequivalent vectors are @xmath49 .",
    "similarly , the @xmath42 inequivalent dual - vectors can be represented as : @xmath50\\;,\\cr { \\langle \\,\\overline{1}\\ , | } & = & \\bigl[\\,{\\underline{1}}\\;\\;\\phantom{-}{\\underline{0}}\\,\\bigr]\\;,\\cr { \\langle \\,\\overline{r}\\ , | } & = & \\bigl[\\,{\\underline{1}}\\;-\\!\\underline{a}^{r-1}\\,\\bigr]\\;,\\qquad r=2,3,\\cdots , q\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the minus signs are dropped when the characteristic of @xmath5 is two . from these definitions , we find : @xmath51 and @xmath52 observables are associated with a choice of basis of @xmath30 : @xmath53 we assign the outcome @xmath54 to the first dual - vector of the pair , and the outcome @xmath55 to the second to make these observables spin - like .",
    "this assignment implies @xmath56 .",
    "the indices @xmath57 can be considered as indicating the direction of the ` spin , ' and the interchange of the indices as indicating a reversal of this direction .    applying eq .",
    "( [ pdef ] ) to this system , it is straightforward to show that @xmath58 and thus , @xmath59 so for each ` spin , ' there exist two ` eigenstates , ' one for @xmath54 ( ` spin ' up ) and another for @xmath55 ( ` spin ' down ) . for",
    "all other states the two outcomes @xmath60 are equally probable .    the states and observables `",
    "rotate ' into each other under changes of bases . for the projective geometry @xmath41 ,",
    "the group of all possible basis transformations constitute the projective group @xmath61 of order @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath61 is formally a subgroup of @xmath63 , the group of all possible permutations of the @xmath42 states .",
    "to show that our system is truly quantum , we use an argument analogous to those of greenberger , horne , shimony , and zeilinger @xcite , and of hardy @xcite for canonical qm .",
    "let us construct a two ` spin ' system on the tensor product space @xmath64 .",
    "the number of non - zero vectors in this space is @xmath65 , of which every @xmath48 are equivalent , so the number of inequivalent states is @xmath66 . of these , @xmath67 are product states , leaving @xmath68 that are entangled . as noted previously , eq .",
    "( [ pdef ] ) applied to tensored spaces with the product preserving absolute value function eq .",
    "( [ abs ] ) ensures that the expectation values of product observables factorize for product states , thereby rendering the distinction between product and entangled states meaningful .",
    "the number of entangled states matches the order of the group @xmath61 , since arranging the 4 elements of an entangled state into a @xmath69 array gives rise to a non - singular matrix .",
    "the entangled states fall into ` conjugacy ' classes , matching those of @xmath61 , that transform among themselves under @xmath61 ` rotations . '",
    "the singlet state , corresponding to the conjugacy class of the unit element , can be expressed as @xmath70 for any two states @xmath71 and @xmath72 up to a multiplicative constant .",
    "if the characteristic of @xmath5 is two , the minus sign is replaced by a plus sign .",
    "products of the ` spin ' observables are defined as @xmath73 the four tensor products representing the outcomes @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 , and the expectation value giving the correlation between the two ` spins . '",
    "the probabilities of the four outcomes are particularly easy to calculate for the singlet state @xmath78 since @xcite @xmath79 thus @xmath80 and we obtain the probabilities and correlations listed in table .",
    "[ probs ] .",
    ".probabilities and expectation values of product observables in the singlet state @xmath78 .",
    "the indices @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 are distinct .",
    "cases that can be obtained by flipping signs using @xmath85 are not shown . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to demonstrate that these correlations can not be reproduced in any hidden variable theory , it suffices to look at the correlations between two observables that share an index .",
    "for instance , consider the following two : @xmath86 first , from the first row of table  [ probs ] we can discern that @xmath87 where we have added subscripts to distinguish between the two ` spins . '",
    "this tells us that the pairs @xmath88 and @xmath89 are completely anti - correlated .",
    "next , from the second row of table  [ probs ] , we conclude : @xmath90 which means that if either one of the pairs @xmath91 and @xmath92 is @xmath54 , then its partner must be @xmath55 .",
    "thus , the implications of either @xmath93 or @xmath94 would be : @xmath95 in either case , we can not classically have @xmath96 or @xmath97 , even though both configurations have quantum mechanical probabilities of @xmath98 .",
    "thus , our ` mutant ' qm is truly ` quantum ' and its predictions do not allow any hidden variable mimic .",
    "let us now look at what the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) bound @xcite would be in our ` mutant ' qm .",
    "the chsh bound is the upper bound of the absolute value of the following combination of correlators : @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are two observables of particle 1 , and @xmath102 and @xmath103 are two observables of particle 2 .",
    "all four observables are assumed to take on only the values @xmath60 upon measurement . for classical hidden variable theory ,",
    "the bound on @xmath104 is 2 , while for canonical qm it is @xmath105 @xcite .    to calculate this bound for our model",
    ", it suffices to examine all possible correlators for the singlet state @xmath78 only .",
    "this is because all @xmath62 entangled states can be transformed into @xmath78 via local @xmath61 rotations , that is , @xmath61 transformations on only one of the entangled particles .",
    "we can also restrict the observables entering the correlator to those in which the indices are in increasing order , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath106 with @xmath107 , since @xmath108 these considerations simplify our task considerably , and we find that the absolute value of the chsh correlator is maximized for the cases @xmath109 thus , the chsh bound for our ` mutant ' qm is 2 .",
    "in conclusion , we have constructed a ` mutant ' qm based on a linear vector space over the galois field @xmath110 .",
    "we find that though it is fully ` quantum ' in the sense that no hidden variable theory can reproduce its predictions , the chsh bound of its correlations nevertheless has the ` classical ' value of 2 .",
    "thus , our model provides an existence proof that ` quantum'-ness does not necessarily require the violation of the chsh bound .",
    "the state space of our ` mutant ' qm is the finite projective space @xmath111 , in close analogy to the @xmath112 of canonical qm .",
    "we recall that this complex projective space can be understood as the coset @xmath113 this structure incorporates unitary evolution described by the @xmath114 factor , thereby preserving the normalization of state vectors , with generic berry phases described by the @xmath115 factor , which characterize possible degenerate states , and the quantum mechanical @xmath116 phases @xcite .",
    "the corresponding coset structure of @xmath111 is : @xmath117 where , @xmath118 is the general linear group on @xmath13 , @xmath119 its center consisting of @xmath120 unit matrices multiplied by a ` phase ' in @xmath34 , and @xmath121 is the affine linear group which keeps the direction of a vector in @xmath13 invariant .",
    "the projective linear group we encountered earlier is itself the coset group @xmath122 thus , our discrete qm possesses analogs of the geometric structure of canonical qm , with @xmath118 generating evolution over finite time steps , and @xmath121 characterizing possible degeneracies in dynamical systems .",
    "the extent that elements of this affine group and the center @xmath119 determines any super - selection sectors has yet to be explored @xcite .",
    "the @xmath123 case of our model , constructed on @xmath124 , would be particularly simple .",
    "it could , perhaps , be the simplest quantum theory imaginable and provide a setting to explore the most basic questions concerning the foundations of qm , as well as a platform to develop ideas relevant to quantum information and quantum computing @xcite .",
    "a question we addressed in a previous publication @xcite was whether a super - quantum theory whose chsh bound exceeds the cirelson value of @xmath105 of canonical qm exists @xcite .",
    "such super - quantum models are expected to go ` beyond ' canonical qm in one way or another .",
    "the model discussed in this paper was discovered in the process of looking for such a model , though , of course , its correlations are sub - quantum instead .",
    "an interesting question to ask is whether a ` super ' version of our discrete model can be constructed in which the chsh bound exceeds 2 .",
    "we conjectured in ref .   that a super - quantum theory may exist in the @xmath125 limit of canonical qm .",
    "recalling that @xmath126 is effectively the curvature of @xmath112 , this complex projective space would degenerate to @xmath127 in the @xmath125 limit . extrapolating this intuition to our discrete qm",
    ", whose geometry is described by @xmath128 , the super - quantum limit would correspond to degenerating this projective space into @xmath129 .",
    "thus , the construction of a ` super ' version of discrete qm may require working in this space .",
    "another interesting avenue , already alluded to above , would be to use our discrete qm to explore the structure of the conjectured general geometric quantum theory @xcite .",
    "such a structure was argued to be relevant for quantum gravity . in particular , in that context , it was argued that non - linear grassmannian spaces are the natural generalization of complex projective spaces @xcite .",
    "it view of our proposal , it would be interesting to explore discrete analogs of non - linear grassmannians by replacing complex spaces with @xmath5-spaces .",
    "finally , since we have succeeded in constructing a qm on a space without an inner product , it can not be an essential gene necessary for the survival of a ` quantum ' theory .",
    "the absence of an inner product allows the vector and dual - vector spaces to be distinct , and our construction gives separate physical meanings to the two : the dual - vectors represent possible outcomes of a measurement , while the vectors represent the latent possibilities of a state .",
    "this removal of the required existence of an inner product potentially allows for the construction of quantum theories on spaces that have not heretofore been considered , _",
    "e.g. _ banach spaces .    we will explore these , and other related questions in upcoming publications @xcite .",
