    "being a subject of practical importance , elasto - plastic deformation of dense granular media has been under the focus of engineering research for many decades if not a century  @xcite .",
    "the state of geotechnical theories , however , remains confusing for outsiders : innumerable models compete , employing strikingly different expressions . in a recent book on soil mechanics , gudehus employed metaphors such as _ morass of equations _ and _ jungle of data _ to describe the situation  @xcite .",
    "granular dynamics is frequently modeled employing the strategy of _ rational mechanics _ , by postulating a function @xmath0 , such that the constitutive relation , @xmath1 holds , whereby @xmath0 is a function of the cauchy stress @xmath2 , strain rate @xmath3 ( the symmetric part of the velocity gradient ) and density @xmath4 .",
    "( more generally , @xmath5 is to be replaced by an objective derivative , such as jauman  here and below . )    together with mass and momentum conservation , it forms a closed set of equations for @xmath6 and the velocity @xmath7 .",
    "hypoplasticity  @xcite is such a theory , same as barodesy  @xcite . both use a single constitutive equation , without the recourse to yield or potential surfaces .",
    "although elasto - plastic theories are somewhat different , einav   showed that the latter can be seen as a special case of the former .",
    "all these models yield realistic accounts of the complex elasto - plastic motion , providing us with vast amount of highly condensed and intelligently organized empirical data .",
    "we concentrate on comparing gsh to hypoplasticity here , because elasto - plastic theories , with its case separations , are not easy to deal with analytically , and because a comparison to barodesy already exists  .",
    "typically , the _ hypoplastic model _ starts from the rate - independent constitutive relation , @xmath8 with @xmath9 and @xmath10 functions of stress and density .",
    "though continually improving functional dependence is being proposed for them , some known and systematic shortcomings remain :    1 .",
    "the applicability of hypoplasticity is confined to uniform systems .",
    "lacking a characteristic length scale , it does not account for shear band or evanescent creep flow ( ie .",
    "the exponentially decaying penetration of flows into the static region ) .",
    "there have been two main approaches to ameliorate this : introduction of gradient terms  @xcite , or addition of variables to account for the crosserat rotation and couple stress  @xcite .",
    "the latter works well , but leads to a rather more complex theory . and it provokes questions about the underlying physics : if couple stress is indeed important in the shear band , because it is fluid , why then is it not important in the uniformly fluid and gaseous state of granular media  or , coming to think of it , in nematic liquid crystals  @xcite ?",
    "2 .   in hypoplasticity ,",
    "rate - independence is an input .",
    "yet it is not a robust feature of granular behavior .",
    "fast dense flow is rate - dependent , as is the critical stress in the presence of external perturbations ( such as given by tapping ) .",
    "rate - independence needs to be explained , understood , and the extent to where it is valid clarified .",
    "elastic waves exist in granular media . yet if one tries to account for them employing eq.([3b-1 ] ) , one finds falsely that they should always be over - damped .",
    "more generally , granular media appear softer and more dissipative during elasto - plastic motion than in many other circumstances  foremost elastic waves , but also incremental stress - strain relations and ratcheting . focusing on the former , hypoplasticity struggles to account for any of the latter .",
    "( see however works on intergranular strains  @xcite . )",
    "fast dense flow and collisional flow are not accounted for .",
    "finally , hypoplasticity lacks energetics .",
    "one does not know whether a given state is stable because it has an energy minimum , or instable because the energy turns concave . nor do we know how much energy is being dissipated say in the critical state .",
    "moreover , @xmath11 has 36 elements , @xmath12 six , all functions of a tensor and a scalar .",
    "these are a lot of functions to choose .",
    "so it would be helpful if the second derivative of the energy were related to @xmath11 and/or @xmath12 ( contradicting in fact the name _ hypoplasticity _ ) .",
    "granular solid hydrodynamics ( gsh ) is derived from basic principles of physics , including conservation laws and the second law of thermodynamics , by employing _ the hydrodynamic procedure _",
    "the result is a continuum - mechanical theory  @xcite that leaves relatively little leeway , with a handful of scalar parameters to fit experiments .",
    "the most important one is the energy @xmath13 , chosen such , first of all , that elastic waves , incremental stress - strain relation and static stress distributions are well accounted for .",
    "second , @xmath13 contains the information that no stable static stress distribution exists if the density @xmath4 is too small for enduring contacts , or if the shear stress is too large for the given pressure .",
    "third , by reducing gsh to eq.([3b-1 ] ) for slow , uniform shear rates , @xmath13 s second derivative is found to yield @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the thermodynamic consistency of hypoplasticity has been demonstrated independently by fang et al , see @xcite .",
    "this was done generally , without specifying an expression for @xmath13 .",
    "the energy @xmath13 is taken as a function of the density @xmath4 , granular temperature @xmath14 and elastic strain @xmath15 .",
    "the state variable @xmath15 accounts for _ the slowly - varying , large - scaled elastic deformations of the grains , _ with the elastic stress given by the hyper - elastic relation ,",
    "@xmath16    the state variable @xmath14 quantifies _ the fast fluctuating elastic and kinetic energy of the grains_. it is frequently proportional to the shear rate , @xmath17 , and a useful indicator for the system s behavior , from the quasi - static via the dense flow to the collisional one .    for collisional and fast dense flow , with a shear rate of @xmath18/s and more ,",
    "there is vigorous jiggling and aggitation , so @xmath14 is obviously important . for elasto - plastic motion ( usually referred to as  quasi - static \"",
    "but see below ) , with shear rates around @xmath19/s , @xmath14 may seem irrelevant : aside from an occasional slip , grains only participate in the motion dictated by the macroscopic shear rate , with no perceptible deviations that may contribute to @xmath14 .",
    "nevertheless , such slips lead to vibrations in the region that imply a @xmath14 still many orders of magnitude larger than the true temperature of the grains .",
    "more importantly , as we shall see , these vibrations are what lead to plasticity .",
    "if @xmath20 is yet smaller , below @xmath21/s , gsh predicts a rate - dependent transition , to irrelevance of @xmath14 and diminishing plasticity .",
    "this is supported by recent experiments  @xcite . here",
    ", the system becomes truly quasi - static , better , _ quasi - elastic _ , until statics reigns , @xmath22 .    in",
    "what follows , we shall briefly present gsh in sec.[gsh ] , first its three coupled relaxation equations and an expression for the elastic energy , followed by a discussion of how best to understand @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and why a second @xmath14 for the fluctuating elastic energy alone is counter - productive . in sec.[hypoplastic motion ] , we obtain the critical state as the steady - state solution of the three relaxation equations .",
    "the approach to the state , for both high and low initial densities , is given by a simple analytic solution .",
    "in addition , gsh accounts for the variously observed fact that disturbing the critical state with some tapping , its stress becomes highly rate - dependent .",
    "we then compare gsh in detail to hypoplasticity and neo - hypoplasticity , and discuss how the observed proportional paths and goldscheider rule are natural results of gsh s equations . finally , we compare four more recently proposed elastic energies , showing that all four appear to agree well , though their second derivatives differ close to yield .",
    "in sec.[aging ] , we consider remifications of gsh if the stress is held constant , stressing the difference to rate - controlled experiments , explaining why a soft spring is useful for the latter , and a triaxial apparatus for the former .",
    "then we calculate creep , shear band , angle of repose and stability ( for the infinite , uniform geometry ) .",
    "finally , we demonstrate the similarity of gsh to kamrin s nonlocal kcr model .    in sec.[quasiela ]",
    ", we discuss the transition to the quasi - elastic regime for extremely slow rates .",
    "a complete set of state variables is one that uniquely determines a macroscopic state , including its energy and stress .",
    "gsh s state variables are the density @xmath4 , velocity @xmath23 , the granular temperature @xmath14 and the elastic strain @xmath15 .",
    "the latter two quantify , respectively , the temporally fluctuating elastic and kinetic energy of the grains and their slowly - varying large - scaled deformations .",
    "@xmath14 is increased by viscous heating @xmath24 , decreased by relaxation , and its balance equation is @xmath25,\\ ] ] with @xmath26 the relaxation rate , and @xmath27 accounting for @xmath14-diffusion .",
    "( the strain rate is @xmath28 , its traceless part @xmath29 , and @xmath30 . )",
    "@xmath31 is the  ambient temperature \" maintained by tapping or a sound field . for a steady , uniform @xmath32",
    ", we have @xmath33 implying @xmath34 if there is no external perturbation , and @xmath35 if the shear rate is zero . as is easy to see from eqs.([dot u],[dot u2 ] ) below",
    ", it is @xmath34 that leads to rate - independence .",
    "the easiest way to destroy it is therefore to introduce some @xmath31 , see sec.[external perturbation ] .",
    "the importance of @xmath14 in the collisional state is easy to accept .",
    "recent progresses show it exists equally in the turbulent flows of rapid dry granular avalanches  @xcite . that @xmath14 is relevant even in elasto - plastic motion",
    "may surprise , yet as already discussed in the introduction , this is a result of @xmath14 , many orders of magnitude larger than the true temperature , being the physics underlying plasticity , see the next few paragraphs .",
    "the elastic strain @xmath15 alone suffices to account for elasticity and plasticity . to understand this , one needs two steps : first , granular stresses relax with a variable relaxation time .",
    "second , this relaxation is closely related to plasticity .    the free surface of a granular system at rest is frequently tilted . when perturbed , when the grains jiggle and @xmath36 , the tilted surface will decay and become horizontal .",
    "the stronger the grains jiggle and slide , the faster the decay is .",
    "we take this as indicative of a system that is elastic for @xmath37 , transiently elastic for @xmath36 , with a stress relaxation rate @xmath38 .",
    "a relaxing stress is typical of any viscous - elastic or transiently elastic systems , such as polymers  @xcite . in granular media ,",
    "the relaxation rate is not a material constant , but a function of the state variable @xmath14  a behavior that we name _ variable transient elasticity_.    for given @xmath4 , the stress @xmath39 is a monotonic function of @xmath15 ( as long as the energy @xmath13 is stable and convex , @xmath40 ) .",
    "therefore , there is no principle difference in considering either relaxation . yet since strain is a geometric quantity , stress a physical one that includes material parameters such as the stiffness ( stress dependent and highly anisotropic in granular media ) , considering strain relaxation is simpler .",
    "we take the equation of motion for @xmath15 such to reflect _ variable transient elasticity _ , finding that it suffices to capture elasto - plasticity .",
    "starting from pure elasticity , @xmath41 , adding a relaxation term , @xmath42 , we allow for two tensorial coefficients , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , to parameterize the efficacy of relaxation and deformation rate , @xmath45 if stress anisotropy changes appreciably , convective terms ( or the so - called objective time derivative ) become important , then one needs the substitution ( see the derivation in  @xcite ) @xmath46 since @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , see eq.([fvs ] ) , this simple equation possesses the full hypoplastic structure , with @xmath49 given the equality of structure , gsh is as capable of accounting for elastoplasticity as hypoplasticity , if an appropriate energy expression can be found .",
    "( allowing the density to vary yields slightly more complicated expressions . ) next , dividing @xmath15 into its trace @xmath50 and traceless part @xmath51 , denoting @xmath52 , and specifying the two tensors with two elements each , @xmath53 , we arrive at @xmath54 which may equivalently be rewritten as two relaxation equations , @xmath55 , \\quad u_c\\equiv\\frac{1-\\alpha}{\\lambda f},\\,\\,\\frac{\\delta_c}{u_c}\\equiv\\frac{\\alpha_1}{\\lambda_1f } , \\\\\\label{eqd } \\partial_t\\delta&+(1-\\alpha)v_{\\ell\\ell}=-\\lambda_1t_g\\left[\\delta-\\delta_c\\hat v_{ij}\\hat u_{ij}\\frac{fv_s}{t_g}\\frac{u_s}{u_c}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] eqs.([tg2],[equ],[eqd ] ) are the three relaxation equations of gsh .",

    "the ( off - diagonal onsager ) coefficients @xmath68 , a necessary consequence of the same coefficients in eqs.([2c-7],[2c-8 ] ) , soften and mix the stress components .",
    "the term preceded by @xmath69 is smaller by one order in the small elastic strain @xmath15 and may usually be neglected ( though not in sec .  [ hypoplasticity ] ) .",
    "@xmath68 are functions of the density for elasto - plastic motion , though they vanish identically for static stresses , see  eq.([alphaela ] ) .",
    "the pressure @xmath70 is exerted by jiggling grains , and the last term is the viscous stress . both are @xmath71 for @xmath20 and relevant only for fast collisional and dense flows , giving rise to bagnold scaling there .",

    "it includes both _ stress - induced anisotropy _ and the _ convexity transition _",
    "( see below ) .",
    "in addition , the expression for the elastic stress @xmath79 has been validated for :    * static stress distribution in three classic geometries : silo , sand pile , point load on a granular sheet , calculated employing @xmath80 , see  @xcite . *",
    "incremental stress - strain relation at varying static stresses  @xcite . *",
    "propagation of anisotropic elastic waves at varying static stresses  @xcite .",
    "the gsh framework is general enough that one may employ any energy expression one deems appropriate .",
    "in fact , the above expression has been chosen for simplicity and manipulative ease , with a more realistic one given in  @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ constrel ] , we shall show and compare a number of different elastic energy expressions for realistic modeling .",
    "_ stress - induced anisotropy _ : in linear elasticity , @xmath81 , the velocity of elastic waves @xmath82 does not depend on @xmath83 , or equivalently , the stress .",
    "for any exponent other than two , the velocity depends on the stress , and is anisotropic if the stress is .",
    "_ convexity transition _ : there are values of stress and density in granular media for which elastic solutions do not exist : first , for densities smaller than the random loose packing density , @xmath84 , at which the grains start to loose contact with one another , no static elastic states can be maintained .",
    "second , static elastic states collapse when the shear stress is too large for the given pressure . on a tilted plane , the angle at which this happens is frequently referred to as the angle of stability , @xmath85 .",
    "the actually measured angle varies with the spacial dependence of the stress components and does not have a unique value .",
    "but in an infinite geometry , for uniform stresses , elastic solutions fail at a well - defined value .",
    "note that @xmath85 , accounting for collapses of static stresses at @xmath37 , is unrelated to the critical state , which exists only in the presence of a finite granular agitation , @xmath86 . in sec .",
    "[ sapc ] , we shall identify the angle of repose @xmath87 with the critical angle .",
    "again , the measured angle may vary because the stress is not uniform . in the space spanned by the density and stress components , the surface where the second derivative of the elastic energy changes its sign ( turning from convex to concave ) is a divide : on one side elastic solutions are stable , with grains at rest , on the other elastic solutions are instable , infinitesimal perturbations suffice to destroy any solution , and the grains are always agitated .",
    "the elastic energy of eq  ( [ 2b-2 ] ) is convex only for @xmath88 it turns concave when this condition is violated .",

    "the angle of stability @xmath85 ( for infinite geometry ) is reached when the energetic instability of eqs.([2b-3 ] ) is breached .",
    "with @xmath100 denoting the yield shear stress , it is @xmath101 modifications from the proximity to walls or floor are not included here .    for the parameterization of the coefficients @xmath102 , we need a second characteristic density , the _ random - close",

    "it is the highest density at which grains may remain uncompressed .",

    "this expression accounts for three granular characteristics :    * the elastic energy is concave for @xmath84 , rendering all elastic solutions instable . *",
    "the energy is convex between @xmath108 and @xmath103 , ensuring the stability of elastic solutions in this region .",
    "in addition , the density dependence of sound velocities ( as measured by harding and richart  @xcite ) is well rendered by an expression @xmath109 .",
    "( the usual formula used to report the resuslts of  @xcite implies an unphysically concave energy . ) * the elastic energy diverges , slowly , for @xmath110 , approximating the observation that the system becomes quite a bit stiffer there .",
    "because there is no space for granular rearrangements at the closed - packed density @xmath103 , plastic motions can not take place and the system should be fully elastic . taking @xmath111 for @xmath110 in eqs.([2c-7],[2c-8],[sigma ] ) , reduces gsh to simple elasticity , @xmath112 close to @xmath103 , the dependence on @xmath113 is more sensitive than any on @xmath4 directly . hence we take , with @xmath114 and @xmath115 : @xmath116 granular media should also be fully elastic for @xmath117 , see the discussion at the end of the introduction , and in sec.[quasiela ] . in this limit ,",
    "the stress increases steeply with the shear rate , until the yield stress is reached , at which point the system collapses .",
    "there is no stress relaxation , hence neither a critical state .      as @xmath14 and @xmath15 are novel variables that entail conceptual subtleties , a discussion is useful for those who want to look beyond the present equations .",
    "it is also useful because sun qichen and coworkers  @xcite have variously proposed a ",
    "twin - granular - temperature theory \" that we find necessary to comment on .      in a uniform medium",
    "( such as water or copper ) there are two length scales , macro- and microscopic .",
    "all degrees of freedom may be divided into one of the two groups .",
    "a hydrodynamic theory takes the degrees of freedom from the first group as explicit variables , including mass , momentum and energy density , also the strain field in the case of solids .",
    "all degrees of freedom from the second group are taken summarily , with their contribution to the energy lumped together as heat , and characterized by the temperature @xmath118 .    in granular media ,",
    "there is an intermediate group , consisting of momentum and deformation of each grain . in the kinetic theory or dem ,",
    "these are taken as independent variables . but",
    "a summary inclusion again suffices here , with the associated energy lumped into granular heat , characterized by @xmath14 .",
    "as the kinetic energy changes rapidly into an elastic one , and back , during a collision , both types of energy interact , equilibrate , and must be lumped into one single macroscopic variable @xmath14 . on the other hand ,",
    "distinguishing @xmath14 from @xmath118 is necessary : @xmath14 is many orders of magnitude higher than @xmath118 in elasto - plastic motion , and when this is the case , granular stress relaxes , giving rise , as discussed , to plasticity .",
    "there are also grain - sized deformations , such as in force chains , that are static or slowly varying in time .",
    "their contribution is not included in @xmath14 , but in that of @xmath15 , see below .",
    "accounting for the macroscopic elastic stress that varies slowly in space , the elastic strain is also slowly varying .",
    "as energy is positive and conserved , the macroscopic energy density @xmath13 is the sum of all ( slowly varying ) mesoscopic contributions , @xmath119 .",
    "in other words , @xmath13 is the coarse - grained mesoscopic one , @xmath120 , and since the latter includes the contribution from the force chains , the former also does .",
    "it is important to realize that the elastic strain can not be obtained by coarse - graining , @xmath121 .",
    "this is because both the energy and the elastic stress are coarse - grained quantities : @xmath120 and @xmath122 . with @xmath123 and @xmath124 ,",
    "we conclude : @xmath121 .",
    "sun and coworkers have written a number of papers  @xcite proposing a generalization of gsh by introducing two granular temperatures , @xmath125 and @xmath126 , with @xmath125 taking account of the kinetic , and @xmath126 the elastic energy ( including contributions from force chains ) .",
    "it should be clear from the last two sections that neither is a well - behaved macroscopic variable .",
    "the temporally fast varying elastic energy from collisional deformation is necessarily part of @xmath14 , while the slowly varying contribution from force chains are part of @xmath15 .      with the differential equations given and the energy density specified , gsh is a fairly well - defined theory .",
    "it contains clear ramifications and provides little leeway for retrospective adaptation to observations .",
    "as we shall see in the rest of the paper , a wide range of granular phenomena is well encoded in these equations .",
    "the three relaxation equations , ( [ tg2],[equ],[eqd ] ) , possess a steady state solution : @xmath60 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , which is simply the critical state .",
    "with it given , we may consider the relaxation dynamics  either at given shear rate , or holding the shear stress constant .",
    "in the first case , because of the small relaxation time @xmath127 , we have @xmath60 practically instantly , rendering @xmath14 dependent .",
    "then the strain relaxation equation is manifestly rate - independent , displaying the mathematical structure of hypoplasticity .",
    "the rich phenomenology observed in triaxial apparatus is then well accounted for by hypoplasticity and gsh alike .",
    "the relaxation dynamics at constant shear stresses gives rise to phenomena such as creeping , shear band , angle of repose  all beyond hypoplasticity .",
    "they are considered in sec.[aging ] .",
    "the physics of the critical state is : deformed grains give rise to an elastic stress .",
    "when grains are sheared past one another , they rattle and jiggle . and",
    "when they do , the deformation and stress is slowly lost , because of the loosen contact to their neighbors . as a consequence , a shear rate not only increases the deformation , as in any elastic medium , but also decreases it . a steady state exists in which both processes balance , such that the elastic deformation and stress remain constant over time .",
    "this is the critical state .",
    "moreover , the critical stress is rate - independent , because ( 1 )  the increase in deformation is @xmath128 , ( 2 )  the relaxation is @xmath38 , and ( 3 )  @xmath20 in @xmath14 s steady state .",

    "the stress value is obtained by inserting eqs.([cs1],[cs2 ] ) into eqs.([2b-2a],[2b-2b],[2b-1 ] ) , @xmath135 the loci of the critical states thus calculated   ( though employing the slightly more general energy of  @xcite ) greatly resembles those calculated using either hypoplasticity or barodesy  @xcite    same as the coulomb yield of eq  ( [ sb12 ] ) , the critical ratio @xmath136 is also frequently associated with a friction angle . since the former is relevant for vanishing @xmath14 , while the latter requires an moderately elevated @xmath20 , it is appropriate to identify one as the static friction angle , or yield angle , and the other as the dynamic one , or the critical angle . in sec .",
    "[ sapc ] , we shall present reasons why the critical angle should be identified with the angle of repose @xmath87 , the angle at which granular flows will come to a halt for uniform stress",
    ".    textbooks on soil mechanics frequently state that the friction angle is independent of the density  although they do not usually distinguish between the dynamic and the static one .",

    "it is useful , and quite demystifying , that a simple , analytical solution exists .    typically , we take @xmath143 , as the decay of @xmath83 and @xmath144 are faster than that of @xmath145",

    "in this section , we examine the ramification of gsh if , instead of the shear rate , the stress or elastic strain is being held constant . as we shall see , taking @xmath312 in eq.([equ ] ) results in a creep motion of the magnitude @xmath313 , such that an initial @xmath14 will co - relax with @xmath32 , at the altered rate @xmath314 .",
    "moreover , @xmath20 relax back to the equilibrium value @xmath315 only for @xmath316 , growing without bounds for @xmath317 , though a shear band solution is stable for @xmath317 .",
    "note hypoplasticity is not applicable here .",
    "this behavior has implications for the angle of repose @xmath87 ( for uniform stresses ) : as long as the shear stress is held below the critical one , @xmath316 , the @xmath20-relaxation will run its course , and the system is in a static , mechanically stable state afterwards . for @xmath318 , however , the system does not come to a standstill .",
    "therefore , defining @xmath87 same as in eq.([sb12 ] ) , but employing the critical rather than yield value , we have@xmath319 the inequality holds because the critical state is an elastic solution , while @xmath85 of eq.([sb12 ] ) is the angle at which all elastic solutions become unstable .",
    "stress - controlled experiments can not be performed in a conventional triaxial apparatus possessing stiff steel walls , because the correcting rates employed by the feedback loop to keep the stress constant are usually too strong . as a result",
    ", too much @xmath14 is excited that distorts its relaxation .",
    "the situation is then more one of consecutive constant rates , less of constant stress .",
    "instead , one may employ a soft spring to couple the granular system with its driving device , to enable small - amplitude stress corrections without exciting much @xmath14 .",
    "typical examples of stress - controlled experiments are creep ( both uniform in space and exponentially decreasing ) , shear band , also flow on an inclined plane or in a rotating drum .",
    "the flow either comes to a halt , becomes jammed at the angle of repose @xmath87 , or starts flowing from that jammed state , becomes fluidized at the angle of stability @xmath85 .      for @xmath37 , the system is static , @xmath320 const , and there is no dynamics , only a stable , static elastic solution .",
    "but if @xmath36 initially , both @xmath14 and the elastic strain will relax according to eqs.([tg2],[equ],[eqd ] ) , and with them also the stress @xmath321 . maintaining a constant @xmath83 , or @xmath321 , therefore requires a compensating shear rate @xmath32 , which is observed as creep . as we shall see , the characteristic time of @xmath14 is then @xmath322 , hence rather long close to the critical stress .",
    "so the accumulated shear strain @xmath323 can be expected to be large .    in a recent experiment involving a fan submerged in sand , nguyen et al .",
    "@xcite pushed the system to a certain shear stress at a given ( and fairly fast ) rate , producing an elevated @xmath14 .",

    "usually , triaxial apparatus with stiff steel walls and a feedback loop is used to keep the stress constant .",
    "the correcting rates are strong , and much @xmath14 is excited that distorts its relaxation .",

    "a soft spring coupling the granular system with its driving device has much lower correcting rates .    because of the fan",

    "nevertheless , the experiment s new and structurally robust results are worth closer scrutiny . and we shall employ gsh assuming uniformity to yield a qualitative understanding . also , we shall assume it is the elastic shear strain @xmath83 that is being kept constant , not the shear stress @xmath325 , as both cases will turn out to be rather similar .",
    "the relevant equations are still eqs  ( [ tg2],[equ],[eqd ] ) ( with @xmath170 ) .    at the beginning , as the strain is being ramped up to @xmath83 employing the constant rate @xmath326 , granular temperature acquires the initial value @xmath327 . starting at the time @xmath328 ,",

    "the solution to the second equation is @xmath336 because of eq  ( [ 3b-7a ] ) , the same solution also holds for the shear rate , @xmath337 , with @xmath338 , @xmath339 , implying a logarithmically divergent total shear strain , @xmath340 however , we note that @xmath341 does not actually diverge , because as @xmath117 , it enters the quasi - elastic regime , see eq.([elatran ] ) below , where its relaxation becomes exponential .",

    "hence the angle of repose ( for uniform stress ) is @xmath369 , see eq.([dynfriang ] . given a static elastic state on a plane inclined by the angle @xmath91 , the angle of stability @xmath85 ( again for uniform stress ) is reached when the energetic instability of eqs.([2b-3 ] ) is breached , and the static elastic state collapses .",
    "therefore , @xmath370 , see eq.([sb12 ] ) .",
    "finally , we consider the coexistence between fast dense flow , @xmath60 , and one of static elastic stress , @xmath315 .",
    "some @xmath14 will diffuse into the static region , giving rise to an exponentially decreasing creep , as observed by komatsu et al  @xcite , crassous et al  @xcite .",
    "we take this  liquid - solid boundary \" to be at @xmath371 , with @xmath372 being solid . in the fluid phase @xmath373 ,",
    "the shear rate is a constant , as is @xmath14 , providing the boundary conditions for the solid part .",
    "pressure @xmath147 and shear stress @xmath321 are uniform , as is @xmath374 , but @xmath4 is discontinuous at @xmath371 , though constant otherwise .",
    "( the liquid density needs to be lower than that of the solid one , such that the same stress exceeds the critical one in the liquid , but is below it in the solid . )",
    "the variable @xmath60 varies along @xmath375 .",
    "these circumstances are similar to that of sec  [ tgrelaxation ] , though variation is in space rather than time . given stationarity of eqs  ( [ equ],[eqd ] ) , we have @xmath376 see eqs.([3b-7a],[3b-11 ] ) .",
    "with @xmath149 fixed , so are @xmath201 , where especially @xmath377 if @xmath349 .",

    "since @xmath379 increases monotonically with @xmath380 , see eq.([2b-1 ] ) , the friction @xmath381 decreases for increasing @xmath382 .    the balance equation for @xmath14 with @xmath357 , see eq.([3b-9 ] ) , yields an evanescent creep , @xmath383 , \\\\\\label{cr2 } v_s / v_s^{0}&= t_g / t_g^{0}= \\exp(-x/\\xi_{cr}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( @xmath384 and @xmath385are the liquid values at @xmath371 .",
    ") that the decay length @xmath386 diverges for @xmath349 is not surprising , because the whole solid region turns critical then .",
    "kamrin et al  @xcite proposed a constitutive relation ( kcr ) to account for the steady flow in the split - bottom cell  @xcite .",
    "a key ingredient of the theory is a new variable _ fluidity _ : @xmath387 , with @xmath388 and @xmath389 .",
    "it is taken to obey the equation @xmath390 as @xmath391 for @xmath392 , this relation is rather similar to eq.([cr1 ] ) , with @xmath393 assuming the role of @xmath14 , and the decay length diverging at the critical stress . for @xmath394 ,",
    "the system is fluid , and @xmath395 essentially constant .",
    "again , @xmath14 is constant in the liquid region .",
    "kcr is well capable of accounting for the steady flow in the split - bottom cell .",
    "this is fortunate , because again , there is a symbiotic relation relation between gsh and kcr , similar to that between gsh and hypoplasticity .",
    "but there are also three differences .",
    "first , kcr assumes @xmath317 in the liquid and @xmath316 in the solid , with @xmath348 a constant .",
    "this violates momentum conservation , as the stress is continuous across the solid - fluid interface ( see also the discussion in sec.[nsb ] and [ creep motion ] ) .",
    "second , we have , for gsh , @xmath396 in liquid , and @xmath397 in solid ; yet @xmath398 on both sides for kcr .",
    "third , kamrin and bouchbinder constructed a `` two - temperature continuous mechanics '' in a recent paper  @xcite , defining a configuration temperature @xmath399 and one for the vibrational degrees of freedom @xmath400 .",
    "( microscopic degrees of freedom are not considered",
    ". there would be three temperatures if one did . )",
    "they hypothesize that the fluidity @xmath393 may be related to @xmath399 .",
    "we disagree here . as discussed above , @xmath393 is essentially @xmath14 of gsh , which is closer to @xmath400 .",
    "_ quasi - static _ is what many in soil mechanics call the rate - independent elasto - plastic motion .",
    "the implication is : being the slowest one possible , elasto - plastic motion stays as is however slow the rate .",
    "we believe there is , at very small @xmath14 and very low rates  possibly @xmath401/s , or @xmath402 ( where @xmath403 is the inertial number of the @xmath404 rheology ) , _ a rate - dependent transition to another rate - independent regime . _ if true , only the latter should be called quasi - static , or _",
    "quasi - elastic_. the reasons for our believe are the following six points [ see also sec.[elasticlimit ] and the list after eq.([2b-1 ] ) ] :    1 .",
    "we have @xmath37 in static stress distributions , which is well accounted for by the fully elastic eqs.([sigmaela ] ) .",
    "this should remain so for very slow stress changes .",
    "the fact that cyclic load or ratcheting are less dissipative than hypoplasticity predicts  @xcite may well be interpreted as the onset of a transition to quasi - elasticity .",
    "one does not need to invoke intergranular strain here .",
    "3 .   quasi - static motion  a consecutive visit of static , equilibrium states",
    " should occur at @xmath37 , and be reversible .",
    "yet elasto - plastic motion occurs at elevated @xmath14 , is strongly dissipative and irreversible .",
    "reactive and dissipative terms are comparable in size , being exactly equal in the critical state .",
    "( this is obvious only within the context of gsh , but one can identify the reactive and dissipative terms in hypoplasticity by comparing it to gsh .",
    "then the same holds true there . )",
    "rate - independence is a hallmark of quasi - static motion .",
    "yet the rate - independence of elasto - plastic motion is ( as discussed in sec.[external perturbation ] ) easily destroyed .",
    "@xmath14 is essentially zero in elastic waves , since there is not enough time to excite appreciable amount of it .",
    "waves are well accounted for by the elastic eqs.([sigmaela ] ) , but not by hypoplasticity  as they should if there were only the elasto - plastic regime .",
    "employing hypoplasticity , one finds that waves are always over - damped : starting from momentum conservation , @xmath405 , or @xmath406 , one inserts eq.([3b-1 ] ) to find the term @xmath407 yielding the velocity and the one @xmath408 damping . both terms are of the same order in @xmath409 , and given the values of the two tensors appropriate for elasto - plastic motion , they are also comparable in size , implying that elastic waves are always over - damped .",
    "( in solids , the damping term is an order in the wave vector @xmath409 higher than the velocity term , rendering it much smaller for long enough wave lengths .",
    "this is the reason elastic waves propagate there . ) .",
    "in fact , elastic waves are a fast yet quasi - static phenomenon , same as incremental stress - strain relations .",
    "6 .   happily and perhaps most convincingly , peng zhen et al .",
    "have most recently observed indications of a rate - dependent transition away from the elasto - plastic regime  @xcite .",
    "faced with the quasi - elastic response of sound waves and ratcheting , a frequent suggestion is to take a small strain increment to be elastic and free of dissipation , but a large one as elasto - plastic and dissipative .",
    "unfortunately , this is not compatible with the notion of quasi - static motion , a consecutive visit of equilibrium , static states : starting from an arbitrary static state of given stress , applying a small incremental strain that is elastic , the system ends up in another static state , with a slightly higher stress .",
    "this second state , as static as the first , is again a valid starting point ",
    "any static state is . and",
    "the next small increment must again be elastic .",
    "many consecutive small increments yield a large change in strain , and if the small ones are not dissipative , neither can their sum be .    in gsh , it is the strain rate , not the strain amplitude , that decides whether the response is elastic or elasto - plastic .",
    "small strain increments produced with a brief puls of shear rate will produce an elastic response , if @xmath14 does not have time to get to a sufficiently high value .",
    "there are at least two ways to observe the elusive quasi - elastic behavior , both by fixing the stress rate and keeping a low @xmath14 : note that a given stress rate may be associated with either of two shear rates , a high , elasto - plastic one at elevated @xmath14 and a low , elastic one at vanishing @xmath14 .",
    "the first method is to slowly incline a plane supporting a layer of grains .",
    "in such a situation , the shear rate remains very small , and the system starts flowing only when the yield stress is breached .    a second method is to insert a soft spring between the granular medium and the driving device . if the spring is softer by a large factor @xmath212 than the granular medium ( which is itself rather soft ) , it will serve as a `` stress reservoir , '' and absorb most of the displacement , leaving the granular medium deforming at a rate smaller by the same factor @xmath212 .",
    "( employing a feedback loop in a triaxial apparatus with stiff steel walls to maintain a stress rate will not usually work , because the correcting motion typically has strain rates that are so high , that the system slips into an elasto - plastic motion quickly . )      to account for the transition to quasi - elasticity , we need to specify how , in eqs.([2c-7],[2c-8],[sigma ] ) , @xmath410 vanish .",
    "there are scant data to rely on , but one possibility would be @xmath411 for @xmath412 , we have @xmath413 , ensuring rate - independence for the elassto - plastic regime ; for @xmath414 , we have @xmath415 vanishing with @xmath14 .    instead of taking @xmath416 with @xmath14",
    ", we choose to generalize @xmath417 to @xmath418 because this was a natural result arising during the derivation of gsh , see  @xcite . for @xmath419",
    ", we have @xmath420 quadratically small in @xmath32 , and with it also the relaxation rates @xmath38 .",
    "the ratio , in eqs.([2c-7],[2c-8 ] ) , between the irreversible , plastic term ( @xmath71 ) and the reversible , elastic term ( @xmath128 ) diminishes with @xmath421 , as has been observed in dem  @xcite .",
    "taking the stress increment as a function of density , strain rate and the stress itself , the eq.(1 ) this paper starts from to set up a constitutive model , is an appropriate and physically sound way to come to terms with the complexity of triaxial results .",
    "a rather broader view of granular behavior are captured by introducing a pair of internal state variables , the elastic strain field @xmath15 and the granular temperature @xmath14 , with the first accounting for the coarse - grained deformation of the grains , and the latter accounting for their quickly changing elastic and kinetic energy .",
    "the theory that does it is called gsh , and the phenomena accounted for include static stress distributions , creep , shear band , angle of repose and stability , also the critical state under tapping , all in addition to the trixial results .",
