    "even though theories of strong interactions have been with us for about forty years there are still many outstanding questions that need to be answered .",
    "for instance we still lack a complete understanding of such phenomena as confinement , chiral symmetry breaking and infrared fixed points with associated conformal behavior .",
    "solving strongly interacting theories would not only yield a complete understanding of quantum chromo dynamics ( qcd ) but would also provide invaluable assistance to the search for possible physics beyond the standard model . for a review on these aspects see for instance @xcite .",
    "strong interactions also have the potential to exhibit another interesting dynamical phenomena as first noted by dashen @xcite .",
    "it is quite amusing to note that even before the discovery of qcd he had observed that under special circumstances the combination of charge conjugation and parity ( cp ) could potentially be spontaneously broken @xcite .",
    "it was discovered that by appropriate choices of the masses of the quarks the vacuum could align in a direction in which cp was broken .",
    "specifically for three quark flavors if the strange quark mass become sufficiently negative the vacuum will pick up nontrivial complex phases and cp will be broken .",
    "a cp violating phase can also materialize for only two quark flavors as emphasized by m. creutz and collaborators @xcite . here",
    "it is found that once the mass of the down quark become equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the mass of the up quark a vacuum degeneracy appears signaling that the nambu - goldstone bosons have become massless . at this point",
    "it has been suggested that the neutral nambu - goldstone boson ( the neutral pion ) , being odd under cp , might condense and spontaneously break cp @xcite .",
    "for both two and three quark flavors the spontaneous cp violation is a consequence of the alignment of the vacuum by an ( external ) perturbation , i.e. the mass term .",
    "it is only natural to ask whether this persists if we slowly change the various parameters of qcd .",
    "first , since vector - like gauge theories with a set of massless fermions in an arbitrary complex representation of the gauge group have the same global chiral symmetry all such systems must share the phenomena of spontaneous cp violation in a manner identical to qcd .",
    "second , it was recently shown that in the four flavor case there is a region similar to the three flavor case in which cp is violated @xcite .",
    "in fact for any number of flavors @xmath4 one can show that for appropriately tuned external mass perturbations cp will break spontaneously @xcite .    in this work",
    "we intend to change yet another set of parameters and search for cp violation . instead of assuming that the fermions belong to a complex representation of the gauge group we shall turn our attention to two dirac flavors in a _",
    "real _ and _ pseudoreal _ representation .",
    "this has the immediate effect of enhancing the global symmetry of the theory and therefore it could potentially lead to a different dynamical behavior . loosely speaking",
    "we will find that once we add a mass perturbation for the two dirac fermions and drive the vacuum in different directions the system always has the freedom ( due to the _ enhanced _ global symmetry ) to choose a vacuum in which cp is preserved .",
    "the behavior is quite novel since the system makes a discontinuous jump from one vacuum to another as we dial the masses from positive / negative to negative / positive values . in other words",
    "if we try to force the system into a cp violating phase it responds by jumping into a vacuum in which cp is preserved and hence where a fewer number of symmetries are broken .",
    "examples of theories that fall under our general considerations are @xmath5 gauge theories with @xmath6 massless fermions in either the fundamental ( pseudoreal ) representation or the three dimensional adjoint ( real ) representation . besides being playgrounds for studying modifications of qcd these theories are also the basis for a great number of attempts to build realistic technicolor models able to explain electroweak symmetry breaking in a natural way @xcite .",
    "this is yet another strong motivation for our work .",
    "situations where the alignment of the vacuum is produced by other perturbations than mass perturbations have also been investigated in the context of technicolor theories .",
    "specifically the question as to how the gauging of the electroweak symmetry , which explicitly breaks the global symmetry , aligns the vacuum @xcite .",
    "in addition some years ago it was suggested that the observed cp violation in the standard model could be accounted for in ( extended ) technicolor theories @xcite .",
    "here quarks and techniquarks are coupled via four fermion interactions and in this way alignment in the techniquark sector would determine the alignment in the quark sector .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : va ] we discuss vacuum alignment in general terms .",
    "we also discuss the discrete symmetries c and p for fermions in a real or pseudoreal representation of the gauge group . in section",
    "[ sec : real ] and [ sec : pseudoreal ] we present our results for the theory with two dirac fermions in a real representation and pseudoreal of the gauge group .",
    "we then conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "as our starting point we consider vector - like gauge theories with a set of massless fermions belonging to some irreducible representation of the gauge group .",
    "the specific situation where the gauge group is @xmath7 and the representation is the fundamental representation corresponds to massless qcd with some number of flavors .",
    "in general such gauge theories with a fermionic matter sector have a global continuous symmetry that depends on the representation to which the fermions belong . if the representation is complex the global symmetry is @xmath8 and if the representation is real or pseudoreal the global symmetry is enhanced to @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "here @xmath4 counts the number of dirac fermions @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are respectively a left - handed and right - handed weyl fermion .",
    "the abelian @xmath13 is the standard baryon number and is anomaly free .",
    "the reason for the appearance of the enhanced symmetry when the representation is real or pseudoreal is due to the fact that one can always write a right - handed weyl fermion in a given representation as a left - handed weyl fermion in the conjugated representation .",
    "then if the representation is real or pseudoreal the conjugated representation is equivalent to the representation itself .",
    "hence if we have @xmath4 dirac fermions we can consider them as @xmath14 left - handed weyl fermions @xmath15 all in the same real or pseudoreal representation .",
    "from now on we shall omit the subscript @xmath16 and always take the weyl fermions @xmath17 to be left - handed .",
    "gauge theories may also posses the discrete symmetries charge conjugation c , parity p and time reversal t or any combination hereof .",
    "charge conjugation exchanges a particle with its antiparticle or vice versa while parity changes the chirality of a particle . for dirac fermions in a complex representation of the gauge group these discrete symmetries",
    "are implemented in standard fashion and can be found for instance in the appendix of @xcite .    for",
    "a set of fermions @xmath17 belonging to a real or pseudoreal representation of the gauge group one might first expect them to be majorana , i.e. that they are equal to their own antiparticles .",
    "this follows from the fact that charge conjugation involves a complex conjugation of the fermion fields and the reality or pseudoreality of the fermion representation .",
    "however they also transform as a fundamental under global @xmath18 and for @xmath19 this is a complex representation . hence under charge conjugation ,",
    "in which complex conjugation occurs , these fermions can not be transformed into them selves . instead under charge conjugation and parity we must consider them in the dirac basis in which the implementation of all the discrete symmetries are known .",
    "next consider theories that are asymptotically free and assume that as the energy scale is lowered the gauge interactions become strong such that a bilinear condensate is formed spontaneously breaking the continuous global symmetry @xmath20 to some subgroup @xmath21 .",
    "even though the hamiltonian @xmath22 of the system is invariant under all transformations of @xmath20 the vacuum is only invariant under transformations of @xmath21 .",
    "there is a degeneracy of vacua all parameterized by the elements that belong to @xmath20 but not to @xmath21 . as is well known this degeneracy is manifested in the appearance of a set of nambu - goldstone bosons .",
    "if we add a small perturbation @xmath23 to the system explicitly breaking the global symmetry @xmath20 the vacuum degeneracy will be lifted and the vacuum will become _ aligned _ with the explicit symmetry breaking perturbation . in order to find the aligned ( correct ) vacuum that is left over we must minimize the total energy @xmath24 over all vacua @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 is some standard reference vacuum .",
    "it should be clear that the contribution @xmath28 is just a constant since the unperturbed hamiltonian is symmetric under all transformations .",
    "hence we can simplify the procedure of finding the aligned vacuum by considering the minimization of only the perturbation @xmath29 it should be noted that we can view the minimization in two different ways : either we find the rotated vacuum @xmath30 that minimizes the energy or we find the rotated hamiltonian @xmath31 that is compatible with the reference vacuum @xmath27 .",
    "the two views are equivalent .",
    "as one of our main examples we will consider two massless dirac fermions denoted as @xmath32 ( up ) and @xmath33 ( down ) transforming according to a real representation of the gauge group . from the above discussion this is equivalent to four weyl fermions all transforming according to the same real representation @xmath34 the weyl fermions @xmath35 are all treated as left - handed fields .",
    "we have also suppressed the gauge index .",
    "the theory enjoys an @xmath36 global symmetry in which the four weyl fields are rotated among each other .",
    "assume now that the gauge interactions become strong such that the following condensate is formed @xcite @xmath37 where for brevity we have defined @xmath38 . in terms of the up and down fermion fields we can also write the condensate in the standard form @xmath39 by contracting the flavor indices with @xmath40 .",
    "this justifies our choice of the specific reference vacuum @xmath41 since here the condensate is particularly simple .",
    "also the notation is such that @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "since the condensate is symmetric in its indices it is invariant only under @xmath44 transformations and therefore spontaneously breaks the @xmath36 global symmetry .",
    "this spontaneous symmetry breaking leads to the well known appearance of @xmath45 nambu - goldstone bosons .",
    "let us try to force the vacuum in a different direction by adding a small mass term .",
    "such a perturbation explicitly breaks the @xmath36 global symmetry , lifts the vacuum degeneracy and provides the nambu - goldstone bosons with a mass . to be concrete assume that a dirac mass term is added to the theory @xmath46 here the dirac mass matrix is symmetric and each entry @xmath0 and @xmath1 are taken to be real such that it preserves cp . in order to find the correct aligned vacuum we need to follow the above steps of minimizing the energy @xmath47\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the rotated vacuum is @xmath48 and @xmath26 .",
    "we must find the rotated ( aligned ) vacuum @xmath49 that minimizes the energy . to this end",
    "we first note that @xmath49 must be of the same form as the dirac mass matrix since the energy involves a trace .",
    "second we note that the vacuum must be symmetric since the reference vacuum @xmath41 is symmetric .",
    "in addition it must be unitary and can therefore only depend on two phases @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "lastly since the vacuum must have unit determinant the two angles must up to a multiple of @xmath52 .",
    "putting it all together we find that the aligned vacuum must be of the form @xmath53 where @xmath54 is some integer number .",
    "it is important to observe that the angles should add up to _ any _ multiple of @xmath52 .",
    "this is in contrast to the case where the fermions belong to a complex representation of the gauge group @xcite . here",
    "the vacuum angles must add up to an _ even _ multiple of @xmath52 . as we shall see below this has a major impact on the behavior of the system as we vary the fermion masses aligning the vacuum in different directions .",
    "this differece is a direct consequence of the enhanced global symmetry",
    ".    it should be clear that without loss of generality we can take @xmath55 or @xmath56 . in this way we can speak about two different branches of the system in which the energy is",
    "@xmath57 we want to minimize the energy over the vacuum angle @xmath58 .",
    "the location of the minima depends on the sign of the up and down fermion masses .",
    "if both fermion masses have the same sign the minima are located on the @xmath55 branch .",
    "if they are both positive they are found at @xmath58 being equal to an even multiple of @xmath52 and if they are both negative they are found at @xmath58 being equal to an odd multiple of @xmath52 . on the other hand",
    "the fermion masses might also differ in sign . in that case",
    "the minima are located on the @xmath56 branch .",
    "if the up fermion mass is positive and the down fermion mass is negative then the minima are found at @xmath58 being equal to an even multiple of @xmath52 while in the opposite case where the up fermion mass is negative and the down fermion mass is positive the minima are found at @xmath58 being equal to an odd multiple of @xmath52 . summarizing",
    "we therefore find that the aligned vacuum is @xmath59    we are now in a position to study the response of the system to the external mass perturbation .",
    "first imagine that both up and down explicit fermion mass terms @xmath0 and @xmath1 are positive .",
    "then the system must be found to reside in the single unique vacuum @xmath60 which is on the @xmath55 branch .",
    "this is for arbitrary positive values @xmath61 .",
    "let us now fix @xmath0 and slowly dial the down fermion mass @xmath1 towards zero .",
    "as the down fermion mass passes through the critical value @xmath62 the system becomes discretely degenerate and a new additional vacuum @xmath63 appears on the @xmath56 branch . if we continue to decrease the down fermion mass to negative values the discrete degeneracy disappears and the vacuum of the system uniquely becomes @xmath63 .",
    "nothing is then expected to further happen for any negative value @xmath64 .",
    "what has happened is quite novel since the system must have gone through a discontinuous jump at the critical value where the down fermion mass vanishes .",
    "as we cross the critical value the system must respond by jumping from the @xmath55 branch to the @xmath56 branch .",
    "it should be clear that the above discontinuous behavior occurs for an arbitrary magnitude and sign of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "it does not matter whether @xmath0 and @xmath1 initially are positive or negative .",
    "if we fix one of them and dial the other then as the second mass passes through zero the system must perform a discontinuous jump from the @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) branch to the @xmath56 ( @xmath55 ) branch . in fig .",
    "[ realplot ] we plot the vacuum structure in terms of the up and down explicit fermion mass .",
    "and @xmath65 ) as function of the up and down mass @xmath0 and @xmath1 with two dirac flavors in a real representation of the gauge group .",
    "when crossing from one vacuum into another the system makes a discontinuous jump .",
    "blue corresponds to the @xmath55 branch while red corresponds to the @xmath56 branch . ]",
    "irrespective of which of the four vacua the system resides in the continuous global symmetry @xmath36 is broken to @xmath44 .",
    "symmetry can be checked by using the generators found @xcite . ]",
    "the embedding ( or direction ) of the @xmath44 subgroup of course depends on the specific vacuum .",
    "note also that in all four vacua there are no nontrivial complex phases . in this way",
    "discrete cp symmetry is preserved for arbitrary mass perturbations , i.e. we can not drive the vacuum into a direction in which cp is spontaneously broken .",
    "let us contrast this to the case where the fermions are in a complex representation of the gauge group and for which the continuous global symmetry is @xmath66 .",
    "we will discuss the two flavor case since this is the situation that mimics our example above @xcite .",
    "however as we shall see there are crucial differences .",
    "consider therefore two dirac flavors , up and down , in a complex representation of the gauge group and take their mass perturbations to be positive .",
    "the vacuum is then aligned in the direction @xmath67 .",
    "but if we fix the up fermion mass and slowly dial the down fermion mass towards zero no new vacua appear @xcite .",
    "one might naively have expected that the system would choose the vacuum @xmath68 but this does not have unit determinant so it is not a possibility .",
    "instead the vacuum continues to be @xmath67 until the critical point where the up and down fermion masses are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign is encountered .",
    "the vacuum is here forced to take complex values @xmath69 where @xmath70 is some arbitrary angle .",
    "again it can not be driven in the direction @xmath68 since it does not have unit determinant .",
    "instead a continuous vacuum degeneracy appears indicating that the nambu - goldstone bosons have once again become massless . at this critical point",
    "it has been suggested that the neutral nambu - goldstone boson ( the neutral pion ) , being odd under cp , develops a vev spontaneously breaking cp @xcite .",
    "this is the dashen phase . for completeness",
    "we note that as the down fermion mass passes the critical point and decreases even further the vacuum is aligned in the direction @xmath71 and the vacuum degeneracy disappears .",
    "this differs in essential aspects from the case where the fermions belong to a real representation of the gauge group and the system has an enhanced global symmetry . here",
    "we find no evidence for the existence of a dashen type phase .",
    "technically it is due to the fact that the system has two different branches @xmath55 and @xmath56 and that as we dial the fermion masses the system can undergo discontinuous jumps from one branch to another .",
    "if we for the moment imagine that the system did not have the @xmath56 branch then the behavior would be just as in the case where the fermion representation is complex . as we pass the down fermion mass through zero nothing",
    "is expected to happen . then again at the point where the down and up fermion masses are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign a vacuum degeneracy appears since the energy of the system vanishes identically for any value of the vacuum angles . here",
    "the nambu - goldstone bosons become massless and via a mechanism similar to the case for complex representations where the neutral one develops a vev could break cp spontaneously .",
    "however this is not observed .",
    "in this section we complete our study by considering a similar setup as above but with fermions belonging to a pseudoreal representation of the gauge group .",
    "we again take two dirac flavors and arrange them into a set of left - handed transforming fermions @xmath72 .",
    "the theory enjoys a continuous global symmetry @xmath73 and a set of discrete symmetries . as above",
    "we imagine that at some energy scale the gauge interactions become strong and the following condensate is formed @xmath74 since the condensate is antisymmetric in its indices it leaves invariant only a @xmath75 subgroup .",
    "hence it breaks the continuous global symmetry spontaneously and is the source for the appearance of @xmath76 nambu - goldstone bosons .",
    "note again that if we write @xmath17 in terms of the two dirac fermions as in eq .",
    "[ eq : lambda ] the condensate can be written as @xmath77 justifying our choice of the reference vacuum @xmath41 since the condensate is here particularly simple . adding to the theory the following explicit dirac mass term @xmath78 we want to find the rotated vacuum @xmath79 that minimizes the energy @xmath80 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] both the up and down fermion mass terms @xmath0 and @xmath1 are taken to be real . via a similar line of arguments as in the case with a real fermion representation we find that the rotated vacuum depends on two angles @xmath58 and @xmath81 that adds to a multiple of @xmath52 and be of the form @xmath82 again there are two different branches corresponding to @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "all other branches are equivalent to one of these .",
    "hence we want to minimize @xmath83 over the vacuum angle @xmath58 . depending on the sign of the up and down fermion masses the minima",
    "are located at the same values of the vacuum angles as in the case with a real fermion representation @xmath84 the behavior is identical to the case of a real fermion representation .",
    "if we fix the mass of one of the fermions and dial the other one then at the critical point where it vanishes the system makes a discontinuous jump from one branch to the other .",
    "there is no critical point where all the nambu - goldstone bosons become massless with a vacuum degeneracy reappearing .",
    "hence it is not possible with a dashen type phase where cp is spontaneously broken when the fermions belong to a pseudoreal representation of the gauge group .",
    "we investigated the vacuum structure of fermionic gauge theories with two dirac favors by adding a small explicit mass perturbation .",
    "we picked the fermions to transform according to a real or pseudoreal representation of the gauge group . by dialing the explicit masses we studied how the vacuum aligned in different directions .",
    "we were motivated by the fact that when the fermions are in a complex representation of the gauge group the system has the potential to develop a so called dashen phase where cp is spontaneously broken .",
    "we found that this is not an option if one considers theories with enhanced global symmetries . in some sense",
    "the global symmetry is so large that if one attempts to force the system in a cp violating direction it has the freedom to align in a direction in which cp is preserved . in other words",
    "the system prefers to break the least number of symmetries .",
