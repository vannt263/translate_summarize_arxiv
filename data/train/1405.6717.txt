    "_ sarang gopalakrishnan , colin v. parker , and eugene demler _    in what follows , we introduce two self - consistent approaches to computing the bound state energy and the impurity effective mass .",
    "first , we discuss an approach that is tailored for light impurities in three ( or two ) dimensions , and yields good results in both the weak and strong coupling limits ; next , we turn to the one - dimensional case and discuss an approach that is reliable across the parity - changing transition whenever the impurity is sufficiently massive . together , these approaches support the physical argument in the main text that the parity - changing transition should not be accompanied by any divergences , as it is strongly first - order .",
    "in this section we begin with the hamiltonian [ eq .",
    "( 1 ) of main text ] and compute the impurity - fermion t - matrix treating the bcs coherence factors [ eq .  ( 2 ) of main text ] _ exactly _ rather than approximately .",
    "this allows us to estimate the transition between the phase in which the molecule is an excited state and that in which the molecule is the ground state .        in general the t - matrix for impurity - quasiparticle scattering is given in the ladder approximation by the equation    [ ladder1 ] ( ) = + ( ) where the hats denote nambu matrix structure ; matrix multiplication is implied ; @xmath93 is the interaction ; @xmath94 is the bare fermion ( i.e. , @xmath95 ) propagator ; and @xmath96 is the impurity propagator ,    [ impprop ] ( , ) = (    cc - v_f ( q - k_f ) & + & + v_f ( q - k_f )    ) ; d ( , ) = . to find the parity transition we need to find the poles in @xmath97",
    "once @xmath98 is integrated over we have    [ suppt ] dq d^d-1 k (    cc - v_f ( q - k_f ) & + & + v_f ( q - k_f )    ) .",
    "where @xmath66 is the direction normal to the fermi surface and @xmath99 denotes all other directions .",
    "in this expression we have assumed that @xmath100 , i.e. , we neglect the change in curvature of the bogoliubov dispersion minimum .",
    "this inequality is equivalent to requiring @xmath101 , which is always satisfied in the bcs limit .",
    "we extract the @xmath3-dependence from this integral by substituting the variable @xmath102 .",
    "one sees then that the integral is given by @xmath103 , where the latter function depends exclusively on fermionic parameters and not on @xmath3 .",
    "the remaining integral is formally divergent , but this divergence can be eliminated , and @xmath104 can be determined , if one requires the bound state energy to go smoothly to its infinite - mass limit .",
    "this yields the result in the main text .",
    "we now turn to the effective mass @xmath68 of the impurity at strong coupling .",
    "we make two assumptions : ( i )  that the superfluid is in the bcs limit , so that @xmath89 is much greater than any other energy scale in the problem ; ( ii )  that the impurity is sufficiently light that its renormalized recoil energy @xmath105 remains greater than the coupling scale . condition ( ii ) will be checked for self - consistency at the end of the calculation . when conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) are satisfied , the effective mass can be computed for arbitrary coupling if one replaces the bare interaction vertex with the t - matrix and resums the diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ tmatro ] . these diagrams",
    "dominate because , in the light - impurity and bcs limits , the impurity can only emit and absorb pairs of quasiparticles with nearly opposite momenta .",
    "the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ tmatro ] , in which successive each quasiparticle pair can lie anywhere on the dispersion minimum , are parametrically more important ( by a factor @xmath106 ) than diagrams in which the quasiparticle lines cross .",
    "specifically , the effective mass is given by the equation :    [ ladder2 ] & = & - d d d^3 k d^3 q d_m^*(-- , - - ) + & & . where the impurity propagator on the right - hand side is to be computed using @xmath68 .",
    "the equations  , together define a self - consistent theory incorporating the effects of the impurity recoil and the quasiparticle rearrangement on each other . in this self - consistent approach",
    ", there are two ways for the impurity to emit a quasiparticle : either it can virtually occupy a shiba state and a continuum state , or it can virtually occupy two continuum states .",
    "( there can not be two shiba states at once as at least one of the quasiparticles must have the wrong spin to form a shiba state . )",
    "we first briefly consider processes in which an impurity creates a shiba state and a continuum state .",
    "it is straightforward to see that , even in the extreme limit where the zero - quasiparticle state hybridizes resonantly with such a state _ and _ the molecule is infinitely massive , this channel at most increases the effective mass by a factor of two .",
    "( this is the standard result for the hybridization between a dispersing band and a flat band . ) as we shall see , the continuum channel is parametrically more important at strong coupling .",
    "we now discuss the behavior of this continuum channel . from the discussion of the pair - creation diagram in the main text , we know that the dominant quasiparticle frequencies contributing to eq .",
    "are @xmath107 .",
    "therefore , we replace the t - matrix in this equation with its value at @xmath17 , i.e. , the bottom of the two - particle continuum ; this can be expressed in terms of an impurity - quasiparticle scattering length @xmath108  @xcite    t(k ) crucially , in the regime of interest ( i.e. , that of strong coupling , where a midgap shiba state is present ) , the scattering length is given by @xmath109 .",
    "thus , in terms of the bound state energy , the t - matrix element for pair creation is then given in the regime of interest by    t ( ) , where we have substituted in the anisotropic mass from the main text .",
    "we emphasize that this relation does _ not _ rely on the ladder approximation for the t - matrix . now",
    ", we evaluate eq .  , to arrive at the expression    = - t()^2 m^3/2 ( m^*)^1/2 - ( ) ^3/2 , where @xmath110 is a numerical constant of order unity .",
    "when @xmath89 is sufficiently large compared with the other scales , one finds that    m^ * m ( m v_f^2/(- e_b))^2/3 ~m ( ) ^2/3 for the theory to remain self - consistent , we require that @xmath111 ( otherwise it would not be legitimate to use the light - impurity limit for the t - matrix calculation ) .",
    "one can easily see that this self - consistency condition is satisfied whenever @xmath112 , i.e. , for relatively light impurities in the bcs limit .",
    "this self - consistent approach relies on the physically reasonable assumption that successive pair - creation events are uncorrelated . this assumption is also made by various intermediate - coupling theories such as ref .",
    "@xcite ; in contrast with such theories , however , we also include the `` vertex corrections '' ( i.e. , the t - matrix ladder diagrams ) that are necessary to account correctly for the existence of the bound state .",
    "these corrections are much more important here than in the standard polaron problem because the impurity - fermion interaction is _",
    "quadratic _ rather than linear in the fermions .",
    "we now consider the case of a one - dimensional system . in this case , the dispersion minimum consists of two points rather than a surface .",
    "the resulting qualitative differences are : ( i )  a midgap shiba molecule exists for arbitrarily weak coupling , and has a binding energy @xmath113 ; ( ii )  the perturbative effective - mass correction goes as @xmath114 , and _ decreases _ as the bare mass is increased [ in contrast with the three - dimensional result eqs .  , ] . in one dimension ,",
    "we can explicitly calculate ( using a self - consistent method described below ) the evolution of the bound - state energy and effective mass ; as shown in fig .  4 of the main text",
    ", the effective mass evolves smoothly across the parity - changing transition .",
    "we now introduce the self - consistent t - matrix procedure . in effect",
    ", this method treats @xmath1 exactly and involves resummed perturbation theory in @xmath115 , the inverse impurity mass .",
    "we begin by performing a standard , exact polaron transformation  @xcite on @xmath23 ; it then takes the form  = h _ + _ kk",
    "c^_k c_k + + ( p_0 - _ k k c^_k c_k ) ^2 in this equation , the first line is quadratic in the fermion operators , and corresponds to the solvable limit of a fixed ( @xmath116 ) impurity .",
    "the second line includes a term that is _ quartic _ in the fermions ; this quartic term renormalizes both the dispersion and the scattering of the fermions , via the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ diagrams ] . in general , the renormalized scattering will be @xmath99-dependent ; however , we note that @xmath4 is much larger than the other momentum scales involved , which justifies approximating the total fermion momentum as the difference between the number of right- and left - movers , i.e. ,      we are now equipped to write out a self - consistent set of equations for the fermion green s function and the t - matrix , shown diagrammatically in fig .",
    "[ diagrams ] .",
    "as we would like to discuss the even - sector effective mass even when the even sector is not the ground state , we shall work within the keldysh framework ; thus , all the green s functions in the procedure are the retarded component , except for the green s function in the loop , which is the keldysh component .",
    "( the keldysh component of the green s function is essentially a product of the spectral function and the distribution function ; we choose the distribution function to be the ground - state fermi function _ except _ that we require the shiba state to remain unfilled regardless of its energy . )    ; the red square , the interaction @xmath119 ; the thin lines are bare fermionic propagators ; the bold lines are full fermionic propagators ; and the other symbols are defined through the system of equations t1-t3 .",
    "t1 shows how the impurity - fermion interaction vertex is renormalized , to lowest order in @xmath115 , by impurity recoil .",
    "t2 accounts for repeated scattering events using this renormalized vertex by promoting it into a t - matrix , @xmath120 .",
    "t3 constructs the full green s function from the t - matrix via the standard relation  @xcite @xmath121 . ]    from these equations , it is straightforward to find the binding energy of the shiba state ( as one simply looks at the poles of the t - matrix in eq",
    ". t2 ) . in addition",
    ", one can extract the effective mass from this diagrammatic system , using the following exact relations :    = v = p / m^ * ; = p - _ k k c^_k c_k . physically , this equation states that the group velocity of the polaron ( viz .",
    "@xmath122 ) is on average the same as the velocity of the impurity , which is its momentum divided by its bare mass .",
    "once the impurity green s function is computed from diagram t3 in fig .",
    "[ diagrams ] , the expectation values on the right - hand side of this equation are known , and therefore it is straightforward to compute the effective mass .    figs .",
    "[ massdep ] show the typical dependence of the effective - mass correction on the bare mass and on @xmath1 .",
    "these results are remarkably close to those obtained via perturbation theory ( as in the main text ) :        in principle the self - consistent approach discussed here can be generalized directly to higher dimensions .",
    "for simplicity we consider the case of two dimensions .",
    "the key step is to replace eq .   with the substitution    _ c^ _ c _ k_f _ k ( ) c^_k c_k .",
    "one can then proceed as above , except that the renormalized interaction becomes a continuous function of @xmath123 instead of just acquiring a @xmath79 matrix structure .",
    "note that this approximation also cures the ultraviolet divergences that would arise if one tried to work with the full theory .",
    "we have not followed this route further in the present work because our analysis of the ( computationally simpler ) one - dimensional system suggests that the convergence of this approach is good only for @xmath124 , which is the opposite regime to that considered in the main text .",
    "however , we hope to adapt this approach to study the crossover between heavy and light impurities in future work ."

    "<S> the smallest eigenvalues of @xmath80 occur for @xmath81 ( the case discussed above ) when the recoil is large ; for a heavy impurity , however , the dispersion minimum moves to @xmath82 [ fig .  [ tmatrix](b ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> a similar crossover occurs in any dimension .    </S>",
    "<S> _ bec - bcs crossover_. the analysis above assumed @xmath83 ; this is valid in the bcs limit . </S>",
    "<S> however , our qualitative conclusions are based on the observation that the quasiparticle dispersion has a minimum at some nonzero momentum @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> this remains true in the unitary regime but with @xmath85 ; therefore , our main results ( in particular , the mexican - hat dispersion ) should extend to this regime if @xmath4 is replaced with @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> deep in the bec regime , the quasiparticle dispersion has a minimum at @xmath86 ; our results do not apply here .    </S>",
    "<S> _ experimental implementation_. the system discussed here can be realized in two - species atomic mixtures in which at least one species is fermionic . </S>",
    "<S> a promising realization involves li - cs mixtures  @xcite , in the magnetic - field range of 834 - 900 g. the li atoms form a bcs superfluid , while the cs - li interaction can be tuned through various heteronuclear feshbach resonances  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the impurity recoil @xmath87 , while @xmath88 0.01 - 0.1 @xmath89  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the molecular dispersion can be _ directly _ probed using momentum - resolved radio - frequency ( rf ) spectroscopy , as follows . </S>",
    "<S> suppose the impurity - fermion scattering length is negative for @xmath25 fermions and positive for @xmath26 fermions . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath25 fermions form a shiba state ; moreover , a feshbach molecule of the impurity and a @xmath26 fermion must exist . </S>",
    "<S> one can use an rf pulse to flip the spin state and drive transitions between the midgap shiba molecule and the feshbach molecule . because the rf pulse is momentum - conserving </S>",
    "<S> , one can map out the dispersion relation of the midgap shiba molecules by measuring the momentum of the feshbach molecules ( through time - of - flight imaging ) as a function of frequency  @xcite .    _ </S>",
    "<S> outlook_. we have argued that a moving magnetic impurity in a fermi superfluid can capture a quasiparticle and form an exotic midgap shiba molecule with a mexican - hat dispersion minimum ; as this dispersion minimum maps out the fermi surface , one can easily tune its shape by putting the fermions in an optical lattice . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the impurity statistics , the molecule can be bosonic or fermionic . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we expect the intermolecular exchange interactions to be exotic . </S>",
    "<S> qualitative aspects of these interactions can be deduced from recent work on pinned impurities  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> molecules interact by exchanging either continuum quasiparticles or shiba states . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , for a moving impurity the shiba - state exchange interaction is strongly _ angle - dependent _ because the molecular wavefunctions are anisotropic , as discussed above : molecules with center of mass momenta @xmath90 interact more strongly when @xmath91 than when @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> a quantitative treatment of these interactions will be given elsewhere . </S>",
    "<S> such interactions make midgap shiba molecules promising platforms to study the interplay between spherical dispersions and structured interactions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that a sufficiently high density of impurities might alter the character of the superfluid , favoring a modulated gap  @xcite . finally , while we discussed impurities in s - wave superfluids , even more unusual properties might be realizable with impurities in unconventional ( e.g. , topologically paired ) superfluids  @xcite .    </S>",
