    "the 2-dimensional gross - neveu model@xcite has often been used to examine theoretical issues of qcd .",
    "this stems from the fact that the model not only shares the property of asymptotic freedom and spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry with qcd , but also can be solved analytically in @xmath0 expansion . in this article",
    "we present a summary of an yet another study@xcite of this category .",
    "the problem addressed is how the phase diagram of the continuum theory at finite temperature and density@xcite emerges from that of the lattice theory formulated with the wilson fermion action .",
    "in particular we explore how this limit is achieved in the presence of the parity - broken phase due to the wilson action@xcite .",
    "an additional interest is to gain an understanding on how the tricritical point of the continuum model , separating a first- and second - order chiral transition on the @xmath1 plane , emerges from the lattice point of view .",
    "our lattice model is given by the lagrangian , @xmath2\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{a}{2}\\bar{\\psi}_n \\nabla_\\mu^2\\,\\psi_n\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is an @xmath4-component fermion field , and the chemical potential @xmath5 is introduced in the standard manner . in order to absorb the effect of the wilson term @xmath6 which breaks chiral symmetry , a mass counter term @xmath7 is introduced@xcite , and the two interaction terms are assigned an independent coupling constants @xmath8 and @xmath9@xcite .",
    "in the large @xmath4 limit , one can analytically calculate the effective potential @xmath10 as a function of @xmath11 and @xmath12 . making an expansion of the effective potential in terms of @xmath13",
    ", one finds that the continuum limit with chiral symmetry requires the following tuning relations of the coupling parameters@xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "therefore we have to study the lattice phase structure in the 3-dimensional space spanned by @xmath16 .",
    "we analyze the phase structure in terms of the effective potential @xmath17 and the saddle - point equations @xmath18 , @xmath19 calculated to leading order in @xmath0 .",
    "the latter equations exhibit both parity - broken solution @xmath20 and symmetric solution @xmath21 .",
    "one may expect that the phase boundary between the two solutions is determined by taking the limit @xmath22 from the parity - broken phase , in which case the transition would be of second order .",
    "the structure of the phase boundary is actually much more complex , some part of which turns out to be of first order after evaluation of the effective potential to locate the true minimum , as described below@xcite .",
    "the phase structure for @xmath23 and @xmath24 is schematically shown in fig .",
    "there are two regions separated by the boundary surfaces oabc and odec which join along the line oc . in the upper region , parity is spontaneously broken , while the system is parity - symmetric in the lower region .",
    "the parity - breaking phase transition along these surfaces is of second order except on the gray part ofc on which it is of first order .",
    "this gray part shrinks toward the continuum limit ( point o ) , hence has no effect on the continuum physics .",
    "the parity - symmetric phase in the lower region is divided into two phases by the hatched surface ocg which is vertical to the @xmath25 plane .",
    "the value of @xmath26 jumps from @xmath27 to @xmath28 across this surface , hence the transition is of first order .",
    "hereafter , we call it as @xmath26-boundary .    the continuum limit is taken along the curve specified by ( [ tune1])-([tune2 ] ) .",
    "if we take the leading term ( _ i.e. , _ ignore @xmath29 and @xmath30 terms ) , we obtain the the dashed curve in fig .",
    "1(a ) which runs just below the surface oabc . the @xmath31 ambiguity",
    ", however , allows us to shift the dashed curve to the right so that it runs below the surface odec . in either case ,",
    "physical quantities such as the value of @xmath26 converge to the continuum value . in particular , one can explicitly check that the first - order transition along the gray part does not cause problems in taking the continuum limit@xcite .      when we consider the system for a finite temporal lattice size , @xmath33 , corresponding to a finite temperature @xmath34 , the parity - breaking phase boundary shifts in the positive @xmath9 direction .",
    "at the same time the @xmath26-boundary recedes away from the point o so that a gap opens , as illustrated in fig .",
    "1(b ) .    when we approach the continuum limit along the curve with arrow , the form of the effective potential as a function of @xmath26 changes from a double well to a single well at the edge , hi , of the @xmath26-boundary .",
    "hence the value of @xmath26 drops to a small value as the line moves past the edge , signaling a restoration of chiral symmetry at finite temperature .",
    "we remind that the phase transition along the edge hi is of second order since it represents the termination point of a first - order transition along the @xmath26-boundary .",
    "thus the finite - temperature chiral phase transition is of second order in the continuum limit .      in fig .",
    "1(c ) we show the phase structure at @xmath35 with @xmath23 .",
    "the effect of finite chemical potential is to create a new phase in the parity - symmetric region in between those of @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the new phase is characterized by a small value @xmath36 , therefore chiral symmetry is effectively restored in it .",
    "the two phase boundaries jkqp and lmqp are both of first order . hence , when the curve with arrow defining the continuum limit penetrates the boundary surface , as illustrated in fig .",
    "1(c ) , chiral symmetry becomes restored through a first - order phase transition .",
    "the phase diagram and order of chiral phase transition for general values of temperature and chemical potential are determined by a combination of the finite - temperature and finite - density effects discussed above . at relatively low temperatures , the situation as",
    "a function of @xmath5 is similar to that at @xmath23 .",
    "hence a first - order chiral transition occurs . on the other hand , at high temperatures ,",
    "the behavior of phase structure is the same type as that at @xmath24 , leading to a second - order phase transition .",
    "let us define a @xmath39-parameter by @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) with which @xmath42 at @xmath43 in the continuum limit .",
    "in fig .  2 and fig .  3 , we plot @xmath44 as a function of @xmath45 for a set of values of @xmath33 at @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "we observe a clear first - order transition for the low - temperature case ( fig .",
    "2 ) , which changes to a second - order transition at high temperatures ( fig .  3 ) . furthermore",
    ", the curves for finite @xmath33 converge to the continuum result ( thick solid line ) at @xmath48 .",
    "these results show how the lattice phase structure leads to the phase diagram of the continuum theory with a tricritical point@xcite .",
    "the phase structure of qcd in the @xmath49 plane is still largely unknown , and various interesting possibilities have recently been discussed@xcite .",
    "lattice study of these possibilities with the wilson quark action has to disentangle effects of parity - broken phase from physical ones .",
    "our results should be helpful in the effort in this direction ."
