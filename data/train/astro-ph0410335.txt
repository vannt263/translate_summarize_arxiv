    "interstellar glycine ( nh@xmath0ch@xmath0cooh ) has been unsuccessfully sought using both single - element telescopes ( brown et al . 1979 ; hollis et al . 1980 ; snyder et al .",
    "1983 ; beralis et al . 1985 ; guelin & cernicharo 1989 ; combes , rieu , & wlodarczak 1996 ; ceccarelli et al . 2000 ) and interferometric arrays ( snyder 1997 ; hollis et al . 2003a , b ) .",
    "recently , kuan et al . ( 2003 ) reported the identification of interstellar glycine ( nh@xmath0ch@xmath0cooh ) in the direction of the hot molecular cores sgr b2(n - lmh ) , orion kl , and w51 e1/e2 .",
    "we note several unusual aspects about the kuan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) reported glycine results .",
    "first , their glycine report was based on the detection of 27 spectral line features in the sources orion  kl , w51 e1/e2 , and sgr  b2(n - lmh ) .",
    "they used the nrao 12  m radio telescope operating in the range of 130 to 242 ghz .",
    "the 27 independent spectral line features detected in 3 different sources might seem to suggest reasonable evidence .",
    "certainly the detection of the same ensemble of spectral lines in multiple sources is a characteristic of interstellar molecules with structural components similar to glycine , such as formic acid ( hcooh ) and acetic acid ( ch@xmath1cooh)(see , for example , liu , mehringer , & snyder 2001 ; remijan et al .",
    "however , each of the three glycine sources was observed to contain no more than 13 to 16 of the 27 independent spectral lines features and only 3 of the 27 spectral line features were found to be common to all 3 sources .",
    "second , 16 of the 27 reported glycine features are not the four - fold degenerate rotational transitions that should be the most likely to be detected for r - branch asymmetric rotor transitions .",
    "third , the glycine rest frequencies used in their observations were based on a hamiltonian calculation which was extrapolated over 100 ghz .",
    "this method can yield potentially large uncertainties in the frequency predictions .",
    "fourth , the glycine column densities derived from rotational temperature diagrams were surprisingly high .",
    "in fact , orion kl was reported to have the highest glycine column density , but the interstellar molecule with structure closest to glycine , acetic acid , has never been detected there ( remijan et al . 2003 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the above concerns by starting from new laboratory measurements of glycine that improve the hamiltonian fit and thereby result in highly reliable interpolated frequency predictions which provide the foundation for our discussion .",
    "we list and explain rigorous and essential criteria for identifying a new interstellar molecule such as glycine .",
    "then we use these criteria on key glycine spectral lines reported by kuan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) to interpret independent observational data for orion kl , w51 e1/e2 , and sgr  b2(n - lmh ) , and show that their key lines fail the tests required for a correct glycine identification . in investigating alternative identifications ,",
    "we find that the carriers of several important spectral lines which have been assigned to glycine are more logically assigned to other , more common species .",
    "finally , we find that random choices of unidentified spectral lines can be used to generate a reasonable glycine rotational temperature diagram similar to those published by kuan et al .",
    "the microwave spectrum of conformer i of glycine was first recorded by suenram & lovas ( 1980 ) from 82 ghz to 113 ghz in a heated parallel plate stark cell .",
    "this study provided the rotational analysis and rough dipole moment determination .",
    "further measurements of the @xmath2n quadrupole coupling hyperfine structure and stark effect on low j transitions between 16 ghz and 24.5 ghz were subsequently reported by lovas et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . while these literature data provided a firm basis for predicting transitions up to about 150 ghz for guiding past interstellar searches , the 2 @xmath3 ( standard deviation ) uncertainties ranged from 1.5 mhz at 206 ghz to 2.8 mhz at 240 ghz for the main interstellar transitions reported by kuan et al .",
    "recently , at kharkow a heated quartz absorption cell was used to provide new measurements between 75 ghz and 260 ghz utilizing an automated synthesizer - based spectrometer described by ilyushin et al .",
    "new glycine search frequencies could then be predicted by incorporating both the previously reported transitions and the new measurements into a rotational analysis which employed the watson a - reduction hamiltonian with quartic centrifugal distortion terms included ( watson 1977 ) .",
    "the details of these laboratory measurements and hamiltonian calculations will be reported in a future paper . for this paper , it is important to note that for the majority of the calculated transitions the uncertainties have been reduced by a factor of 10 or more from those used by kuan et al .",
    "thus , we are starting our analysis with highly accurate glycine rest frequency predictions .",
    "table 1 summarizes the reported glycine line detections in the direction of the hot molecular cores sgr b2(n - lmh ) , orion kl , and w51 e1/e2 .",
    "the first column lists a number that kuan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) introduced to represent a particular glycine line . for the convenience of the reader",
    ", we adopt this shorthand notation hereafter referred to as the `` glycine line number '' .",
    "the second column gives the rotational quantum numbers of the associated transitions , and the third identifies each reported transition as an a - type or a b - type .",
    "the fourth column lists our newly calculated glycine rest frequencies , and the fifth and sixth columns give the associated line strengths and upper energy levels .",
    "the final six columns in table 1 list the observed lsr velocity and brightness temperature of each glycine line reported for each source .",
    "we have listed in boldface the lsr velocity and brightness temperature values for the lines that were displayed by kuan et al .",
    "the task of establishing the identification of a new interstellar molecule in a dense interstellar cloud is made more complicated by high spectral line densities .",
    "for example , at 3 mm wavelength sgr b2(n - lmh ) has a spectral line density of 6.06 lines per 100 mhz , half of which are unidentified ( friedel et al .",
    "this is the highest reported line density in radio astronomy .",
    "hence , the detection of spectral lines with frequencies close to a new species is not in itself sufficient evidence for a correct assignment .",
    "consequently , there are several criteria to consider in securing the correct identification of a new interstellar molecule such as glycine .    _ rest frequencies _ :",
    "the most important criterion for establishing the identification of a new interstellar molecule is that the rest frequencies must be established to a high degree of accuracy .",
    "preferably , the spectral line astronomical rest frequencies to be used in the interstellar search should have been directly measured in the laboratory .",
    "if such direct measurements are not available , interpolation fitting of the available laboratory data from other frequencies should allow construction of a high precision hamiltonian model which can be used to predict search frequencies with uncertainties on the order of 1 part in 10 million .",
    "_ frequency agreement _ : there must be frequency agreement among all detected transitions .",
    "this means that an accurate astronomical rest frequency of the assigned transition must be in reasonable agreement with the frequency corresponding to the lsr velocity of the source .",
    "variations in the lsr velocity of a given molecular species can occur when regions with different kinematics contribute to the emission or absorption spectrum .",
    "however , it is evident that emission lines from a given molecular species which emanate from a region with no large kinematic variance will have a well - defined velocity field .",
    "examples are the vla measurements of the kinematics of methyl formate ( hcooch@xmath4 ) toward omc-1 by hollis et al .",
    "( 2003a ) and ethyl cyanide ( ch@xmath4ch@xmath0cn ) toward sgr b2(n - lmh ) by hollis et al .",
    "( 2003b ) .",
    "if there is a source velocity gradient , as established from observed transitions of known molecules , it can not be a random function of transition frequency or energy level .",
    "furthermore , it is not uncommon to have an interstellar spectral line from one species blend with another line of either the same or another species . in order to correctly assign or confirm a line identification",
    ", a common standard is that the lines should be at least resolved by the rayleigh criterion .",
    "that is , the minimum distance between two spectral lines in frequency space must be such that the maximum intensity of one line falls on the first null of the other ( see , for example , jenkins & white 1957 ; sommerfeld 1964 ) .",
    "this is approximately equivalent to requiring that overlapping lines be separated by their full line width at half maximum intensity ( assuming identical line profiles ) . in practice , a more stringent criterion based on the signal - to - noise ratio",
    "is often needed whereby two overlapping lines can be considered resolved if they are at least separated at half - maximum intensity of the weakest line .    _",
    "beam dilution _",
    ": suppose one uses a single - element radio telescope with circular aperture of diameter d ( such as the nrao 12 m ) to observe separate transitions of some molecule at 50 ghz , 100 ghz , and 150 ghz .",
    "the full half - power beam width ( hpbw ) of the telescope is approximately given by 1.22  @xmath5/d rad ( born & wolf 1980 ; see also rohlfs & wilson 2000 ) , so in this case the telescope hpbw changes by a factor of 3 over the range of observations .",
    "as we will discuss , beam dilution scales with source size squared and beam size squared . to examine the required correction for beam dilution",
    ", we can start with @xmath6 , the beam - averaged molecular column density determined from the integrated intensity of a rotation transition observed by a single - element radio telescope . in autocorrelation mode , with the assumptions of lte and low optical depth ( see , for example , snyder et al .",
    "2001 ; dickens et al .",
    "1997 ) , @xmath6 is given by    @xmath7    in equation ( 1 ) , @xmath8 in k km s@xmath9 , where t@xmath10 is the radiation temperature of the source and @xmath11 is the fwhm line width .",
    "t@xmath10 is related to the measured antenna temperature @xmath12 ( corrected for atmospheric attenuation , rear spillover , blockage , ohmic losses , and forward spillover ) by t@xmath10 = @xmath12/@xmath13 , where @xmath13 is the source - beam coupling efficiency ( kutner & ulich 1981 ) .",
    "other terms in equation ( 1 ) are @xmath14 , the rotational partition function , e@xmath15 , the upper rotational energy level , t@xmath16 , the rotational temperature , s , the line strength , @xmath17 , the square of the dipole moment in debye@xmath18 , and @xmath19 , the frequency in ghz . if the source is comparable to or smaller than the main beam , @xmath13 = @xmath20  b , where @xmath20 is the corrected main beam efficiency and is the fraction of power in the main beam relative to the power in the main beam plus error beam ( jewell 1990 ) .",
    "b is the geometric coupling efficiency between the main beam and the source , and is often called the beam filling factor .",
    "note that @xmath20 is related to the phase errors of the reflector surface and is thus a function of frequency .",
    "for example , for the nrao 12 m , @xmath20 = 0.83 at 113 ghz and 0.45 at 240 ghz .",
    "the above formalism is applicable to sources with angular extent smaller than or on the order of the main beam .",
    "highly extended sources may couple with some or all of the error beam and require a different source - beam convolution .    for a circular gaussian telescope beam size @xmath21 centered on the peak of a circular gaussian source of size @xmath22 ,",
    "the resulting convolution yields a beam filling factor b given by ( e.g. , see equation ( 28 ) of ulich & haas 1976 )    @xmath23    if @xmath22 @xmath24 @xmath21 , b @xmath25 1 . when @xmath22",
    "@xmath25 @xmath21 , b @xmath25 0.5 , but if @xmath22 @xmath26 @xmath21 , b @xmath25 @xmath27 .",
    "_ relative intensities _ :",
    "once several molecular transition assignments have been made , their relative intensities must be tested for consistency . for a source comparable to or smaller in angular size than the main beam of the telescope ,",
    "the relative intensity of two single lines is determined by the corrected beam efficiencies , beam filling factors , dipole moments , line strengths , frequencies , energy levels , and rotational temperature according to equation ( 1 ) as    @xmath28    conformer i glycine has an a - type dipole moment , @xmath29 = 0.911(6 ) d ( 3.039(20 ) x 10@xmath30 c m ) , and a b - type , @xmath31 = 0.697(10 ) d ( 2.325(34 ) x 10@xmath30 c m ) ( lovas et al . 1995 ) .",
    "therefore , for a given frequency , the product s@xmath32@xmath18 dictates that a - type transitions are stronger than b - type when s values are comparable .",
    "a typical property of prolate asymmetric rotors such as glycine is that two low k@xmath33 a - type and two b - type transitions become degenerate as the transition frequencies increase . in this four - fold degeneracy ,",
    "all four transitions have the same rest frequency and energy levels , but different line strengths for the a - type and the b - type .",
    "this effect begins at @xmath25 107 ghz for glycine and it is important because the lines with this degeneracy are the most likely to be detected .",
    "the total intensity of a four - fold degenerate line at frequency @xmath34 is given by the sum of the four individual unresolved components , @xmath35 , and the ratio of the _ ith _ degenerate line to the _ jth _ degenerate line is given by equation ( 1 ) as    @xmath36    similar expressions can be derived for comparing the intensity of a single glycine line to either a two - fold or a four - fold degenerate glycine line .",
    "_ confirming transitions _ : once a candidate line is assigned , the assumption of optical thinness under lte conditions allows predictions of intensities of additional confirming transitions unless line self - absorption , maser activity , or some other mitigating effect is evident .",
    "hence , a key test of the correctness of the assignment of a transition is that any other transitions connected by favorable transition probabilities must also be present if the relative intensity predictions lead to detectable signal levels .",
    "the maximum line strength for a - type asymmetric rotor r - branch transitions of a molecule like glycine occurs when s approaches j@xmath37 , the upper level value of j. for a - type transitions , this means that the strongest transitions in a series will be those for which j@xmath37@xmath38 - j@xmath39 = j@xmath37@xmath40 - j@xmath37 - 1@xmath41 or j@xmath37@xmath42 - j@xmath37 - 1@xmath43 .",
    "the next strongest in this series will be j@xmath37@xmath44 - j@xmath37 - 1@xmath45 or j@xmath37@xmath46 - j@xmath37 - 1@xmath47 . for b - type transitions ,",
    "the maximum line strength occurs when s approaches j@xmath37 - 1 . here",
    "the strongest transitions will be those for which j@xmath37@xmath48 - j@xmath37 - 1@xmath43 or j@xmath37@xmath42 - j@xmath37 - 1@xmath49 .",
    "the next strongest will be j@xmath37@xmath43 - j@xmath37 - 1@xmath47 or j@xmath37@xmath46 -j@xmath37 - 1@xmath50 .",
    "note that a - type transitions follow radiative selection rules where the parity change of the quantum numbers k@xmath33,k@xmath51 in a transition is e , e @xmath52 e , o ( even , even @xmath52 even , odd ) or o , o @xmath52 o , e while the b - type transitions obey e , e @xmath52 o , o or e , o @xmath52 o , e ( see , for example , townes & schawlow 1975 ) .",
    "kuan et al . ( 2003 ) state that their 27 glycine lines ( table 1 ) are detected in one or more hot molecular cores ( hmcs ) .",
    "we note that hmcs are compact objects where interferometric measurements have shown that structurally similar but simpler large molecules are concentrated with diameters @xmath53 10@xmath54 .",
    "for example , the hmc of one of their sources , sgr  b2(n - lmh ) , is @xmath25 4@xmath54 as measured in ethyl cyanide ( ch@xmath4ch@xmath0cn ) and vinyl cyanide ( ch@xmath0chcn ) by liu & snyder ( 1999 ) . on the other hand , kuan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) assume that their hmc glycine lines are optically thin and in lte and do not correct for beam dilution in their rotational temperature diagrams- a tacit assumption that their glycine sources are extended enough to at least fill their beam . in the case of orion kl",
    ", they speculated that the glycine emission is extended because the rotational temperature diagram has a `` tight fit '' and , in addition , perhaps the emission is not perfectly centered at the nominal compact ridge position .",
    "they used this scenario to reject the orion glycine negative results found by combes et al .",
    "( 1996 ) with the iram 30  m telescope because the narrower 30  m beam might have missed a significant portion of the glycine emission observed by the wider nrao  12  m beam .",
    "we note that equation ( 1 ) of kuan et al.(2003 ) is basically the same as equation ( 23 ) of goldsmith & langer ( 1999 ) if the gas is assumed to be optically thin in lte .",
    "the resulting column density is called a beam - averaged total column density . however , equation ( 38 ) of goldsmith & langer ( 1999 ) shows that equation ( 1 ) actually is based on the further assumption that each glycine source fills the beam at each of the reported glycine frequencies .",
    "otherwise , the derived glycine beam - averaged total column densities and rotational excitation temperatures have little physical meaning ; they just become numerical parameters of a least - squares fit with little predictive value .",
    "how can the condition that the reported glycine sources fill each beam be satisfied ?",
    "kuan et al . ( 2003 ) state that their half - power beamwidths are @xmath25 30@xmath54 , 45@xmath54 , and 60@xmath54 at 1.3 , 2 , and 3 mm , respectively .",
    "table 1 of kuan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) lists the 2 mm lines ( starting with glycine line 1 ) as the lowest frequency glycine lines that they claim .",
    "thus these lines would determine the smallest extent ( @xmath25 45 \" ) that the reported glycine could have in equation ( 1 ) of kuan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) without suffering from beam dilution .",
    "consequently , in our analysis we used 45@xmath54 as our upper limit for our trial source size .    in the following",
    ", we will apply the criteria from  3 to examine available observational data for the possibility that the spectral lines assigned to glycine have been misidentified . in order to address the ambiguities introduced by the glycine source sizes , we will assume two cases : ( 1 ) the glycine emission sources are hmcs with core diameters typically @xmath53 10@xmath54 ; or ( 2 ) glycine fills the beam of the 12  m telescope and hence is extended over at least 45@xmath54 in each source . for our analysis",

    "for example , deep searches for acetone have only been conducted in sgr  b2(n ) ( snyder et al . 2002 ) , but acetone may well be detectable in orion kl and w51 e1/e2 at the levels cited by kuan et al .",
    "certainly most of the good alternative candidates for lines reported as glycine are more likely to be detectable than glycine , and the identification of these candidates can be checked by further observational work on other favorable transitions .",
    "in a given spectral range for a given source , it is our intention to demonstrate that one can use random u line data that are nearly frequency coincident with glycine transitions to obtain a reasonable looking rotational diagram .",
    "the results of the rotation diagram are then used to show that the most likely glycine transitions ( particularly a - type with large transition strengths ) are either severely lacking in predicted intensity or altogether missing in the given spectral range .",
    "kuan et al . ( 2003 ) used rotation temperature diagrams constructed from sgr b2(n - lmh ) , orion kl , and w51 e1/e2 data to bolster their arguments for the identification of glycine . in appendix",
    "a , we have noted that rotational temperature diagrams can not be used as independent tools to verify interstellar spectral line identifications because the frequency parameter in equation a4 or a5 will dominate the integrated intensity , line strength , and dipole moment terms for typical spectral line data in the millimeter or submillimeter range . in the following discussion",
    ", we illustrate this important point . as a data base",
    ", we used the 123 unidentified ( u ) lines detected in a millimeter wavelength spectral line survey conducted by friedel et al .",
    "( 2004 ) toward sgr  b2(n - lmh ) with the bima array .",
    "we searched this u line data base for near frequency - coincident transitions of glycine with the following criteria for matching lines :    1 .",
    "the 2@xmath3 frequency uncertainty of each calculated glycine transition had to be less than 2.82 mhz ( equivalent to twice the largest 1@xmath3 uncertainty from kuan et al .",
    "this uncertainty turned out to be less than 1.84 mhz .",
    "2 .   friedel et al .  (",
    "2004 ) established the rest frequency of each u line by assuming a v@xmath114 of 64 km s@xmath9 . kuan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) states that an acceptable velocity range for sgr  b2(n - lmh ) is between 58 and 75 km s@xmath9 . therefore , we allowed a tolerance in our u line frequencies which corresponded to a v@xmath114 of 64@xmath115 km s@xmath9 with an additional uncertainty of @xmath77 390 khz due to the spectral resolution used by friedel et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for the u line observations . 3 .",
    "the width of each matched u line had to be between 2.8 and 12.7 km s@xmath9 , which is the spread in line widths from the data in kuan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) toward sgr  b2(n ) .",
    "there were 2 exceptions , but the uncertainties easily reached into this range .",
    "we selected only u lines whose intensity was not too great for the associated transition . if the u line appeared to be a blend of transitions from several species , it was not used .",
    "table 6 lists the glycine and u line frequencies that will be used in our rotational temperature diagram discussion .",
    "the first two columns list calculated glycine rest frequencies and corresponding transitions .",
    "the third and fourth columns list the product of the line strength and dipole moment squared ( @xmath116 ) and upper energy ( @xmath117 ) for each glycine transition .",
    "the fifth column lists u lines which were selected using criteria listed above .",
    "the sixth and seventh columns list the u line integrated intensity derived from friedel et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and synthesized beam size employed in the observations .",
    "table 6 shows that the frequencies of 11 u lines ( col .",
    "5 ) nearly match frequencies of 12 degenerate and non - degenerate glycine transitions ( col .  1 ) .",
    "under the assumption of no beam dilution , the glycine rotational temperature diagram in figure 6 was constructed using calculated glycine frequencies in equation a4 .",
    "the figure 6 data points were fit with a straight line by a least squares method that weights each integrated intensity by its uncertainty which generally results in smaller uncertainties in slope and intercept when compared to an unweighted least squares fit ( bevington & robinson 1992 ) .",
    "the resulting weighted fit produced a rotational temperature of 90(13 ) k and a total column density , @xmath6 , of 1.1(1)@xmath6910@xmath118 @xmath66 .",
    "the derived rotational temperature and column density is similar to those of other molecules detected toward sgrb2(n - lmh ) at high spatial resolution .",
    "if figure 6 is a valid glycine rotational diagram , then the derived rotational temperature and column density parameters can be used to predict other likely ( i.e. , large s@xmath17 ) glycine lines in the frequency range of the friedel et al .",
    "( 2004 ) survey .",
    "five such glycine transitions were contained within the survey , but none was detected .",
    "the 1 @xmath3 integrated intensity upper limits are given in column 6 of table 6 .",
    "the integrated intensity upper limits are the product of the rms noise level in units of jy beam@xmath9 and an assumed linewidth of 12.7 km s@xmath9 ( the largest linewidth reported by kuan et al .",
    "predictions for the minimum expected intensity of these 5 lines are included in footnotes to col .  6 and range from 9 to 18 @xmath3 .",
    "these missing lines demonstrate that the figure 6 rotational diagram purported to be glycine is based on incorrectly identified and misassigned lines .",
    "we have produced a rotational temperature diagram that looks reasonable and gives reasonable results for unidentified lines assumed to be glycine , but we have also demonstrated that these rotational temperature diagram results have no power to predict the intensities of other likely glycine lines . we conclude that this particular rotational diagram is the result of misassigned u lines and can not be used as reliable independent evidence to support the interstellar molecular identification of glycine .",
    "we note that equation a4 or a5 will be dominated by the frequency parameter and , as a result , one can almost always construct a reasonable looking rotational temperature diagram from any forest of weak lines spread across a large enough range in energy of a complicated asymmetric rotor molecule like glycine .",
    "as we discussed in  1 , there are several pecularities if the lines reported by kuan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) in sgr b2 ( n - lmh ) , orion kl , and w51el / e2 belong to interstellar glycine .",
    "therefore , we examined their assignments of key glycine transitions to the spectral lines listed in table 1 .",
    "we noted that their lack of correction for beam dilution amounted to the tacit assumption that their glycine sources have an extended source size with @xmath22 @xmath71 45@xmath54 . in orion kl , we found that none of the 15 glycine line assignments could be verified because the reported intensities of all 15 lines predict that a major glycine quartet ( j=19 - 18 , k@xmath33 = 0 or 1 ) should have been detected in our orion data from the nrao 12  m telescope ( figures 1 and 2 ) .",
    "so we can conclude that the orion spectral lines reported by kuan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ( column 8 , table 1 ) are not glycine .",
    "previously , the vla data of hollis et al .",
    "( 2003b ) established upper limits in orion for compact glycine sources .",
    "therefore , glycine has not been verified in either extended or in compact sources in orion . in w51 el",
    "/ e2 , 16 lines were assigned to glycine .",
    "fifteen of the 16 line intensities lend to the predictions that the j=19 - 18 , k@xmath33 = 0 or 1 glycine quartets should have been detected in our w51 data from the nrao 12  m telescope ( figures 3 and 4 ) .",
    "since our spectra show a negative result , we can conclude that the reported w51 spectral lines are also not glycine ( column 9 , table 1 ) . in the direction of sgr   b2(n - lmh ) , only 13 lines were assigned to glycine but the situation is slightly more complicated by the high spectral line density .",
    "however , it can be simplified by recognizing that , based on both line strength values and intensity calculations , the two strongest glycine lines should be those assigned to lines 26 and 27 in column 7 of table 1 .",
    "line 26 appears with a peak intensity of 300  mk in the sgr  b2(n ) band scan data of nummelin et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , but the important connected lines , j=42 - 41 and 41 - 40 in the k@xmath33 = l or 2 series , are missing altogether ( table 3 ) .",
    "furthermore , line 27 should be stronger than line 26 , but it too is missing , along with the connected j=43 - 42 and 42 - 41 lines in the k@xmath33 = 0 or 1 series ( table 4 ) .",
    "all of these key glycine lines strongly connect major k@xmath33 = 0 , 1 , or 2 rotational levels , so their absence is not possible if the other sgr b2(n - lmh ) glycine lines are assigned correctly .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the sgr b2(n - lmh ) spectral lines reported by kuan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ( column 7 , table 1 ) are not glycine .",
    "in addition , the vla data of hollis et al .",
    "( 2003a ) established upper limits for compact glycine sources in sgr b2(n - lm ) .",
    "consequently , glycine has not been verified in sgr b2(n - lmh ) either in extended or in compact sources .    if the 27 lines reported by kuan et al . ( 2003 ) in orion kl , w51el / e2 , and sgr  b2(n - lmh ) are not glycine , what are they ?",
    "lines 21 , 24 , and 26 in table 1 are the 3 lines reported to be common to all 3 sources . we have argued that vibrationally excited ethyl cyanide ( ch@xmath4ch@xmath0cn ) is a logical assignment for line 21 , and vibrationally excited vinyl cyanide ( ch@xmath0chcn ) for line 24 .",
    "the intensity of line 26 increases as the observational beam width narrows , so it could also be a constituent of a somewhat compact source .",
    "four other reported glycine lines could be possibly assigned to more common species listed in table 5 . beyond this , it is difficult to comment on other possible line carrier candidates because kuan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) only published sample spectra for 11 of their 27 lines .",
    "finally , we have demonstrated that rotational temperature diagrams can not by themselves be used to identify interstellar molecules .",
    "we are indebted to a. nummelin for providing data from sgr  b2(n ) .",
    "we thank e. b. churchwell , e. c. sutton , and w. d. watson for helpful assistance .",
    "we appreciate the useful comments from two referees .",

    "we acknowledge support from the laboratory for astronomical imaging at the university of illinois , and nsf grants ast 99 - 81363 and ast 02 - 28953 .",
    "the laboratory measurements of the glycine spectrum were supported by stcu under contract no .",
    "2132 .",
    "the conventional method for forming a rotational temperature diagram is to plot the logarithm of normalized column density vs. upper state rotational energy level .",
    "however , this approach incorporates several assumptions .",
    "first , it is assumed that each region in the interstellar cloud has uniform physical conditions and that the populations of the energy levels can be characterized by a boltzmann distribution .",
    "second , optically thin conditions are assumed but it may be possible to correct for this assumption later in the analysis .",
    "third , if it is not possible to measure the source size , it must be assumed the source fills the observational beam .",
    "so , if the population distribution can be described adequately by a single rotational temperature and if all the lines are optically thin , the measured fluxes are proportional to the column densities in the upper levels of the transitions being observed .    for autocorrelation ( single - element telescope ) observations",
    ", we can start with equation ( 1 ) in  3 . for cross - correlation ( interferometric array ) observations , we can use ( see , for example , snyder et al .",
    "2001 )      in equation ( a1 ) , @xmath120 in jy beam@xmath9 km s@xmath9 , and @xmath121 is the flux density per beam .",
    "@xmath14 is the rotational partition function , b is the beam filling factor , @xmath122 and @xmath123 are the fwhm synthesized beam dimensions in arcsec , s is the linestrength , @xmath17 the square of the dipole moment in debye@xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the frequency in ghz .",
    "the beam - averaged upper level column density , @xmath124 , is defined by              a linear least - squares fit to equation ( a4 ) can be used to construct a rotational temperature diagram where the slope gives the negative reciprocal of the rotational temperature .",
    "this temperature can be used to estimate the total molecular column density @xmath6 .",
    "the rotational temperature will be equal to the kinetic temperature only at sufficiently high densities .",
    "a similar approach can be followed with equations ( 1 ) and ( a2 ) to construct a rotational temperature diagram from autocorrelation ( single - element telescope ) data :          this approach slightly complicates the rotational temperature term .",
    "however , it makes the data scatter appear to be smaller since @xmath131 = 0.434 @xmath132 .",
    "the second important caveat is in either equations ( a4 ) or equation ( a5 ) , the frequency parameter will dominate the integrated intensity , line strength , and dipole moment terms for typical spectral line data in the millimeter or submillimeter range .",
    "hence , rotational temperature diagrams can not be used as independent tools to verify interstellar spectral line identifications .",
    "this point is illustrated in  5 .",
    "if the emission is not optically thin , the finite opacity produces an underestimate in the upper level column density of the observed transition and it can also produce an error in the rotational temperature .",
    "based on the discussion presented by goldsmith & langer ( 1999 ) , the optical depth , @xmath133 , can be used to define an optical depth correction factor , @xmath134 , where          since @xmath137 , it has been described by goldsmith & langer ( 1999 ) as the factor by which @xmath138 ( derived directly from @xmath139 ) can appear to be too small because of a finite optical depth .",
    "note that @xmath134 can be different for each independent transition because @xmath133 is proportional to @xmath116 . for finite optical depths",
    ", we find    @xmath140 which is analogous to equation ( 24 ) of goldsmith & langer ( 1999 ) .",
    "clearly , @xmath141 lowers the ordinate intensity from the optically thin value for each point on the rotational intensity diagram .",
    "we ca nt calculate a realistic value of @xmath141 for glycine as no interstellar glycine line identification has been confirmed .",
    "however , goldsmith & langer ( 1999 ) modeled @xmath133 values for methanol ( an esablished interstellar asymmetric rotor ) that ranged from 0.25 to 30 . if @xmath142 for a given glycine line , that point on the rotational temperature diagram would be depressed by 3.4 , a significant amount . on the other hand",
