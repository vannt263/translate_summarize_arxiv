    "1e 1743.1 - 2843 is one of the most absorbed ( @xmath0 ) x - ray sources of the galactic centre ( gc ) region , suggesting a distance close or even greater than the gc . in the last years",
    "the source has been observed by numerous x - ray telescopes up to 20 kev , but it has never been detected in the hard x - rays , because of the lack of combined high spatial resolution and good sensitivity instruments at high energies .",
    "_ bepposax _ has long observed the galactic centre region , but it has never detected any bursting activity ( int zand 2000 ) , nor periodic pulsation from this source ( cremonesi et al .",
    "also _ xmm - newton _ observations reported by porquet et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , limited to the range below 10 kev , did not solved the mystery of the source nature ; they underlined that high energy observations could help in the determination of the compact object nature .",

    "i x - ray bursts become rare going up a few percent of eddington luminosity ( lewin et al .",

    "the source distance can not be less than 20 kpc .",
    "considering that nearly all lmxrbs with persistent x - ray emission contain a ns ( van der klis 2004 ) and the strong variability usually associated to bh binary systems , this assumption seems to be less strong than the ns one .",
