    "general relativity ( henceforth ` gr ' ) differs markedly in many structural aspects from all other theories of fundamental interactions , which are all formulated as poincar invariant theories in the framework of special relativity ( henceforth ` sr ' ) .",
    "the characterisation of this difference has been a central theme not only for physicists , but also for philosophers and historians of science .",
    "einstein himself emphasised in later ( 1933 ) recollections the importance of his failure to formulate a viable special - relativistic theory of gravity for the understanding of the genesis of gr .",
    "any attempt to give such a characterisation should clearly include a precise description of the constraints that prevent gravity from also fitting into the framework of sr .",
    "in modern terminology , a natural way to proceed would be to consider fields according to mass and spin , discuss their possible equations , the inner consistency of the mathematical schemes so obtained , and finally their experimental consequences .",
    "since gravity is a classical , macroscopically observable , and long - ranged field , one usually assumes right at the beginning the spin to be integral and the mass parameter to be zero .",
    "the first thing to consider would therefore be a massless scalar field .",
    "what goes wrong with such a theory ?",
    "when one investigates this question , anticipating that something does indeed go wrong , one should clearly distinguish between the following two types of reasonings :    * the theory is internally inconsistent . in a trivial sense",
    "this may mean that it is mathematically contradictory , in which case this is the end of the story . on a more sophisticated level",
    "it might also mean that the theory violates accepted fundamental physical principles , like , e.g. , that of energy conservation , without being plainly mathematically contradictory .",
    "* the theory is formally consistent and in accord with basic physical principles .",
    "however , it is refuted by experiments .",
    "note that , generically , it does not make much sense to claim both shortcomings simultaneously , since ` predictions ' of inconsistent theories should not be trusted .",
    "the question to be addressed here is whether special - relativistic theories of scalar gravity fall under the first category , i.e. whether they can be refuted on the basis of formal arguments alone without reference to specific experiments .",
    "many people think that it can , following a.einstein who accused scalar theories to    * violate some form of the principle of universality of free fall , * violate energy conservation .    the purpose of this paper is to investigate these statements in detail .",
    "we will proceed by the standard ( lagrangian ) methods of modern field theory and take what we perceive as the obvious route when working from first principles .",
    "as already stressed , the abandonment of scalar theories of gravity by einstein is intimately linked with the birth of gr , in particular with his conviction that general covariance must replace the principle of relativity as used in sr .",
    "i will focus on two historical sources in which einstein complains about scalar gravity not being adequate .",
    "one is his joint paper with marcel grossman on the so - called ` entwurf theory ' ( @xcite , vol.4 , doc.13 , henceforth called the ` entwurf paper ' ) , of which grossmann wrote the `` mathematical part '' and einstein the `` physical part '' .",
    "einstein finished with  7 , whose title asks : `` can the gravitational field be reduced to a scalar?''(german original : `` kann das gravitationsfeld auf einen skalar zurckgefhrt werden ? '' ) . in this paragraph",
    "he presented a gedankenexperiment - based argument which allegedly shows that any special - relativistic scalar theory of gravity , in which the gravitational field couples exclusively to the matter via the trace of its energy - momentum tensor , necessarily violates energy conservation and is hence physically inconsistent .",
    "this he presented as plausibility argument why gravity has to be described by a more complex quantity , like the @xmath0 of the entwurf paper , where he and grossmann consider ` generally covariant ' equations for the first time .",
    "after having presented his argument , he ends  7 ( and his contribution ) with the following sentences , expressing his conviction in the validity of the principle of general covariance :    [ quote : einstein1 ] ich mu  freilich zugeben , da  fr mich das wirksamste argument dafr , da  eine derartige theorie [ eine skalare gravitationstheorie ] zu verwerfen sei , auf der berzeugung beruht , da  die relativitt nicht nur orthogonalen linearen substitutionen gegenber besteht , sondern einer viel weitere substitutionsgruppe gegenber .",
    "aber wir sind schon desshalb nicht berechtigt , dieses argument geltend zu machen , weil wir nicht imstande waren , die ( allgemeinste ) substitutionsgruppe ausfindig zu machen , welche zu unseren gravitationsgleichungen gehrt . has to be abandoned rests on the conviction that relativity holds with respect to a much wider group of substitutions than just the linear - orthogonal ones .",
    "however , we are not justified to push this argument since we were not able to determine the ( most general ) group of substitutions which belongs to our gravitational equations . _ ] ( @xcite , vol.4 , doc.13 , p.323 )    the other source where einstein reports in more detail on his earlier experiences with scalar gravity is his manuscript entitled `` einiges ber die entstehung der allgemeinen relativittstheorie '' , dated june20th 1933 , reprinted in ( @xcite , pp.176 - 193 ) .",
    "there he describes in words ( no formulae are given ) how the ` obvious ' special - relativistic generalisation of the poisson equation ,    [ eq : newtongravity ] @xmath1 together with a ( slightly less obvious ) special - relativistic generalisation of the equation of motion , @xmath2    lead to a theory in which the vertical acceleration of a test particle in a static homogeneous vertical gravitational field depends on its initial horizontal velocity and also on its internal energy content . in his own words :    [ quote : einstein2 ] solche untersuchungen fhrten aber zu einem ergebnis , das mich in hohem ma mitrauisch machte .",
    "gem der klassischen mechanik ist nmlich die vertikalbeschleunigung eines krpers i m vertikalen schwerefeld von der horizontalkomponente der geschwindigkeit unabhngig .",
    "hiermit hngt es zusammmen , da die vertikalbeschleunigung eines mechanischen systems bzw .",
    "dessen schwerpunktes in einem solchen schwerefeld unabhngig herauskommt von dessen innerer kinetischer energie .",
    "nach der von mir versuchten theorie war aber die unabhngigkeit der fallbeschleunigung von der horizontalgeschwindigkeit bzw .",
    "der inneren energie eines systems nicht vorhanden . dies pate nicht zu der alten erfahrung , da die krper alle dieselbe beschleunigung in einem gravitationsfeld erfahren .",
    "dieser satz , der auch als satz ber die gleichheit der trgen und schweren masse formuliert werden kann , leuchtete mir nun in seiner tiefen bedeutung ein .",
    "ich wunderte mich i m hchsten grade ber sein bestehen und vermutete , da in ihm der schlssel fr ein tieferes verstndnis der trgheit und gravitation liegen msse .",
    "an seiner strengen gltigkeit habe ich auch ohne kenntnis des resultates der schnen versuche von etvs , die mir",
    " wenn ich mich richtig erinnere ",
    "erst spter bekannt wurden , nicht ernsthaft gezweifelt .",
    "nun verwarf ich den versuch der oben angedeuteten behandlung des gravitationsproblems i m rahmer der speziellen relativittstheorie als inadquat .",
    "er wurde offenbar gerade der fundamentalsten eigenschaft der gravitation nicht gerecht .",
    "[ ... ] wichtig war zunchst nur die erkenntnis , da eine vernnftige theorie der gravitation nur von einer erweiterung des relativittsprinzips zu erwarten war .",
    "the important insight at this stage was that a reasonable theory of gravitation could only be expected from an extension of the principle of relativity . _ ] ( einstein , 2005 , pp.178 - 179 )    einstein s belief , that scalar theories of gravity are ruled out , placed him  in this respect  in opposition to most of his colleagues , like nordstrm , abraham , mie , and laue , who took part in the search for a ( special- ) relativistic theory of gravity .",
    "( concerning nordstrms theory and the einstein - nordstrm interaction , compare the beautiful discussions by norton  @xcite@xcite .",
    "some of them were not convinced , it seems , by einstein s inconsistency argument .",
    "for example , even after gr was completed , laue wrote a comprehensive review paper on nordstrms theory , thereby at least implicitly claiming inner consistency  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , this paper of laue s is not contained in his collected writings .",
    "on the other hand , modern commentators seem to be content with a discussion of the key rle that einstein s arguments undoubtedly played in the development of gr and , in particular , the requirement of general covariance .",
    "in fact , already in his famous vienna lecture ( @xcite , vol.4 , doc.17 ) held on september 23rd 1913 , less than half a year after the submission of the entwurf paper , einstein admits the possibility to sidestep the energy - violation argument given in the latter , if one drops the relation between space - time distances as given by the minkowski metric on one hand , and physically measured times and lengths on the other .",
    "einstein distinguishes between `` coordinate distances '' ( german original : `` koordinatenabstand '' ) , measured by the minkowski metric , and `` natural distances '' ( german original : `` natrliche abstnde '' ) , as measured by rods and clocks ( @xcite , vol.4 , doc.17 , p.490 ) .",
    "the relation between these two notions of distance is that of a conformal equivalence for the underlying metrics , where the `` natural '' metric is obtained from the minkowski metric by multiplying it with a factor that is proportional to the square of the scalar gravitational potential .",
    "accordingly , the re - publication in january 1914 of the entwurf paper includes additional comments , the last one of which acknowledges this possibility to sidestep the original argument against special - relativistic scalar theories of gravity ( @xcite , vol.4 , doc.26 , p.581 ) .",
    "this is sometimes interpreted as a `` retraction '' by einstein of his earlier argument ( @xcite , vol.4 , doc.13 , p. 342 , editors comment [ 42 ] ) though einstein himself speaks more appropriately of `` evading '' or `` sidestepping '' ( german original : `` entgehen '' ) .",
    "in fact , einstein does not say that his original argument was erroneous , but rather points out an escape route that effectively changes the hypotheses on which it was based .",
    "indeed , einstein s re - interpretation of space - time distances prevents the poincar transformations from being isometries of space - time , though they formally remain symmetries of the field equations .",
    "the new interpretation therefore pushes the theory outside the realm of sr . hence einstein s original claim , that a special - relativistic scalar theory of gravity is inconsistent , is _ not _ withdrawn by that re - interpretation .",
    "unfortunately , einstein s recollections do not provide sufficient details to point towards a unique theory against which his original claim may be tested . but guided by einstein s remarks and simple first principles one can write down a special - relativistic scalar theory and check whether it really suffers from the shortcomings of the type mentioned by einstein .",
    "this we shall do in the main body of this paper .",
    "we shall find that , as far as its formal consistency is concerned , the theory is much better behaved than suggested by einstein .",
    "we end by suggesting another rationale ( than violation of energy conservation ) , which is also purely intrinsic to the theory discussed here , for going beyond minkowski geometry .",
    "in this section we show how to construct a special - relativistic theory for a scalar gravitational field , @xmath3 , coupled to matter .",
    "before we will do so in a systematic manner , using variational methods in form of a principle of stationary action , we will mention the obvious first and naive guesses for a poincar invariant generalisation of formulae ( [ eq : newtongravity ] ) and point out their deficiencies .",
    "our conventions for the minkowski metric are ` mostly minus ' , that is , @xmath4 . given a worldline , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is some arbitrary parameter , its derivative with respect to its eigentime , @xmath7 , is written by an overdot , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 denotes the velocity of light in vacuum ( which we do not set equal to unity ) .",
    "there is an obvious way to generalise the left hand side of ( [ eq : newtongravity1 ] ) , namely to replace the laplace operator by minus ( due to our ` mostly minus ' convention ) the dalembert operator : @xmath11 this is precisely what einstein reported :    [ quote : einstein3 ] das einfachste war natrlich , das laplacesche skalare potential der gravitation beizubehalten und die poisson gleichung durch ein nach der zeit differenziertes glied in naheliegender weise so zu ergnzen , da der speziellen relativittstheorie genge geleistet wurde .",
    "( einstein , 2005 , p.177 )    also , the right hand side of ( [ eq : newtongravity1 ] ) need to be replaced by a suitable scalar quantity ( @xmath12 is not a scalar ) . in sr",
    "the energy density is the @xmath13-component of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath14 , which corresponds to a mass density @xmath15 .",
    "hence a sensible replacement for the right - hand side of ( [ eq : newtongravity1 ] ) is : @xmath16 so that ( [ eq : newtongravity1 ] ) translates to @xmath17 the replacement ( [ eq : rhotot ] ) is not discussed in einstein s 1933 recollections , but mentioned explicitly as the most natural one for scalar gravity in einstein s part of the entwurf paper ( @xcite , vol.4 , doc.13 , p.322 ) and also in his vienna lecture ( @xcite , vol.4 , doc.17 , p.491 ) . in both cases he acknowledges laue as being the one to draw his attention to @xmath18 as being a natural choice for the scalar potential s source .",
    "the next step is to generalise ( [ eq : newtongravity2 ] ) . with respect to this problem einstein",
    "remarks :    [ quote : einstein4 ] auch mute das bewegungsgesetz des massenpunktes i m gravitationsfeld der speziellen relativittstheorie angepat werden .",
    "der weg hierfr war weniger eindeutig vorgeschrieben , weil ja die trge masse eines krpers vom gravitationspotential abhngen konnte .",
    "dies war sogar wegen des satzes von der trgheit der energie zu erwarten .",
    "( einstein , 2005 , p.177 )    it should be clear that the structurally obvious choice , for @xmath19 . ]",
    "@xmath20 can not work .",
    "four - velocities are normed , @xmath21 so that @xmath22 hence ( [ eq : supernaiveeqmot ] ) implies the integrability condition @xmath23 , saying that @xmath3 must stay constant along the worldline of the particle , with renders ( [ eq : supernaiveeqmot ] ) physically totally useless .",
    "the reason for this failure lies in the fact that we replaced the three independent equations ( [ eq : newtongravity2 ] ) by four equations .",
    "this leads to an over - determination , since the four - velocity still represents only three independent functions , due to the kinematical constraint ( [ eq : fourvelsquare ] ) .",
    "more specifically , it is the component parallel to the four - velocity @xmath24 of the four - vector equation ( [ eq : supernaiveeqmot ] ) that leads to the unwanted restriction . the obvious way out it to just retain the part of ( [ eq : supernaiveeqmot ] ) perpendicular to @xmath24 :    [ eq : naiveeqmot ] @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27    is the one - parameter family of projectors orthogonal to the four - velocity @xmath28 , one at each point of the particle s worldline .",
    "hence , by construction , this modified equation of motion avoids the difficulty just mentioned .",
    "we will call the theory based on ( [ eq : fieldeq ] ) and ( [ eq : naiveeqmot ] ) the _ naive theory_. we also note that ( [ eq : naiveeqmot ] ) is equivalent to @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a spacetime dependent mass , given by @xmath31 here @xmath32 is a constant , corresponding to the value of @xmath30 at gravitational potential @xmath33 , e.g. , @xmath34 .    we could now work out consequences of this theory .",
    "however , before doing this , we would rather put the reasoning employed so far on a more systematic basis as provided by variational principles .",
    "this also allows us to discuss general matter couplings and check whether the matter coupling that the field equation ( [ eq : fieldeq ] ) expresses is consistent with the coupling to the point particle , represented by the equation of motion ( [ eq : naiveeqmot ] ) .",
    "this has to be asked for if we wish to implement the equivalence principle in the following form :    all forms of matter ( including test particles ) couple to the gravitational field in a universal fashion .",
    "we will see that in this respect the naive theory is not quite correct .",
    "we stress the importance of coupling schemes , without which there is no logical relation between the field equation and the equation of motion for ( test- ) bodies .",
    "this is often not sufficiently taken into account in discussions of scalar theories of gravity ; compare  @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "let us now employ standard variational techniques to establish poincar - invariant equations for the scalar gravitational field , @xmath3 , and for the motion of a test particle , so that the principle of universal coupling is duly taken care of .",
    "we start by assuming the field equation ( [ eq : fieldeq ] ) .",
    "an action whose euler - lagrange equation is ( [ eq : fieldeq ] ) is easy to guess has the physical dimension of a squared velocity , @xmath35 that of length - over - mass .",
    "the pre - factor @xmath36 gives the right hand side of ( [ eq : actionfieldint ] ) the physical dimension of an action .",

    "] : @xmath37 where @xmath38 , given by the first term , is the action for the gravitational field and @xmath39 , given by the second term , accounts for the interaction with matter .    to this",
    "we have to add the action for the matter , @xmath40 , which we only specify insofar as we we assume that the matter consists of a point particle of rest - mass , since in the sequel we never need to distinguish between rest- and dynamical mass",
    ". from now on @xmath30 will always refer to rest mass . ]",
    "@xmath30 and a ` rest ' of matter that needs not be specified further for our purposes here .",
    "hence @xmath41 ( rom = rest of matter ) , where @xmath42 we now invoke the principle of universal coupling to find the particle s interaction with the gravitational field",
    ". it must be of the form @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the trace of the particle s energy momentum tensor .",
    "the latter is given by @xmath45 so that the particle s contribution to the interaction term in ( [ eq : actionfieldint ] ) is @xmath46 hence the total action can be written in the following form : @xmath47 by construction , the field equation that follows from this action is ( [ eq : fieldeq ] ) , where the energy momentum - tensor refers to the matter without the test particle ( the self - gravitational field of a _ test _",
    "particle is always neglected ) .",
    "the equations of motion for the test particle then turn out to be    [ eq : particlemotion ] @xmath48    three things are worth remarking at this point :    * the projector @xmath49 now appears naturally . * the difference between ( [ eq : naiveeqmot ] ) and ( [ eq : particlemotion ] ) is that in the latter it is @xmath50 rather than @xmath3 that drives the four acceleration .",
    "this ( only ) difference to the naive theory was imposed upon us by the principle of universal coupling , which , as we have just seen , determined the motion of the test particle .",
    "this difference is small for small @xmath51 , since , according to ( [ eq : particlemotion3 ] ) , @xmath52 .",
    "but it becomes essential if @xmath3 gets close to @xmath53 , where @xmath50 diverges and the equations of motion become singular .",
    "we will see below that the existence of the critical value @xmath54 is not necessarily a deficiency and that it is , in fact , the naive theory which displays an unexpected singular behaviour ( cf .",
    "section[sec : naivescalar ] ) . *",
    "the universal coupling of the gravitational field to matter only involves the trace of energy - momentum tensor of the latter . as a consequence of the tracelessness of the pure electromagnetic energy - momentum tensor",
    ", there is no coupling of gravity to the _ free _ electromagnetic field , like , e.g. , a light wave in otherwise empty space .",
    "a travelling electromagnetic wave will not be influenced by gravitational fields .",
    "hence this theory predicts no deflection of light - rays that pass the neighbourhoods of stars of other massive objects , in disagreement with experimental observations .",
    "note however that the interaction of the electromagnetic field with other matter will change the trace of the energy - momentum tensor of the latter .",
    "for example , electromagnetic waves trapped in a material box with mirrored walls will induce additional stresses in the box s walls due to radiation pressure .",
    "this will increase the weight of the box corresponding to an additional mass @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the energy of the radiation field . in this sense",
    "_ bound _ electromagnetic fields _ do _ carry weight .",
    "let us now focus on the equations of motion specialised to static situations .",
    "that is , we assume that there exists some inertial coordinate system @xmath57 with respect to which @xmath3 and hence @xmath50 are static , i.e. , @xmath58 .",
    "we have    [ prop : scaltheqmotnewtonianform1 ] for static potentials ( [ eq : particlemotion ] ) is equivalent to @xmath59 where here and below we write a prime for @xmath60 and use the standard shorthands @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 .",

    "einstein s second quote suggests that he also arrived at an equation like ( [ eq : scaltheqmotstat1 ] ) , which clearly displays the dependence of the acceleration in the direction of the gravitational field on the transversal velocity .",
    "we will come back to this in the discussion section",
    ".    we can still reformulate ( [ eq : scaltheqmotstat1 ] ) so as to look perfectly newtonian ( i.e. @xmath79 equals a gradient field ) .",

    "we recall that in quote2 scalar gravity was accused of violating a particular form of the principle of the universality of free fall , which einstein called `` the most fundamental property of gravitation '' . in this section",
    "we will investigate the meaning and correctness of this claim in some detail",
    ". it will be instructive to compare the results for the scalar theory with that of a vector theory in order to highlight the special behaviour of the former , which , in a sense explained below , is just opposite to what einstein accuses it of .",

    "moreover , the really surprising feature of ( [ eq : naivescaldropeigentime ] ) is that @xmath107 stays finite for @xmath144 .",
    "in fact , @xmath145 .",
    "so even though the solution @xmath146 is globally regular , the solution to the equations of motion is in a certain sense not , since the freely falling particle reaches the ` end of spacetime ' in finite proper time .",
    "this is akin to ` timelike geodesic incompleteness ' , which indicates singular space - times in gr .",
    "note that it need not be associated with a singularity of the gravitational field itself , except perhaps for the fact that the very notion of an infinitely extended homogeneous field is itself regarded as unphysical .      for comparison",
    "it is instructive to look at the corresponding problem in a vector ( spin1 ) theory , which we here do not wish to discuss in detail .",
    "it is essentially given by maxwell s equations with appropriate sign changes to account for the attractivity of like ` charges ' ( here masses ) .",
    "this causes problems , like that of runaway solutions , due to the possibility to radiate away negative energy .",
    "but the problem of free fall in a homogeneous gravitoelectric field can be addressed , which is formally identical to that of free fall of a charge @xmath147 and mass @xmath30 in a static and homogeneous electric field @xmath148 .",
    "so let us first look at the electrodynamical problem .",
    "the equations of motion ( the lorentz force law ) are @xmath149 where @xmath150 and all other components vanish . hence ,",
    "writing @xmath151 we have    [ eq : vecteqmot ] @xmath152    with the same initial conditions as in the scalar case we immediately have @xmath153 ( [ eq : vecteqmot1 ] ) and ( [ eq : vecteqmot4 ] ) are equivalent to @xmath154 which twice integrated lead to @xmath155 where @xmath156 , and @xmath157 are four constants of integration .",

    "it is literally the same in a vector theory of gravity , we just have to keep in mind that the ` charge ' @xmath147 is now interpreted as gravitational mass , which is to be set equal to the inertial mass @xmath30 , so that @xmath165",
    ". then @xmath166 becomes equal to the ` gravitoelectric ' field strength @xmath167 , which directly corresponds to the strength @xmath113 of the scalar gravitational field .",
    "having said this , we can directly compare ( [ eq : vectdroptimes ] ) with ( [ eq : scaldroptimes ] ) . for small field strength",
    "we see that in both cases @xmath126 is larger by a factor of @xmath130 than @xmath107 , which just reflects ordinary time dilation .",
    "however , unlike in the scalar case , the eigentime span @xmath107 also depends on @xmath130 in the vector case .",
    "the independence of @xmath107 on the initial horizontal velocity is therefore a special feature of the scalar theory .",
    "let us reconsider einstein s statements in quote[quote : einstein2 ] , in which he dismisses scalar gravity for it predicting an unwanted dependence on the vertical acceleration on the initial horizontal velocity .",
    "as already noted , we do not know exactly in which formal context einstein derived this result ( i.e. what the `` von mir versuchten theorie '' mentioned in quote[quote : einstein2 ] actually was ) , but is seems most likely that he arrived at an equation like ( [ eq : scaltheqmotstat1 ] ) , which clearly displays the alleged behaviour . in any case , the diminishing effect of horizontal velocity onto vertical acceleration is at most of _ quadratic _ order in @xmath168 .",
    "[ rem : whyeinsteinsconviction ] how could einstein be so convinced that such an effect did not exist ? certainly there were no experiments at the time to support this .",
    "and yet he asserted that such a prediction `` did not fit with the _ old experience _ [ my italics ] that all bodies experience the same acceleration in a gravitational field '' ( cf .",
    "quote[quote : einstein2 ] ) .",
    "what was it based on ?",
    "one way to rephrase / interpret einstein s requirement is this : the time it takes for a body in free fall to drop from a height @xmath169 to the ground should be independent of its initial horizontal velocity .",
    "more precisely , if you drop two otherwise identical bodies in a static homogeneous vertical gravitational field at the same time from the same location , one body with vanishing initial velocity , the other with purely horizontal initial velocity , they should hit the ground simultaneously .",
    "but that is clearly impossible to fulfil in _ any _ special - relativistic theory of gravity based on a scalar field .",
    "the reason is this : suppose @xmath170 is the gravitational field in one inertial frame .",
    "then it takes exactly the same form in any other inertial frame which differs form the first one by 1 )  spacetime translations , 2 )  rotations about the @xmath86 axis , 3 )  boosts in any direction within the @xmath171-plane .",
    "so consider a situation where with respect to an inertial frame , @xmath172 , body1 and body2 are simultaneously released at time @xmath87 from the origin , @xmath88 , with initial velocities @xmath173 and @xmath174 respectively .",
    "one is interested whether the bodies hit the ground simultaneously .",
    "the ` ground ' is represented in spacetime by the hyperplane @xmath109 and ` hitting the ground ' is taken to mean that the word - line of the particle in question intersects this hyperplane .",
    "let another inertial frame , @xmath175 , move with respect to @xmath172 at speed @xmath176 along the @xmath162 axis .",
    "with respect to @xmath175 both bodies are likewise simultaneously released at time @xmath177 from the origin , @xmath178 , with initial velocities @xmath179 and @xmath180 respectively , according to the relativistic law of velocity addition . the field is still static , homogeneous , and vertical with respect to @xmath175 .",
    "this is a special feature of scalar theories .",
    "for example , in a vector theory , in which in @xmath172 the field is static homogeneous with a vertical electric component and no magnetic component , we would have a static homogeneous and vertical electric component in @xmath175 , but also a static homogeneous _",
    "horizontal _ magnetic component in @xmath181-direction . ] in @xmath175 the ` ground ' is defined by @xmath182 , which defines the _ same _ hyperplane in spacetime as @xmath109 .",
    "this is true since @xmath172 and @xmath175 merely differ by a boost in @xmath162direction , so that the @xmath86 and @xmath183 coordinates coincide . hence ` hitting the ground '",
    "has an invariant meaning in the class of inertial systems considered here .",
    "however , if ` hitting the ground ' are simultaneous events in @xmath172 they can not be simultaneous in @xmath175 and vice versa , since these events differ in their @xmath162 coordinates .",
    "this leads us to the following    [ rem : nosimhitground ] due to the usual relativity of simultaneity , the requirement of ` hitting the ground simultaneously ' can not be fulfilled in any poincar invariant scalar theory of gravity .",
    "but there is an obvious reinterpretation of ` hitting the ground simultaneously ' , which makes perfect invariant sense in sr , namely the condition of ` hitting the ground after the same lapse of eigentime ' .",
    "as we have discussed in detail above , the scalar theory does indeed fulfil this requirement ( independence of ( [ eq : scaldropeigentime ] ) from @xmath130 ) whereas the vector theory does not ( dependence of ( [ eq : vectdropeigentime ] ) on @xmath130 ) .",
    "[ rem : scalardistinguished ] the scalar theory is distinguished by its property that the eigentime for free fall from a given altitude does _ not _ depend on the initial horizontal velocity .    in general , with regard to this requirement ,",
    "the following should be mentioned :    [ rem : einsteins reqnotimplied ] einstein s requirement is ( for good reasons ) not implied by any of the modern formulations of the ( weak ) equivalence principle , according to which the worldline of a freely falling test - body ( without higher mass - multipole - moments and without charge and spin ) is determined by its initial spacetime point and four velocity , i.e. independent of the further constitution of the test body . in contrast , einstein s requirement relates two motions with _",
    "different _ initial velocities .",
    "finally we comment on einstein s additional claim in quote[quote : einstein2 ] , that there is also a similar dependence on the vertical acceleration on the internal energy .",
    "this claim , too , does not survive closer scrutiny .",
    "indeed , one might think at first that ( [ eq : scaltheqmotstat1 ] ) also predicts that , for example , the gravitational acceleration of a box filled with a gas decreases as temperature increases , due to the increasing velocities of the gas molecules . but",
    "this arguments incorrectly neglects the walls of the box which gain in stress due to the rising gas pressure .",
    "according to ( [ eq : fieldeq ] ) more stress means more weight .",
    "in fact , a general argument due to laue  @xcite shows that these effects precisely cancel .",
    "this has been lucidly discussed by norton  @xcite and need not be repeated here .",
    "we already mentioned that the scalar theory does not predict any deflection of light in a gravitational field , in violation to experimental results .",
    "but in order to stay self contained it is also of interest to see directly that the system given by the field equation ( [ eq : fieldeq ] ) and the equation of motion for a test particle ( [ eq : particlemotion ] ) violates experimental data .",
    "this is the case if applied to planetary motion , more precisely to the precession of the perihelion .",
    "recall that the newtonian laws of motion predict that the line of apsides remains fixed relative to absolute space for the motion of a body in a potential with @xmath184falloff .",
    "any deviation from the latter causes a rotation of the line of apsides within the orbital plane .",
    "this may also be referred to as precession of the periapsis , the orbital point of closest approach to the centre of force , which is called the perihelion if the central body happens to be the sun .",
    "again we compare the result of our scalar theory with that of the naive scalar theory and also with that of the vector theory .",
    "there exist comprehensive treatments of periapsis precession in various theories of gravity , like  @xcite .",
    "but rather than trying to figure out which ( if any ) of these ( rather complicated ) calculations apply to our theory , at least in a leading order approximation , it turns out to be easier , more instructive , and mathematically more transparent to do these calculations from scratch .",
    "a convenient way to compute the periapsis precession in perturbed @xmath184potentials is provided by the following proposition , which establishes a convenient and powerful technique for calculating the periapsis precession in a large variety of cases .",
    "[ prop : ll - periadvformula ] consider the newtonian equations of motion for a test particle of mass @xmath30 in a perturbed newtonian potential @xmath185 where @xmath186 and @xmath187 is the perturbation .",

    "let @xmath189 denote the increase of the polar angle between two successive occurrences of periapsis .",
    "hence @xmath190 represents the excess over a full turn , also called the ` periapsis shift per revolution ' .",

    "clearly this method allows to calculate in a straightforward manner the periapsis shifts for general perturbations @xmath227 .",
    "for example , the case @xmath228 is related to the contribution from the quadrupole moment of the central body .",

    "the static and rotationally symmetric solution to ( [ eq : fieldeq ] ) outside the point source is @xmath229 , so that @xmath230 in order to normalize the potential so that it assumes the value zero at spatial infinity we just need to drop the constant term .",

    "in this section we finally turn to einsteins argument of the entwurf paper concerning energy conservation . from a modern viewpoint ,",
    "einstein s claim of the violation of energy conservation seems to fly in the face of the very concept of poincar invariance .",
    "after all , time translations are among the symmetries of the poincar group , thus giving rise to a corresponding conserved noether charge .",
    "its conservation is a theorem and can not be questioned .",
    "the only thing that seems logically questionable is whether this quantity does indeed represent physical energy .",
    "so how could einstein arrive at his conclusion ?",
    "einstein first pointed out that the source for the gravitational field must be a scalar built from the matter quantities alone , and that the only such scalar is the trace @xmath278 of the energy - momentum tensor ( as pointed out to einstein by laue , as einstein acknowledges , calling @xmath278 the `` laue scalar '' ) . moreover , for _ closed stationary systems _ , the so - called laue - theorem  @xcite for static systems ( later slightly generalised to stationary ones ) states that the space integral of @xmath14 must vanish , except for @xmath279 ; hence the space integral of @xmath278 equals that of @xmath280 , which means that the total ( active and passive ) gravitational mass of a closed stationary system equals its inertial mass .",
    "however , if the system is not closed , the weight depends on the stresses ( the spatial components @xmath281 ) .",
    "r0.3 ( -5,17)@xmath282 ( -57,58) strut ( -72,56)_b _ ( -30,98 )    90shaft    his argument proper is then as follows ( compare fig.[fig : slidingbox ] ) : consider a box , @xmath283 , filled with electromagnetic radiation of total energy @xmath167 .",
    "we idealise the walls of the box to be inwardly perfectly mirrored and of infinite stiffness , so as to be able to support normal stresses ( pressure ) without suffering any deformation .",
    "the box has an additional vertical strut in the middle , connecting top and bottom walls , which supports all the vertical material stresses that counterbalance the radiation pressure , so that the side walls merely sustain normal and no tangential stresses .",
    "the box can slide without friction along a vertical shaft whose cross section corresponds exactly to that of the box .",
    "the walls of the shaft are likewise idealised to be inwardly perfectly mirrored and of infinite stiffness .",
    "the whole system of shaft and box is finally placed in a homogeneous static gravitational field , @xmath282 , which points vertically downward .",
    "now we perform the following process .",
    "we start with the box being placed in the shaft in the upper position",
    ". then we slide it down to the lower position ; see fig.[fig : loweringbox ] .",
    "there we remove the side walls of the box  without any radiation leaking out  such that the sideways pointing pressures are now provided by the shaft walls .",
    "the strut in the middle is left in position to further support all the vertical stresses , as before .",
    "then the box together with the detached side walls are pulled up to their original positions ; see fig.[fig : raisingbox ] .",
    "finally the system is reassembled so that it assumes its initial state .",
    "einstein s claim is now that in a very general class of imaginable scalar theories the process of pulling up the parts needs less work than what is gained in energy in letting the box ( with side walls attached ) down .",
    "hence he concluded that such theories necessarily violate energy conservation .",
    "indeed , radiation - plus - box is a closed stationary system in laue s sense .",
    "hence the weight of the total system is proportional to its total energy , @xmath167 , which we may pretend to be given by the radiation energy alone since the contributions from the rest masses of the walls will cancel in the final energy balance , so that we may formally set them to zero at this point . lowering this box by an amount @xmath169 in a static homogeneous gravitational field of strength @xmath113 results in an energy gain of @xmath284 .",
    "so despite the fact that radiation has a traceless energy - momentum tensor , _ trapped _ radiation has a weight given by @xmath285 .",
    "this is due to the radiation pressure which puts the walls of the trapping box under tension . for each parallel pair of side - walls",
    "the tension is just the radiation pressure , which is one - third of the energy density .",
    "so each pair of side - walls contribute @xmath286 to the ( passive ) gravitational mass ( over and above their rest mass , which we set to zero ) in the lowering process when stressed , and zero in the raising process when unstressed .",
    "hence , einstein concluded , there is a net gain in energy of @xmath287 ( there are two pairs of side walls ) .",
    "but it seems that einstein neglects a crucial contribution to the energy balance .",
    "in contrast to the lowering process , the state of the shaft _ is _ changed during the lifting process , and it is this additional contribution which just renders einstein s argument inconclusive .",
    "indeed , when the side walls are first removed in the lower position , the walls of the shaft necessarily come under stress because they now need to provide the horizontal balancing pressures . in the raising process that stress distribution of the shaft",
    "is translated upwards .",
    "but that _ does _ cost energy in the theory discussed here , even though it is not associated with any proper transport of the material the shaft is made from .",
    "as already pointed out , stresses make their own contribution to weight , independent of the nature of the material that supports them .",
    "in particular , a redistribution of stresses in a material immersed in a gravitational field generally makes a non - vanishing contribution to the energy balance , even if the material does not move .",
    "this will be seen explicitly below .",
    "there seems to be only one paper which explicitly expresses some uneasiness with einstein s argument , due to the negligence of `` edge effects '' ( @xcite , p.37 ) , however without going into any details , letting alone establishing energy expressions and corresponding balance equations .",
    "there are 10 conserved currents corresponding to poincar - invariance .",
    "in particular , the total energy @xmath167 relative to an inertial system is conserved . for a particle coupled to gravity",
    "it is easily calculated and consists of three contributions corresponding to the gravitational field , the particle , and the interaction - energy shared by the particle and the field :    [ eq : energies ] @xmath288    let us return to general matter models and let @xmath289 be the total stress - energy tensor of the gravity - matter - system .",
    "it is the sum of three contributions : @xmath290 where , it is given by @xmath291 , which here ( generally for scalar fields ) gives rise to a symmetric tensor , @xmath292 . ]",
    "[ eq : em - tensors ] @xmath293    energy - momentum - conservation is expressed by @xmath294 where @xmath295 is the four - force of a possible _ external _ agent .",
    "the 0-component of it ( i.e. energy conservation ) can be rewritten in the form @xmath296 for any bounded spatial region @xmath297 .",
    "if the matter system is itself of finite spatial extent , meaning that outside some bounded spatial region , @xmath297 , @xmath298 vanishes identically , and if we further assume that no gravitational radiation escapes to infinity , the surface integral in ( [ em - conservation2 ] ) vanishes identically . integrating ( [ em - conservation2 ] ) over time",
    "we then get @xmath299 with @xmath300 and where @xmath301 denotes the difference between the initial and final value of @xmath302 . if we apply this to a process that leaves the _ internal _ energies of the gravitational field and the matter system unchanged , for example a processes where the matter system , or at least the relevant parts of it , are _ rigidly _ moved in the gravitational field , like in einstein s gedankenexperiment of the ` radiation - shaft - system ' , we get @xmath303 now , my understanding of what a valid claim of energy non - conservation in the present context would be is to show that _ this _ equation can be violated . but",
    "this is _ not _ what einstein did ( compare conclusions ) .",
    "if the matter system stretches out to infinity and conducts energy and momentum to infinity , then the surface term that was neglected above gives a non - zero contribution that must be included in ( [ em - conservation4 ] )",
    ". then a proof of violation of energy conservation must disprove this modified equation .",
    "( energy conduction to infinity as such is not in any disagreement with energy conservation ; you have to prove that they do not balance in the form predicted by the theory . )      for the discussion of einstein s gedankenexperiment the term ( [ interaction - energy ] ) is the relevant one .",
    "it accounts for the _ weight of stress_. pulling up a radiation - filled box inside a shaft also moves up the stresses in the shaft walls that must act sideways to balance the radiation pressure .",
    "this lifting of stresses to higher gravitational potential costs energy , according to the theory presented here .",
    "this energy was neglected by einstein , apparently because it is not associated with a transport of matter .",
    "he included it in the lowering phase , where the side - walls of the box are attached to the box and move with it , but neglected them in the raising phase , where the side walls are replaced by the shaft , which does not move .",
    "but as far as the ` weight of stresses ' is concerned , this difference is irrelevant .",
    "what ( [ interaction - energy ] ) tells us is that raising stresses in an ambient gravitational potential costs energy , irrespectively of whether it is associated with an actual transport of the stressed matter or not .",
    "this would be just the same for the transport of heat in a heat - conducting material .",
    "raising the heat distribution against the gravitational field costs energy , even if the material itself does not move .",
    "from the foregoing i conclude that , taken on face value , neither of einstein s reasonings that led him to dismiss scalar theories of gravity prior to being checked against experiments are convincing .",
    "first , energy  as defined by noether s theorem_is _ conserved in our model - theory . note also that the energy of the free gravitational field is positive definite in this theory .",
    "second , the _ _",
    "eigen__time for free fall in a homogeneous static gravitational field _ is _ independent of the initial horizontal velocity .",
    "hence our model - theory serves as an example of an internally consistent theory which , however , is experimentally ruled out . as we have seen , it predicts @xmath304 times the right perihelion advance of mercury and also no light deflection ( not to mention shapiro time - delay , gravitational red - shift , as well as other accurately measured effects which are correctly described by gr ) .",
    "the situation is slightly different in a special - relativistic vector theory of gravity ( spin1 , mass0 ) . here",
    "the energy is clearly still conserved ( as in any poincar invariant theory ) , but the energy of the radiation field is negative definite due to a sign change in maxwell s equations which is necessary to make like charges ( i.e. masses ) attract rather than repel each other .",
    "hence there exist runaway solutions in which a massive particle self - accelerates unboundedly by radiating negative gravitational radiation .",
    "also , the free - fall eigentime now does depend on the horizontal velocity , as we have seen .",
    "hence , concerning these theoretical aspects , scalar gravity is much better behaved .",
    "this leaves the question unanswered why einstein thought it necessary to give up the identification of minkowski geometry with the physical geometry , as directly measured with physical clocks and rods ( cf .",
    "the discussion at the end of section[sec : histbackground ] ) .",
    "einstein made it sound as if this was the only way to save energy conservation .",
    "this , as we have seen , is not true .",
    "but there may well be other reasons to contemplate more general geometries than that of minkowski space from considerations of scalar gravity as presented here , merely by looking at the gravitational interaction of models for ` clocks ' and ` rods ' .",
    "a simple such model would be given by an electromagnetically bound system , like an atom , where ( classically speaking ) an electron orbits a charged nucleus ( both modelled as point masses ) .",
    "place this system in a gravitational field that varies negligibly over the spatial extent of the atom and over the time of observation . the electromagnetic field produced by the charges",
    "will be unaffected by the gravitational field ( due to its traceless energy momentum tensor ) .",
    "however , ( [ eq : scalgrav4 ] ) tells us that the dynamics of the particle is influenced by the gravitational field .",
    "the effect can be conveniently summarised by saying that the masses of point particles scale by a factor of @xmath305 when placed in the potential @xmath50 .",
    "this carries over to quantum mechanics so that atomic length scales , like the bohr radius ( in mksa units ) @xmath306 and time scales , like the rydberg period ( inverse rydberg frequency ) @xmath307 change by a factor @xmath308 due to their inverse proportionality to the electron mass @xmath30 ( @xmath169 is planck s constant , @xmath147 the electron charge , and @xmath309 the vacuum permittivity ) .",
    "this means that , relative to the units on which the minkowski metric is based , atomic units of length and time vary in a way depending on the potential . transporting the atom to a spacetime position in which the gravitational potential differs by an amount @xmath310 results in a diminishment ( if @xmath311 ) or enlargement ( if @xmath312 ) of its size and period _ relative to minkowskian units_. this effect is universal for all atoms .",
    "the question then arises as to the physical significance of the minkowski metric .",
    "should we not rather _ define _ spacetime lengths by what is measured using atoms ?",
    "after all , as einstein repeatedly remarked , physical notions of spatial lengths and times should be based on physically constructed rods and clocks which are consistent with our dynamical equations .",
    "the minkowski metric would then merely turn into a redundant structure with no _ direct _ observational significance . from that perspective",
    "one may indeed criticise special - relativistic scalar gravity for making essential use of dispensable absolute structures , which eventually should be eliminated , just like in the ` flat - spacetime - approach ' to gr ; compare  @xcite and sect.5.2 in @xcite .",
    "in view of quote[quote : einstein1 ] one might conjecture that this more sophisticated point was behind einstein s criticism .",
    "if so , it is well taken .",
    "but physically it should be clearly separated from the other explicit accusations which we discussed here .",
