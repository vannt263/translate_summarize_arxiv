    "the last two decades have seen the discovery of a number of moving groups and associations near the earth containing young stars with ages in the range @xmath010 to 100  myr ( for reviews see @xcite and @xcite ) . by studying stars in these moving groups",
    "we can observe the evolution of stellar properties as a function of age .",
    "identifying additional members , particularly fainter , low - mass stars , is key to understanding the processes involved in the earliest stages of stellar , substellar , and massive planet evolution .",
    "low - mass stars with ages ranging from 10100  myr are luminous sources of x - rays with respect to their bolometric luminosities ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "several successful searches for nearby young stars exploited their characteristically large x - ray activities to identify promising candidates @xcite .",
    "in addition to x - ray activity , however , young low mass stars also exhibit larger chromospheric activity than their older counterparts ( as measured by the @xmath1 index ; see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "higher chromospheric activity is correlated with increased ultraviolet emission in stars @xcite .",
    "hence , when compared to the older population of low mass stars , young stars will stand out as being uv - bright ( for example , see figure  3 in @xcite ) .",
    "the galaxy evolution explorer satellite ( galex , @xcite ) has performed a number of large area surveys in the far - ultraviolet ( fuv , 13441786 ) and near - ultraviolet ( nuv , 17712831 ) . the all - sky imaging survey ( ais ) , in particular , has covered @xmath03/4 of the sky , and hence represents an excellent tool to identify uv - bright sources . however , in order not to damage its detectors , galex generally does not point within 10 degrees of the galactic plane .",
    "even with this limitation , galex has already explored the regions covered by many nearby , young stellar associations @xcite .    a previous study performed in the taurus and upper scorpius regions used galex to identify candidate young stars @xcite . however , these regions are populated by stars with ages @xmath25  myr .",
    "we have successfully applied a similar strategy ( described in   [ method ] ) to search for nearby stars with ages 10100  myr and with spectral types later than k5 using archival data available in the galex gr4/5 data release .",
    "the search strategy we have employed consists of identifying uv - excess , late - type objects using nuv - optical / nir colors . with available proper motion data from the literature , we perform a uvw space velocity analysis and the best candidate objects are selected for spectroscopic followup .",
    "we describe our method in detail in sections 2.12.3 .      to examine whether 10 to 100  myr old stars stand out in the ultraviolet , we compare the absolute nuv magnitudes for stars in @xcite , which lists members of many of the young , nearby stellar associations , with the  catalogue of nearby stars , 3rd edition \" by @xcite ; most the latter are considerably older than a few 100 myr . in particular , we used the catalog provided in @xcite , which lists accurate coordinates for most of the stars in @xcite . to identify uv sources we make use of casjobs , an interface to query the galex database .",
    "the results are displayed in figures  [ fig : nuvabs ] and [ fig : nuvv ] .",
    "it is clear from these figures that young stars stand out from the older population .",
    "in particular , stars with v  k@xmath33.5 ( @xmath0m0 ) and ages as old as 70  myr ( the ab  dor group in @xcite ) are brighter in nuv than the older gliese stars ; the only exceptions are flare stars ( from @xcite or simbad ) and some multiple systems ( from @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "galex has a psf fwhm of 5  and , hence , can not resolve binary systems with much smaller separations .",
    "additionally , in some close binary systems ( such as rs cvn - type systems ) the component stars can interact with one another and may produce additional uv emission .",
    "the only exception to this trend of brighter nuv magnitudes for young stars is bd  + 01  2447 , classified by @xcite ( @xcite ; see also references within ) as an ab  dor member , with v ",
    "k@xmath04.3 , which we discuss later in   [ additional ] .",
    "[ fig : nuvv ] , which displays nuv  v colors for these stars , also shows how young stars stand out .",
    "reddening towards these objects can significantly affect the shorter wavelengths .",
    "@xcite apply a reddening curve in which @xmath4 ; however , using the reddening curve of @xcite and @xmath5 , we obtain @xmath6 . while most gliese stars are within 25  pc , most of the young stars are more distant .",
    "regardless of the exact value for @xmath7 , extinction towards the younger , more distant objects will generally be higher than for the nearby gliese stars .",
    "thus the effect of extinction will be to bring the locus of the young star populations in figs .",
    "[ fig : nuvabs ] and [ fig : nuvv ] closer to the gliese old star locus .",
    "that is , the intrinsic separation in absolute nuv magnitude and in nuv ",
    "v between young and old stars is , if anything , somewhat greater on average than indicated in figs .",
    "[ fig : nuvabs ] and [ fig : nuvv ] .",
    "young , early - m stars in these associations ( with ages 1030  myr ) tend to have absolute nuv magnitudes between 1516 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : nuvabs ] ) .",
    "the 3-@xmath8 sensitivity for the galex ais survey is 22.0 magnitudes for each 100-second exposure , which means that these young stars could be detected at the 3-@xmath8 level out to at least 160  pc .",
    "@xcite estimate that galex can detect unextincted photospheres of k5 stars out to 140  pc with 300-second exposures , implying absolute nuv magnitudes of about 17 .",
    "mid - k stars with ages of 70  myr , however , have absolute nuv magnitudes generally brighter than 15 , suggesting that even at 70  myr , these stars will be about 2 magnitudes brighter than their older counterparts ( as illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : nuvabs ] at v ",
    "k@xmath03 ) .",
    "as previously mentioned , extinction towards these objects will cause them to have redder nuv  v colors similar to that of older field stars .",
    "extinction of ( at least ) @xmath9 magnitudes would be required for 70  myr - old mid - k stars to have nuv magnitudes comparable to equally distant , but older , mid - k stars .    to see if these 10100  myr - old systems also stand out as uv - bright in galex-2mass colors , and to carry out a pilot study for the feasibility of a large scale program , we examine a region of sky encompassing the tw  hya association ( twa ) . after defining a suitable search region (",
    "see table  [ tab : fields ] ) , we select all objects detected in nuv ( our initial search of the tw hya association also required detection in fuv ) .",
    "these sources are then cross - matched with the 2mass point source catalog @xcite with a matching radius of 2 , somewhat larger than the galex pointing uncertainty ( @xmath01 , * ? ? ?",
    "this allows us to produce color - color plots like the one in figure  [ fig : colors ] . in these plots ,",
    "galaxies tend to lie in a well defined region of space ( between about 0.5@xmath10j  k@xmath102 and 2@xmath10nuv  j@xmath107 ) while stars follow a diagonal line from j  k@xmath00 and nuv ",
    "j@xmath02 to j  k@xmath01 and nuv  j@xmath013 .",
    "the black symbols in figure  [ fig : colors ] are the twa stars from @xcite , all of which lie below the stellar sequence ; tw hya is the object with nuv ",
    "the stellar locus is well defined by an average of the relations in @xcite ( @xcite ; see their equation  2 ) and we have plotted this as a solid line in figure  [ fig : ages ] . also shown",
    "are the 10100  myr old stars , which can again be distinguished from older field stars in that they lie below the stellar sequence ( i.e. , they have uv excesses ) .",
    "the thick solid line represents the best linear fit to the locus of young stars , and illustrates the difference between the young and old stellar populations , particularly for the lower mass stars ( j  k @xmath11 0.7 ) .",
    "while the separation is not as pronounced as in the nuv ",
    "v plots , clearly these diagrams should enable one to select candidate young , low - mass stars using only galex and 2mass colors .    in figures  [ fig : colors ] and",
    "[ fig : ages ] , the young stars of the twa all lie below the stellar sequence . however , there is some scatter , and not every object with uv excess will be a young star .",
    "for example , flare stars are known contaminants in young star x - ray searches , and the same is true for our uv - selection methods ( see also figs .  [",
    "fig : nuvabs ] and  [ fig : nuvv ] ) .",
    "we select objects with uv excesses similar to those of the known young stars ( defined algebraically by nuv ",
    "j @xmath2 10.20(j  k ) @xmath12 2.2 ) and j  k between 0.7 and 1 , as most m - type stars have j  k colors of about 0.8 .",
    "our selection criteria is illustrated in figure  [ fig : selection ] along with our candidate objects ( see   [ results ] ) and fits to the old and young stellar locus as described above ( see also fig  [ fig : ages ] ) .",
    "to distinguish between candidate young stars and other uv excess sources , we make use of proper motion information available in the literature . in particular , we use the usno - b1 @xcite , ucac3 @xcite , and ppmx @xcite proper motion catalogs , which can be accessed from the topcat virtual observatory tool . in some cases",
    "we also check the ppmxl catalog @xcite .",
    "our uv excess sources are matched against all three catalogs , compared with proper motions of members in the association of interest , and then merged while removing duplicate entries . in cases where one catalog has a proper motion that is discrepant from the others , we favor the proper motions listed in ucac3 and ppmx .",
    "we next estimate galactic space velocities ( uvw ) for candidate stars .",
    "this step requires estimates for distances and radial velocities . in order to obtain photometric distances",
    ", we estimate spectral types using available broadband photometry ( for example , data from denis @xcite or the proper motion catalogs listed above ) . from the spectral type we estimate photometric distances using empirical and theoretical isochrones for young stars of ages 10 and 100  myr ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "because nearly all candidates lack radial velocities , we use these distance estimates ( along with the positions and proper motions ) to estimate galactic uvw with respect to the sun for a range of velocities extending from @xmath13 to 80  km / s . @xcite",
    "define a  good uvw box \" that contains nearly all young stars .",
    "if any object has uvw within this box , that is , uvw within 0 to @xmath14 , @xmath15 to @xmath16 , and @xmath17 to @xmath18  km  s@xmath19 , they are flagged for followup . in this case u is defined as positive towards the galactic center .",
    "follow up for all candidates so identified involves first checking against known association members . in the twa ,",
    "for example , nearly all known members are recovered via the above methodology , including some that are not included in @xcite but are present in older compilations , such as those in @xcite .",
    "the candidates are searched in simbad as well , though most have no simbad entry and only limited information in vizier .",
    "candidates considered for spectroscopic followup are those with a broad range of radial velocities that would give uvw velocities consistent with nearby , young star status and photometric distances consistent with other members in the association of interest",
    ". the presence and strength of li 6708  absorption in the spectrum can indicate whether or not the object is young ( see figure  3 in * ? ? ? * and the associated discussion in   5.1 of the same paper ) .",
    "a high - resolution spectrum can also be used to determine the radial velocity of the candidate object , which can then be used to better constrain its uvw velocities .    although the presence of li for stars of the spectral types of interest ( k5 and later ) is a strong indication of youth , lithium burning is very sensitive to stellar mass ( and thus spectral type ) . for example , @xmath20  pic moving group stars ( @xmath012  myr ) of spectral types m34 show very little li in their spectra @xcite .",
    "hence , a non - detection of lithium absorption does not immediately imply the system is old , particularly for later m spectral types . as demonstrated by @xcite , lithium depletion models tend to predict much weaker li absorption at any given age .",
    "using such models would yield far greater ages for @xmath012  myr m3.5m5 stars . because many of our candidates fall in this range",
    ", a non - detection would imply a system is older than about 10  myr , but does not provide an upper limit to this age . such a system could , however , still be a member of a young association . in such cases ,",
    "membership could be confirmed via accurate distance , proper motion , and radial velocity measurements .",
    "we have used the method described in section  [ method ] to perform a search for young stars in the tw hya association ( twa , @xmath08  myr , 4060  pc ; @xcite , and references therein ) and the scorpius  centaurus region @xcite . the sco  cen region is divided into a number of associations : upper scorpius ( us , @xmath056  myr old ) , upper centaurus - lupus ( ucl , @xmath01415  myr ) , and lower centaurus - crux ( lcc , @xmath01112  myr ) , which are located about 120140  pc distant @xcite10  myr old . ] . in order to limit our searches to a manageable number of objects ( the galex catalog casjobs search interface has built - in memory limits ) , we divided the sco  cen search into a set of 4 ra / dec centroids , each with a given radius ( see table  [ tab : fields ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : fields ] ) .",
    "there is some overlap between these regions , so the resulting lists of objects ( after cross - correlating with 2mass ) were merged and duplicate entries were removed .",

    "we identified @xmath0150 promising candidates through this methodology . in order to select the best objects to observe",

    "we have performed a search in the twa and sco  cen region and recovered 54 high - quality candidates . of these , we observed 24 spectroscopically and detected lithium absorption , an indicator of youth , in at least 17 m1m5 systems .",
    "those with no lithium absorption have spectral types m3.5m4.5 , a range where lithium is believed to be depleted within @xmath010  myr @xcite .",
    "these systems may very well be young , albeit not younger than 10  myr .",
    "detection of he  i emission at 5876  and 6678  for 8 systems ( some of which had no lithium absorption ) is also consistent with young ages for these stars .",
    "the detection of lithium in at least 2/3 of the 24 spectroscopically observed stars suggests many of the other high - quality candidates may also be young stars , and perhaps others lie among the 100 + uv - excess stars with possible good uvw from which those candidates were drawn .",
    "most of our objects lack rass detections within 1  of their 2mass coordinates ; however , these tend to have upper limits of log  @xmath29 , consistent with late - type stars that have been detected in the rass . because mid to late m - type stars have small @xmath66 , many would escape detection in rass even if log  @xmath29 .",
    "while deeper x - ray observations can be performed with chandra or xmm , these will eventually cover only a few percent of the sky .",
    "this suggests that uv - selection criteria , such as the one we describe in this paper , may ultimately prove a more powerful tool than x - rays to identify nearby , young , low - mass stars .",
    "we thank simon murphy for providing the high resolution spectrum for 2m112544 and the referee for useful suggestions .",
