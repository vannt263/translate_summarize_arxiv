    "quantum graphs ( networks ) of one - dimensional wires connected at nodes were introduced already more than half a century ago to model physical systems . to the best of our knowledge , they appeared for the first time in connection with free electron models of organic molecules @xcite .",
    "the molecules were visualized as a set of atoms at fixed locations connected by bond paths , along which the electrons obey a one - dimensional schrdinger equation with an appropriate potential . in recent years",
    "the interest in quantum graphs has been revived in many areas of physics , and in particular in the context of condensed matter physics . amongst the systems which were successfully modeled by quantum graphs we mention e.g. , studies of super - conductivity in granular and artificial materials @xcite , single - mode acoustic and electro - magnetic waveguide networks @xcite , anderson transition @xcite and quantum hall systems with long range potential @xcite , fracton excitations in fractal structures @xcite , and mesoscopic quantum systems @xcite .",
    "the construction of the wave equations for such networks is a topic in its own right .",
    "ruedenberg and scherr @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , who were apparently among the first to address the problem , based their formulation on the analysis of the limit of wires of finite thickness .",
    "quantum graphs can be considered as idealizations of physical networks in the limit where the widths of the wires are much smaller than all the other length scales in the problem .",
    "thus , neglecting the lateral size of the wire , i.e. , assuming that the propagating waves remain in a single transverse mode , one replaces the corresponding partial differential schrdinger equation by an ordinary differential operator .",
    "this can be justified assuming that the inter - mode coupling involves a dynamical tunneling and therefore it diminishes exponentially with the decreasing wire thickness .",
    "moreover , when no external field is applied , the motion on the bonds is free , and the problem can be further reduced to finite matrices @xcite .",
    "alexander @xcite was probably the first to discuss networks in external magnetic fields .",
    "quantum graphs attracted the attention of the mathematics community as well .",
    "j. p. roth @xcite was probably the first to derive a trace formula for the spectrum of a laplacian on graphs .",
    "recently the problem came of age in a series of mathematical works by exner and seba @xcite , avron @xcite and carlson @xcite , whose formulation is based on the von - neumann theory of self - adjoint extensions of formal differential operators ( see also @xcite and references therein ) .    in spite of all this activity",
    ", the statistical properties of the spectra displayed by quantum graphs were hardly investigated in the past @xcite .",
    "our motivation for studying these spectral properties comes from the theory of quantum chaos which deals with quantum systems exhibiting chaotic motion in the classical limit .",
    "one of the main observations of this field is that in the extreme case , when classical motion is strongly chaotic , and in the limit @xmath0 , the statistical properties of spectra are well described by random matrix theory ( rmt ) . at the same time , the spectra of quantized integrable systems display poissonian statistics .",
    "an important goal of quantum chaology , is to develop a theory , which relates the quantum spectral statistics to the underlying features of classical dynamics .",
    "the main tool in this endeavour consists of trace formulae which provide an expression for the spectral density in terms of classical periodic manifolds - isolated orbits for chaotic systems , and tori for integrable ones . in most cases ,",
    "only the semiclassical approximation for the trace formulae are known @xcite and their application is not only hampered by the intrinsic complexity of the set of periodic orbits , but also by the doubts about the ability of the semiclassical trace formulae to provide accurate enough basis for the further developments .",
    "this motivated the introduction and the study of particular  toy \" systems where the required periodic - orbit data can be easily accumulated , while at the same time the trace formulae are exact rather than semi - classical @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , only very few models combine the desirable features of both behaving `` typically '' and being mathematically simple .",
    "it is the main purpose of this paper to propose quantum graphs as a very convenient and rich class of systems where the above mentioned requirements are met satisfactorily .",
    "we shall show that for quantum graphs , one can write an exact trace formula , which is based on  periodic orbits \" in a way which is analogous to the known trace formulae for chaotic systems . moreover , we shall define the corresponding underlying classical dynamics , and write down the relevant frobenius perron operator for the  phase space \" evolution .",
    "this analogy will enable us to study further the connection between spectral fluctuations and the classical dynamics .",
    "another clear advantage of quantum graphs is the relative ease by which a large number of spectral data can be computed .",
    "this enables a rather accurate numerical studies of systems and problems for which analytical results are lacking or insufficient .",
    "this paper extends our previous report @xcite on the spectral properties of quantum graphs , both in detail and depth .",
    "in particular , we address issues which have to do with the transition which the spectral statistics undergo when the connectivity of the graph is altered .",
    "this problem is intimately connected with the semiclassical theory of anderson localization .",
    "we also add another parameter to the model , which enables us to interpolate between dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions .",
    "we show that this induces a transition between integrable and chaotic dynamics , and we study its effect on the spectral statistics .",
    "the paper is structured in the following way . in sec .",
    "ii , the mathematical model is introduced and the main definitions are given . in sec .",
    "iii we are describing three methods of quantizing graphs .",
    "the first method is rather standard ( see e.g.,@xcite ) and it is the most convenient for numerical computations .",
    "the two other methods are related to the scattering approach to quantization @xcite .",
    "one of them forms the basis for the development of the exact trace formula , and it singles out a unitary matrix of dimension @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the number of bonds on the graph .",
    "this matrix is the main building block of our theory , and we refer to it as the  bond scattering matrix \" @xmath3 .",
    "an alternative quantization condition is achieved in terms of the  vertex scattering matrix \" @xmath4 .",
    "it is of dimension @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the number of vertices , and it describes the transport through a system in which each of the vertices is attached to a conducting wire . in section",
    "iv we present the trace formula for the quantum graph , and also express the spectral @xmath7 function as a sum over composite periodic orbits .",
    "section iv terminates with the introduction and the discussion of the underlying classical system . in section",
    "v , the statistical properties of the eigenphase spectrum of the bond scattering matrix @xmath3 and of the energy ( or wavenumber ) spectrum are analyzed and compared with the predictions of rmt and of periodic orbits theory . in section vi , we analyze two families of graphs which are not uniformly connected .",
    "the resulting spectral statistics deviate from the expectations of rmt , and we explain these deviations using periodic orbit theory . within this study ,",
    "we investigate also the localization / delocalization transition experienced by graphs as a function of the connectivity .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in the last section ( section vii ) .",
    "in this section we shall present and discuss the schrdinger operator for graphs .",
    "we start with a few definitions .",
    "graphs consist of @xmath6 _ vertices _ connected by @xmath2 _ bonds _ ( or _ edges _ ) .",
    "the _ valency _",
    "@xmath8 of a vertex @xmath9 is the number of bonds meeting at that vertex .",
    "the graph is called @xmath10_-regular _ if all the vertices have the same valency @xmath10 .",
    "when the vertices @xmath9 and @xmath11 are connected , we denote the connecting bond by @xmath12 . the same bond can also be referred to as @xmath13 or @xmath14 whenever we need to assign a direction to the bond .",
    "several bonds connecting the same two vertices are called multiple bonds and the corresponding graph is called a multi - graph .",
    "finally , a bond with coinciding endpoints is called a _",
    "loop_. in what follows , unless explicitly specified , we shall consider graphs without multiple bonds or loops .",
    "moreover , we shall treat only connected graphs .",
    "associated to every graph is its _ connectivity ( adjacency ) matrix _ @xmath15 .",
    "it is a square matrix of size @xmath6 whose matrix elements @xmath15 are given in the following way @xmath16 for loop - less graphs the diagonal elements of @xmath17 are zero .",
    "the connectivity matrix of connected graphs can not be written as a block diagonal matrix .",
    "the valency of a vertex is given in terms of the connectivity matrix , by @xmath18 and the total number of bonds is @xmath19 . as will be shown bellow ( sec .",
    "iv.c ) , the topological characterization of the graph which was given above , is sufficient for the study of `` classical dynamics '' on graphs .    for the quantum description we assign to each bond @xmath12 a coordinate @xmath20 which indicates the position along the bond .",
    "@xmath20 takes the value @xmath21 at the vertex @xmath9 and the value @xmath22 at the vertex @xmath11 while @xmath23 is zero at @xmath11 and @xmath24 at @xmath9 .",
    "we have thus defined the _ length matrix _",
    "@xmath24 with matrix elements different from zero , whenever @xmath25 and @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "the derivations presented in the sequel are valid for any choice of the lengths @xmath24",
    ". however , in some applications we would avoid non generic degeneracies by assuming that the @xmath24 are _ rationally independent_. the mean length is defined by @xmath28 .",
    "the wavefunction @xmath29 is a @xmath30component vector and will be written as @xmath31 where the set @xmath32 consists of @xmath2 different bonds .",

    "the bond coordinates @xmath35 were defined above .",
    "when there is no danger of confusion , we shall use the shorthand notation @xmath36 for @xmath33 and it is understood that @xmath37 is the coordinate on the bond @xmath34 to which the component @xmath38 refers .",
    "the schrdinger operator ( with @xmath39 ) is defined on the graph in the following way @xcite : on each bond @xmath34 , the component @xmath38 of the total wave function @xmath29 is a solution of the one - dimensional equation @xmath40 we included a  magnetic vector potential \" @xmath41 ( with @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) which breaks the time reversal symmetry . in most applications we shall assume that all the @xmath44 s are equal and",
    "the bond index will be dropped .",
    "the wave function must satisfy boundary conditions at the vertices , which ensure continuity ( uniqueness ) and current conservation .",
    "the imposition of these boundary conditions guarantees that the resulting schrdinger operator is self - adjoint .",
    "the continuity condition requires that at each vertex @xmath9 , the wave function assume a value denoted by @xmath45 which is independent of the bond from where the vertex is approached .",
    "current conservation imposes a condition on the derivatives of the wave function at the vertices . by assuming that @xmath46 the conditions are explicitly specified in the following way . for every @xmath47 : @xmath48 the parameters @xmath49 are free parameters which determine the boundary conditions . in many applications we shall assume that the @xmath49 are all equal , and in such cases the vertex index will be dropped . in the case when @xmath50 , the matching conditions can be represented by a @xmath51-function potential of strength @xmath49 . by analogy",
    ", we shall refer to the @xmath52 as the _ vertex scattering potential_. in the sequel , we shall always assume that @xmath53 and will consider the domain @xmath54 ( which excludes states bounded at a single vertex ) .",

    "dirichlet boundary conditions are introduced when all the @xmath55 .",

    "a finite value of @xmath52 introduces a new length scale .",
    "it is natural therefore , to interpret it in physical terms as a representation of a local impurity or an external fields @xcite .",
    "we finally note that the above model can be considered as a generalization of the kronig - penney model to a multiply connected , yet one dimensional manifold .",
    "the set of boundary conditions ( [ current ] ) , discussed in the previous section , ensures that the schrdinger operator ( [ schrodinger ] ) is self - adjoint , and hence the existence of an unbounded , discrete spectrum @xmath57 . in the following three subsections",
    "we shall introduce three different approaches which can be used for the calculation of the wavenumbers spectrum @xmath58 .",
    "these approaches complement each other and enable us to address various aspects of the quantum graphs using different points of view .",
    "the eigenfunctions of the graph are completely determined by their values at the vertices @xmath59 .",

    "this can be easily rectified by replacing the diverging terms by @xmath69    the secular equations ( [ secu]-[secus ] ) for the quantized graph can be solved numerically to provide an arbitrarily large sequence of eigenvalues @xmath70 .    as we said previously , the effect of the dirichlet boundary condition on all the vertices ( @xmath71 ) is to disconnect the bonds .",
    "the eigenfunctions in this case have a simple structure : they vanish on all the bonds except on one of the bonds , @xmath34 , where @xmath72 for all @xmath34 .",

    ", however , all intermediate boundary conditions converge to the neumann limit .",
    "the quantization of graphs can be accomplished in a different way which although less efficient from the numerical point of view , provides us with a natural and convenient starting point for the construction of the trace formula .",
    "it is an example of the scattering approach to quantization @xcite .",
    "another variant of this method will be presented in the following subsection .",
    "we first introduce the scattering matrix related to a single vertex .",
    "this is done by solving an auxiliary problem of a single vertex @xmath9 , say , with @xmath74 emanating bonds which extend to infinity .",
    "the wave - function @xmath75 has components on all the bonds @xmath76 , which emerge from the @xmath9 vertex ( note that we enumerate and denote the bonds in the auxiliary problem by their analogues on the original graph ) .",
    "@xmath75 can be written as a linear combination of functions @xmath77 which are solutions for the case where there is an incoming wave entering @xmath9 from @xmath78 and outgoing waves from @xmath9 to all bonds @xmath79 ( including @xmath80 which correspond to the reflected part ) .",
    "@xmath77 is a @xmath81dimensional vector with components @xmath82 for all @xmath83 , @xmath84 here the @xmath85 are the distances from the vertex @xmath9 along the bonds @xmath86 , and @xmath87 is the @xmath88 scattering matrix , which provides a transformation between the incoming and the outgoing waves at the vertex @xmath9 .",
    "the matching conditions  ( [ current ] ) at the vertex ( @xmath89 ) together with ( [ scat1 ] ) , can be used to determine @xmath90 : @xmath91 for the dirichlet boundary conditions we get @xmath92 which indicates total reflection . for the neumann boundary condition",
    "@xmath93 which is independent of @xmath60 . for any intermediate boundary condition ,",
    "the parameter that controls the scattering process is the @xmath60 dependent parameter @xmath94 the scattering matrix approaches the neumann expression as @xmath95 .",
    "note that in all the non trivial cases ( @xmath96 ) , back - scattering ( @xmath97 ) is singled out both in sign and in magnitude : @xmath98 has always a negative real part , and the reflection probability @xmath99 approaches @xmath100 as the valency @xmath74 increases .",
    "one can easily check that @xmath101 is a symmetric unitary matrix , ensuring flux conservation and time reversal symmetry at the vertex . for the neumann boundary conditions @xmath101 is a real orthogonal matrix .",
    "we now write the general expression for an eigenfunction of the quantum graph in terms of its components on the bonds @xmath12 .",
    "we write the _ same _ bond wave function in two ways .",
    "first , we use the standard notation introduced before and call it @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the distance from @xmath9 .",
    "the second representation employs the  time reversed \" notation where the wave function is denoted by @xmath104 and @xmath105 is the distance from @xmath11 .",
    "the general expressions for the wave function in the two representations read @xmath106 the two representations describe the same function .",
    "this gives , @xmath107 in other words , but for a phase factor , the outgoing wave from the vertex @xmath9 in the direction @xmath11 is identical to the incoming wave at @xmath11 coming from @xmath9 .",

    "this distinction corresponds to assigning directions to the bonds , so that @xmath112 and @xmath113 are considered as different entities .",
    "we thus see that the present approach for quantizing the graph singles out the description in terms of _ directed bonds _ as the natural setup .",

    "the matrix elements of @xmath118 assign an amplitude to a transition from one directed bond to another .",
    "such a transition can occur only if the directed bonds are connected , that is , one is incoming and the other is outgoing from the same vertex .",
    "the phase and magnitude of the amplitude is given by the corresponding matrix element of the single vertex scattering matrix .",
    "> from ( [ secular ] ) it follows that @xmath120 belongs to the wavenumber spectrum if and only if @xmath121 has an eigenvalue @xmath122 .",
    "as no approximations were made at any step of the derivation , this quantization condition is exact .",
    "furthermore , this gives a constructive method to obtain not only the eigen - energies , but also the wave function , in terms of the eigenvector of @xmath121 with the eigenvalue @xmath122 @xcite .",
    "the  bond scattering matrix \" @xmath3 can not be associated with an actual scattering system in the usual sense of scattering theory .",
    "nevertheless we shall keep referring to it as a scattering matrix , since it yields a quantization condition which is of the standard form in the scattering approach .",
    "we finally comment that we use the letter @xmath123 to denote the secular function ( [ secular ] ) , because it can be cast in a form which is reminiscent of the riemann - siegel expression for the riemann @xmath7 function on the critical line .",

    "the graph spectrum can be identified as the set of wavenumbers for which @xmath4 has @xmath100 as an eigenvalue .",

    "the analogy between po s on the graph and periodic orbits in dynamical systems follows naturally from the classical dynamics which we associate with the graph .",
    "this analogy is strengthened by further evidence : the number of @xmath183 po s on the graph is @xmath204 , where @xmath17 is the connectivity matrix .",
    "since its largest eigenvalue @xmath205 is bounded between the minimum and the maximum valency i.e. @xmath206 , periodic orbits proliferate exponentially with topological entropy @xmath207 .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath198 which play the rle of the stability amplitudes , decrease exponentially with @xmath147 but not enough to make the series for @xmath208 absolutely convergent ( positive entropy barrier ) .",
    "finally , @xmath193 is the analogue of the maslov index .",
    "its origin is topological , and it counts the number of non trivial back scatters along the po .",
    "this can be expressed as the number of sequences of strings of the type @xmath209 ( with @xmath210 ) which appear in the code of the po .",
    "the distinguishing feature of the graph trace formula is the structure of the spectrum of lengths @xmath211 of the periodic orbits which appear in ( [ traceformula ] ) .",
    "in contrast with the other systems mentioned above , the lengths are constructed as linear combinations ( with integer coefficients ) of the elementary bond lengths @xmath73 . hence , the lengths spectrum is characterized by a high degree of degeneracy .",
    "the degeneracy is not too important for po s of period @xmath212 .",
    "as @xmath147 increases , it becomes progressively dominant , and it is the main feature of the length spectrum for periodic orbits with @xmath213 .",
    "the effects of this degeneracy are most apparent in the study of spectral statistics which will be discussed in the next chapter .",
    "the spectral density ( [ traceformula ] ) is not convenient to deal with , since it is not a proper function but , rather , a distribution . in this section",
    "we would like to cast the information which is stored in ( [ traceformula ] ) in a different form , and express it using periodic orbits .",
    "the first method for achieving this goal is based on the identity ( [ tr3 ] ) , where the periodic orbit expression ( [ posum ] ) for @xmath214 is substituted , and the summation over the repetitions is carried out explicitly .",
    "one gets @xmath215 this expression as a product over primitive po s justifies the letter @xmath7 by which the secular function is denoted .",
    "this product does not converge on the real @xmath60 axis because the number of primitive po s proliferates exponentially , with a topological entropy which approximately equals the mean lyapunov exponent @xmath216 .",
    "hence , the product ( [ zeta1 ] ) converges in the absolute sense only for @xmath217 .",
    "this is the  entropy barrier \" for the @xmath218 function . as a matter of fact",
    ", the formal manipulations which were used to derive ( [ zeta1 ] ) are strictly justified beyond the entropy barrier .",
    "a converging , well behaved expression for the @xmath123 function on the real @xmath60 axis can be obtained , and it is the analogue of the riemann siegel expression for the riemann @xmath7 on the critical line . to this end , we first note that the @xmath153 function ( [ secular ] ) , is the characteristic polynomial of the matrix @xmath219 @xmath220 evaluated at @xmath221 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath222 satisfy an inversive symmetry relation which follows from the unitarity of the scattering matrix @xmath219 @xmath223 utilizing relation ( [ ze2 ] ) one may rewrite ( [ szf1 ] ) in a more convenient form @xmath224 we would like to emphasize that this form of the secular function @xmath153 is due to the unitarity of @xmath219 .",
    "thus , the removal of the contributions of terms with @xmath225 in ( [ szf2 ] ) is not only a practical saving of numerical effort , but also an expression of a basic property of the system .",
    "let us now consider the @xmath219 matrix at a given wavenumber @xmath60 .",
    "its spectrum is on the unit circle i.e @xmath226 and @xmath227 becomes a function of @xmath228 which depends parametrically on @xmath60 .",
    "yet , the secular function ( [ szf2 ] ) is not real for real @xmath228 .",
    "it is useful to define another function which is real on the real @xmath228 line , and vanishes at @xmath229 .",
    "thus , we introduce the spectral determinant which is obtained from  ( [ szf1 ] ) by extracting a phase factor @xmath230    the function @xmath231 serves a dual purpose . setting @xmath232",
    "it is a real secular equation for the graph . for a fixed value of @xmath60",
    "it is the secular function for the spectrum of @xmath219 .    to write @xmath231 in terms of periodic orbits it is useful to recall newton s identities",
    "@xcite @xmath233    the explicit dependence of the @xmath234 on @xmath235 takes the form @xcite @xmath236 where the summation is over all vectors @xmath237 with integer entries such that @xmath238 by substituting further from  ( [ posum ] ) the @xmath239 we get an expression of the @xmath240 in terms of composite orbits @xcite .",
    "the form obtained above for the spectral @xmath7 function is reminiscent of the riemann - siegel approximation for the riemann @xmath7 on the critical line .",
    "here , however , it is an exact expression , and because of the fact that the density of states is constant , the number of terms appearing in the sum is independent of @xmath60 .",
    "we introduced above the concept of orbits on the graph as strings of vertex labels whose ordering obeyed the required connectivity .",
    "this is a finite coding which is governed by a markovian grammar provided by the connectivity matrix . in this sense ,",
    "the symbolic dynamics on the graph is bernoulli .",
    "so far , the orbits were used and discussed as formal symbols devoid of a _ dynamical _ origin . in the present section",
    "we shall introduce the classical dynamics which can be associated with a graph , and which complements the quantum dynamics on the graph .",
    "the classical dynamics makes use of the representation of the graph in terms of directed bonds . in the following sections we shall use the label @xmath34 to refer to the _ directed _ bonds ,",
    "so that @xmath241 and we shall denote the time reversed pairs by @xmath242 .    we consider a classical particle which moves freely as long as it is on a bond .",
    "the vertices are singular points , and it is not possible to write down the analogue of the newton equations at the vertices .",
    "instead , one can employ a liouvillian approach , based on the study of the evolution of phase - space densities .",
    "the phase space evolution operator assigns transition probabilities between phase space points , for which a quantum analogue can be found .",
    "the phase - space description will be constructed on a poincar section which is defined in the following way .",
    "crossing of the section is registered as the particle encounters a vertex , thus the  coordinate \" on the section is the vertex label . the corresponding  momentum \" is the direction in which the particle moves when it emerges from the vertex .",
    "this is completely specified by the label of the next vertex to be encountered .",
    "in other words , @xmath243    the set of all possible vertices and directions is equivalent to the set of @xmath109 directed bonds .",
    "the evolution on this poincar section is well defined once we postulate the transition probabilities @xmath244 between the directed bonds @xmath245 and @xmath246 .",
    "to make the connection with the quantum description , we adopt the quantum transition probabilities , expressed as the absolute squares of the @xmath3 matrix elements @xmath247 the phases @xmath248 are given in  ( [ smatrix ] ) .",
    "for the two extreme cases , corresponding to neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions ,  ( [ cl1 ] ) results @xmath249    the transition probability @xmath250 for the dirichlet case , admits the following physical interpretation .",
    "the particle is confined to the bond where it started and thus the phase space is divided to non - overlapping ergodic components ( @xmath251``tori '' ) . for all other boundary conditions ,",
    "the graph is dynamically connected .",
    "the classical evolution ( frobenius perron ) operator @xmath252 between the bonds @xmath253 reads @xmath254 @xmath255 does not involve any metric information on the graph , and for dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions @xmath255 is independent of @xmath60 .",
    "if @xmath256 denotes the probability to occupy the bond @xmath34 at the ( topological ) time @xmath257 , then we can write down a markovian master equation for the classical density : @xmath258    the unitarity of the graph scattering matrix @xmath3 guarantees @xmath259 and @xmath260 , so that the probability that the particle is on any bond is conserved during the evolution .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath255 is restricted to the interior of the unit circle and @xmath261 is always an eigenvalue with the corresponding eigenvector @xmath262 . in most cases ,",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath100 is the only eigenvalue on the unit circle .",
    "then , the evolution is ergodic since any initial density will evolve to the eigenvector @xmath263 which corresponds to a uniform distribution ( equilibrium ) .",
    "the rate at which equilibrium is approached is determined by the gap between the next largest eigenvalue and @xmath100 . however , there are some non generic cases , such as e.g. , bipartite graphs when @xmath264 belongs to the spectrum . in this case",
    "the asymptotic distribution is not stationary ( see for example section vii ) . if @xmath100 is the only eigenvalue on the unit circle we have @xmath265 with a mixing rate @xmath266 determined by @xmath267 , the second largest eigenvalue of @xmath255",
    "this is characteristic of a classically mixing system .    of prime importance in the discussion of the relation between the classical and the quantum dynamics are the traces @xmath268 which are interpreted as the mean classical probability to perform @xmath147- periodic motion .",
    "when only one eigenvalue @xmath269 is on the unit circle , one has that @xmath270 . then , we can obtain a classical sum - rule by substituting the periodic orbit expansion of @xmath271 , @xmath272 each periodic orbit is endowed with a weight @xmath273 defined in terms of the stability amplitudes ( [ amplitude ] ) .",
    "it is the probability to remain on the orbit .",
    "these weights are the counterparts of the stability weights @xmath274 is the monodromy matrix .",
    "graphs , however , are one dimensional and the motion on the bonds is simple and stable .",
    "ergodic ( mixing ) dynamics is generated because at each vertex a ( markovian ) choice of one out of @xmath10 directions is made .",
    "chaos on graphs originates from the multiple connectivity of the ( otherwise linear ) system .",
    "_    using the expression ( [ classicalsum ] ) for @xmath271 one can easily write down the complete thermodynamic formalism for the graph . here",
    ", we shall only quote the periodic orbit expression for the ruelle @xmath275 function @xmath276   \\label{cl4 } \\\\ & = & \\exp \\left [ \\sum_n\\frac{z^n}nu_n\\right ] = \\prod_p\\frac 1{\\left ( 1-z^{n_p}\\exp ( -n_p\\gamma _ p)\\right ) ^ { } }   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the product extends over all primitive periodic orbits and we have used the definitions of ( [ amplitude ] ) .",
    "so far we developed the spectral theory of graphs , pointing out the similarity between quantum graphs and more complex quantum systems which display chaotic dynamics in the classical limit . in the present chapter",
    "we shall report about analytical and numerical results which show that the spectral statistics of these simple systems also follow the pattern of more general hamiltonian systems .",
    "namely , when the classical graph dynamics is mixing , and in the limit when the ( topological ) time needed to reach equilibrium is much shorter than the number of directed bonds , the spectral statistics for quantum graphs are very well reproduced by the predictions of random matrix theory . in the integrable limit ( dirichlet boundary conditions ) the graph spectral statistics is poisson as is the case in generic integrable hamiltonian systems .",
    "the investigation of the universality of spectral fluctuations and deviations thereof is especially convenient for graphs because of the transparent and simple spectral theory in terms of po s , and because of the relative numerical ease by which large spectral data bases can be constructed .",
    "the parameters which appear in the theory can be used to study various characteristic spectral transitions : changing the vertex potential parameters @xmath52 ( which , for simplicity , we will choose to be the same for all the vertices i.e.@xmath277 ) induces the transition between classical integrability to chaos .",
    "this is accompanied by a spectral transition from poisson to rmt like statistics .",
    "the parameter @xmath41 ( again for the sake of clarity we will choose @xmath278 for all the bonds ) allows to break time reversal symmetry , and the mean valency can be used to study the dependence of spectral statistics on connectivity .",
    "all these questions will be dealt with in the present chapter .    the spectral theory presented above relied heavily on the bond scattering matrix @xmath3 which provided the foundation for the periodic orbits theory and the connection to the classical evolution .",
    "the spectral statistics of the eigenphases of the @xmath3 matrix are also intimately connected with the spectral statistics of the graph wavenumber spectrum .",
    "therefore , we will start our presentation by discussing the @xmath3 matrix spectral statistics .",
    "we consider the @xmath154 matrices defined in ( [ secular ] , [ scaco ] ) .",
    "their spectrum consist of @xmath109 points confined to the unit circle ( eigenphases ) .",
    "unitary matrices of the type considered here are commonly studied since they are the quantum analogues of classical , area preserving maps .",
    "their spectral fluctuations depend on the nature of the underlying classical dynamics @xcite .",
    "the quantum analogue of classically integrable maps display poissonian statistics while in the opposite case of classically chaotic maps , the eigenphases statistics conform quite accurately with the results of rmt for dyson s _ circular ensembles_. the ensemble of unitary matrices which will be used for the statistical study will be the set of matrices @xmath154 with @xmath60 in the range @xmath279 , where the mid point @xmath280 and the interval size @xmath281 are to be determined . since the dimension of the @xmath3 matrices is independent of @xmath60 ,",
    "the mean value @xmath280 is important only when the boundary conditions are neither neumann nor dirichlet . for the intermediate boundary conditions , @xmath280 sets the mean value of the parameter @xmath282",
    "( [ lambdadef ] ) , and @xmath281 must be chosen such that @xmath283 does not change appreciably in the interval .",
    "however , @xmath281 must be much larger than the correlation length between the matrices @xmath154 .",
    "one can estimate the correlation length by studying the auto - correlation function @xmath284    for the two extreme cases of neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions the auto - correlation function ( [ enscor1 ] ) can be calculated exactly . by writing the scattering matrix as @xmath285 and substituting in ( [ enscor1 ] )",
    "we find : @xmath286 where @xmath287 is the fourier transform of the probability distribution @xmath288 of the lengths of the bonds .",
    "thus , the correlation is inversely proportional to the variance of the distribution of the lengths @xmath73 . from now on",
    ", we shall assume @xmath289 , which justifies the @xmath60 averaging procedure .",
    "the ensemble average will be denoted by @xmath290    another way to generate an ensemble of graphs , is by randomizing the length matrix @xmath133 which contains the lengths of the bonds while the connectivity ( topology of the graph ) is kept constant .",
    "this is the disorder approach , which will also be applied when called for .    in the following subsections vi.a.1 - 2",
    ", we investigate some statistical measures of the eigenphases @xmath291 of the scattering matrix @xmath3 @xcite and compare them with the predictions of rmt , and with the results of the periodic orbits theory of spectral fluctuations which was originally developed for quantized maps .",
    "the two statistics which we shall investigate are the spectral form factor and the autocorrelation of the spectral @xmath7 function .",
    "explicit expressions for these quantities are given by random matrix theory @xcite and a semiclassical theory is also available @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 matrix for a fixed eigenvalue @xmath60 is a unitary matrix with eigenvalues @xmath292 .",
    "the spectral density of the eigenphases then reads @xmath293 where the first term on the r.h.s is the smooth density @xmath294 , while the others describe the fluctuating part .",
    "the two - point correlations are expressed in terms of the excess probability density @xmath295 of finding two phases at a distance @xmath296 , where @xmath296 is measured in units of the mean spacing @xmath297 @xmath298",
    "the form factor @xmath299 is the fourier transform of @xmath300 . for a poisson spectrum , @xmath301 for all @xmath147 .",
    "rmt predicts that @xmath302 , depends on the scaled time @xmath303 only @xcite , and explicit expressions for the orthogonal and the unitary circular ensembles are known @xcite .",
    "we computed @xmath304 for well connected graphs , with various vertex potential parameters . in fig .  1 we show typical examples , calculated for a fully connected pentagon .",
    "the results for neumann boundary conditions show quite a good agreement with the predictions of rmt for the circular ensembles .",
    "we shall discuss and explain these results in the following paragraphs .    to begin , consider the data for neumann boundary conditions and @xmath305 or @xmath306 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the predictions of rmt are also shown , and they reproduce quite well the smooth trend of the data in the two cases .",
    "the deviations from the smooth curves are not statistical , and can not be ironed out by further averaging .",
    "rather , they are due to the fact that the graph is a dynamical system which can not be described by rmt in all detail . to study this point in depth we shall express the form factor in terms of the po expression  ( [ posum ] ) .",
    "assuming neumann boundary conditions for the time being , @xmath307 the @xmath60 averaging is carried out on such a large interval that the double sum above is restricted to pairs of periodic orbits which have exactly the same length .",
    "the fact that we choose the lengths of the bonds to be rationally independent will enter the considerations which follow in a crucial way .",
    "consider first the domain @xmath308 .",
    "the po s are mostly of the irreducible type , and the length restriction limits the sum to pairs of orbits which are conjugated under time reversal . neglecting the contributions from repetitions and from self tracing orbits we get @xmath309 the classical return probability @xmath271 approaches @xmath100 as @xmath147 increases ( see ( [ classicalsum ] ) ) .",
    "however , deviations from unity reflect the fact that the classical dynamics reaches the ergodic state only after some time . the deviation which is simplest to understand occurs at @xmath310 . since there are no classical fixed points ( no self connected vertices ) on the graph , @xmath311 .",
    "however in the limit @xmath312 , the short time deviations converge to the origin when the scaled form factor is studied . neglecting the short time deviations",
    ", we can replace @xmath271 by @xmath100 , and we see that the remaining expression to be evaluated is the classical expectation of @xmath313 over po s of length @xmath147 . for @xmath305 this factor is identically @xmath100 and one obtains the leading term of the coe expression for @xmath314 . if @xmath190 is sufficiently large @xmath315 , and one obtains the short time limit of the cue expression .",
    "the transition between the two extreme situations is well described by @xmath316 this formula is derived by assuming that the total directed length @xmath192 of a periodic orbit is a sum of elementary lengths with random signs .",
    "one can not use the arguments presented above for the range @xmath317 .",
    "as @xmath147 approaches @xmath2 the degeneracy of the length spectrum prevails and for @xmath213 all the orbits are degenerate .",
    "in other words , the restriction @xmath318 in ( [ sms5 ] ) does not pick up a unique orbit and its time reversed partner , but rather , a group of isometric but distinct orbits .",
    "therefore , the interferences of the contributions from the group of all the orbits must be calculated .",
    "the relative sign of the terms is determined by the  maslov \" index .",
    "this can be seen better , once rewriting ( [ sms5 ] ) in the form ( we assume for simplicity @xmath305 ) @xmath319 where the second sum is over the set @xmath320 of po of the type @xmath321 with @xmath322 .",
    "it is clear that the indices of different orbits in a family of isometric po s are _",
    "correlated_. otherwise , if the maslov indices are random , one would regain the diagonal approximation ( [ transuzy1 ] ) for arbitrarily long times .",
    "the correlation between the maslov indices within the family of isometric po s are the analogue of action correlations in the semiclassical theory of spectral statistics .",
    "the dynamical origin of these correlations is not known also for graphs , and it is one of the important open problems that should be addressed",
    ".    graphs with dirichlet boundary conditions are integrable in the sense explained above .",
    "one expects therefore that the spectral statistics in this case is poissonian , which implies @xmath323 in the dirichlet case , the @xmath3 matrix reduces to a block diagonal form where each bond and its time reversed partner are coupled by a @xmath324 matrix of the form @xmath325 the spectrum of each block is the pair @xmath326 , with the corresponding symmetric and antisymmetric eigenvectors @xmath327 . as a result , we get @xmath328    this deviation from the expected poissonian result is due to the fact that the extra symmetry reduces the @xmath3 matrix further into the symmetric and antisymmetric subspaces .",
    "the spectrum in each is poissonian , but when combined together , the fact that the eigenvalues in the two spectra differ only by a sign is the reason for the anomaly ( [ poissonform ] ) . in the sequel",
    "we shall remove this feature by considering the smooth form factor obtained by taking the mean of successive @xmath147 values .",
    "the transition between the two extreme boundary conditions can be affected by using the interpolating boundary conditions where @xmath329 .",
    "the relevant parameters are the @xmath330 defined in ( [ lambdadef ] ) , and it is expected that the spectral statistics make the transition from rmt like to poisson as these parameters spans their range of values . the exact symmetry which prevails in the dirichlet case , is broken for intermediate values of @xmath282 .",
    "however , the tendency towards trapping in a single bond is a dynamical feature , which persists for finite @xmath330 values , and therefore the even - odd staggering of the form factor can be observed also for the intermediate range of @xmath330 values ( see inset in fig .  1 ) .",
    "since the dynamical reason for this effect is clearly understood , we show in fig .  1 the pairwise averaged form factor , which displays clearly the transition from the poissonian to the rmt ( coe and cue ) limit .",
    "as was mentioned above , the short times deviations of the data from the rmt expectations ( see fig",
    ".  1 ) are real , and are due to the deterministic nature of the dynamics induced by the @xmath3 matrices .",
    "it is easy to show this explicitly for @xmath331 , since here all the contributions are due to period-@xmath332 po s which are self tracing , and each has its distinct length . using ( [ posum ] ) we get @xmath333 independently of the value of @xmath190",
    "this is different from the value @xmath334 expected for the cue and @xmath335 expected for the coe .",
    "we conclude this section with an analysis of the spectral @xmath336 function given by  ( [ szf3 ] ) .",
    "the statistical properties of this function , can be expressed in terms of the statistics of either the eigenphases @xmath337 or the coefficients @xmath338 ( see ( [ szf3 ] ) ) .",
    "since the two sets of variables are functionally related , they are statistically equivalent . in practice , however , one can not check the full spectral distribution , and therefore it is advantageous to study statistical measures which are based on other accessible quantities .",
    "the measure which was proposed in @xcite and @xcite was the autocorrelation function @xmath339 this statistical measure , depends on higher order correlations of the eigen - phases .",
    "hence , @xmath340 tests aspects of the eigenvalues distribution which are not accessible by the study of the two - point form factor discussed previously .",
    "the ensemble averages @xmath341 for circular random matrices were calculated in @xcite .",
    "we shall quote here the results for the coe and cue ensembles : @xmath342    an approximate expression for the @xmath343 was obtained by assuming that the @xmath235 are independent random gaussian variables for @xmath344 @xcite .",
    "this approximation is an extension of the diagonal approximation mentioned above , and it leads to the following recursion relation @xmath345 for the calculation of the autocorrelation function ( [ sms6 ] ) , it is sufficient to obtain the @xmath346 for @xmath347 .",
    "the rest are provided by the inverse symmetry ( [ ze2 ] ) which moreover implies that the fourier components of @xmath340 are symmetric about @xmath2 and thus the autocorrelation function is real .",
    "using the approximate result ( [ transuzy1 ] ) for the form factor @xmath348 we have @xcite @xmath349 which should be solved with the initial condition @xmath350 . in ( [ sms8 ] ) @xmath351 for systems with ( without ) time reversal symmetry , and @xmath352 is the classical return probability . for systems which display strong mixing ,",
    "@xmath353 , and the approximate recursion relations reproduce the rmt result for systems which violate time reversal symmetry ( @xmath354 ) . for systems which are invariant under time reversal ,",
    "one reproduces only the leading term in @xmath355 of the rmt result ( @xmath356 ) .",
    "we computed numerically the @xmath357 for the completely connected pentagon , subject to neumann boundary conditions , where time reversal symmetry was either respected ( @xmath305 ) ( fig .",
    "2a ) , or violated ( @xmath306 ) ( fig .",
    "the results are displayed in fig .  2 , and they deviate substantially from the rmt predictions ( [ sms7 ] ) .",
    "note that the values of @xmath358 for the same system showed a rather good agreement with rmt ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the reason for the large deviation is clear .",
    "no physical system can reproduce the strong mixing condition @xmath359 for all @xmath147 .",
    "indeed , this is the reason why @xmath358 deviate from the rmt results for short times .",
    "because of the iterative procedure ( [ sms8 ] ) , the short time non - generic effects reveal themselves in the higher order coefficients @xmath234 , and this is why this statistical measure is much more sensitive to the non universal features of the classical dynamics .",
    "the approximate theory presented above , includes the correct short time behavior of the system , and therefore it reproduces the main features of the numerical data much better than rmt . a quantitative measure for the expected deviation from the rmt prediction",
    "can be given by the magnitude of the next to the leading eigenvalue of the classical evolution operator @xmath255 .",
    "for the system we studied , it is -.25 , which is still far from the value 0 expected in the strong mixing limit .",
    "let us finally comment on the transition from poisson to rmt due to variation of the parameters @xmath161 .",
    "as it was mentioned already in the introduction , for integrable systems , we expect that the spectrum is uncorrelated and described by the poisson ensemble which gives for the @xmath360 the expression @xmath361 on the other hand , the diagonal approximation predicts that @xmath362 ( see previous section ) and thus it provides us with the following recursion relation for the coefficients @xmath363 @xmath364 in fig .",
    "2a , b we present our numerical results for a fully connected pentagon and for various values of the parameter @xmath330 .",
    "again , we see that our system undergoes a transition from goe / gue to poisson statistics when @xmath330 increases .      the statistical properties of the energy levels ( or the wave numbers ) spectrum can be derived from the statistics of the eigenphases of @xmath3 because of the following reasoning .",
    "the wavenumber spectral density can be written as @xmath365 one can easily show that @xmath366 where @xmath367 denote the minimal or the maximal bond length of the graph . consider an interval @xmath368 about @xmath280 so that @xmath369 .",
    "since the mean wavenumber spectral density is @xmath370 the interval @xmath368 can accommodate a large number of levels when @xmath2 is large .",
