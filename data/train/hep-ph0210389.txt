    "the discovery of very small , but non - zero neutrino masses via the observation of oscillations in atmospheric and solar neutrino experiments  @xcite is one of the most exciting results in particle physics in recent years , and may provide important new information to help guide us in the search for new physics beyond the standard model . as we describe here , efforts to uncover a mechanism for generating such small mass differences may also shed light on the nature of non - baryonic dark matter .",
    "the simplest way to introduce neutrino masses into the standard model is to postulate a new right - handed fermion , a singlet under the sm gauge group , that mixes with the sm fermions via a dirac mass term .",
    "unfortunately , in order to obtain neutrino masses below an ev , it is necessary to fine - tune the corresponding yukawa coupling to one part in @xmath0 , which is unacceptable .",
    "thus , more elaborate models are needed .",
    "currently the most popular way to generate small neutrino masses is the _ seesaw _ mechanism  @xcite . in this model one",
    "introduces a right handed neutrino @xmath1 , and allows both majorana and dirac mass terms . since the right handed neutrino is a singlet under the sm gauge group @xmath2",
    ", its mass @xmath3 can be much larger than the electroweak scale without contributing large quantum corrections to the other couplings in the theory .",
    "one may integrate out such a heavy field leaving a majorana neutrino with mass @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the dirac neutrino mass .",
    "the seesaw mechanism arises naturally in many extensions of the standard model gauge group , for example in left - right ( l - r ) models with group @xmath6 , the pati - salam model with group @xmath7 or in @xmath8 grand unified theories ( guts ) .",
    "another possible way of achieving small neutrino masses is to extend the higgs sector of the theory by adding a very heavy triplet scalar field @xmath9 , with mass @xmath10 , which couples to the sm fields via @xmath11 where , @xmath12 is the left - handed lepton doublet , @xmath13 is the standard model higgs doublet and @xmath14 is the charge - conjugation matrix . here",
    "the yukawa couplings @xmath15 are antisymmetric in the generation indices @xmath16 and @xmath17 .    integrating out our heavy triplet @xmath9 one obtains an effective theory whose lagrangian density contains the term @xmath18 where the scale @xmath19 . due to this term , after electroweak symmetry breaking the neutrino gets a mass @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the standard model higgs field .    clearly , in both of these sets of models for generating neutrino masses , it is crucial that the masses of the right - handed neutrino and the scalar triplet respectively are much higher than the electroweak scale . as a consequence ,",
    "these models are difficult to test in collider experiments .",
    "in addition , the existence of a large hierarchy between the electroweak scale and the new physics scale generates its own set of naturalness problems .",
    "here we reconsider the idea that sm neutrinos are massless at tree level , but acquire a nonzero mass at the one - loop level .",
    "a particularly simple example of this idea is provided by the zee model  @xcite in which one augments the sm higgs doublet @xmath22 with a second higgs doublet @xmath23 , and a charged field @xmath24 which transforms as a singlet under @xmath25 .",
    "the lagrangian density then contains the following relevant pieces @xmath26 other extensions of the zee model where small neutrino masses arise at loop levels have also been proposed  @xcite that may have interesting implications for the generation of the baryon asymmetry of the universe  @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we will demonstrate how a variant of the zee model allows the generation of small phenomenologically acceptable neutrino masses and at the same time produces a new viable dark matter candidate near the electroweak scale .",
    "we consider a model with sufficient symmetry that neutrino masses appear only at the three loop level . to achieve this",
    "we supplement the sm fields with two charged scalar singlet scalars @xmath27 and @xmath28 , with masses @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively and one right handed neutrino @xmath1 , with mass @xmath3 .",
    "we break lepton number explicitly by including a majorana mass term for the right - handed neutrino , and impose a discrete @xmath31 symmetry under which the sm fields and @xmath27 are singlets but @xmath28 and @xmath1 transform as @xmath32 forbidding dirac masses for the neutrinos . given this symmetry , the most general renormalizable terms that may be added to the sm lagrangian density @xmath33 in which the potential @xmath34 contains a @xmath35 coupling @xmath36 .",
    "let us assume a mild hierarchy of masses @xmath37 tev and that the yukawa couplings @xmath15 , @xmath38 are of order one .",
    "this implies that @xmath1 is stable if the above discrete symmetry is unbroken .",
    "also , since lepton number is broken , we expect a left handed majorana neutrino mass at the quantum level , and indeed this arises from the three loop diagram in figure  [ figure1 ] .",
    "= 1.0    once again , we integrate out the heavy degrees of freedom @xmath1 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 to obtain an effective theory containing the dimension five operator @xmath39 here the scale @xmath40 is given in terms of the heaviest singlet scalar mass @xmath30 and the yukawa couplings @xmath41 , @xmath15 , @xmath38 and @xmath36 as @xmath42 where a subscript @xmath43 denotes a leptonic quantity",
    ". for @xmath44 tev , we obtain @xmath45 gev and so the model provides a hierarchy between the electron and neutrino masses and yields neutrino masses at the @xmath46 ev scale without involving mass scales significantly larger than a tev .",
    "as we commented above , in our model the right - handed neutrino is stable , since its mass is smaller than @xmath29 and the discrete symmetry @xmath31 is unbroken .",
    "it is natural to wonder whether this stable , neutral , weakly - interacting particle might be a reasonable cold dark matter ( cdm ) candidate . to determine this we need to calculate the relic abundance of right - handed neutrinos produced as the universe cools .",
    "we begin by noting that the right - handed neutrino annihilates into right - handed charged leptons with cross - section given by @xmath47 we also need the standard result that the number density of right - handed neutrinos at the decoupling temperature @xmath48 is @xmath49 freeze - out occurs when @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the effective number of massless degrees of freedom of at decoupling .",
    "therefore , using our expressions for @xmath52 and the cross - section we solve for @xmath53 to obtain @xmath54 where the minus sign in front of the second term arises because the annihilation of @xmath1 is a p - wave process , and where we can ignore the masses of the annihilation products with masses less than @xmath3 . for typical values @xmath55 and @xmath44 tev we obtain @xmath56    the ratio of the energy density in right - handed neutrinos to the critical density is approximately given by @xmath57 note that if we take typical values @xmath58 , @xmath59 tev then @xmath60 and so one quite easily finds @xmath61 as required for a viable cdm candidate .",
    "note also that because the right handed neutrino has no direct neutral current couplings to quarks , it would not be detected in existing wimp detection experiments sensitive to elastic scattering off of nuclei .",
    "we next consider whether what current phenomenological constraints on lepton number violation imply for this model .",
    "first note that stringent constraint on the parameters @xmath15 can be derived from the new contribution to the muon decay effective lagrangian mediated by @xmath27 .",
    "we find @xmath62 the lagrangian @xmath63 can also lead to the flavor violating process @xmath64 .",
    "using the experimental bound on its branching ratio we find : @xmath65 the above constraints can be satisfied for the @xmath66 and @xmath67 few tev , and are also consistent with limits from neutrinoless double @xmath17-decay experiments , and are thus comparable with the requirements needed to generate neutrino masses and dark matter , as described above .    although the right - handed neutrino is a singlet under the sm gauge group , it may be produced in our model through the scatterings of sm particles and the subsequent decay of @xmath28 .",
    "if the center of mass energy of the next generation linear collider exceeds twice the mass of @xmath28 then these particles would be produced in , for example , @xmath68 annihilation . in this case , the dominant decay channel for the @xmath28 particle would be into a charged lepton and the lightest right - handed neutrino , providing a possible collider signature of the model .",
    "it would be particularly exciting if a single mechanism might resolve two of the most important outstanding puzzles in particle physics and cosmology : the nature of dark matter , and the origin of neutrino masses . as we demonstrate here , it is possible to extend standard model of particle physics in a way so that both puzzles may find a common resolution .",
    "the symmetry structure of our model is such that neutrino masses occur only at three - loop level , and so are naturally small . as a consequence , the right - handed neutrino is not constrained to be have a large mass , as in other examples of neutrino mass generation , such as the seesaw model .",
    "such a light right - handed neutrino is a possible weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) dark matter candidate .",
    "we have explored the experimental constraints on our model and it currently passes all standard model tests .",
    "more exciting perhaps is the fact that the tev - scale scale energies required should be accessible at colliders in the near future .",
    "the model may also be tested by future neutrinoless double @xmath17-decay experiments .",
    "a new sort of direct detection wimp technology would be required to directly detect the dark matter candidate we propose .",
