    "gravitational lensing has become a useful tool in measuring certain properties of gravitational fields ever since the beginnings of general relativity . while the initial observations of gravitational lensing were used to verify the theoretical predictions of general relativity , it has now been employed to study the large scale structure of the universe , to determine behaviour of compact stellar objects and to search for dark matter candidates . in what follows",
    "we propose the idea that gravitational lensing might also be used to determine which among various gravitational theories is correct .",
    "it is already well known that the predictions of bending angles computed from newtonian gravity compared to those obtained from einstein s gravity differ by a factor of two . therefore using gravitational lensing a means for exploring the differences between competing gravitational theories",
    "may well provide a technique that can be employed to determine the dimensionality of spacetime , or the coupling of matter and fields to the gravitational field or even to distinguishing among different formulations of gravity theories .    in general the path taken by photons in a gravitational field provide a number of different effects that can be measured using current state - of - the - art telescopes",
    "the first and most obvious one is the production of multiple images and the relative separation of those images .",
    "secondly gravitational lensing can produce a change in brightness of the images depending on how much bending a group of initially parallel rays undergoes .",
    "finally if the source or lensing object has a time dependency , the changes in arrival times of light signals can provide a very accurate measurement of some spacetime properties .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the formation of images ( i.e. their location and brightness ) for some black holes that are predicted to exist in 5-dimensional brane - world theories . by computing the bending angles and image brightness changes that can occur due to the passage of photons past the objects described by black hole solutions of the theory",
    ", we should be able to determine enough of the properties of the lensing object to distinguish a general relativistic black hole from that predicted by an alternative theory .",
    "brane - world models have standard - model matter confined to a 3 + 1 dimensional hypersurface , and gravity acting in a higher - dimensional non - compact space - time .",
    "such models have attracted much attention in recent years , both as candidate theories meant to solve the hierarchy problem and predicting modified cosmological evolution @xcite .",
    "higher codimension branes were considered in connection with conical singularities @xcite , derham . for a codimension - one brane - world , matter is generated on the brane by the junction conditions though the brane representing a discontinuity in the extrinsic curvature @xcite- varbranetensionprd .",
    "although the early expectation to replace dark energy was not met , codimension - one brane - worlds still can produce alternative explanations for dark matter @xcite-@xcite .",
    "therefore the study of localized matter configurations , in particular black hole solutions admitted in brane - world theories became important .",
    "analytic black hole solutions include six - dimensional locally schwarzschild solutions @xcite ; static five - dimensional black holes localized on the brane , with the horizon decaying in the extra dimension and generated by energy condition violating shells @xcite , kantiolasagastitamvakis ; and black holes with a radiating component in the extra dimension @xcite .",
    "numerically small brane black holes ( compared to the five - dimensional curvature ) were shown to exist as five - dimensional schwarzschild solutions @xcite in asymptotically five - dimensional anti de sitter space - time .",
    "the four - dimensional schwarzschild metric can be also extended into the fifth dimension as a black string @xcite , which due to the gregory - laflamme instability @xcite can pinch off , leading to a black cigar metric @xcite ( although under very mild assumptions , classical event horizons will not pinch off @xcite ) .",
    "gravity wave perturbations of such a black - string brane - world were computed in ref .",
    "scmlet .    the perturbative analysis of the gravitational field of a spherically symmetric source in the weak field limit in the original randall - sundrum setup ( schwarzschild black hole on a brane embedded in anti de sitter five - dimensional space - time ) has shown corrections to the schwarzschild potential scaling as @xmath0 @xcite , @xcite and giddings .",
    "however if the schwarzschild black hole is embedded in another higher - dimensional space - time , this scaling would not apply blackstring .",
    "both weak @xcite , @xcite and strong @xcite gravitational lensing of various brane black holes were discussed , the topic being reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the effective einstein equation on the codimension - one brane admits a spherically symmetric vacuum solution characterized by two parameters : the mass @xmath1 and a tidal charge @xmath2 , the latter arising from the weyl curvature of the 5-dimensional space - time in which the brane is embedded @xcite:@xmath3for @xmath4 this represents a black hole with horizons given by @xmath5 . for @xmath6",
    "only @xmath7  is positive , therefore there is only one horizon . for @xmath8",
    "the line element describes the schwarzschild metric and for @xmath9 it is formally identical to the general relativistic reissner - nordstrm electro - vacuum solution with electric charge @xmath10 . in the limit @xmath11",
    "the metric becomes extremal , such that the two horizons coincide .",
    "for @xmath12 there is no horizon at all .",
    "the metric is singular at @xmath13 , thus it describes a naked singularity .",
    "it should be noted that a negative tidal charge strengthens gravity ( the horizon is outside the schwarzschild radius @xmath14 ) , such that @xmath6 contributes to the localization of gravity on the brane .",
    "a positive tidal charge weakens gravity , both horizons lying below the schwarzschild radius for @xmath9 , and obstructing the apparition of a horizon at all for @xmath12 .",
    "observations on light deflection could in principle constrain both the lensing black hole parameters and the underlying gravitational theory .",
    "the lensing properties of a schwarzschild geometry were thoroughly investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite .",
    "recently in ref .",
    "@xcite the deflection angle of light rays passing near the tidal - charged brane black hole was computed up to the second order in the perturbation theory .",
    "the hamiltonian method gave identical results to the previously employed lagrangian method @xcite .",
    "the light deflection was derived in terms of the small parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "here @xmath17  is the impact parameter , defined as the distance of the lensing object to the straight line trajectory , which would occur in the absence of the lensing object .",
    "the deflection angle to second order accuracy is @xmath18a first confrontation with solar system measurements in refs .",
    "tidaldeflection , @xcite led to constraints on @xmath2 and on the brane tension @xmath19 .    further exploring the consequences of the result ( [ delta ] ) , in the present paper we study the formation of images and their magnification factors in the tidal charged black hole geometry , focusing on the similarities and differences with the purely general relativistic case .",
    "in the case of weak lensing where the latter black hole solutions differ from standard general relativistic black holes , we are able to develop a perturbative computation of the bending angles and image brightnesses that can be expected when the black hole masses produce the dominant effect .",
    "however the restriction to objects with weak tidal charge ( compared to mass ) is not necessary .",
    "as long as the impact parameter or distance of closest approach for the light ray remains large compared to a natural length scale associated with the tidal charge , the weak field limit is maintained and tidally charged black hole light bending effects can also be computed .    in section 2",
    "we study the weak lensing under quite generic circumstances .",
    "we derive a lens equation for weak lensing , which will allow for a study of the lensing and image formation to second order accuracy in the chosen small parameters .",
    "this lens equation is more generic than , and reduces to , the virbhadra - ellis equation @xcite-@xcite in a properly defined approximation .",
    "we give the explicit form of both lens equations applied to the tidal charged black hole in the appendix , in order to see at which order the differences arise .    in section 3",
    "we employ the deflection angle ( [ delta ] ) in our lens equation and obtain an approximate equation for weak lensing of the tidal charged black hole in a form of a cubic polynomial . for later comparison",
    "we also review here the lensing by schwarzschild black holes , which arises in our formalism to first order when the mass parameter dominates over the tidal charge parameter .    in section 4",
    "we discuss the corrections in the location of the images and magnification factors , by including the contributions quadratic in the mass parameter and linear in the tidal charge parameter .",
    "this analysis leads to results that are similar to the general relativistic reissner - nordstrm black hole lensing , some of them discussed in ref .",
    "despite @xmath2 being similar to the square of the electric charge of the reissner - nordstrm black hole , the case of a negative tidal charge is without counterpart in general relativity .",
    "section 5 contains the analysis of the case , where the tidal charge dominates over the mass , by keeping only the first order tidal charge contribution .",
    "we determine the image locations and the magnification factors . in section 6",
    "we discuss the second order corrections to the above case , by including contributions linear in the mass and quadratic in the tidal charge .",
    "we summarize our findings in the concluding remarks .",
    "our choice of units is given by @xmath20 .",
    "in the lensing geometry the line connecting the lensing object ( @xmath21 ) and the observer ( @xmath22 ) defines the optical axis .",

    "this quantity vanishes if s , l and o are collinear ( @xmath61 ) and l is midway between s and o. it is therefore expected , that the predictions of the more exact lens equation ( [ le ] ) will differ from the predictions of eq .",
    "( [ lens_ellis ] ) in asymmetric setups of s and o with respect to l.    since we are interested in possibly higher order contributions , characterizing the lensing by tidal charged brane black holes and naked singularities with tidal charge , we need to improve the level of approximation employed in eq .",

    "we have also adopted the convention @xmath84 as this will turn useful in the discussion of the second - order effects .",
    "the lens equation ( [ le ] ) presented here is obtained solely from the geometry of the paths taken by both the deflected and undeflected light rays .",
    "it relates the angles @xmath85 and @xmath64 to each other through the relations among the trigonometric functions of those angles .",
    "the lens equation in this form does not care whether the lensing carried out by an optical instrument or a gravitational lens .",
    "when the bending is due to gravitational effects , the deflection angle @xmath86 ( characterizing the strength of the bending ) can be derived from the null geodesic equations . for weak lensing , the deflection angle can be computed using a set of expansion parameters that characterize the geometry of the black hole spacetime . in the cases studied in this paper",
    "we use the mass and tidal charge divided by a characteristic length scale .",
    "the lens equation can then be applied along with an expression for the bending angle @xmath87 to obtain the image locations @xmath88 given a source position @xmath89 .",
    "the issue that arises is to ensure that the accuracy of the lens equation matches the level of accuracy of the approximation in the deflection angle .",
    "if the lens equation is accurate only to linear order in the angles and the deflection angle is good to third order in the expansion parameters , then there is a loss of accuracy in the former that no longer makes it suitable for higher order computations .",
    "if this is not properly taken into account , errors will arise . on the other hand two different expressions for the lens equations can lead to indistinguishable results",
    "if they agree to within the same order of approximation .",
    "in order to find the position of the images , first the expansion ( [ delta ] ) of the deflection angle @xmath64 should be inserted in the lens equation ( [ le ] ) , secondly the approximations following from the weak lensing approach are carried out .",

    "indeed , @xmath203 , thus @xmath204 and @xmath205 for @xmath206 ( this being in perfect analogy with the behaviour of the schwarzschild images @xmath142 in the @xmath207 limit ) ; while @xmath208 and @xmath209 for @xmath210 .      for negative tidal charge we obtained two images , @xmath179 appearing above the optical axis , and ( depending on the magnitude of the tidal charge ) either @xmath184 or @xmath198 , appearing below the optical axis .",

    "the schwarzschild case is that for a fixed value of the image separation , the magnification factors are significantly increased in the former .",
    "unfortunately a measurement of the individual magnification factors requires a knowledge of the unlensed source brightness .",
    "however if the images can be resolved to obtain their angular separation and individual brightnesses one can compare the ratio of the magnification factors as a function of the image separation normalized to the einstein angle for the system .",
    "this has the advantage of not having to refer to the unlensed source brightness and normalizes the image separation using the characteristic lensing parameters .",
    "figure [ magsep ] plots the logarithm of the ratio of the primary magnification to the secondary magnification as a function of the logarithm of the image separation divided by the einstein angle . for image separations",
    "greater than about 2.5 times the einstein angle , the ratio of the magnification factors for each image obeys a power law relationship .",
    "since this leads to an independence of scaling , we suggest that observations of image brightnesses and image separations should be able to distinguish easily between the standard schwarzschild spacetime and that governed by higher - dimensional weyl curvature effects that induce the tidal charge . given that the magnification of the secondary image produced by the schwarzschild lens is significantly reduced , the ratio @xmath260 is much larger than that for the tidally charged lens .",
    "thus for large image separations one has the relation : @xmath261^{\\kappa } \\]]in the case of schwarzschild lensing @xmath262 whereas for the tidally charged black hole lensing one obtains @xmath263 , which gives two completely different power law behaviours .",
    "therefore given a large enough number of measurements of image separations and image brightnesses ( as well as a knowledge of the characteristics of the lensing object ) such a relationship should provide a very good observational signature that might distinguish between the lensing behaviour by the two types of black holes .",
    "-subscript.,width=377 ]    in fig [ mag3 ] we have represented the image separations @xmath264 , magnification factors @xmath265 and flux ratios @xmath266 for a positive tidal charge as function of @xmath267 . as the allowed positive tidal charged parameter range is @xmath268 ( thus @xmath269 ) , the range of the variable @xmath270 is restricted to @xmath271 .",
    "this is very similar to the negative mass schwarzschild lensing , also shown on fig mag3 .",
    "in this section we follow the method presented in section [ 2o_m ] for obtaining the second order correction to the tidal charge dominated light deflection .",

    "the predictions of our lens equation ( [ le ] ) and of the virbhadra - ellis lens equation ( [ lens_ellis ] ) coincide in most of the cases we consider , with the notable exception of the tidal charge dominated black hole lensing discussed to a higher accuracy in section [ 2o_q ] , where the virbhadra - ellis lens equation would not predict ( or would predict with different coefficients ) some of the higher order terms .",
    "although solar system tests lead to the expected result , that light deflection by the sun is due to its mass , and leaves room but for a minuscule tidal charge @xcite , @xcite , it can not be excluded that tidal charge dominated black holes could exist on the brane , as the tidal charge is an imprint of the weyl curvature of the higher - dimensional space - time , which remains unspecified for the tidal charged black hole .    in the case of mass",

    "when the tidal charge dominates in the lensing behaviour , the situation is different .",
    "the case of positive tidal charge resembles the lensing properties of a negative mass schwarzschild spacetime @xcite .",
    "black holes with negative tidal charge are however favoured by strengthening and confining gravity to the brane and also by thermodynamic considerations @xcite . in the case of a dominant negative tidal charge",
    "the lensing properties are similar to those of a positive mass schwarzschild black hole , where the similarity is only in the number of images lying above or below the optical axis .",
    "the actual location of the images is different and this fact is summarized in fig [ fig3 ] , which is one of the main results of this paper .",
    "finally the power law dependence of the ratio of the magnification factors on the separation of the images provides an means for observing the differences between the schwarzschild and tidal charged black holes . given that the next generation of radio telescopes will easily be able to resolve images to less than milli - arcsecond accuracy , the different rates at which the ratio of the brightness changes should be able to provide a significant observational signature to constrain the weyl curvature as a substitute for dark matter .",
