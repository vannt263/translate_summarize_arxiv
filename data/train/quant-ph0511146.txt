    "new physical models for quantum information processing and quantum computation have been inspired recently by the experimental achievements in trapping and controlling ultracold neutral atoms @xcite .",
    "the first experimental step to achieve a physical realization of a quantum computer with neutral atoms is to confine them on a definite region in the space .",
    "the creation of microscopic guides and traps for neutral atoms moving close to surfaces is possible using nanofabricated structures that either carry currents or are based on permanent magnetized films .",
    "the idea at the base of atom chips has been put forward by frisch and segr @xcite who realized that , when a homogeneous magnetic field ( bias field ) is superimposed with the field created by a current flowing through a wire , the magnetic field vanishes on a line parallel to the current which can trap atoms in low - field seeking magnetic hyperfine sublevels .",
    "one of the main requirements for a qubit is to be well isolated from a noisy environment to avoid decoherence , namely the destruction of quantum superpositions due to the coupling of the atom cloud to the noisy chip environment .",
    "although neutral atoms are considered good candidates as quantum systems since they have a small coupling to the environment , they still suffer from loss and decoherence .",
    "when atoms are trapped in atom chips , they are held close to the material surfaces .",
    "the small separation between the cold atom cloud and the macroscopic environment ( usually at room temperature ) raises the question of how strong the energy exchange will be , and which limit of atom confinement and height above the surface can ultimately be reached .",
    "thermal fluctuations induce noise currents @xcite in the materials the trap is made of , and fluctuations of the electromagnetic field are produced in the conducting body .",
    "such fluctuating fields can be strong enough for an atom close to the surface to drive rf magnetic dipole transitions that flip its spin causing either its loss or decoherence of its quantum state .    in , atom loss due to",
    "thermally driven spin flips has been widely investigated and several experiments have confirmed the theoretical findings @xcite . in this article",
    "we examine the influence of thermally - induced spin flips on the coherence properties of atomic spatial superposition states .",
    "such coherent superpositions can be thought of being created by tunneling through a shallow potential barrier in either a double - well potential or , more generally , an optical lattice structure @xcite .",
    "the study of the latter has been received much attention over the recent years for its potential application in quantum information processing ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the derivation is carried out within the framework of the quantum electrodynamic theory for electromagnetic fields in dielectric media @xcite which yields a first - principle description of the decoherence properties of spatial atomic superposition states .",
    "this work is organized as follows : sec .",
    "ii introduces the basic notions of a quantized electromagnetic field in a dielectric medium . in sec .",
    "iii the density matrix of the atom is obtained in the presence of a fluctuating magnetic field and an expression for the spatial coherence is derived .",
    "we focus on a particular substrate geometry , a planarly multilayered structured , in sec .",
    "[ sec : planar ] , for which the dyadic green function is explicitly known .",
    "it is well known that the quantum statistical properties of electromagnetic fields and their interactions with atomic systems can be strongly influenced by the presence of dielectric bodies . in the present context",
    "it is useful to formulate quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) on a dielectric - matter background @xcite .",
    "the interaction between atomic systems and the electromagnetic field is typically treated in terms of the polarization and magnetization associated with the atomic charges .",
    "let us restrict our attention to an isotropic but arbitrarily inhomogeneous medium whose polarization responds linearly and locally to the electric field .",
    "causality and the dissipation - fluctuation theorem @xcite then require that @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the dielectric susceptibility ( in the time domain ) and @xmath2 is the noise polarization associated with dissipative processes in the dielectric medium .    using maxwell s equations in fourier space , we find that @xmath3 obeys the helmholtz equation @xmath4 where the complex permittivity , @xmath5 , is defined by @xmath6 the solution to eq .",

    "first , a factor is split off from the ( classical ) noise polarization , @xmath12 one then identifies the dynamical variables @xmath13 as the fundamental @xmath14 correlated gaussian random process and , upon quantization , replaces them by the operator - valued bosonic vector field @xmath15 satisfying the equal - time commutation relations @xmath16 $ ] @xmath17 @xmath18 .",

    "in fact , it has been shown in @xcite that the equal - time basic commutation relations of qed are preserved .",
    "the electromagnetic field is expressed in terms of the classical green tensor satisfying the helmholtz equation ( [ helmholtzeq ] ) , and the continuum of the bosonic field variables @xmath15 .",
    "all the information about the dielectric matter is contained in the green tensor via the permittivity @xmath27 . for metals at low frequencies ,",
    "the permittivity can be approximated by the well - known drude relation @xmath28 with the skin depth @xmath14 .",
    "although such a relation is not strictly consistent with causality as it has recently been pointed out @xcite , it can be assumed to be valid in a restricted frequency interval .    at this point",
    "it is necessary to point out the limitations of the quantization scheme presented above .",
    "note that the form of the polarization , eq .",
    "( [ polarization ] ) , is valid only for strictly locally responding materials .",
    "that is to say , we assume that the elementary dipoles that give rise to the polarization are essentially fixed in space .",
    "certainly , for metals which can alternatively described by a conductivity , this is not true as charge carriers can move around freely for considerable distances .",
    "however , the locality assumption can be upheld in situations in which the mean free path length is much shorter than all the other length scales in the system under consideration . while this is certainly true for ordinary metals at room temperature and geometric length scales of several micrometers , we do expect corrections due to spatially nonlocal response ( the anomalous skin effect ) for metals or superconductors at very low temperatures as considered in @xcite .",
    "let us suppose we had an atom in one of two adjacent sites of an optical lattice .",
    "the tunneling interaction allows the atom s wave function to coherently spread over the neighboring site @xcite where its state can be written in the occupation - number basis as @xmath29 we take the time at which the equal superposition has been established to be @xmath30 and assume for simplicity that no tunneling occurs at later times , at least not at timescales shorter than the decoherence time .",
    "this means that we imagine the tunneling interaction being frozen over a certain time period .",
    "this assumption is justified when considering proposals in which spatial atomic locations are used to encode quantum information .",
    "atoms that are held close to microstructured surfaces experience fluctuations of the electromagnetic field due to absorption in the substrate material . in the case of a magnetic trap",
    "the atom is subject to a constant magnetic field with strength @xmath31 in the center of the trap .",
    "the magnetic sublevels are split due to the zeeman effect by the larmor frequency @xmath32 .",
    "a subset of these magnetic sublevels feel an attractive potential towards regions of low magnetic field . in the experiment reported in @xcite @xmath33rb atoms",
    "are initially pumped into the hyperfine state @xmath34 in which they are trapped . however , due to absorption in the surface material and the resulting quantum fluctuations , fluctuating magnetic fields cause the atoms to evolve into states with lower magnetic quantum number @xmath35 . in sufficiently tight magnetic traps , also atoms in the @xmath36 state are trapped .",
    "spin flips to even lower magnetic sublevels cause the atoms to be expelled from the trap . in this case ,",
    "spatial decoherence is no more a matter of interest .",
    "hence , it is sufficient to treat the atomic system in a two - level approximation .",

    "they can be tuned in order to fall within a given tolerance rate for the degree of decoherence .",

    "the two ( double - sided transverse ) scattering parts @xmath175 and @xmath176 have to be introduced to satisfy the boundary conditions for the electromagnetic fields at the interface and describe the reflection and transmission parts of the total scattering green function , respectively .",
