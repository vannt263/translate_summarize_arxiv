    "transverse single - spin asymmetries ( tssas ) , denoted @xmath0 , have been a fundamental observable since the mid-1970s to test perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) .",
    "such measurements were first conducted at fermilab , where large effects were found in @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "these results contradicted the nave collinear parton model , which said that @xmath0 should be extremely small  @xcite , and doubts were raised as to whether pqcd can actually describe these reactions  @xcite .",
    "however , in the 1980s it was shown that if one went beyond the parton model and included collinear twist-3 ( ct3 ) quark - gluon - quark correlations in the nucleon , substantial tssas could be generated  @xcite . in the 1990s",
    "this ct3 approach was worked out in more detail for proton - proton collisions , first for direct photon production  @xcite and then for pion production @xcite . over the last decade ,",
    "several other analyses furthered the development of this formalism  see @xcite and references therein . during the same time",
    ", another mechanism was also put forth to explain tssas in proton - proton collisions .",
    "this approach involves the sivers  @xcite , collins  @xcite , and boer - mulders  @xcite transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) functions and became known as the generalized parton model ( gpm )  see  @xcite and references therein .",
    "( we mention that , since most likely a rigorous factorization formula involving tmd functions does not hold for single - inclusive processes ( which have only one scale ) , the gpm can only be considered a phenomenological model . ) in addition to all of this theoretical work , many experimental measurements of @xmath0 have been performed at proton-(anti)proton accelerators  @xcite .",
    "most of the experimental data in the more negative @xmath2 region , where @xmath3 is the momentum of the outgoing particle , and the transversely polarized proton moves along the @xmath4-axis .",
    "that is , @xmath5 means large momentum fractions @xmath6 of the parton probed inside the transversely polarized proton .",
    "this setup causes @xmath2 to be opposite in sign to the one used in collider experiments ( like those at rhic ) .",
    "] has come in the form of light - hadron asymmetries @xmath7 , e.g. , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , with the exception of the jet asymmetry @xmath11 measured a few years ago at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) by the a@xmath12dy collaboration  @xcite .",
    "plans are also in place to measure the direct photon asymmetry @xmath13 at rhic by both the phenix collaboration and the star collaboration @xcite .",
    "although much progress has been made in understanding tssas , there is not a definitive answer on what their origin might be . in the ct3 approach",
    "it was assumed for many years that a soft - gluon pole ( sgp ) chiral - even quark - gluon - quark ( @xmath14 ) matrix element called the qiu - sterman ( qs ) function @xmath15 was the main cause of @xmath16  @xcite . however , this led to a so - called `` sign mismatch '' between the qs function and the tmd sivers function @xmath17 extracted from semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scattering ( sidis )  @xcite .",
    "this issue could not be resolved through more flexible parameterizations of the sivers function  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite argued , by looking at @xmath0 data on the target tssa in inclusive dis  @xcite , that @xmath15 can not be the main source of @xmath16 .",
    "this observation led us last year in ref .",
    "@xcite to analyze @xmath16 by including not only the qs function but also the fragmentation mechanism , whose analytical formula was first fully derived in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite for fragmentation terms in other processes ) .",
    "we found in this situation for the first time in pqcd that one can fit all rhic high transverse momentum pion data very well without any sign - mismatch issue .",
    "furthermore , we showed that a simultaneous description of tssas in @xmath18 , sidis , and @xmath19 is possible .",
    "nevertheless , more work must be done to confirm / refute this explanation and its predictions .",
    "we mention that in the gpm , one can not draw a definitive conclusion as to whether the sivers or collins mechanism is the main cause of @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "this is due to the theoretical error bands being too large , since the associated tmd functions are mostly unconstrained in the large-@xmath6 regime covered by the data  @xcite . for a detailed discussion of the gpm formalism and its predictions for the after experiment ,",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in addition , in order to have a complete knowledge of tssas , it is important to have a `` clean '' extraction of the qs function from observables like @xmath11 and @xmath13 that do not have any fragmentation contributions .",
    "( for recent analyses of @xmath13 in @xmath20 collisions , see refs .",
    "this is necessary in order to help resolve the sign - mismatch issue and better understand the role of re - scattering effects in the nucleon .",
    "the jet asymmetry has been studied in  @xcite and the direct photon asymmetry has been investigated in  @xcite .",
    "it is important to point out that other contributions to @xmath11 and @xmath13 exist besides the one from the ( sgp @xmath14 chiral - even ) qs function .",
    "these other pieces include ( i ) soft - fermion pole ( sfp ) chiral - even @xmath14 functions , ( ii ) sgp and sfp @xmath14 chiral - odd functions , and ( iii ) sgp tri - gluon functions .",
    "for @xmath13 the numerical analyses in  @xcite show ( i ) is negligible for @xmath21 while the study in  @xcite draws a similar conclusion for ( ii ) as does the work in  @xcite for ( iii ) .",
    "that is , for @xmath13 the qs function dominates the asymmetry .",
    "we mention that at present in the gpm , @xmath13 is predicted to have the _ opposite sign _ to that from the ct3 approach  @xcite .",
    "therefore , as was emphasized in  @xcite , this observable could allow us for the first time to clearly distinguish between the two frameworks as well as learn about the process dependence of the sivers function  @xcite , which is a feature of this non - perturbative object that is crucial to our current understanding of tmd functions .",
    "for @xmath11 the conclusions as to which piece dominates are not as clear .",
    "the study in  @xcite provides evidence that ( ii ) should be small in the whole @xmath2-region .",
    "the work in  @xcite shows the same is most likely true for ( i ) , but that analysis suffers from the sign - mismatch issue .",
    "also , in  @xcite there is an indication that ( iii ) could be significant .",
    "therefore , it will be necessary to re - assess the impact of ( i ) and ( iii ) on @xmath11 . nevertheless , one can gain insight into these other terms by looking at the contribution from the qs function and comparing it with data .",
    "given the open issues that still remain , it is an opportune time for the large hadron collider ( lhc ) to produce data on tssas in proton - proton collisions via the after experiment .",
    "these measurements will not only add to the data from fermilab , ags , and rhic , but also , through the high luminosity of the experiment  @xcite , probe certain features that remain ambiguous . for example , the behavior of @xmath16 at large pion transverse momentum @xmath22 appears to fall off very slowly ( or is even flat ) , a feature which theory says should persist to high @xmath22  @xcite ( see also  @xcite in the context of @xmath23 production ) .",
    "however , the data from rhic  @xcite has too large error bars ( or not enough statistics ) in this high-@xmath22 region to ascertain whether or not this is true .",
    "also , @xmath11 measured by a@xmath12dy  @xcite has large error bars as @xmath2 becomes more negative , which makes it difficult to determine whether or not the qs function alone can describe that data .",
    "moreover , as previously mentioned , @xmath13 has never been measured before , yet it could be a tremendous opportunity to learn about the process dependence of the sivers function and distinguish between the ct3 and gpm frameworks .",
    "already , phenix and star plan to carry out such experiments  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this paper we give predictions within the ct3 formalism for @xmath16 , @xmath11 , and @xmath13 at after@lhc kinematics .",
    "( for related work on charmonium and bottomonium production we refer to @xcite . ) since the relevant analytical formulas already exist within the literature , in sec .",
    "[ s : phen ] we focus on the phenomenology and refer the reader to the appropriate papers on the underlying theory .",
    "these numerical results are summarized in sec .  [",
    "s : sum ] , and there we highlight again how after can offer unique insight into tssas in proton - proton collisions , which is a truly fundamental observable to test pqcd at higher twist .",
    "we start first with @xmath16 , where we follow our numerical work in ref .",
    "( we also refer the reader to  @xcite for more formal discussions of the relevant analytical formulas . )",
    "there we took into account the contribution from the qs function and the fragmentation term .",
    "the former has a model - independent relation to the sivers function  @xcite while the latter involves three non - perturbative ct3 fragmentation functions ( ffs ) :  @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "of these , @xmath24 has a model - independent connection to the collins function  @xcite , and @xmath26 can be written in terms of the other two through a qcd equation - of - motion relation  @xcite . in figs .",
    "[ f : an_xf_pi],@xmath27[f : an_pt_pi ] we provide predictions for neutral and charged pion production at after based on our fit in  @xcite .",
    "one sees in fig .",
    "[ f : an_xf_pi ] from @xmath16 vs.  @xmath2 that the magnitude of the asymmetry can be anywhere from @xmath28 , and from @xmath16 vs.  @xmath29 that it increases with more negative ( center - of - mass ) rapidity @xmath29 . , @xmath29 , and @xmath22 : @xmath30",
    ", so @xmath0 vs.  @xmath2 ( @xmath0 vs.  @xmath29 ) at fixed @xmath29 ( @xmath22 ) implies a running in @xmath22 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "] one also notices that @xmath16 turns over at more negative @xmath2 values , which was also observed in some of the star data  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ f : an_pt_pi ] , where we show @xmath16 vs.  @xmath22 , one sees that the asymmetry is flat or falls off very slowly as @xmath22 increases , a feature that had also been measured by star  @xcite",
    ". it will be important to establish with more precision if this flatness persists at higher-@xmath22 values , say @xmath31 , and after , with its much higher luminosity , will be in a position to make such a measurement",
    ".    we next look at @xmath11 and @xmath13 , which do not receive contributions from ffs . as we discussed in sec .",
    "[ s : intro ] , the former may receive non - negligible contributions from terms other than the qs function , while for the latter we recently showed in  @xcite that the qs function is the dominant piece to that asymmetry .",
    "( all of the analytical expressions for @xmath13 can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , while those for @xmath11 are determined simply by setting @xmath32 ( the unpolarized ff ) to @xmath33 in the equations for @xmath16 given in  @xcite . )",
    "however , given that the other pieces for @xmath11 are not reliably known , for that asymmetry we will only look at the contribution from the qs function using its relation to the sivers function , while for @xmath13 we adopt our work in  @xcite . in figs .",
    "[ f : an_xf_jg ] , [ f : an_pt_jg ] we show results for jet and photon production at after .",
    "we see that @xmath11 is very small , although we caution the reader that the sivers function ( which we use as input for the qs function ) is mostly unconstrained in the large-@xmath6 region , and when this uncertainty is taken into account , one could obtain a measurable asymmetry  @xcite . also , as we mentioned , there is the potential for ( chiral - even ) sfp and/or tri - gluon functions to make an impact .",
    "therefore , in order to determine if the sivers function alone can describe @xmath11 , along with the current data from a@xmath12dy , we need more precise data in the far backward region , which should be possible at after .    unlike the jet asymmetry , @xmath13 could be on the order of @xmath34 at less negative @xmath2 and more negative @xmath29 ( see fig .  [",
    "f : an_xf_jg ] ( top ) ) or smaller @xmath22 and less negative @xmath2 ( see fig .  [",
    "f : an_pt_jg ] ) .",
    "both of these observations are consistent with the behavior of @xmath13 as a function of rapidity ( see fig .  [",
    "f : an_xf_jg ] ( bottom ) ) , where the asymmetry peaks at @xmath35 ( with @xmath36 ) , which corresponds to @xmath37 .",
    "since the qs function is the dominant source of the asymmetry , we can have `` clean '' access to it .",
    "we state again that the gpm framework at present predicts @xmath13 to be _ positive _",
    "therefore , a clear nonzero signal for this observable would help to distinguish between the ct3 and gpm formalisms .",
    "however , we emphasize that should data contradict the predictions of the gpm , this does not invalidate the results obtained for tmd observables that are based on rigorous tmd factorization proofs .",
    "also , since we use the sivers function from sidis as our input for the qs function , we can learn about the predicted process dependence of the sivers function .",
    "in this paper we have discussed tssas in single - inclusive pion , jet , and photon production from proton - proton collisions , i.e. , @xmath38 , at kinematics relevant for the proposed after@lhc experiment .",
    "these asymmetries have been fundamental observables to test pqcd at higher twist for close to 40 years , and much work has been performed on both the theoretical and experimental sides .",
    "nevertheless , issues still remain as to the origin of these tssas , which makes a measurement of @xmath0 at the lhc via the after experiment timely .",
    "for @xmath16 we have found that after should expect ( absolute ) asymmetries on the order of @xmath39 as a function of @xmath2 and increasing as the rapidity becomes more negative .",
    "also , the @xmath22 dependence of @xmath16 still falls off slowly and flattens out at high @xmath22 .",
    "for @xmath11 we predict a very small asymmetry , but we must remember that uncertainties in the sivers function could allow for a measurable observable  @xcite and also that other contributions ( like chiral - even sfp and tri - gluon ) could make an impact .",
    "lastly , for @xmath13 we expect asymmetries on the order of @xmath40 and decreasing with more negative @xmath2 and increasing @xmath22",
    ". these are opposite in sign to the ones predicted from the gpm  @xcite .    even though these observables have been ( or are planned to be ) measured at rhic , after has the ability , through its much higher luminosity , to not just supplement the rhic data , but also provide important information on still unknown issues .",
    "for example , it will be key to determine if @xmath16 stays flat at higher-@xmath22 , say to 12 - 15 gev , like theory predicts  @xcite and star has evidence for  @xcite .",
    "also , higher statistics should allow for more precise measurements of @xmath11 at more negative @xmath2 , which will be necessary to determine if the qs function is the sole source of that asymmetry .",
    "moreover , @xmath13 has never been measured before and provides the opportunity to clearly distinguish between the ct3 and gpm frameworks and learn about the process dependence of the sivers function .",
    "given the questions that remain as to the origin of tssas , which has been unresolved for almost 40 years , after could provide valuable data on these observables .",

    "<S> we present results for transverse single - spin asymmetries in proton - proton collisions at kinematics relevant for after , a proposed fixed - target experiment at the large hadron collider . </S>",
    "<S> these include predictions for pion , jet , and direct photon production from analytical formulas already available in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss specific measurements that will benefit from the higher luminosity of after , which could help resolve an almost 40-year puzzle of what causes transverse single - spin asymmetries in proton - proton collisions . </S>"
