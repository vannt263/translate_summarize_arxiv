    "composed of a neutron star or black hole primary and a low - mass , typically evolved secondary star that donates material to the primary via roche lobe overflow , low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) are the only luminous ( @xmath0 ergs s@xmath1 ) class of x - ray point source expected in significant numbers in the old stellar populations of s0 and elliptical galaxies .",
    "it came as no surprise that _",
    ", with its subarcsecond spatial resolution , was able to resolve dozens if not hundreds of individual lmxbs in nearby early - type galaxies , which in some instances comprise the bulk of the x - ray emission from the galaxy . what was surprising was the discovery that a remarkably high percentage of the lmxbs reside within globular clusters of the host galaxies ( e.g. , angelini , loewenstein , & mushotzky 2001 ; kundu , maccarone , & zepf 2002 ; randall , sarazin , & irwin 2004 ) . also unexpected was the variation in the fraction of lmxbs within globular clusters from galaxy to galaxy , ranging from almost 70% in ngc  1399 to a more modest 18% in ngc  1553 ( angelini et al .",
    "2001 ; sarazin et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "in retrospect , the high fraction of lmxbs within globular clusters should not have been surprising . in the milky way ,",
    "globular clusters host @xmath210% of the galaxy s lmxbs , despite the fact they constitute only @xmath20.1% of the galaxy s mass .",
    "given that early - type galaxies have a higher fraction of their mass in globular clusters than spiral galaxies , early - type galaxies would naturally produce more lmxbs within globular clusters than spiral galaxies of comparable mass , even if both types of galaxies produced similar numbers of field lmxbs .",
    "the high stellar density within globular clusters is undoubtedly responsible for the disproportionately high number of lmxbs within them .",
    "the increased rate of multibody interactions within globular clusters serves to tighten existing binaries to the point that mass transfer from the secondary onto the compact accretor can occur much more frequently than in the field .",
    "the gravitational capture of a potential donor star by a lone neutron star or black hole is also much more likely within a globular cluster than in the field .",
    "given the much higher ( @xmath3 times ) efficiency of creating lmxbs within globular clusters than in the field , it is natural to ask if _ all _ ( or nearly all ) lmxbs are formed within globular clusters .",
    "this was first suggested by grindlay ( 1984 ) for the case of galactic x - ray bursting binaries and extended to lmxbs within early - type galaxies by white , sarazin , & kulkarni ( 2002 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "lmxbs that currently reside in the field originally formed within globular clusters but were subsequently separated from the cluster either by a supernova kick imparted to the system once the primary evolved , through stellar encounters within the globular cluster , or through the tidal disruption / destruction of the the host globular cluster .",
    "many x - ray properties of the field lmxbs appear indistinguishable from the globular cluster lmxbs for the galaxies studied to date , suggesting a common origin of the two populations . both the x - ray luminosity functions ( kundu et al .  2002 ; jordn et al .",
    "2004 ) and bulk spectral properties ( maccarone , kundu , & zepf 2003 ; irwin , athey , & sarazin 2003 ; humphrey & buote 2004 ) of the two populations are consistent with having been drawn from the same parent distribution .",
    "on the other hand , the variation in the fraction of lmxbs in globular clusters from galaxy to galaxy is more easily explained as the sum of a field population of lmxbs that scales with the mass of the galaxy and a globular cluster population of lmxbs that scales with the number of globular clusters , particularly if it can be confirmed that galaxies with a larger number of globular clusters have a higher fraction of their lmxbs within globular clusters than in galaxies with relatively few globular clusters .",
    "indeed , previous studies have noted this trend in a few galaxies ( sarazin et al .",
    "2003 ; maccarone et al .",
    "2003 ) that support this notion .",
    "one potential method of determining whether the present - day field lmxb population originated within globular clusters or are indigenous to the field is to investigate the spatial distribution of the field lmxbs .",
    "if they formed in globular clusters , the lmxbs might be expected to follow the generally flatter spatial distribution of the globular clusters ( e.g. , ashman & zepf 1998 ) , rather than the steeper de vaucouleurs profile of the optical light .",
    "observationally , this is a difficult effect to confirm .",
    "the limited number of field lmxbs in any given observation does not constrain their spatial profile particularly well . furthermore",
    ", hot x - ray gas present in the galaxies will raise the detection limit of sources near the center of the galaxies , leading to an artificial flattening of the spatial distribution of the lmxbs .",
    "in addition , it is not at all clear if the ejected lmxbs will maintain the shape of the parent globular distribution , since different ejection mechanisms will lead to different field lmxb distributions .",
    "if the lmxbs are ejected from globular clusters via supernova kicks , the spatial distribution of the field lmxbs will be more extended , given that the expected kick velocity of several hundred km s@xmath1 is approximately the same as the average space velocity of a globular cluster within a galaxy .",
    "conversely , simulations show that tidal disruption / destruction of globular clusters is more efficient in the central regions of galaxies ( e.g. , vesperini 2000 ) , which would lead to a profile of stripped lmxbs that is steeper than the remaining globular clusters",
    ".    an alternative method of addressing this issue is to compare the total number of lmxbs to the total number of globular clusters in a galaxy for a sample of galaxies .",
    "if all lmxbs formed within globular clusters , there should be a linear relation between these two quantities regardless of where the lmxbs currently reside .",
    "on the other hand , if there is a significant population of lmxbs created in the field , the relation between the number of lmxbs and globular clusters should be weaker , as the field component becomes more dominant in galaxies with fewer globular clusters .",
    "this would also predict that the fraction of lmxbs found within globular clusters is larger for galaxies with more globular clusters per unit light , which could account for the measured spread in the fraction of lmxbs within globular clusters from galaxy to galaxy .    in practice , it is more feasible to determine the total x - ray luminosity emanating from lmxbs rather than the total number , since each observation in general has a different limiting luminosity for source detection .",
    "in addition , it is necessary to normalize both the total lmxb luminosity and the number of globular clusters by the optical light of the galaxy to compare galaxies of different physical sizes .",
    "the latter quantity is usually referred to as the globular cluster specific frequency , and is defined as @xmath4 ( harris & van den bergh 1981 ) , where @xmath5 is the total number of globular clusters in the galaxy and @xmath6 is the absolute visual magnitude of the galaxy .",
    "such a comparison of @xmath7 to @xmath8 for a sample of galaxies was originally performed by white et al .",
    "( 2002 ) using _ advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics ( asca ) _ data , who found a strong correlation between @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "his best - fit relation of @xmath9 was consistent with the hypothesis that all lmxbs were created within globular clusters .",
    "however , the uncertainty of the power - law exponent was large enough that a significant field population of lmxbs could not be excluded .",
    "the poor spatial resolution of _ asca _ did not allow individual lmxbs to be resolved and their luminosities added .",
    "instead , @xmath10 was estimated from performing a two - component spectral fit to simultaneously model the hot gas and lmxb components of the x - ray spectra .",
    "such a method generally leads to large uncertainties in the flux of the lmxb component , especially for galaxies with much hot gas , since @xmath11 fitting will attempt to fit the many soft energy channels at the expense of the fewer hard energy channels that constrain the lmxb component the best .",
    "the ability of _ chandra _ to resolve a large fraction of the lmxb population of early - type galaxies greatly reduces the uncertainties in @xmath10 , which allows better constraints to be put on the @xmath7 versus @xmath8 relation .",
    "kim & fabbiano ( 2004 ) have performed such a study with 14 early - type galaxies observed with _",
    "chandra _ and confirmed the result of white et al .",
    "( 2002 ) of a connection between @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "they did not , however , derive a slope between the two quantities . in this paper",
    ", we analyze the _ chandra _ data for 12 early - type galaxies to determine the exact dependence of @xmath7 on @xmath8 to put constraints on the relative fraction of lmxbs created within globular clusters and in the field .",
    "our method for determining the @xmath7 versus @xmath8 relation differs from previous studies and is presented in detail in   [ sec : method ] .",
    "the inclusion of the high-@xmath8 galaxy ngc  1399 in our sample requires special attention in order to accurately determine its @xmath7 value and is discussed in ",
    "[ sec : ngc1399 ] .",
    "our best - fit @xmath7 versus @xmath8 relation is given in ",
    "[ sec : lxlb ] , and a comparison of the predicted initial fraction of lmxbs within globular to their present - day observed values is given in ",
    "[ sec : fractions ] . finally , we discuss our results in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "our method for determining the dependence of @xmath7 on @xmath8 differs from previous methods in three important ways .",
    "first , we do not assume a simple power - law fit between the two quantities .",
    "if some lmxbs are truly formed in the field , we would expect @xmath7 from these lmxbs to be a constant from galaxy to galaxy ( assuming similar ages and stellar populations of the galaxies ) , while @xmath7 from lmxbs within globular clusters should scale linearly with @xmath8 : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are constants .",
    "figure  [ fig : models ] illustrates the shape of the @xmath7 versus @xmath8 relation for a variety of scenarios . if all lmxbs were created in the field ( case  1 ) , there would be no dependence of @xmath7 on @xmath8 , so @xmath15 and @xmath14 is a positive constant .",
    "conversely , if all lmxbs are formed within globular clusters ( case  2 ) , @xmath7 would vary linearly with @xmath8 , for which @xmath13 is a positive constant and @xmath16 ( i.e. , a galaxy with no globular clusters would not contain any lmxbs ) .",
    "finally , if lmxbs were formed both within globular clusters and the field ( case  3 ) , @xmath13 and @xmath14 would both be positive constants . in this event",
    ", field lmxbs would dominate in low-@xmath8 galaxies , while globular cluster lmxbs would dominate in high-@xmath8 galaxies .",
    "although case  1 has been definitively ruled out by the finding that 20%70% of lmxbs are presently coincident with globular clusters , neither case  2 nor case  3 has been ruled out by previous studies .",
    "note that the difference in the shape of the @xmath7 versus @xmath8 relation between case  2 and case  3 holds even if a significant fraction ( or all , for that matter ) of the lmxbs escaped from globular clusters into the field over the lifetime of the galaxy .",
    "in other words , lmxbs escaping from globular clusters can not make a case  2 scenario look like a case  3 scenario , provided that large numbers of globular clusters are not completely destroyed .",
    "3.10truein    second , it is vitally important to calculate @xmath7 only within the same angular area for which @xmath8 was determined . it is well established that @xmath8 is a strong function of galactic radius , as the integrated @xmath8 determined out to a radius of @xmath17 or more from ground - based observations can be as much as a factor of 5 higher than when determined within the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) field of view ( kundu & whitmore 2001a , b ; kissler - patig 1997 ) . comparing @xmath7 which was determined over the entire _ chandra _ acis - s @xmath18 field of view to , @xmath8 , determined either in the @xmath19 chevron - shaped field of view of the _ hst _ wfpc2 or from large angular ( @xmath20 radius ) area ground - based observations , will undoubtedly lead to erroneous results given the strong dependence of @xmath8 on galactic radius .",
    "third , in determining the total x - ray luminosity from the sum of the sources , we exclude sources more luminous than @xmath21 ergs s@xmath1 .",
    "the few most luminous sources in a typical early - type galaxy generally contribute a significant fraction of the total x - ray luminosity from lmxbs .",
    "thus , the determination of @xmath22 can be greatly affected by random poisson fluctuations in the number of the few most luminous lmxbs , especially for smaller galaxies that are only expected to have two to three sources with @xmath23 ergs s@xmath1 .",
    "in fact , for the sample of galaxies we study here , we find that the fraction of the total flux emanating from @xmath24 ergs s@xmath1 sources ranges anywhere from 0% to 35% .",
    "however , by excluding sources more luminous than @xmath21 ergs s@xmath1 and only including galaxies large enough such that the integrated luminosity from sources below @xmath21 ergs s@xmath1 is at least @xmath25 ergs s@xmath1 , no one source will contribute more than 10% to the total flux , thereby minimizing the effect of an overabundance or deficit of high - luminosity sources on @xmath22 .",
    "we constructed a sample of every normal early - type galaxy that satisfied the following criteria : ( 1 ) it was observed by the _ chandra _",
    "acis - s for at least 10 ks , ( 2 ) the literature @xmath8 value was constrained to at least 50% accuracy and the value of the @xmath26-band luminosity each author used to determine @xmath8 over the reported angular area is stated , ( 3 ) the total lmxb luminosity was at least @xmath27 ergs s@xmath1 ( see above ) , and ( 4 ) it did not contain so much hot gas that determination of the unresolved lmxb emission would be problematic , unless literature @xmath8 values were available in a well - defined angular region outside the core of the galaxy ( such as ngc  1399 below ) . this yielded a total of 12 galaxies , listed in table  [ tab : galaxies ] .    the data for each galaxy were processed in a uniform manner following the _ chandra _ data reduction threads .",
    "the data were calibrated with the most recent gain maps at the time of reduction .",
    "pile - up was not an issue even for the brightest sources and no correction has been applied .",
    "energy channels above 6 kev were ignored , since these channels introduce significantly more noise than source signal .",
    "sources were detected using the  mexican - hat \" wavelet detection routine _ wavdetect _ in ciao in an 0.36.0 kev band image .",
    "we then culled the source list to include only those sources that were detected at the @xmath28 level .",
    "all images created were corrected for exposure and vignetting . for each source",
    "a local background was determined from a circular annular region with an inner radius that was set to 1.5 times the semimajor axis of the source extraction region and an outer radius chosen such that the area of the background annulus was 5 times the area of the sources extraction region .",
    "care was taken to exclude neighboring sources from the background annuli of each source in crowded regions .",
    "for the diffuse emission , background was taken from the same s3 chip well away from the detectable galactic emission .",
    "for our study , we only included sources that fell within the angular area covered by the optical telescope used to determine @xmath8 .",
    "for all galaxies except ngc  1399 , this was the familiar chevron - shaped _ hst _ wfpc2 field of view .",
    "for ngc  1399 , we considered sources within two separate annular rings that were @xmath29 and @xmath30 in extent , for comparison to @xmath8 determined in these annular bins by ostrov , forte , & geisler ( 1998 ) from ground - based observations .",
    "for each source , the 0.36.0 kev count rate was converted into a flux using a @xmath31 power - law model , a value typical of the integrated flux from lmxbs in early - type galaxies ( irwin et al .",
    "unabsorbed fluxes were then determined assuming galactic hydrogen column densities from dickey & lockman ( 1990 ) , and converted to 0.310 kev luminosities assuming surface brightness fluctuation distances of tonry et al .",
    "the luminosities of each of the sources except the central source ( which might be a low - luminosity active galactic nucleus [ agn ] rather than an lmxb ) were summed to yield @xmath32 for each galaxy . to this we added an estimate of the total luminosity of unresolved lmxbs that were either below the detection threshold of the observation or for which crowding at the center of the galaxy precluded their individual detection . to estimate @xmath33",
    ", we tried performing spectral fitting of the diffuse emission to simultaneously model the hot gas ( apec ) and unresolved lmxb ( power - law ) components within xspec , but doing so consistently led to a best - fit model that underestimated the 26 kev flux by 10%-20% .",
    "evidently , complexities in modeling the hot gas ( the effects of temperature gradients and non - solar abundance ratios ) have led the fitting routine to attempt to minimize @xmath11 in the numerous , gas - dominated soft energy channels at the expense of the fewer lmxb - dominated hard energy channels .",
    "we therefore use an alternative method to determine @xmath33 in which we assume that the diffuse emission above a certain energy is not contaminated by emission from the hot gas in these galaxies , leaving unresolved lmxbs as the sole source of the diffuse emission . gas at a temperature of 0.7 kev typically contributes a negligible number of counts above 2 kev given the _",
    "chandra _ response , while gas at 0.3 kev contributes negligibly above 1 kev .",
    "starting with the 36 kev background - subtracted diffuse flux , we estimated the 0.310 kev luminosity of unresolved sources assuming the same @xmath31 power - law model as was assumed for the resolved sources .",
    "we then stepped down the low - energy bound of the diffuse flux determination in 0.5 kev increments until the extrapolation to the 0.310 kev band failed to yield a value consistent with the extrapolation from using higher low energy cut offs ( indicating that hot gas was contributing to the diffuse flux ) and calculated the unresolved lmxb luminosity using a lower energy cut off that was one 0.5 kev increment higher .",
    "this estimate for @xmath33 was added to @xmath32 to yield @xmath34 for all sources in each galaxy . for most of the galaxies in the sample",
    "the resolved source flux represented between 25% to 50% of the total lmxb flux .",
    "the 1  @xmath35 uncertainty in the luminosity was calculated accordingly from the total number of counts for each galaxy and ranged from 7% to 20% .    a fraction ( typically 5% ) of the observed x - ray flux emanates from unrelated foreground / background sources along the line of sight to the galaxy .",
    "using the log @xmath36log @xmath37 relation of mushotzky et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , we have determined the expected number and integrated flux of such sources over the angular area studied , and subtracted this flux from the observed flux .",
    "the foreground / background source - corrected @xmath34 was normalized by the optical light of the galaxy that fell within our angular region of interest .",
    "we used the same @xmath26-band luminosities from the literature that provided the values of @xmath8 .",
    "historically , @xmath7 has been given in terms of the @xmath14-band luminosity ( @xmath38 ) , so for comparison to previous studies , we convert the @xmath26-band luminosities to @xmath14-band using published @xmath39 values .",
    "since all the galaxies in our sample have nearly identical @xmath39 values , the choice to use @xmath14-band luminosities rather than @xmath26-band luminosities has a minimal impact on the results .",
    "since most of the galaxies in our sample have globular cluster specific frequencies at or below 2.0 , the addition of a galaxy with a very high @xmath8 value such as ngc  1399 would considerably improve the constraint on the @xmath38 versus @xmath8 relation .",
    "unfortunately , the hot gas within ngc  1399 is about 1 kev . at this temperature and given the large amount of gas that ngc  1399 contains , the gas is still contributing appreciably to the flux at 3 kev .",
    "in addition , the gaseous flux from ngc  1399 fills the entire s3 chip , making background subtraction problematic . as a result , our method of estimating the unresolved lmxb emission from the amount of diffuse emission in the hard energy band will not work .    an alternative way of estimating the integrated lmxb luminosity from ngc  1399 is to use the fact that the x - ray luminosity functions of the sources within early - type galaxies are fairly regular , at least for sources less luminous than @xmath40 ergs s@xmath1 . from the other galaxies in our sample for which the detection limit was below @xmath41 ergs s@xmath1",
    ", we calculated the fraction of the total integrated flux emanating from sources with luminosities in the range @xmath42 ergs s@xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath43 , and found that @xmath44 was reasonably similar from galaxy to galaxy , ranging from 34% to 48% , with a mean of 41% and a standard deviation of 5% .",
    "we then determined the luminosity from resolved sources in the range @xmath42 ergs s@xmath1 for ngc  1399 and divided this luminosity by @xmath45 to yield the total luminosity from lmxbs in ngc  1399 .",
    "this was done separately for two annular rings @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the detection limit for this observation of ngc  1399 was @xmath46 ergs s@xmath1 , so we can be reasonably assured of detecting all sources above @xmath41 ergs s@xmath1 outside of @xmath47 . for the inner @xmath47",
    "the high x - ray surface brightness of the hot gas precluded the detection of all but the most luminous sources , rendering this technique ineffective for this region .",
    "the @xmath38 versus @xmath8 relation for the galaxies in our sample is shown in figure     [ fig : lxlb ] .",
    "we fit a linear model of the form @xmath48 to the data using a linear regression algorithm that accounts for errors in both quantities ( see fasano & vio 1988 ) . here",
    "@xmath38 is in units of @xmath49 ergs s@xmath1 l@xmath50 . without including the two data points from ngc  1399 , the best - fit coefficients are @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( 1 @xmath35 uncertainties ) .",
    "note that the two data points for ngc  1399 lie near the best - fit relation , indicating that our alternative technique for determining @xmath38 for ngc  1399 is reasonable .",
    "if we include ngc  1399 , the best - fit constants are @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the best - fit relation between @xmath38 and @xmath8 most closely resembles the prediction of case  3 shown in figure  [ fig : models ] . here",
    "@xmath14 differs from 0 at the @xmath55 level and strongly argues that a significant fraction of lmxbs were truly formed in the field , rather than having been formed within globular clusters and later escaped .",
    "if the latter had occurred , we would still expect a linear relation through the origin ( case  2 ) .",
    "3.10truein    one potential cause of bias in a study of this nature stems from the fact that lmxbs are observed to occur in red globular clusters 3 times more often than in blue globular clusters , both within the milky way ( grindlay 1993 ) and in nearby elliptical galaxies ( kundu et al .",
    "2002 ; sarazin et al .",
    "a galaxy with a higher fraction of red globular clusters would create more lmxbs than a galaxy with a lower fraction of red globular clusters , even if both galaxies had the same total number of globular clusters .",
    "this would create scatter in the @xmath38 versus @xmath8 relation that might bias the results drawn from it . to test whether this has affected our results , we determined the fraction of red clusters in each galaxy in our sample , using the @xmath56 histograms of the globular clusters for each galaxy published in the literature ( kundu & whitmore 1998 ; 2001a,2001b ) .",
    "we considered a globular cluster to be blue if its @xmath57 , and red if its @xmath58 ( following kundu et al .",
    "the observed colors were corrected for galactic extinction . for the galaxies in our sample the red fraction of globular clusters varied from 24% to 48% .",
    "previous studies have found that red clusters have a @xmath26% chance of harboring a @xmath59 ergs s@xmath1 lmxb , while blue clusters have a @xmath22% chance .",
    "given these fractions , we found that a galaxy with a red globular cluster fraction of 48% will produce about 30% more lmxbs than a galaxy with a red globular cluster fraction of only 24% , neglecting the presence of field lmxbs .",
    "if field lmxbs are included and are assumed to comprise roughly half of the total lmxbs in a galaxy , the difference in the total number of lmxbs ( and hence @xmath38 ) between the two galaxies diminishes to 15% , or @xmath60 from the mean .",
    "this is on the order of the statistical uncertainties of each galaxy in our sample .",
    "furthermore , the red fraction of globular clusters is uncorrelated with @xmath8 for the galaxies in our sample , eliminating the possibility that this effect introduces any systematic bias to the @xmath38 versus @xmath8 relation .",
    "thus , while a varying fraction of red clusters in a galaxy can introduce some scatter in the @xmath38 versus @xmath8 relation , it is not enough to change the overall results of this study .",
    "another possible source of bias is if a non - negligible fraction of the unresolved hard x - ray flux emanated from a large population of weak x - ray emitters ( i.e. , rs cvn systems , cataclysmic variable , m stars , or some other unknown x - ray emitter ) rather than lmxbs .",
    "if the summed x - ray luminosity of such sources scales linearly with the mass of the galaxy , then this would account for at least part of the derived @xmath61 value that we had assumed to be exclusively from lmxbs , and the removal of such a component from the @xmath38 versus @xmath8 relation would diminish the statistical need for a field - born population of lmxbs ( i.e. , @xmath14 would be lowered and less constrained ) . to investigate this ,",
    "we have analyzed an archival 38 ks _",
    "observation of the bulge of m31 , which we assume can serve as an adequate template for the x - ray population of old stellar populations like those within the galaxies of our sample .",
    "we found that 86% of the 26 kev flux was resolved into point sources with luminosities exceeding @xmath62 ergs s@xmath1 .",
    "thus , if there is a hidden population of weak x - ray emitters within old stellar populations , they contribute less than 14% to the hard x - ray flux , or equivalently , less than 14% of our best - fit @xmath14 value .",
    "it should be noted that a non - zero @xmath63-intercept implies that all or most lmxbs in the field formed in the field only if we assume that a significant number of globular clusters were not destroyed after the ejection of the lmxb ( or if the lmxb survived the process that destroyed the globular cluster ) .",
    "if many globular clusters were destroyed , this would have the effect of reducing @xmath8 while leaving @xmath38 unchanged , shifting the true @xmath38 versus @xmath8 relation to the left .",
    "thus , it might be possible that if all lmxbs were formed within globular clusters ( case  2 ) , the present - day @xmath38 versus @xmath8 relation could resemble case  3 if enough globular clusters were destroyed .",
    "however , this can not be accomplished by simply destroying the same fraction of globular clusters in each galaxy ( dividing the original @xmath8 of each galaxy by a constant ) , as this would still lead to a best - fit relation through the origin which is not seen .",
    "what would be required is that some galaxies have lost a much higher fraction of their globular clusters than other galaxies . from figure",
    "[ fig : lxlb ] , even if we assume that the galaxies with @xmath64 have not lost any globular clusters , it would require that the two lowest @xmath8 galaxies ( ngc  1553 and ngc  3379 ) have lost about two - thirds of their globular clusters ( i.e. , they had an original @xmath8 of @xmath21.5 ) if the original @xmath38 versus @xmath8 relation were to go through the origin .",
    "while the globular cluster destruction rates of vesperini ( 2000 ) predict such a high destruction rate for galaxies less massive than @xmath65 m@xmath66 , ngc  1553 and ngc  3379 have masses approaching @xmath67 m@xmath66 , given their absolute visual magnitudes and a reasonable @xmath68 ratio .",
    "vesperini ( 2000 ) predicts that galaxies of this mass should only lose about 10% of their original globular cluster population .",

    "the non - zero @xmath63-intercept of the @xmath38 versus @xmath8 relation demonstrates that lmxbs are formed within the field , but it does not eliminate the possibility that at least some of the present - day field population was ejected from globular clusters . if some of the present - day field lmxbs actually were created in and later escaped from globular clusters , we would expect the present - day fraction of lmxbs within globular clusters to be smaller than the initial fraction of lmxbs within globular clusters . the latter quantity can be predicted from our @xmath38 versus @xmath8 relation and can be given in terms of the best - fit constants @xmath13 and @xmath14 along with @xmath8 for each galaxy : @xmath72 it is important to keep in mind that nowhere in the determination of the @xmath38 versus @xmath8 relation ( and therefore the determination of the initial fraction of lmxbs within globular clusters ) did we use the knowledge of the _ observed _ ( present - day ) fraction of lmxbs within globular clusters .",
    "thus , the comparison of the initial fraction of lmxbs formed within globular cluster to the present - day observed fraction is not tautological in nature . in table  [ tab : compare ] we compare the initial and measured fractions of lmxbs formed within globular clusters for those galaxies for which such a measurement exists in the literature .",
    "we have also included ngc  4472 and ngc  4649 , 2 galaxies we excluded from our original sample because they contain large amounts of @xmath21 kev gas that prevents an accurate determination of the unresolved lmxb flux .",
    "there is good agreement between the initial and measured fractions of lmxbs within globular clusters for the four elliptical galaxies ( ngc  4472 , ngc  4649 , ngc  4365 , and ngc  1399 ) , where the measured fraction is only slightly lower than the initial fraction , indicating that relatively few lmxbs have escaped from globular clusters in these galaxies .",
    "however , for the three s0 galaxies ( ngc  1553 , ngc  3115 , and ngc  1332 ) the measured fraction is about a factor of two less than the initial fraction , indicating that a significant number of globular cluster lmxbs have escaped into the field in these galaxies .",
    "this is illustrated further in figure  [ fig : field ] , where it can be seen that the field @xmath38 values of the s0 galaxies ngc  3115 and ngc  1332 ( ngc  1553 has large statistical uncertainties ) are several sigma above the best - fit predicted initial @xmath38 value of @xmath73 ergs s@xmath1 l@xmath50 ( our best - fit constant @xmath14 from   [ sec : lxlb ] ) , with the difference being from lmxbs ejected from globular clusters into the field .",
    "such an effect is seen to a lesser extent in the elliptical galaxies ngc  4365 and ngc  1399 , where fewer lmxbs were ejected from lmxbs .",
    "the shape of the @xmath38 versus @xmath8 relation for the 12 early - type galaxies in our sample strongly argues that the number of lmxbs in a galaxy does not scale directly with the number of globular clusters the galaxy contains .",
    "we have demonstrated that the non zero @xmath63-intercept of the @xmath38 versus @xmath8 relation is not the result of large - scale globular cluster destruction or a variation in the red  to  blue globular cluster ratio but instead can only be explained in terms of a population of lmxbs that formed within the field .",
    "these field lmxbs are most likely primordial binary systems formed during the the last major star formation episode of the galaxies 512 billion years ago .",
    "obviously , these sources can not be persistent x - ray emitters , since the mass accretion rates needed to power the observed x - ray luminosities would consume all the mass of a @xmath74 m@xmath66 donor star in @xmath75 yr .",
    "the onset of the x - ray active phase of the lmxb may be delayed by several billion years in wider binary systems if the donor star is required to enter its red giant phase in order to overflow its roche lobe .",
    "in addition , wide binaries are expected to be transient in nature , with lmxbs with periods of @xmath76 day expected to be in their  off \" stage @xmath77 of the time ( piro & bildsten 2002 ) , further lengthening the lifetime of an lmxb system . on the other hand , lmxbs within globular clusters",
    "are most likely short - period systems owing to the fact that frequent stellar encounters will serve to tighten the orbit of an existing binary , leading to persistent x - ray emission in these systems ( again from piro & bildsten 2002 ) .",
    "this expected transient nature of long - period primordial lmxbs and persistent nature of short - period dynamically - created lmxbs could be used as a means of confirming that present - day field lmxbs were created in the field if multi - epoch x - ray observations find that field lmxbs are transient whereas globular cluster lmxbs are persistent emitters .",
    "the largely transient nature of field lmxbs would also imply that the efficiency of creating lmxbs in the field is much higher than previously thought , since at any given time we are only observing the small fraction of the total field lmxb population that happen to be in their  on \" ( @xmath78 ergs s@xmath1 ) state .    given that @xmath8 generally increases with galactic radius ( ashman & zepf 1998 ) , equation  [ eq : lxlb ] predicts that @xmath38 should increase with increasing galactic radius .",
    "this is in fact seen in ngc  1399 , for which the measured @xmath38 increases by about 50% as @xmath8 increases from 4.7 in the @xmath29 annular bin to 7.3 in the @xmath30 annular bin .",
    "the fraction of lmxbs found within globular clusters should also increase as a function of radius as the number of globular cluster lmxbs increases ( per unit light ) , whereas the number of field lmxbs remains constant ( also per unit light ) .",
    "deeper _ chandra _ observations will test this prediction , although considerable care will be needed to account for the fact that contamination by background agn is more prevalent at larger radii , and failure to account for this will lead to an underestimate of the true fraction of lmxbs within globular clusters .",
    "also , the effects of possible radial gradients in the red / blue ratio of globular clusters will need to be properly accounted for in determining the fraction of lmxbs within globular clusters as a function of radius .",
    "another key result of this study is that the fraction of lmxbs currently within globular clusters of s0 galaxies is only half of the initial fraction of lmxbs within globular clusters predicted from the @xmath38 versus @xmath8 relation .",
    "this effect is not seen in the elliptical galaxies in our sample , for which the predicted initial fractions of lmxbs within globular clusters is consistent with ( albeit slightly lower than ) the measured fractions .",
    "it is unlikely that the higher than expected fraction of field lmxbs in s0s is the result of lmxbs forming more efficiently in the fields of s0s than in ellipticals , since the required number of  extra \" field lmxbs would lead to @xmath79 values for s0s that are a factor of 2 greater than in elliptical galaxies with the same @xmath8 , and @xmath61 values that are 3 times higher .",
    "previous studies have indicated that there are no discernible differences in the properties of globular clusters within s0 and elliptical galaxies that might account for the increased escape rate of lmxbs from globular clusters within s0 galaxies .",
    "kundu & whitmore ( 2001a,2001b ) found that mean colors , mean half - light radii , and luminosity functions of the globular clusters found in samples of s0 and elliptical galaxies were statistically identical .",
    "this would argue that the lmxb ejection mechanism does not involve processes internal to the clusters such as supernova kicks .",
    "another reason why supernova kicks are not favored is that such a kick would remove the neutron star or black hole from the globular cluster only a few million years after the formation of the cluster .",
    "spending such a short period of time within the cluster would eliminate the advantage that globular clusters have in creating lmxbs ( maccarone et al .",
    "2003 ) , meaning that these lmxbs would effectively be primordial binaries too . instead",
    ", it is more likely that lmxbs within globular clusters of s0 galaxies have been removed by the tidal disruption ( but not destruction ) of globular clusters .",
    "this effect is expected to be more pronounced within s0 galaxies than in elliptical galaxies , owing to the presence of disks in s0s that are lacking in ellipticals .",
    "gravitational shocks caused by the passage of a globular cluster through a disk are much stronger than passage through a bulge distribution ( fall & zhang 2001 ) , leading to a greater number of lmxbs ejected from globular clusters in s0 galaxies than in ellipticals .",
    "clearly , more observations are needed to confirm this hypothesis .",
    "if the field lmxbs in s0s are composed of a mix of primordial binaries and lmxbs ejected from globular clusters , then the former should be transient x - ray emitters while the latter should be persistent emitters .",
    "on the other hand , field lmxbs within elliptical galaxies should nearly all be transient . once again",
    ", multi - epoch x - ray observations of the field lmxbs could confirm this picture if the predicted ratio of persistent  to  transient field lmxbs is measured .",
