    "in recent years , the experimental accessibility of the single and multi layered graphene samples  @xcite has attracted considerable theoretical and experimental attention due to its unusual electronic structure described by the dirac equation , namely electrons in monolayer graphene have linear dispersion thus behave like massless dirac fermions at the corners of the brillouin zone ( bz )  @xcite . in the presence of magnetic field perpendicular to the graphene plane",
    ", the system shows anomalous integer quantum hall effect  @xcite ( iqhe ) which is different from that of the conventional two - dimensional electron system in semiconductor heterostructures .",
    "the hall conductivity in the iqhe of graphene shows half integer plateaus instead of integer ones in the iqhe of a normal semiconductor due to the different degeneracy at @xmath0 landau level .",
    "edge states in graphene have been the focus of much theoretical study because of the important role they play in transport .",
    "@xcite it is well known that there are two basic types of edges in graphene , namely , the armchair and zigzag edges .",
    "some theoretical work  @xcite on the electronic structure of finite - sized systems , either as molecules or as one - dimensional systems , has shown that graphene with zigzag edge has localized edge states at the fermi energy , but those with armchair edges do not have such state .",
    "therefore , the zigzag edge states is essential to the transport properties in graphene since the localized edge state has contribution to the conductivity .",
    "however , most of the work were focused on the uniform monolayer and bilayer graphene . on the other hand",
    "the hybrid edge structure composed of partial monolayer and partial bilayer graphene , which is quit general in reality , has received not so much attention .",
    "experimentally ,  @xcite the anomalous quantum oscillations in magnetoconductance was observed due to the peculiar physics along the interface .",
    "some of the transport properties and the presence of interface landau levels was explored within an effective - mass approximation .",
    "@xcite    in this work@xcite , we study the electronic properties of the hybrid interface systematically via both tight binding model and its effective theory in the continuum limit - the dirac equation .",
    "the edge states in graphene can be studied experimentally by using a local probe such as scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) .",
    "the stm experiments measure the differential conductance which is proportional to the density of states .",
    "thus we study the local density of states ( ldos ) in different hybridized zigzag edge graphene .",
    "it is defined as : n(r , ev ) = |_(r)|^2 ( ev - e _ ) , where @xmath1 is the eigenfunction with energy @xmath2 .",
    "the ldos shows the strength of the local electronic density which is related to the strength of the signal in stm experimental data .",
    "therefore , the ldos can show us the signals of the different edge state as in our previous work .",
    "@xcite in this paper , our study of the step edge graphene shows that there are two different zigzag step edge , and there always exists zero energy states localized near the zigzag step edge but the distribution of ldos of these edge states strongly depends on the details of how the edge stacks together .",
    "we find the energy dispersion around the dirac cones also presents different characters for different edge arrangements either within or without a magnetic field .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows : in section ii , we set up the model hamiltonian in different geometries .",

    "we also see an effect of the effective potential barrier imposed by the @xmath36 in the dispersive landau levels near the interface . for a certain range of field strength",
    "the dispersion develops a local maximum for @xmath36 while the @xmath35 only develops a plateau feature .    in summary ,",
    "the physical properties of hybrid graphene systems are mostly dominated by both that of monolayer and bilayer .",
    "the landau levels remain the same away from the interface .",
    "but the existence of dispersive landau levels near the interface could be related to the unexpected feature other than that of the monolayer and bilayer graphene in the magneto transport experiment@xcite .",
    "further study of the hybrid structures for a more realistic setup , like including edge disorder , gate voltage , etc . , are needed to undertand the experimental data .",
