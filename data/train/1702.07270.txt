    "star formation in galaxies is ultimately regulated by the external supply of gas that can rapidly cool and settle at the high densities of star - forming regions .",
    "the star formation rate ( sfr ) probed by the kennicut - schmidt relation @xcite , or by the madau plot @xcite , is essentially determined by the cosmological environment controlling the mass infall from the cosmic web onto the galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the radial transport in the galactic disk from low density gas at large radii to high density gas at smaller radii",
    ". the dark matter component of this boundary condition of galaxies is well understood in the standard @xmath7cdm model , while the structure of the baryonic component of the infall has been studied with large dynamic range simulations including gas dynamics .",
    "however , galaxies can achieve a global sfr in approximate balance with the cosmological infall through a variety of paths , leading to or requiring different galaxy morphologies and different dynamical and chemical evolutions .",
    "for example , the star formation may be smoothly distributed in space or time , or may occur in rapid bursts within massive clouds .",
    "the detailed mode of star formation is only partly dependent on the large - scale boundary conditions ; it is primarily controlled by disk dynamics ( e.g. gravitational instability and radial transport ) and by the physics of star formation , meaning the specific processes responsible for the evolution and fragmentation of cold interstellar medium ( ism ) clouds .",
    "the theoretical modeling of such processes should result in a physical law that predicts the sfr as a function of star - forming cloud parameters .",
    "the formation and evolution of galaxies can not be fully understood until such a universal sfr law is revealed .    despite recent progress in modeling the effect of supersonic turbulence on the fragmentation of star - forming clouds , the development of large dynamic range simulations of star formation , and the ever growing number and size of galactic and extragalactic surveys of star forming regions ,",
    "sfr laws remain very hard to test .",
    "the sfr in mcs is difficult to measure , with different methods often yielding very different values .",
    "the cloud physical parameters on which the theoretical models depend ( for example the ratio of gas and magnetic pressures , or the ratio of compressive to solenoidal power of the velocity field ) are difficult to measure as well .",
    "furthermore , recent compilations of mc properties including their sfr have shown that the sfr has only a weak dependence on cloud parameters and a very large scatter ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in apparent contradiction of most theoretical models .",
    "besides the very large scatter , the observed sfrs also tend to be lower than both numerical estimates and theoretical predictions .",
    "on the other hand , idealized numerical simulations of supersonic turbulence have been used to test theoretical sfr laws with some success @xcite .",
    "they have also yielded best - fit values of the free parameters of the theoretical models .",
    "these simulations tend to give larger sfr than the observations , even when the turbulence is well resolved and relatively strong magnetic fields are included .",
    "more importantly , they do not yield the large scatter in sfr , for fixed physical parameters , found in the observations .",
    "thus , while our theoretical understanding of the star formation process has improved significantly with the interplay of theory and simulations , our ability to reproduce the observations remains limited , casting doubts upon the theoretical scenario of turbulent fragmentation .",
    "nevertheless , we believe the discrepancies with the observations are mainly the consequence of the limitations of the simulations .",
    "more realistic simulations should reproduce the observations and guide a revision of the theoretical sfr models , while retaining the key idea that star - forming clouds are fragmented by supersonic turbulence .",
    "the main limitation of the idealized simulations used to test the sfr models is that they capture the fundamental physics of supersonic mhd turbulence , without describing a full cloud , its realistic boundary conditions and its realistic evolution including the cloud formation and dispersion processes .",
    "the simulations adopt periodic boundary conditions , so they are interpreted as a characteristic piece of a mc , and they are started from idealized initial conditions , so they must be evolved for several dynamical times to pursue a statistical steady state , before gravity is introduced . because of the need to first develop the turbulence , gravity has to be suddenly included at a later time , so even the initial evolution under the effect of gravity is not entirely realistic ; the simulation has to be run for at least one free - fall time with gravity , before the sfr is measured .",
    "the sfr is initially very low , when gravity is first included , and then gradually increases , in the best case ( but not always ) becoming approximately constant for at least a few free - fall times .",
    "it is this late time , approximately ( or ` hopefully ' ) constant sfr that is usually measured in the simulations , to avoid the initial transient phase that reflects the imprint of the numerical setup .",
    "thus , the sfr derived in this way from the simulations does not reflect the initial time variations , because it does not record the low sfr values of the initial transient phase .",
    "real mcs also have an initial phase when they are first assembled and their sfr may be very small .",
    "they may also become more quiescent after exhausting most of their dense gas , or reduce their sfr rapidly during a period of cloud dispersion , towards the end of their lifetime .",
    "but this time evolution of mcs and variability of their sfr can not be described with the idealized simulations mentioned above .",
    "thus , it is to be expected that only the highest sfr values of mcs are reproduced by the simulations , while lower values are neglected because their frequency can not be estimated with the idealized numerical setups .",
    "furthermore , the physical parameters that controls the sfr , such as mach number , virial parameter and gas to magnetic pressure ratio , are usually averaged over the whole computational domain , which is not the same as measuring them for a whole mc .",
    "the alternative approach of simulating a whole cloud from the moment of its formation must rely on ad hoc and idealized initial conditions , where velocity , density and magnetic fields can only mimic and grossly misrepresent the turbulence in real mcs . because gravity is present from the beginning , the star formation process starts rapidly , and the artificial initial conditions leave a strong imprint on star formation .",
    "sfr values derived in this way can not be used to faithfully sample the variations of the sfr in real mcs .    the only way to model",
    "the range of variations of the sfr in mcs is to adopt a numerical setup where mcs are formed _",
    "ab initio _ , meaning without ad hoc initial or boundary conditions .",
    "this can only be achieved by simulating a volume much larger than the size of a single mc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is expensive , but well worth the cost , because a large volume yields a large population of mcs , all emerging from initial and boundary conditions with realistic probability distributions .",
    "with a single large scale run , the sfr evolution can be followed over time in each cloud , generating realistic variations in time and from cloud to cloud as well .",
    "very low sfr can then be realized as well , and both average values and scatter of the sfr as a function of physical parameters can be compared with the observations and with theoretical models , which is the goal of the present work .",
    "such a large scale simulation was already presented in our previous three papers of this series ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* paper i , paper ii and paper iii hereafter ) , where we studied the properties of the ism turbulence driven by supernova ( sn ) explosions .",
    "the properties of mcs formed self - consistently in the turbulent ism of the simulation were found to agree with those of real mcs from the @xmath8co fcrao outer galaxy survey @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we adopt the same numerical setup as a ` laboratory ' to study star formation in mcs , by increasing the spatial resolution of the simulation and including accreting sink particles to describe the formation of massive stars . in this new simulation , the turbulence is driven by the explosion of massive stars whose formation is resolved , so both the timing and position of the sne , hence their effect on mcs @xcite , is now much more realistic than in the previous simulation ( or any simulation of sn - driven turbulence to date ) , where the sne where generated randomly in space and time .",
    "the main limitation of this setup is the lack of even larger scales , as our computational domain is a cubic volume of 250 pc size with periodic boundary conditions ( hence fixed total mass ) , neglecting differential rotation and the vertical gravitational potential of the galactic disk .",
    "however , such limitation is unlikely to affect directly the sfr within individual mcs .",

    "as we restart at @xmath24 myr , we continue to run without self - gravity , and increase the root grid size to @xmath44 cells , besides adding four amr levels to reach a minimum cell size of @xmath45 pc .",
    "we also initialize 250 million passively advected tracer particles , each representing a fluid element with a characteristic mass of approximately 0.008 @xmath23 .",
    "the tracers record all the hydrodynamic variables , and are tagged once they accrete onto a sink particle , so the star formation process can be entirely followed through the lagrangian point of view of the tracers .",
    "one of the goals of the new simulation is to describe the sn driving with a precise knowledge of the time and location of each sn , by resolving the formation of all massive stars .",
    "to reduce the role of the ` artificial ' randomly generated sne , we gradually decrease their rate as the rate of the realistically generated sne increases , so we start by reducing the random sn rate by a factor of two .",
    "we continue the simulation for 10.5 myr , with a random sn rate of only 3.12 sne myr@xmath31 , with the increased resolution , and with the new set of tracer particles . at @xmath46 myr",
    "we include self - gravity and add two more amr levels , reaching a maximum resolution of @xmath47 pc .",
    "this resolution yields a complete stellar initial mass function ( imf ) down to a stellar mass of order 5 - 10 m@xmath10 ( though significantly lower - mass sink particles are also formed ) .",
    "the imf is approximately a power law , with a slope only slightly steeper than the observed saltpeter s value , thus the relative number of sne , resulting from the explosion of the massive stars formed in the simulation , has a realistic mass and time dependence ( besides a realistic spatial istribution ) .    to follow the collapse of prestellar cores , sink particles are created in cells where the gas density is larger than @xmath48 @xmath13 ( approximately 10 times larger than the largest density reached by the turbulence without self - gravity ) , if the following additional conditions are met at the cell location : i ) the gravitational potential has a local minimum value , ii ) the three - dimensional velocity divergence is negative , and iii ) no other previously created sink particle is present within an exclusion radius , @xmath49 ( @xmath50 pc in this simulation ) .",
    "these conditions are similar to those in @xcite .",
    "we have verified that they avoid the creation of spurious sink particles in regions where the gas is not collapsing .",
    "an extensive presentation of our sink particle implementation in ramses can be found in haugblle et al .",
    "( 2017 ) .",
    "we plan to continue this simulation for @xmath51 myr with self - gravity and sink particles , in order to reach a fully self - consistent solution , where the ism turbulence and the star formation process are driven entirely by the explosion of massive stars formed in the simulation , including the least massive ones , of approximately 7.5 m@xmath10 , that have a lifetime of nearly 50 myr @xcite .",
    "so far , we have reached @xmath52 myr , that is 20 myr with self - gravity , yielding more than 6000 sink particles , a sufficiently long time for the purpose of this paper , which is to study the sfr in mcs . even at the current stage , this is a challenging computational project that has already used approximately 20 million core hours on the pleiades supercomputer at nasa / ames .",
    "the projected density from two snapshots of the simulation taken at 14.6 and 19.3 myr after the inclusion of self - gravity are shown in figure [ images_gas ] .",
    "the gas distribution is highly filamentary on all scales and all densities , with large voids created by the explosions of multiple sne . in figure",

    "young sinks are found inside the densest filaments , while older ones have already left their parent clouds .",
    "some dense clusters have also cleared their surrounding gas thanks to sn explosions of their most massive members .",
    "the large number of mcs generated by this simulation , in combination with several hundreds of sne from resolved massive stars and several thousands of sink particles , make up an unprecedented numerical sample to study the interaction of sne with their parent clouds and to investigate the amount of clustering in space and time of sne of different masses .",
    "these studies are deferred to a separate paper .",
    "the analysis of the global sfr under this fully self - consistent sn driving will also be addressed elsewhere , once the simulation will be closer to the final goal of @xmath51 myr with self - gravity and sink particles . here",
    ", it is worth mentioning that , while producing realistic sfr values within mcs , this simulation has currently a global sfr corresponding to a gas depletion time of the order of 1 gyr , consistent with global galactic values @xcite .",

    "the depletion time , @xmath55 , is defined as : @xmath56 in figure [ sfe_time ] , the short - dashed and long - dashed lines show @xmath37 versus time for depletion times @xmath38 and 0.8 gyr , respectively .",
    "one can see that the global sfr corresponds approximately to these values of @xmath55 in the approximate time intervals 61 - 67 myr and 67 - 74 myr . at the same time , the clouds selected in the simulation as described in the following section exhibits a much steeper time dependence of their local @xmath37 , as shown by the short thin lines in figure [ sfe_time ] , and by the shaded areas illustrating the average cloud depletion time of 51 myr .",
    "this is the first time that a value of @xmath55 characteristic of global galactic values is derived in a simulation where both the star formation and its feedback are resolved , for each individual massive stars , instead of being imposed with subgrid - scale models .",
    "the simulation does not model the formation of ism molecules , so we define the clouds simply as connected regions above a threshold density , @xmath57 , and refer to them as mcs . to keep track of the effect of the value of @xmath57 , we consider two values , @xmath12 @xmath13 and @xmath34 @xmath13 .",
    "the mc search is carried out at a uniform resolution of @xmath44 cells , that is a spatial resolution of 0.49 pc , but the cloud properties are computed using all the tracer particles identified within each cloud . because the tracers record all the hydrodynamical variables interpolated at their position , and due to the very large number of tracers in high density regions , mc properties are derived with the hydrodynamical variables sampled at the highest local spatial resolution of the amr grid , up to the highest resolution of 0.0076 pc in the densest regions .",
    "mcs are selected from 10 snapshots , at equal intervals of 1.5 myr , with the first snapshot at 4.0 myr after the inclusion of self - gravity in the simulation . only clouds satisfying the following three conditions",
    "are retained : 1 ) the cloud mass is @xmath58 m@xmath10 , 2 ) the rms velocity is @xmath59 km / s ( to avoid mcs too strongly affected by recent nearby sne ) , 3 ) the cloud does not disperse during the next 1.5 myr , meaning that it is not doubling its effective size in that time interval ( to avoid mcs whose properties are evolving too rapidly ) . with these conditions , the number of mcs is reduced from 391 to 313 , 203 clouds with @xmath12 @xmath13 and 110 clouds with @xmath34 @xmath13 .",
    "the conditions allow for a better comparison with the sfr model that does not account for transient processes like sn feedback or cloud dispersal .",
    "it may yield a sample more suitable for the comparison with the observations as well , because mcs strongly affected by sne , or in the process of being dispersed , may also suffer from a strong feedback by hii regions , which is not modeled in the simulation .    in the following",
    ", we will compute for each cloud the three non - dimensional parameters , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , expressing the ratios of turbulent , gravitational , thermal and magnetic energies .",

    "the rms mach number is the ratio of the three - dimensional rms velocity and the sound speed , @xmath65 : @xmath66 and @xmath3 is the ratio of gas to magnetic pressure : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the rms alfvnic mach number , @xmath69 , with @xmath70 the alfvn velocity , @xmath71 is the adiabatic index , and we have used the adiabatic sound speed , @xmath72 .          to estimate the non - dimensional parameters for mcs , we need to compute the cloud mass , @xmath61 , radius , @xmath60 , velocity dispersion , @xmath62 , sound speed , @xmath65 , magnetic pressure , @xmath73 and thermal pressure @xmath74 .",
    "the cloud radius is defined as the equivalent radius of the circle with area equal to the cloud projected ( along a randomly chosen axis direction ) area , @xmath75 , @xmath76 the cloud rms velocity is defined as the density - weighted one - dimensional rms velocity , and is computed from the velocity of the tracer particles : @xmath77^{1/2 } , \\label{eq_sigv}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 are the components of the mean tracer particle velocity , and @xmath79 is the total number of tracer particles in the cloud .",
    "we choose these definitions of radius and velocity dispersion because they relate directly to the observable ones , so they yield estimates of the virial parameter that should be comparable to the observational values . furthermore , we have previously found that the virial parameter based on these definitions of radius and velocity dispersion is very close to the actual energy ratio in realistic mcs , selected with our previous sn - driven simulation ( see sections 7 and 10.5 and equation ( 26 ) in paper i ) .",
    "thus , in this work we use the effective virial parameter , @xmath80 and the effective dynamical time , @xmath81 it is important to realize that @xmath82 defined with the projected area is the same as that defined with the cloud volume , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , only in the case of a spherical cloud . in general ,",

    "although we do nt know the correction factor in the case of real mcs , it is likely the free - fall time ( hence @xmath0 ) is slightly overestimated as the cloud mean density is usually computed as @xmath86 .",
    "the mach number is computed as in equation ( [ eq_mach ] ) , where @xmath65 is derived from the mass - weighted average temperature ( the average value of the temperature associated to the tracers ) and @xmath90 , using equation ( [ eq_sigv ] ) , which should yield values comparable to observational estimates of mc mach numbers .",

    "the weight is proportional to the volume of the gas element represented by the tracer , so we obtain a volume - averaged @xmath3 . observed values of @xmath3 may be estimated from the dispersion of the polarization angle in mcs . due to the drop in polarization fraction with increasing density ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "our mcs have equivalent radii in the range 2.6 - 23.5 pc , and column densities in the range 10 - 80 m@xmath10pc@xmath11 . despite the difference in the average column density and size of the two cloud samples , the slopes of the relations",
    "are essentially the same , and are also consistent with the observations and with results from our previous sn - driven simulation ( see papers i and ii ) .",

    "the gas to magnetic pressure is in the range 0.09 - 1.3 , with an average value @xmath94 , and decreases with increasing @xmath62 , showing that the magnetic field in the clouds is amplified by the cloud turbulence , as the thermal pressure does not vary much from cloud to cloud .",

    "the average cloud lifetime is rather short , @xmath216 ( see paper i ) , and mcs are hardly isolated objects : they are part of a complex filamentary network where mass accretion onto the clouds may not be negligible , and the cloud structure is ever changing , with the cloud ultimately being dispersed .",
    "while the mc turbulence is driven by sne with an effective outer scale of order 70 - 100 pc ( see paper i ) , nearby sne can also affect the clouds directly , temporarily changing the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath20 ( for example causing a sudden increase in the cloud rms mach number , while only affecting a relatively small fraction of the cloud mass and thus not modifying the sfr significantly . )",
    "as explained in section [ sec_sfr ] , we computed the sfr as an average over a time @xmath110 myr .",
    "although the scatter in the sfr may be reduced by averaging over a significantly longer time ( the average dynamical time of the clouds in our samples is nearly 3.0 myr , so the average lifetime may be of order 13 myr ) , we did not try to define the sfr over larger @xmath131 .",
    "this is because large variations from cloud to cloud are also found from the observations , thus it is important to avoid measuring the sfr in the simulation in a way that can not be related to the observational sfr estimates .",
    "as discussed below , the sfr is measured in nearby mcs by counting the number of protostars , and assuming a typical protostellar lifetime of 2 myr , which is probably a reasonable estimate of the duration of class ii protostars @xcite . even when the sfr is measured in a sample of clusters selected by free - free emission of ionized gas ,",
    "the typical cluster lifetime is probably of the order of 2 myr , at least if the star formation process is very rapid , because the free - free emission is expected to strongly decay in a time of order 4 myr , essentially the lifetime of the massive stars that contribute the most to the ionized flux @xcite .",
    "thus , our value of @xmath131 is comparable to the characteristic age of the young stellar populations used in the determination of the sfr in real mcs .",
    "furthermore , as explained in section [ sec_sfr ] , we avoid longer @xmath131 also to limit uncertainties related to the cloud identification , such as the possibility of a significant mass accretion ( which we neglect ) or the chance that a cloud is completely dispersed during the time we measure the sfr .    given this unavoidable scatter in @xmath0 at constant @xmath20",
    ", we conclude that sfr models should be compared with simulations or observations by computing ensemble averages with large cloud samples .",
    "this has been achieved with our simulation , allowing us to show that , despite the scatter , the values of @xmath0 averaged in logarithmic bins of @xmath20 closely follow the revised model ( see figure [ sfr_alpha ] ) .",
    "observational efforts should also aim at compiling very large samples of mcs with estimated values of @xmath0 and cloud parameters .",
    "the average sfr in mcs can be deduced from the global sfr in the galaxy .",
    "for example , @xcite derived a value of @xmath217 , and @xcite a value approximately three times smaller , @xmath218 , due primarily to a different imf assumption . to move beyond global values and derive the dependence of the sfr on physical parameters it is necessary to study the properties of individual mcs and directly measure their sfr .",
    "focusing on the most active star - forming regions in the galaxy , selected by their free - free emission , @xcite found a rather large mean sfr , @xmath219 , and , more importantly , a very wide range of values , from 0.001 to 0.59 .",
    "@xcite selected star - forming regions based on a catalog of hii regions @xcite , but derived much lower sfrs , based on the 22 @xmath28 m band of the wise satellite @xcite , with an average value of @xmath220 , of the order of the mean galactic value .",
    "the mid - infrared ( mir ) method they used may systematically underestimate the sfr by a factor of 2 - 3 , so their corrected average value may be as large as 0.02 .",
    "although the lists of objects by @xcite and @xcite could in principle be used to compare the sfr with the cloud properties , there is a large uncertainty in the association of an hii region with an individual mc .",
    "furthermore , the measured cloud velocity dispersion may be significantly affected by the feedback from massive stars , especially in the case of the most active star - forming clouds .",
    "this would produce a dependence of the virial parameter on the sfr , rather than probing the dependence of the sfr on the virial parameter .",
    "@xmath13 ( empty circles ) .",
    "the dashed line is the same analytical fit to our model prediction , @xmath108 , as in previous figures .",
    "the dotted line is our model prediction for a single set of parameters , using the average mach number value in the observational sample , @xmath221 ( assuming the observed clouds have the same mean temperature as the clouds from the simulation ) , and the same @xmath161 and @xmath3 as the average values from the simulation , @xmath169 and @xmath222 ( because they are unknown for the observed clouds ) .",
    "the green shaded area shows the estimated @xmath0 and @xmath20 for the cmz clouds , from @xcite and barnes et al .",
    "( 2017 ) . ]",
    "to avoid the large uncertainties in the properties of distant clouds associated with hii regions , we compare our numerical results with the observations using only data from well - studied nearby mcs . @xcite",
    "derived mc properties and sfrs for 29 clouds from the c2d @xcite and gould belt @xcite _ spitzer _ legacy programs .",
    "they found an average value of @xmath223 ( 0.016 including the four clouds with @xmath107 ) , by counting all the protostars in the clouds , and assuming a mean stellar mass of 0.5 m@xmath224 and a timescale of 2 myr for class ii protostars .    in figure [ sfr_alpha_evans ] , we plot @xmath0 versus @xmath20 for these nearby mcs ( filled circles ) , and the @xmath20 values for the four clouds with @xmath107 ( large arrows at @xmath225 ) .",
    "we also plot the clouds from our numerical catalog with @xmath34 @xmath13 ( empty circles ) . including the clouds with @xmath107 , @xmath0 decreases with increasing @xmath20 , though not as rapidly as in the simulation .",
    "however , the average mach number of these clouds is 9.4 , compared with the value of 7.7 from our numerical samples ( using the same cloud mean temperature in both cases ) , so the @xmath0-@xmath20 relation is expected to be a bit shallower for the observed clouds than for the numerical samples .",
    "the dotted line in figure [ sfr_alpha_evans ] shows the prediction of our revised model with @xmath221 , while the dashed line is the analytical fit to the model applied to the clouds from the simulation , as in previous figures .",
    "the number of clouds in the observational sample is too low to define a clear relation between @xmath0 and @xmath20 , but the cloud sfrs are approximately distributed around the model prediction shown by the dotted line .",
    "furthermore , the values of @xmath0 of the clouds from the simulation appear to be consistent with those in nearby mcs . the scatter in @xmath0 increases with increasing @xmath20 both in the simulation and in the observations .",
    "the nearby mcs with @xmath226 span a wide range of values , @xmath227 , approximately the same as in the simulation .",
    "mcs from the central molecular zone ( cmz ) provide an important test for sfr models as well , because they probe star formation under physical conditions very different from those typical of normal mcs .",
    "mcs in the cmz are much denser and have much larger velocity dispersion for their size than mcs following standard larson s relations @xcite .",
    "they also have very strong magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it turns out that the cloud non - dimensional parameters that enter the sfr model are not very different from those of normal mcs . because the properties of the  brick \" cloud have been carefully derived by @xcite and thanks to the well defined timescale of star formation determined through the orbital model of cmz clouds by @xcite , the values of @xmath0 and @xmath20 are relatively well determined for the cmz ( barnes et al .",
    "the sfr value derived by barnes et al .",
    "( 2017 ) , @xmath228 , associated with the value @xmath229 from @xcite , are shown by the shaded area in figure [ sfr_alpha_evans ] .",
    "these values for the cmz are clearly consistent with our numerical results and with the prediction of our revised pn11 model .",
    "we have studied the sfr as a function of cloud parameters by generating a large sample of realistic mcs , formed _",
    "ab initio _ in a simulation of sn - driven turbulence in an ism region of 250 pc size .",
    "this simulation is a continuation of our previous sn - driven experiment presented in papers i , ii and iii , where we had already demonstrated that we could recover mc properties consistent with the observations . in this work , thanks to a significant increase of the spatial resolution and the introduction of sink particles , we can further test if the sfr in the clouds is consistent with the observations as well . although the global sfr in the simulation will be addressed elsewhere , we have anticipated that it corresponds to a depletion time of order 1 gyr , in agreement with global galactic values , which is also an important test for the simulation .",
    "the main results of this work are summarized in the following .    1 .",
    "the sfr per free - fall time in the mcs selected from the simulation follows a broad probability distribution , with a peak at @xmath6 , and a maximum value of approximately 0.2 . 2 .",
    "on average , @xmath0 in the simulation decreases with increasing @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath20 relation from the simulation has a large scatter that is not explained by cloud to cloud variations of the other non - dimensional parameters @xmath161 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "this scatter is most likely due to a combination of time variations in the high - density tail of the gas density pdf , random fluctuations of @xmath0 in clouds with a low number of stars ( sink particles ) , and a lack of statistical equilibrium of the mc turbulence , due to the transient nature of the mcs .",
    "the pn11 model has been revised , with the most important modification being the choice of the timescale .",
    "while in pn11 we chose the free - fall time of the critical density , @xmath170 , in the revised model we assume it is the timescale of formation of the characteristic post - shock structures responsible for the high - density tail of the gas density pdf , @xmath230 , because @xmath231 .",
    "this choice results in a sfr a few times lower than in the pn11 model , for characteristic parameters of mcs .",
    "5 .   applied to the mcs from the simulation , the revised model results in a @xmath0-@xmath20 relation with a rather small scatter , which is fit well by the relation @xmath232 .",
    "this relation is consistent with our previous result in @xcite , where we had already concluded that @xmath0 depends primarily on the virial parameter .",
    "the values of @xmath0 in the mcs selected from the simulation , averaged in logarithmic intervals of @xmath20 , follow the prediction of our revised pn11 model , @xmath108 ( at least for @xmath233 ) .",
    "the model predictions are also followed closely by individual clouds with @xmath215 , for which the role of random fluctuations of @xmath0 is expected to be small .",
    "the sfr measured in well studied nearby mcs from direct counts of protostars is consistent with the sfr values of the clouds in the simulation and with our model predictions . as in the simulation ,",
    "the scatter is large also in the observational values of @xmath0 , and increases towards larger values of @xmath20 .",
    "the sfr in the cmz , estimated with the aid of a study of the physical properties of the  brick \" cloud and of an orbital model of the clouds in the cmz , is also consistent with our numerical results and our theoretical predictions .",
    "one of the most valuable findings of this investigation is the large scatter of @xmath0 , including both large variations from cloud to cloud , even at comparable values of @xmath20 , and time variations within individual clouds .",
    "this result has been achieved thanks to the very large number of clouds formed _",
    "ab initio _ in the simulation , each contributing to an ensemble of realistic initial and boundary conditions with probability distributions that may closely match those of real mcs .",
    "the instantaneous value of the @xmath0 of a given cloud can not be accurately predicted based on the cloud physical parameters , and can even deviate significantly from the prediction of the theoretical model , because of the ever - changing nature of mcs embedded in the complex filamentary structure of the cold ism , and the continuous driving by sne , with occasional explosions in close proximity or even within the cloud . despite this chaotic nature of the sfr in mcs",
    ", we have found that an ensemble average obtained by selecting a very large number of clouds from many snapshots of the simulation yields values of @xmath0 within logarithmic intervals of @xmath20 that nicely fit the model prediction .",
