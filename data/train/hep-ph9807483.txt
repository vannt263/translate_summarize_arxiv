    "four - fermion contact interaction is not something new , but was proposed decades ago by fermi to account for the nuclear beta decay .",
    "the interaction is represented by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the fermi constant with dimension ( mass)@xmath5 .",
    "this interaction is not renormalizable because amplitudes grow indefinitely with the energy scale if @xmath4 is kept constant .",
    "it was only until 60 s that the electroweak theory was proposed .",
    "the four - fermion contact interaction was then replaced by exchange of weak gauge bosons and @xmath4 replaced by the @xmath6 boson propagator : @xmath7 .",
    "the weak gauge bosons were only discovered later when the energy scale reached the hundred gev level . in the above history",
    "we learn a couple of lessons : ( i ) the existence of four - fermion contact interactions is a signal of new physics beyond the existing standard theory ; ( ii ) the exact nature of new physics is unknown at the low energy scale .",
    "only when the energy scale is high enough can the nature of new physics be probed .",
    "the purpose of this analysis @xcite is to examine the data from current accelerator experiments to see if there is any sign of contact interactions . if so it is a signal of new physics ; if not we put limits on the compositeness scale @xmath8 .",
    "four - fermion contact interactions have been searched in recent high energy experiments : ( i ) the @xmath9 contact interaction studied at the tevatron by cdf @xcite ; ( ii ) @xmath10 interactions at lep @xcite , hera @xcite , drell - yan production at the tevatron @xcite , and low energy @xmath0-nucleon scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "we concentrate on @xmath10 contact interactions .",
    "in particular , the neutral current ( nc ) deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) data collected by h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite at hera between 199496 showed a significant excess in cross section in the high-@xmath11 region , which aroused an enormous amount of phenomenological activities .",
    "one of the explanations is the @xmath10 contact interaction at the scale of 3 tev .",
    "however , the data collected in 1997 alone agreed very well with the sm and , therefore , the logical explanation for the excess in 1996 was statistical fluctuation .",
    "the overall result of the combined 94 - 97 data is as follows @xcite : ( i ) data by zeus agreed with the sm expectation up to @xmath12 while there are 2 events at @xmath13 , where only @xmath14 is expected ; ( ii ) data by h1 only showed a slight deviation above the sm for @xmath15 and the excess events in the mass window of 200 gev are now much less significant . although the outcome is somewhat discouraging for searching for new physics , we can , however , use the data to constrain new physics .",
    "the objective here is to constrain the @xmath10 contact interactions using the global data , which include : ( i ) nc dis data at hera @xcite , ( ii ) drell - yan production at the tevatron @xcite , ( iii ) total hadronic cross sections at lep and the left - right asymmetry at sld @xcite , ( iv ) atomic physics parity violation measurement @xcite on @xmath16 , ( v ) low energy @xmath0-n scattering experiments @xcite , and ( vi ) low energy @xmath1-n scattering experiment by ccfr @xcite .",
    "we shall obtain fits of parameters of @xmath10 contact interactions and finally the limits on the compositeness scale @xmath8 .",
    "in this write - up , we shall summarize the analysis in ref .",
    "the results presented here , however , use the more updated data since ref . @xcite .",
    "the conventional effective lagrangian of @xmath17 contact interactions has the form @xmath18 \\ , , \\label{effl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where eight independent coefficients @xmath19 and @xmath20 have dimension ( tev)@xmath5 and are conventionally expressed as @xmath21 , with a fixed @xmath22 .",
    "the sign factor @xmath23 allows for either constructive or destructive interference with the sm @xmath24 and @xmath25 exchange amplitudes and @xmath26 represents the mass scale of the exchanged new particles , with coupling strength @xmath27 . a coupling of this order is expected in substructure models and therefore @xmath26",
    "is sometimes called the `` compositeness scale '' .",
    "left - handed electrons and quarks belong to su(2 ) doublets @xmath28 and @xmath29 and thus from su(2 ) symmetry one expects relations between contact terms involving left - handed @xmath30 or @xmath31 quarks ; similarly , contact terms for left - handed electrons and neutrinos should be related .",
    "we start with the most general @xmath32 invariant contact term lagrangian , @xmath33 by expanding the @xmath34 term we have @xmath35 in addition , the four neutrino and the lepton couplings are related by su(2 ) , @xmath36 in our analysis , the relations of eqs .",
    "( [ su2reler ] ) and ( [ su2relnu ] ) are only used when neutrino scattering data are included in the analysis . even though we expect that @xmath32 will be a symmetry of the renormalizable interactions which ultimately manifest themselves as the contact terms of eq .",
    "( [ effl ] ) , electroweak symmetry breaking may break the degeneracy of su(2 ) multiplets of new , heavy quanta whose exchanges give rise to ( [ effl ] ) .",
    "this would result in a violation of the relations of eqs .",
    "( [ su2reler ] ) and ( [ su2relnu ] ) .",
    "one example is the exchange of the stop @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and the sbottom @xmath39 in @xmath40-parity violating susy models .",
    "the large top - quark mass may lead to substantial splitting of the masses of these squarks which could easily lead to violations by up to a factor of two of su(2 ) relations such as @xmath41 .",
    "because of severe experimental constraints on intergenerational transitions like @xmath42 we restrict our discussion to first generation contact terms .",
    "only where required by particular data ( e.g. the muon sample of drell - yan production at the tevatron ) will we assume universality of contact terms between @xmath0 and @xmath43 .",
    "the global data used in this analysis have been described in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we only list those that have been updated since then .      the 1997 data alone by h1 and zeus agreed very well with the sm expectation , though the combined 19941997 data still showed an excess of cross section at high @xmath11 .",
    "the significance of excess is far less severe now .",
    "we use the @xmath11 distribution presented in the 1998 spring conferences @xcite .",
    "note that using @xmath11 distribution will not reduce appreciably the sensitivity to contact interactions than using the @xmath44-@xmath45 distribution , because @xmath44 distribution is not sensitive to contact interactions ( unlike the narrow - width leptoquark model ) but @xmath45 is somewhat sensitive to it .",
    "the updated data are tabulated in table [ table1 ] .       in conclusion ,",
    "the global data have been examined and do not support the existence of @xmath10 contact interactions with the compositeness scale upto 815 tev . although the 199497 the nc dis data at hera favor a slightly non - zero contact interaction , the other data , especially the drell - yan data at the tevatron and the atomic parity violation measurement , severely constrain it . finally , the limits on the compositeness scale obtained in this analysis are significantly better than the results published by each individual experiment .",
    "we urge others to use the limits of @xmath8 obtained in this analysis .",
    "the above analysis can also be applied in a straight - forward fashion to other new physics such as @xmath47 and leptoquark models .",
