    "the neutrinoless double-@xmath4 ( @xmath0 ) decay is a process where an even - even nucleus @xmath5 transforms into its even - even neighbor @xmath6 with only two electrons emitted .",
    "the fact that the @xmath0 decay violates the total lepton number by two units makes it a probe sensitive to revealing the mysterious nature of massive neutrinos : this process occurs only if the neutrinos are majorana particles and the violation of total lepton number is possible .",
    "several other fundamental questions on neutrinos , including their absolute mass scale , mass spectrum hierarchy ( normal , inverted , or quasidegenerate ) , and the mechanism of masses generation , are expected to be clarified if one can possibly combine the results from this process and other neutrino experiments  @xcite . to date , no actual signal for the @xmath0 decay has been confirmed despite numerous experimental data released .",
    "recently , the most stringent lower limits on the half - lives have been reported by the kamland - zen collaboration  @xcite for @xmath7xe , @xmath8 yr ( 90% c.l . ) , and by the nemo-3 collaboration  @xcite for @xmath9nd , @xmath10 yr ( 90% c.l . ) .    in the @xmath0-decay mechanism of exchanging virtual majorana neutrinos ,",
    "the half - life @xmath11 is inversely proportional to an effective parameter @xmath12 related to neutrino masses , a kinematic phase - space factor @xmath13 , and the nuclear matrix element ( nme ) @xmath1 squared : @xmath14^{-1}=g_{0\\nu}\\ ; g_a^4\\;| m^{0\\nu}|^2\\;f(m_i , u_{ei}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] considering the two limiting cases of neutrino propagator ,",
    "@xmath15 the amplitude is proportional to the mass for a light neutrino , @xmath16 but inversely proportional to the mass for a heavy neutrino , @xmath17 note that @xmath18 is the momentum transferred by the neutrino and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are elements in the neutrino mixing matrix that mix light and heavy neutrinos , respectively . @xmath21 and @xmath22 are electron and nucleon masses , and the bare value @xmath23",
    "is used for the axial - vector coupling constant .",
    "given that the phase - space factor @xmath13 has been precisely determined  @xcite , an accurate knowledge of the nme @xmath1 is the key to connecting the experimental measurement with fundamental physics .",
    "the calculation of the nme requires the wave functions of initial and final nuclear states as well as the decay operator .",
    "previously , the nmes @xmath1 have been calculated within the framework of covariant density functional theory ( cdft )  @xcite , where the relativistic wave functions and the relativistic @xmath0-decay operator derived from weak interaction hamiltonian are used in the calculations .",
    "various nonrelativistic nuclear structure models have been applied as well .",
    "they include the configuration - interacting shell model ( cism )  @xcite , the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa )  @xcite , the projected hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( phfb ) model  @xcite , the interacting boson model ( ibm )  @xcite , and the nonrelativistic energy density functional ( edf ) theory  @xcite .",
    "in contrast with the cdft application , the @xmath0-decay operator has to be reduced to its nonrelativistic form in these calculations to be adapted to the nonrelativistic nuclear wave functions .",
    "therefore , the fully relativistic framework of cdft allows one to examine the validity of the nonrelativistic approximation and to reveal the relativistic effects in the nme by conducting comparative studies with the relativistic or nonrelativistic - reduced decay operators , respectively .",
    "previous studies based on beyond - mean - field cdft  @xcite have shown that the nonrelativistic decay operator is a good approximation to the full relativistic operator within the assumption of light - neutrino exchange .",
    "the goal of this paper is to generalize the calculations to the case with heavy - neutrino exchange and to present a comprehensive study on the effects of relativity and nucleon - nucleon short - range correlations ( srcs ) on the nme of @xmath0 decay .",
    "the calculations are based on nuclear wave functions in which the dynamic effects of particle - number and angular - momentum conservations as well as shape fluctuations are incorporated by the projection techniques and the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) , in full analogy to refs .",
    "the src corrections neglected in previous calculations of light - neutrino nme are now taken into account via a jastrow function using the argonne v18 parametrization  @xcite .",
    "in the framework of beyond - mean - field cdft , the nuclear many - body wave function is constructed by superposing a set of quantum - number projected nonorthogonal states around the equilibrium shape  @xcite , @xmath24 the deformation parameters @xmath25 are chosen as the generator coordinates in the gcm method so that the quadrupole axial deformation and its quantum fluctuations are considered .",

    "the projection operators @xmath27 s ( @xmath28 )  @xcite are responsible for restoring broken symmetries by projecting the reference wave functions onto states with good angular momenta @xmath29 and numbers ( @xmath30 ) of neutrons and protons .",
    "the coefficients @xmath31 are determined by solving the hill - wheeler - griffin equation  @xcite .",
    "the indices @xmath32 distinguish different nuclear states with energy @xmath33 .",
    "the @xmath0-decay operator is derived from the second - order weak hamiltonian with charge - exchange nucleonic and leptonic currents .",
    "it reads @xmath34 with @xmath35 fm .",
    "the neutrino potential @xmath36 for light - neutrino exchange is @xmath37 where @xmath38 corresponds to the energy of initial ( final ) nuclear state , and @xmath39 is the average energy of intermediate states . for heavy - neutrino exchange",
    "the neutrino potential is @xmath40 these potentials are obtained by taking the limiting forms of the neutrino propagator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : propagator ] ) .",
    "while the light - mass limit leads to a @xmath41 dependence in @xmath36 , the heavy - mass limit gives a constant .",
    "the charge - exchange nucleonic current is given by @xmath42 , with the vertex , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the isospin lowering operator . more details about the current operator @xmath45 as well as its nonrelativistic - reduced form can be found in refs .",

    "the neutron annihilation operators @xmath50 and proton creation operators @xmath51 are responsible for transforming two neutrons into protons .    to take into account the srcs of two interacting nucleons , the @xmath0-decay nme are calculated with nuclear wave functions modified by a jastrow correlation function  @xcite , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the distance of two nucleons .",
    "this is equivalent to modifying the decay operator , @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , the single integration over @xmath55 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nme ] ) now becomes twofold : @xmath56 note that the fourier transform of the correlation function , @xmath57 is used to treat the nme in the reciprocal spaces .",
    "the single - particle dirac equation is solved by expanding the wave functions in the three - dimensional harmonic oscillator basis with 12 major shells  @xcite .",
    "a zero - range force @xmath58 is implemented in the particle - particle channel .",
    "the pairing strength parameters @xmath59 are @xmath60 for neutrons and @xmath61 for protons , determined by reproducing the corresponding pairing gaps of separable finite - range pairing force  @xcite in @xmath9nd ( see fig .  1 of ref",
    ".  @xcite ) .",
    "note that only the like - particle pairing has been considered here . the isovector or isoscalar proton - neutron pairing is not included and the isospin symmetry is broken .",
    "on the one hand , the problem with isospin symmetry has been addressed in the qrpa  @xcite and the ibm calculations  @xcite , respectively .",
    "it is proposed that the ( partial ) restoration of isospin symmetry can be achieved by imposing the condition that the @xmath62 fermi matrix elements @xmath63 vanish .",
    "this has been realized by adjusting the value of the renormalization constant @xmath64 in qrpa  @xcite or by modifying the mapped fermion operators in ibm  @xcite .",
    "although the fermi matrix elements @xmath65 are considerably reduced , the restoration of isospin symmetry has only a limited effect on the total nmes .",
    "on the other hand , it has been known in the case of qrpa that the effect of the inclusion of the isoscalar pairing is significant .",
    "the renormalization parameter @xmath66 is crucial to the nme calculation , and its value is usually determined by the requirement that the calculated @xmath62 gamow - teller matrix elements @xmath67 reproduce their experimental values  @xcite .",
    "recently , this issue has been revisited by taking the isoscalar - pairing amplitude as a generator coordinate in gcm  @xcite .",

    "the @xmath0-decay nmes have been calculated within the framework of beyond - mean - field cdft by considering the underlying mechanisms of both light- and heavy - neutrino exchange .",
    "in particular , by investigating in detail the effects of relativity and srcs in @xmath9nd , we come to the following conclusions . ( 1 ) both effects are negligible for the light - neutrino nme , which indicates that the nonrelativistic reduction to the decay operator is a good approximation and the src correction can be safely neglected .",
    "( 2 ) the heavy - neutrino nme is more sensitive to both the relativistic correction and the inclusion of src than in the light - neutrino case .",
