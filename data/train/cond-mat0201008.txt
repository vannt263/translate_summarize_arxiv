    "ratchets have attracted a considerable recent interest because of their paradigmatic role as microscopic transport devices ( for review articles , see e.g. refs . ) .",
    "applications range from microscale electronics  including the photogalvanic effect,@xcite transport in quantum dots@xcite and antidot arrays@xcite  over josephson junctions @xcite and vortex matter@xcite to cell biology.@xcite at the same time , ratchets are of fundamental theoretical interest since they represent one of the simplest nonequilibrium systems .",
    "the analysis of ratchet systems reaches back quite some time before feynman drew the attention of a wide audience to such systems in his lectures where he discussed the possibility to employ ratchets as heat engines.@xcite subsequently , researches in ratchets have been progressing steadily , in parallel in different scientific communities , until the explosive outburst in theoretical and experimental interest in the 1990s @xcite had occurred .    in this paper",
    ", we report on the analytic progress in the study of the so called tilting ratchets , where the combination of an asymmetric static potential with an unbiased ac force and a coupling to a heat bath leads to current rectification .",
    "past theoretical studies of this ratchet type focused on the classical massless case @xcite and have revealed the _ current reversal _",
    "phenomenon , i.e. , the possibility that the direction of the rectified current reverses its direction when model parameters such as the frequency or amplitude of the ac current are changed .",
    "the inclusion of a finite mass of the particles has shown that it may give rise even to _ multiple _",
    "current reversals.@xcite further extensions accounted for the quantum nature of particles and of the bath .",
    "quantum fluctuations were found to provide an additional source of current reversals.@xcite    in essence , the direction and amplitude of the current turned out to be very sensitive to the various system parameters .",
    "while this dependence makes ratchets valuable for applications  such as devices that can separate particles of different species  it still lacks a satisfying theoretical understanding .",
    "analytic approaches can give insight into this problem .",
    "however , even the single - particle problem is already so complex that analytic approaches can be advanced only in limiting cases , such as the adiabatic limit@xcite or the deterministic limit.@xcite    in our paper we develop a perturbative approach valid for weak ratchet potentials and weak driving forces , which covers a wide range of practical applications . within this perturbative approach",
    "we are able to capture all prominent phenomena including multiple current reversals .",
    "this approach provides a unified framework for deriving and understanding the dependence of the rectified current on the particle mass , temperature , friction coefficient , and frequency of the driving force .",
    "we pay particular attention to the role of inertial effects and show that they lead to a substantial current enhancement even in the high - temperature limit .    in sec .",

    "following caldeira and leggett,@xcite we couple the particle linearly to a bath of harmonic oscillators at temperature @xmath4 .",
    "this bath simultaneously provides friction and a fluctuating force for the particle . for simplicity , we assume a linear spectral distribution of these oscillators , giving rise to ohmic dissipation . in the classical limit ,",
