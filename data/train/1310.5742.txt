    "the study and characterization of magnetic systems on regular @xmath0-dimensional lattices , both experimentally and theoretically , has been well established during the last century ( see , for instance , the book series edited by domb and green , and also edited by domb and lebowitz , on _ phase transitions and critical phenomena_@xcite ) . although the transition temperatures are model dependent and non - universal , the critical exponents are known to be universal . in general , the universality class depends on the spatial lattice dimension @xmath0 , on the number of components @xmath1 ( and symmetry ) of the order parameter , and on the range of interactions .",
    "the agreement between theory and experimental results on real compounds has been reported to be excellent in this regard .",
    "more recently , there has been a great deal of interest in studying networks , which are different from the regular crystalline bravais lattices@xcite .",
    "the study of such complex lattices , also called scale - free networks , has been mainly motivated by social organizations and computers connectivities@xcite , among others .",
    "it has been possible to recognize , in this way , networks ranging from networks in nature to networks of people as well .",
    "thus , it turns out quite interesting to understand the behavior of a magnetic system on such networks and also on random graphs . despite being theoretical by now , this will certainly trigger the possibility of synthesizing experimental realizations of materials governed by random - lattices sites . under this theoretical point of view",
    ", the magnetic model can be defined by usual spin interactions , where each spin is located on the sites of a complex lattice .",
    "the main questions that arise concern the possible existence of a first- or second - order ( critical or multicritical ) phase transition , and in the case of a second - order transition , the corresponding universality class of the model .",
    "in this brief review we will consider complex lattices based on the voronoi - delauny ( vd ) tessellation@xcite , barabsi - albert ( ba)@xcite , appolonian ( ap)@xcite , and small - world ( sw)@xcite networks , and erds - rnyi ( er)@xcite random graphs . the magnetic models applied to these networks are the ising , potts and blume - capel models , among others . in the next section",
    ", a short introduction of the hamiltonian models and lattices will be presented . in the following sections we will give a brief summary of what has been done on each network and random graphs and , in the final section",
    ", we will present a discussion and a summary of the results .",
    "the ising and blume - capel models can be defined by the following hamiltonian @xmath2 where the first sum is over nearest - neighbors on a @xmath0-dimensional lattice with @xmath3 sites , @xmath4 is the state of a spin-@xmath5 with components @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the crystal field .",
    "the general spin-@xmath5 simple ising model is recovered when @xmath8 .",
    "there is no transition for the one - dimensional model and in the two and three dimensions the universality class is defined by the exponents given in tab .",
    "[ tabex ] .",
    ".[tabex ] order of transition and critical exponents for the ising and potts models on regular lattices . in two dimensions",
    "we have the exact results and in three dimensions the values come from monte carlo simulations ( see , for instance , reference@xcite ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     on the other hand , the @xmath9-state potts model can be written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the kronecker delta function and now @xmath12 . again , no transition is observed for the one - dimensional model . in two dimensions , which is the case treated in this work ,",
    "the universality class is also given in tab .",
    "[ tabex ] for @xmath13 ( for @xmath14 it corresponds to the spin-@xmath15 ising model ) . for @xmath16",
    "a first - order transition takes place .",
    "the above models have also been treated in complex lattices . some of these complex lattices will be briefly described below .",
    "the appolonian network is composed of @xmath17 nodes , where @xmath1 is the generation number and @xmath3 the node number @xcite . on these ap structures",
    "we can introduce a disorder , in such a way that we redirect a fraction @xmath18 of the links .",
    "this redirecting results in a directed network , preserving the outgoing node of the redirected link but changing the incoming node . when @xmath19 we have the standard ap networks , while for @xmath20 we have something similar to random networks @xcite . in this procedure of the redirecting links , the number of outgoing links of each node is preserved even when @xmath20 and the network still have hubs that are the most influent nodes .",
    "these networks display a scale - free degree distribution and a hierarchical structure . in the undirected case there",
    "exists the reciprocity of redirected link .      to generate the directed sw networks @xcite we use a square grid and other irregular triangular .",
    "the disorder introduced here is identical to the procedure used on ap network cited above for both cases directed and undirected network .",
    "an er random graph is formed by a set of @xmath3 vertices ( sites ) connected by @xmath21 links ( bonds)@xcite . with a probability @xmath18 a given pair of sites is connected by a bond type @xmath22 .",
    "the connectivity of a site is defined as the total number of bonds connected to it , like @xmath23 , where @xmath24 if there is a link between the sites @xmath25 and @xmath26 and @xmath27 otherwise .",
    "random graphs are completely characterized by the mean number of bonds per site , or the average connectivity @xmath28 .",
    "these links can be directed or undirected as well .      in the directed ba network ,",
    "each new site added to the network selects ( a preferential attachment proportional to the number of previous selections ) , with connectivity @xmath29 , already existing sites or nodes as neighbors influencing it ; the newly added site does not influence these neighbors . in the case of the undirected ba network",
    ", the newly added spin does influence these neighbors .      in the undirected vd",
    "random lattice the construction of the lattice obey the following procedure : for each point in a given set of points in a plane , we determine the polygonal cell that contains the region of space nearest to that point than any other .",
    "two cells are considered neighbors when they possess an extremity in common ( voronoi tessellation ) . from this voronoi tessellation",
    ", we can obtain the dual lattice , or triangulation of delaunay , by the following procedure .",
    "(i ) when we have two neighbor cells , a link is placed between the two points located in the cells .",
    "(ii ) from the links , we obtain the triangulation of space that is called the delaunay lattice .",
    "(iii ) the delaunay lattice is dual to the voronoi tessellation in the sense that its points correspond to cells , links to edges and triangles to the vertices of the voronoi tessellation .",
    "the directed vd random lattices is constructed in the same way as the directed sw network .",
    "the ising model has been studied on the triangular appolonian networks with constant exchange interaction @xmath30 @xcite and with node - dependent interaction constants @xmath31 @xcite . the corresponding thermodynamic and magnetic properties",
    "have been obtained by formulating the problem in terms of transfer matrices . in both cases",
    "the results show no evidence of any phase transition either for the ferromagnetic or the antiferromagnetic model , as well as for short or long ranged interactions",
    ". quenched random models , including ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic bond dilution and ising spin glasses have already been considered @xcite . in this case the ordered phases persist up to infinite temperature over the entire range of disorder .",
    "the @xmath9-state potts model has been studied on appolonian networks by using monte carlo simulations and transfer matrix techniques@xcite . in this case , as for the spin-@xmath15 ising model , no transition has been detected for any value of @xmath9 .",
    "the spin-@xmath15 and spin-@xmath32 ising model have been studied on directed and undirected erds - rnyi random graphs with different coordination numbers by using monte carlo simulations@xcite . for spin-@xmath15 ,",
    "the model exhibits a critical temperature , below which there is a spontaneous magnetization , with mean - field exponents .",
    "although the critical temperature depends on being directed or undirected graphs , the critical exponents are the same as the mean - field ones for both cases .",
    "the same qualitative results are also obtained for the spin-@xmath32 model . however , in this case , one has a first - order phase transition instead .",
    "these results are in agreement with those obtained for a nonequilibrium model defined on the same random erds - rnyi lattices @xcite ( in this case , according to the grinstein , jayaprakash and he criterion @xcite , non - nequilibrium and equilibrium models that present up - down symmetry may belong to the same universality class ) .",

    "this means in fact that at all finite temperatures the magnetization eventually vanishes , i.e. , no ferromagnetism is present .",

    "sumuor and lima @xcite have studied the critical behavior of ising and potts models on semi - directed barabsi - albert network ( sdba ) , recently studied by sumour and radwan @xcite , where now the number @xmath41 of nodes with @xmath42 links each decays as @xmath43 and the exponent @xmath44 decreases from @xmath45 to @xmath38 for increasing @xmath46 , where @xmath46 is the number of old nodes which a new node added to the network selects to be connected with . this behavior is totally different from @xmath47 and @xmath48 scale free networks where @xmath49 is universal , i.e. , independent of @xmath46 . for both ising and potts model",
    "the results showed no phase transition , in agreement with references@xcite , and a curie temperature to diverge at positive temperatures @xmath50 by a vogel - fulcher law , with @xmath50 increasing logarithmically with network size @xmath3 .",

    "it has been shown that any non - zero value of @xmath52 destroys the finite - temperature transition in the thermodynamic limit@xcite .",
    "the results are different when the small - world interactions are independent of the length ( @xmath53 ) , where a finite - temperature phase transition is observed @xcite with critical exponents smaller than the corresponding ones for the two - dimensional ising model .",
    "the two- @xcite and three - dimensional spin-@xmath15 model have also been treated by monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that in the thermodynamic limit the phase transition has a mean - field character .",
    "on the other hand , the two - dimensional model has been extended for greater values of spin , namely spin-@xmath32 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 on directed small - world networks ( dsw ) @xcite . in the dsw network @xcite ,",
