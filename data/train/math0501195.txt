    "since witten s proof of the positive mass theorem  @xcite , spinors have been a valuable tool for the analysis of asymptotically flat manifolds ; see for example  @xcite or the integral estimates of riemannian curvature  @xcite .",
    "these last estimates have the disadvantage that they involve the isoperimetric constant , which depends on the geometry in the interior ( i.e.  away from the asymptotic end ) and is therefore in most situations not known . in order to get curvature estimates which do not involve the isoperimetric constant , one needs better control of the witten spinor .",
    "this was our motivation for looking at weighted integral norms of the witten spinor . in order to concentrate on the role of the interior geometry",
    ", we chose the geometry in the asymptotic end as simple as possible : as the schwarzschild metric .",
    "thus the question under consideration is to which extent the unknown interior geometry can affect the behavior of the witten spinor in the asymptotic end . in this paper",
    ", we quantify this effect by an integral inequality .",
    "we find that the effect of the interior geometry on a suitable weighted @xmath0-norm is described purely in terms of the lowest eigenvalue of the square of the dirac operator on a conformal compactification of  @xmath2 .    to be more specific",
    ", we now describe the problem and our main results in the most familiar and physically most interesting case of dimension three .",
    "thus let  @xmath3 be a complete riemannian manifold of non - negative scalar curvature which is asymptotically schwarzschild , i.e.  the metric in the asymptotic end is @xmath4 where  @xmath5 is the euclidean metric , and  @xmath6 is the euclidean norm of  @xmath7 .",
    "the witten spinor is a solution of the massless dirac equation which at infinity goes over to a constant spinor  @xmath8 with  @xmath9 .",
    "more precisely , a witten spinor  @xmath10 has the following asymptotics at infinity , @xmath11 this asymptotics is used in  @xcite for the proof of the positive mass theorem . in order to get an estimate of the error term , we point compactify the manifold with a conformal transformation of the form    @xmath12 in such a way that the geometry of  @xmath13 remains unchanged",
    ", the scalar curvature stays non - negative , and the compactification of the asymptotic end is isometric to a cap  @xmath14 of a sphere of radius  @xmath15 ( for an illustrating example see figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "then the compactification  @xmath16 is a closed manifold of non - negative scalar curvature , and it is clear from the lichnerowicz - weitzenbck formula that the square of the dirac operator on  @xmath17 is positive , @xmath18 . since the scalar curvature is strictly positive in the spherical cap , we even know that the lowest eigenvalue is non - zero , @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , using methods of spin geometry , it is possible under various geometric conditions ( for example involving only scalar curvature ) to bound the lowest eigenvalue of  @xmath20 from below ( see e.g.  @xcite )",
    ". then the following inequality gives a detailed estimate of the witten spinor .",
    "[ thmintro ] there is a constant  @xmath21 independent of the geometry of  @xmath13 such that @xmath22    in the course of proving this theorem , we derive an identity involving witten spinors , which is of some interest in its own , as we now explain .",
    "we choose an orthonormal basis  @xmath23 of the spinors at infinity and consider the corresponding family  @xmath24 of witten spinors , @xmath25 we let  @xmath26 and  @xmath27 be the green s functions of the square of the dirac operator on  @xmath17 and the sphere  @xmath28 , respectively , and denote their integral kernels by  @xmath29 and  @xmath30 .",
    "the next theorem expresses the weighted @xmath0-norms of the witten spinors  ( [ fwitten ] ) in terms of the difference of these integral kernels , with an explicit error term .",
    "[ thmintro2 ] the witten spinors satisfy for sufficiently large  @xmath31 the identity @xmath32 where  @xmath33 is the lebesgue measure on  @xmath34 . here we assume that the asymptotic end  @xmath35 is diffeomorphic to  @xmath36 and work in the corresponding chart .",
    "this _ equality _ clearly gives finer information than the inequality of theorem  [ thmintro ] .",
    "the interesting point is that the interior geometry enters only via the green s function  @xmath26 .",
    "we learn that the influence of the interior geometry on the weighted  @xmath0-norm is described precisely by the behavior of  @xmath37 as  @xmath38 .    in this paper , we prove the analog of theorem  [ thmintro ] and theorem  [ thmintro2 ] in general dimension . for the proof we work as in  @xcite with the spinor operator , which is composed of a basis of witten spinors  ( [ fwitten ] ) .",
    "our first step is to get a connection between the conformally transformed spinor operator and a quadratic expression in the dirac green s function on  @xmath17 ( see section  [ sec3 ] ) . in section  [ sec4 ] we find that , after subtracting suitable counter terms , we can integrate this expression over  @xmath17 to obtain the green s function  @xmath26 of the square of the dirac operator minus suitable counter terms .",
    "then our task becomes to analyze the behavior of  @xmath26 near the pole  @xmath39 of the spherical cap .",
    "this is done in section  [ sec5 ] , where we estimate the difference of  @xmath26 and the corresponding green s function on the sphere using sobolev techniques . in section  [ secgfs ] ,",
    "we compute the green s functions on the sphere explicitly .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec7 ] we combine the results of sections  [ sec3 ] and  [ sec4 ] to obtain an identity for an integral of the trace of the spinor operator ( theorem  [ thmw1 ] ) . using a positivity argument together with the estimates of sections  [ sec5 ] and  [ secgfs ]",
    ", we then conclude our main results ( corollary  [ corend ] , theorem  [ thmspop ] and corollary  [ thmwitten ] ) .",
    "we finally remark that our methods work similarly also for harmonically flat manifolds ( see  @xcite for the definition ) , except for lemma  [ partialwave ] , where an angular dependence of the function  @xmath40 would lead to a `` mixing '' of the angular momentum modes , making the situation more complicated .",
    "since we did not find a simple argument to overcome this problem , we here restrict attention to a schwarzschild end . a generalization to",
    "harmonically flat manifolds would be desirable in view of the fact that the metric of every asymptotically flat manifold can be made harmonically flat by an arbitrarily small perturbation  @xcite .",
    "let  @xmath41 be a complete riemannian manifold of dimension  @xmath42 with non - negative scalar curvature . for simplicity , we assume that the manifold has one asymptotic end which is isometric to schwarzschild . by rescaling",

    "unfortunately , the function  @xmath61 is not smooth at  @xmath65 .",
    "more precisely , a short calculation shows that the first derivative of  @xmath61 makes a negative jump , i.e. @xmath71 as a consequence , the scalar curvature  @xmath72 corresponding to  @xmath68 , given by the formula @xmath73 ( where  @xmath74 is the laplacian in  @xmath48 ) is positive at  @xmath65 in the distributional sense . by mollifying  @xmath75 in a small neighborhood of  @xmath65 we can thus arrange that  @xmath76 .",
