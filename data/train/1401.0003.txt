    "in recent years , the advent of new millimeter ( mm ) and submillimeter ( submm ) facilities , such as the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) , with unprecedented sensitivity and frequency coverage , has improved the detectability of cool gas in high - redshift star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite reported two chance detections of submm galaxies ( smgs , * ? ? ? * for a review ) in [ c  ii ] 158-@xmath4 line emission during 870-@xmath4 continuum follow - up observations of 126 smgs using alma , which places the first constraint on the [ c  ii ] luminosity function at @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , @xcite made the deepest unlensed number counts of smgs using sources incidentally detected in the same fields of view ( fovs ) toward near - infrared - selected star - forming galaxies at @xmath17 .",
    "such `` incidental '' searches for high-@xmath18 star - forming galaxies , especially in emission lines , offer a unique opportunity to investigate the line luminosity functions or cool gas mass functions , which are important for constraining galaxy formation models .    here",
    "we report the serendipitous detection of a dusty starburst galaxy , alma  j010748.3@xmath0173028 ( hereafter alma - j0107 ) , with a significant emission line at 99.75 ghz , which is likely a redshifted @xmath6co line . at this position",
    ", we find a hard x - ray source , which strongly suggests the presence of a buried active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",

    "alma 3-mm and 880-@xmath4 observations toward vv114 ( program i d : 2011.0.00467.s ) were conducted using the compact configuration in november 2011 and the extended configuration in may 2012 ( 3-mm observation only ) .",
    "the correlator was configured to cover 98.53102.35 ghz/110.77113.90 ghz ( 3  mm ) and 323.51327.25 ghz/335.68339.31 ghz ( 880  @xmath4 ) with a 0.488 mhz resolution . the 3-mm and 880-@xmath4 primary beam sizes are @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively ; for the 880-@xmath4 observations , we mosaicked seven pointings to compensate for the small fov of band 7 . at both 3 mm and 880 @xmath4 , uranus ,",
    "j1924@xmath0292 , and j0132@xmath0169 ( @xmath25 away from vv114 ) were used to calibrate the absolute flux , bandpass , and complex gain , respectively .",
    "we used casa @xcite to calibrate the visibility data and to image them with a robust weighting of 0.5 .",
    "note that we made the continuum images using only spectral channels that are free from @xmath6co emission from vv114 , which leaves 6.7-ghz and 6.6-ghz bandwidths at 3 mm and 880 @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "we ` clean`ed the resulting dirty images down to the 1@xmath1 level .",
    "the synthesized beam sizes at 3  mm and 880  @xmath4 are @xmath26 ( pa = @xmath27 ) and @xmath28 ( pa = @xmath29 ) , respectively .",
    "the resulting rms noise levels at 3 mm before correcting for primary beam attenuation were 0.92 mjy  beam@xmath3 for a cube with a resolution of 30 km s@xmath3 and 50 @xmath30jy  beam@xmath3 for the continuum image .",
    "the 880-@xmath4 noise levels for a 30 km  s@xmath3 resolution cube and continuum are 1.5 mjy  beam@xmath3 and 0.11 mjy  beam@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the flux calibration accuracies in both bands are estimated to be 10% .",
    "we serendipitously detect a 13@xmath1 line - emitting object , alma - j0107 , at 99.753 ghz at @xmath31 , as shown in figure  [ fig : almaimage ] .",
    "the image is marginally resolved , and the beam - deconvolved source size measured using a casa task ` imfit ` is @xmath32 , although no velocity structure is found .",

    "moreover , we find no emission line feature in the other spectral windows of bands 3 and 7 at this position .",
    "thus , it is natural to consider a redshifted emission line , especially a @xmath6co line , arising from a background galaxy .",
    "we list the possible redshifts , as well as the corresponding co luminosities and molecular masses , for up to the @xmath375 transitions of @xmath6co in table  [ table : id ] .",

    "to obtain rough estimates of the redshift , we use four template spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of well - studied starburst galaxies : arp  220 , m82 @xcite , smm  j2135@xmath00102 @xcite , and a composite of radio - identified smgs @xcite",

    "the fir luminosity , @xmath6513 , is mostly insensitive to the redshift .",
    "the constraint could become tighter when we use the irac photometry in addition to the submm to radio data , although the use of irac data should be considered cautiously because irac observes the rest - frame optical component , which depends strongly on the stellar population model .",
    "the dashed curves in the @xmath58 plot of figure  [ fig : photoz]a show the minimum @xmath58 values from sed fits using the constraints at 3.6  @xmath4 and 4.5  @xmath4 .",

    "however , the intrinsic properties of the agn ( e.g. , the bolometric luminosity ) depend strongly on the redshift , although the fir luminosity and molecular mass are rather insensitive to the redshift .",

    "this serendipitous detection of a co - emitting galaxy demonstrates that alma is capable of identifying an emission - line galaxy such as alma - j0107 .",
