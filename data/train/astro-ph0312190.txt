    "investigating cosmic ray airshowers induced by extremely high energy cosmic rays ( ehecrs , @xmath2 ) remains an area of intense interest because of an apparent paradox posed by the onset of the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) effect  @xcite .",
    "as is well known , the paradox is that @xmath3 events have been detected apparently having @xmath4 but with no currently obvious astrophysical source within the local gzk sphere defined by the @xmath5 mpc distance over which cosmic ray protons lose a substantial fraction of their initial energy through interactions with cmb photons  @xcite . due to this small number of events ,",
    "open questions include the existence of statistically significant clustering / anisotropy , correlations with known astrophysical source distributions ( e.g. , qsos ) , the composition / charge of the primaries , and whether the production mechanism is top - down or bottom - up .",
    "this presentation summarizes the analytical approach and results contained in two papers  @xcite . because of the three page limit imposed for the taup03 conference proceedings , this paper is necessarily abbreviated , informal , and contains only a few references .",
    "however , further details concerning methodology , additional figures and tables , and more complete bibliographies can be found in our two papers mentioned above .",
    "for this study , we use the agasa data for airshowers with estimated energies @xmath6 and zenith angles @xmath7 contained in reference  @xcite .",
    "the results we obtain are based on applying statistical estimators to monte carlo simulations of isotropically - distributed arrival directions convolved with the observed agasa detector acceptance .",
    "the distribution of angular pair separations is analyzed with the landy - szalay ( ls ) two point angular correlation function , @xmath8 where the `` d '' and `` r '' refer to a single angular position of an event in the data or random catalogs , respectively , so that `` dd '' represents a pair separation between two events in the data , etc .",
    "values of @xmath9 then indicate pair correlations beyond those expected in uncorrelated distributions ( with a mc - derived significance ) .",
    "figure  [ corfcn_2pt5 ] shows the results for bin widths of @xmath10 where the existence of an excess number of pairs in the first bin over that expected from random projection is at greater than the @xmath11 level .     bin widths . ]",
    "clustering probabilities are estimated directly from the simulations by utilizing a counting scheme that identifies _ distinct _ multiplet configurations ( e.g. , doublets , triplets , etc . )",
    "instead of counting just pairs within a specified opening ( or correlation ) angle .",
    "the reason for this is that higher order multiplets , such as a triplet , generally have a lower probability for random occurrence than does the presence of the same number of distinct pairs .",
    "this can be seen from figure  [ jp_60_72 ] that shows the joint inclusive probability contours for various doublet - triplet configurations .",
    "the associated ls cross correlation function is @xmath12 where the subscripts refer to the two samples being cross correlated , and values of @xmath13 indicate the two samples are correlated ( with a mc - derived significance ) .",
    "equation ( 2 ) is used to investigate whether the agasa sample can be separated into statistically uncorrelated distributions partitioned by energy , and to search for correlations between the agasa sample and bl lacertae , blazars , and abell clusters of galaxies .",
    "avoiding the pitfalls in cross correlating cosmic ray arrival directions with catalogs of astrophysical objects requires accounting for + 1 .",
    "selection effects such as absorption at low galactic latitudes , + 2 . catalog completeness and source densities , + 3 .",
    "intrinsic clustering / correlations between the candidate _ sources _ ,",
    "+ many of the previously published studies finding correlations with various types of objects have not fully considered these points . in our study",
    ", we have attempted to be as rigorous as possible .     partition . ]",
    "our results can be summarized as follows : + 1 .",
    "angular correlations exist on @xmath14 scales at the @xmath15 level ( mc prob .",
    "@xmath16 ) with no departures from homogeneity on scales @xmath17 , + 2 . partitioning the agasa sample by energy yields three apparently uncorrelated groups with energies @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , + 3 . from figure  [ sgb_part ]",
    ", the partition with @xmath19 appears to be preferentially aligned with the supergalactic equatorial plane ( i.e. , in a plane containing a large fraction of galaxies within our local supercluster ) at the @xmath21 mc prob .",
    "level ; the other two energy partitions are consistent with isotropic distributions , + 4 .",
    "none of the partitions exhibits a statistically significant correlation with bl lacertae or blazar sky ( angular ) positions drawn from three recent catalogs ( veron & veron - cetty , 2002 ; padovani _ et al_. , 1999 ; and landt _ et al_. , 2001 ) , + 5 .",
    "the subset of events within the @xmath22 partition having galactic latitudes @xmath23 appears to be correlated with @xmath24 , @xmath25 abell clusters of galaxies on angular scales of @xmath26 at greater than the 99% confidence level ( the maximum positive correlation appears between @xmath27  ( see figure  [ ag_abell_xcor ] ) .",
    "we have no pretensions of having achieved definitive results . with the small data sample and low statistics ,",
    "the results could change considerably or disappear with only a few additional events .",
    "however , the methodology is robust , and the internal consistency of the implied scenario is somewhat remarkable : the mid - energy distribution ends at approximately the gzk `` cutoff '' energy , and is apparently correlated with the luminous matter distribution in the local supercluster but not that beyond .",
    "the high - energy partition may be isotropically distributed , appears uncorrelated with the matter distribution of the local supercluster , but may be correlated with the matter distribution outside the local supercluster to distances as great as @xmath28 .",
    "note that testing for energy partitions is independent of the subsequent cross correlation with other distributions . finally , penalty factors have been considered and will be discussed in the forthcoming paper .",
