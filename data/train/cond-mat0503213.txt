    "functional methods in modern statistical physics represent one of the most powerful tools for the study both of equilibrium and dynamical properties ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a great amount of statistical field theories known in the literature are based of the hubbard - stratonovich transformation @xcite , proposed in the 50ies . nearly at the same time",
    "another method - so - called collective variables ( cv ) method - that allows in a explicit way to construct a functional representation for many - particle interacting systems was developed @xcite and applied for the description of charged particle systems , in particular , to the calculation of the configurational integral of the coulomb systems .",
    "the idea of this method was based on : ( i ) the concept of collective coordinates being appropriate for the physics of system considered ( see , for instance , @xcite ) , and ( ii ) the integral equality allowing to derive an exact functional representation for the configurational boltzmann factor .",
    "later the cv methods was successfully developed for the description of classical many - particle systems @xcite and for the phase transition theory @xcite .",
    "one more functional approach , the mesoscopic field theory , was recently developed for the study of phase transitions in ionic fluids @xcite .",
    "one of the goals of this paper is to reconsider the cv method from the point of view of the statistical field theory and to compare the results obtained with those found recently by one of us by means of the ksshe ( kac - siegert - stratonovich - hubbard - edwards ) theory @xcite .",
    "we formulate the method of cv in real space and consider a one - component continuous model consisting of hard spheres interacting through additive pair potentials .",
    "the expression for the functional of the grand partition function is derived and the cv action that depends upon two scalar fields - field @xmath0 connected to the number density of particles and field @xmath1 conjugate to @xmath0 - is calculated .",
    "we study correlations between these fields as well as their relations to the density and energy correlations of the fluid .",
    "the grand partition function of the model is evaluated in a systematic way using a well - known method of statistical field theory , namely the so - called loop expansion .",
    "it consists in expanding functionally the action @xmath2 around a saddle point , so that the lowest order ( zero loop ) approximation defines the mean - field ( mf ) level of the theory and the first order loop expressions correspond to the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "recently @xcite this technique was applied to the action obtained within the framework of the ksshe theory . in this paper",
    "we perform a two - loop expansion of the pressure and the free energy of the homogeneous fluid which yields a new type of approximation which we plan to test in our future work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2 , starting from the hamiltonian , we introduce the two different functional representations of the grand partition function based on the ksshe and cv methods . here",
    "we also enter several types of statistical field averages that are important in the further part of the paper . in section",
    "3 we introduce the cv and ksshe field correlation functions , establish links between them as well as their relation to the density correlation functions of the fluid .",
    "the mf level of the ksshe and cv field theories is formulated in section  4 .",
    "section  5 is devoted to the loop expansion of the grand potential .",
    "the pressure and the free energy of the homogeneous fluid are obtained in the two - loop approximation in section  6 .",
    "we conclude with some final remarks in section  7 .",

    "we denote by @xmath13 the domain of volume @xmath14 occupied by the molecules of the fluid .",
    "the fluid is at equilibrium in the grand canonical ( gc ) ensemble and we denote by @xmath15 the inverse temperature ( @xmath16 is the boltzmann constant ) and @xmath17 is the chemical potential .",
    "in addition the particles are subject to an external potential @xmath18 and we will denote by @xmath19 the dimensionless local chemical potential",
