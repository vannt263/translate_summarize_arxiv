    "the squeezing of the quantum fluctuations is one of the most fundamental manifestations of the heisenberg uncertainty relation , which is among the most important principles of quantum mechanics .",
    "a long time ago , great effort has been paid to squeezing of the radiation field due to its strong application in the optical communication  @xcite and weak signal detections  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , it was established the relationship between the squeezing of the atoms and that of the radiation field  @xcite and the possibility of squeezed atoms to radiate a squeezed field  @xcite . moreover",
    ", much attention has been devoted to atomic spin squeezing  @xcite .",
    "spin squeezed states  @xcite are quantum correlated states with reduced fluctuations in one of the collective components .",
    "spin squeezed states offer an interesting possibility for reducing quantum noise in precision measurements  @xcite , with potentially possible applications in ultra - precise spectroscopy , atomic interferometers and high precision atomic clocks  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it was found that spin squeezing is closely related to a key ingredient in quantum information theory and implies quantum entanglement  @xcite .",
    "as there are various kinds of entanglement , a question arises : what kind of entanglement does spin squeezing imply ? in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been found that , for a two - qubit symmetric state , spin squeezing is equivalent to its bipartite entanglement , i.e. , spin squeezing implies bipartite entanglement and vice versa .",
    "wang and sanders  @xcite , presented a generalization of the results of ref .",
    "@xcite to the multiqubit case , where the authors showed that spin squeezing implies pairwise entanglement for arbitrary symmetric multiqubit states .",
    "more quantitatively , for spin states with a certain parity , if a state is spin squeezed according to the definition for kitagawa and ueda  @xcite , a quantitative relation is obtained between the spin squeezing parameter and the concurrence  @xcite , quantifying the entanglement of two half - spin particles  @xcite .",
    "the close relation between the entanglement and spin squeezing enhances the importance of spin squeezing which motivate us to explore the role of kerr medium  @xcite and the nonlinear binomial state on the spin squeezing and entanglement .",
    "a binomial state is one of the important nonclassical states of light which has attracted much attention in the field of quantum optics in the last few decades , see for example  @xcite .",
    "this , in fact , is due to the importance of these states which have been experimentally produced and characterized .",
    "this state is regarded as one of the intermediate states of the coherent state  @xcite .",
    "it can be simply produced from the action of a single mode squeeze operator on the state @xmath1",

    "it also represents a linear combination from the number states with coefficients chosen such that the photon counting probability distribution is the binomial distribution with mean @xmath3 , where @xmath4 .",
    "the scope of this communication is to employ the spin squeezing and quantum entropy to elucidate entanglement for two - atom system prepared initially in bell - state interacting with single cavity field prepared initially in a binomial state .",
    "we introduce our hamiltonian model and give exact expressions for the full wave function of the atomic bell - state and field systems , shedding light on the important question of the relation between spin squeezing and quantum entropy behaviors .",
    "we also examine the evolution of the quasiprobability distribution husimi @xmath0-function for the model under consideration . with the help of the quasiprobability distribution ,",
    "one gains further insight into the mechanism of the interaction of the model subsystems . in the language of quantum information theory a definition of spin squeezing",
    "is presented for this system .",
    "the utility of the definition is illustrated by examining spin squeezing from the point of view of quatum information theory for the present system .",

    "this short period of revival is followed by a long period of collapse .",
    "the period of revival starts longer for one period of time with high amplitude to become wider with smaller amplitude as time goes .",
    "this is because the width and heights of the revivals belonging to the different series of eigenvalues are different .",
    "furthermore , as we increase the detuning parameter @xmath131 from its value @xmath132 ( resonance case ) , the overlap of revivals noticeably decreases with the increase in @xmath131 . also , the periods of oscillations within the revival decrease with the increase in the detuning parameter @xmath131 . for the population , @xmath125 ,",

    "when we turn our attention to the role that spin squeezing parametres play to discover entanglement properties , we can realize that the behaviors of both squeezing parameter @xmath94 and atomic entropy @xmath124 are equivalent , i.e. , entanglemet implies spin squeezing and vice versa .",
    "this can be understood as follows : quantum entropy @xmath124 oscillates when @xmath94 exhibits oscillations with same periods of time .    ]     ]    furthermore , the function @xmath124 goes to its maximum when @xmath94 shows oscillations around very small value ( between 0.45 and 0.5 ) of its maximum and when @xmath95 shows collapse equal to its maximum , while @xmath124 reaches its minimum when squeezing occurs .",
    "this behavior occurs periodically for both @xmath124 and @xmath94 .",

    "in this case the same general behavior ( with periods shift to right when @xmath136 ) is noticed . additionally , the oscillations become more dense with reduced maximum of @xmath124 corresponding to the increase of the oscillation interval of @xmath94 ( between 0.4 and 0.5 and become longer as @xmath131 increase ) and when some intervals of collapse begin to appear .",
    "+ the surprising and very interesting is the effect of the nonlinear medium individually and in the presence of the detuning parameter @xmath131 .     ]    to examine the effect of these mentioned parameters , we recall figures ( 3 - 5 ) .",
    "these figures have been pictured by the setting of different values of the parameter @xmath137 individually and in the presence of the detuning parameter @xmath131 .",
    "it is easy to see the change in figures shape where the standard behavior was changed completely . for a weak kerr medium such that @xmath138 , our reference function , @xmath139 , shows behavior similar to the modified jayned - cumming model with kerr medium  @xcite accompanied with reduced amplitude of oscillations .",
    ", @xmath140    furthermore , the population @xmath139 and spin squeezing parameter @xmath95 oscillate periodically with fixed periods are equivalent but @xmath94 does not",
    ". a quick look at the squeezing parameter @xmath94 one can realize easily that it oscillates rapidly .",
    "the oscillations overlap for a period of time ( except for some instances ) to become dense to show periodically wave packets of gaussian envelope with amplitude decreases as time develops .",
    "the more the gaussian - packet - envelope amplitude decreases the more the entropy increases , i.e. , stronger entanglement can be showed , see figure 3 .",
    "this behavior becomes more clear when we consider the detuning parameter in our numerical computations , see figure 5 .     ]    furthermore , when the nonlinear medium becomes stronger , @xmath125 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 show chaotic behavior with no indications of revivals or any other regular structure .",
    "this is accompanied with change in the entropy maximum from slow to rapid increase as @xmath137 increases with time develops ( see fig .",
    "this behavior is dominant without or with high values of @xmath131 . + with the increase of @xmath141 and @xmath12 , such that @xmath142 , and @xmath143 , i.e. ; on increasing the average number @xmath3 of photon , the oscillations of squeezing parametres @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath125 and quantum entropy @xmath124 becomes more dense .",
    "this means that every two neighbor overlapping revivals start to overlap again .",
    "this is because with larger mean photon @xmath3 , these functions have bigger values with time evolution , which causes dense oscillations of the cavity field parametres . in other words , there are more revival series since more eigenvalues can be found in this model",
    ". however , the same behavior , we saw before for @xmath129 , is seen again except for the envelope width becomes wider which resulted in fewer packets of oscillation appear in the same period of time , see figure 6 and 7 .",
    "it is worth to note that each revival series of oscillations corresponds to a beat frequency .",
    "moreover , on weak kerr medium the relation between the atomic entropy and spin squeezing parametres seems more complicated . in this case",
    "all of them oscillate with no indications of revivals or any other regular structure where the gaussian envelope completely disappears .",
    "the effect of strong kerr medium individually and with the coexistence of small detuning exhibits behavior similar to that when @xmath129 .    at the end we are going to focus our attention on the representation of the field in phase space which provides some aspects of the field dynamics .",

    "1 . from figure 8a , it is clear that the state of the field is a squeezed state , since the husimi @xmath0-function has different widths in the @xmath148 and @xmath149 directions . on the other hand ,",
    "the squeezing is generated by the nonlinearity inherent to the system by the binomial state .",
    "this can be explained in terms of a superposition of different numbers of states of different phases , creating a deviation from the classical phase .",
    "it is well known that the squeezed states is a general class of the minimum - uncertainty states  @xcite .",
    "bearing in mind that the nonlinearity of the binomial state yields squeezing of the quantum field and , as a result , entanglement between the two sub - systems is also produced  @xcite .",

    "this behavior of the quantum field distribution is similar to that of the thermal state  @xcite which means that once the kerr medium is added , makes it clear that rethermalization of the binomial field is indeed taking place .",
    "now , it is perfectly sensible to ask , what is the situation if the kerr medium parameter is increased by an integer value ? in this case , when the state evolves further , a multi - component structure develops as shown in figs 8c , e and 8 g , respectively . in these figures",
