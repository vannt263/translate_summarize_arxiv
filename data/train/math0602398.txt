    "designing efficient algorithms for computing the betti numbers of semi - algebraic sets is one of the outstanding open problems in algorithmic semi - algebraic geometry .",
    "there has been some recent progress in this area .",
    "it has been known for a while that the zero - th betti number ( which is also the number of connected components ) of semi - algebraic sets can be computed in single exponential time .",
    "very recently , it has been shown that even the first betti number , and more generally the first @xmath8 betti numbers for any fixed constant @xmath8 , can be computed in single exponential time  @xcite . since the problem of deciding whether a given semi - algebraic set in @xmath14 is empty or not is np - hard , and that of computing its zero - th betti number is # p - hard , the existence of polynomial time algorithms for computing the betti numbers is considered unlikely .",
    "one particularly interesting case is that of semi - algebraic sets defined by quadratic inequalities .",
    "the class of semi - algebraic sets defined by quadratic inequalities is the first interesting class of semi - algebraic sets after sets defined by linear inequalities , in which case the problem of computing topological information reduces to linear programming for which ( weakly ) polynomial time algorithms are known . from the point of view of computational complexity , it is easy to see that the boolean satisfiability problem can be posed as the problem of deciding whether a certain semi - algebraic set defined by quadratic inequalities is empty or not .",
    "thus , deciding whether such a set is empty is clearly np - hard and counting its number of connected components is @xmath15p - hard .",
    "however , semi - algebraic sets defined by quadratic inequalities are distinguished from arbitrary semi - algebraic sets in the sense that , _ if the number of inequalities is fixed _ , then the sum of their betti numbers is bounded polynomially in the dimension .",
    "the following bound was proved by barvinok  @xcite .",
    "[ the : barvinok ] let @xmath16 be a semi - algebraic set defined by the inequalities , @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "then , @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the @xmath21-th betti number , which is the dimension of the @xmath21-th singular cohomology group of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , with coefficients in @xmath24 .    in view of theorem  [ the : barvinok ] ,",
    "it is natural to consider the _ class of semi - algebraic sets defined by a fixed number of quadratic inequalities _ from a computational point of view .",
    "algorithms for computing various topological properties of this class of semi - algebraic sets have been developed , starting from the work of barvinok  @xcite , who described a polynomial time algorithm for testing emptiness of a set defined by a constant number of quadratic inequalities .",
    "this was later generalized and made constructive by grigoriev and pasechnik in  @xcite , where an algorithm is described for computing sample points in every connected component of a semi - algebraic set defined over a quadratic map .",
    "more recently , polynomial time algorithms have been designed for computing the euler - poincar characteristic  @xcite as well as all the betti numbers  @xcite of sets defined by a fixed number of quadratic inequalities ( with different dependence on the number of inequalities in the complexity bound ) .",
    "note also that the problem of deciding the emptiness of a set defined by a _",
    "single quartic equation _ is already np - hard and hence it is unlikely that there exists polynomial time algorithms for any of the above problems if the degree is allowed to be greater than two .    a case of intermediate complexity between semi - algebraic sets defined by polynomials of higher degree and sets defined by a fixed number of quadratic sign conditions is obtained by considering projections of such sets .",
    "the operation of linear projection of semi - algebraic sets plays a very significant role in algorithmic semi - algebraic geometry .",
    "it is a consequence of the tarski - seidenberg principle ( see for example @xcite , page 61 ) that the image of a semi - algebraic set under a linear projection is semi - algebraic , and designing efficient algorithms for computing properties of projections of semi - algebraic sets ( such as its description by a quantifier - free formula ) is a central problem of the area and is a very well - studied topic ( see for example  @xcite or  @xcite , chapter 14 ) .",
    "however , the complexities of the best algorithms for computing descriptions of projections of general semi - algebraic sets is singly exponential in the dimension and do not significantly improve when restricted to the class of semi - algebraic sets defined by a constant number of quadratic inequalities .",
    "indeed , any semi - algebraic set can be realized as the projection of a set defined by quadratic inequalities , and it is not known whether quantifier elimination can be performed efficiently when the number of quadratic inequalities is kept constant .",
    "however , we show in this paper that , with a fixed number of inequalities , the projections of such sets are topologically simpler than projections of general semi - algebraic sets .",
    "this suggests , from the point of view of designing efficient ( polynomial time ) algorithms in semi - algebraic geometry , that projections of semi - algebraic sets defined by a constant number of quadratic inequalities is the next natural class of sets to consider , after sets defined by linear and ( constant number of ) quadratic inequalities , and this is what we proceed to do in this paper .    in this paper",
    ", we describe a polynomial time algorithm ( algorithm  [ alg : main ] ) for computing certain betti numbers ( including the zero - th betti number which is the number of connected components ) of projections of sets defined by a constant number of quadratic inequalities , without having to compute a semi - algebraic description of the projection .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath25 be a compact semi - algebraic set defined by @xmath26 with @xmath27 , \\deg(p_i ) \\leq 2 , \\ ; 1 \\leq i \\leq \\ell$ ] .",
    "let @xmath28 be the projection onto the last @xmath29 coordinates . in what follows , the number of inequalities , @xmath12 , used in the definition of @xmath22 will be considered as some fixed constant . since",
    ", @xmath9 is not necessarily describable using only quadratic inequalities , the bound in theorem  [ the : barvinok ] does not hold for @xmath9 and @xmath9 can in principle be quite complicated . using the best known complexity estimates for quantifier elimination algorithms over the reals ( see  @xcite ) , we get single exponential ( in @xmath30 and @xmath29 ) bounds on the degrees and the number of polynomials necessary to obtain a semi - algebraic description of @xmath9 .",
    "in fact , there is no known algorithm for computing a semi - algebraic description of @xmath9 in time polynomial in @xmath30 and @xmath29 .",
    "nevertheless , we are able to prove that for any fixed constant @xmath31 , the sum of the first @xmath8 betti numbers of @xmath9 are bounded by a polynomial in @xmath30 and @xmath29 .",
    "more precisely , we obtain the following complexity bound ( see section  [ sec : proof ] ) .    [",
    "the : main1 ] let @xmath32 be a compact semi - algebraic set defined by @xmath33 ,   \\deg(p_i ) \\leq 2 , \\ ; 1 \\leq",
    "i \\leq \\ell.\\ ] ] let @xmath28 be the projection onto the last @xmath29 coordinates . for any @xmath34 , @xmath35    we also consider the problem of computing the betti numbers of @xmath9 .",
    "previously , there was no polynomial time algorithm for computing any non - trivial topological property of projections of sets defined by few quadratic inequalities .",
    "we describe a polynomial time algorithm for computing the first few betti numbers of @xmath9 .",
    "the algorithm ( algorithm  [ alg : main ] in section  [ sec : main ] ) computes @xmath36 the complexity of the algorithm is @xmath37 if the coefficients of the input polynomials are integers of bit - size bounded by @xmath38 , then the bit - size of the integers appearing in the intermediate computations and the output are bounded by @xmath39 note that the output of the algorithm includes @xmath40 which is the number of connected components of @xmath9 .",
    "alternatively , one could obtain @xmath41 by computing a semi - algebraic description of @xmath9 using an efficient quantifier elimination algorithm ( such as the one described in  @xcite ) and then using the algorithm described in  @xcite to compute the first few betti numbers .",
    "however , the complexity of this method would be worse : single exponential in @xmath30 and @xmath29 .",
    "thus , our algorithm is able to compute efficiently non - trivial topological information about the projection , even though it does not compute a semi - algebraic description of that projection ( it is not even known whether such a description could be computed in polynomial time ) .    in order to obtain algorithm  [ alg : main ] , we give a new construction of a certain spectral sequence , namely the _",
    "cohomological descent spectral sequence _ , which plays a crucial role in the design of the algorithm .",
    "even though variants of this spectral sequence have been known for some time @xcite , to our knowledge this is the first time it has been used in designing efficient algorithms .",
    "the new construction that makes this possible is formally analogous to that of the mayer - vietoris spectral sequence , which has been used several times recently in designing algorithms for computing betti numbers of semi - algebraic sets ( see @xcite ) , and thus this new construction ( see proposition  [ prop : mv ] below ) might be of independent interest .",
    "there are two main ingredients behind the results in this paper .",
    "the first is the use of cohomological descent , a spectral sequence first introduced by deligne  @xcite in the context of sheaf cohomology .",
    "this descent spectral sequence is used to compute the cohomology of the target of a continuous surjection ( under certain hypotheses only , the limit of this spectral sequence is not , in general , the homology of the target ) .",
    "the first terms of the sequence are cohomology groups of certain fibered products over the surjection , and this allows to bound the betti numbers of the target space in terms of the betti numbers of those fibered products .",
    "this estimate was first used by gabrielov , vorobjov and zell in  @xcite to give estimates on the betti numbers of projections of semi - algebraic sets ( and more generally , of semi - algebraic sets defined by arbitrary quantified formulas ) without resorting to quantifier elimination .",
    "another use of this sequence to establish upper - bounds can be found in  @xcite which contains effective estimates for the betti numbers of semi - algebraic hausdorff limits .",
    "the most striking feature of this spectral sequence argument is that it enables one to deduce properties ( for instance , bounds on the betti numbers ) of the projection of a set without having to explicitly describe the projection .",
    "for instance , consider a semi - algebraic subset of @xmath42 defined by a polynomial having a constant number ( say @xmath29 ) of monomials ( often referred to as a fewnomial ) .",
    "it is known due to classical results of khovansky  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that the betti numbers of such sets can be bounded in terms of @xmath29 and @xmath30 independent of the degree of the polynomial . using the spectral sequence argument mentioned above , it was proved in @xcite that even the betti numbers of the projection of such a set can be bounded in terms of the number of monomials , even though it is known ( see  @xcite ) that the projection itself might not admit a description in terms of fewnomials .",
    "the construction of the descent spectral sequence given in  @xcite involves consideration of join spaces and their filtrations and is not directly amenable for algorithmic applications . in section  [ sec : sequence ]",
    ", we give an alternate construction of a descent spectral sequence .",
    "when applied to surjections between open sets this spectral sequence converges to the cohomology of the image .",
    "the proof of this fact is formally analogous to the proof of convergence of the spectral sequence arising from the generalized mayer - vietoris sequence .",
    "this new proof allows us to identify a certain double complex , whose individual terms corresponds to the chain groups of the fibered products of the original set .",
    "the fibered product ( taken a constant number of times ) of a set defined by few quadratic inequalities is again a set of the same type .",
    "however , since there is no known algorithm for efficiently triangulating semi - algebraic sets ( even those defined by few quadratic inequalities ) we can not directly use the spectral sequence to actually compute the betti numbers of the projections . in order to do that we need an additional ingredient . this second main ingredient is a polynomial time algorithm described in @xcite for computing a complex whose cohomology groups are isomorphic to those of a given semi - algebraic set defined by a constant number of quadratic inequalities . using this algorithm we are able to construct a certain double complex ,",
    "whose associated total complex is quasi - isomorphic to ( implying having isomorphic homology groups ) a suitable truncation of the one obtained from the cohomological descent spectral sequence mentioned above .",
    "this complex is of much smaller size and can be computed in polynomial time and is enough for computing the first @xmath8 betti numbers of the projection in polynomial time for any fixed constant @xmath8 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : top_prelim ] we recall certain basic facts from algebraic topology including the notions of complexes , and double complexes of vector spaces and spectral sequences .",
    "we do not prove any results since all of them are quite classical and we refer the reader to appropriate references @xcite for the proofs . in section  [ sec : proof ]",
    "we prove the estimate on the sum of betti numbers ( theorem  [ the : main1 ] ) of projections of semi - algebraic sets defined by quadratic inequalities . in section  [ sec : sequence ] , we give our new construction of the cohomological descent spectral sequence in section  [ sec : algo ] , we briefly describe algorithm  [ alg : complex ] which is used to compute cohomology groups of semi - algebraic sets given by quadratic inequalities .",
    "this algorithm runs in polynomial time when the number of inequalities is constant .",
    "we only describe the inputs , outputs and the complexity estimates of the algorithms , referring the reader to  @xcite for more details .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : main ] we describe our algorithm ( algorithm  [ alg : main ] ) for computing the first few betti numbers of projections of semi - algebraic sets defined by quadratic inequalities .",
    "we first recall some basic facts from algebraic topology , related to double complexes , and spectral sequences associated to double complexes as well as to continuous maps between semi - algebraic sets .",
