    "it is evident that other kind of the nonclassical quantum correlation rather entanglement dominates the computational implementation of dqc@xmath0  @xcite .",

    "only when the qd disappears , the information can be safely obtained by locally measuring the distantly separate subsystem without disturbing the bipartite quantum system , where the corresponding state is fully classical .",
    "recently , the qd has successfully been used to study the quantum phase transition of the critical systems  @xcite , operational meanings for quantum processors  @xcite , and state preparation  @xcite .",
    "it is known that the realistic system inevitably interacts with the environment , resulting in the decoherence , which is of fundamental importance in the quantum information processing and measurement  @xcite . specially , yu and eberly  @xcite found that the dynamical behavior of the entanglement is significantly different from the single qubit in a pair of qubits separately coupling with markovian baths , which can be modeled from the well - known spin boson models  @xcite .",
    "it shows finite time disentanglement called as entanglement sudden death ( esd )  @xcite .",
    "however , this was investigated under quantum master equation with the born and markov approximation , which assumes that system - bath interaction is weak and the relaxation of the bath is much faster than that of the system .",
    "then further works have been done in the non - markovian regime in the framework of the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) to reveal novel characters of the quantum correlations compared to the markovian effect  @xcite , which is only valid under the condition of weak system - bath interaction . besides , entanglement dynamics beyond the weak coupling spin boson models",

    "it is pointed out that the corresponding accuracy in the wide parameter zone should be carefully analyzed  @xcite .",

    "this case is designed for two remote qubits each interacting locally with its own environment .",
    "such a physical condition is also relevant to the quantum information science and quantum computation .    in the present paper , to give a comprehensive picture of the two qubits coupled to their own bath and common bath , we will extend the hierarchy equation to these two kinds of baths to study the dynamics of the pairwise entanglement and the qd in both markovian and non - markovian regimes .",
