    "it is well known that all known types of matter with positive pressure generate attractive forces and decelerate the expansion of the universe .",
    "given this , a dark energy component with negative pressure was generally suggested to be the invisible fuel that drives the current acceleration of the universe .",

    "however , the dark energy has so far no convincing direct laboratory evidence for its existence , so it is desirable to explore alternative possibilities motivated by particle physics before adopting such a component . in this respect the models that make use of the very ideas of branes and extra dimensions",
    "to obtain an accelerating universe are particularly interesting ( randall and sundrum 1999a , b ) . within the framework of these braneworld cosmologies ,",
    "our observable universe is assumed to be a surface or a brane embedded in a higher dimensional bulk spacetime in which gravity could spread , and the bulk gravity sees its own curvature term on the brane which accelerates the universe without dark energy ( randall 2002 ) .",
    "recently , based on the model of dvali et al .",
    "( 2000 ) of brane - induced gravity , deffayet and coworkers ( deffayet 2001 , deffayet , dvali and gabadadze 2002 ) proposed a scenario in which the observed late time acceleration of the expansion of the universe is caused by gravitational leakage into an extra dimension and the friedmann equation is modified as follows @xmath8\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the hubble parameter as a function of redshift @xmath0 ( @xmath10 is its value at the present ) , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 represent the fractional contribution of curvature , the bulk - induced term and the matter ( both baryonic and nonbaryonic ) , respectively .",
    "@xmath12 is defined as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the crossover scale beyond which the gravitational force follows the 5-dimensional @xmath16 behavior . from a phenomenological standpoint , it is a testable scenario with the same number of parameters as a cosmological constant model , contrasting with models of quintessence that have an additional free function , the equation of state , to be determined ( deffayet et al .",
    "such a possible mechanism for cosmic acceleration has triggered investigations aiming to constrain this scenario using various cosmological observations , such as sneia ( avelino and martins 2002 ; deffayet , dvali and gabadadze 2002 ; deffayet et al . 2002",
    "; dabrowski et al .",

    "2002 ) and the large scale structures ( multamki et al . 2003 ) .",
    "but the results are disperse and somewhat controversial , with most of them claiming good agreement between data and the model while some of them ruling out gravitational leakage into an extra dimension as a feasible mechanism for cosmic acceleration .",
    "the purpose of this work is to quantitatively confront the scenario with the updated sneia sample compiled by tonry et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and to try to constrain the model parameters more accurately .",
    "it is shown that , although the two parameters , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , are degenerate and there is a range on the parameter plane to be consistent with the sneia data , a closed universe is prefered by this scenario .",
    "as is well known , the measurement of the x - ray gas mass fraction in galaxy clusters is an efficient way to determine the matter density , @xmath13 , and hence can be used for breaking the degeneracy between @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "when we combine the x - ray database published by allen et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2003 ) for analyzing , we obtained a closed universe at a 99% confidence level , i.e. , for the scenario of gravitational leakage into an extra dimension , a universe with curvature is favored by the combination of the two databases .",
    "we also analyze the turnaround redshift , @xmath4 , at which the universe switches from deceleration to acceleration within the framework of the scenario .",
    "it is shown that , if the turnaround redshift happened earlier than @xmath5 , only a low matter density , @xmath6 , or a closed universe can explain this transition epoch . if , however , we consider the recent estimate by riess et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , i.e. , @xmath17 , then a spatially flat scenario with @xmath18 ( as suggested by clustering estimates ) predicts @xmath19 , which is surprisingly close to the central value given by riess et al .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we consider the observational constraints on the parameter space of the scenario arising from the updated sneia sample compiled by tonry et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , as well as the combination with the x - ray gas mass fractions in galaxy clusters published by allen et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2003 ) . in section  3",
    "we discuss the bounds on the model from the turnaround redshift , @xmath4",
    ". finally , we present our conclusion and discussion in section  4 .",
    "recently , tonry et al . ( 2003 ) compiled a large database of sneia from the literature and eight new sneia from the high-@xmath0 supernova search team .",
    "since the techniques for data analysis vary between individual sneia samples , the authors have attempted to recompute the extinction estimates and the distance determination through the mlcs fitting ( riess et al .",
    "1998 ) , the @xmath20 method of phillips et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , the modified dm15 fitting ( germany 2001 ) and the batm method ( tonry 2003 ) .",
    "zero - point differences between each method were computed by comparing common sn measurements , and distances were placed on a hubble flow zeropoint ( @xmath21 ) , and the median selected as the best distance estimate ( for more details of this procedure , see tonry et al .",
    "2003 ; barris et al .",
    "tonry et al .",
    "( 2003 ) present redshift and distance for 230 sneia , which includes many objects unsuitable for cosmological analysis , such as the sneia being heavily extinguished or nearby enough for velocity uncertainties to be a major problem . to determine cosmological parameters , the authors used a redshift cut of @xmath22 and an extinction cut of @xmath23 mag .",
    "the resulting sample of 172 sneia is illustrated on a residual hubble diagram with respect to an empty universe ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) in figure  1 .",
    "we will use this sample to give an observational constraint on the model parameters , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .    for the ansatz ( 1 ) , we are required to calculate @xmath26 as a function of the model parameters ( @xmath13 , @xmath12 ) and the hubble constant @xmath10 .",
    "following tonry et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , we added 500 km s@xmath27 divided by the redshift in quadrature to the distance error given in their table  15 for calculating @xmath26 . in order to concentrate solely on the density parameters , we need to marginalize over the hubble constant @xmath10 .",
    "since @xmath10 appears as a quadratic term in @xmath26 , it appears as a separable gaussian factor in the probability to be marginalized over .",
    "thus marginalizing over @xmath10 is equivalent to evaluating @xmath26 at its minimum with respect to @xmath10 ( barris et al .",
    "this procedure allows us to determine contours of constant probability density for the model parameters ( @xmath13 , @xmath12 ) corresponding to 68% , 95% , and 99% confidence levels , which is shown in figure  2 .",
    "the best fit happens at @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "as is shown in figure  2 , although there is a range on the parameter plane to be consistent with the sneia data , a closed universe is favored .",
    "furthmore , the two density parameters , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , are highly degenerate , which is very similar to the degeneracy between @xmath30 and @xmath13 found by tonry et al . ( 2003 ) . in order to determine @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively",
    ", an independent measurement of @xmath12 or @xmath13 is needed .",
    "as shown below , the x - ray gas mass fraction data of galaxy clusters are appropriate for this purpose , because the data are only sensitive to @xmath13 ( allen et al . 2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "since clusters of galaxies are the largest virialized systems in the universe , their matter content should provide a fair sample of the matter content of the universe as a whole , and a comparison of their gas mass fractions , @xmath31 , as inferred from x - ray observations , with the cosmic baryon fraction can provide a direct constraint on the density parameter of the universe @xmath13 ( white et .",
    "al . 1993 ) .",
    "moreover , assuming the gas mass fraction is constant in cosmic time , sasaki ( 1996 ) shows that the @xmath32 measurements of clusters of galaxies at different redshifts also provide a way to constrain other cosmological parameters describing the geometry of the universe .",
    "recently , allen et al . ( 2002 ; 2003 ) published the @xmath32 profiles for the 10 relaxed clusters observed by the _",
    "chandra _ satellite . except for abell 963 ,",
    "the @xmath32 profiles of the other 9 clusters appear to have converged or be close to converging with @xmath33 , the radius within which the mean mass density is 2500 times the critical density of the universe at the redshift of the cluster .",
    "the gas mass fraction values of these 9 clusters were shown in figure  5 of allen et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . this database can be used to break the degeneracy between @xmath12 and @xmath13 mentioned above , since it has been shown that the x - ray gas mass fraction is mostly sensitive to @xmath13 no matter what the cosmological model is ( allen et al .",
    "2002 ; lima et al .",
    "the probability density over the model parameters , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , for the 9 galaxy clusters is calculated using the method described in allen et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . following allen et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , we include gaussian priors on the bias factor , @xmath34 , a value appropriate for hot ( @xmath35 kev ) clusters from the simulations of bialek et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , on the hubble constant , @xmath36 , the final result from the hubble key project by freedman et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and on @xmath37 ( omeara et al .",
    "2001 ) , from cosmic nucleosynthesis calculations constrained by the observed abundances of light elements at high redshifts .",
    "we then multiply the probability densities from the 172 sneia and the 9 galaxy clusters , and obtain our final results on @xmath12 and @xmath13 , which are shown in figure  3 .",
    "figure  3 illustrates the 68% , 95% and 99% confidence levels in the ( @xmath13,@xmath12 ) plane using the red , green and yellow shaded areas , respectively .",
    "our fits give at a 99% confidence level that @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "although there is a range on the parameter plane being consistent with both the sneia and galaxy clusters data , and the resulting matter density @xmath13 is reasonable , a closed universe is obtained at a 99% confidence level , which is inconsistent with the result , @xmath38 , found by the wmap ( bennett et al .",
    "avelino and martins ( 2002 ) analyzed the same model with the 92 sneia from riess et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and perlmutter et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . assuming a flat universe , the authors obtained a very low matter density and claimed the model was disfavorable . in additional to",
    "including new sneia data from tonry et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , and combining the x - ray data of 9 galaxy clusters , we relax the flat universe constraint in their analysis .",
    "we obtained a reasonable matter density , but a closed universe . in some sense ,",
    "i.e. , if we assume that our universe is spatially flat , as indicated by wmap results , the accelerating scenario from gravitational leakage into extra dimension does not seem to be favored by observational data .",
    "however , two points should be emphasized here .",
    "first , that the same conclusion happens by performing a similar analysis with our current standard model , i.e. , a @xmath7cdm universe .",
    "second , that we have made heavy use of the x - ray gas mass fraction in clusters to determine the matter density .",
    "this kind of analysis depends on the assumption that @xmath32 values should be invariant with redshift , which has been criticised by a minority of works in the field .",
    "for example , a recent comparison of distant clusters observed by xmm - newton and chandra satellites with available local cluster samples indicate a possible evolution of the @xmath39@xmath40 relation with redshift , i.e. , the standard paradigm on cluster gas physics need to be revised ( vauclair et al .",
    "we should keep this point in mind when we make the conclusion that the gravitational leakage scenario is disfavored by the databases .",
    "since the scenario of gravitational leakage into extra dimensions is proposed as a possible mechanism for the cosmic acceleration , the turnaround redshift from deceleration to acceleration is expected to provide an efficient way for verifying the model .",
    "it can be shown that the deceleration parameter as a function of redshift as well as the model parameters takes the form ( zhu and fujimoto 2004 ) @xmath41 where @xmath42 . from eq.(1 ) , we could derive the turnaround redshift at which the universe switches from deceleration to acceleration , or in other words the redshift at which the deceleration parameter vanishes , which is as follows @xmath43 we have shown that eq .",
    "( 3 ) is generally valid no matter what the curvature of the universe is , though it was first obtained by avelino and martins ( 2002 ) for a flat universe . according to turner and riess ( 2002 ) ,",
    "the value for the turnaround redshift lies in the @xmath44 interval @xmath45 . in fig.4 ,",
    "the two dashed lines represent @xmath5 and @xmath46 , respectively , while the hatched region at lower right corresponds to @xmath47 , which means a decelerating universe .",
    "the thick solid line is the flat universe .",
    "the vertical strip with cross - hatching is the matter density @xmath48 found by turner ( 2002 ) , and the vertical dot - dashed lines are @xmath49 , a wider range . as is shown , in order to explain that cosmic acceleration started earlier than @xmath5 , either a low matter density , @xmath6 , is needed on the assumption of a flat universe , or a closed universe is necessary for a higher matter density . if , however , we consider the recent estimate by riess et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , i.e. , @xmath17 , then a spatially flat scenario with @xmath50 ( as suggested by clustering estimates ) predicts @xmath19 , which is surprisingly close to the central value given by riess et al .",
    "the mounting observational evidences for an accelerating universe have stimulated renewed interest for alternative cosmologies . generally , a dark energy component with negative pressure is invoked to explain the sneia results and to reconcile the inflationary flatness prediction ( @xmath51 ) with the dynamical estimates of the quantity of matter in the universe ( @xmath52 ) . in this paper",
    "we have focused our attention on another possible acceleration mechanism , one arising from gravitational leakage into extra dimensions . in order to be consistent with the current sneia and the x - ray clusters data",
    ", one would need a closed universe .",
    "recently lue et al .",
    "( 2004 ) derived dynamical equations for spherical perturbations at subhorizon scales and computed the growth of large - scale structure in the framework of this scenario .",
    "a suppression of the growth of density and velocity perturbations was found , e.g. , for @xmath50 , a perturbation of @xmath53 at @xmath54 collapse in the @xmath7cdm case at @xmath55 when its linearly extrapolated density contrast is @xmath56 , while for the model being considered the collapse happens much later at @xmath57 when its @xmath58 .",
    "furthermore , the authors showed that this scenario for cosmic acceleration gave rise to a present day fluctuation power spectrum normalization @xmath59 at a 2@xmath60 level , lower than observed value ( lue et al .",
    "2004 ) .    as is shown in figure  2 of deffayet , dvali and gabadadze ( 2002 ) , on the assumption of a flat universe , luminosity distance for @xmath7cdm increases with redshift faster than that for the model being considered does ( for the same @xmath13 ) .",
    "therefore it is natural that , if the @xmath7cdm model with ( @xmath50 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) is consistent with the sneia data , the gravitational leakage model with ( @xmath50 , @xmath63 , @xmath62 ) will not be as the data are becoming enough to determine the cosmological parameters more precisely . while deffayet et al .",
    "( 2002 ) showed that the gravitational leakage scenario was consistent with the 54 sneia of the sample c from perlmutter et al .",
    "( 1999 )  see also alcaniz & pires ( 2004 )  avelino and martins ( 2002 ) claimed that this proposal was disfavored by the dataset of 92 sneia from riess et al ( 1998 ) and perlmutter et al .",
    "( 1999 ) [ combining them via the procedure described in wang ( 2000 ) and wang & garnavich ( 2001 ) ] . we , however , think that only with a more general analysis , a joint investigation involving different classes of cosmological tests , it will be possible to delimit the @xmath64 plane more precisely , as well as to test more properly the consistency of these senarios",
