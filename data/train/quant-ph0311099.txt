    "the advent of photon - based quantum cryptography , communication , and computation schemes@xcite has increased the need for light sources that produce individual photons@xcite .",
    "an ideal single - photon source would produce completely characterized single photons on demand . since all of the currently available sources fall far short of this ideal , many new schemes have been proposed for creating single photon on demand sources ( spod ) . many of these schemes@xcite rely on optical parametric downconversion ( pdc ) , because it produces photons two at a time , allowing one photon to herald the existence of the other . in a previous work we proposed one such scheme for a multiplexed single photon on - demand source that increases the probability of single photon emission while suppressing the probability of multi - photon generation@xcite .",
    "most pdc based schemes ( including ours ) require that the pdc output be collected into a single spatial mode defined by an optical fiber . in order for these pdc schemes to produce a reliable spod source ,",
    "it is essential that the optical collection system efficiently gathers and detects the herald photon and sends its twin to the output path of the system .",
    "various theoretical models have been developed to predict how the collection efficiency of pdc light in a `` two - photon single mode '' can be improved @xcite , and in many cases these models have been experimentally proven to give a better coupling efficiency . in particular , it has been shown that the position and size of the pump beam focus affect the shape of the pdc output@xcite and hence the coupling efficiency of the pdc into a given spatial mode .",
    "in addition , a more detailed work@xcite recently showed how crystal length and walk - off also affect the coupling efficiency for a pulsed broadband pump .",
    "( however , in that recent work the attempts to increase the single mode fiber coupling efficiency were centered on having a thin crystal and a tightly focused pump beam , which is achieved at a cost of overall source brightness . )",
    "the work done to date on coupling efficiency gives some guidance for increasing coupling efficiency . however , there is still not a practical `` recipe '' to quantify and maximize the coupling of pdc light into single mode fibers .    in this paper",
    "we present a method for analytically calculating the coupling efficiency of pdc light into single mode fiber .",
    "specifically , we calculate the spatial and angular overlap between type  i pdc output and the two single modes defined by optical fibers .",
    "the collection efficiency is evaluated in terms of pump waist , collecting mode , crystal length , and the imaging conditions of the optical collection system . to ease the computational difficulties associated with this problem",
    ", we make the approximation of near - perfect phase matching .",
    "we quantify the limitations introduced by this approximation and then show by example how we can obtain better coupling efficiency by properly shaping the pump beam and collection modes for a given crystal length .",
    "although our approximations limit the length of crystals that can be analyzed using this method , this formalism does allow us to study crystals with lengths beyond what is considered the thin crystal limit . as a next step in this research",
    "we plan to use a more exact model with a numerical evaluation that allows us to model the efficiency over a wider range of parameter values ( expecially longer crystal cases ) .",
    "to determine the coupling efficiency between the parametric downconversion output and two single collection modes ( defined in our setup by single - mode optical fibers ) we must calculate the spatial overlap of the two - photon field of the pdc source with the modes selected by the fibers .",
    "the first step in this procedure is to calculate the two - photon field @xcite given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the vacuum state and @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the positive - frequency portions of the electric field evaluated at positions @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the two - photon state at the output surface of a pdc crystal oriented with its face perpendicular to the @xmath6-axis is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the cross sectional area of the crystal illuminated by the pump , @xmath9 is the transverse distance from the @xmath6-axis , and @xmath10 is the length of the crystal .",
    "we designate the component of a wavevector that is parallel to the crystal face by @xmath11 , so that @xmath12 .",
    "the subscripts @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 indicate the signal , idler , and pump .",
    "the quantities @xmath16 and @xmath17 are referred to as the longitudinal and transverse wave - vector mismatch , respectively .",
    "the pump beam s angular spectrum defines its transverse distribution via the fourier transform @xmath18 this analysis assumes that the pump propagates with negligible diffraction effect inside the crystal , so that @xmath19 is independent of @xmath6 .    the electric fields in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : biphoton ] ) are evaluated outside the crystal , while the wavevectors in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) are evaluated inside the crystal . to evaluate eq .",
    "( [ eqn : biphoton ] ) it is convenient to write @xmath20 in terms of the angular frequency , @xmath21 , and the index of refraction , @xmath22 , since the @xmath6 components of the wavevectors are discontinuous at the crystal surface .",
    "thus , the @xmath6  component of a wavevector is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the speed of light .",
    "we assume that the pump beam has a narrow angular spectrum ( transverse wavevector distribution ) and that the signal and idler are observed only at points close to the @xmath6 axis .",
    "in addition , we assume that only a narrow range of frequencies are collected because narrow bandpass filters are placed the signal and idler optical paths .",
    "the central frequencies defined be these filters are specified by @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "( in our notation we denote central frequencies chosen as system parameters by capital @xmath27 and frequency variables by lower case @xmath21 . )",
    "we then expand @xmath20 around these central frequencies to obtain @xcite @xmath28 where we have @xmath29 in obtaining these expressions we have assumed type - i phasematching with perfect frequency matching , i.e. @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the pump angular frequency .",
    "the angle between the pump propagation direction and the crystal optic axis is specified by @xmath32 , and the pdc photons emission angles are given by @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "we have developed the angular frequency as @xmath35 and @xmath36 , with @xmath37 .",
    "note that in the degenerate case we have @xmath38 .",
    "we assume the pdc light is collected into two single - mode fibers using identical lenses ( with focal lengths @xmath39 ) both placed at a distances @xmath40 from the fiber tips and @xmath41 from the crystal face , where @xmath42 is the magnification .",
    "( we assume that the fibers define single gaussian modes .",

    ") in this situation we can write the biphoton field as @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the transfer functions of the lenses in the optical path of the idler and signal and @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the transverse coordinates measured from the @xmath48 and @xmath49 axes , respectively ( see fig .  1 ) , at the imaging plane of the lenses",
    ". the functions @xmath50 and @xmath51 define the spectral transmittances of interference filters placed in the two collection paths . to simplify the form of the transfer functions",
    ", we use the paraxial approximation and consider an ideal lens with infinite aperture . under these assumptions",
    "the transfer functions are given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 provides for non - perfect imaging caused by precision limits in the setting of the lens - fiber - crystal distances .",
    "the pump field transverse distribution is defined to be gaussian with a waist of @xmath54 , and we assume that the transverse crystal size is large relative to the pump beam , so we can take the cross section @xmath8 to be infinite .",
    "we also assume perfect transverse phase matching , i.e. @xmath55 .",
    "these assumptions allow the @xmath56 and @xmath9 integrals in eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) to be trivially performed @xmath57 we next assume that the longitudinal mismatch is small ( @xmath58 ) and that we have near - perfect imaging ( @xmath59 ) . in this case , we can expand the exponentials in the eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) and use the result in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : pumpint ] ) to obtain @xmath60 the spectral filters defined by @xmath61 and @xmath62 are centered around the wavelengths @xmath25 and @xmath26 are both assumed to have a rectangular bandwidth @xmath63 .",

    "( [ 11 ] ) in hand we are prepared to calculate the coupling of the biphoton field into the single mode fibers in our setup . to accomplish this we write @xmath67 as a coherent superposition of guided modes in the fiber as suggested in ref .",
    "@xmath68 the collection efficiency can then be calculated by @xmath69 where @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 measure the square of the overlap between the biphoton field and the collection modes , and can be used to calculate singles and coincidence counting rates @xmath73 we assume the guided mode is a gaussian defined by @xmath74\\ ] ] where @xmath75 is the width of the collection fiber .",
    "the waist of the collected mode imaged back to the crystal is given by @xmath76 , where @xmath77 .",
    "the collection efficiency is then obtained by using eq.([11 ] ) and ( [ 12 ] ) @xmath78 where the collection efficiency at the zero order of the perturbation theory ( very thin crystals ) is @xmath79 and the corrections are @xmath80 we can perform these integrals using the expressions developed above to obtain @xmath81",
    "to illustrate the use of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : efficiency ] ) we consider a lithium iodate crystal with @xmath82 .",
    "the crystal is pumped with 458  nm light with @xmath83 and the collection modes are arranged to collect degenerate pdc emission at @xmath84 with a bandwidth of @xmath85 ( about 10 nm ) .",
    "the magnification is fixed at @xmath86 and we assume that the collection mode waist occurs at the crystal with perfect imaging ( @xmath87 ) . figure  2a plots the collection efficiency versus the pump waist for different collection mode waists .",

    "note that for the case of @xmath93 ( which satisfies the thin crystal approximation ) the optimum collection efficiency can be obtained for all the collection modes by picking a sufficiently large pump waist .",
    "however for the longer crystals this is not the case .",

    "figure 4b is the same as fig .",
    "4a but in the non - perfect imaging condition @xmath104 , which reduces the collection efficiency .",
    "notice that as the crystal gets longer larger collection modes give a better coupling efficiency .",
    "even though a longer crystal length reduces the collection efficiency obtainable for a given pump size , these longer crystals may still be desirable since they produce more overall signal .",

    "in the interest of optimizing the brightness of two - photon sources for use in emerging applications of quantum information , we have presented an analytical calculation of the collection efficiency of pdc light into single mode fibers .",
    "our calculation was performed for the case of long pump pulse and type i pdc .",
    "these experimental conditions are similar to those used in many spod sources .",
    "we demonstrated that for crystals that are longer than those required by the thin crystal approximation ( but still within the approximation made in the model ) the maximum collection efficiency can be obtained at larger pump waists .",
    "however , as longer crystals are used the maximum achievable collection efficiency decreases .",
    "the approximations made in obtaining the expression for coupling efficiency limit the range of parameters that can be studied using this method .",
    "it is particularly important to pay close attention to the validity range of the approximations to assure meaningful results , as this has not been emphasized in some other works .",
