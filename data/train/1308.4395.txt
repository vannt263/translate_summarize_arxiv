    "the study of spin systems is a widespread subject ranging from the theory of magnetism , quantum spin hall effect , quantum computation , spintronics , superconductivity , to nuclear physics . in the last few decades",
    ", several methods have been developed to tackle the problem of spin systems .",
    "these methods include mapping to bosonic operators @xcite ( e.g schwinger bosons , holstein primakoff transformation etc ) , semiclassical methods @xcite ( e.g spin coherent state path integral ) and effective potential method @xcite .    in the last decade ,",
    "there have been considerable interest in single ferromagnetic spin systems due to the fact that they exhibit first- or second - order phase transition between quantum and classical regimes for the escape rate @xcite .",
    "the transition occurs in the presence of a potential barrier and it takes place in two categories : classical thermal activation over the barrier and quantum tunnelling through the barrier .",
    "the classical thermal activation occurs at high temperature , in this case the transition rate is governed by @xmath4 $ ] , where @xmath5 is the energy barrier . below a particular temperature @xmath6 , quantum tunnelling dominates thermal hopping and one should expect a temperature - independent rate of the form @xmath7 $ ] , where @xmath8 is the euclidean ( imaginary time @xmath9 ) action evaluated along the instanton path .",

    "the biaxial single ferromagnet spin has been studied by many authors @xcite , but not much is known about the behaviour of antiferomagnetic spin systems in this formalism . in this paper we consider a two - sublattice antiferromagnetic spins , denoted by @xmath15 and @xmath16 , in the presence of a single ( hard - axis ) and double ion anisotropies .",
    "such antiferromagnetic interactions arises in some compounds like csfe@xmath17 , which was recently studied using the inelastic neutron scattering @xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in section ii , we present the model hamiltonian of the two - sublattice antiferromagnetic large spins , and then map it to a reduced one - dimensional quantum - mechanical particle using the well studied method of effective potential mapping . the instanton trajectory and the ground state energy splitting",
