    "the recent advent of x - ray free - electron lasers ( xfel )  @xcite enables us to explore new frontiers of science  @xcite , for example , femtosecond x - ray imaging  @xcite and warm dense matter  @xcite .",
    "a series of experiments conducted at the linac coherent light source ( lcls )  @xcite have shown how ultraintense and ultrashort x rays interact with various systems : light atom ( ne )  @xcite , molecule ( n@xmath3 )  @xcite , heavy atom ( xe )  @xcite , and solid ( al )  @xcite .",
    "the ionizing xfel ",
    "matter interaction is one of the most fundamental processes that affects all xfel applications .",
    "as demonstrated theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite , the electronic response to an xfel pulse is characterized by a sequence of one - photon ionization and relaxation events . in the x - ray regime ,",
    "photoabsorption predominantly ionizes an inner - shell electron .",
    "the resulting inner - shell vacancy is filled via radiative ( fluorescence ) and/or non - radiative ( auger and coster  kronig ) transitions .",
    "then the extremely large number of x - ray photons within an ultrashort xfel pulse can keep ionizing after or even before these relaxation processes are over  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "atoms or molecules become highly ionized after absorbing several photons sequentially . to describe ionization dynamics",
    ", we employ a rate equation model , which demonstrates good agreement with experiments conducted at lcls  @xcite . tracking populations via rate equations",
    "is sufficient to describe the ionization dynamics during xfel pulses , mainly because the coherence time of current xfel sources is much shorter than the time scale of population changes .",
    "the ionization dynamics in an xfel pulse differ from those at a third - generation x - ray synchrotron radiation source , where one - photon absorption is dominant , and from multiphoton strong - field ionization , where many photons are simultaneously absorbed to ionize a single electron .",
    "understanding radiation damage mechanisms  @xcite including ionization dynamics is of central importance for single - shot imaging of individual molecules  @xcite .    to probe ionization dynamics induced by an xfel",
    ", one can collect all particles generated in the interaction between xfel and matter .",
    "photoionization and auger ( coster  kronig ) decay produce electrons , and fluorescence produces photons .",
    "also highly charged ions are generated via multiphoton multiple ionization .",
    "it is possible to simultaneously measure all those particles by means of the cfel ",
    "asg multi - purpose ( camp ) instrument  @xcite , which has been successfully applied to a study of the xfel  heavy atom interaction  @xcite and to single - shot imaging experiments  @xcite .",
    "ionization of heavy atoms irradiated by xfel pulses has attracted considerable attention , not only because the heavy atom has many electrons to be ionized but also because it has a rich manifold of ionization channels involving complex inner - shell decay cascades .",
    "a recent study proposes a resonance - enabled x - ray multiple ionization mechanism for heavy atoms to reach high charge states beyond those expected from the straightforward sequential ionization model  @xcite .",
    "also , ionization dynamics of heavy atoms embedded in macromolecules deliver a novel way to determine macromolecular structure from femtosecond nanocrystallography data using xfel  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical treatment of the xfel  heavy atom interaction is challenging because its dynamics involve a huge number of possible pathways .",
    "for example , the simple rate equation model for xe @xmath4-shell ionization requires more than one million coupled rate equations  @xcite .",
    "this number becomes even much larger when resonantly excited rydberg states are taken into account .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to develop a computational tool that can handle heavy atoms and provide full information on ions , electrons , and photons .    in the present work , we employ the monte carlo method to solve the large number of coupled rate equations .",
    "there have been extensive studies using the monte carlo procedure for decay pathways of an inner - shell vacancy produced by x - ray synchrotron or electron capture  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the inner - shell decay process for heavy atoms such as iodine and xenon  @xcite has brought much interest because of their relevance for medical applications  @xcite . in conventional implementations of the monte carlo method ,",
    "atomic data for multiple - hole ions are usually assumed to be the same as for the singly - ionized atom  @xcite or they are scaled from the singly - ionized atom according to the number of valence electrons  @xcite . to the best of our knowledge , no monte carlo calculation has been done using atomic data that are individually calculated for all possible multiple - hole configurations . in the current implementation",
    ", we perform electronic structure calculations individually for all possible configurations in order to obtain a whole set of atomic data .",
    "this is important for ionization dynamics in xfel radiation because of the production of a broad range of charge states .",
    "the higher the ionic charge , the greater are the deviations from the singly - ionized atom . as the charge state increases ,",
    "some auger transitions become energetically forbidden  @xcite .",
    "thus , the detailed electronic structure for each configuration matters to atomic data calculations and eventually to ionization dynamics simulations .",
    "another distinct aspect of the monte carlo implementation described in this paper is the availability of temporal information on electronic dynamics . in ordinary monte carlo simulations of electronic decay cascades ,",
    "the time variable has not been of main concern , and in many cases decay rates are simply given by relative rates . however , it is important to know details of ionization dynamics , especially when their time scale is comparable with the time scale of nuclear dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] , we describe the rate equation model for ionization dynamics and present a monte carlo implementation for solving a large set of coupled rate equations . in sec .",

    "we conclude with a summary and outlook in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "to simulate ionization dynamics in intense x - ray pulses , we employ a rate equation approach based on sequential one - photon ionization and relaxation steps .",
    "this rate equation model was introduced in connection with xfel  atom interactions by rohringer and santra  @xcite , extended to x - ray scattering dynamics  @xcite , generalized to arbitrary elements  @xcite , and has been successfully applied to explain recent lcls experiments  @xcite .",
    "a rate equation model for non - local thermal equilibrium plasma  @xcite has been applied to a warm dense matter study at lcls  @xcite .    here ,",
    "we summarize procedures underlying the rate equation model .",
    "for interested readers , theoretical background  @xcite and detailed descriptions  @xcite are available . for a given atom",
    ", we construct all possible electronic configurations @xmath5 that may be formed by removing zero , one , or more electrons , from the neutral ground configuration .",
    "the orbital structures are optimized with the hartree ",
    "fock  slater ( hfs ) method for each configuration .",
    "we include all possible one - photon ionization and relaxation processes for each configuration , i.e. , the subshell photoionization cross sections for a given photon energy , auger ( coster  kronig ) decay rates , and fluorescence rates are calculated for every single configuration .",
    "we calculate shake - off branching ratios , based on the sudden change approximation  @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "shake - off processes are included for all photo - induced processes of neutral xe .",
    "the calculated cross sections and rates serve as input parameters for a set of rate equations of the form , @xmath6,\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the population of the @xmath8th configuration , and @xmath9 is the rate for a transition from the configuration @xmath8 to the configuration @xmath10 .    for the heavy atom case ,",
    "the numbers of configurations and processes involved in ionization dynamics are very large .",
    "for example , an x - ray photon of 4500  ev can ionize the @xmath4- , @xmath11- , and @xmath12-shells of xe .",
    "the number of all possible electronic configurations constructed from these ionizations is 1,120,581 , which is equal to the number of coupled rate equations to be solved , and the number of all possible processes under consideration is 43,221,650 .",
    "therefore we need to propagate in time a matrix of approximately one million by one million with @xmath1340 million nonzero elements , in order to simulate , within the rate equation model , ionization dynamics of xe exposed to 4500-ev xfel pulses . to avoid a direct time - propagation solution of this huge matrix",
    ", we develop a monte carlo approach that efficiently solves the rate equations , as an extension of the xatom toolkit  @xcite .",
    "our monte carlo description of ionization dynamics may be summarized as follows . for one realization ( a monte carlo trajectory ) ,",
    "a given atom undergoes a sequence of photoionization and relaxation events during the time propagation and eventually ends up in a final charge state .",
    "there are many pathways to reach the same final charge state .",
    "each pathway consists of many steps of photoionization and relaxation , and those steps are stochastically determined .",
    "probabilities are calculated at a given time and the time increment is optimally determined during the time propagation . if it is no longer possible to proceed to a further process , the time propagation ends and this trajectory is complete .",
    "we repeat this procedure for many trajectories to form a sufficiently large statistical ensemble .    in the direct time - propagation solution ,",
    "configuration populations are given by a fractional number representing the probabilities for all individual configurations .",
    "on the other hand , for each realization of the monte carlo implementation , configuration populations are given by either zero or one , thus following a specific pathway of configuration changes induced by photoionization and relaxation events .",
    "after running many trajectories , we obtain ensemble - averaged configuration populations , which are ideally the same as the configuration populations obtained by the direct solution .",
    "here is a more detailed description of our monte carlo implementation .",

    "this is also used for the maximum value of @xmath14 .",
    "b.   set up an initial configuration @xmath8 , which is usually given by the ground configuration of a neutral atom .",

    "@xmath21 where @xmath22 is the photon flux of the x - ray pulse at a given time @xmath15 , @xmath23 is the photoionization cross section , @xmath24 is the auger ( coster  kronig ) rate , and @xmath25 is the fluorescence rate . d.   construct a table of processes , @xmath26 .",

    "if @xmath32 , then it proceeds to the @xmath18th process and the new configuration becomes @xmath10 .",
    "for auger ( coster  kronig ) decay and photoionization processes , the electron count corresponding to its kinetic energy bin is increased by one . for fluorescence , the photon count corresponding to its emitted photon energy bin",
    "is increased by one .",
    "f.   adjust @xmath14 according to the calculated @xmath29 .",
    "it must satisfy @xmath33 and must not be larger than the initial @xmath14 . then increase the time variable @xmath15 by @xmath14 .",
    "g.   repeat ( c)(f ) as long as @xmath34 .",
    "if @xmath35 , there will be no further process .",
    "this finishes one monte carlo trajectory of the time - propagation calculation .",
    "the final charge state count is increased by one .",
    "h.   run many trajectories until the results are converged .",
    "i.   the counts of charge state , electron energy , and photon energy are divided by the number of trajectories . these histograms correspond to the ion , electron , and photon spectra , respectively .",

    "these monte carlo results fully agree with the direct solution to within an accuracy of @xmath38 discrepancies .",
    "there is a tremendous reduction in the computational time .",
    "the direct solution takes about 1,760 minutes for a xe - atom ionization dynamics calculation with 16,000 time steps on the lab workstation , whereas the monte carlo implementation takes only 7 minutes with about 20,000 trajectories to get converged results .",

    "second , it is important to include bound - to - bound photoexcitation processes in the model , which may play a crucial role in ionization dynamics at certain conditions . because ionization thresholds have a broad range according to charge states and because xfel pulses typically have a broad bandwidth , resonance conditions may be easily satisfied .",
