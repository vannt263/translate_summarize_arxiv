    "among the proposed extensions of the standard model , supersymmetry is one of the most attractive from a theoretical point of view , in particular because it automatically solves the hierarchy problem .",
    "however , the lack of experimental evidence put strong constraints on supersymmetric models such as the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "the fact that no superpartner has been discovered so far implies a ( at least in part ) heavy supersymmetric spectrum , which exacerbates the `` little hierarchy '' problem associated with the lep bound on the higgs mass and increases the level of fine - tuning in the higgs potential .",
    "furthermore , the absence of any significant deviation from the standard model predictions in flavour physics places strong restrictions on the generational structure of squark and slepton masses . gauge mediation  @xcite offers a natural solution to this problem : supersymmetry breaking is communicated to the observable sector by gauge interactions , and is therefore automatically flavour blind . on the other hand ,",
    "gauge mediation suffers from the so - called @xmath1/@xmath8 problem  @xcite , i.e. the fact that the @xmath1 and @xmath2 parameters of the mssm are typically generated at the same loop order , leading to @xmath9 , which is inconsistent with natural electroweak symmetry breaking .    both problems",
    "  the little hierarchy problem and the @xmath1/@xmath2 problem of gauge mediation   may actually have a common solution in terms of pseudo - goldstone bosons . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a mechanism involving additional singlet superfields was proposed to generate the @xmath1 and @xmath2 parameters at the one- and two - loop levels , respectively , leading to the order - of - magnitude relation @xmath10 .",
    "it was pointed out that this relation has a pseudo - goldstone interpretation : in some limit where the higgs superpotential becomes invariant under a global @xmath0 symmetry , one combination of the two higgs doublets remains massless after spontaneous breaking of this symmetry due to the relation @xmath11 ( in which the soft higgs mass parameters have been omitted ) . regarding the little hierarchy problem ,",
    "it is well known that it can be alleviated if the higgs boson arises as the pseudo - goldstone boson of some spontaneously broken approximate global symmetry , a scenario known as little higgs  @xcite .",
    "it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that the combination of supersymmetry and of a global symmetry leads to an improved protection of the higgs potential .",
    "namely , the logarithmic dependence of the mssm higgs mass parameter on the cut - off scale is replaced by a dependence on the scale of spontaneous global symmetry breaking , thus reducing the need for a fine - tuning .",
    "explicit realizations of this idea of double protection  @xcite of the higgs potential by supersymmetry and by a global symmetry have shown that a fine - tuning smaller than 10% can be achieved with squark masses around @xmath12 .    in this paper , we revisit these issues by combining gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking with a spontaneously broken global symmetry in the higgs sector .",
    "we consider a simple model with a global @xmath0 symmetry , which is essentially a gauge - mediated version of the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , and study it in detail .",
    "we pay particular attention to the spontaneous breaking of the global symmetry , and check whether the @xmath0-breaking minimum is the global minimum of the scalar potential . a key role in the process of global symmetry breaking",
    "is played by the tadpole of an @xmath0 singlet field , which is generated by loops of messenger fields together with the singlet soft terms .",
    "this tadpole also triggers the generation of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 parameters ; however they do not contribute to the potential of the lightest higgs doublet due to its ( pseudo-)goldstone boson nature . as a result , the higgsinos and the non - goldstone higgs scalars can be made heavy with masses of order @xmath13 without introducing a strong fine - tuning in the higgs potential .",
    "we then compute the one - loop effective potential of the pseudo - goldstone higgs doublet and study electroweak symmetry breaking . while the corrections to the pseudo - goldstone mass parameter are efficiently controlled by the joint effect of supersymmetry and of the global symmetry , allowing in principle the electroweak symmetry to be broken with little fine - tuning , the specific model studied in this paper fails to bring the higgs mass above the lep bound due to a suppressed tree - level quartic coupling . to cure this problem",
    ", we consider the possibility of additional @xmath0-breaking contributions to the higgs potential , and estimate the resulting fine - tuning .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : model ] , we describe the model and discuss the generation of the soft supersymmetry breaking terms via gauge mediation . in section  [ sec : su3_breaking ] , we study the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the global @xmath0 symmetry and find a region of the parameter space in which the desired vacuum is indeed the global minimum of the scalar potential .",
    "we then show how the @xmath1/@xmath2 problem is solved by the global symmetry .",
    "section  [ sec : ewsb ] deals with electroweak symmetry breaking , the higgs mass and fine - tuning .",
    "finally , we give our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the model we study in this letter is based on a supersymmetric version  @xcite of the `` simplest little higgs model '' of ref .",
    "we describe its general structure below , before discussing the generation of the soft supersymmetry breaking terms via gauge mediation .    in order to realize the higgs as pseudo - goldstone boson idea , a global @xmath0 symmetry spontaneously broken at the scale @xmath14",
    "is imposed on the higgs sector .",
    "the mssm higgs doublets @xmath15 and @xmath16 are extended to global @xmath0 ( anti-)triplets : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are electroweak singlets .",
    "similarly , all matter fields are extended to @xmath0 multiplets .",
    "the global symmetry is spontaneously broken by the vevs of @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the associated goldstone boson , which is identified with the standard model higgs boson @xmath20 , is a linear combination of the @xmath21 doublets @xmath15 and @xmath22 . by construction",
    ", the tree - level higgs potential does not contain a mass term for @xmath20 .",
    "however , the global @xmath0 symmetry of the higgs sector is not a symmetry of the full lagrangian : it is violated explicitly by the yukawa and gauge interactions of the mssm .",
    "these induce a one - loop potential for @xmath20 which , due to the combined effect of supersymmetry and of the approximate global @xmath0 symmetry , has no logarithmic dependence on the ultraviolet cut - off  @xcite . thanks to this softening of the radiative corrections , the lep higgs mass bound can be satisfied with less fine - tuning than in the mssm .    in order for this double protection mechanism to be operative , the gauge symmetry must be compatible with the global symmetry in the ultraviolet . to this end , the electroweak gauge symmetry @xmath23 is extended to @xmath24 , where @xmath25 .",
    "the breaking of the extended gauge group is achieved at some higher energy scale @xmath26 by two additional higgs ( anti-)triplets @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in this way , the masses of the heavy gauge bosons are unrelated to the global symmetry breaking scale @xmath29 , and experimental limits on them do not constrain it .",
    "it is then possible to choose @xmath29 around the tev scale , so as to minimize the fine - tuning in the higgs potential , without running into conflict with precision electroweak data  @xcite .",
    "the details of the model are presented below .",

    "the higgsinos ( both doublet and singlets ) also have large masses of order @xmath1 .",
    "the rest of the superpartner spectrum is representative of gauge - mediated models with a low messenger scale .",
    "the @xmath0 partner of the top quark has a mass @xmath297 in the region of parameter space considered and is not accessible at the lhc , similarly to the heavy gauge bosons associated with the broken @xmath24 generators .",
    "in this paper , we studied the interplay between the spontaneous breaking of a global symmetry of the higgs sector and gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking , in the framework of a supersymmetric model with global @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "in addition to solving the supersymmetric flavour problem and alleviating the little hierarchy problem by identifying the higgs boson with a pseudo - goldstone boson , this scenario presents several advantages .    first , gauge mediation provides a mechanism for breaking the global symmetry protecting the higgs mass , namely through the loop - induced tadpole of an @xmath0 singlet scalar field .",
    "a non - trivial success of the model studied in this paper , compared with previous attempts in the literature , is to ensure that the global symmetry breaking vacuum is indeed the global minimum of the scalar potential , and the possibility to control the shape of the potential by varying the tadpole scale is instrumental in this .",
    "second , the global symmetry provides an elegant solution to the @xmath1/@xmath2 problem of gauge mediation . much like in the nmssm ,",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath2 parameters are generated by the vevs of the scalar and f - term components of a singlet superfield , but the global @xmath0 symmetry ensures that the relation @xmath298 is satisfied at the minimum of the tree - level scalar potential , implying that the electroweak scale is insensitive to the actual value of the @xmath1 parameter . as a result",
    "the @xmath1 parameter , which sets the scale of the heavy higgs masses , may be large without creating a strong fine - tuning in the higgs potential .",
    "finally , the combined effect of supersymmetry and of the global symmetry ensures a `` double protection '' of the higgs potential , allowing for a reduced fine - tuning with respect to the mssm .",
    "we computed the one - loop corrections to the potential of the pseudo - goldstone higgs boson coming from the ( s)top and gauge - higgs sectors , and checked that they indeed trigger electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "however , the specific model studied in this paper has a suppressed tree - level quartic higgs coupling and fails to bring the higgs mass above the lep bound .",
    "we showed that an additional contribution @xmath280 to the higgs potential , arising from some extra @xmath0-breaking sector , can solve this problem with a moderate fine - tuning of order @xmath299 .",
