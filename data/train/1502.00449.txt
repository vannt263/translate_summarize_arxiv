    "in the first paper of this series , @xcite ( paper i henceforth ) , we have described extensions of the antares code ( @xcite ) which enable the investigation of the pulsation - convection interaction by numerically solving the equations of radiation - hydrodynamics with realistic microphysics and opacities .",
    "we now turn to the description and analysis of a 2d nonlinear cepheid model .",
    "while the first paper centered around technical issues , the present one concentrates on the physical properties of the convection zone caused by the ionisation of he  ii which also hosts much of the pulsational driving exhibited by the @xmath2-mechanism . to motivate this work we first discuss here a few items related to the physics of cepheid pulsations which explains the interest in the modelling of the pulsation - convection interaction .",
    "rewards from such work are expected in the course of time , both in the immediate and in the later future .",
    "the success of the effort put into modelling the pulsation - convection interaction has , to a large degree , been measured by the accuracy up to which properties of _ individual cepheids _ can be reproduced ( light curve , in particular also special features such as humps and bumps , etc . ) .",
    "there is now a large body of 1d simulations which are utilized in various astrophysical contexts .",
    "some problems and trends in cepheid research have been described in two reviews , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the status and progress in research on the related rr lyr stars has recently been reviewed by @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that both authors stress open problems in the treatment of pulsation - convection interaction . instead of repeating the problems discussed in those reviews we want to shortly describe a few problem areas which are either different from those discussed there or are considered here from a different point of view , and where better insights to the pulsation - convection interaction can expected to be crucial for progress .",
    "let us , first of all , point out that in the usual 1d simulations for those stars convection is modelled by simplified non - local , time - dependent models , specifically adapted to an environment varying due to the radial pulsations . generally , such models need some equation for the turbulent kinetic energy , and due to the variable environment at least a time evolution equation for the turbulent kinetic energy is necessary .",
    "this is in contrast to the possibly static equation for the turbulent energy which is applicable in stars which do not exhibit pulsation .",
    "see the discussion in @xcite where the most widely used models are described .",
    "these models require , however , to know a number of parameters , the so - called @xmath3 s , which are unknown a priori .",
    "typically , these parameters are calibrated so that models reproduce properties which those objects exhibit , for example , the existence and the location of the red edge of the pulsation instability strip .",
    "sometimes they are simply guessed .",
    "since the number of these parameters is , in addition , considerable , and even the form of the added equations or closure approximations may well be ambiguous concern must be expressed as to the reliability of this approach .    as a consequence ,",
    "these models must be tested and , if feasible , the parameters calibrated in different , independent ways .",
    "presently , it is not known to what extent the results obtained from conventional models are affected , at least in the case of cooler pulsating stars where effects due to convection are largest .",
    "it is therefore of interest to consider a specific problem where what had once been considered progress has again been challenged just on grounds of inappropriate modelling of convection : the ( 1d ) simulation of double mode cepheids .    in parameter regions where double mode behaviour is observed , nonlinear , radially symmetric models for pulsating stars have failed to reproduce such a behaviour for a long time .",
    "it has therefore been considered to be an important breakthrough when , ultimately , models did exhibit double mode pulsation indeed .",
    "these results have , however , been criticized by @xcite , where also references to other papers are given , on grounds of inappropriate modelling of convection , in particular because of much too large overshoot .",
    "indeed , the question of how to explain double mode pulsation in cepheids is now considered open again .",
    "quite generally , these closure parameters of the convection models are known to depend on effective temperature , chemical composition , etc .",
    ", insofar as they are can be determined at all with some reasonable reliability .",
    "this holds already true for the `` classical '' mixing - length parameter @xmath4 .",
    "consider for example the discussion in @xcite .",
    "increasingly , cepheids and related variables are used to investigate stellar populations , see , for example , @xcite .",
    "hence , a proper assessment of the validity of conclusions is becoming both more important and , because of the possible influence of differing chemical abundances on the mixing length and other parameters , more difficult .",
    "another emerging area of research is the detection of multiple periodicities present in some of these objects due to the advent of long , uninterrupted observations of high quality with the corot and kepler missions .",
    "the detection of nonradial modes , e.g. @xcite , amounts to new tasks for nonlinear modelling and in particular leads to the need for multidimensional simulations .",
    "let us also point out the usefulness of multidimensional cepheid and rr lyr studies for investigation of the atmospheres of these objects and the implications of such work .",
    "whereas in solar and in general stellar physics use is increasingly made of multidimensional model atmospheres for abundance analysis and other types of research , e.g. @xcite , static model atmospheres are predominantly used in work about cepheids with only few exceptions , e.g. @xcite .",
    "an appropriate treatment of the so - called projection factor which relates actual pulsation velocities to those observed turns out to be of importance in establishing the rotation law of the galaxy and issues regarding cepheid distance scale calibration ( cf .",
    "quite generally , the increasingly sophisticated analysis of light curves of cepheids and rr lyr stars , e.g. @xcite , should be backed up by a comparable sophistication of atmospheric models , therefore possibly hydrodynamical and , if convection is important , multidimensional models .    with these long - term goals in mind",
    "we present in this paper 2d hydrodynamical models of a cepheid .",
    "as discussed already in paper i , the vastly different spatial scales and therefore stringent resolution requirements make this a computationally quite intensive task even in 2d . in the following we investigate properties of the he  ii partial ionisation zone , in particular issues regarding the energetics of the convection and the overshoot zone and implications for modelling of convection done in the traditional way in this area ( models of such a sort that they fit into the framework of the geometrically one dimensional hydrodynamic modelling of radially pulsating stars ) , and",
    "we discuss issues of the atmospheric structure and numerical complications which are not so severe in low resolution and show their full relevance only in high resolution simulations .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organised as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : models ] we describe the physical parameters of the cepheid which we model with our simulations .",
    "the analysis of the enthalpy flux in and around the partial ionisation zone of he  ii and the mechanical work performed by the pulsation over a complete cycle as well as the comparison of these quantities with predictions from time - dependent convection models is presented in sect .",
    "[ sec : pulsation ] . in sect .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we provide a discussion of our results and present our conclusions .",
    "the model we discuss in this paper corresponds to a fundamental tone cepheid .",
    "its parameters have already been given in paper i. we repeat them here for convenience .",
    "our star has an effective temperature of @xmath5 and a gravitational acceleration at its surface of @xmath6 .",
    "its luminosity is @xmath7 , the initial radius is @xmath8 ( which is about @xmath9 ) , and the total stellar mass amounts to @xmath10 .",
    "the chemical composition is characterized by @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the mix for @xmath13 being taken from @xcite . the outer 11.3 gm are modelled . as a result the pulsation period @xmath14 measured from our simulations is about 3.85 days which is slightly shorter than if one included the entire star in the computational domain .",
    "the present work is based on a model whose sector has an opening angle of @xmath15 .",
    "the vertical cell size ranges from @xmath16 at the top to 124 mm at the bottom .",
    "further details on the numerical parameters for the model and on the numerical methods used to solve the dynamical equations as well as a description of the dynamical equations themselves are given in paper  i.",
    "in this section we discuss properties of the he  ii of the model just mentioned .",
    "this work is based on data covering ten useful pulsation periods after model relaxation .",
    "averaging over ten periods allows for a sufficient removal of special properties of individual periods .",
    "after all , a problem typically experienced when running 2d convection simulations the small number of plumes present at any given time unless the domain is very broad .",
    "this makes for poor statistics compared to 3d runs with similar horizontal extent .",
    "the he  ii zone is well resolved in each of the models we consider in the following .",
    "given the importance of convection modelling in traditional ( 1d ) cepheid calculations naturally great efforts have been undertaken to derive such models .",
    "the most frequently used models are those of @xcite and of @xcite as well as a number of variants based on them .",
    "convection modelling in the sense of kuhfu has been adopted with modifications in the code described by @xcite .",
    "variants of the stellingwerf model and the kuhfu model have been used in codes such as those of @xcite and the florida - budapest cooperation ( e.g @xcite ) and also in the more recent code described in @xcite .",
    "these convection models introduce one additional time - dependent differential equation for the turbulent kinetic energy density , @xmath17 , plus algebraic recipes for various physical quantities .",
    "more elaborate convection models using the reynolds stress approach have been developed , in particular those of @xcite and @xcite , but they have not yet been integrated into @xmath18 nonlinear stellar pulsation codes .",
    "the comparably complex model of @xcite has been used to study the pulsational stability of red giants , but only at the level of providing the background model for linear , nonadiabatic stability analyses ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore concentrate on examining the prescriptions of the kuhfu and stellingwerf models .",
    "one of the differences between these models is the way in which the convective flux is expressed from the basic quantities , i.e. , those derived from the navier - stokes equations plus @xmath17 .",
    "errors in the prediction of the convective flux may stem from two sources : from errors in @xmath17 itself ( and therefore the basic equation for this quantity ) and from an inadequate algebraic expression used to calculate the convective flux @xmath19 . in the tests performed here",
    "we compute @xmath17 from our @xmath20 simulations and thus we test the algebraic form for @xmath19 . for two reasons",
    "this is the proper way to proceed in the present context .",
    "the first is a physical one and the other is of a primarily numerical nature .",
    "the _ physical _ reason is conected with the formulation of the time dependent convection ( tdc ) equation . in the form given by @xcite",
    "it reads @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the turbulent pressure and @xmath23 is the viscous eddy pressure .",
    "@xmath24 is the flux of turbulent kinetic energy and @xmath25 is a coupling term of the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes a source term and @xmath28 is the dissipation rate of the ( turbulent ) kinetic energy .",
    "both the viscous eddy pressure @xmath29 and the dissipation rate @xmath30 concern actions on a very small scale and in actual practice can not be computed without model assumptions concerning just those small scale processes . from the standpoint of @xmath20 or @xmath31 modelling that means , however , that these quantities can not readily or unambiguously be recovered from the numerical simulations .",
    "after all , the latter contain information about the resolved scales only .",
    "the hope and expectation ( which to a considerable extent was supported e.g. by simulations of solar granulation ) in connection with such models is that they deliver useful and reliable answers even if the parameters ( reynolds number , rayleigh number , etc . ) in the numerical models differ widely from those found in actual objects ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . at the same time",
    "it should be kept in mind that eq .",
    "( [ eq : eturb ] ) in itself is phenomenological only .",
    "it is in at least one way connected with simplified expressions for @xmath28 and connected to the kolmogorov dissipation picture as described in @xcite . however , eq .  ( [ eq : eturb ] ) is not built into the multidimensional simulations .    considered from a more basic point of view , eq .",
    "( [ eq : eturb ] ) is not conservative .",
    "moreover it can not be brought into that form with the approximate associated expressions for @xmath28 and @xmath27 .",
    "the physical reason for this is that turbulent kinetic energy considered on its own is simply not a conserved quantity : there has to be a source of turbulent kinetic energy to prevent it from decaying . in the models used in practice the source and dissipation terms",
    "are , from a quite fundamental point of view , not provided in conservation form . on the other hand , our numerical methodology in antares rests on conservation form .",
    "this is for the very good reason that in hydrodynamics only conservation form can be expected to deliver correct answers for shock speeds and the like ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . nevertheless , even if we chose to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : eturb ] ) alongside , it would not have the same , or any , backreaction on our simulations because it is not one of the dynamic equations we solve .",
    "it would therefore concern a quantity different from that one appearing in the tdc models despite of a formal , superficial analogy .    therefore , similar to @xcite",
    ", we undertake a direct comparison of the convective flux between the numerical hydrodynamical simulations and its approximation provided by the tdc models .",
    "each of the tdc based fluxes has the form @xmath32 here , @xmath33 is @xmath34 for kuhfu and @xmath35 for stellingwerf .",
    "@xmath36 is a correction factor whose purpose is to account for radiative energy losses of the convective elements . for the kuhfu and the stellingwerf case a slightly different functional form",
    "is used ( see below ) .",
    "@xmath36 contains , among others , the peclet number @xmath37 , which , again , is calculated somewhat differently in the kuhfu and in the stellingwerf setting .",
    "our use of @xmath38 complies with @xcite .",
    "note that e.g. @xcite use a somewhat different way to write the factor .",
    "the functions @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath36 depend on the depth . in the _ stellingwerf _ model @xmath41 is computed from @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "it furthermore adopts @xmath44 with a peclet number computed from the following expression : @xmath45 this form was proposed in @xcite ( see sect .",
    "5.3 therein ) originally with the model of kuhfu in mind , although at this level the expressions for the convective flux have the same general structure ( [ eq : flux ] ) for both the stellingwerf and the kuhfu models . in ( [ eq :",
    "eta_sw ] ) , @xmath46 is a parameter , unknown from the outset , @xmath47 is the rosseland mean opacity , @xmath48 the stefan  boltzmann constant and @xmath49 the temperature .",
    "moreover , @xmath50 is the usual heat capacity at constant pressure , @xmath51 denotes the density , @xmath17 the turbulent kinetic energy density , and @xmath52 stands for the pressure scale height . finally , @xmath53 is the superadiabatic temperature gradient , @xmath54 and @xmath55 denotes the actual temperature gradient @xmath56 while @xmath57 is the adiabatic temperature gradient .",
    "for the _ kuhfu _ model we have @xmath58 to demonstrate the effect of radiative losses on the kuhfu model if approximated as in @xcite we introduce here a factor @xmath59 which contains some parameter @xmath60 . again",
    ", it influences the efficiency with which the model diffuses surplus energy of convective elements and it is assumed to be of the form @xmath61 the peclet number for the kuhfu model is computed from @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the radiative conductivity .",
    "this is the expression for @xmath64 derived by @xcite for the case that the dissipation rate @xmath28 is computed by means of a mixing length @xmath65 in the special case @xmath66 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : eta_kf ] ) can be transformed into eq .",
    "( [ eq : eta_sw ] ) : the role of @xmath60 is reversed between the two , i.e.@xmath67 while @xmath68 .",
    "consequently , all the differences between eq .",
    "( [ eq : eta_sw ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : eta_kf ] ) can be absorbed into the numerical value for @xmath60 and the two forms of computing @xmath69 are equivalent .",
    "( [ eq : eta_kf ] ) has the advantage of a more straightforward comparison with the model of @xcite and extensions thereof in future work .",
    "we note that more detailed prescriptions to compute radiative losses within the kuhfu model itself have been suggested by @xcite , which , however , quite closely couple the computation of the convective flux with the dynamical equation for @xmath17 . in this study",
    "we limit ourselves to the prescription given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : flux ] ) which can readily be applied to both tdc models , as intended by @xcite .",
    "last but not least we also compute the convective flux from our simulations through @xmath70 here @xmath71 is the vertical convective velocity ( the radial velocity after subtraction of the radial pulsational velocity ) and @xmath72 the enthalpy .      in order to compare the fluxes used in traditional cepheid modelling with those from our simulations and relating them to the actual convective fluxes as calculated form the simulations we have averaged the latter ones over ten useful pulsation periods . in this way we improve the statistics .",
    "after all , it is known that 2d simulations have disadvantages regarding statistics compared to 3d simulations due to the small number of convective plumes present at any given instance of time unless the domain is very wide . for each of the results we discuss in this section",
    "the fluxes have been averaged horizontally .",
    "[ fig : convflux ] displays the convective flux plotted against phase ( averaged over ten periods ) .",
    "the variation of convection in intensity as a function of the phase is clearly visible . as fig .",
    "[ pic : fc3 ] shows , convective activity ( as witnessed by convective flux ) commences its activity high up in the convectively unstable layer .",
    "subsequently , plumes descend downwards . while their effect is still recognizable deep down ( in the overshoot zone , in fact ) , new convective activity again sets in at the top of the he  ii partial ionisation zone .",
    "the two subfigures in fig .",
    "[ fig : convflux ] display two variants of the convective flux , namely @xmath73 , based on entropy perturbation against the mean , in fig .",
    "[ pic : fc3 ] , and @xmath74 in fig .",
    "[ pic : fc2 ] , where the total enthalpy enters ( cf .",
    "[ eq : flux ] ) . in the upper picture",
    "there is a noticeable orange - coloured streak , corresponding to plumes directed downwards , in particular in the overshoot region .",
    "they have a large negative value of velocity , and @xmath75 because they are hotter than the ambience in the overshoot region .",
    "this leads to a large positive value of @xmath73 , but to a negative value for @xmath19 .",
    "in fig .  [",
    "fig : flux tot domain ] the mean convective flux @xmath19 is compared to its approximation provided by the tdc models over the total computational domain .",
    "the left panel refers to the kuhfu and stellingwerf fluxes without the correction factor , which amounts to @xmath76 . in the panel to the right the correction factor is included .",
    "similiar to the findings in @xcite , but less pronounced , the kuhfu formulation overestimates the convective flux in the overshooting region also in our case .",
    "partial remedy can be achieved by including the peclet - factor @xmath77 as is evident from fig .",
    "[ pic : phieta ] .",
    "the results based on the stellingwerf model turn out to be only weakly dependent on the peclet correction . ",
    "the approximations also predict a slight negative overshooting above the convection zone .",
    "the transition from convection to overshooting occurs closer to the surface than for the convective flux proper .  in all figures and tables hereafter the peclet - factor will therefore be included .",
    "[ fig : alpha_stripes ] shows @xmath78 as a function of phase for one full period ( actually even from phase -0.2 to 1.2 for clearer representation ) .",
    "@xmath78 is obtained from @xmath79 .",
    "the reddish vertical stripes represent the upper and lower limits , respectively , of the he  ii convection zone proper quite well .",
    "a systematic variation of @xmath40 with both the depth in the convection zone and with pulsation phase is immediately apparent .",
    "furthermore , comparing corresponding values from the convection zone and the overshoot zone , one can easily spot phases where the @xmath40-values differ by a factor 5 - 15 and hence by an order of magnitude .",
    "[ pic : kf - stripe ] [ pic : sw - stripe ]    we therefore need to investigate the coefficients @xmath78 as a function of phase separately averaged over the convection zone and the overshooting zone . to this end",
    "the following procedure has proved reliable and useful to determine whether a depth point belongs , at a given instant of time , either to the convection zone or the overshooting zone or to neither of them .",
    "a layer belongs to the _ convection zone _ if , at this depth , more than @xmath80 percent of the horizontal points have a positive superadiabatic gradient , @xmath81 .",
    "the gradients are computed from local values .",
    "points below the convection zone belong to the _ overshooting region _ if they satisfy @xmath82 and fulfill , in addition , @xmath83 .",
    "this choice guarantees both for the convection zone and the overshooting zone that the upper and lower boundary of the convection zone are excluded . near these boundaries the convective flux changes sign and hence is practically @xmath84 so that the ratio @xmath85 requested for the evaluation of @xmath0 ( cf . fig .",
    "[ eq : flux ] ) leads to meaningless results . moreover",
    ", in this region the enthalpy flux is small and the ratio @xmath85 is physically unimportant .",
    "inspection of the simulation data shows that the overshooting region defined in this way nicely contains the downwards penetrating plumes .",

    "[ fig : workintegrand ] the work integrands are plotted for the fluctuating velocity . when comparing to fig .",
    "[ fig : flux tot domain ] it can be seen that for the thermodynamic pressure dampening occurs at the top of the convection zone and that the transition from excitation to dampening is within the overshooting zone .",
    "the turbulent pressure has a dampening effect throughout where it is not small .",
    "these work densities can then be integrated , at any time , over the convection zone ( @xmath87 ) , the overshooting zone ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "for the present purpose the definition of the convection zone is the same as given in sect .",
    "[ sec : flux_properties ] .",
    "the overshooting zone is now defined a little bit differently from the one provided there .",

    "while simulations of pulsating stars ( cepheids , rr lyr ) have been computationally one - dimensional for decades , assuming radial symmetry , multidimensional calculations start to be feasible only recently .",
    "they allow in particular the investigation of the pulsation - convection interaction which is considered a main open problem in the simulation of such stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have constructed a two - dimensional model regarding convection and pulsation in a cepheid type star .",
    "the justification for adopting two dimensions at the present state of the matter can be taken from a comparison of 2d and 3d results in @xcite .",
    "these results show that ( for models off rr lyr stars ) many quantities such as peak convective flux as a function of phase , growth rates or amplitudes are quite similar in 2d and 3d , differences being mainly visible in the slope of the light curve at various times in the descending branch .",
    "the aim of our investigation is to figure out basic properties of convection in the presence of pulsation and to draw inferences on existing ways of modelling these issues via time dependent convection models ( tdcs ) in a computationally 1d setting .",
    "the tdcs just mentioned entail a number of coefficients not priorly known .",
    "with respect to the coefficient @xmath98 , the calibration factor for obtaining the physically correct convective flux values from the tdc models of kuhfu and stellingwerf , the following conclusions can be drawn from our work .    in the he  ii partial ionisation zone and its surrounding overshooting zone convection is subject to large radiative losses , as is witnessed by a low peclet number ( @xmath99 predominantly ) .",
    "it is thus difficult to calibrate @xmath0 separately from a coefficient @xmath60 , connected to radiative losses , at least from our present model .",
    "after all , as explained in sect .  3.1 ,",
    "these coefficients enter essentially only in the combination @xmath100 ( or @xmath101 in case of the stellingwerf model ) for our case of low peclet numbers .",
    "our models show that using one and the same coefficient @xmath0 for the convection zone ( c.z . ) and the overshoot zone ( o.z . ) would result in much too large overshooting predicted by the tdcs .",
    "however , @xmath0 and @xmath60 enter only in the combination described in sec .",
    "[ sec : flux_properties ] .",
    "consequently , including radiative losses by any choice of @xmath60 in the prescription for the convective flux can not correct the discrepancy of too large fluxes predicted by the model expressions for the overshooting zone in comparison with the interior of the convection zone . at present , the main effect of accounting for radiative losses , i.e. introducing the factor @xmath69 in eq .",
    "( 3 ) , is to at least limit a more excessive overshooting which would otherwise result from applying the prescription of kuhfu ( see fig .",
    "this model is more affected by that problem than the model of stellingwerf .",
    "accounting for the change of anisotropy of the contributions to turbulent kinetic energy , however , is much more important . to avoid excessive",
    "overshooting in the model requires introducing a functional dependence in eq .",
    "( 3 ) which can take care of the fact that convective zones show stronger vertical fluxes than horizontal ones while the opposite holds for overshooting zones .    however , as we have shown , even after such corrections a large discrepancy remains .",
    "this requires to at least vary @xmath102 by a factor of 1.5 for the stellingwerf model and a factor of 4 for the kuhfu model to obtain convective fluxes from the models which are consistent with our numerical simulations .",
    "in addition , there is a clear systematic trend of @xmath98 as a function of depth within the convection zone , see fig .  [",
    "fig : alpha_stripes ] .",
    "the effect of this trend on modelling the pulsation in the traditional way is unknown .",
    "some contribution to this might actually be due to the coupling between the mean structure and the turbulent kinetic energy which is certainly more complex than expressed through eq .",
    "we should mention that the present comparison is already the most favorable one for the tdc models in the sense that we only take the model expressions to be meant to predict statistical averages : variations for particular instants of phase for a specific point in time may be larger and any attempt to interpret the expressions in a point - wise sense is falsified immediately by unacceptably large discrepancies ( at least two orders of magnitudes larger than the already large differences observed for the averaged quantities considered here ) .    in this sense",
    "the present simulations unveil major weaknesses of tdc models used to explain the pulsational properties of cepheids .",
    "the present simulations allow to quantify the discrepancies expected from the tdc models for a certain group of cepheids .",
    "since idealized simulations such as those of @xcite come to similar conclusions on a qualitative level , the discrepancies found are most likely of a fundamental nature and thus have to be taken care of .",
    "otherwise one may fall into the trap of obtaining the right results for what might be the wrong reasons .",
    "our results suggest that in 1d simulations one gets artificially large overshooting below the convection zone when applying identical values of @xmath0 in the c.z . and the o.z .. this reinforces the doubts which have been expressed by @xcite in respect to the achievements on double mode pulsation in 1d cepheid models .",
    "these doubts are based on the suspicion of too large overshooting in the models which have shown double mode pulsation in a broader parameter range than previously .",
    "one additional point is that 2d simulations tend to lead to larger overshooting than similar 3d simulations produce ( @xcite ) . considering this aspect as well",
    ", the problem of depth - dependency of @xmath0 may well be even more severe than is borne out by the present investigation .",
    "our results regarding the contribution of fluctuating quantities to the work integral reveal an intricate change of correlations as a function of phase . in table  [",
    "tab : pw - values ] we compare values of the contributions to the work integral , integrated over the convection zone , and the overshoot zone .",
    "considering contributions to the work integral where both entering quantities are fluctuating ones ( instead of corresponding to the radial symmetric component ) it turns out that no such combination can be disregarded : at least for one domain of integration every combination leads to a contribution of the same size as the others .",
    "that means that in principle each tdc model should faithfully represent the terms corresponding to all of the possible combinations ( plus those with just one fluctuating quantity of course ) .",
    "it can be expected that work integral contributions with two fluctuating quantities will be more important in cases of stronger convection zones , since due to the more pronounced nonlinearity , their higher order terms will likely be larger .",
    "a comparison of our simulations to tdc models regarding the energetics of the pulsation - convection interaction can not be undertaken in the same manner as has been possible for the @xmath3-factors discussed above .",
    "there , the relevant flux as delivered by the tdc models can , by a simple algebraic formula , directly be evaluated and the scaling factor be determined ; the constancy or variability of this factor then immediately leads to an assessment of the quality .",
    "this is to be contrasted to the case of the work integral .",
    "there , the relevant quantities in the tdc ( turbulent energy or pressure plus furthermore others , not really provided by the usual tdcs ) are not algebraic in nature . instead , the equation for turbulent energy is an evolution equation where @xmath103 attains a value deemed physically correct only after it has been evolving for some time .",
    "hence , comparison to the quantities from the multidimensional simulations can not be performed on the basis of a temporal snapshot . at the same time it is not really possible to include an equation for the turbulent energy @xmath103 in the multidimensional simulations : the simulations explicitly _ calculate _ @xmath103 while the equation for turbulent energy in the tdcs _ models _ @xmath103 .",
    "consequently , there is a branching quite at the roots of the modelling processes between one- and multidimensional simulations which prevents a meaningful comparison of the two values of @xmath103 by solving the tdc equation alongside in multidimensional work .",
    "after all , there is no room to allow for backreaction of the tdc variant of @xmath103 in multidimensions . ",
    "our calculations however show that , for modelling these values in the sense of tdcs , phase dependent properties of hydrodynamic quantities ought to be built into the models . after all",
    ", the contributions to the work integral ( which are related to correlations of physical quantities ) have a distinctive phase dependence which , moreover , is not in all cases similar in the convection and the overshoot zone .",
    "this can not really come as a surprise given that convection in a pulsating star is not in a statistically steady state .",
    "rather , it continually evolves in a specific way : at first convection cells form at the top of the convection zone at a certain phase , plumes then descend , overshoot into the stable zone below at some later phase and ultimately the remnants die off deep below the convection zone . explicitly or implicitly ,",
    "each tdc should account for such a sequence of events .",
    "the simulations reported above suggest some guidelines for the development of revised tdcs to eventually be used in 1d simulations .",
    "radiative losses have to be included in the model , but in addition the convective flux will have to evolve in an explicitly phase dependent manner .",
    "therefore an additional evolution equation for @xmath104 seems inevitable , similar to the model of @xcite , further developed in @xcite , or the rarely used 3-equation variant of the kuhfu model .",
    "moreover , the distribution of kinetic energy clearly changes as a function of depth in a non - trivial manner and most likely also features phase dependencies .",
    "thus , a fully non - local reynolds stress model as given by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite may be required as a minimum level of complexity to substantially improve tdc models in comparison to those presently used .",
    "when finally turning our attention to further work along these lines , several items come to mind .",
    "one obvious goal consists in the construction of cepheid models with a stronger he  ii convection zone in order to more fully sample the parameter space .",
    "such material may be crucial for improved tdcs for use by the 1d pulsation modelling community .",
    "one further goal is an investigation of the upper , h+hei , convection zone and , hence , the atmosphere .",
    "we have already performed some initial runs with the necessary resolution which is considerably higher in the upper layers than in the models which we have reported here . due to the fact that , with higher resolution , the h+hei convection zone is much stronger than in our present models",
    "we have had some difficulty with the higher resolution models . in particular",
    ", throughout the atmosphere ( and also below ) there is vivid non - radial shock activity .",
    "this has lead to numerical problems which required the development of numerically suitable boundary conditions .",
    "such conditions were devised in the context of solar granulation ( @xcite ) .",
    "a modification of these conditions has recently been found to work for the cepheid case .",
    "shock activity with shocks up to a mach number of about 4 , triggered by convection , has also been found in preliminary calculations we have done with these new conditions . this highly dynamical situation in the atmosphere of the cepheid model also leads to a highly corrugated optical surface .",
    "to describe such a situation by a static or even a time - dependent model one - dimensional seems extremely challenging , and the implications for an analysis of photometric or spectroscopic data will need to be figured out .",
    "a different avenue of research could center on investing pulsation in a ring ( or , in 3d , a spherical shell ) as initiated in preliminary work ( @xcite ) .",
    "such simulations could shed light on the excitation of non - radial modes if they indeed show up , connected or not connected with convection , whatever the outcome of the simulations would be .",
    "this work has been supported by the austrian science foundation , fwf grant p18224 .",
    "we are thankful to g. houdek for supplying us with starting models .",
    "calculations have been performed at the vsc cluster of the vienna universities .",
