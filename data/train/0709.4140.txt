    "the dynamical modes of an meb were described by considering the motion of the helium surface ( ripplons ) and the vibrational modes of the electrons together . in particular , the case when the ripplopolarons form a wigner lattice was analyzed in ref .",
    "the interaction energy between the ripplons and the electrons in the multielectron bubble is derived from the following considerations : ( i ) the distance between the layer electrons and the helium surface is fixed ( the electrons find themselves confined to an effectively 2d surface anchored to the helium surface ) and ( ii ) the electrons are subjected to a force field , arising from the electric field of the other electrons . to study the ripplopolaron wigner lattice at nonzero temperature and for any value of the electron - ripplon coupling , the variational path - integral approach @xcite is used .    in their treatment of the electron wigner lattice embedded in a polarizable medium , such as a semiconductor or an ionic solid , fratini and qumerais @xcite described the effect of the electrons on a particular electron through a mean - field lattice potential .",
    "the ( classical ) lattice potential @xmath128 is obtained by approximating all the electrons acting on one particular electron by a homogenous charge density in which a hole is punched out ; this hole is centered in the lattice point of the particular electron under investigation and has a radius given by the lattice distance @xmath129 .",
    "the lindemann melting criterion @xcite states in general that a crystal lattice of objects ( be it atoms , molecules , electrons , or ripplopolarons ) will melt when the average displacement of the objects from their lattice site is larger than a critical fraction @xmath130 of the lattice parameter @xmath129 .",
    "it would be a strenuous task to calculate , from first principles , the exact value of the critical fraction @xmath130 , but for the particular case of electrons on a helium surface , we can make use of an experimental determination .",
    "grimes and adams @xcite found that the wigner lattice melts when @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the ratio of potential energy to the kinetic energy per electron . at temperature @xmath15 the average kinetic energy of an electron in a lattice potential @xmath128 , characterized by the frequency parameter @xmath133 , is @xmath134 and the average distance that an electron moves out of the lattice site is determined by @xmath135 from this one finds that for the melting transition in grimes and adams experiment @xcite , the critical fraction equals @xmath136 . this estimate is in agreement with previous ( empirical ) estimates yielding @xmath137 @xcite .    within the approach of fratini and qumerais @xcite , the wigner lattice of ( ripplo)polarons melts when at least one of the two following lindemann criteria are met : @xmath138@xmath139 where @xmath140 and @xmath141 are , respectively , the relative coordinate and the center of mass coordinate of the model system : if @xmath142 is the electron coordinate and @xmath143 is the position coordinate of the fictitious ripplon mass @xmath144 , they are @xmath145 the appearance of two lindemann criteria takes into account the composite nature of ( ripplo)polarons . as follows from the physical meaning of the coordinates @xmath140 and @xmath141 , the first criterion ( [ lind1 ] )",

    ", the destruction of the ripplopolaron wigner lattice in a meb occurs through the dissociation of ripplopolarons , since the second criterion ( [ lind2 ] ) will be fulfilled before the first ( [ lind1 ] ) .",

    "this critical pressure is nearly independent of the number of electrons ( except for the smallest bubbles ) and is weakly temperature dependent , up to the helium critical temperature 5.2 k. this can be understood since the typical lattice potential well in which the ripplopolaron resides has frequencies of the order of thz or larger , which correspond to @xmath152 k.    the new phase that was predicted in @xcite , the ripplopolaron wigner lattice , will not be present for electrons on a flat helium surface . at the values of the pressing field necessary to obtain a strong enough electron - ripplon coupling , the flat helium surface is no longer stable against long - wavelength deformations @xcite .",
