    "the associated production of invisible particles and hadronic jets is distinctive of a large number of the topical scenarios currently investigated at hadron colliders .",
    "the prototypical particle that goes undetected in collider experiments is the neutrino .",
    "neutrinos , which are produced in large part of the electroweak processes , interact only through the weak force , and their passage is inferred indirectly from the imbalance of the total transverse energy of the final state particles .",
    "final states including neutrinos and quarks are of large interest in a variety of measurement or searches ; a notable example is the search for the associated production of an higgs boson and a @xmath0 boson , in events where the higgs boson decays to a @xmath1 pair , and the @xmath0 boson decays to two neutrinos@xcite .",
    "many physics scenarios beyond the standard model predict the existence of particles with such a low interaction cross section to result in an imbalance in total transverse energy . among these",
    ", the quest for dark matter is a crucial topic in high energy physics field .",
    "searches at colliders can take advantage of jets from initial state radiation to explore direct dark matter production@xcite .",
    "recent experimental work suggest that these kind of searches can provide complementary information with respect to direct experiments on the mass and cross section of the hypothetical dark matter particles @xcite .",
    "another example is supersymmetry , which provides a whole new spectrum of particles , the lightest of which have to be stable , neutral and non strong - interacting .",
    "events with production of squarks or gluinos are expected to include strong - interacting sm particles in the final state , to conserve the color charge , together with lightest supersymmetric particles , resulting in missing transverse momentum plus jets signatures .    in all instances ,",
    "the presence of undetected particles is signaled in collider detectors by an imbalance in the transverse momentum of the final products , which is generally measured with the use of calorimeters and is traditionally referred to , in literature , as  missing transverse energy \" ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the presence of large missing transverse energy is a distinctive feature of all the signatures we have cited , allowing to significantly reduce the contribution of the generic production of strong - interacting particles through the more mundane quantum chromodynamics , ( _ i.e._qcd background ) .",
    "still , the presence of qcd is unavoidable due to calorimeter resolution effects .",
    "the challenging and hostile environment for invisible particle detection at hadron colliders thus calls for the need of innovative detection procedures . in this work",
    "we analyze the performance of a novel invisible particle detection technique , which is based on track information for evaluation of undetected particles momentum .",
    "new techniques for this purpose are needed in particular for kinematics in which the invisible particles in the final state carry low transverse momentum , because this imply low @xmath2 .",
    "for example , one of the last supersymmetric scenario not ruled out by lhc data is the one where the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle is one of the 3rd generation squarks , the stop ( @xmath3 ) and sbottom ( @xmath4 ) , the lightest being the neutralinos@xcite .",
    "after their pair production , @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) would likely decay to a top ( bottom ) quark and a neutralino @xmath5 that goes undetected .",
    "this signature is particularly difficult to investigate if the difference between @xmath6 and @xmath7 + @xmath8 ( @xmath9 + @xmath8 ) is small , because in this case the decay products have low momentum .",
    "the fact that experimentalists tend to use very stringent cuts on the event missing transverse energy , in order to reduce the qcd background , drastically reduce sensitivity in this region of the susy parameters space ( see@xcite as an example ) .",
    "dark matter searches face the same problem if the mass of the dark matter particle is @xmath10100 gev/@xmath11 because in this case large fraction of the collisional energy becomes mass .",
    "together with the lower production cross section , this makes collider experiments less sensitive than direct detection experiments for dark matter masses higher than few tens of gev/@xmath11 , even in the case in which the direct detection bounds are limited by a spin - dependent cross section hypothesis @xcite .",
    "the use of qcd rejection techniques like the one we describe in the following could help extend experimental limits to these unexplored regions , since collider experiments are much less limited by the spin - dependent hypothesis .    in all these cases , since the expected @xmath2 is relatively low , square cuts on @xmath2 at trigger level would not succeed to efficiently reject qcd background , maintaining at the same time high efficiency on the signal .",
    "therefore , new techniques to identify , reject and eventually model the qcd background are needed to extend limits in these regions of the phase space .",
    "the cdf ii detector has been extensively described elsewhere in the literature @xcite .",
    "the detector is cylindrically symmetric around the @xmath12 beam line ; a magnetic spectrometer consisting of tracking devices inside a 3-m diameter , 5-m long superconducting solenoidal magnet with an axial magnetic field of 1.4 t measures the momenta and trajectories of charged particles . a five layer double - sided silicon microstrip detector ( svx ) covers the region between 2.5 to 11 cm from the beam axis .",
    "three separate svx barrel modules along the beam line cover a length of 96 cm , approximately 90% of the luminous beam interaction region .",
    "three of the five layers combine an r-@xmath13 measurement on one side and a 90@xmath14 stereo measurement on the other , and the remaining two layers combine an r-@xmath13 measurement with small angle stereo at @xmath151.2@xmath14 .",
    "the typical silicon hit resolution is 11 @xmath16 m .",

    "drift chambers located outside the central hadronic calorimeters and behind a 60 cm thick iron shield detect muons with @xmath18 0.6 , while muons in the region between 0.6 @xmath21 1.0 pass through at least four drift layers lying in a conic section outside of the central calorimeter . in both cases ,",

    "the transverse projection of the tower energies ( see sect.[met_mpt ] ) are calculated with the assumption that the event primary vertex is located at @xmath29 .",
    "the missing energy at l1 has poor resolution , due to a limited available information and the need to make a fast decision , and is usually underestimated . at level 2 , the xft tracks with @xmath30 4 hits in svxii and @xmath31 2 gev / c are reconstructed taking advantage of the additional information from the silicon detector .",
    "algorithms can be applied to trigger electrons , photons or jets : the energy for clusters of adjacent towers , and the information from the detectors of maximum expansion of the shower in the electromagnetic calorimeters are now available .",
    "level 3 uses complete informations supplied from the various detectors .",
    "in particular , the tracking is completed executing the three - dimensional reconstruction of the trajectories in the volume @xmath18 2 , and more detailed algorithms reconstruct the energy in the calorimeters .",
    "the information provided by the cluster finding algorithm at the trigger level can be considered as a first - order jet reconstruction . at this level",
    ", a looser time constraint enables to exploit the full detector segmentation for a better jet energy and direction determination .",
    "since the discovery of the @xmath32 boson , the missing transverse energy has been a crucial tool in the search for new phenomena at hadron colliders .",
    "particle colliding at hadron colliders have equal and opposite momenta ; therefore , the total vector momentum sum in an event should be zero .",
    "the hard collision happens between the partons of the proton ( antiproton ) , where they can carry any fraction of the parent proton or antiproton momentum .",
    "however , in the plane transverse to the beam , the initial partons momentum - and thus final ones as well - can be treated as zero to a good approximation .",
    "any transverse energy imbalance in the detector may indicate that a particle left the detector without interacting with its material .",
    "missing transverse energy , @xmath2 , is defined as the magnitude of the vector    @xmath33    where @xmath34 are the magnitudes of transverse energy measured in each calorimetric tower @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the unit vector from the interaction vertex to the tower in the transverse @xmath37 plane . in order to maintain good resolution on both magnitude and direction of the missing transverse energy ,",
    "the detector calorimeter must be designed to be almost completely hermetic , within the mechanical allowance .",
    "the @xmath2 resolution is parametrized in terms of the total scalar energy deposited in the calorimeter ( @xmath38 ) , and is measured with minimum bias events , _",
    "i.e. _ events collected requiring hits in both clc counters , with no calorimeter requirements .",
    "no significant @xmath2 is expected in minimum bias events .",
    "a fit to these data yelds :    @xmath39    similarly to the case of the missing transverse energy , it is possible to define a missing transverse momentum @xmath40 using the charged particle spectrometer , as the negative vector sum of the charged particles momenta @xmath41 :    @xmath42    in events where only charged particles and undetected particles are produced , the @xmath40 is highly correlated in module and direction to the undetected particle(s ) momentum , and thus provide a way to measure their energy with potentially better resolution than @xmath43 .",
    "the presence of quarks / gluons in the final state complicates the picture . in the parton shower and hadronization process",
    "forming a jet , most particles produced are pions , with a smaller contribution of kaons . due to isospin symmetry , roughly 2/3 of the energy of a jet will be carried by charged particles , which will be measured with both calorimeter and tracking chamber .",
    "the @xmath44 underestimates the undetected particle s energy because it does not take into account the energy carried by the neutral components of the jets , and for the same reason has a worse angular resolution than @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , while calorimeter coverage is usually almost complete , the spectrometer coverage in collider detector is generally far more limited . for these reasons , @xmath40 can not substitute the role of the @xmath43 as a tool for the measurement of momentum and direction of undetected particles ; still , the @xmath40 can provide informations complementary to those given by @xmath43 .    in order to reconstruct the composite @xmath40 observable",
    ", we use as inputs to its computation the charged particle momentum reconstructed in the spectrometer .",
    "the basic track quality criteria for the calculation of @xmath40 are the same used for the reconstruction of the primary vertex at cdf",
    ". only tracks with 0.5 gev / c @xmath45 200 gev / c , @xmath18 1.5 and @xmath46 2 cm are used , where @xmath47 is the closest approach distance of the track from the primary vertex along the @xmath24 axis .",
    "we then classify the tracks in four different categories , on the basis of the number of axial ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) and stereo ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) cot and svx layers that have at least 5 hits , together the @xmath52 of the track fit .",
    "the first category fulfills strong requirements on the track reconstruction in the cot ; the second , third and fourth have decreasing requirements on cot compensated by requirements on the @xmath52 and on the svx hit layers . if the first category requirements fail , the second category is checked , then the third and finally the fourth .",
    "we use for the following studies 5.7 fb@xmath53 of data , collected requiring the presence of large @xmath2 and the presence of two or more energetic hadronic jets . at level 1 ,",
    "the trigger requires at least one trigger tower with @xmath54 gev , and a @xmath55 gev . at level 2 ,",
    "at least 2 calorimetric clusters with transverse energy above @xmath56gev and @xmath57 are required .",
    "the @xmath2 is recomputed with the additional available informations ; again , @xmath2 must be greater than 28 gev .",
    "finally , the level 3 performs the complete @xmath2 determination , requiring it to be greater than 30 gev .    events containing large @xmath2 can originate from non - collisional sources , such as cosmic or beam - halo muons passing the detector or noisy / dead calorimeter cells causing energy imbalance .",
    "these types of events are removed by requiring that the event observables indicate a presence of inelastic collision with large energy transfer , such as the presence of at least one high quality primary vertex in the collision .",
    "additional requirements are also imposed to remove events consistent with beam - halo muons traversing the detector or those caused by noisy calorimeter cells .",
    "we require the corrected @xmath2 to be larger than 50 gev , and we veto events containing at least one isolated electron or muon .",
    "we require the transverse momentum of the jet @xmath58 ( where @xmath35 runs over the total number of jets ) to be greater than 40 gev for dijet events , and greater than 30 , 20 and 15 gev respectively for ( @xmath59 1 , 2 ) , ( @xmath59 3 , 4 , 5 ) and ( @xmath60 5 ) for all other jet multiplicities . all jets must satisfy @xmath61 2.4 . with these selections , the qcd multijet production accounts for more than 95% of the data @xcite",
    "; for this reason , we will mostly use the data themselves to show the feature of the qcd background .    on the other hand , in order to describe the qualitative features of physics processes giving rise to undetectable particles in the final state , we use detailed monte carlo ( mc ) simulation interfaced to the detector response simulation . for simplicity , we restrict ourselves to the modeling of the @xmath62 boson plus jets production , and top quark pair production . as an example of interesting signal , we use here the associated production of a higgs ( @xmath63 ) boson together with a @xmath32 or a @xmath0 boson production @xmath64 , where the higgs boson decays to @xmath1 and the @xmath0 ( @xmath32 ) boson decays to @xmath65 ( @xmath66 )",

    "we generate dijet and trijet events with pythia .",
    "for all the simulated samples above , the detector response is modeled by a geant@xcite - based simulation of the cdf detector .",
    "the generic production of strong - interacting particles by quantum chromodynamics interactions between quarks and gluons is the most probable source of hadronic jets in the particle colliders . because of this , it is also the greatest source of backgrounds for searches which do not require leptons in the final state .",
    "qcd multijet production does not include undetectable particles , apart from small contributions from heavy quarks semileptonic decays , which produce neutrinos .",
    "missing transverse energy in these events , if correctly measured , is thus expected to be zero .",
    "this allows to significantly reduce the qcd multijet background for signatures including undetectable particles .",

    "the distributions of data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dphi_metmpt ] confirm the validity of this approach up to events with 7 jets or more , that is where cdf statistics run out .",
    "the use of mc to cross - check , as for 2 and 3 jets events , is not feasible for higher multiplicities ; in facts , because of the high production rate for qcd at a hadron collider and the large statistics needed in order to describe these processes adequately in an analysis of several inverse femtobarns of data , the simulation of an acceptable amount of qcd events is prohibitive .",
    "the varying instantaneous luminosity at hadron colliders poses a unique challenge to the online selection ( triggering ) of events characterized by large missing transverse energy and jets in the final state .",
    "in fact , larger instantaneous luminosity means more collisions per bunch - crossing .",
    "the most common collisions will give rise to quarks or gluons in the final state , and thus jets in the detector .",
    "these jets can add up to the missing transverse energy from the hard scatter , or can provide additional missing transverse energy if the energy of any or more than one of those is mismeasured in the detector .    in both cases , the pile - up of multiple scatters will constitute an additional background to the missing transverse energy plus jets signature .",
    "typical solutions proposed to cope with the unsustainable large trigger rates at increasing luminosity , have been to tighten the requirement of the absolute value of the missing transverse energy , or to tighten the requirement in the jet transverse energy , or both . while allowing to control the trigger rates , this procedure often reduces drastically the yields of the interesting signal .",
    "we argue in this section that the spectrometer can be helpful in suppressing the multiple scatter pile - up background in a similar fashion as proposed in suppressing the single - scatter qcd background .    to study the dependence of the @xmath44 on the instantanous luminosity",
    ", we choose as a proxy the number of primary collision vertices @xmath79 as reconstructed in the spectrometer .",
    "while this constitutes an approximation , since for any vertex reconstruction algorithm efficiency drops progressively as the luminosity increases , it is sufficient to understand the qualitative features of luminosity dependence .    analyzing the data for different numbers of interaction vertices is possible to appreciate the pile - up rejection power of a cut on @xmath44 .",
    "this can be particularly interesting in a lhc context , where the far higher instantaneos luminosity makes extremely important to control this source of background .",
    "[ fig : nvtx ] shows the @xmath2 , @xmath44 and @xmath73 distributions dependence from the number of vertices for the whole data sample ( _ i .",
    "e. _ for any number of jets ) . as can be seen , after fixing a certain online cut on @xmath2 , the offline @xmath2 has only a mild dependence on the number of primary vertices . on the other hand ,",
    "the pile - up events tend clearly to populate the region with qcd - like characteristics , _",
    "i.e. _ at low-@xmath44 and simmetrically in the @xmath73 distribution .     from top to bottom : the @xmath2 , @xmath44 and @xmath73 distributions in events with varying number of interaction vertices .",
    "it is clear how the latter two plots show far better discrimination power toward the isolation of pile - up events with respect to the traditional cut on missing transverse energy , and can thus be used to control more efficiently the pile - up background .",
    "all plots are normalized to unit area.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]   from top to bottom : the @xmath2 , @xmath44 and @xmath73 distributions in events with varying number of interaction vertices .",

    "all plots are normalized to unit area.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]",
    "we stressed that the peculiar way qcd populates the @xmath73 distribution is by itself a powerful instrument to reduce the qcd background by a factor of two when cut at @xmath19/2 , with minimal signal loss .",
    "its implementation in more complex methods , like multivariate analysis , would maximize its impact .",
    "we argued , assisted by a mc simulation , that in the simplest case qcd populates the region where @xmath44 is correlated or anti - correlated with @xmath2 depending on the fraction of energy of the jets carried by charged particles .",
    "the fluctuations in the vectorial sum of charged particles momenta in a jet , and in the amount of transverse momentum carried by those , derives from fluctuations in the parton shower and hadronization non - perturbative process . on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath2 in qcd events appears preminently as a consequence of the fluctuation in the jet energy measurement in the calorimeter , or in the peculiar topology where one or more of the jets in the event falls in an uninstrumented region of the detector .",
    "the reasons for the appearance of the @xmath2 and of the @xmath44 in qcd events are completely uncorrelated .",
    "an angular correlation is on the other hand introduced by the fact that in the simple event topology of qcd dijet events , @xmath2 and @xmath44 have to be aligned with either one jet or the other .",
    "as demonstrated in a previous section , this topology is only mildly altered in the circumstance where qcd events appear with larger jet multiplicities due to radiation .",
    "an important consequence of the peculiar angular correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath44 is that qcd is supposed to populate symmetrically the @xmath73 distribution , with the symmetry centered at @xmath80 . by rejecting the events with @xmath81 and defining as signal region the one with @xmath82",
    ", one can infer the contribution of qcd in the signal region in a data - driven fashion by counting the events populating the rejected region , i.e. @xmath81 . the robustness of this method has been tested by varying the jet multplicity , by placing cuts on the angular correlation among @xmath2 and the jets direction , varying @xmath2 cuts , etc . @xcite . in all instances , by using mc simulation the above assumption has been found true to a level of @xmath83 .",
    "the exact value should be determined by properly defining a  control region \" for the analysis .",
    "following the same reasoning , it is legitimate to assume that qcd events in the @xmath84 could be used to model the kinematic features of qcd events in the complementary region .",
    "the systematic uncertainties associated with the simulation of high multiplicity qcd jet production are very large . for these reasons",
    "a reliable data - driven modeling method for this category of events is of fundamental importance in collider physics analysis .",
    "this has been done in @xcite for dijet signatures and in @xcite with multiplicities up to 10 . in all instances ,",
    "a general good agreement has been found for a large number of the kinematical and topological distributions .",
    "the atlas and cms calorimeter performance are comparable or mildly superior to the one of the cdf detector used in this study .",
    "this means that qcd multijet production is still a serious obstacle to physics measurement and searches in the @xmath85 signature .",
    "on the other hand , the coverage of the atlas and cms charged particle spectrometer is far superior to the cdf one .",
    "both arguments lead the authors to believe that the application of the techniques presented here to these experiments would be straightforward , and bring notable advantages . in particular , the authors call for a revisitation of the current atlas and cms strategies of tightening the @xmath2 requirements to cope with the increasing collider instantaneous luminosity , and suggest and alternative way to control the qcd background .",
    "the authors are aware that cms uses already the spectrometer in a ",
    "particle flow \" reconstruction in order to increase the @xmath2 and jet energy resolution ; still , improving the resolution on those observables reduces the qcd contribution to @xmath85 samples but does not fully eliminate it .",
    "we argue that even after the use of particle flow techniques the @xmath44 and its correlation with @xmath2 will help to suppress qcd and to model its contribution .",
    "it is foreseeable that future upgrades of the atlas and cms trigger systems could allow the computation of a @xmath44  primitive \" online , in order to contain the @xmath2 and @xmath85 trigger rates to reasonable levels , without having to raise @xmath2 cut to the point where the loss of interesting signals become unacceptable .",
    "we introduced here a new observable that can be used to infer informations on the four - momentum of invisible particles passing trough collider detectors .",
    "the paper focuses on collisions where invisible particles appear together with quarks or gluons in the final state , where improvements in the identification techniques of invisible particles is crucial in order to suppress the otherwise dominant qcd background .    as the technique uses only the spectrometer , as opposed to the traditional use of the calorimeter , the instrumental resolutions are completely uncorrelated .",
    "in particular , the resolution on the @xmath44 measurement depends almost solely on the inherent fluctuation on the number and transverse momentum carried by the charged hadrons of the jets in the event .",
    "we have further shown the importance of the evaluation of the angular correlation between @xmath40 and @xmath43 , as a valid tool to reduce the contribution of the qcd multijet background in @xmath2+jets signatures , studying the properties of @xmath44-related observables in collider data and in mc simulations . by taking advantage of the peculiar properties of @xmath44",
    ", we developed a data - driven way to understand the qcd contribution to the @xmath85 sample with relatively large precision , and suggest that in a similar fashion one can reproduce with similar level of detail the kinematic properties of qcd multijet events .",
    "the techniques developed here have been already successfully used in a broad range of analyses at the tevatron experiments@xcite .",
