    "different single site approximations such as coherent potential approximation ( cpa)@xcite , cluster approximations such as cluster cpa with open boundary condition , dynamical cluster approximation ( dca)@xcite and effective medium super - cell approximation ( emsca)@xcite with periodic boundary condition are used to approximate self energy of interacting disordered systems . in the single site approximations",
    "the * k * dependent of self energy is neglected while in the cluster approximations such as dca@xcite for interacting and disordered systems , nlcpa@xcite for disordered systems and emsca@xcite in general for interacting disordered systems the cluster wave vector , * k * , dependent of self energy are considered .",
    "the dca originally constructed in the k - space by dividing the first brillouin zone ( fbz ) in to @xmath1 cells .",
    "the wave vectors at center of these cells are called cluster wave vectors and denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "they claimed these cluster wave vectors , @xmath3 , are corresponds to a real cluster with periodic boundary condition@xcite .",
    "but for some clusters there are many possible sets of cluster wave vectors , @xmath4,@xcite where some of cluster wave vectors are in the higher brillouin zones . recently to consider contributions of such different sets of cluster wave vectors , @xmath4 , the origin of fbz fixed at @xmath5 and a phase @xmath6 added to the cluster orthogonality condition , @xmath7 they claimed , when number of lattice sites @xmath8 the phase , @xmath6 , goes to zero and this relation converts to the following original lattice orthogonality condition , @xmath9 their uncorrected assumptions and results are due to two factors , first their chosen cluster sizes havent original lattice symmetry around cluster central site because this could lead to existence of different set of cluster wave vectors where some of wave vectors are in the higher bzs .",
    "second , the born von karman periodic boundary condition , @xmath10@xcite , imply that maximum number of cluster sites , @xmath1 , should be the whole lattice sites @xmath11 , not @xmath8 .",
    "so in this limit their defined @xmath6 is not going to zero , hence their orthogonality condition eq.[eq : row ] is not converting to the original lattice orthogonality condition eq.[eq : lattice ortho ] . since real lattice sites and allowed wave vectors in the fbz have a one to one correspondence , hence for each cluster with @xmath1 sites , it must exist a unique set of @xmath1 cluster wave vectors @xmath3 in the fbz .",
    "therefore we must add an extra condition to the periodicity of clusters with @xmath1 sites to have whole cluster wave vectors in the fbz and just a unique set of super - cell wave vectors @xmath3 .",
    "although periodicity condition for such real space clusters are considered@xcite but _ symmetry of original lattice around central lattice site of clusters _ are not considered .",
    "this is the weakness point of dca and nlcpa where such symmetry are not considered . by considering both _",
    "periodicity _ and _ lattice symmetry conditions _ for clusters , size of super - cells limit to those clusters that we can define the wigner - seitz cell ( wsc ) for their central sites and if we translate this wsc by cluster sites vectors set , @xmath12 , where defined with respect to the central cluster site , they cover whole cluster with out overlapping .",
    "for a 2 dimensional square lattice ( 2d ) this is illustrated in figure [ figure : super - cell - symmetry ] .",
    "this important condition lead to interesting result where for each cluster there is a unique super - cell wave vectors , @xmath4 , with full fbz symmetry around @xmath5 . here",
    "we reformulate the emsca in the real space to clarify this problem .",
    "we start our investigation by a general tight binding model for a disorder alloy system which is given by , @xmath13 where @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of an electron with spin @xmath16 on lattice site @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the number operator .",
    "@xmath19 are the random hopping integrals between @xmath17 and @xmath20 lattice sites with spin @xmath16 respectively .",
    "@xmath21 is the chemical potential and @xmath22 is the random on - site energy , where takes @xmath23 with probability @xmath24 for the host sites and @xmath25 with probability @xmath26 for impurity sites .",
    "the equation of motion for electrons corresponding to the above hamiltonian , eq.[eq : hamiltonian ] , is given by , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the random single particle green function .",
    "eq.[eq : equation of motion ] could be rewrite as @xmath29 the dyson equation corresponding to eq.[eq : equation of motion ] for the exact averaged green function , @xmath30 , is@xcite , @xmath31 where the real space self energy matrix , @xmath32 , is defined by , @xmath33 by eliminate clean system green function @xmath34 between eqs.[eq : average dyson equation ] and [ eq : self enrgy definition ] , the exact random green function @xmath35 could be expand in terms of exact average green function @xmath36 and exact self energy @xmath32 as , @xmath37 note that although eqs.[eq : random dyson equation ] , [ eq : average dyson equation ] and [ eq : random - average dyson equation ] are exact but no exact solutions for them .",
    "so they should be solved approximately . in the next section by adding _ original lattice symmetry condition _ to the chosen super - cell , we reformulate the effective medium super - cell approximation ( emsca ) . in this new formalism",
    "we show for any super - cell size with _",
    "periodicity _ and _ original lattice symmetry _ conditions not only there is a unique set of super - cell wave vectors @xmath3 but also all super - cell wave vectors occur in the fbz with its symmetry .",
    "in the emsca the real lattice is divided in to the similar super - cells such that each super - cell have whole original lattice symmetry around it s central site .",
    "this means that for each super - cell , if any one sit on it s central lattice site , exactly see whole lattice symmetry@xcite .",
    "figure [ figure : super - cell - symmetry](a ) shows this approximation for a 2 dimension square lattice which is divided in to super - cells with nine sites , @xmath38 , the central site of each super - cell denoted by green color .",
    "figure [ figure : super - cell - symmetry](b ) illustrate one of these super - cells .",
    "each of these super - cells have original lattice symmetry around its own central site .",
    "the set of sites inside each super - cell denoted by @xmath39 .",
    "note that it is possible to divide this lattice in to super - cells with out lattice symmetry , for example in figure [ figure : super - cell - symmetry](c ) and ( d ) this system divided in to square super - cells with four sites , @xmath40 , which super - cell hasnt original lattice symmetry around non of its own sites .",
    "therefore this cluster can not give use a correct results .",
    "since for each lattice vector there is a unique wave vector in the fbz in the k - space , so for the set of super - cell vectors set @xmath12 it must exist a unique set of super - cell wave vectors in the k - space in the fbz . to see lattice symmetry effect on the super - cell wave vectors , we reexamine the super - cell wave vectors corresponding to fig.[figure : super - cell - symmetry ] ( a ) and ( c ) .",
    "fig.[figure : k - super - cell - symmetry ] shows unique super - cell wave vector sets corresponding to nine sites approximation , @xmath41 , of fig.[figure : super - cell - symmetry ] ( a ) .    while for the four sites super - cell which is not preserved lattice symmetry , fig.[figure : super - cell - symmetry ] ( c ) , there are four different super - cell wave vector sets as illustrated in fig.[figure : k - super - cell - asymmetry ] .",
    "the super - cell wave vectors of each set are not preserve fbz symmetry .",
    "hence we found just super - cells with original lattice symmetry around their own central sites preserve a one to one corresponding between real space super - cell vectors and super - cell wave vectors in the k - space .",
    "therefore in the next part of this section we reformulate the emsca for super - cells with lattice symmetry",
    ".    since the super - cells in the real lattice are similar , intra super - cell multiple scattering kept and inter super - cell multiple scattering are neglected , hence the super - cell self energy , @xmath42 , obey periodicity condition of the original lattice super - cells@xcite , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a vector connects central lattice sites of _ m_th and _ n_th super - cells , @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are integer numbers and @xmath48 is number of lattice sites along the _ i_th",
    "primitive vector @xmath49 .",
    "so @xmath50 is length of super - cell along the @xmath49 and for a 3-dimension system , number of sites in a super - cell is @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath52 is an integer number . by applying eqs.[eq : self enrgy periodicity ] and [ eq : super - cell tranlation - vector ] to the following exact self energy relations ,",
    "@xmath53 we have @xmath54 where eq.[eq : q - self enrgy periodicity ] imply that , @xmath55 hence , @xmath56 where _ m _ is an integer number .",
    "eq.[eq : super - cell periodicity condition ] for the nearest neighbour super - cells , @xmath57 , defines a unique set of @xmath58 super - cell wave vectors in the first brillouin zone ( fbz ) which have fbz symmetry around @xmath0 . to avoid confusing them with the lattice wave vectors * k * , they are denoted by @xmath59 , @xmath60 where @xmath61 . from eq.[eq : k - super - cell periodicity condition ] for each super - cell size we can obtain super - cell wave vector set @xmath62 .",
    "it should be emphasize that the super - cell wave vectors set , @xmath62 , around center of fbz have original fbz symmetry due to original lattice symmetry of super - cell . to reexamine this method we consider a limit case , when each super - cell extended to the whole lattice , that is @xmath63 , hence @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "so the translation vector between nearest neighbour super - cells , where each super - cell are included whole lattice sites , are @xmath66 eq.[eq : k - super - cell periodicity condition ] by considering eq.[eq : exact - super - cell tranlation - vector ] converts to the following periodicity condition @xmath67 the super - cell wave vectors set @xmath68 defined by eq.[eq : super - cell born van karman periodicity condition ] are exactly the lattice vectors @xmath69 defined by the following periodicity born von karman condition , @xmath70 hence in this limit @xmath71 and emsca become exact .    in the next part of this section by applying emsca to the exact system we drive relation between real space and k - space super - cell self energies , average green functions and the orthogonality relation .",
    "first we investigate self energies . in the emsca@xcite",
    "just self energy inside of each super - cell sites are non zero , @xmath72 where _ i _ and _ j _ are restricted to the same super - cell .",
    "we apply eq.[eq : super - cell approximation condition ] to the following exact relation to find relation between k - space and real space super - cell self energies , @xmath73 and @xmath42 , @xmath74 since number of super - cells in the whole lattice is @xmath75 and in the super - cell approximation just self energies inside of each super - cell , @xmath42 , are nonzero hence by using eqs.[eq : self enrgy periodicity ] and [ eq : k - super - cell periodicity condition ] , eq.[eq : k - space real - space ] reduces to , @xmath76 by converting eq.[eq : k - space real - space ] to the real space we have @xmath77 where by consider the following super - cell orthogonality condition @xmath78 eq.[eq : k2-space real - space ] reduces to , @xmath79 eqs.[eq : k - space real - space ] , [ eq : super - k - space real - space ] and [ eq : super - cell - real - space ] are a set of equations that can convert real space @xmath73 and k - space super - cell self energies @xmath42 .",
    "although relation between real space exact self energy,@xmath80 , and super - cell self energy , @xmath81 , is known using eq.[eq : super - cell approximation condition ] but in the * k * and * k*-spaces it should clarify . to find relation between exact self energy @xmath82 and super - cell self energy @xmath73 we defining @xmath83 , where @xmath84 restricted to a sub - cell in the fbz symmetry around super - cell vector @xmath85 .",
    "hence in following exact self energy relation , @xmath86 the summation over * k * could be separated in to two parts , @xmath87 , where * k * are wave vectors with respect to @xmath85@xcite hence , @xmath88 this exact self energy , @xmath89 , could be convert to the super - cell self energy , @xmath42 , if we assume @xmath90 and @xmath91 hence we have @xmath92 note that similar to eqs.[eq : ssuper - cell second condition ] and [ eq : dca - self energy ] are introduce in the dca@xcite .",
    "our next task is to find such relations for green functions .    to find relation between average super - cell green function @xmath93 and exact average green function @xmath94 , @xmath95 where @xmath94 is @xmath96 and @xmath97 is bare system green function .",
    "now we write each wave vector @xmath69 in terms of its nearest super - cell wave vector @xmath85 and inside cell wave vector @xmath98 , @xmath69=@xmath85+@xmath98 hence @xmath87 . by using these and eq.[eq : ssuper - cell second condition ] the exact average green function @xmath99 in terms of k - space green function @xmath94",
    "is given by , @xmath100 by using eq.[eq : ssuper - cell second condition ] the exact average green function , @xmath99 , converts to super - cell green function , @xmath101 , @xmath102 where relation between k - space super - cell green function , @xmath93 , and k - space exact average green function , @xmath94 , is given by , @xmath103 similar to this equation derived in the dca formalism@xcite .",
    "so relation between k - space and real space super - cell green functions is given by , @xmath104 to complete our set of equations for calculation self energy and green function , we apply the emsca formalism to the self energy definition equation , eq.[eq : self enrgy definition ] , where we take average over all super - cells except one , called _ impurity super - cell _ , hence the random potentials in all super - cells except _ impurity super - cell _ are replace by super - cell self energies@xcite , @xmath105 figure [ figure : emsca-1d ] illustrate the emsca formalism for a 1d alloy system .",
    "therefore eq.[eq : self enrgy definition ] in the emsca reduces to , @xmath106 by inserting eq.[eq : super - cell self enrgy definition ] in to eq.[eq : random - average dyson equation ] this equation reduces to the following relation for the super - cell impurity green function for any arbitrary lattice sites _",
    "i _ and _ j _ , @xmath107 when _ i _ and _ j _ restrict to impurity super - cell sites , eq.[eq : general super - cell random - green ] reduces to , @xmath108 where @xmath109 although eq.[eq : super - cell random - green ] can be separated in to two equations by definition of _ cavity green function_@xcite but for disorder systems it is not necessary to defined such cavity green function , although we must defined it in general for interacting disorder systems@xcite .",
    "eqs.[eq : exact - super - cell green function ] , [ eq : r - k - super - cell green function ] , [ eq : super - cell self enrgy definition ] , [ eq : super - cell random - green ] and [ eq : average - super - cell random - green ] construct a complete set of equations to be solved self consistently to obtain super - cell self energy , @xmath110 , and average super - cell green function @xmath111 . the algorithm for calculation of average green function @xmath111 in the emsca is as follows    1- a guess for k - space self energies @xmath112 usually zero .",
    "2- calculate the super - cell average k - space green functions , @xmath113 , by inserting @xmath112 in @xmath114 .",
    "3- fourier transform of k - space @xmath115 to obtained real space green function @xmath111 .",

    "6- calculate new self energies @xmath110 by inserting obtained @xmath116 and @xmath111 in eq.[eq : super - cell self enrgy definition ] .",
    "now we apply our method to a 1 dimension ( 1d ) alloy system . since just super - cells with odd number of lattice sites preserve the lattice symmetry with respect to their middle site , we compared calculated average density of states for different super - cell size .",
    "figure[figure : k1 - 3 - 7-emsca-1d ] illustrate average density of states for super - cells @xmath117 . by increasing super - cell size more peaks in the average density of states .",
    "the corrections are due to nonlocal effects where neglected in the single site approximations , @xmath118 .",
    "we have added an extra condition to the cluster approximations such as dynamical cluster approximation ( dca ) , non local coherent potential approximation ( nlcpa ) and effective medium approximation ( emsca ) , where the chosen cluster must have original lattice symmetry with respect to its central site .",
    "this condition leads to a one to one correspondence between super - cell sites and super cell wave vectors in the first brillouin zone hence a unique set of super - cell vectors for each cluster size .",
    "one of this vector is @xmath5 and other super - cell vectors around this vector have full fbz symmetry . while without this condition , for some cluster sizes , some of the cluster wave vectors locating in the higher brillouin zones .",
    "this lead to two effects , first asymmetry of cluster wave vectors with respect to fbz center hence when number of sites in the cluster goes to whole lattice sites the cluster wave vectors are not cover whole fbz .",
    "second , existence of many set of cluster wave vectors . in our formalism",
    "when number of cluster sites goes to number of lattice sites the super - cell vectors recover whole fbz and emsca become exact .",
