    "the discovery of the double pulsar system psr  j07373039 @xcite has led to important advances in the study of radio pulsars and their associated phenomenology .",
    "the independent determination of the orbit of both neutron stars , and the recent measurement of five post - keplerian parameters from the timing of a @xcite and a sixth one from eclipse observations of a @xcite has made this the most over - constrained system known , allowing five tests of general relativity .    psr  j0737@xmath03039b ( henceforth b ) has many unique features .",
    "it emits pulsed radio waves during most of the orbit , but it becomes much brighter at two distinct orbital phases @xcite .",
    "furthermore , its pulse profile changes strongly with orbital phase and with time @xcite .",
    "though instructive in other ways , this behaviour has made it difficult to measure times of arrival accurately and obtain a precise estimate of the semi - major axis of the orbit of b , limiting the precision of our knowledge of the pulsar mass ratio @xmath1 and the precision of some of the tests of general relativity in this system ( see , e.g. , kramer & stairs 2008 for a recent review ) .",
    "this paper is motivated by another unique feature of b : for certain orbital phases its radio emission is clearly modulated by electromagnetic emission from a @xcite ; the phenomenon superficially resembles drifting sub - pulses ( e.g.  lorimer & kramer 2005 ) . in this work",
    ", we discuss the _ timing _ of this phenomenon . in ",
    "[ sec : delays ] , we present a theoretical calculation of the delay in the arrival at the earth of the sub - pulses of b relative to the radio pulses of a responsible for the drift .",
    "we name this simply the `` response delay '' . in   [ sec : comparison ] , we discuss how we can compare the predicted and measured response delays . in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , we highlight the astrophysical knowledge that can be gained from the timing of the response delays .",
    "( 0,5.0 ) ( -3.0,0.0 )      the time between the emission of a s radio pulse and b s response can be divided in three parts , which we discuss below .    1 .",
    "the sub - pulses of b are spaced by 22.7  ms , which is the same as the spin period of a @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can think of the maximum intensity of the sub - pulses of b ( the `` response '' ) as being caused by the impact upon b s radio emitting region of a co - rotating beam of electromagnetic radiation from a. we henceforth refer to this as the em beam . since the em beam is not necessarily aligned in rotational phase with a s radio beam , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rotation ] , we introduce a phase offset @xmath2 between the two beams .",
    "we define a s zero longitude to be the point where the radio emission towards the earth reaches maximum intensity .",
    "as we show later , one of the applications of our model would be the direct determination of @xmath2 .",
    "+ one of the simplifying assumptions in fig .",
    "[ fig : rotation ] is that the spin axis of a is perpendicular to the orbital plane .",
    "this has been suggested @xcite as the most plausible explanation for the lack of change in the pulse profile of a ; ferdman ( 2008 ) set an upper limit of about @xmath3 for the misalignment between the orbital angular momentum and the spin of a. we henceforth assume that the spin axis of a is indeed perpendicular to the orbital plane",
    ". it is not know whether a rotates in the same sense as the orbit or in the opposite sense , but kinematic considerations @xcite make the former more likely .",
    "we discuss this issue further in ",

    "has rotated by an angle @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the longitude of a as seen from the location and time where the em signal modulated the radio pulse of b ( point e at time @xmath9 , see fig .  [",
    "fig : rotation ] ) .",
    "the positive sign corresponds to a clockwise rotation of a as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rotation ] , i.e. , in the same sense of the orbit .",
    "the time between the two events is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the spin period of a. 2 .",
    "after @xmath5 the em pulse of a travels towards b ; at time @xmath12 it gets to b s exact position .",
    "the distance between these two events is @xmath13 , this is calculated in ",
    "[ sec : distance ] . in the assumption above",
    "( that signal travels at the speed of light ) we have @xmath14 3 .",
    "what happens near b is less certain .",
    "the simplest assumption is that the em signal is able to travel through b s magnetosphere at the speed of light ( this is possible e.g. if the em signal consists of high - energy photons ) and modulates b s earth - bound radio emission at the point where it is being generated ; we designate this as `` e '' .",
    "+ we must keep in mind that this simplified assumption is not the only possible case : a ) the modulation could occur after b s radio signal is produced , i.e. , somewhere between point e and the earth and b ) more generally , the chain of events from the emission of the em signal at a ( @xmath15 ) to the modulation of the radio signal of b ( @xmath9 ) might not lie along a single null geodesic . for the time being , we will quantify the simplest case only ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : rotation ] ) .",
    "+ since e is where the earth - bound radio emission is being generated , we assume it is the point of the radio - emitting region of b s magnetosphere that is in the line of sight from b to earth .",
    "this only happens when b s radio pulse is `` on '' . for most of b",
    "s rotational cycle , when its pulse is `` off '' , no part of its radio - emitting region is pointing at earth , and no response is detected .",
    "+ in our simplified model , we assume that the distance of e to b is a constant @xmath16 as a function of b s spin phase . therefore , in the reference frame of the orbital plane ( with axes along the line of nodes , perpendicular to the line of nodes and perpendicular to the orbital plane ) , e is located at fixed coordinates ( 0 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) relative to b , where @xmath19 is the orbital inclination of the system ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rotation ] ) .",
    "+ at @xmath12 , the em wavefront from a reaches b. a small amount of time later , at @xmath9 , the same wavefront reaches e and produces the response . from that figure",
    ", we can see that @xmath20 between @xmath12 and @xmath9 the orbital motion of b will make e move by a small amount relative to the center of the binary , this will affect the arrival time at e. we note , however , that for slow pulsars @xmath21 is expected to be of the order of 1 ms @xcite .",
    "assuming this is true , a detailed calculation of the @xmath22 doppler correction due to b s ( and e s ) motion shows that this term is smaller than @xmath23 . since the r.m.s .",
    "timing precision of a is about @xmath24 , and the timing precision for b s response is likely to be worse , we will ignore all terms with magnitude @xmath25 .    for the total time difference",
    "we obtain : @xmath26 which should be valid in any inertial reference frame using the orbital parameters as measured in that frame .",
    "( 0,6 ) ( -2.4,0.0 )      we now calculate the delay between the reception at the ssb of a s radio pulses and b s responses , @xmath27 . to do this",
    ", we will start by adding to @xmath28 the difference in the ranges at which these events occur , @xmath29 divided by @xmath30 ; this is the so - called `` rmer delay '' .",
    "as in the case of @xmath28 ( eq .  [ eq : time ] ) , @xmath29 can also be described as the sum of three terms , @xmath31 :    1 .",
    "the difference in range between the events at @xmath4 and @xmath5 is given by : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the velocity of a relative to the centre of mass , projected along the line of sight to earth (  [ sec : distance ] ) .",
    "2 .   in the lower diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : travel_time ] , we see that the difference in range between the events happening at @xmath12 and @xmath5 is given by : @xmath34 3 .   ignoring the motion of e between @xmath12 and @xmath9",
    ", we have @xmath35    the delay is therefore given by : @xmath36 where the subscript `` r '' indicates that we are taking into account the rmer delay only .",
    "in this equation we use @xmath37 to represent the spin period of a with the classical doppler correction due to its orbital velocity .",
    "this equation is valid at the ssb if we use the orbital parameters as measured there .    in appendix",
    "a we present a detailed calculation of the relativistic contribution to the total response delay @xmath38 , known as the `` shapiro delay '' ( @xmath39 ) . for the range of orbital phases where we observe b s responses @xmath39 changes @xmath40 , i.e. , smaller than the r.m.s",
    ". timing precision of a. we can therefore assume @xmath41 for the remainder of this paper .",
    "( 0,4 ) ( -2.5,0.0 )      having calculated the response delay as a function of @xmath42 and the separation between the two pulsars , @xmath13 , we now calculate these two quantities as a function of @xmath43 at @xmath5 .",
    "the reason for this is that @xmath43 can be calculated precisely for any given time using the equations in damour & deruelle ( 1985,1986 ) , furthermore , this quantity determines the instantaneous configuration of the system .    in the equations that follow , we will only use the newtonian terms to @xmath44 .",
    "a detailed calculation shows that the @xmath45 newtonian terms are much smaller than the r.m.s .",
    "timing precision of a. this means that they can be ignored for or present purposes .    at @xmath5 , the separation of pulsar i ( a or b ) from the centre of mass is given ( see , e.g. , roy 1988 ) by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the semi - major axis of its orbit , @xmath48 is the orbital eccentricity and the angle @xmath49 is the true anomaly of the system at @xmath5 ( @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the longitude of periastron of pulsar i at @xmath5 ) . the components of a pulsar s velocity along the radial ( i.e. , away from the centre of mass ) and transverse directions are given @xcite by @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the transverse velocity of pulsar i at quadrature ( @xmath54 ) and @xmath55 is the orbital period of the binary .",
    "the velocity of that pulsar relative to earth is given by ( e.g. , green 1985 ) : @xmath56 calculating this velocity for a we can immediately quantify the doppler correction term for @xmath11 in eq .",
    "[ eq : basic ] .    to calculate the instantaneous distance between the pulsars ( @xmath57 )",

    ", b is moving . because the em signal is moving in the radial direction , only the radial component of b s motion ( @xmath60 )",

    "fig : blowup ] we can see that @xmath64 in the derivation above we made the approximation that @xmath42 is the longitude of a as seen from b at @xmath12 . the longitude of a as seen from point e at @xmath9 is larger by a very small amount , @xmath65 .    noting that @xmath66 , @xmath67 with this result we can re - write eq .",

    "so far , we have just made a theoretical calculation of the response delays , @xmath72 .",
    "we now discuss what we can learn from actually measuring such delays .",
    "if we measure @xmath72 for several @xmath43 in a single orbit and subtract @xmath69 , we can measure the delays that are not _ a priori _ predictable : @xmath73 in order to measure @xmath72 , we have to specify a particular radio pulse of a ( in principle the closest to the time of emission of the em signal that caused that particular response ) and subtract its ( barycentric ) time from the response s barycentric time .",
    "however , because we have no prior knowledge of the terms in eq .",
    "[ eq : remains ] , there is some ambiguity in the choice of the pulse that is closest to that time of emission .",
    "an experimental method that does away with the issue of the choice of a pulse of a and even the measurement of @xmath74 entirely would proceed along the following lines :    1 .",
    "b s responses are particularly noticeable in an intensity gray - scale plot of time versus spin phase of b as presented by @xcite . in such a plot",
    ", we can determine the precise spin phase corresponding to each response ; the precise method to accomplish this and the attainable precision will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "2 .   in the next step ,",
    "we convert this phase into a barycentric time .",
    "this can be achieved using the software package tempo .",
    "the result corresponds to an event that occurred at @xmath9 in the reference frame of the binary .",
    "3 .   subtracting @xmath69",
    ", we obtain a second barycentric time that nearly corresponds to a s emission of the em pulse ( @xmath75 in the reference frame of the binary ) . at this time",
    "we calculate @xmath43 from the binary s ephemeris .",
    "4 .   subtract the nearest time at which the rotational phase of a is zero .",
    "this time should be the equivalent of @xmath76 . by fitting this to eq .",
    "[ eq : remains ] we should be able to determine @xmath16 , @xmath2 and the direction of the spin of a.    with data from different orbits , we can also get a sense for the stability of @xmath2 and @xmath16 .",
    "thus far we have assumed that @xmath16 ( the height above b where the response is produced ) is a constant as a function of b s rotational phase .",
    "it is possible , however , that @xmath16 varies with b s spin phase .",
    "this would also introduce a secular variation of the @xmath16 observed for any spin phase of b due to the pulsar s geodetic precession .",
    "if that is the case , we could map the height of e above b as a function of the precession phase .",
    "confusion with @xmath69 can be avoided because , despite the fact that both terms vary with @xmath77 , only the latter varies with @xmath78 .",
    "the response delays @xmath72 will vary in time for any given @xmath43 because of the apsidal motion @xmath79 changes @xmath49 , which causes a change in @xmath69 : @xmath80,\\ ] ] where @xmath9 and @xmath81 are two epochs at which the longitude @xmath43 occurs and @xmath82 other terms of order larger than @xmath83 cancel out in the subtraction because of the constant @xmath42 , and the same happens for the terms dependent on @xmath70 and @xmath16 is not correct , i.e. , it only requires that any terms dependent on @xmath16 vary with @xmath42 in a repeatable way . ] .",
    "the variation of the doppler correction to @xmath11 are @xmath84s and can therefore be ignored .",
    "the @xmath85 are important because , being due solely to a variation of @xmath69 , they are proportional to @xmath86 .",
    "the maximum variation occurs between the time when @xmath43 coincides with periastron ( @xmath87 , occurring at @xmath88 ) and apastron ( @xmath89 , occurring at @xmath90 , which for psr  j0737@xmath03039 is about 10.65 years later ) : @xmath91 in a single 2003 observation , mclaughlin et al .",
    "( 2004 ) observe b s responses from @xmath92 , i.e. , occurring shortly before the magnetosphere of b eclipses a at @xmath93 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath94 . at these extremes we have @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the uncertainty in this prediction is entirely due to the uncertainty of @xmath86 ( which results entirely from the uncertainty in the measurement of @xmath97 ) ; it represents 0.5  1.5% of a rotation of a ; this means that we should be able to keep track of the response delays with very high confidence .",
    "the variations themselves are certainly measurable , since they are equivalent to many rotations of a. this means that we can always make an independent measurement of @xmath86 .",
    "depending on the precision and number of measurements of @xmath72 , the value of @xmath86 derived in this fashion might be more precise than the present value derived from timing . in that case",
    ", we can improve our knowledge of the mass ratio : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the projected semi - major axis of a s orbit , in light seconds ; this quantity is directly and very precisely measured from the timing of a. this equation ( and also eqs .",
    "[ eq : delta_1 ] and [ eq : delta_2 ] ) show that , to determine @xmath100 from @xmath86 and @xmath99 we need to know @xmath101 .",
    "we could in principle determine @xmath101 independently from comparing measurements of @xmath85 made at different orbital longitudes . however , most theories of gravitation predict the shapiro `` s '' term to be the same as @xmath101 @xcite ; therefore such an independent determination is not likely to be a useful test of gravitation .",
    "for this reason , we can use the extremely precise estimate of @xmath101 from @xmath102 in the estimate of @xmath100 .",
    "finally , we remark that there is a small difference between the intrinsic and observed semi - major axes of the pulsar s orbits that is caused by aberration effects .",
    "kramer et al .",
    "( 2006 ) estimate that for a these are of the order of @xmath103 , i.e. , about @xmath23 ; this is similar to the level of precision for the measurement of @xmath99 .",
    "it is highly unlikely that we will measure @xmath86 to a similar precision , so this should not be a problem for the determination of @xmath100 in eq .",
    "[ eq : mass_ratio ] .",
    "for b , kramer et al .",
    "estimate that the effect of aberration should be of the order of @xmath104 .",
    "it might be possible that we measure @xmath105 to better than the necessary level of precision .",
    "however , to be able to measure the aberration directly , we must be able to measure @xmath106 from timing with this level of accuracy , so that the difference between the two values becomes evident .",
    "the intrinsic uncertainty of the @xmath106 obtained from timing is about @xmath107 @xcite , one order of magnitude larger than the effect of aberration . therefore , unless the direct timing of b improves by more than one order of magnitude , the effects of aberration wo nt be separately measurable .",
    "in this paper we have calculated the delay between the radio pulses of a and the modulated radio pulses of b , @xmath72 , assuming a simple scenario for that modulation , i.e. , that it happens at the point , e , where the radio emission of b is being produced and that the modulating signal is traveling from a to e at the speed of light .",
    "things could be more complicated , particularly considering that this trajectory must intersect the magnetosphere of b.    we will present details of the measurements of @xmath72 and their timing analysis elsewhere . if the response delays obey the equations presented above in a consistent manner , that will validate our model . in that case , the measurement of these delays relative to the radio pulses of a can provide us with new astrophysical information .",
    "first , a determination of the sense of a s rotation relative to its orbit , something never achieved for any other pulsar , would introduce fundamental constraints on binary evolution scenarios for this pulsar , as well as improved constraints on b s supernova kick .",
    "finding that the orbital angular momentum is anti - aligned with a s angular momentum would require a very large supernova kick @xcite .",
    "previous studies ( e.g. , willems et al .",
    "2006 , stairs et al . 2006 )",
    "predict instead that the kick that produced b was rather small , therefore the angular momenta should be aligned .",
    "a confirmation of this alignment , combined with the small angle between the momenta , would introduce stringent constraints on the magnitude of the kick .",
    "furthermore , we would know the sign of the expected relativistic spin - orbit contribution to @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "it is probable that this contribution will be measured in the near future @xcite ; that would allow an estimate of a s moment of inertia .",
    "the moment of inertia of a , together with the well - determined mass of the pulsar , will introduce fundamental constraints on the equation of state for dense matter @xcite .",
    "second , by measuring @xmath16 , or by introducing upper limits to it , we might be able to locate the region where the em signal from a is modulating the radio signal from b and relate it to the region where we expect the radio emission of b is being generated .",
    "thus far , the best location of pulsar radio emission comes from the interpretation of multi - frequency polarimetric pulse profiles in light of a relativistic version of the the familiar rotating vector model @xcite ; the results indicate an emission height of a few hundred km .",
    "if the signal is being modulated as its being generated , then @xmath16 should be of the order of a few ms and therefore a measurable quantity .",
    "if @xmath16 is significantly larger , then the modulation is happening after b s radio signal is generated .",
    "third , we will make an independent measurement of the orbital separation of the two pulsars , @xmath86 .",
    "if the timing of b s responses is precise enough , this might give us a more precise measurement of the mass ratio of a and b , which would increase the precision of some of the previous tests of general relativity carried out in this binary system .",
    "this is a key input parameter for the general tests on conservative gravity theories outlined in kramer  &  wex  ( 2009 ) .    in the ideal case that we can track the response times well",
    ", one might think of their reception at the earth as being equivalent to having a radio telescope at an altitude @xmath16 above b tracking a s rotation and then relaying the results live to earth .",
    "this analogy highlights how fortunate we are to have a phenomenon like b s responses .",

    "<S> we show that measuring these delays is equivalent to tracking a s rotation from the point of view of an hypothetical observer located near b. this has three main astrophysical applications : ( a ) to determine the sense of rotation of a relative to its orbital plane ; ( b ) to estimate where in b s magnetosphere the radio sub - pulses are modulated and ( c ) to provide an independent estimate of the mass ratio of a and b. the latter might improve existing tests of gravitational theories using this system .    </S>",
