    "propagation models on lattices or more general graphs describe the spreading of some discrete signal through a set of discrete entities . in the most general terms",
    ", the signal corresponds to some qualitative change that causes the entity to interact differently with its neighbors .",
    "examples include the spreading of damage in power grids @xcite , the spreading of disease through a population @xcite , the spreading of a computer virus on the internet @xcite , or the alteration of gene expression patterns in a cell due to a mutation @xcite . in the general case ,",
    "the individual entities are represented as nodes in a graph where the links indicate paths along which the signal can spread @xcite . because the signal can be thought of as disrupting the static or dynamical state of the original system , we refer to its propagation as spreading _ damage _ , though in many cases the `` damage '' may enhance a desired property or simply represent some natural dynamical process . a single instance of a given spreading process initiated from a particular subset of nodes is often called an avalanche .    in analyzing spreading processes ,",
    "one is often interested in the transition between those that die out quickly and those that spread to a finite fraction of the system in the large - system limit , a transition that may occur as the probability of transmitting damage across links is varied .",
    "this percolation transition is relevant for systems in which the fraction of initially damaged nodes tends to zero in the limit of infinite system size .",
    "the order parameter for the transition is the average fraction of nodes damaged in a single avalanche , which remains zero for small transmission probabilities and continuously increases when the probability rises above a threshold value .",
    "we will refer to this as the _ sparse percolation _ ( sp ) transition .",
    "the sp  transition occurs for spreading processes in which the probability that a node becomes damaged is zero unless at least one of its neighbors is damaged .",
    "( if this probability were nonzero , a nonzero fraction of the nodes would always get damaged . )    for a certain class of propagation models , there is another transition of interest .",
    "when the fraction of initially affected nodes remains fixed as the system size is increased , the fraction of nodes that remain _ undamaged _ can undergo a transition from finite values to zero at transmission probabilities above some threshold .",
    "we refer to this as the _ exhaustive percolation _ ( ep ) transition .",
    "the ep   transition occurs only for propagation models in which the probability of a node remaining undamaged is zero when all of its neighbors are damaged ( all of its inputs in the case of a directed graph ) .",
    "we assume also that there is a nonzero probability for a node to remain undamaged if it has at least one undamaged input .",
    "there is then one more condition for the ep  transition : the density of directed loops of any specified size must vanish in the large system limit . for any loop",
    "there is a finite probability that no member of the loop will be damaged , since no member of the loop can have all of its inputs damaged until one of the members becomes damaged through a probabilistic event .",
    "thus ep  is _ not _ observable on spatial lattices of the type generally encountered in statistical mechanics .",
    "ep  is observable , however , on directed lattices and on graphs in which the nodes serving as inputs to a given node are selected at random .    in this paper",
    "we derive the probability distribution for the number of undamaged nodes at the ep  transition on random graphs for a general class of propagation models exhibiting what we call _ unordered binary avalanches _ ( uba ) .",
    "this is analogous to finding the distribution of avalanche sizes at the usual percolation transition , but here we are asking for the distribution of the number of nodes _ not _ participating in the avalanche .    as an application of our ep  results , we consider the problem of identifying unfrozen nodes in a random boolean network ( rbn ) . in a rbn",
    ", each node has a binary state that is updated according to a rule that takes the values of some other nodes as inputs .",
    "the dynamics of rbns has been investigated extensively ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "a rbn  can have several dynamical attractors , but some nodes might have the same value at all times on all attractors .",
    "such nodes are called _ stable _ and the set of stable nodes is important for the dynamics in rbns @xcite .",
    "almost all stable nodes in a broad class of rbns can be identified through a dynamic process that was introduced by flyvbjerg @xcite and formalized to facilitate numeric simulations by bilke and sjunnesson @xcite .",
    "we call the stable nodes that can be identified by this dynamic process _ frozen _ ( and nodes that are not frozen are called _ unfrozen _ ) . provided that the boolean rule distribution is symmetric with respect to inversion of any subset of inputs , the set of frozen nodes can be identified through an uba  in which frozen inputs cause new nodes to become frozen ( damaged ) .",
    "most rule distributions that have been examined in the literature exhibit this symmetry .",
    "the requirement is satisfied , for example , for any model that assigns given probability @xmath0 for obtaining a 1 in each entry of the truth table for each node .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first develop the notation and basic definitions required for discussing ubas in general . in section  [ sec : basic defs ] , we give an introduction to the uba   formalism from the perspective of percolation processes .",
    "a more formal description is given in section  [ sec : introduction to ep ] , followed by a numerical illustration of the basic concepts . in section  [ sec : random networks ] , we present analytic derivations for uba  in random networks with emphasis on ep  and the ep   transition .",
    "we also present explicit results for the special case of erds  rnyi networks with a natural choice for the avalanche rules .    in section  [ sec :",
    "application ] we show how to apply the uba   formalism to obtain the statistics of frozen nodes in two - input rbns . in the present context",
    ", this serves as an illustration of the general theory , but this particular example was also the primary motivation for studying ep .",
    "the results on rbns are consistent with those found by kaufman , mihaljev , and drossel .",
    "the main advantage of using the ep  formalism for this problem is that it makes clear how the calculation can be extended to networks with more than two inputs per node , including networks with an in - degree distribution that ( with a low probability ) allows arbitrarily large in - degrees .",
    "an unordered binary avalanche ( uba ) is defined as a spreading process with the following properties :    binary states : : :    the state of each node can be characterized as a binary variable    @xmath1 , with @xmath2 meaning _ undamaged _ and    @xmath3 meaning _ damaged _ ; boolean rules : : :    the state of each node is determined by a boolean function of the    states of its input nodes ; order independence : : :    the probability of having a given set of nodes damaged at the end of    the process does not depend upon the order in which nodes are chosen    for updating .",
    "order independence refers to the dynamics of the spreading process or a simulation of it . in such a simulation ,",
    "one typically chooses a site and updates it according to a rule depending on the states of sites that provide inputs to it , repeating the process until a test of every site yields no change in the state of the system .",
    "we are interested in cases where the order in which sites are chosen for possible updating has no bearing on the final state of the system .",
    "uba  is a natural extension of site or bond percolation . to determine the avalanche size distribution in site percolation ,",
    "for example , one identifies an initial subset of damaged sites and then tests neighbors of damaged sites to see whether the damage spreads to them . after a given site",
    "is tested for the first time , its value is permanently fixed .",
    "the process is iterated until no new damaged sites are generated .",
    "see , e.g. , ref .  @xcite .",
    "this method of investigating site percolation is equivalent to assigning all sites a value , then beginning with a damaged site and determining all of the damaged sites in a connected cluster .",
    "site percolation where each site has the probability @xmath0 to be occupied can be recast as a ubasystem as follows .",
    "let each site be associated with a rule that is an or - rule of all of its neighbors with probability @xmath0 and is a constant 0 with probability @xmath4 .",
    "then the above described site percolation is achieved by first selecting the rules and clamping the value of a given site to 1 , and then repeatedly updating the system according to the boolean rules . in this situation , the 1s in the final state mark a site percolation cluster .",
    "a more practical way of simulating the same uba  is to determine probabilistically the boolean rule at each site only when that site is first encountered in the percolation process and to update only those nodes where the rules have been determined .    to ensure order independence in uba",
    ", it is sufficient to require that each boolean function is non - decreasing , meaning that if one of the inputs to the rule changes from 0 to 1 , the output is not allowed to change from 1 to 0 .",
    "for non - decreasing boolean functions , if a specific node is eventually going to be assigned the value 1 during an avalanche , updating other nodes to 1 first can not change the outcome .",
    "we are particularly interested in ubas that are initiated by damage at a set of nodes comprising a nonzero fraction of the total number of nodes .",
    "such a process would be relevant , for example , if the probability that any given node is damaged at the start is independent of the system size .    to clarify both the distinction between ep  ( exhaustive percolation ) and sp  ( sparse percolation ) and the similarities between them , we describe a particular case of a propagation model that exhibits both transitions . consider a graph with a total of @xmath5 nodes , some of which have three input links each while the others have no input links at all .",
    "the graph is random in that the node supplying the input value on any given link is selected at random , but stays fixed throughout the avalanche .",
    "let @xmath6 be the fraction of nodes with no inputs .",
    "define a spreading process as follows :",
    "the initial condition is that all nodes with no inputs are considered damaged .",
    "each other node is now selected in turn to see whether the damage spreads to it . if a node has one damaged input , the probability that it will be damaged is @xmath7 ; if it has two damaged inputs , the probability of damage is @xmath8 ( with @xmath9 ) ; and nodes with three damaged inputs are guaranteed to become damaged ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "these probabilities are realized , for example , by the following boolean rule distribution : a 3-input or - rule with probability @xmath7 ; a 3-input majority rule with probability @xmath11 ; and a 3-input and - rule with probability @xmath12 .",
    "as @xmath5 goes to infinity , the number of initially damaged nodes can be a nonzero number that grows slower than @xmath5 , meaning that @xmath6 goes to zero as @xmath5 goes to infinity . in this limit",
    ", the sp  transition occurs at @xmath13 and the spreading from each initially damaged node is described by a _",
    "watson process_. in a galton  watson process , a tree is created by adding branches to existing nodes , with the number of branches emerging from each node drawn from a fixed probability distribution .",
    "such branching processes have been investigated extensively .",
    "( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite . ) in particular , the correspondence to galton ",
    "watson processes means that for critical sp , the probability of finding @xmath14 damaged nodes scales like @xmath15 for @xmath16 @xcite .    for any nonzero value of @xmath6",
    ", the ep  transition occurs for @xmath8 satisfying @xmath17 ( assuming that this value of @xmath8 is greater than @xmath7 . )",
    "the analysis described in section  [ sec : random networks ] provides a method of calculating the probability @xmath18 of having @xmath19 _ undamaged _ nodes in this case .",
    "the result in the large @xmath5 limit is @xmath20 for large @xmath19 .",
    "a difference between ep  and sp  is that both @xmath21 and the cutoff on the @xmath22 distribution scale with @xmath5 for ep , while for sp  only the cutoff scales with @xmath5 .",
    "we now describe a formalism and establish some notation that is suitable for a detailed treatment of uba .",
    "let @xmath5 denote the number of nodes in a network with a specified set of links and let the nodes be indexed by @xmath23 .",
    "the network state is described by the vector @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath25 denote the number of inputs to node @xmath26 , and let @xmath27 denote the vector of @xmath25 inputs to node @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath28 denote a boolean function and let @xmath29 denote the initial probability that node @xmath26 has the rule @xmath28 .",
    "[ it is required that @xmath28 has precisely @xmath25 inputs for @xmath29 to be nonzero . ]    to efficiently simulate uba , we keep track of the information that is known about each node at each step in the process . in particular , it is important to keep track of whether or not the change from 0 to 1 of a given input has already been accounted for in determining the output . the simplest way to do",
    "this is to introduce an extra state 0 *  that labels a site whose rule @xmath28 implies an output value of 1 but for which the update to 1 has not yet been implemented .",
    "when a node changes its state from 0 to 0 * , it is a silent change in the sense that the boolean rules at the other nodes treat an input 0 *  exactly the same as 0 . to retrieve the final state of the network ,",
    "all occurrences of 0 *  must be updated to 1 .",
    "when a single update to 1 is made , the information that the given node has value 1 is passed along to all nodes with inputs from it .",
    "the values of these nodes may then change from 0 to 0*. the conditional probability that the value of node @xmath30 is updated from 0 to 0 *  when @xmath26 changes value from 0 *  to 1 , is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the value of @xmath33 after @xmath34 has been updated and @xmath35 is the probability that @xmath36 : @xmath37 the numerator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ui ] ) is the probability that @xmath38 produces a 1 after the update of node @xmath26 minus the probability that @xmath38 produced a 1 before the update .",
    "the denominator is the probability that node @xmath30 had the value 0 before the update .",
    "let @xmath39 denote the probability that the rule at node @xmath30 has output 1 regardless of its input values .",

    "steps [ j select][j : = 1 ] are iterated as long as there exists a node in state 0*. [ iterate ]    uba  can also be considered on infinite networks , but that requires a more technical description of the process .",
    "first , the choices of @xmath26 in step 3 for both descriptions must be such that any given @xmath26 that satisfies the conditions in step  [ j select ] will be selected in a finite number of iterations .",
    "second , the ensemble of final states needs to be defined in terms of a suitable limit process because the stopping criterion in step  [ iterate ] can not be applied to an infinite system .",
    "note that the dynamics is only dependent on the probability functions @xmath50 .",
    "that is , the precise rule distributions affect the avalanche results only through their contributions to @xmath51 . because the boolean rules are non - decreasing functions , @xmath35 is also a non - decreasing function . in fact , every non - decreasing function , @xmath52 , with values in the interval @xmath53 $ ] can be realized by @xmath35 for a suitable boolean rule distribution .",

    "figure  [ fig : lattice uba ] displays an avalanche that is initiated by letting each node be initially damaged with probability @xmath63 .",
    "a node assigned or becomes damaged if either of its neighbors one layer above is damaged ; a node assigned and becomes damaged if and only if both neighbors above it are damaged .",
    "this means that @xmath64 note that clusters of damaged nodes formed in an avalanche initiated by a single damaged node can not contain any holes , as the uppermost undamaged node in the hole would have to have two damaged inputs and hence would become damaged when updated .    for localized initial damage ,",

    "[ fig : lattice uba ] , as a function of the selection probability @xmath0 for or - rules and the probability @xmath63 for initial damage .",

    "the statistical uncertainty in the estimated mean is less than the line width . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : lattice ep ] shows the average number of unaffected nodes as a function of @xmath66 for @xmath63 on lattices with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the numerics displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice ep ] clearly suggest that there is a second - order ep  phase transition . furthermore , these numerical results suggest that the avalanche in fig .  [",
    "fig : lattice uba ] is within the parameter regime for ep  and that ep  does not occur in this case due to finite size effects .",
    "for the case @xmath75 , it is possible to map the ep  transition onto ordinary , directed , site percolation on the same lattice . when all nodes in the lattice have and - rules , the following algorithm may be used to determine whether a given node will be damaged : select a node ; put a mark on the selected node unless it is initially damaged ; and recursively mark each initially undamaged node that has an output to a marked node . the selected node will get damaged if and only if this recursion ends in a finite number of steps .",
    "the algorithm describes ordinary directed site percolation where the initially undamaged ( damaged ) nodes are considered active ( inactive ) sites and the process propagates in the opposite direction relative to the uba .",
    "we therefore expect the ep  transition to occur for a value of @xmath67 equal to @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the threshold for directed site percolation @xcite and we have confirmed this with numerical tests .",
    "further study of ep  on the lattice is beyond the scope of this paper .      in the lattice example above , the fact that the network had no feedback loops smaller than the lattice size was important . in general , ep  is suppressed by the presence of short feedback loops . as already noted , for ep  to occur , it is required that the output of each rule in the rule distribution is 1 if all of its inputs have the value 1 .",
    "otherwise , there would be a finite fraction of nodes that keep the value 0 regardless of the influence from the rest of the network .",
    "generalization of this reasoning allows us to rule out epin other situations , indicating that ep  is most likely to occur in directed or highly disordered networks . to pursue this idea ,",
    "we introduce the notion of _ resistant motifs_.    a _ motif _ is a small network with a particular arrangement of internal links .",
    "a given motif may occur many times in a network with different rules assigned to its nodes and with different configurations of external inputs .",
    "a motif is _ resistant _ with respect to a given ensemble of rule assignments if the probability of damage entering the motif when all external inputs are damaged is strictly less than unity . for the rule distributions that we consider for the ep  transition in random networks , each node has a nonzero probability of being assigned a rule that sets its output to 0 if at least one of its inputs is 0 .",
    "thus when all of the nodes in a feedback loop of any length have the value 0 , there is a nonzero probability that they will all remain 0 even if all external inputs to the loop are set to 1 .",
    "every feedback loop of a given length is therefore a resistant motif .",
    "if the number of occurrences of a resistant motif grows linearly with the network size , there will in total be a finite fraction of nodes that remain unaffected with a finite probability .",
    "for such networks , ep  can not occur in the limit of large systems .",
    "examples include typically studied regular lattices and small world networks with link directions assigned so that short feedback loops are prevalent .    the problem resistant motifs can be avoided in random networks having a mean indegree @xmath78 that is well - defined and independent of @xmath5 , in which case the number of feedback loops of a given length approaches a constant .",
    "though the total number of resistant motifs may grow with system size , the larger motifs have a low probability of avoiding damage . for large @xmath5 ,",
    "the out - degree distribution is a poisson distribution with a mean value of @xmath79 .",
    "the outputs emerging from a given node form a tree with approximately @xmath80 nodes at the @xmath81th level .",
    "thus , the probability for a given node to be part of a cycle of @xmath81 nodes is approximately @xmath82 , which means that the typical number of feedback loops of length @xmath81 is approximately @xmath83 . on the other hand ,",
    "the loop may contain either initially damaged nodes or some rules that allow damage to enter from external inputs .",
    "the probability that this will _ not _ occur decays exponentially with @xmath81 .",
    "if the decay is faster than @xmath84 , the density of nodes in undamaged resistant motifs will approach zero .    in summary ,",
    "ep  ( for the considered type of rule distributions ) is excluded on lattices with a high density of feedback loops . for random networks , however , the fraction of nodes in undamaged resistant motifs can go to zero in the large @xmath5 limit .",
    "this property allows ep  to occur on random networks as demonstrated in the following section .",
    "consider a network such that the inputs to each node are chosen randomly and uniformly from all nodes in the network and the probability functions @xmath50 are determined from a given distribution of boolean rules .",
    "for such networks , uba  can be handled analytically .",

    "<S> we consider propagation models that describe the spreading of an attribute , called `` damage '' , through the nodes of a random network . in some systems , the average fraction of nodes that remain undamaged vanishes in the large system limit , a phenomenon we refer to as _ exhaustive percolation_. we derive scaling law exponents and exact results for the distribution of the number of undamaged nodes , valid for a broad class of random networks at the exhaustive percolation transition and in the exhaustive percolation regime . </S>",
    "<S> this class includes processes that determine the set of frozen nodes in random boolean networks with indegree distributions that decay sufficiently rapidly with the number of inputs . </S>",
    "<S> connections between our calculational methods and previous studies of percolation beginning from a single initial node are also pointed out . </S>",
    "<S> central to our approach is the observation that key aspects of damage spreading on a random network are fully characterized by a single function specifying the probability that a given node will be damaged as a function of the fraction of damaged nodes . </S>",
