    "we study the interaction of atoms with two - color light . specifically",
    ", we consider an optical laser with moderate intensity and x  rays . in experiments",
    "this light would be obtained , for instance , from an amplified ti : sapphire laser system with up to  @xmath6w/@xmath7 at a wavelength of  @xmath8 .",
    "the x  rays would be produced by a third - generation synchrotron radiation source like argonne s advanced photon source  @xcite .",
    "there are several ways for the chronology between the two light pulses .",
    "first , there is a pump - probe setting where the laser pulse precedes the x  rays .",
    "especially the combination of a weak laser as a pump and the x  rays as a probe has received a lot of attention , e.g. , ref .  .",
    "for higher laser intensities , ionization of atoms takes place , producing aligned , unoccupied atomic orbitals .",
    "they are probed by using xuv  light or x  rays to excite an inner - shell electron into them  @xcite .",
    "second , there is a pump - probe setting where the laser pulse succeeds the x  rays .",
    "this situation has not received much of a focus ( see , however , ref .  ) .",
    "third , there is a simultaneous exposition of atoms and molecules to two colors .",
    "recently , we studied molecules exposed to a laser with an intensity close to but still below the excitation and ionization threshold .",
    "if the molecule has an anisotropic polarizability tensor , they may be aligned along the linear laser polarization axis  @xcite ; the x  rays serve as an _ in situ _ probe of the rotational molecular dynamics . going a bit higher in laser intensity , without exciting and ionizing ,",
    "is possible for rare gas atoms . in krypton ,",
    "laser dressing caused a pronounced deformation of the photoabsorption cross section around the @xmath2  edge  @xcite .",
    "in neon we even found a strong suppression of the x - ray absorption on the ne@xmath9  resonance  @xcite .",
    "the name electromagnetically induced transparency  ( eit )  @xcite for x  rays was coined to describe the strong reduction of absorption in neon .",
    "it is related to eit for optical wavelengths  @xcite by being essentially given by the same @xmath10-type three - level model .",
    "the only difference in the case of eit for x  rays is the linewidth of the second unoccupied level which is not approximately zero . due to high laser intensity , transparency over",
    "a large number of wavelengths arises .",
    "the difference between the x - ray absorption spectra for laser - dressed neon and krypton is predominantly due to the ten times higher decay width of the @xmath2  vacancies in krypton ( @xmath11  @xcite ) compared with neon ( @xmath12  @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath2  vacancies are produced by x - ray absorption and decay by x - ray fluorescence and auger decay  @xcite .",
    "another difference between eit for optical wavelengths and eit for x  rays lies in the fact that refraction and dispersion by matter in the x - ray regime is generally tiny .",
    "eit enables ultrafast control of the absorption and dispersion of a gaseous medium on a femtosecond time scale because the coupling laser , typically a ti : sapphire laser system , can be combined with the sophisticated pulse shaping technologies available for optical wavelengths  @xcite .",
    "these pulse shapes can be imprinted on x  rays leading to ultrafast pulse shaping technology for x  rays  @xcite .",
    "the ability to create almost arbitrarily shaped x - ray pulses opens up perspectives for the control of the dynamics of the inner - shell electrons in atoms .",
    "this way of shaping x - ray pulses is similar to our recent study of x - ray absorption by laser - aligned molecules where x - ray pulses are shaped by controlling the molecular alignment  @xcite . as the rotational dynamics of molecules takes place on a picosecond time scale , the x - ray pulse shaping is , however , done on a much slower time scale .",
    "electron bunch manipulation techniques for short x - ray pulse generation are presently developed at synchrotron radiation facilities  @xcite .",
    "our approach complements these efforts in a very cost - effective way .    in this work",
    ", we would like to supplement our previous investigations with a detailed account of the refraction and the dispersion of x  rays by laser - dressed atoms .",
    "our theory is applied to argon .",
    "also we demonstrate that there is appreciable eit for x  rays for argon .",
    "as there is no substantial eit effect for krypton , this means that eit for hard x  rays is predicted for the first time ( the @xmath2  electrons of argon can be ionized with x  rays of a wavelength of  @xmath13",
    "such wavelengths are already useful to resolve coarse molecular structures via x - ray diffraction in molecular imaging ; our work offers a way of temporal control of the x - ray pulses in such experiments .",
