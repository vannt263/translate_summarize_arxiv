    "if we take traceless hermitian matrices like pauli , gell - mann one sees that they may be divided in two subsets @xmath3 and @xmath4 such that @xmath5 \\subseteq h , [ b , b ] \\subseteq h , [ b , h ] \\subseteq b$ ] . the @xmath3 direction in algebra correspond to isotropy subgroup of some state vector , i.e. unitary transformations that leave this state vector intact .",

    "each given @xmath7 one could build @xmath8 traceless  basis \" matrices that may be divided in two sub - sets @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "one should remember , however , that the cartan decomposition of interaction hamiltonians treated as  a physical resource \" @xcite has the physical sense only in respect with initially chosen state vector .",
    "therefore the parametrization of these decomposition is state - dependent @xmath9 \\subseteq h_{\\psi } , [ b_{\\psi},b_{\\psi } ] \\subseteq h_{\\psi } , [ b_{\\psi},h_{\\psi } ] \\subseteq b_{\\psi}$ ] @xcite .",
    "it means that physically it is interesting not abstract unitary group relations but realization of the unitary group transformations resulting in motion of the pure quantum states represented by rays in projective hilbert space .",
    "the hamiltonian control problem was initially formulated by m.a .",
    "nielsen @xcite .",
    "recently it it was reformulated to the  quantum control problem \" @xcite as synthesis of given n - qubit unitary @xmath10 by the application of some time dependent hamiltonian @xmath11 during time @xmath12 so that the total cost @xmath13 is minimized with so - called cost function @xmath14 .",
    "this cost function was chosen with help  cartan control problem \" .",
    "i however propose to simplify this problem even more so that in this framework  the physical interpretation of n - qubit cartan control problem for @xmath15 is not as transparent \" @xcite .",
    "hereafter i will use for simplicity the symbol @xmath16 assuming @xmath7 where it is necessary .    taking into account that only quantum states have physical sense i propose to estimate",

    "the first `` squeezing '' unitary matrix is @xmath26 this transformation being applied to our @xmath25 with the following result @xmath27 now one should solve two `` equations of annihilation '' of @xmath28 and @xmath29 in order to eliminate the the last row .",
    "this gives us @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the next step is the similar transformation given by the unitary matrix with the diagonally shifted up the transformation block @xmath32 and the similar calculation of @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "generally one should make @xmath21 steps in order to annulate @xmath21 elements of the @xmath25 .",
    "it is easy to see that each step of the  squeezing \" is action of the unitary gate from @xmath35 acting on a qubit intentionally chosen in some complex direction .",
    "therefore one of the possible set of gates transformation of arbitrary state vector to first vector of the  standard \" basis is established .",
    "it is clear that these transformations of the isotropy group of @xmath36 are not optimal since they act at the first @xmath37 steps as  zigzag \" motions for alignment of @xmath38 and @xmath25 along the geodesic in @xmath17 .",

    "it is possible to connect two normalized state vectors by one unitary coset transformation generating motion along @xmath17 geodesic .",
    "* it is enough to prove this statement for two states , say , now for @xmath36 and @xmath40 .",

    "if we assume for simplicity that incoming state is @xmath36 then all its isotropy group transformations arose from its @xmath50-subalgebra will leave it intact .",

    "the algorithm proposed above concerns the control by time - independent but final - state - dependent hamiltonian @xmath51 , since ( [ 10 ] ) with @xmath65 should be used for manipulation of the register state .",
    "it is applicable to any initial and target states @xmath25 and @xmath40 .",
    "the example is , say , quantum fourier transform @xmath66 , connected initial state @xmath67 and @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "similar examples give us the actions of such unitary gates as hadamar , phase shift and controlled - u gate whose final state may be connected by @xmath70 geodesic with an initial state .    the method of control given above",
    "is applicable in the semi - classical regime when the reaction of quantum state on the external field and inertial properties of quantum state are negligible .",
    "but when uniliteral interaction is non - realistic and stiff control is not acceptable , arises more complicated problem of the dynamical control with self - consistent interaction .",
    "dynamical quantum control is nothing but self - interaction in combined system  quantum state + control field \" .",
    "let me return now to the  quantum control problem \" @xcite as synthesis of given n - qubit unitary @xmath20 by the application of some time dependent hamiltonian @xmath71 during time @xmath12 ,    @xmath72    the synthesis of unitary matrix @xmath20 in formulation of @xcite from time dependent hamiltonian @xmath71 during time @xmath12 is very complicated since has not generally exact solution and requires exponential time to achieve acceptable accuracy .",
    "i propose to solve more ",
    "flexible \" problem : to find not only time - dependent but state - dependent hamiltonian vector field on @xmath17 .",
    "it correspond to the problem of affine gauge field formulated in @xcite .",
    "interaction of any  filter \" @xmath73 with incoming quantum state @xmath74 depends only on their relative  orientation \" .",
    "it is clearly explained on the example of incoming polarization state of photon and the orientation of the @xmath75 plate in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , only relative phases and amplitudes of photons have a physical sense for their interaction with @xmath75 plate .",
    "one may assume that it is correct and in general case of quantum interaction .",
    "it means that the filter action depends only upon the local coordinates ( [ 6 ] ) in the complex projective hilbert space @xmath17 .",
    "the transition to the local coordinates is in fact non - linear * dynamical mapping * onto @xmath17 . * small relative re - orientation of the filter and incoming state leads to small variation of outgoing state .",
    "* this is a key point of all construction invoking to life the concept of the local dynamical variables ( ldv ) expressed by tangent vectors fields to @xmath17 .",
    "it is convenient to rely upon  orientation \" of the filter given by the set of @xmath76 unitary group field parameters @xmath77 somehow related to space - time coordinates ( i would like to note , that it is not so trivial problem as thought before ) .",
    "then , since any state @xmath74 has the isotropy group @xmath78 , only the coset transformations @xmath79=cp(n-1)$ ] effectively act in @xmath80 .",
    "therefore the ray representation of @xmath81 in @xmath80 , in particular , the embedding of @xmath50 and @xmath82 in @xmath83 , is a state - dependent parametrization .",
    "technically the local @xmath81 unitary classification of the quantum motions requires the transition from the matrices of pauli @xmath84 , gell - mann @xmath85 , and in general @xmath86 matrices @xmath87 of @xmath6 to the tangent vector fields to @xmath17 in local coordinates @xcite .",
    "hence , there is a diffeomorphism between the space of the rays marked by the local coordinates ( [ 6 ] ) in the map @xmath88 and the group manifold of the coset transformations @xmath89=cp(n-1)$ ] and the isotropy group of the corresponding ray .",
    "this diffeomorphism is provided by the coefficient functions @xmath90_m^i",

    "this maps the unitary group @xmath81 onto the base manifold @xmath17 .",
    "now one may introduce hamiltonian vector field as a tangent vector fields @xmath92 whose control functions @xmath93 may be found under the condition of self - conservation expressed as affine parallel transport of hamiltonian vector field @xmath94 agrees with fubini - study metric @xmath95 the problem of finding  control functions \" @xmath93 treated in the context of gauge field application as surrounding fields of quantum lump was discussed in @xcite .",
    "this approach requires future investigation and development in respect with signals propagation in quantum circuits too .",
    "it is shown that two arbitrary normalizable vectors in @xmath80 may be connected by series of unitary transformation in polynomial time @xmath96 with acceptable  cost \" @xmath57 .",
