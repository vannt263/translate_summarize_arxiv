    "the taylor - couette system @xcite of fluid flow in the annulus between concentric cylinders with the inner and the outer one rotating with different velocities is one of the simplest examples of a driven nonlinear dissipative system that shows spontaneous pattern formation out of an unstructured basic state that is stable at small driving @xcite .",
    "this basic flow state is stationary and axially and azimuthally homogeneous and shows only a radial variation across the annular gap .",
    "it consists of a superposition of circular couette flow ( ccf ) in azimuthal direction and of an annular poiseuille flow ( apf ) in axial direction if as in our case an axial through - flow is imposed .",
    "axially periodic vortex flow solutions bifurcate @xcite out of this homogeneous basic flow when the rotation rate of the inner cylinder is sufficiently high .",

    "the parameter ranges of rotation rates and through - flow investigated here in this work three spatiotemporally differing primary vortex structures are relevant : rotationally symmetric , toroidally closed vortices with azimuthal wave number @xmath2 that move in downstream direction with the apf  for shortness we call this flow state taylor vortex flow ( tvf ) although the presence of an axial through - flow modifies the genuine stationary tvf stucture . and , furthermore , spiral vortex flow ( spi ) consisting of either left spiral vortices ( l - spi ) with @xmath8 or right spiral vortices ( r - spi ) with @xmath9 .",
    "l - spi and r - spi are axial mirror images of each other in the absence of axial through - flow with the latter breaking the mirror symmetry of the former . while rotating azimuthally into the same direction as the inner cylinder l - spi propagate axially opposite to r - spi .",
    "this spiral dynamics is largely induced by the advective properties of the basic flow state .",
    "furthermore , without through - flow the symmetry degenerate bifurcation treshold for these two symmetry degenerate spi solutions is simultaneously also the bifurcation threshold for a vortex flow solution called ribbons @xcite .",
    "this solution consists right at threshold of a linear superposition of l - spi and r - spi with equal amplitude and it becomes further away from threshold a genuine nonlinear vortex flow solution .",
    "however , here we are dealing only with linear vortex flow fields that may be superimposed with arbitrary amplitudes as well as wave numbers and that are evolving separately from each other according to the linear field equations .",

    "we use also the relative control parameters @xmath22 measuring the relative distance of the inner reynolds number @xmath23 from the critical onset @xmath24 of axially extended spiral vortices or taylor vortices in the presence and in the absence @xmath25 of through - flow , respectively @xcite . in this notation @xmath26",

    "the relation between @xmath27 and @xmath28 is @xmath29 with infinitely long cylinders the only relevant parameter characterizing the geometry is the radius ratio @xmath30 .",
    "the velocity field @xmath31 of the fluid is described by the navier - stokes equations ( nse ) for incompressible fluid flow @xmath32 here and in the following we scale positions by the gap width @xmath33 , the velocity @xmath34 by the velocity @xmath35 of the inner cylinder , time @xmath36 by the momentum diffusion time @xmath37 across the gap , and the pressure @xmath38 by @xmath39 with @xmath40 denoting the constant mass density of the fluid .",
    "furthermore we decompose the velocity field @xmath41 into radial ( @xmath42 ) , azimuthal ( @xmath43 ) , and axial ( @xmath44 ) components using cylindrical coordinates @xmath45 .",

    "@xmath51 and @xmath52 with @xmath53      let @xmath54 abbreviate the deviation fields from the basic flow state ( [ u_0 ] ) .",
    "then the general solution of the nse linearized in the deviation fields can be written as a superposition of modes of the form @xmath55 with axial wave number @xmath56 and integer azimuthal wave number @xmath4 .",
    "the complex amplitude functions @xmath57\\ ] ] depend on the mode indices @xmath58 and the radial coordinate @xmath59 .",
    "the characteristic exponent @xmath60 is in general complex .",
    "it is decomposed here as follows @xmath61 into the growth rate @xmath62 and the characteristic frequency @xmath63 of the @xmath64 mode . substituting the above solution ansatz into the linearized nse yields @xmath65 the solution of this eigenvalue problem yields the characteristic exponent @xmath66 and the associated eigenfunctions @xmath67 as functions of @xmath58 . here",
    "@xmath68 are quantities defining the basic flow state ( [ u_0 ] ) .",
    "the latter enters via the linearized advective term of the nse .    in order to rewrite ( [ linear1 ] - [ linear4 ] ) into a system of first - order differential equations  which is advantageous for numerical reasons",
    "we introduce three additional complex amplitude functions @xcite @xmath69 using ( [ defx ] ) and the continuity equation ( [ linear4 ] ) one can then eliminate the pressure in eq.([linear2 ] ) by @xmath70 all in all one obtains in this way a system of 6 coupled , first - order differential equations @xmath71 for the six variables @xmath72 with @xmath73 where @xmath74      we have solved the eigenvalue equations ( [ resultew ] ) numerically with a standard shooting method subject to the six boundary conditions , @xmath75 which make the eigenvalue spectrum discrete . to integrate from @xmath13 to @xmath14 we used a fourth - order runge - kutta formula @xcite with two step widths ( @xmath76 and 1/400 , respectively ) for a richardson extrapolation . a newton - raphson method @xcite",
    "was then used to find the roots of the complex determinant of the @xmath77 matrix which ensures the vanishing of @xmath78 at the outer cylinder .",
    "we therefore vary in the newton - raphson procedure only two of the parameters ( @xmath79 ) @xcite that enter into ( [ resultew ] ) while keeping the others fixed . in this way we determine on the one hand the marginal threshold values of @xmath47 and @xmath63 with @xmath80 for which the basic state is marginally stable against the growth of an extended perturbation with given @xmath4 and real axial wave number @xmath12 at specified parameters @xmath81 . on the other hand we calculate for",
    "given @xmath82 the complex eigenvalue @xmath66 over the _",
    "complex _ wave number plane  including as special case also the real @xmath12-axis . in each case",
    "we are interested only in the vortex modes with the largest growth rates for which the associated amplitude functions @xmath67 display the least radial variation with the fewest number of nodes .",
    "we present here results for the radius ratio @xmath0 in a range of outer reynolds numbers @xmath83 . in this parameter regime",
    "the vortex perturbations with the largest growth rates have in the absence of through - flow azimuthal wave numbers of either @xmath2 or @xmath10 .",
    "we investigate here linear properties of such vortices with @xmath2 and @xmath10 in a through - flow of reynolds numbers @xmath84 .",
    "here we discuss the spatiotemporal structure , symmetry properties , and bifurcation thresholds for onset of axially extended vortex perturbations with real axial wave number @xmath12 and different azimuthal wave numbers @xmath4 in the absence and presence of an axial through - flow .",
    "structure and dynamics of the vortex modes ( [ ansatz ] ) are dominated by the fact that their phases are constant on any cylindrical surface , @xmath85 , along lines given by the equation @xmath86 here the constant phase coming from the amplitude @xmath67 is suppressed .",
    "thus , on the @xmath87 plane of such an unrolled cylindrical surface these lines of constant phase are straight .      for rotationally symmetric taylor vortex like perturbations",
    "the line pattern of constant phases , @xmath88 , is parallel to @xmath89 .",
    "the @xmath4=0 pattern is stationary for @xmath90 . only for finite through - flow it propagates axially with phase velocity @xmath91 that is proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "the main reason for this is that the azimuthal flow of the basic ccf state is precisely parallel to the vortex lines of constant phase while the apf flow being perpendicular to them can advect them .",
    "the latter happens in our axially periodic system that does not exert any phase pinning at the axial boundaries as soon as @xmath92 .",
    "the vortex modes ( [ ansatz ] ) with axial wave number @xmath93 have spiral structure . when @xmath94 is positive ( negative ) the lines of constant phase @xmath95 ( [ z_phase ] ) wind in a left spiral l - spi ( right spiral r - spi ) around the cylindrical surface @xmath85 with negative ( positive ) slope @xmath96 .",
    "the lines of constant phase and with it the whole spiral stucture rotates in @xmath97 rigidly with angular velocity @xmath98 in the absence of an externally imposed through - flow , @xmath1=0 , this rotation proceeds for l - spi and r - spi alike into the same direction as the rotation of the inner cylinder .",
    "the reason is that the spiral perturbations are advected by the inner part of the azimuthal ccf which is relevant for the centrifugal instability leading to vortex generation . a model explaining this effect is presented in @xcite .",
    "there are two immediate consequences of this advective origin of the spiral dynamics induced by the inner cylinder s rotation : ( _ i _ ) with the latter being by definition positive  in this work the inner cylinder is taken to rotate in positive @xmath97-direction  also @xmath99 is positive for @xmath1=0 .",
    "hence , say , an @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) spiral has positive ( negative ) frequency for @xmath1=0 .",
    "then a l - spi ( r - spi ) being defined by @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) propagates for @xmath1=0 upwards ( downwards ) with positive ( negative ) axial phase velocity @xmath102 that is directly related to its _ positive _ angular velocity @xmath103 .",
    "an externally applied axial through - flow changes the axial phase velocities and frequencies of the @xmath2 and @xmath93 vortex modes roughly proportional to @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath104 simultaneously the rotation rates , @xmath105 , of the spirals are changed accordingly .",
    "thus , in each case the vortex frequencies are largely determined by the basic state s advective properties , i.e. , by the combination of azimuthal advection by @xmath106 and axial advection by @xmath107 .",
    "here we consider symmetry properties of axially extended vortex perturbations of the form ( [ ansatz ] ) with real wave number @xmath12 .",
    "symmetry relations between different vortex fronts with complex wave number @xmath108 are discussed later on in sec .",
    "[ sec.front-symm ] .",
    "table [ tab.mod-symm ] shows the symmetry transformations that leave the eigenvalue problem unchanged .",
    "they reflect ( _ i _ ) that @xmath109 transforms under complex conjugation ( indicated by an overline ) as @xmath110 and ( _ ii _ ) that the nse ( [ navier2 ] ) are invariant under an axial reflection @xmath111 .",
    "thus one infers , for example , that the growth rate ( frequency ) of the characteristic exponent @xmath112 for @xmath113 vortices is an even ( odd ) function of @xmath12 and @xmath1 . for perturbations with",
    "@xmath114 one finds that @xmath115 and that the spatiotemporal structure including the amplitude functions of a l - spiral perturbation ( @xmath116 ) at @xmath92 is the same as that of a r - spiral ( @xmath117 ) at @xmath118 .",
    "note , however , that any finite through - flow breaks the axial mirror symmetry between l- and r - spirals at @xmath90 so that , among others , @xmath119 when @xmath120 . but the symmetry relations are such that it suffices to investigate , say , positive @xmath12 combined together with either ( _ i _ ) @xmath121 only for positive _ and _ negative @xmath1 or , equivalently , ( _ ii _ ) @xmath4 positive _ and _ negative for @xmath122 only in order to get the complete linear information on both spiral vortex types .",
    "figure  [ fig.r1c_r2 ] shows the _ critical _ bifurcation thresholds @xmath123 for @xmath2 and @xmath10 vortex patterns with the respective _ critical _ wave numbers , @xmath124 , as functions of @xmath125 in the absence of through - flow .",
    "the vertical lines in fig .",
    "[ fig.r1c_r2 ] mark the two outer reynolds numbers @xmath126 and @xmath127 for which we show in fig .",
    "[ fig.r1c_re ] as representative examples how the critical thresholds evolve with through - flow reynolds number @xmath1 .",
    "the above discussed symmetry relation @xmath128 between the growth rates of r- and l - spirals implies the corresponding relation between the respective bifurcation thresholds ( full and dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig.r1c_re ] ) . in the remainder of this paper",
    "we therefore restrict ourselves without loss of information to positive @xmath1 .    for small @xmath122 the axial flow",
    "stabilizes the basic state against growth of tvf ( @xmath2 ) and r - spi ( @xmath9 ) perturbations . on the other hand , the bifurcation threshold for l - spi ( @xmath8 ) vortex patterns that propagate into the same direction as the through - flow decreases at small @xmath1 and increases only at larger @xmath1 .",
    "the upwards shift of the @xmath2 threshold with increasing @xmath1 is stronger than the one for @xmath8 .",
    "thus , eventually the latter comes to lie below the former and consequently the growth of l - spirals propagating into the same direction as the through - flow is favored for sufficiently large @xmath1 even when @xmath129 .",

[ sec.symm-eigenvalue ] from those for l - spi by @xmath138 , i.e. , by changing the sign of the odd coefficients in table  [ tab.fitpara2 ] .",
    "so far we have considered axially extended vortex perturbations of the form @xmath139 which are single eigenmodes of the operator @xmath109  ( [ result.operator ] ) . for supercritical control parameters , @xmath140 ,",
    "a finite band of axial wave numbers can grow and with it also axially localized wave packets consisting of superpositions of vortex modes .",
    "let us consider first an infinitesimal initial perturbation with azimuthal wave number @xmath4 that is axially localized , i.e. , a wave packet that consists of a superposition of vortex modes of different @xmath12 but common @xmath4  an initial perturbation containing different @xmath4-modes would be just a sum of the above described vortex packets that would evolve independently of each other as long as the linear description is valid .    after fast transients have decayed a pulse like perturbation survives with axial wave numbers within the unstable band centered around the wave number of maximal growth @xmath141 .",
    "since the above described wave packet contains vortex modes that can grow the pulse will grow as well .",
    "simultaneously the pulse center travels axially for small @xmath28 with the critical goup velocity @xmath142 hence when at a bifurcation threshold the frequency is nonzero with a finite group velocity then the supercritical spatiotemporal growth behavior of an axially _ localized _ vortex perturbation differs significantly from an axially _ extended _ vortex mode .",
    "the growth of the latter is axially uniform which is not the case for the former .",
    "furthermore , one has to distinguish between two different supercritical regimes for the former : ( _ i _ ) in the so - called convectively unstable parameter regime of the basic state the vortex packet moves with the velocity @xmath143 faster away than it grows  while growing in the frame comoving with @xmath143 the pulse moves out of the system so that the basic state is restored . in other words , the two fronts that join the pulse intensity envelope to the structureless state propagate both in the direction in which the packet center moves . _",
    "( ii ) _ in the so called absolutely unstable parameter regime the growth rate of the packet is so large that one front propagates in the laboratory frame opposite to the center motion .",
    "thus , the packet expands not only into the direction of the pulse motion but also opposite to it so that eventually the initial perturbation can fill the entire system .",
    "but the linear growth analysis of the vortex fields does not determine in what nonlinear final stable state the system will end nor what possible intermediate nonlinear transient behavior might occur .",
    "however , this analysis has an important implication for experiments with through - flow : developed vortex structures can be seen in finite systems with vortex suppressing inlet conditions only in the absolutely unstable regime which is typically realized at larger @xmath144 ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig.epsilon ] ) if one leaves aside noise - sustained patterns @xcite in the convectively unstable regime . in this latter regime",
    "the vortex front that connects to the zero amplitude inlet condition moves downstream ( we assume that the fronts of our forwards bifurcating vortex structures are linearly selected thus excluding the buildup of nonlinear fronts that might revert their propagation direction ) . in the absolutely unstable regime , on the other hand ,",
    "an upstream motion of this front is stopped by the inlet condition at a characteristic downstream growth length from the inlet .",
    "this growth length of the downstream evolving vortex structure diverges @xcite when approaching the boundary between convective and absolute instability from the latter regime .",
    "it is remarkable that based on the experimental observations of takeuchi and jankowski @xcite such a behavior was discussed already in 1979 [ cf .",
    "figures 4 and 5(a ) and their discussion in sec .",
    "6 of ref .",
    "@xcite ] , albeit without invoking the concept of absolute and convective instability which was introduced to a broader fluid dynamics community only a few years later @xcite .",
    "the boundary between convective and absolute instability of the basic flow against growth of vortices with a particular azimuthal wave number @xmath4 is marked by those parameter combinations for which one of the fronts of the linear packet of @xmath4-vortices reverts its propagation direction in the laboratory frame : in the convectively unstable parameter regime this front propagates in the same direction as the center of the packet , in the absolutely unstable regime it moves opposite to it , and right on the boundary between the two regimes the front is stationary in the laboratory frame .",
    "this parameter combination can be determined by a saddle point analysis of the linear complex dispersion relation @xmath145 over the plane of complex wave numbers @xcite @xmath146 here we do not display the dependence of @xmath147 on the parameters @xmath148 and we also do not indicate that the dispersion relations for vortex perturbations with different azimuthal wave numbers @xmath4 are different .",
    "the boundary condition of no growth for a front that is stationary in the laboratory system is @xmath149 at the appropriate saddle position , @xmath150 , of @xmath145 in the complex wave number plane @xcite .",

    "here and in the following the subscript @xmath154 identifies boundaries between convective and absolute instability .",
