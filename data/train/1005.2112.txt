    "coherent excitation energy transfer is an important step of photosynthesis  @xcite , in which photosynthetic pigments capture the solar light to create electronic excitations and then transfer the excitation energy to a reaction center  @xcite .",
    "usually , the transfer of a single excitation from the pigment where the electronic excitation is created to the reaction center is a very complicated physical process , since the practical transfer process takes place on a complicated network of pigments .",
    "however , the basic physical mechanism can be revealed in such a light - harvesting complex by studying a basic part : a dimer system which consists of a donor and an acceptor modeled by two two - level systems .    on a complicated network of pigments , there generally exist two kinds of interactions . on one hand , between any two pigments",
    "there exists a dipole - dipole interaction , which results in excitation energy transfer . on the other hand , the pigments",
    "interact inevitably with their surrounding environments such as the nuclear degrees of freedom and the proteins .",
    "corresponding to different cases for the scale of the two kind of interactions , different approaches have been proposed to study the single - excitation energy transfer . concretely ,",
    "when the dipole - dipole interactions between any two pigments are much weaker than the interactions of the pigments with their environments , the energy transfer process can be well characterized by the frster theory  @xcite , in which the evolution of the network is calculated perturbatively up to the second order in the dipole - dipole interactions between the pigments ; when the interactions of the pigments with their environments are much weaker than the dipole - dipole interactions between any two pigments , various approaches based on the quantum master equation have been proposed ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , in which the evolution of the network is calculated perturbatively up to the second order in the interactions between the pigments and their environments .    with the above considerations , in this article we study single - excitation energy transfer in a dimer , which consists of a donor and an acceptor modeled by two two - level systems . obviously",
    ", when the donor and the acceptor are decoupled , it is impossible to realize energy transfer between them .",
    "therefore , the simplest way to realize energy transfer is to turn on a non - trivial interaction ( for example , the dipole - dipole interaction ) between the donor and the acceptor .",
    "then a single excitation can coherently oscillate between the donor and the acceptor .",
    "however , in this case , there is no steady - state energy transfer , namely the transferred energy can not approach to a stationary value . in the presence of environments ,",
    "the donor and the acceptor will inevitably couple with environments .",
    "in general , the coupling form between the donor ( acceptor ) and its environment is diagonal in the representation of the free hamiltonian of the donor ( acceptor ) .",
    "physically , due to this type of coupling , although the excitation energy will not decay into the environments , it will induce a steady - state energy transfer between the donor and the acceptor . since in practical cases",
    "both the characteristic frequency and the heat bath temperatures of the donor and the acceptor may be different due to different chemical structures , we study in detail how the characteristic frequencies and the heat bath temperatures of the donor and acceptor affect the efficiency of the excitation energy transfer .",
    "this is one point of the motivations of our present work .    in the presence of the interactions between the pigments for transferring energy ,",
    "a naturally arising question is how about the quantum entanglement among the pigments which are involved in the energy transfer process . because quantum entanglement is at the heart of the foundation of quantum mechanics  @xcite and quantum information science  ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , it is interesting to know how is the dynamics of the created quantum entanglement in the dimer system during the process of single - excitation energy transfer .",
    "this is the other point of the motivations of our present investigations .",
    "in fact , recently people have become aware of quantum entanglement in some chemical and biologic systems ( e.g. , refs .",
