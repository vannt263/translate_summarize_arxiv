    "the douglas  rachford iterative scheme , originally introduced in @xcite to solve nonlinear heat flow problems , aims to find a point @xmath3 in the intersection of two closed constraint sets @xmath0 in @xmath1 or in hilbert space . using monotone operator theory",
    ", lions and mercier @xcite showed that the scheme converges weakly for two closed convex sets @xmath0 in hilbert space with non - empty intersection .",
    "a rather comprehensive analysis of the convex case is given in @xcite .",
    "due to its success in applications , the douglas  rachford scheme is frequently used in the nonconvex setting despite the lack of a satisfactory convergence theory . recently hesse and luke @xcite made progress by proving local convergence of the scheme for @xmath4 an affine subspace intersecting the set @xmath5 transversally , where @xmath5 is no longer convex , but satisfies a regularity hypothesis called superregularity .",
    "numerical experiments in the nonconvex case indicate , however , that the douglas  rachford scheme should converge in much more general situations .",

    "here we prove local convergence of the douglas  rachford scheme when @xmath0 are finite unions of convex sets .",
    "our result is complementary to @xcite , because no transversality hypothesis is required .",

    "we show that this may even lead to continuous limiting cycles .",
    "these are more delicate to construct , because in that case the douglas  rachford sequence @xmath6 is bounded and satisfies @xmath7 , but fails to converge .",
    "our construction is given in section [ failure ] .",
    "given a closed subset @xmath5 of @xmath1 , the projection onto @xmath5 is the set - valued mapping @xmath8 defined as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the euclidean norm , and dist@xmath11 .",
    "the reflection of @xmath12 in @xmath5 is then the set - valued operator @xmath13 given two closed sets @xmath0 in @xmath1 , the douglas  rachford iterative scheme , starting at @xmath14 , generates a sequence @xmath15 by the recursion @xmath16 we call @xmath17 the douglas  rachford operator , or shortly , dr operator .",
