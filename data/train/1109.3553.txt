    "in a recent issue of _ the american mathematical monthly _ , k.  hrbacek _ et al _ have argued that analysis needs better axiomatics than zermelo - fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice ( zfc ) , see @xcite .",
    "they propose a new axiomatic framework that naturally includes numbers they call _ ultrasmall _",
    "( i.e. , infinitesimal ) .",
    "they mention @xcite that these ideas are not entirely new , and provide a list of references the earliest of which is e. nelson s 1977 text @xcite , where the author outlined his enrichment of zfc known as internal set theory ( ist ) .",
    "while the axiomatic approach has much to recommend itself , we feel that a prerequisite for new axiomatics is a good understanding of the mathematical structure that stands to be axiomatized , and not vice versa . to make a convincing case in favor of a new axiom system ,",
    "one first needs to explain the basics . in the case of infinitesimal - enriched continua , the basics amount to understanding the ultrapower construction .",
    "one of our goals in this text is to give an accessible explanation of the latter in the context of cauchy sequences , as well as providing possible alternatives .",
    "cantor s completion of the rationals resulting in the field of real numbers proceeds by quotienting the space @xmath2 of all cauchy sequences of rational numbers by cauchy s equivalence relation .",
    "similarly , the collection @xmath3 of all cauchy sequences of real numbers projects to the archimedean continuum @xmath4 : @xmath5 the corresponding equivalence relation @xmath6 defined by @xmath7 `` collapses '' all null sequences to a single point @xmath8 .",
    "is there another way to define an equivalence relation @xmath9 on the space  @xmath10 that would allow some null sequences to retain their distinct identity ?",
    "in other words , can one _ refine _ cantor s equivalence relation among cauchy sequences , in such a way as not to `` collapse '' all null sequences to zero ?",
    "the idea would be that , relative to a new equivalence relation @xmath9 , a null sequence of reals would become an actual infinitesimal .",
    "in other words , we are searching for a new notion of `` completion '' , with respect to which the real field  @xmath4 can be completed by the addition of infinitesimals . what one seeks is an intermediate stage , @xmath11 , in the projection  .",
    "the subscript `` f '' in the symbol @xmath12 stands for `` finite '' ( i.e. , there are no infinite numbers ) .",
    "such an intermediate stage @xmath12 would represent an infinitesimal - enriched continuum as in figure  [ helpful ] .",

    "this function represents the _ standard part _ of @xmath14_{\\sim}\\in{{}^*{{\\mathbb r}}_\\text{f}}$ ] , that is a standard real number infinitely close to the new number @xmath14_{\\sim}\\in{{}^*{{\\mathbb r}}_\\text{f}}$ ] .",
    "the most natural way to obtain a ring structure on @xmath12 is to define the equivalence relation @xmath9 so that it preserves pointwise sums and products .",
    "therefore , we expect @xmath12 to be a ring rather than a field , because it can not contain the pointwise inverse @xmath19 of an infinitesimal @xmath20 $ ] , since the inverse is not a cauchy sequence .    in this text , we will explore two possible implementations of these ideas .",
    "to implement the ideas outlined in section  [ one ] , a possible approach is to declare two cauchy sequences @xmath15 , @xmath21 to be equivalent if they coincide on a `` dominant '' set of indices in @xmath22 : @xmath23 for simplicity , we will use the symbol @xmath14 $ ] for the equivalence class @xmath14_{\\sim}$ ] generated by @xmath24 .",
    "what is `` dominant '' ?",
    "a finite set in @xmath22 is never dominant ; every cofinite set ( i.e. , set with finite complement ) is necessarily dominant , and we also expect the property that the superset of a dominant set is dominant , as well . moreover , we expect the relation to yield an equivalence relation .",
    "in particular , the validity of the transitive property for generic cauchy sequences implies that the intersection of two dominant sets is dominant .",
    "in fact , let us assume that @xmath25 then , if sets @xmath26 and @xmath27 of indices are dominant , it suffices to take we have @xmath28 . ] @xmath29 to obtain @xmath30 and @xmath31 , so that @xmath32 from  .",
    "it follows that the set @xmath33 is dominant .",
    "conversely , if our family of dominant sets is closed with respect to finite intersections , then the relation @xmath9 is an equivalence relation .",
    "for example , the family of all cofinite sets @xmath34 the so - called frchet filter , satisfies all the conditions we have imposed so far on dominant sets .",
    "these conditions define the notion of a _ filter _ on the set @xmath22 ( extending the frchet filter ) .",
    "it is easy to prove that the equivalence relation @xmath9 preserves pointwise operations",
    "@xmath35+[v]:= \\left[\\left(u_{n}+v_{n}\\right)_{n\\in{{\\mathbb n}}}\\right]\\quad \\text{and } \\quad [ u]\\cdot[v]:=\\left[\\left(u_{n}\\cdot v_{n}\\right)_{n\\in{{\\mathbb n}}}\\right ] \\label{eq : pointwiseringopearations}\\ ] ] so that the quotient @xmath36 becomes a ring .",
    "moreover , the real numbers @xmath4 are embedded in @xmath12 as constant sequences .",
    "whether or not @xmath12 is an integral domain depends on the choice of the filter of dominant sets .",
    "thus , the product of sequences @xmath15 and  @xmath37 given by @xmath38 is zero , but whether or not @xmath14 $ ] is zero depends on whether the set of even numbers is considered to be dominant or not .",
    "we will solve this problem later .    to show that the relation as in is a refinement of the usual cauchy relation  @xmath39 , assume that @xmath15 , @xmath21 coincide on a dominant set  @xmath26 .",
    "then we have  @xmath40 for some subsequence @xmath41 ( enumerating the members of the set @xmath26 ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath42 since @xmath15 and @xmath43 converge .",
    "of course , the relation @xmath9 is a strict refinement because if we take @xmath44 and @xmath45 , then @xmath42 but @xmath46 is the empty set , which is never dominant .    whether the idea expressed by the notion of a dominant set as in   can be considered `` natural '' or not is a matter of opinion .",
    "an alternative approach would be to define a new equivalence relation in terms of the rate of convergence of the difference @xmath47 .",
    "a thread going in this direction will be presented in section  [ sub : nilpinf ] , but here we will continue with the approach based on .",
    "if one accepts this idea , then it is also natural to define an _ order _ , by setting @xmath35\\ge[v]\\quad\\iff\\quad\\left\\ { n\\in{{\\mathbb n}}\\,|\\ , u_{n}\\ge v_{n}\\right\\ } \\text { is dominant}.\\label{eq : order}\\ ] ] this yields an ordered ring , as one can easily check .",
    "is this order total ?",
    "the assumption that it is total , i.e. @xmath48\\ge0\\quad\\text{or}\\quad[u]\\le0,\\label{eq : totalorder}\\ ] ] yields a further condition on dominant sets .",
    "in fact , if @xmath26 is dominant , then defining @xmath49 we have that @xmath26 is dominant if the first alternative of holds ; otherwise @xmath50 is dominant . a filter satisfying this additional condition",
    "is called a _",
    "free ultrafilter_. is an ultrafilter on the set @xmath51 if @xmath52 ; @xmath53 is closed with respect to finite intersections and supersets ; and @xmath54 or @xmath55 for every subset @xmath56 of @xmath51 . ] using this additional condition , we are now also able to prove that @xmath12 is an integral domain .",
    "@xmath12 is an integral domain .",
    "given nonzero classes @xmath14\\not=0 $ ] and @xmath57\\not=0 $ ] , both of the sets @xmath58 and @xmath59 are dominant .",
    "therefore so is their intersection .    given an integral domain , we can consider the corresponding field of fractions @xmath60 .",
    "since @xmath12 is also an ordered ring , the order structure extends to the quotient field of fractions in the usual way .    in a classical approach to nonstandard analysis",
    ", the equality on a dominant set ( formula ) is applied to _ arbitrary _",
    "sequences , rather than merely cauchy sequences .",
    "nonetheless , our field of fractions @xmath60 is isomorphic to the full hyperreal field using the same ultrafilter ; in general , the result will depend on the ultrafilter . ]",

    "note that every sequence @xmath64 can be written as @xmath65 for two null sequences @xmath15 , @xmath43 .",
    "thus , we can set  @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "our intuition yearns for meaningful examples of free ultrafilters .",
    "such can be obtained by using zorn s lemma .",
    "it is possible to prove that some weaker form of the axiom of choice is necessary to prove the existence of a free ultrafilter .",
    "the use of this axiom in modern mathematics is routine .",
    "thus , one of its standard consequences is the hahn - banach theorem , of fundamental importance in functional analysis . yet",
    ", one consequence of exploiting this axiom is that we do nt possess detailed information about how free ultrafilters are made .",
    "moreover , this also implies that it is not so easy to prove the existence of a free ultrafilter satisfying some given and potentially useful conditions .",
    "the frchet filter can be extended to a free ultrafilter .",
    "see tarski @xcite ( 1930 ) .",
    "we have to admit that it is not so easy to judge the idea represented by formula  .",
    "indeed , starting from our definition of pointwise operations and order , one can easily guess that this idea is formally very powerful .",
    "for example , it is almost trivial to extend to @xmath12 the validity of general laws about real numbers , such as the following law : @xmath68 in fact , we can extend trigonometric functions pointwise .",
    "namely , we extend @xmath69 to @xmath70 by setting @xmath71\\right):=\\left[\\left(\\sin(u_{n})\\right)_{n\\in{{\\mathbb n}}}\\right].\\ ] ] finally , the law extends to @xmath72 and @xmath73 because the set of indices @xmath74 where it is true is all of @xmath22 .",
    "we will deal with this extension of laws from @xmath4 to @xmath12 in more general terms in section  [ sec : leibnizs - law ] .",
    "on the other hand , whatever will be the example of ultrafilter we will be able to present , it does nt seems sufficiently meaningful why the infinitesimal @xmath75 $ ] should be considered positive rather than negative , or vice versa . or odd numbers will be dominant ( but not both ) . let us suppose , e.g. , the first case and continue : even numbers in @xmath76 , i.e. the set @xmath77 of multiples of 4 , or its complement @xmath78 will be dominant",
    ". in the latter case , also @xmath79 , i.e. numbers of the form @xmath80 , will be dominant . in any case we would be able to find always a dominant set which has `` 1/2 of the elements of the previous dominant set '' .",
    "continuing in this way , we can obtain a dominant set , which is intuitively very `` thin '' with respect to its complement .",
    "to understand this idea a little better , let us consider that everything we said up to now can be generalized if instead of sequences @xmath81 we take functions @xmath82\\rightarrow{{\\mathbb r}}$ ] . in other words , instead of taking our indices as integer numbers , we take real numbers in @xmath83.$ ] then , we can repeat the previous reasoning considering , at each step @xmath84 , subintervals of length @xmath85 . therefore , for every @xmath86 , we are always able to find in an ultrafilter on @xmath83 $ ] a dominant set @xmath26 whose uniform probability @xmath87 , whereas @xmath88\\setminus a)>1-\\epsilon$ ] , even though this complement is not dominant .",
    "see @xcite for a formalization of this idea using the notion of density of subsets of @xmath22 . ]",
    "to summarize , the idea of requiring sequences to coincide on dominant sets , even if it may seem initially forbidding from an intuitive point of view , appears to be formally extremely powerful . as an alternative , in section  [ sec : nilpotentinf ]",
    "we will present another idea , which is intuitively clear but which does nt seem equally powerful . which thread one wishes to follow would depend on applications envisioned .",
    "what are , formally , the infinitesimals in the ring @xmath12 of  , and how are they related to null sequences ? an infinitesimal is a number in @xmath12 which belongs to every interval of the form @xmath89 $ ] :    we say that @xmath90 is _ infinitesimal _ if and only if @xmath91 and we will write @xmath92 . similarly , we write @xmath93 if @xmath94 .",
    "clearly , such an @xmath90 will be infinitesimal if and only if in the field of fractions @xmath60 , the element  @xmath95 is infinite , may contain additional more infinitesimals not found in  @xmath12 ; see remark  [ rem : p - poininnsa ] below . ]",
    "i.e. it does nt satisfy a bound of the form @xmath96 for some @xmath74 .",
    "do infinitesimals in @xmath12 correspond to ordinary null sequences ?",

    "this allows us to define the standard part mentioned above .",

    "that we have  @xmath108 for every @xmath90 .",
    "is our extension @xmath12 of @xmath4 still cauchy complete with respect to some kind of metric extending the usual euclidean metric on @xmath4 ?",
    "it is not hard to prove that @xmath109 defines a pseudo - metric having the desired properties .",
    "note that @xmath12 is not dedekind complete , since the set of all the infinitesimals is bounded but does not admit a least upper bound .",
    "[ rem : p - poininnsa ] in the quotient field @xmath60 , the assertion of theorem [ thm : infinitesimalsandnullsequences ] is not generally true , unless one considers a particular type of ultrafilter , called a p - point .",
    "while the existence of a free ultrafilter can be proved using zorn s lemma , which is equivalent to the axiom of choice , the existence of a p - point can not be proved in zfc , that is using the usual axioms of set theory plus the axiom of choice . assuming the continuum hypothesis or martin s axiom and using transfinite induction , it is possible to prove the existence of a p - point .",
    "see @xcite and references therein for more details about this foundational wrinkle . can be easily extended to @xmath60 if we consider fractions @xmath110}{[v]}$ ] for which the limit @xmath111 exists finite .",
    "it results that @xmath110}{[v]}$ ] is infinitesimal in @xmath60 if and only the limit of this fraction is zero .",
    "this permits to extend the definition of the standard part function to all the fractions which are of the form @xmath112 but whose limit exists finite .",
    "finally , because of the previous remark [ rem : p - poininnsa ] and of the isomorphism @xmath113 , we can always find an infinitesimal @xmath110}{[v]}\\in{}^{*}{{\\mathbb r}}_{\\text{frac}}$ ] which is not generated by an infinitesimal sequence @xmath114 ; of course , this fraction is of the form @xmath112 but the corresponding ratio of sequences does nt converge . ]",
    "to convey the full power of the idea , we have to go back to leibniz .",
    "leibniz introduced infinitesimal and infinite quantities , and developed a heuristic principle called the `` law of continuity '' , which had roots in the work of earlier scholars such as nicholas of cusa and johannes kepler .",
    "it is the principle that :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ what succeeds for the finite numbers succeeds also for the infinite numbers _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    ( see knobloch @xcite , robinson @xcite , and laugwitz @xcite ) .",
    "kepler had already used it to calculate the area of the circle by representing the latter as an infinite - sided polygon with infinitesimal sides , and summing the areas of infinitely many triangles with infinitesimal bases .",
    "leibniz used the law to extend concepts such as arithmetic operations , from ordinary numbers to infinitesimals , laying the groundwork for infinitesimal calculus .    of course , a modern mathematical version of this heuristic law depends on our formalization of the first word ` what ' in the law of continuity as stated above .",
    "we have already seen that this is almost trivial if what we mean by the leibnizian ` what ' is `` continuous equalities between real numbers '' .",
    "in fact we can extend arbitrary continuous functions as follows .",
    "recall that @xmath115 is the space of cauchy sequences of real numbers .",
    "[ def : extensionofcontinuousfunctions ] let @xmath116 be a continuous function .",
    "then we have @xmath117 for every @xmath118-tuple of cauchy sequences @xmath119 , and we can define the extension @xmath120 by setting @xmath121,\\dots,[u^{d}]\\right):= \\left[\\left(f(u_{n}^{1},\\dots , u_{n}^{d})\\right)_{n\\in{{\\mathbb n}}}\\right]_{\\sim}\\quad\\forall[u^{1}],\\dots,[u^{d}]\\in{{}^*{{\\mathbb r}}_\\text{f}}.\\ ] ]    this gives a true extension of @xmath122 , i.e. @xmath123 for every @xmath124 ( identified with the corresponding constant sequences ) .",
    "[ thm : elementarytransfer ] let @xmath122 , @xmath125 be continuous functions , then the equality @xmath126 is satisfied if and only if @xmath127 analogously , we can formulate the transfer of inequalities of the form @xmath128 .",
    "the equality implies @xmath129 where @xmath130=\\alpha_{k}$ ] .",
    "the whole set @xmath22 is dominant , and therefore follows .",
    "the converse implication follows from the fact that @xmath131 and @xmath132 extend @xmath122 and @xmath133 and from the embedding @xmath134 .",
    "the reader would have surely noted that some of the limitations we have presented can be avoided by generalizing our construction further .",
    "for example , the ring @xmath12 is only an integral domain and not a field , because it is not closed with respect to pointwise inverse , because the latter are not cauchy sequences .",
    "similarly , we can not extend a general function @xmath116 but only continuous functions because we need to ensure that the image sequence is cauchy .",
    "however , all the ideas we have introduced up to now work if we replace @xmath10 by the whole of @xmath135 . in this way",
    ", we obtain a field @xmath61 and arbitrary functions can be extended . in the setting of the ring @xmath12",
    "only continuous functions can be extended and hence a continuity hypothesis has to be assumed if one wants to use its infinitesimals",
    ". for more details , see goldblatt  @xcite . in the present article",
    ", we adhere to the framework of defining a new notion of completeness so as to add new infinitesimal points to  @xmath4 .",
    "we will motivate our definition by developing some powerful key properties of an infinitesimal - enriched extension of @xmath4 .",
    "can leibniz s law of continuity be proved for more general properties , e.g. for order relations or disjunctions of equality and inequality or even more general relations ? to solve this problem , we start , once again , from a historical consideration .    cauchy used infinitesimals to define continuity as follows : a function  @xmath122 is continuous between two bounds if for all @xmath136 between those bounds , the difference @xmath137 will be infinitesimal whenever @xmath138 is infinitesimal , see @xcite .    such a definition tends to bewilder a modern reader , used to thinking of @xmath122 as being defined for real values of the variable @xmath136 , but now we can think of @xmath139 as corresponding to @xmath140 .",
