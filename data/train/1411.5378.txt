    "the basic concepts and applications of equilibrium thermodynamics are among the most consolidated milestones in physics . on the other hand ,",
    "thermodynamic theories capable of describing non - equilibrium states and their time evolution are still at the forefront of research in physics , fostered by a wide variety of applications and new technologies that are in need of such modeling capability .",
    "various theories and approaches to non - equilibrium dynamics have been put forward since the pioneering work by onsager in 1931 @xcite .",
    "it is not our purpose here to review such huge scientific literature , nor to even acknowledge the many pioneers of this broad topic .",
    "therefore , the reader interested in such reconstructions should not start from our list of references .",
    "the scope of this paper is to compare two quite general geometrical constructions that have evolved independently , with somewhat different purposes , but that turn out to provide almost equivalent  or at least very closely related  dissipative structures that guarantee the compatibility of a non - equilibrium thermodynamics theory with the second law of thermodynamics .    at any level of description , the geometrization of a theory of non - equilibrium ( thermo)dynamics consists in identifying : ( a ) the state space @xmath0 assumed for the physical system under study , ( b ) the structure of this space , ( c ) the time evolution equation in terms of this structure , ( d ) the compatibility of dynamics with the statement of the second law of thermodynamics @xcite , and ( e ) the symmetry group of the theory , i.e. , the group preserving the geometrical structure of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "not all existing non - equilibrium thermodynamics theories have been clearly geometrized yet in this sense .",
    "however , much progress along these lines has been made and constitutes the background of the present work :    * classical mechanics has been formulated in an abstract ( general ) setting , in the context of geometric mechanics ( @xcite ) : the natural arenas are symplectic manifolds , and their generalization , i.e. , poisson manifolds .",
    "* equilibrium thermodynamics has been geometrized in the work by carathodory @xcite , the book by hermann @xcite , and  for example  the references in @xcite . * some formulations of non - equilibrium thermodynamics have been reformulated using the important geometric structure of _ metriplectic manifolds _ ( see some history and references in @xcite and @xcite ) . * in its most renowned presentation",
    ", metriplectic dynamics has been called _ general equation for the non - equilibrium reversible - irreversible coupling _ ( generic ) @xcite , which represents also a generalization in the context of _",
    "contact manifolds_. * an apparently less structured approach , _ steepest - entropy - ascent _ sea dynamics , was proposed in the simplest quantum thermodynamic landscape @xcite and in a general probabilistic framework @xcite , and recently adapted and generalized for meso- and macroscopic systems in @xcite .",
    "in general , a reversible evolution is modeled with an antisymmetric tensor , while the irreversible one with a symmetric object .",
    "when the latter is a tensor , clearly it may be represented by a kind of metric tensor .",
    "this is why below we shall associate dissipation with a metric tensor .",
    "although we shall focus here only on the mathematical formulation , it is worth noting that thermodynamic theories ( equilibrium and non - equilibrium ) have often been attached very different physical ( and philosophical ) interpretations .",
    "for example :    * the keenan school of thermodynamics has advanced the position that thermodynamics is valid at every scale and that entropy is an intrinsic property of matter which , like energy , builds up from the microscopic level . the sea geometrical approach originated from probing the extreme consequences of this line of reasoning , to seeing how the quantum dynamics should be modified if entropy and dissipation existed even microscopically . * on the other hand , the multiscale dynamics advanced by grmela sees thermodynamics as _ _ a meta - theory addressing relations among dynamical theories formulated on different levels of description__@xcite ; these relations are expressed in the framework of contact structures @xcite . at every scale there is a generic , and in passing from a more detailed level to a less detailed one through pattern recognition(or coarse graining @xcite ) one sees dissipation , even if microscopic dynamics is reversible .    our scope here is not to elaborate on any of these interpretational issues , nor on the operational definitions and empirical meanings of basic concepts such as energy and entropy .",
    "we take the view that , regardless of their interpretation , two theories are identical if their mathematical structures are equivalent .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ mathform ]",
    "we reformulate the sea and the generic approaches so as to emphasize their analogies and differences , which we further discuss in section [ discussion ] . in section",
    "[ be ] we implement our formalism to the case of the boltzmann equation . in section [ seavsgeneric ]",
    "we further elaborate our notation and analysis so as to establish when and in what sense sea and generic can be considered equivalent . in section [ conclusions ]",
    "we summarize our conclusions .",
    "in this section , we present a mathematical and abstract formulation of the sea and generic principles that allows a clear comparison between the respective underlying assumptions .",
    "to help the reader go through the mathematics and grasp the general meaning without getting sidetracked by the details , we will try to guide the reading as much as possible by adding some non - technical comments that , albeit strictly unnecessary from the mathematical point of view , are meant to allow a simpler interpretation of the abstract setup .",
    "we will focus on the dynamics . regarding the kinematics , for both sea and generic we will assume it to be given . in particular , when in section [ seavsgeneric ] we will derive relations between the structures of dissipative dynamics in sea and generic models , we will do under the assumption that the two models adopt the same kinematics . in general , for both sea and generic , the kinematics is chosen so that the state space is a banach manifold @xmath0 , i.e. , a manifold which  locally  is topologically equivalent to a banach space .",
    "the time evolution of the state is represented by a curve @xmath1 on @xmath0 , and this is an integral curve of a vector field ( the velocity vector is equal to the vector field at each point of the curve ) .",
    "the vector field is composed of two distinguished parts : the first one is a _",
    "reversible _ contribution , @xmath2 , which , depending on the framework , represents hamiltonian dynamics and/or the local effects of transport due to convective and diffusive fluxes between adjacent elements of a continuum ; the second one is a _ dissipative _ contribution , which models the irreversible aspects of the dynamics ( such as the dissipation of mechanical or electrical forms of energy into thermal energy ) responsible for the entropy production ( the local entropy production in the case of a continuum ) . in symbols ,",
    "the time evolution @xmath3 is an integral curve of the sum of the reversible and dissipative vector fields , @xmath4    our comparison between the sea and the generic constructions will focus the attention on the dissipative part because this has been the focus of the sea construction , namely to define the dissipative part @xmath5 in non - equilibrium frameworks where the reversible or transport part @xmath2 is prescribed by other considerations .",
    "instead , the generic construction provides specifications also for @xmath2 .    as we will see below in detail ,",
    "both the sea and the generic constructions assume that the dissipative part @xmath5 of the dynamical equation is directly related to the entropy differential . in the sea construction , it is related to the projection of the gradient of the local entropy functional onto a linear manifold orthogonal to the gradients of the local functionals representing the conserved properties . in the generic construction we consider in this article ( where @xmath0 is a metriplectic manifold ) , it is related to a weaker notion of gradient .",
    "first of all , also to establish the notation , we recall some basic notions of differential geometry .",
    "the most useful definition of ( tangent ) vector on a manifold passes through the concept of _ derivation_. a _ tangent vector _",
    "@xmath6 to a point @xmath7 of the manifold @xmath0 is a _ derivation _ on @xmath8 ; that is , a linear map @xmath9 which takes any smooth functional @xmath10 on @xmath0 , gives a real number @xmath11 and satisfies the _ leibniz rule _ @xmath12 for any functionals @xmath10 and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote their values at @xmath7 .",
    "the set of all tangent vectors to @xmath7 is a vector space , called the _ tangent space to @xmath0 at @xmath7 _ and denoted by @xmath16 .",
    "the disjoint union of all tangent spaces is the _ tangent bundle _ , denoted by @xmath17 .",
    "a _ vector field _",
    "@xmath18 is a map @xmath19 with the property that @xmath20 @xmath21 : i.e. , it assigns a tangent vector @xmath22 in @xmath16 to each point @xmath7 of @xmath0 .    by referring to the model space of the manifold",
    ", one may express a tangent vector by the linear combination @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a basis of derivations for the tangent space , or ",
    "in other words  the partial derivatives with respect to the coordinates . by the same consideration , one is allowed to see @xmath11 as the _ directional derivative _ of @xmath10 at @xmath7 along the tangent vector @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , one may define the _ cotangent space at @xmath7 _ ( @xmath25 ) as the space of all linear functionals ( named _ covectors _ ) on @xmath16 .",
    "the disjoint union of all cotangent spaces is the _ cotangent bundle _ @xmath26 .",
    "the most important of these linear functionals is the _ differential _ @xmath27 of a smooth functional @xmath10 on @xmath0 , which computes the directional derivatives of @xmath10 at every point @xmath7 of @xmath0 along the tangent vectors to @xmath7 , i.e. , at each point @xmath7 takes any tangent vector @xmath6 as input and yields the directional derivative @xmath11 as output , @xmath28    the notion of gradient of a smooth functional requires an additional structure on the manifold .",
    "indeed , it can be defined in an invariant way ( i.e. , independent of the choice of coordinates ) only with respect to a non - degenerate bilinear map on the tangent bundle ( or some sub - bundle ) , which essentially equips the manifold with a metric .",
    "the most common case is represented by _ ( strong ) riemannian manifolds_. these are defined as pairs of a smooth manifold and a ( strongly non - degenerate ) riemannian metric tensor field @xmath29 which , at every point @xmath7 of @xmath0 takes as input two vectors in the tangent space @xmath16 , and yields @xmath30 with @xmath31 for any nonzero @xmath32 and @xmath6 .",
    "the property of strong non - degeneracy implies that the vector bundle ( linear ) map ( at every point @xmath7 ) @xmath33 , defined by @xmath34 ( v_p ) = g_p(u_p , v_p )   \\qquad \\forall   v_p \\in t_p\\mathcal{m}\\ , \\ ] ] which brings a vector @xmath32 into the covector @xmath35 ( i.e. , into a linear functional on the tangent space at @xmath7 ) , is an isomorphism ( often called _ musical isomorphism _ ) .",
    "therefore , the inverse map @xmath36 is defined too .",
    "we may also define the inversemetric tensor , or _",
    "co - metric tensor _ by @xmath37{180}{$g$}}_p(\\omega_p , \\eta_p )",
    "= g_p \\!\\left(g^\\sharp_p ( \\omega_p ) , g^\\sharp_p ( \\eta_p ) \\right)\\ .\\ ] ]    in coordinates and finite dimensions , a physicist would talk about _ lowering _ and _ raising the indexes _ :",
    "@xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are respectively the components of a vector and a covector with respect to some chosen basis for the tangent space @xmath16 and the cotangent space @xmath41 ; @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the matrix representations of the maps @xmath44 and @xmath45 with respect to the same bases , and of course @xmath46 = \\left[g_{p , ij}\\right]^{-1}$ ] .",
    "one then defines the _ gradient _ at @xmath7 of a smooth functional @xmath10 to be the only vector at @xmath7 satisfying @xmath47 uniqueness is guaranteed by the non - degeneracy of the metric field .",
    "this may also be restated more explicitly as @xmath48    when @xmath0 is a vector space @xmath49 , the tangent space to each point @xmath7 may be identified with the vector space itself ( we write @xmath50 ) .",
    "moreover , if the vector space is a hilbert space @xmath51 , it is equipped with an inner product , i.e. , a non - degenerate bilinear map @xmath52 if we take the manifold viewpoint , this may also be seen as @xmath53 since @xmath54 .",
    "then the particular _ gradient _ of a functional @xmath10 at point @xmath55 , called _ variational derivative _ of @xmath10 , is defined implicitly by @xmath56 given the inner product , we may denote by @xmath57 the riesz isomorphism @xmath58 such that @xmath59 and hence we may alternatively define the variational derivative explicitly by @xmath60    when both structures ( an inner product and a metric ) are present on a hilbert space @xmath51 , we have @xmath61 where @xmath62 denotes the inverse of the positive definite and symmetric linear operator @xmath63 defined by @xmath64      the steepest entropy ascent ( sea ) principle to model the non - equilibrium dynamics of a thermodynamic system was originally proposed as part of an attempt to design a thermodynamically consistent dynamical law for a unified quantum theory of mechanics and thermodynamics obtained by embedding the second law directly into the set of fundamental postulates @xcite .",
    "subsequently it was extended as a generic modeling tool for probabilistic , constrained maximum entropy landscapes @xcite . since in these landscapes",
    "the state representative is a probability distribution or its quantum equivalent , the density operator , it seemed natural to define gradients with respect to the fisher - rao metric which is known to exhibit the required invariance features in the absence of additional physical constraints .",
    "however , the fisher metric is not general enough to reproduce the dynamics in other non - equilibrium thermodynamics frameworks . therefore , an extension of the sea formulation that adopts a generic metric has been provided in @xcite . in this section",
    "we present the structure of such more general formulation .",
    "actually , as part of our effort to cast the construction in the language of differential geometry , we first present a further generalization whereby the state space is not required to be a vector space but may be any ( banach ) manifold , then we present the original formulation where the state manifold is equipped with an inner product so that variational derivatives are defined .",
    "the idea behind the sea construction is to geometrizethe thermodynamic state space and assume that the part of the local evolution equation that is responsible for irreversible dynamics is in the directionof maximal entropy production compatible with the local conservation constraints .",
    "the formulation of the sea principle may be expressed as follows : _ the time evolution of the local state is the result of a balance between the effects of transport or hamiltonian dynamics and the spontaneous and irreversible tendency to advance the local state representative in the direction of maximal entropy production per unit of distance traveled in state space compatible with the conservation constraints _ @xcite .    the mathematical implementation consists in assuming that the dissipative part of the dynamics pushes the states in the direction of the gradient of the restriction of the entropy functional onto the submanifold with constant values of the conserved quantities .",
    "therefore , the dissipative vector field is assumed to point in the direction of maximal directional derivative of the entropy compatible with the conservation constraints .",
    "each thermodynamically consistent non - equilibrium theory assumes a level of description for a given physical system ( possibly modeled as a continuum ) which mathematically amounts to assuming :    * a ( possibly infinite - dimensional ) smooth real banach manifold @xmath0 whose points represent the possible states of the system or , for nonequilibrium states of a continuum , the possible local states at position @xmath65 ; * a set of functionals @xmath66 , which represent the conserved properties of the system or , for a continuum , the local densities of the conserved properties ; we denote the submanifold @xmath67 with @xmath68 ; * another functional @xmath69 , which represents the thermodynamic entropy @xcite of the system or , for a continuum , the local entropy density ; * for each submanifold @xmath68 , a ( strongly non - degenerate ) metric tensor field @xmath70 which , at every point @xmath7 of the submanifold @xmath71 , takes as input two vectors in the tangent space @xmath72 , and yields @xmath73 with @xmath31 for any nonzero @xmath32 and @xmath6 , and is such that the map @xmath74 defines a smooth ( @xmath75 ) map on @xmath0 .",
    "the condition that defines the space @xmath72 tangent to the constrained submanifold @xmath71 is @xmath76    this situation essentially defines a _ sub - riemannian _ structure on @xmath0 .",

    ", which represents the reversible components of the system dynamics or , for a continuum , the local net effects of transport of properties between adjacent elements of the continuum , are assumed to be given features of the level of description and coarse graining of the modeling framework in which the sea construction is to be implemented .",

    "we recover the usual form of the generic , @xmath211",
    "the reformulation of the sea model in the language of differential geometry makes it more easily comparable to the generic model .",

    "hence , we shall focus on the dissipative part , analyzing similarities and differences between the two models and highlighting the aspects not completely clear and deserving further analyses .",
    "the following subsections are not meant to be sequential .",
    "they can also be read in another order .      in their original article @xcite",
    ", the authors declared the two main purposes of generic :    1 .   to reproduce known equations of motion of known physical theories by casting them in a single abstract form ; 2 .   to suggest new equations for new thermodynamic theories dealing with complex systems .",
    "the goal of the sea method @xcite applied to meso- and macroscopic systems was similar :    1 .   to show that a broad selection of known theoretical frameworks for the description of non - equilibrium thermodynamics at various levels of description can all be unified when viewed as implementations of the sea principle ; 2 .   to provide rigorous mathematical formalization of the so - called maximum entropy production ( mep ) principle , as an attempt to clarifying its meaning , scope and domain of validity",
    "; 3 .   to propose a formalization of known theories which reduces to the linear theories in the proximity of equilibrium , entailing onsager reciprocity . hence , showing that such theories are indeed sea with respect to any metric that at equilibrium reduces to a generalized onsager conductivity matrix .",
    "however , the original sea formulation developed for a very speculative and controversial quantum thermodynamics framework , motivated by the additional fundamental goal to provide a technically consistent connection between a wealth of heuristic discussions about the second law and the arrow of time in the 70 s and 80 s .",
    "the attempt consisted in constructing a dynamical theory compatible with the lyapunov stability requirement suggested by the hatsopoulos - keenan statement of the second law of thermodynamics @xcite whereby the maximum entropy states must be the only equilibrium states of the dynamics that are conditionally stable in the technical sense defined in ref .",
    "@xcite , as already discussed above .      in the generic model ,",
    "the degeneracy condition imposed on the geometrical structure of the manifold implies that every distinguished functional of the dissipative bracket can not vary along the dissipative vector field .",
    "the entropy gradient@xmath212 is automatically parallel to the level sets of all the distinguished functionals ( thus , for example , to the level sets of energy ) , i.e. , @xmath213 = 0 ; \\ ] ] for every distinguished functional @xmath10 of the dissipative bracket . in other words ,",
    "the information of constancy of the conserved functionals is contained already in the co - metric tensor @xmath214 .",
    "the sea model adopts a sub - riemannian structure @xcite .",
    "the conserved properties are constant on the submanifolds where purely dissipative time evolution takes place , and the condition defines a _ distribution _",
    "@xmath215 @xcite through @xmath216 since the @xmath90 s need not necessarily be linearly independent everywhere , the distribution may be _",
    "singular_. on this distribution one introduces a metric @xmath217 with @xmath31 for any nonzero @xmath32 and @xmath6 .",
    "hereafter , we shall consider finite - dimensional manifolds , because the theorems we will mention are valid for this case .",
    "the distribution is _ integrable _ , i.e. , we can find  for each point @xmath7  an _ integral _ submanifold @xmath68 containing @xmath7 and such that @xmath218 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) : they are the intersections of the level sets of the conserved functionals .",
    "that is why , in paragraph [ seageneralized ] , we decided to give the more naiveviewpoint , focusing on the integral submanifolds of the distribution rather than the distribution itself .",
    "the geometric structure of the dissipative dynamics of metriplectic manifolds is also similar to a sub - riemannian structure , but the distribution @xmath219 is not necessarily integrable .    if , however , we impose the condition @xmath220 we return to the previous situation .",
    "this condition means that all the degeneracies in the generic model are related to conservation laws . in this case , as we will see in section [ seavsgeneric ] , the sea and generic formalisms are perfectly equivalent .",
    "the generic model is more similar in spirit to classical mechanics , where the integrals of motion are generally unknown , and finding them is often a great challenge . in the sea framework , conversely , knowing them is essential for the geometrical construction itself .",
    "a pictorial visualization of the difference between the two constructions can be obtained by introducing in generic the concepts of _ symplectic leaves _ and _ metric leaves_. symplectic leaves are the submanifolds on which purely hamiltonian evolution would take place ( i.e. , assuming the dissipative vector @xmath5 set identically to zero ) @xcite .",
    "metric leaves are instead the submanifolds where purely dissipative dynamics would take place ( i.e. , assuming the reversible vector @xmath2 set identically to zero ) . in the context of generic dynamics , the degeneracy condition implies that symplectic leaves are at constant entropy ( and the other distinguished functionals of the poisson bracket ) while the degeneracy condition implies that metric leaves are at constant energy ( and the other distinguished functionals of the dissipative bracket ) .",
    "moreover , for an overall closed and isolated thermodynamic system , the time - independent hamiltonian functional is a constant of motion and , therefore , both the reversible vector @xmath2 and the dissipative vector @xmath5 lie in a metric leaf .",
    "hence , the generic dynamics can not leave a particular metric leaf : each trajectory is effectively constrained on a single metric leaf , as shown pictorially in figure [ metric leaf picture ] .",
    "figure [ symplectic metric leaves ] illustrates the relationship between metric leaves , where generic dynamics ( of an overall closed and isolated thermodynamic system ) takes place , and symplectic leaves , where purely hamiltonian dynamics takes place .",
    "metric leaves are surfaces with constant energy , while the symplectic leaves are surfaces with constant entropy ( because hamiltonian dynamics is reversible ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the intersection of symplectic leaves on a metric leaf produces isentropic contours and the generic reversible vector @xmath2 ( for an overall closed and isolated thermodynamic system ) is always contained in such intersection .",
    "lies in the intersection of the metric leaf of the time evolution of an isolated system with the symplectic leaf ( isentropic surface ) being crossed at time @xmath221 by the time evolution . ]    in the sea picture the situation is different for two reasons .",
    "the first is that the sea model is not meant to be restricted to the modeling of overall closed and isolated systems .",
    "therefore , the condition imposed within generic that the vector field @xmath2 must be preserving the overall entropy is not necessarily imposed . of course , for an isolated system the sea construction can be made generic by imposing the corresponding degeneracy onto the metric tensor .",
    "but the sea model is meant to apply also for the description of a continuum subjected to general boundary conditions . by assuming a local state description instead of a global one , in terms of the local entropy density functional @xmath222 and the local ( lagrangian ) entropy flux @xmath223",
    ", it allows one to write the local entropy balance equation in the usual form @xmath224 where @xmath225 represents the net rate of entropy outflow due to entropy - exchanging interactions between the local element of continuum and its neighbors , and of course it can not be assumed equal to zero , due to the presence in general of convective and diffusive fluxes of entropy , whereby also its volume integral is in general nonzero .",
    "the local entropy production density @xmath226 ( often denoted by @xmath227 in non - equilibrium thermodynamics ) is controlled by the dissipative vector field @xmath5 while the transport term @xmath225 is controlled by the reversible vector field @xmath2 ( which of course controls also the local fluxes of other properties such as mass , momentum , angular momentum , energy ) . in order for generic to be extended",
    "so as to include this class of descriptions , the degeneracy condition must be relaxed so as to properly account for mass , momentum , angular momentum , energy , and entropy fluxes across the boundaries of the system .",
    "some progress in this direction has been already made in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this version of the generic ( without imposing eq .  ) could be made more similar to the sea spirit of entropy production maximization by imposing an additional restriction on the generic structure , as we point out below .",
    "as is known from poisson geometry , where poisson manifolds foliate into symplectic leaves , a generalized distribution is integrable if and only if it is generated by a family of smooth vector fields , and is invariant with respect to their flows .",
    "this is the statement of the stefan - sussmann theorem @xcite , which is a generalization for singular distributions of the famous frobenius theorem . in classical mechanics , the condition that assures",
    "this integrability is the jacobi identity , since it forces hamiltonian flows to be canonical transformations ( poisson maps ) , that is , to preserve the poisson structure .    in the generic model",
    ", the time evolution of the state does not necessarily preserve the co - metric tensor , since dissipative flows themselves are not assumed to preserve the co - metric structure .",
    "for this reason , the distribution @xmath219 is not integrable .",
    "instead , we note here that if we additionally endowed the dissipative structure with the _ leibniz identity _ @xmath228 , c \\right ] = \\left [ a , \\left [ b , c \\right ] \\right ] + \\left [ \\left [ a , c \\right ] , b \\right ] , \\ ] ] which is a generalization of jacobi identity for non skew - symmetric brackets @xcite , we would obtain that dissipative flows preserve the co - metric tensor , thus guaranteeing the integrability of the generalized distribution @xmath219 to metric leaves .",
    "then , on metric leaves , we would gain a ( non - degenerate ) metric , we could calculate distances with it , and we could define gradients by eq .  .",
    "in this case , we could also interpret generic dynamics as a sea dynamics on metric leaves .",
    "we may also express this result in general terms as follows .",
    "suppose , for a moment , that there is only dissipative dynamics , so that time evolution is confined on a metric leaf in which the degenerate contravariant tensor @xmath214 is restricted into the non - degenerate one @xmath229 . in this way , we can build the corresponding covariant metric tensor @xmath230 , which acts on vectors as @xmath231 in finite dimension , it has matrix @xmath232 = [ d_l^{ij}]^{-1}$ ] ( for a more rigorous treatment of this procedure for the case of symplectic leaves , see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , in the spirit of the variational formulation of the sea construction , let us consider all unit vectors @xmath233 at state @xmath7 ( @xmath234 ) and search for the one that gives the maximal directional derivative of the entropy functional . by definition of gradient of a smooth functional ( given the non - degenerate bilinear form @xmath230 ) and the cauchy - schwarz inequality , we have @xmath235 that is , the absolute value of the directional derivative is always smaller than the norm of the gradient vector , and reaches its maximum value when @xmath236 the restriction of the total entropy gradient@xmath208 to the metric leaf is indeed @xmath237 , which is sometimes called _",
    "horizontal gradient_. therefore , any nonequilibrium dynamics that can be written in generic form and which satisfies the leibniz identity is automatically sea on metric leaves .",
    "however , while the jacobi identity is a well - known feature of reversible dynamics with deep physical roots in classical mechanics , imposing an analogous condition on the dissipative structure is less founded on physical grounds .",
    "for example , we leave it for further investigations to determine whether eq .",
    "is satisfied and whether the time evolution preserves the whole geometric structure in some of the mesoscopic thermodynamic formulations of dynamics in which the state description is in terms of a maximum entropy family .",
    "such frameworks essentially adopt a kinematics compatible with some version of the maximum entropy formalism ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) whereby the nonequilibrium thermodynamic states are assumed to belong to the maximum entropy manifold defined by the local instantaneous values of a given set of mesoscopic properties chosen as the internal variablesof the system . typically , this is the set of the constants of the motion augmented by a sufficient number of slowly varying additional properties characterizing some constraints(in the sense of ref .",
    "@xcite ) or some relevant information that must be included in the analysis(in the information theory sense , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "for example , the recent ref .",
    "@xcite assumes a maximum entropy kinematics of this kind and constructs on it a contact - structure - preserving dynamics which effectively combines hamiltonian and sea dynamics .",
    "again , ref .",
    "@xcite provides another example of maximal - entropy - generation model dynamics for a maximum - entropy discrete - probability - distribution landscape with time - dependent constraints .",
    "once the state space has been chosen , namely , the manifold where a thermodynamic process occurs , the sea construction determines in a unique way the local direction of evolution at every point on the manifold and hence the trajectories of time evolution , but in order to do so it requires a choice for the notion of distance between states , i.e. , more generally , the choice of a metric field on the tangent space to the submanifold with constant values of the conserved functionals .",
    "this choice represents the modeling knobthat allows the description of different physical behaviors of the system . in other words , systems with identical kinematics and hence identical state spaces",
    "may exhibit different non - equilibrium dynamics : when in the same state they evolve differently .",
    "it is the metric field @xmath70 which characterizes the non - equilibrium behavior of the system .",
    "as argued in @xcite , near equilibrium the metric is directly related to the onsager matrix of generalized resistances .",
    "it is clear that the rate of evolution along the sea trajectories is also regulated by the metric , since the velocity of a curve parametrized by time @xmath238 is the scalar @xmath239 which can be scaled by a constant in the metric tensor .    in the original quantum thermodynamic formulation of the sea model , a metric ( the fisher - rao metric )",
    "was chosen _",
    "ab initio _ : this was inspired by the fact that the state is , essentially , a probability measure and the interest was focused on identifying the simplest irreversible dynamics capable of incorporating the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "the velocity along the sea trajectory was scaled by the scalar @xmath88 which is allowed to be a functional of the state , i.e. , to assume different values along the trajectory in state space . in that simplest context @xmath88",
    "represents also the single relaxation time of the physical system being modeled . as shown in (",
    "* eq . ( 87 ) ) , @xmath88 can be interpreted as an entropic timebecause when time @xmath238 is measured in units of @xmath88 the speedalong the sea trajectory is equal to the local rate of entropy increase along the trajectory .",
    "moreover , @xmath88 is the lagrange multiplier of the geometrical constraint in the lagrangian of the variational formulation of the sea principle ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 72 ) ) . from the modeling point of view",
    ", @xmath88 is the only knob to scale and control the _ strength of the attraction in the sea direction _ along the trajectories of the dynamics .    here , however , we consider more general physical modeling contexts that include the various frameworks explicitly considered in @xcite , such as in complex chemical kinetics , or when multiple dissipative kinetic mechanisms give rise even far from equilibrium to onsager - like couplings ( like in thermodiffusion , thermoelectricity , etc . ) , or when isotropy is broken by the presence of phase interfaces or boundaries , or when preferential directions are imposed by externally applied fields",
    ". then , the sea model must account for the multiple relaxation times in effect and this is obtained by assuming a non - isotropic ( non fisher - rao ) local metric tensor field , i.e. , the operator @xmath240 introduced in @xcite , whose different eigenvalues represent the different local relaxation times up to a common scale factor .    in these more general contexts ,",
    "the state dependence of the local metric tensor incorporates the information about the different kinetic mechanisms in act and their interplay , and fixes the ratios between all pairs of different relaxation times .",
    "the entropic time @xmath88 could be set to unity and thus absorbed in the metric tensor , but in the present work we prefer to show it explicitly for two reasons .",
    "the first is that we wish to maintain a closer formal analogy between the structure of the sea dissipative vector resulting from eq .   and its equivalent in the original quantum thermodynamics framework .",
    "the second reason is to emphasize a somewhat philosophical difference between the generic and sea approaches .",
    "in fact , the choice considered more naturalin generic is to embed all the information about the dissipative part of the dynamics inside a single mathematical object , the friction operator . instead , the naturalchoice in the sea construction is to single out the three distinct geometrical aspects of the formalism by embedding them in three separate concepts : ( 1 ) the foliation of the state space induced by the constants of the motion ; ( 2 ) the metric field that defines the constrained entropy gradient needed to identify the sea direction on the corresponding tangent space and , physically , incorporates the information about couplings and relaxation times of the different dissipative mechanisms in play ; and ( 3 ) the entropic time @xmath88 which regulates the speed with which the state evolves along the sea path in state space .",

    "we have shown that when @xmath388 is constructed so that its kernel @xmath368 coincides with the linear span of the functional derivatives @xmath102 of the time - invariant state functionals and its restriction to @xmath374 is non - negative definite and symmetric , then the model is essentially sea . *",
    "the generic friction operator @xmath388 incorporates both the information about the constants of the motion ( it projects onto the local metric leaf orthogonal to their variational derivatives ) and the information about the local metric on such leaf so that when applied to the entropy variational derivative it essentially identifies the sea direction compatible with the conservation constraints .",
    "in other words , in the generic formalism the conservation laws are embedded in the degeneracy of the two assumed geometrical structures , while the sea formalism assumes that the conservation constraints are given explicitly so as to determine the submanifolds where the purely dissipative time evolutions would lie and unfold along the direction of sea with respect to a metric .",
    "the metric represents the couplings and characteristic times of the different dissipative mechanisms in act . * in sea dynamics",
    ", the choice of a non - degenerate metric allows one to univocally define gradients , while in the generic formalism , the choice of a degenerate metric makes it impossible to define a metric and , thus , a gradient , unless a further condition on the dissipative bracket is imposed . * for the description of a continuum , sea dynamics emerges as a local theory that starts from the local balance equations and implements the assumption of maximal local entropy production density compatible with the local conservation constraints , while the generic formalism emerges as a global theory that implements an entropy gradient dynamics compatible with the global conservation constraints .",
    "nevertheless , in this paper we show that the descriptions of the dissipative components of the dynamics in the two theories are very closely related , and in some important instances entirely equivalent .",
    "this is the case , for example , of the boltzmann equation , that we work out explicitly in both frameworks not only for illustrative purposes but also to prove the new result that the already known generic form of the collision integral can also be given a sea form .",
    "the two models have emerged in kinetic theory with different motivations . on one hand , sea dynamics  which",
    "was originally developed @xcite as an attempt to understand the fundamental consequences of an attempt to construct a theory of quantum thermodynamics by embedding the second law directly into quantum theory  has been adapted to the framework of kinetic theory with the aim of finding a _ simplified _ metric to model the collision integral @xcite , in order to create efficient kinetic models capable of extending to the highly non - equilibrium regime traditional near - equilibrium models such as bgk and es - bgk . on the other hand , generic , according to one of the two purposes for which the model was developed by its authors , aims at proving that the boltzmann equation is a realization of their general abstract dynamics .",
    "* the reversible - part formalism that generic borrows from geometric mechanics may be trasferredto sea in order to have a more complete model that explicitly considers hamiltonian dynamics ; * the idea of imposing that the dissipative bracket in generic satisfies the _ leibniz identity _ in order to have a non - degenerate metric on the metric leaves , could be tested in practical instances by a symbolic algorithm as done for the jacobi identity in @xcite ; * as far as open systems are concerned , a parallel could be undertaken between the approach used in @xcite and the mathematical framework of dirac structures , which the authors of generic claim to play a role in this kind of modeling @xcite .",

    "<S> by reformulating the steepest - entropy - ascent ( sea ) dynamical model for non - equilibrium thermodynamics in the mathematical language of differential geometry , we compare it with the primitive formulation of the generic model and discuss the main technical differences of the two approaches . in both dynamical models </S>",
    "<S> the description of dissipation is of the entropy - gradienttype . </S>",
    "<S> sea focuses only onto the irreversible component of the time evolution , chooses a sub - riemannian metric tensor as dissipative structure , and uses the local entropy density field as potential . </S>",
    "<S> generic emphasizes the coupling between the reversible and irreversible components of the time evolution , chooses two compatible degenerate structures ( poisson and degenerate co - riemannian ) , and uses the global energy and entropy functionals as potentials . as an illustration , we rewrite the known generic formulation of the boltzmann equation in terms of the square - root of the distribution function adopted by the sea formulation . </S>",
    "<S> we then provide a formal proof that in more general frameworks , whenever all degeneracies in the generic framework are related to conservation laws , the sea and generic models of the irreversible component of the dynamics are essentially interchangeable , provided of course they assume the same kinematics . as part of the discussion , we note that equipping the dissipative structure of generic with the leibniz identity makes it automatically sea on metric leaves . </S>"
