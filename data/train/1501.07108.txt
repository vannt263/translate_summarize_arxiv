    "therefore , circle graphs are the same as 2-word - representable graphs .",
    "+ * * comparability graphs . *",
    "a comparability graph is one that admits a transitive orientation of the edges , i.e. an assignment of directions to the edges such that the adjacency relation of the resulting digraph is transitive : the existence of arcs @xmath19 and @xmath20 yields that @xmath21 is an arc . such a digraph induces a poset on the set of vertices @xmath2 .",
    "note that each poset is an intersection of several linear orders and each linear order corresponds to some permutation @xmath22 of @xmath2 .",
    "these permutations can be concatenated to a word of the form @xmath23 . then",
    "two letters alternate in this word if and only if they are in the same order in each permutation ( linear order ) , and this means that they are comparable in the poset and , thus , the corresponding letters are adjacent in the graph .",

    "a corollary of our main structural result in this paper is that the class of word - representable graphs contains all 3-colorable graphs .",

    "clearly , comparability graphs ( i.e. those admitting transitive orientations ) are semi - transitive .",
    "the main result of this paper is theorem  [ thm : rep - equals - semi - trans ] saying that a graph is word - representable if and only if it admits a semi - transitive orientation .",

    "our bound on the representation number is tight up to a constant factor , as we construct graphs with representation number @xmath11 .",
    "we also show that deciding if a word - representable graph is @xmath8-word - representable is np - complete for @xmath34 .",
    "one corollary of the structural result is that all 3-colorable graphs are word - representable graphs .",
    "the containment properly subsumes all previously known classes of word - representable graphs : outerplanar graphs , prisms , and comparability graphs .",

    "this captures typical situations in periodic scheduling , where there are recurring _ precedence _ requirements . when tasks occur only once , the pairwise requirements form precedence constraints , which are modeled by partial orders . when the orientation of the constraints is omitted , the resulting pairwise constraints form comparability graphs .",
    "the focus of this paper is to study the class of undirected graphs induced by the alternation relationship of recurring tasks .",
    "consider , e.g. the following five tasks that may be involved in operation of a given machine : 1 ) initialize controller , 2 ) drain excess fluid , 3 ) obtain permission from supervisor , 4 ) ignite motor , 5 ) check oil level .",
    "tasks 1 & 2 , 2 & 3 , 3 & 4 , 4 & 5 , and 5 & 1 are expected to alternate between all repetitions of the events .",

    ". + * related work . * the notion of directed word - representable graphs was introduced in  @xcite to obtain asymptotic bounds on the free spectrum of the widely - studied _ perkins semigroup _ , which has played central role in semigroup theory since 1960 , particularly as a source of examples and counterexamples . in @xcite ,",
    "numerous properties of word - representable graphs were derived and several types of word - representable and non - word - representable graphs pinpointed .",
    "some open questions from @xcite were resolved recently in @xcite , including the representability of the petersen graph .",
    "circle graphs were generalized to polygon - circle graphs ( see @xcite ) , which are the intersection graphs of polygons inscribed in a circle .",
    "if we view each polygon as a letter and read the incidences of the polygons on the circle in order , we see that two polygons intersect if and only if there _ exists _ a pair of occurrences of the two polygons that alternate .",
    "this differs from word - representable graphs where _ all _ occurrences of the two letters must alternate in order for the nodes to be adjacent .",
    "cyclic ( or periodic ) scheduling problems have been studied extensively in the operations research literature @xcite , as well as in the ai literature @xcite .",
    "these are typically formulated with more general constraints , where , e.g. the 10th occurrence of task a must be preceded by the 5th occurrence of task b. the focus of this work is then on obtaining effective periodic schedules , while maintaining a small cycle time .",
    "we are , however , not aware of work on characterizing the graphs formed by the cyclic precedence constraints . a different periodic scheduling application related to word - representable graphs",
    "was considered by graham and zang @xcite , whose work involves a counting problem related to the cyclic movements of a robot arm .",
    "more generally , given a set of jobs to be performed periodically , certain pairs @xmath35 must be done alternately , e.g.  since the product of job @xmath36 is used as a resource for job @xmath37 .",
    "any valid execution sequence corresponds to a word over the alphabet formed by the jobs .",
    "the word - representable graph given by such a word must then contain the constraint pairs as a subgraph .",
    "the preliminary version of this work , that appeared in @xcite , claimed an upper bound of @xmath9 on the representation number .",
    "this was based on a lemma ( lemma 2 in @xcite ) that turned out to be false .",

    "we explore , in section  [ classif ] , which classes of graphs are word - representable , and show , in particular , that 3-colorable graphs are such graphs , but numerous other properties are independent from the property of being word - representable . finally , we conclude with two open problems in section  [ open ] .",

    "since @xmath158 and @xmath159 are not comparable for each @xmath134 , their must be a linear order where @xmath160 . if we have in some linear order both @xmath160 and @xmath161 for @xmath156 , then either @xmath162 or @xmath163 in it .",
    "in the first case we have that @xmath164 , in the second that @xmath165 .",
    "but each of these inequalities contradicts the definition of the poset .",
    "therefore , @xmath166 .",
    "in order to show that @xmath167 we can consider a linear order @xmath168 together with all linear orders obtained from this order by the simultaneous exchange of @xmath169 and @xmath170 with @xmath171 and @xmath172 respectively ( @xmath173 ) .",
    "it can be verified that the intersection of these @xmath8 linear orders coincides with our poset .",
    "now we can prove theorem  [ thm : example ] .",
    "since the crown graph @xmath145 is a comparability graph of the poset @xmath80 , we deduce from lemmas  [ cocktail ] and  [ obs : dimension ] that @xmath145 is a permutational @xmath8-word - representable graph but not a permutational @xmath174-word - representable graph .",
    "then by lemma  [ obs : rep - permrep ] we have that @xmath147 is a @xmath8-word - representable graph but not a @xmath174-word - representable graph .",
    "theorem  [ thm : example ] is proved .",
    "the above arguments help us also in deciding the complexity of determining the representation number . from lemmas [ obs : rep - permrep ] and",
    "[ obs : dimension ] , we see that it is as hard as determining the dimension @xmath8 of a poset .",
    "yannakakis @xcite showed that the latter is np - hard , for any @xmath175 .",
    "we therefore obtain the following result .",
    "[ prop1 ] deciding whether a given graph is a @xmath8-word - representable graph , for any given @xmath176 , is np - complete .",
    "it was shown that it is also np - hard to approximate the dimension of a poset within @xmath177-factor @xcite , and this has recently been strengthened to and @xmath178-factor @xcite .",
    "we therefore obtain the same hardness for the representation number .",
    "approximating the representation number within @xmath178-factor is np - hard , for any @xmath179 .",
    "that is , for every constant @xmath180 , it is an np - complete problem to decide whether a given word - representable graph has representation number at most @xmath181 , or it has representation number greater than @xmath181 .",
    "[ prop : approx ]    in contrast with these hardness results , the case @xmath182 turns out to be easier and admits a succinct characterization .",
    "the following fact essentially appears in  @xcite . recall that a graph is called",
    "_ a circle graph _",
    "if we can arrange its vertices as chords on a circle in such a way that two nodes in the graph are adjacent if and only if the corresponding chords overlap .",
    "[ 2repr ] a graph is 2-word representable if and only if it is a circle graph .",
    "indeed , given a circle graph @xmath7 , consider the ends of the chords on a circle as a letters and read the obtained word in a clockwise order starting from an arbitrary point .",
    "it is easy to see that two chords intersect if and only if the corresponding letters alternate in the word . for the opposite direction , place @xmath10 nodes at a circle in the same order as they meet in the word and connect the same letters by chords .",
    "since outerplanar graphs are 2-word representable it follows from theorems  [ 2repr ] that outerplanar graphs are circle graphs .",
    "theorem  [ 2repr ] can also be useful as a tool in proving that a graph is not a circle graph .",
    "for example , non - word - representable graphs ( for instance , all odd wheels @xmath183 for @xmath184 ) are not circle graphs .",
    "when faced with a new graph class , the most basic questions involve the kind of properties it satisfies : which known classes are properly contained ( and which not ) , which graphs are otherwise contained ( and which not ) , what operations preserve word representability ( or non - representability ) , and which properties hold for these graphs .    previously , it was known that the class of word - representable graphs includes comparability graphs , outerplanar graphs , subdivision graphs , and prisms .",
    "the purpose of this section is to clarify this situation significantly , including resolving some conjectures .",
    "we start with exploring the relation of colorability and representability .",
    "@xmath185-colorable graphs are word - representable .",
    "[ cor:3col ]    given a 3-coloring of a graph @xmath7 , direct the edges from the first color class through the second to the third class .",
    "it is easy to see that we obtain a semi - transitive digraph .",
    "thus , by theorem .",
    "[ thm : rep - equals - semi - trans ] , the graph is word - representable .",
    "this implies a number of earlier results on word - representability , including that of outerplanar graphs , subdivision graphs , and prisms @xcite .",
    "the theorem also shows that 2-degenerate graphs ( graphs in which every subgraph has a vertex of degree at most 2 ) and sub - cubic graphs ( graphs of maximum degree 3 , via brooks theorem ) are word - representable .",
    "note , however , that the bound of @xmath38 for the representability number can be improved for 3-colorable graphs .    [ impr:3col ]",
    "@xmath185-colorable graphs are @xmath186-word - representable .",
    "let @xmath7 be a 3-colorable graph .",
    "suppose that the vertices of @xmath7 are partitioned into three independent sets @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath187 .",

    "direct the edges of @xmath7 from @xmath83 to @xmath188 and from @xmath84 to @xmath187 and denote the obtained orientation by @xmath78 .",

    ", one can show that @xmath207 covers all non - edges lying inside @xmath83 and @xmath84 and all non - edges incident with @xmath76 .",
    "concatenating all these words , we obtain a @xmath153-uniform word @xmath1 representing @xmath7 , where @xmath208 . since @xmath84 has the largest cardinality , @xmath209 .",

    "the examples in fig .  [",
    "small ] show that 4-colorable graphs can be non - word - representable .",
    "we can , however , obtain a result in terms of the _ girth _ of the graph , which is the length of its shortest cycle .",
    "let @xmath7 be a graph whose girth is greater than its chromatic number .",
    "then , @xmath7 is word - representable .",
    "suppose the graph is colored with @xmath210 natural numbers .",
    "orient the edges of the graph from smaller to larger colors .",
    "there is no directed path with more than @xmath211 arcs , but since @xmath7 contains no cycle of @xmath210 or fewer edges , there can be no shortcut . hence , the digraph is semi - transitive .",
    "the next theorem shows us how to construct an infinite series of triangle - free non - word - representable graphs .",
    "this answers an open question in @xcite .",
    "[ anti - t1_2 ] there exist triangle - free non - word - representable graphs .",
    "let @xmath82 be a 4-chromatic graph with girth at least 10 ( such graphs exist by erds theorem ) .",
    "for every path @xmath80 of length 3 in @xmath82 add to @xmath82 the edge @xmath212 connecting its ends .",
    "denote the obtained graph by @xmath7 .",
    "let us show that @xmath7 is a triangle - free non - word - representable graph .",
    "if @xmath7 contains a triangle on the vertices @xmath213 then @xmath82 contains three paths @xmath214 and @xmath215 of lengths 1 or 3 connecting these vertices .",
    "let @xmath109 be a graph spanned by these three paths .",
    "since @xmath109 has at most 9 edges and the girth of @xmath82 is at least 10 , @xmath109 is a tree . clearly , it can not be a path .",
    "so , it is a subdivision of @xmath216 with the leafs @xmath213 .",
    "but then at least one of the paths @xmath217 must have an even length , a contradiction .",
    "so , @xmath7 is triangle - free .",
    "assume that @xmath7 has a semi - transitive orientation .",
    "then it induces a semi - transitive orientation on @xmath82 .",
    "since @xmath82 is 4-chromatic , each of its acyclic orientation must contain a directed path @xmath80 of length at least 3 .",
    "but then the orientation of the edge @xmath212 in @xmath7 produces either a 4-cycle or a shortcut , contradicting the semi - transitivity .",
    "so , @xmath7 is a triangle - free non - word - representable graph .",
    "what about other non - word - representable graphs ? or , rather , which",
    "important classes of graphs are not contained in the class of word - representable graphs ?",
    "we establish the following classes to be not necessarily word - representable graphs :    * chordal ( see the rightmost graph in fig .  [ small ] ) , and thus perfect , * line ( second graph in fig .  [ small ] ) , * co - trees ( the graph co-@xmath218 earlier ) , and thus co - bipartite and co - comparability , * 2-outerplanar ( the first and last graphs in fig .  [ small ] ) , and thus planar * split ( the last graph in fig .",
    "[ small ] ) , * 3-trees ( the last graph in fig .  [ small ] ) , and thus partial 3-trees .    on the other hand , the 4-clique , @xmath15 , is a word - representable graphs and it belongs to all these classes .",
    "it is natural to ask about optimization problems on word - representable graphs .",
    "the known np - hardness of many classical optimization problems on 3-colorable graphs implies np - hardness on word - representable graphs , due to theorem  [ obs:3col ] .",
    "the optimization problems independent set , dominating set , graph coloring , clique partition , clique covering are np - hard on word - representable graphs .",
    "note that it may be relevant whether the representation of the graph as a semi - transitive digraph is given ; solvability under these conditions is open .",
    "however , some problems remain polynomially solvable :    the height of a digraph is the length of its longest path .",
    "it is natural to ask for orientations of small height , which may have various practical applications .",
    "the minimum height of a digraph is equivalent to the chromatic number of the underlying graph .",
    "hence , it is np - complete to determine whether a word - representable graph corresponds to a digraph of height 3 .",
    "let @xmath219 be the set of sources in the digraph @xmath78 and let @xmath220 be the digraph obtained by removing the sources @xmath219 .",
    "clearly , @xmath219 is an independent set in the graph .",
    "further , note that the height of @xmath78 is one greater than the height of @xmath220 .",
    "it can not be more , since @xmath219 is independent , but any path of length @xmath157 in @xmath220 extends to a longer path in @xmath78 starting from one of the sources .",
    "hence , a height @xmath157 digraph is @xmath157-colorable .",
    "the converse is also easy to verify .",
    "two of open problems stated in the preliminary version of this paper  @xcite were solved .",
    "one of the solved problems is on np - hardness of the problem of recognition whether a given graph is word - representable or not , and it is discussed in section  [ nice ] ( see corollary  [ cor : innp ] ) .",
    "the other problem was solved in  @xcite , where it was shown that there exist non - word - representable graphs of maximum degree 4 .",
    "we end up the paper with stating revised versions of the remaining two open problems .    1 .",
