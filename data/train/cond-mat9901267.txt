    "the dynamics of systems close to a glass transition remains a central problem in statistical physics @xcite . because the glass transition is a many - body phenomenon , models for it invariably involve some approximation and it is important to disentangle the physical phenomena from the approximation scheme used . in mode - coupling theories , for example ,",
    "the dynamics are dominated by a small number of collective degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "this is appealing , but ignores activated processes , and obscures the fact that glassy materials are dynamically heterogeneous with a variety of local environments @xcite .",
    "another approach is to use disordered hopping models , which treat instead single - particle degrees of freedom coupled to a random environment , and this is the route followed here . such models , though unrealistic in some respects , are likely to give a better account of those properties , such as self - diffusion , which are not dominated by relaxation of collective modes .",
    "an important breakthrough in the approach based on hopping models was that of bouchaud @xcite , who showed that an ensemble of _ non - interacting _ particles , moving by thermally activated hopping at temperature @xmath0 in an uncorrelated fashion through a sequence of traps , can show a glass transition .",
    "this occurs if and only if the density of states ( the prior probability distribution of trap depths ) @xmath1 has an exponential tail .",
    "though grossly over - simplified , this allows many properties of the model to be calculated exactly .",
    "the exponential tail to the prior distribution @xmath1 , which leads to a power - law spectrum of relaxation times and is vital to the appearance of a glass transition , is supported by evidence from theory on spin glasses @xcite and experiments on low - temperature fluids @xcite .",
    "such a power - law relaxation spectrum was the point of departure for a related model of glasses @xcite , and similar features appear in models of dispersive transport in disordered semiconductors @xcite .",
    "the original model of bouchaud has no explicit spatial coordinates .",
    "nevertheless , the extension to self - diffusion is unambiguous ( if each hop corresponds to a spatial displacement with a well - defined second moment ) and indeed monthus and bouchaud @xcite gave an expression for the distribution of displacements on a hypercubic lattice . for flow properties , more choices",
    "are possible in the way spatial coordinates are treated , but a minimal extension of the model was offered by sollich et al .",
    "this model , which we call the gr ( glassy rheology ) model allows both linear and nonlinear rheological properties to be calculated .",
    "details of it are recalled in section [ gr ] below .    the model introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite was in fact proposed to describe a class of  soft glassy materials \" ( argued to include foams , dense emulsions , etc . ) , in which context it was found necessary to replace the thermodynamic temperature @xmath0 in bouchaud s model by an effective ( noise ) temperature @xmath2 .",
    "this replacement converts the gr model studied below into the _ soft _ glassy rheology model of refs .",
    "@xcite , and can be made throughout our calculations .",
    "the glass transition in the gr model shows interesting features which may need further explanation for readers whose background lies in conventional glasses .",
    "specifically , in bouchaud s model the glass transition @xmath3 is identified as the temperature below which the system shows  weak ergodicity breaking \" : its boltzmann distribution is not normalizable .",
    "this means the system will evolve into deeper and deeper traps as time goes by , and will never attain a steady state  although at no finite time are there infinite barriers partitioning phase space .",
    "when flow - related degrees of freedom are included in the model ( see section [ gr ] below ) , one finds , as expected , that the system has a finite elastic modulus ( at zero frequency ) for temperatures @xmath4 .",
    "less obviously , the _ viscosity _ of the material diverges , not at @xmath5 but at @xmath6 . between these two temperatures ,",
    "the static modulus is zero but the viscosity infinite ; the material is what is known in rheological language as a  power - law fluid \" . for applications of the model to soft glassy materials",
    "this is a very attractive feature , since such viscoelastic behaviour is frequently observed in these systems @xcite . in a model of conventional glasses , on the other hand , it might be considered undesirable . however , with the introduction of a high energy cutoff in the prior distribution @xmath1 , the phenomenology of the gr model can be adapted to model that of conventional glasses .",
    "we discuss the conceptual features of this modification at the end of section [ concl ] ; for the actual calculations in the present paper we restrict ourselves to the simpler case without cutoff .    below we calculate the statistics ( additional to the results of ref .",
    "@xcite ) of self - diffusion in the gr model , and explore quantitatively the breakdown , near the glass transition , of the ( generalized ) stokes - einstein relation [ ( g)ser ] between self - diffusion of a representative particle in the fluid and the ( frequency - dependent ) viscosity of the system as a whole .",
    "( this breakdown does not , of course , imply that gser also fails for _ macroscopic _ probe particles which see the surrounding material as a continuum . )",
    "we also investigate the effect of shear flow on self - diffusion and show that this causes a finite diffusivity in the low - temperature regime where this was previously zero .    in the next section we review the status of the gser in both conventional and soft glassy systems .",
    "the gr model is described in section [ gr ] and used in section [ test ] to study and discuss the breakdown of the gser . in section",
    "[ analysis ] , we further elucidate the physics of particle transport in glassy systems , using both analysis and simulation of the model . in section [ shear ]",
    "we calculate the effects of shear on the rate of self - diffusion , finding the diffusion constant in the presence of continuous and periodic shear strains of various rates and amplitudes . in section [ concl ]",
    "we conclude with a discussion of our results in the context of both conventional super - cooled / glass - forming liquids and soft glassy materials .",
    "the stokes - einstein relation ( ser ) between coefficients of diffusion and viscosity ( and its generalization to frequency - dependent quantities ) is of great importance to our understanding of transport in fluids .",
    "this is especially true since the development of new techniques to measure viscoelastic response by light scattering from ( or tracking of ) probe particles @xcite . yet",
    "the relation s range of validity has been called into question by experiments on super - cooled and glass - forming liquids @xcite .    to find the linear storage and loss moduli , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , of a viscoelastic fluid",
    ", a rheometer is normally used to apply an oscillatory stress to the fluid and measure the resultant strain ( or _ vice versa _ ) as a function of ( angular ) frequency @xmath9 .",
    "a technique has recently been developed whereby the complex viscoelastic modulus @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) may be found is the fourier transform of the time derivative of the stress relaxation modulus @xmath12 , which relates stress on the fluid , @xmath13 , to strain rate @xmath14 . ] , even when the available sample of fluid is too small to fill a rheometer .",
    "the technique involves introducing one or more neutrally buoyant probe spheres of radius @xmath15 into the fluid and measuring their brownian motion . for a newtonian fluid , which is characterized by a single , frequency - independent viscosity @xmath16 , that viscosity is given by the familiar stokes - einstein formula @xmath17 . here",
    "@xmath18 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath0 temperature .",
    "as the fluid is newtonian , the probe executes an unbiased random walk , and its mean - square displacement as a function of time is @xmath19 , which defines the diffusion constant @xmath20 appearing in the stokes - einstein formula . in this purely viscous fluid ,",
    "@xmath10 is purely imaginary , given by @xmath21 .",
    "as the derivative of the stress relaxation modulus is a well - behaved function of time , its laplace transform @xmath22 is simply related to its fourier transform @xmath23 . combining the above expressions",
    ", we see that probe spheres _ in a newtonian fluid _ respect the relation @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the laplace transform of the mean - square displacement of a probe .",
    "equation [ gser ] says that the modulus of a viscoelastic fluid is the ratio of a driving force ( in this case induced by @xmath26 rather than by a rheometer ) to a response ( mean - square distance moved by the sphere ) .    although derived above only for the newtonian case , eq .",
    "[ gser ] is the generalized stokes - einstein relation ( gser ) , and when written in this form it applies under relatively general conditions to _ all linearly viscoelastic fluids _ , not just newtonian ones @xcite .",
    "the basic stokes - einstein relation ( ser ) is recovered from eq .",
    "[ gser ] in the zero frequency limit , since viscosity is _ defined _ by @xmath27 . in all cases , the fluid around the probe is treated as a featureless continuum , and therefore the result is only valid when the sphere radius greatly exceeds the microscopic length scale ( _ e.g_.  particle size ) of the fluid .",
    "( furthermore , probe particles must be sufficiently dilute to ensure independent stokesian flow fields around each . )",
    "if , as is sometimes the case , the gser is applied to probe particles which are not large compared to the microscopic scale , then it ceases to be a rigorous result . as an approximation ,",
    "it is then close to the spirit of effective medium theory ( wherein a representative particle is viewed as embedded in a continuum and its contribution to the continuum properties then calculated self - consistently ) .    with macroscopic probe particles ,",
    "the gser has been fruitfully employed @xcite to measure the rheological properties of viscoelastic fluids from light scattering or optical tracking observations of the suspended probes . in ref.@xcite , mason and weitz",
    "applied this method successfully to various systems , using colloidal spheres as probes .",
    "remarkably , in one case the medium analysed was itself a suspension of the colloidal particles , of volume fraction @xmath28 , which lies close to the glass transition concentration .",
    "the scattering method used was diffusion - wave spectroscopy ( dws ) @xcite whose direct interpretation in terms of self - diffusion is somewhat ambiguous ; but in any case , both criteria for the rigorous validity of the gser were violated ( no separation of length scales , and probe particles not dilute ) . yet the diffusion data for this system , analysed as though dws was probing self - diffusion and transformed into putative rheological data via the gser , compare remarkably well with frequency - dependent rheological data measured directly . among various explanations that are possible for this , is the idea that the gser is in fact more widely valid than generally assumed @xcite .    on the other hand , in conventional glass - forming fluids , the ( zero - frequency ) tracer diffusion and viscosity have been measured as a function of temperature , by experiment @xcite and simulation @xcite . while the ser held ( within a factor of order unity ) for probes just a few times larger than the fluid particles @xcite , for equal - size probes the translational diffusion was enhanced by orders of magnitude with respect to the ser prediction as the glass transition was approached .",
    "in view of the unexpected success of gser for colloidal glassy fluids , alongside the failure of ser for conventional glasses , a more detailed examination of the connection between diffusion and rheology seems worthwhile , and we pursue this in what follows .",
    "we use a simple hopping model to emulate properties of a fluid close to its glass transition . the model , which will be referred to as the ` glassy rheology ' ( gr ) model ,",
    "was defined in ref .",
    "@xcite , where its response to a macroscopic shear was calculated . in the present study we shall investigate the relation between rheology and particle transport in the gr model .      the gr model is based on bouchaud s model for glassy dynamics @xcite , with the addition of shear strain degrees of freedom which that model lacks .",
    "particles in the bouchaud model are thermally activated at temperature @xmath29 from traps of energetic depth @xmath30 in a time @xmath31 which has an exponential distribution with rate @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is some microscopic rate constant .",
    "having escaped , a particle selects its next trap _ at random _ ( _ i.e .",
    "_ there are no spatial correlations ) from the _ prior distribution _ of trap depths @xmath1 .",
    "we briefly recall the resulting behaviour of bouchaud s model . for high temperatures",
    "@xmath0 , the occupancy of traps of depth @xmath30 evolves towards the boltzmann distribution @xmath34 .",
    "as @xmath0 is lowered , this distribution may cease to be normalizable , leading to a glass transition at @xmath35 . for @xmath36 ,",
    "no equilibrium state exists , and the system shows `` weak ergodicity breaking '' and various ageing phenomena .",
    "a finite value of @xmath37 implies an exponential tail in the density of states , @xmath38 .",
    "the gr model ascribes some internal features to the traps .",
    "this is done through a minimalist description in which the tensorial aspects of the problem are ignored and the shear rate and strain are treated as though they were scalar quantities @xcite .",
    "the trap s potential is taken to be quadratic in a local strain ( or relative displacement ) coordinate @xmath39 , so that the particle s energy is @xmath40 , with @xmath41 a constant .",
    "this applies up to a local yield value @xmath42 , whose energy @xmath43 is the depth of the trap . upon reaching this threshold",
    ", the system locally rearranges to a new configuration , thus relaxing the local strain @xmath42 .",
    "the yield energy of the new potential well is drawn from the prior distribution @xmath1 , and its strain @xmath39 set to zero . in the absence of an externally imposed shear rate @xmath44 , all @xmath39 values remain zero , and the gr model reduces to the bouchaud model , with hopping between traps caused by thermal activation alone .",
    "with shear imposed , changes in all local strains are assumed to follow the global strain rate , @xmath45 .",
    "( this assumption is mean - field in character . ) with the particles thus dragged up their quadratic energy wells by global shear , the barrier to thermal activation is reduced , and the local yield rate becomes @xmath46 $ ] . if @xmath47 is the probability of finding an occupied trap of given @xmath39 and @xmath30 , the above dynamics imply @xcite @xmath48 the first term on the r.h.s . arises from local straining by the macroscopic deformation .",
    "the second describes the loss of occupied traps from the distribution by thermally activated yielding .",
    "the last term corresponds to creation of new , unstrained configurations , whose trap depth is drawn from the prior @xmath1 , at a rate equal to the total yield rate in the system , @xmath49\\right\\rangle_p$ ] .",
    "note that , as originally conceived in the context of soft glassy materials @xcite each occupied trap represented a small region of the medium , large enough for a local shear strain @xmath39 to be defined , but small enough for this to be approximately uniform within the region .",
    "however , the model can readily be interpreted as describing the motion of individual particles in a conventional super - cooled / glass - forming fluid , by associating the local strain @xmath39 with , say , the relative displacement of a particle from the centre of a trap formed by its neighbours .",
    "we have not yet defined the stress in the gr model . due to stochastic yielding events ,",
    "the local stress , which we take to be @xmath50 , is inhomogeneous ( it follows the local strain @xmath39 , rather than the macroscopic strain ) .",
    "since we have stated that the strain rate @xmath51 is everywhere equal to the global strain rate @xmath44 , these local stresses must combine according to a straightforward average so that @xmath52 . as discussed in section [ breakdown ] , this corresponds to a fully parallel mechanical circuit ; this is the only combination consistent with affine shear , and may well be approached in many physical systems .",
    "the dynamics described ( eq .  [ eom ] ) are further motivated in refs.@xcite , where the gr model s constitutive relation between stress and strain rate is calculated .",
    "we now briefly summarize the linear rheology that the model predicts .",
    "we use non - dimensional units for time and energy by setting @xmath53 ; we also re - scale our strain variables ( @xmath54 ) and stress @xmath55 so that @xmath56 .",
    "the complex dynamic shear modulus @xmath57 describes the stress response to small shear strain perturbations around the equilibrium state . as such ,",
    "it is well defined ( _ i.e .  _ time - independent ) only above the glass transition , @xmath58 .",
    "expanding eq .",
    "( [ eom ] ) to first order in the amplitude @xmath59 of an oscillatory strain @xmath60 , we find @xmath61 where the average is taken with respect to occupied traps , and @xmath62 is the mean ( arrhenius ) residence time for a trap of depth @xmath30 .",
    "( we distinguish this from the actual residence time @xmath31 in such a trap , which is a random variable . )",
    "equation [ grresult ] corresponds to a distribution of maxwell modes whose spectrum of relaxation times is given by the equilibrium distribution @xmath63 .",
    "given that @xmath1 has an exponential tail ( required for @xmath64 to be finite ) , the distribution of residence times thus exhibits power - law behaviour for large @xmath31 : @xmath65 .",
    "this leads to power laws , which may be apparent in conventional glasses , maxwellian behaviour re - appears at low @xmath9 .",
    "see section [ concl ] . ] for @xmath10 in the low frequency range : @xmath66 for @xmath67 the system is maxwell - like at low frequencies , whereas for @xmath68 there is an anomalous power law in the elastic modulus .",
    "most interesting is the regime @xmath69 , where @xmath70 and @xmath71 have constant ratio ; both vary as @xmath72 .",
    "moreover , the frequency exponent approaches zero as @xmath73 , resulting in essentially constant values of @xmath71 and @xmath70 .",
    "note , however , that the ratio @xmath74 becomes small as the glass transition is approached .",
    "this increasing dominance of the elastic response @xmath70 prefigures the onset of a yield stress for @xmath75  @xcite .",
    "however , for @xmath75 the linear viscoelastic moduli show slow time evolution and ageing effects @xcite in accordance with the weak ergodicity breaking discussed in section [ introd ] . accordingly , in the following section , where the gser for this model is discussed , we consider only @xmath76 .",
    "however , that does include the regime @xmath77 which would lie below the  glass transition temperature \" were this to be defined operationally by the divergence of the viscosity .",
    "as @xmath64 is approached from above , the equilibration time following a quick quench diverges .",
    "hence , even for @xmath78 , non - equilibrium situations are also of interest in glass - forming materials , though we shall consider only equilibrium situations in the following section .    in order to study self - diffusion @xcite , we must clarify further the spatial interpretation of our gr model .",
    "we shall associate each relaxation event with a step on an unbiased random walk .",
    "we draw each step from a gaussian of unit variance in each spatial direction ( thus defining a length unit for the model ) .",
    "this gives a meaning to the square displacement , @xmath79 .",
    "after each step , the randomly walking particle is temporarily trapped within a potential well .",
    "within each well , we assume rapid ` thermalization ' of the particle , which therefore samples a gaussian distribution of displacements at each site on the walk .",
    "in fact , we assume this thermalization to be instantaneous , thus discarding information about high frequency intra - well dynamics .",
    "hence , we model the time regime of @xmath80-relaxation , but not of @xmath81-relaxation .",
    "we have the complex linear viscoelastic modulus for the gr model , quoted in the section above .",
    "it is now our task to compare this with the prediction of the gser , applied to a probe particle which is representative of the fluid itself .",
    "the result of eq .",
    "[ gser ] , whose validity is in doubt for a small probe of this kind , will be denoted @xmath82 .",
    "calculating @xmath82 from eq .",
    "[ gser ] requires a knowledge of @xmath25 in the equilibrium fluid .",
    "the brackets @xmath83 denote an average over all random walks of the particles , in terms of choice of path and of trap depths drawn from the prior distribution @xmath1 . in the absence of intra - well structure",
    ", the treatment of continuous - time random walks is discussed in refs.@xcite .",
    "the mean - square displacement can be found from the correlation function @xmath84 , defined by @xmath85 .",
    "this is calculable @xcite via @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the probability of having performed exactly @xmath88 hops at time @xmath89 , and @xmath90 is the fourier transform of the positional probability distribution after an @xmath88-step random walk . as described in section [ gr ] , the positional distribution is the convolution of a standard random walk and a ",
    "gaussian of thermalization \" ( whose variance is @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the local spring constant , and @xmath93 the dimension of space ) .",
    "so its fourier transform @xmath90 is the _ product _ of the usual function @xmath94 and another gaussian .",
    "the quantity @xmath87 depends only on the distribution of residence times .",
    "note that the time between hops along a random walk is drawn from the distribution @xmath95 , which is _ not _ the distribution of residence times of occupied states in the system , @xmath96 .",
    "the former distribution gives the inter - hop times _ available _ to a random walker upon selecting its next trap .",
    "the latter gives the residence times of all the states in the system which are _ presently occupied_. thus @xmath96 is related to @xmath95 by a weight factor @xmath31 , since the likelihood of finding a given trap occupied is proportional to the time for which it is occupied : @xmath97 accordingly , averages of some stochastic quantity @xmath98 with respect to the two distributions are related by @xmath99 in terms of a typical random walk , @xmath100 is the average with respect to the steps , while @xmath101 is the average with respect to time .",
    "note that , in calculating the probability @xmath87 of having performed @xmath88 hops at time @xmath89 , the time spent in each trap is drawn from @xmath102 _ except for the first trap _",
    "@xcite , which is selected from @xmath96 .",
    "this reflects the fact that the walker is not introduced to the system at time zero , but is selected at random from the traps already occupied .",
    "this careful choice of the first trap is important to the diffusive behaviour at early times @xcite and , as we shall see , its influence persists for increasingly long times as the glass transition is approached .    from the definition of @xmath103 it follows that , in terms of its temporal laplace transform @xmath104 , @xmath105 where @xmath106 denotes a derivative in @xmath107-space . from this prescription",
    ", we find @xmath108 here , @xmath109 is the laplace transform of @xmath110 .",
    "the distribution of available escape times @xmath95 is given by averaging the exponential distribution for a single trap over the prior energy distribution @xmath1 thus : @xmath111.\\ ] ] so its laplace transform is @xmath112 with @xmath113 the mean residence time for trap depth @xmath30 .",
    "the expression for @xmath114 is the same , with the average over hops replaced by an average over occupied traps .",
    "so , from eq.[averages ] , @xmath115 substituting this expression into eq .",
    "[ r2s ] cancels the @xmath116-dependence .",
    "so we see that the second moment of the distribution of displacements , @xmath117 is independent of any properties of the distribution of trapping times except for its mean .",

    "_ for all )",
    ". clearly , this expression is completely at odds with the actual rheology of the gr model as described in section [ gr ] .",
    "the generalized stokes - einstein relation , when applied to a small probe , has failed in two distinct ways which we now discuss .",
    "the first is a ( fairly trivial ) discrepancy in the temperature dependence , which is inherent in any hopping model . to study the spurious @xmath0-dependence of the characteristic time in eq .",
    "[ wrong ] , let us take the inverse laplace transform of eq .",
    "thus we find the nature of the probe s diffusive motion as a function of time : @xmath121 the time - independent term @xmath122 is the variance of the local ` gaussian of thermalization ' in which the probe finds itself at each step of its walk , and respects equipartition of energy amongst the elastic degrees of freedom .",
    "the second term says that diffusion is exactly linear on all time scales is equivalent to the infinite - dimensional limit of the exact result for a random trap model on a hyper - cubic lattice obtained by schroeder @xcite and kehr et al .",
    "@xcite . ] , with a diffusion constant @xmath123 the gser implies that the mean - square speed ( also given by equipartition , @xmath124 ) sets the rate of translation along the random walk .",
    "indeed this is why the diffusion constant is proportional to temperature in dilute gases , where particles are not caged , so their directions rapidly become decorrelated . like any activated hopping process @xcite with a temperature - independent microscopic attempt rate ( _ e.g .  _ the eyring model of dense fluids @xcite ) , the gr model lacks such a factor @xmath0 in the diffusion constant ( eq .",
    "this is the source of the rogue @xmath0-dependence of @xmath125 .",

    "[ grresult ] . in a maxwellian fluid ,",
    "the distribution of lifetimes is narrow , since there is a single characteristic relaxation time .",
    "thermal averaging then commutes with the other algebraic operations , so the incorrect placement of the thermal brackets becomes irrelevant in that case .",

    "effective - medium theories , and also simple forms of mode - coupling theory @xcite ( in which a single mode of slow relaxation dominates ) can give misleading predictions under these conditions .",
    "for glassy systems , use of the gser will under - predict the diffusivity of particles and/or the rheological viscoelastic moduli .",
    "this is because the latter are dominated by the most immobile and the former is dominated by the most mobile particles .",
    "in fact , the nature of diffusion in the model is quite subtle ( see section [ analysis ] ) : close to ( but above ) the glass transition one has an apparently bimodal behaviour .",
    "starting from any initial equilibrium state , a fraction of particles remain stuck for a long time , but any particle that has hopped once remains mobile thereafter .",
    "it is peculiar that , despite this , the diffusive behaviour conspires to be relatively normal ( at least for low order moments of the displacement distribution ; moments of fractional negative order would presumably reveal a different story ) .",
    "an additional peculiarity of diffusion , which our model does not include , but which could also lead to enhanced diffusivity near the glass temperature , has been observed in a recent molecular dynamics simulation @xcite . in ref.@xcite the effective dimensionality of the most mobile random walks",
    "was observed to decrease with temperature . at low temperature , particles moved along string - like clusters ( also seen in ref .",

    "we have also applied our gr model to calculate the change in the self - diffusion constant when a material is sheared .",
    "after subtraction of affine motion ( including taylor dispersion ) @xcite , or equivalently restricting attention to diffusion perpendicular to the shear direction , one finds a strong effect of imposed flow on the mean jump rate @xcite and hence on the diffusion constant .",
    "the effect is particularly extreme below the glass transition , where an anomalous ( sub - diffusive ) behaviour is converted to a finite diffusivity which has , instead , a power law dependence on the steady shear rate .",
    "such effects should be accessible in scattering experiments ( with wavevector almost perpendicular to the flow direction ) on labelled small probes . in oscillatory shear , an enhancement in @xmath20 was predicted in section [ shear ] for systems above ( but near ) the glass temperature ; this could also be probed via scattering .",
    "the gr model as described in section [ gr ] was originally developed in ref .",
    "@xcite to reproduce the generic rheology of a class of  soft glassy materials \" .",
    "( we comment further below on its relevance to conventional glasses . )",
    "this class was argued to include , for example , foams , emulsions , pastes and slurries .",
    "experimentally , their linear viscoelastic behaviour is often characterized by a nearly constant ratio of the elastic and loss moduli @xmath7 , @xmath8 ( @xmath252 is usually about 0.1 ) with a frequency dependence that is either a weak power law ( clay slurries , paints , microgels ) or negligible ( tomato paste , dense emulsions , dense multi - layer vesicles ) @xcite .",
    "this behaviour persists down to the lowest experimentally accessible frequencies .",
    "sometimes a regime is seen at small @xmath9 where @xmath70 is constant and @xmath71 is decreasing ( which can be interpreted in terms of the model s behaviour below @xmath3 @xcite ) .    as mentioned in sections [ introd ] and [ gr ] ,",
    "there are two differences between the gr model used in this paper and its soft counterpart in @xcite .",
    "the first is that the _ soft _ gr model refers not to particles , as we have done , but to mesoscopic material  elements \" , large enough for a local elastic strain variable to be defined but small enough to have strong heterogeneity in local yield energies .",
    "( for the case of a foam , say , an  element \" could correspond to a domain of several bubbles , and  yield \" to a local topological change . ) it is not necessarily clear what is meant by self - diffusion of such elements , so in the present paper we have retained a particle picture , although this is more natural for conventional glass - forming liquids than for soft glassy materials .",
    "the second difference is that in the _ soft _ gr model , @xmath0 is replaced by an effective  noise temperature \" @xmath253 .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that the resemblance to thermal activation is formal : the  activated \" yield processes are viewed as arising primarily by coupling to structural rearrangements elsewhere in the system .",
    "indeed , the elastic energies associated with local rearrangements in foams and the like are many orders of magnitude in excess of @xmath26 , so any interpretation of @xmath253 as a true temperature is somewhat unconvincing for these materials ( in contrast to conventional glasses ) .",
    "although this interpretation remains problematical , as discussed in @xcite , with it the soft gr model is able to reproduce many of the rheological properties of soft glassy materials .",
    "the results we have obtained for the gr model , concerning breakdown of the gser and the nature of shear - induced diffusion , equally apply ( with @xmath254 ) to the _ soft _ gr model .",
    "the breakdown of gser , arising from the fact that diffusion and rheology probe different aspects of the relaxation spectrum , is equally natural in this case ; the other contribution to its breakdown discussed in [ breakdown ] , arising from the temperature dependence of the local attempt frequency , even more so ( since @xmath253 is anyway not a true temperature ) .",
    "the results of section [ shear ] for shear - induced diffusion could also be quite interesting for soft glassy materials , in which it is easy to apply shear strains large enough to strongly perturb the intrinsic relaxation times .",
    "the length scales in these materials can be probed via light scattering ; index matching is often possible so that true tracer diffusion ( of a small subset of unmatched droplets or particles ) can be measured @xcite . for oscillatory flows ,",
    "an important innovation is the echo technique @xcite in which the positions of a given scatter at identical points in the shear cycle are compared .",
    "results on dense emulsions @xcite suggest , in fact , that not only are shear - induced reorganizations easily detectable , but that these have strong temporal and spatial correlations  regions that reorganize at a given point in the shear cycle will do so again in the next one .",
    "such correlations are not included in the ( soft ) gr model(s ) although they might be added in principle @xcite .",
    "( it would require escape from a shallow trap to be preferentially into another shallow trap , though we do not advocate appending such ad - hoc correlations to this simplified model . )",
    "it would be very interesting to know whether the same applies in conventional glasses ; preliminary work on colloidal suspensions ( which are traditionally thought of in these terms ) suggests not @xcite .",
    "finally , we return to the phenomenology of the gr model in relation to conventional glass - forming liquids . as explained in section [ gr]b , the gr model in its basic form",
    "predicts a viscosity divergence at @xmath128 , while the diffusion constant vanishes only at @xmath149 , where the system has a glass transition to a non - ergodic state .",
    "this existence of a temperature range with finite diffusivity but infinite viscosity appears to be at odds with the experimentally observed behaviour of conventional glasses .",
    "a common divergence of viscosity and inverse diffusion constant can however be incorporated into the gr model through a cutoff @xmath255 on the distribution of yield energies @xmath1 ; this modification of the model has in fact already been discussed in ref .",
    "it yields a viscosity which initially follows the original power - law divergence as @xmath128 is approached , but then crosses over to @xmath256 as @xmath0 is lowered further .",
    "similarly , the predicted @xmath257 would first seem to diverge as @xmath149 is approached from above , but actually remain finite there and eventually approach infinity at the same temperature as the viscosity ( @xmath258 ) .",
    "the shear moduli obey the power laws ( eq .",
    "[ powerlaws ] ) down to a cutoff frequency @xmath259 , but then cross over to low - frequency maxwell behaviour ( @xmath260 , @xmath261 ) .",
    "the above simple temperature dependences apply if , as we did throughout , we assume that the ( prior ) density of yield energies is temperature independent .",
    "this is of course an approximation ; odagaki , for example , suggested that the width of @xmath1 may in fact scale as the inverse of the amount of free volume @xmath262 in the system @xcite .",
    "in all temperature dependences , @xmath263 then replaces @xmath0 . as a consequence ,",
    "if the free volume decreases smoothly to zero at a finite temperature @xmath264 , a vogel - fulcher - like divergence of @xmath16 and @xmath257 at @xmath264 ( rather than the above arrhenius behaviour ) would be predicted by the gr model with energy cutoff .",
    "one would then be inclined to locate the glass transition at that point ; if we revert to temperature independent @xmath1 , this corresponds to @xmath258 ( rather than @xmath149 , which is the appropriate choice in the absence of an energy cutoff ) .",

    "<S> this stems from the presence of a broad distribution of relaxation times of which different moments control diffusion and rheology . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the effect of flow ( oscillatory shear ) on self - diffusion and show that this causes a finite diffusivity in the temperature regime below the glass transition ( where this was previously zero ) . at higher temperatures the diffusivity is enhanced by a power law frequency dependence that also characterises the rheological response . </S>",
