    "ultra - stable lasers @xcite are essential in high - resolution laser spectroscopy @xcite , optical frequency standards @xcite , gravitational wave detection @xcite , and fundamental tests of physics @xcite . to achieve such a frequency stabilized local oscillator , the laser is typically servo locked to a high - finesse reference cavity by using pound - drever - hall ( pdh ) technique @xcite . within the servo locking bandwidth ,",
    "the stability of the locked laser is determined by the stability of the optical path - length of the reference cavity . at low frequencies ( below 100 hz )",
    "the most severe fluctuations of the cavity length are caused by environmental disturbances such as seismic and acoustic noise . at higher frequencies",
    "these disturbances are usually damped by active vibration isolation .",
    "it can be shown that the sensitivity of the reference cavity to the low frequency environmental disturbances can be minimized by optimizing cavity geometry and mounting method @xcite .",
    "while the sensitivity of a reference cavity to mechanical vibrations can be suppressed such that the influence of these perturbations can be ignored , there still exists a fundamental thermal noise limit to the level of stability achievable with the reference cavity @xcite .",
    "this limit is attributed to brownian motion of the reference cavity spacer , mirror substrates , and optical coatings @xcite . as have been widely reported before @xcite , using short length cavities ( @xmath22 cm ) constructed entirely from ule glass , the relative frequency stability characterized by allan deviation",
    "was limited by thermal noise to the level of @xmath23 .",
    "several methods can be used to lower the thermal noise limit , such as increasing the reference cavity spacer length , increasing the laser spot size , and using high mechanical @xmath24 materials . of these methods , using high @xmath24 materials offer the biggest improvements .    to lower the thermal noise limit of reference cavities , a commonly used high @xmath24 material is fused silica ( fs ) .",
    "because fs has a much larger coefficient of thermal expansion ( cte ) ( @xmath25 ppb / k ) than that of ule ( @xmath26 ppb / k ) @xcite , it is not appropriate to use fs as cavity spacer material . since the dominant thermal noise contribution comes from the mirror substrates , it would be more suitable to just use fs as mirror substrates , and keep ule as cavity spacer material .",
    "replacing the ule mirrors of a short ule cavity by fs mirrors can lower the thermal noise limit approximately by a factor of two @xcite . combining with a longer length cavity spacer , it is then possible to reach a thermal noise limit of @xmath21 .",
    "however , the cte mismatch between fs and ule can cause a problem .",
    "temperature changes inside the reference cavity can create stress which bends the mirror substrates , and introduces a larger effective cte for the composite cavity .",
    "this problem can be alleviated by setting the operating temperature of the reference cavity at the zero crossing temperature of the effective cte .",
    "if a ule spacer has its zero crossing temperature of cte at room temperature , then the zero crossing temperature of the effective cte will be much lower . however , this is not very convenient , because cooling a reference cavity is technically more challenging than simply heating the reference cavity .",
    "if the temperature is set too low , it can introduce extra problems , like water condensation on cavity housing , _ etc .",
    "_ for practical purpose , it is preferable to stabilize the reference cavity temperature a little bit above room temperature .",
    "presently there are several approaches to achieve this objective .",
    "one is to find a ule piece that has negative cte at room temperature , and in combination with positive cte of fs , it is possible to make the zero crossing temperature of the effective cte to be above room temperature @xcite .",
    "another method is to contact ule rings to the back side of fs mirrors to prevent the mirror bending due to cte mismatch @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", the zero crossing temperature of the effective cte can be above room temperature .",
    "both methods are used by jiang _",
    "et al . _ , and a fractional frequency instability of @xmath27 was achieved @xcite .",
    "the above two approaches have their limitations .",
    "the first approach relies on the availability of ule material with negative cte at room temperature .",
    "this requires the good will of the ule manufacturer , and might not be always available . the second approach in principle",
    "can be used to tune the zero crossing temperature over a range of about 30 @xmath28c , but it only works for a smaller diameter ule spacer @xcite . to lower the thermal noise of the reference cavity , it is common to choose a longer cavity length with bigger diameter .",
    "the tuning range then is limited to only about @xmath29 @xmath28c for this geometry according to our calculations .",
    "normal ule has the zero crossing temperature of cte varying between 5 @xmath30c and 35 @xmath30c @xcite , so with this limited tuning range it is not always possible to raise the zero crossing temperature of the effective cte to above room temperature .    another approach is to use a re - entrant mirror design for the reference cavity @xcite . by using a re - entrant mirror design ,",
    "the direction of fs mirror thermal expansion is opposite to that of ule spacer , so in principle they can be compensated better , and introduce less stress to the mirrors . in reality the tuning range of the zero crossing temperature difference is about 20 @xmath30c @xmath31 30 @xmath30c .",
    "consequently , this cavity design is only suitable for cases when ule spacers have a zero crossing temperature lower than 5 @xmath30c . in this paper , we analyze a modified re - entrant mirror design for the reference cavity , where the ule rings for the re - entrant fs mirrors are replaced with fs rings . with this design modification ,",
    "the zero crossing temperature of the effective cte can be tuned to much greater range , and it is very easy to design a composite cavity so that the zero crossing temperature of the effective cte is above room temperature .    since a low thermal noise reference cavity design is central to this paper , a detailed discussion of the thermal noise limit of a ule cavity is presented in sec .",
    "@xmath32 . based on our calculation results , a particular geometry of the reference cavity",
    "is chosen , and re - entrant fs mirrors are used to replace the traditional ule mirrors . with this geometry , in sec .",
    "@xmath33 we analyze the zero crossing temperature of the composite cavity with finite elements analysis ( fea ) , and compare the results with that of the other approaches . for completeness , in sec .",
    "@xmath34 we also design the cavity to be vibration - insensitive .",
    "finally we concluded in sec . @xmath35 .",
    "the stability of a reference cavity is limited by an inevitable mechanical thermal fluctuation due to the brownian motions of materials . from the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ,",
    "the most significant parameters in the calculation of the thermal noise spectrum for a given structure are the mechanical quality @xmath24 factors of materials .",
    "materials with higher @xmath24 factors generate less mechanical dissipation , thus contribute smaller thermal noise . to get an order of magnitude estimation of their contributions , using the formulas given in @xcite , the power spectral density of mirror displacement due to thermal noise , @xmath36 , which typically dominates the spacer contribution ,",
    "is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the boltzmann s constant , @xmath39 is the temperature , @xmath40 is the poisson s ratio of mirror substrate , @xmath41 is the young s modulus of mirror substrate , @xmath42 is the beam radius , @xmath43 is the mechanical quality factor of the mirror substrate ( coating ) , and @xmath44 is the coating thickness ( @xmath45 @xmath46 m ) . in addition , the spacer contribution can be written as @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the spacer length and radius , respectively , @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the young s modulus and mechanical quality factor of the spacer , respectively .",
    "the total reference cavity displacement power spectral density due to thermal noise is @xmath52 from which we can calculate the allan deviation of the relative stability of the cavity as @xmath53    from eq .",
    "( [ gm ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ gsp ] ) , we can see that by choosing materials of higher @xmath24 factors , the thermal noise limit can be efficiently lowered . among the low cte materials that are commonly used in ultra - stable cavities",
    ", ule has a @xmath24 factor of @xmath54 that is more than one order of magnitude larger than that of zerodur ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "furthermore , fs has an even larger @xmath24 factor of about @xmath56 @xcite . in cases where thermal noise limits are the ultimate limiting factor of achievable cavity stability",
    ", it is very effective to use a higher @xmath24 factor material ( like fs ) as mirror substrate while keeping ule as spacer material .        according to eq .",
    "( [ allan ] ) , using longer cavity can also have the benefit of suppressing the thermal noise .",
    "in addition , the total thermal noise limit also depends on the laser beam sizes on the reflecting mirror surfaces .",
    "larger beam radius contributes a lower thermal noise .",
    "taking into account of all these effects , we calculated the thermal noise limits of cavities with different dimensions and configurations , expressed in both allan deviation and frequency spectral density , and the data are listed in table  [ table ] . by replacing ule mirrors with fs mirrors and increasing the cavity length from 10 cm to 30 cm , the thermal noise limit can be suppressed by nearly one order of magnitude .",
    "consequently in the following we will consider the design of a long , fs mirror substrate cavity .",
    "notice here that for longer cavity , the spacer radius is also increased .",
    "this is due to the fact that longer cavity is more susceptible to vibration influence , and larger cavity can help to suppress this effect .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ vibration ] . the detail",
    "is explained in sec . @xmath34 .",
    ".thermal noise limits of optical reference cavities with different configurations and dimensions .",
    "@xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath57 are the spacer length , spacer radius and approximate mode spot sizes ( intensity @xmath58 radius ) on the plano - confocal cavity mirrors , respectively .",
    "@xmath59 is the allan deviation of cavity stability and @xmath60 is the root cavity frequency noise spectral density at 1 hz for the 1064 nm light . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the cavities designed with re - entrant fs mirrors and fs rings have an excellent cte zero crossing temperature tuning property with a very low thermal noise limit . in order to reach this thermal noise limit ,",
    "the cavity should be further designed to be vibration insensitive .",
    "a quantitative analysis of the elastic deformation of reference cavities provides valuable guidance for cavity design .",
    "since the time - dependent vibration perturbation consists of a broad spectrum , in principle a full dynamic analysis of the cavity deformation is required to correctly predict the cavity vibration sensitivity .",
    "this dynamic analysis to our knowledge is not available in the literature .",
    "however , we can greatly simplify the process by performing static analysis .",
    "a static analysis can be used to approximate dynamic analysis because the following two conditions are satisfied .",
    "first , only the vibration modes with frequency lower than 100 hz are of interest , because the modes with higher frequencies will be significantly damped by either passive or active vibration isolations used in all reference cavities systems .",
    "second , the considered cavity dimension is much smaller than the cavity vibration characteristic wavelength , meaning that all particles move in - phase inside each eigenmode .",
    "thus the dynamic response of the cavity can be mimicked by applying a static force with the random acceleration frozen at that moment .",
    "for example , consider ule spacer material ( with @xmath61 of 2.21 g / cm@xmath14 and @xmath63 of 67.6 gpa ) , its dispersion relation is @xcite @xmath64 for oscillation frequency of 100 hz , the characteristic wavelength @xmath65 of 55 m is much greater than the simulated 0.3 m cavity length .",
    "consequently , at these low frequencies considered here the static analysis is a reliable substitute for the dynamic analysis .    in static analysis the elastic deformation of cavities caused by a gravity - like acceleration",
    "are studied . to understand the principle , for simplicity",
    "we assume the cavity is held in a plane instead of several mounting points .",
    "if the cavity is horizontally held on a plane from bottom , compression caused by acceleration normal to the supporting plane will cause expansion in length because of the non - zero poisson s ratio ; on the other hand , if the cavity is hung on the plane from top , the deformation is reversed , the cavity elongates in height and shortens in length . when the cavity is held on its symmetry plane ,",
    "the lengthening of the upper part and the shortening of the bottom part compensate each other and the axial length of the cavity remains unchanged under vertical accelerations . in practice , cavities are held on discrete points instead of the complete plane , which will cause additional bending deformation as well . the bending effect along with the simple compression or expansion , contribute to the total cavity length variation . in this case , the optimal supporting plane is no - longer the symmetry plane and the cavity length variation under acceleration is dependent on both the discrete supporting positions and the mounting plane of those discrete points .",
    "the bending of cavity will cause mirror tilting as well .",
    "if the cavity is supported on points locating at the two opposite sides along the horizontal axial length , it will bend downwards under vertical acceleration and the mirrors at both sides tilt correspondingly ; if the cavity is supported on the middle of its length , as an extreme , it will bend upwards , and the mirrors tilt in an opposite way .",
    "there must be a critical position along the length of the cavity ( airy points ) , on which the cavity is supported , so that the mirror tilting is eliminated by the compensation of both bending processes .    to eliminate both cavity length variation and mirrors tilting simultaneously in the case of our cavity design",
    ", we apply a notched structure @xcite to the cavities as shown in fig .",
    "[ vibration1 ] . in simulations ,",
    "we implement fea analysis by applying a gravity - like force on the cavity vertically with @xmath66 m@xmath67 , and the support with @xmath68 mm@xmath6 square on the notch surface is constrained to simulate the mounting condition .",
    "optimal dimensions of the notched structure are searched so that the two kinds of critical mounting positions with zero length variation and zero mirrors tilting of the cavity overlap , while maintaining a less rigorous requirement of mounting accuracy and machining tolerance .",
    "the definitions of parameters about the dimensional and mounting configurations are also illustrated in fig .",
    "[ vibration1 ] .     and @xmath69 ) of the notched structure , and positions of mounting supports ( @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) on the notch surface .",
    "( b ) fea simulations of the deformation of a quarter section of the cavity with optimal notch sizes and supporting positions under vertical vibration.,width=377 ]    during simulations , cavities with different notch sizes ( @xmath72 and @xmath69 ) are examined to search for an optimal dimension with which an overlap of the above two critical mounting positions is available . in most cases ,",
    "the mounting positions satisfying those two conditions do not overlap , which means only one of the effects can be eliminated .",
    "analysis results are shown in fig .",
    "[ vibration2 ] in which the mounting positions with zero length variations and zero mirrors tilting of different notch sizes are compared .",
    "calculations reveal that the mounting positions with zero mirror tilting angles are not sensitive to the changes of the notch sizes , while the zero crossing mounting positions ( where the length variations of cavities are immune to vertical vibrations ) are much more sensitive to the notch sizes , as shown in fig .",
    "[ vibration2](a ) and its inset .",
    "it is also found that at a particular value of @xmath69 ( or @xmath72 ) there is a corresponding @xmath72 ( or @xmath69 ) that can result in the overlap of these two critical positions .",
    "another important parameter is the slope of the cavity length variation curve , which reflects the sensitivity of vibration immunity to mounting positions accuracy and machining tolerance .",
    "different slopes of cavities with different notch sizes are shown in fig .",
    "[ vibration2](b ) .",
    "it indicates that the sensitivity of the frequency variation as mounting positions changes in the transverse ( @xmath73 ) direction is not sensitive to the notch sizes , neither @xmath72 nor @xmath69 , and has a value of approximately 42 khz / g / mm .",
    "in contrast , the sensitivity with mounting positions changes in the axial ( @xmath74 ) direction steadily decreases with decreasing notch sizes of both @xmath72 and @xmath69 . as a result ,",
    "smaller notches are much more preferred when optimizing the cavity dimensions .",
    "we choose dimensions of @xmath72=28 mm and @xmath69=49 mm and the corresponding optimized vibration sensitivity of the cavity are shown in fig .",
    "[ vibration3 ] .    , for cavity mounting with different notch sizes .",
    "( b ) the slopes near the zero crossing positions of curves related to the dependence of resonance frequency deviation on mounting positions under vertical vibrations with different notch sizes.,width=453 ]    .",
    "( b ) fea simulations of the axial length variations at the mirror center and mirror tilting angles at different mounting positions of @xmath70 .",
    "the cavity has notch sizes of @xmath72=28 mm and @xmath69=49 mm , under a gravitational acceleration of @xmath66 m@xmath67.,width=453 ]    with the optimized notch dimensions , both the length variation and the mirror tilting have a value of zero at the same mounting position . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ vibration3 ] , at the zero crossing point , the frequency variation has a very small slope against mounting position deviation in @xmath74 direction , which is 13.1 khz / g / mm , corresponding to a relative frequency instability of @xmath75 /g / mm at a laser wavelength of 1064 nm . the slope of mirror tilting in the axial direction is about @xmath76 nrad / g / mm , corresponding to about @xmath77 khz / g / mm , thus the relative frequency instability of @xmath78 /g / mm if the optical axis is displaced from the mechanical axis by @xmath79 mm .",
    "comparably , the slope of frequency variation in transverse ( @xmath73 ) direction is four times larger than that in @xmath74 direction , as shown in fig .",
    "[ vibration3](b ) , indicating that the cavity length variation is more sensitive and critical to the accuracy of mounting positions in @xmath73 direction .",
    "the slope of @xmath80 khz / g / mm corresponds to a relative frequency instability of @xmath81/g / mm at @xmath82 nm .",
    "the sensitivity of mirror tilting to mounting accuracy in @xmath73 direction is very small ( @xmath83 /g / mm at @xmath79 mm optical axis displacement ) and can be neglected .",
    "in conclusion , we have proposed a new ultra - stable optical reference cavity design with ule spacer , re - entrant fs mirrors and fs rings based on extensive fea simulations for different cavity structures .",
    "the designed cavity has an ultra - low thermal noise limit at the levels of @xmath0 .",
    "the zero crossing temperature of the effective cte of the designed cavity can be easily tuned to above room temperature with any ule spacer materials , as long as the cte zero crossing temperature of the selected ule spacer is measured beforehand .",
    "currently the cte zero crossing temperature of the ule spacer can be measured with an accuracy of @xmath84 @xmath30c at reasonable cost ( stable laser systems ) .",
    "this accuracy level is more than enough for our design purpose .",
    "no matter what the zero crossing temperature of the selected ule spacer is measured to be , one can always design a cavity with compatible fs rings thickness such that the zero crossing temperature of the effective cte is above room temperature .",
    "the design is applicable for cavities with different lengths .",
    "in addition , we have designed the reference cavity to be vibration insensitive through fea structure optimization .",
    "ultra - low thermal noise limit reference cavities play a key role in realizing ultra - narrow linewidth lasers .",
    "reference cavities based on ule and fs materials are still very popular choices for lab - based or portable ultra - narrow linewidth lasers . to further reduce the thermal noise limit to below @xmath0 , ule based reference cavities are no longer adequate . to this end , there are currently strong interests in the developments of cryogenic cavities based on single crystal silicon or sapphire @xcite .",
    "we hope the technique discussed in this paper can also stimulate ideas in the design of these cryogenic cavities .",
