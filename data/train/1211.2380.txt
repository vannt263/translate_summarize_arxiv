    "since the seminal work of bennett et al .",
    "@xcite , quantum teleportation undergoes rapid development both in the theory @xcite and experiments @xcite .",
    "particularly , quantum teleportation via free - space channels over 97 kilometres @xcite and 143 kilometres @xcite have been experimentally realized recently by two research groups leaded by pan and zeilinger , respectively .",
    "these finding rekindled the dream of people on constructing ultra - long - distance quantum communication networks on a global scale . to make this dream come true",
    ", one needs to face many actual challenges .",
    "one such challenge is the decoherence of quantum states due to its inevitable interaction with the surroundings @xcite . this unwanted interaction in most cases causes degradation of quantum correlations @xcite , and therefore limits the fidelity as well as the distance of quantum teleportation . even for the simplest protocol of one - qubit teleportation @xcite , there are many processes that decoherence may be set in , e.g. , the preparation and distribution processes of the shared quantum channels , the imperfect measurements of the information sender ( alice ) and receiver ( bob ) .",
    "all these make it significant and vital to investigate resistance of a teleportation protocol under the influence of decoherence , and this subject has been studied by many authors from the perspective of both noise channels @xcite and noisy operations @xcite .",
    "particularly , it has been shown that although entanglement is the necessary resource for quantum teleportation , in general its magnitude is not proportional to the value of the teleportation fidelity @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we study quantum teleportation of the single - qubit state in the bosonic structured reservoirs of the super - ohmic , ohmic and sub - ohmic types @xcite . through simulating numerically the dynamical behaviors of the average teleportation fidelity ,",
    "we show that the explicit form of the spectral density of the reservoir as well as the coupling strength between the channel and the reservoir have great impact on efficiency of quantum teleportation , and the quality of teleportation can be improved via the technique of reservoir engineering .",
    "the structure of this paper is arranged as follows . in section",
    "ii we recall some basic formalism related to the fidelity of quantum teleportation , and detailed the methods for solving the equation of motion for the channel state .",
    "then in section iii , we investigate resistance of quantum teleportation against decoherence induced by the super - ohmic , ohmic and sub - ohmic reservoirs .",
    "finally , section iv is devoted to a summary .",
    "in this work we concentrate on efficiency of quantum teleportation for a general one - qubit state , with a two - qubit state @xmath0 serving as the quantum channel .",
    "we suppose during the teleportation process , alice performs only the bell - basis measurement , while bob is equipped to perform any unitary transformation , then the maximal average fidelity achievable can be evaluated as @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 , with @xmath3 being the @xmath4 positive matrix with elements @xmath5 related to the bloch sphere representation of @xmath0 below @xmath6 with @xmath7 being the @xmath8 identity operator , @xmath9 are the usual pauli matrices , and @xmath10 .    to evaluate resistance of the teleportation protocol",
    ", we suppose the channel state consists of two identical qubits which coupled independently to their own reservoir , with the single `` qubit+reservoir '' hamiltonian reads @xcite @xmath11 with @xmath12 being the bohr frequency of the two qubits , and the index @xmath13 labels the reservoir field mode with frequency @xmath14 and the system - reservoir coupling strength @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) are the usual pauli raising ( lowering ) operator , while @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) are the bosonic creation ( annihilation ) operator .    under the assumption of zero - temperature reservoir and nullity of initial correlation between the qubit and the reservoir , the reduced density matrix @xmath20 for qubit @xmath21 ( @xmath22 )",
    "can be obtained as @xcite @xmath23 in the standard basis @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "the density matrix @xmath20 depends solely on the function @xmath26 , whose explicit time dependence contains the information on the reservoir spectral density and the coupling constants . to be explicitly",
    ", we consider here the family of reservoir spectral densities given by @xcite @xmath27 which simplifies to @xmath28 in the continuum limit of reservoir modes @xmath29 , with @xmath30 being the cutoff frequency and @xmath31 the dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "they are related to the reservoir correlation time @xmath32 and the relaxation time @xmath33 by @xmath34 and @xmath35 . by tuning the value of @xmath36",
    ", the spectral densities may be in the regime of sub - ohmic @xmath37 , ohmic @xmath38 or super - ohmic @xmath39 .    for this family of reservoir spectral densities",
    ", the function @xmath26 obeys the following integro - differential equation @xcite @xmath40 where the kernel function @xmath41 . after a straightforward algebra , eq .",
    "turns into @xmath42 in this work we take @xmath43 , 1 and 3 as three examples of the sub - ohmic , ohmic , and super - ohmic spectral densities . the kernel function",
    "can then be integrated as @xcite @xmath44^{s+1}}\\quad ( s\\in\\mathbb{z}),\\\\           & \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}\\eta\\omega_c^2e^{-i\\varpi}}{2[1+\\omega_c^2 ( t - t_1)^2]^{3/4}}\\quad(s=1/2 ) ,      \\end{aligned } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the factorial of @xmath36 , and @xmath46 $ ] . with the help of eq .",
    ", the function @xmath26 in eq . can be solved numerically and the two - qubit density matrix @xmath47 can be determined by the procedure of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in fact , the equation of motion of qubit @xmath21 can also be written in the following master equation form ( by differentiating eq .",
    "with respect to time ) of the form @xmath48 +                       \\frac{\\gamma(t)}{2}[2\\sigma_{-}\\rho^{s}(t)\\sigma_{+}\\nonumber\\\\                     & & -\\sigma_{+}\\sigma_{-}\\rho^{s}(t)-\\rho^{s}(t)\\sigma_{+}\\sigma_{-}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the time - dependent decay rate @xmath49 and lamb shift @xmath50 given by @xcite @xmath51,~   \\omega(t)=-2{\\rm im}\\left[\\frac{\\dot{p}(t)}{p(t)}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in general , the absolute values of @xmath49 may be larger than unity . in the following ,",
    "we define the normalized decay rate @xmath52 for better visualizing the corresponding phenomena , where the maximum is taken over the entire time region for fixed @xmath31 and @xmath30 .",
    "here we suppose the channel state is prepared initially in the werner - like state @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath55 is entangled if @xmath56 and separable if @xmath57 . for this kind of @xmath55",
    ", we have @xmath58 therefore the average teleportation fidelity @xmath59 is determined by the absolute values of @xmath26 , and this applies to all kinds of reservoir spectral densities with the hamiltonian model of eq . .",
    "by combining eqs . and , one can identify three different types of behavior of the @xmath60 dependence of @xmath61 ( see , fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) , which depend on the values of the mixing parameter @xmath62 : ( i ) for @xmath63 , @xmath59 decays monotonically with the decrease of @xmath60 and arrives at the classical limiting value of @xmath64 when @xmath65 ; ( ii ) for @xmath66 , @xmath59 first decays with the decrease of @xmath60 , and then increase with the decrease of @xmath60 after the critical point @xmath67 , and @xmath59 is larger than @xmath64 only when @xmath68 ; ( iii ) for @xmath69 , although @xmath59 still decays with the decrease of @xmath60 , and increase with the decrease of @xmath60 after @xmath70 , its value can not exceed @xmath64 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] we display dynamical behaviors of the average teleportation fidelity @xmath59 for the case of super - ohmic reservoir with the cutoff frequency @xmath71 , mixing parameter @xmath63 and different coupling strengths @xmath31 .",
    "one can see that in the weak - coupling regime ( e.g. , @xmath72 ) , @xmath59 decays monotonically and approaches to its limiting value 2/3 only when @xmath73 .",
    "if one enlarges the coupling strength moderately ( e.g. , @xmath74 ) , the strong non - markovian effect dominates and this leads to an obvious oscillation of @xmath61 , but in the long - time limit it still reaches the classical limiting value 2/3 .",
    "if one further increases the coupling strength to a much larger value ( e.g. , @xmath75 ) , however , @xmath59 firstly experiences some oscillations , and then approaches to a finite value larger than 2/3 in the long - time limit .    to understand the physical mechanism responsible for the above phenomena",
    ", we plot in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] the behaviors of the normalized decay rate @xmath76 .",
    "clearly , for @xmath72 the decay rate maintains a finite value after one oscillation , and thus deprives the quantum advantage of the teleportation protocol in the long - time limit . for @xmath75 , however , @xmath76 approaches zero after some oscillations due to the energy and/or information exchanging back and forth between the qubits and their independent memory reservoirs , and this leads to @xmath77 even in the long - time limit .",
    "the origin of @xmath78 for @xmath75 can also be explained from the formation of the bound state in the system .",
    "in fact , for the hamiltonian model of eq . with the spectral densities of the form of eq . , the conditions for formation of a bound state can be determined as @xmath79 by the same methodology of ref .",
    "for the system parameters chosen in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ( i.e. , @xmath80 and @xmath71 ) , @xmath75 is clearly larger than its critical value 0.5 , and therefore @xmath78 . for @xmath72 and 0.35 , which are smaller than 0.5 and thus @xmath81 , although there may be weak enhancement of @xmath59 ( e.g. , @xmath74 ) during certain @xmath82 regions caused by the non - markovian effects .    when considering the ohmic ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) and sub - ohmic ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ) reservoirs , similar phenomena are observed ( the oscillating behaviors of @xmath59 for the ohmic reservoir with @xmath75 and sub - ohmic reservoir with @xmath83 are very weak and unobvious in the plots ) , with however different critical coupling strengths for the formation of a bound state .",
    "this corroborates the observation derived for the case of super - ohmic reservoir .    to further understand the relations between dynamical behaviors of @xmath59 and @xmath76 , we reexamine eq .",
    ", from which one can derive @xmath84 , with @xmath85 .",
    "therefore @xmath86 when @xmath87 decreases with time , and @xmath88 when @xmath87 increases with time . as @xmath59 is a monotonic increasing function of @xmath89 in the region of @xmath90 , @xmath59",
    "is increased whenever @xmath88 , and decreased whenever @xmath86 during this region . in the region of @xmath91 , however , @xmath59 is a monotonic decreasing function of @xmath89 , thus @xmath59 is decreased whenever @xmath88 , and increased whenever @xmath86 . but it should be note that for this case ( i.e. , @xmath91 ) , @xmath59 can not be larger than its classical limiting value 2/3 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] we gave an exemplified plot of the time dependence of @xmath59 and @xmath76 certifying explicitly the above general arguments .",
    "when @xmath63 , as mentioned above , @xmath61 behaves as a monotonic increasing function of @xmath89 in the whole time region , thus it is increased when @xmath88 and decreased when @xmath86 .",
    "for @xmath92 we have @xmath93 during the time region @xmath94 , and from the solid red line shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , one can see obviously that @xmath59 is decreased if @xmath88 and increased if @xmath86 . as the negativity of the decay rate is a signature of strong backaction of the non - markovian memory effect of the reservoir",
    ", the decrement of @xmath59 with @xmath88 indicates that the back flow of information from the environment to the channel does not always improve quality of teleportation .",
    "in summary , we have studied quantum teleportation of a general one - qubit state in the bosonic structured reservoirs with spectral densities of the super - ohmic , ohmic and sub - ohmic types . through comparing dynamical behaviors of the average teleportation fidelity @xmath59 with different system - reservoir parameters ,",
    "we show that the structures of the reservoirs play a decisive role on quality of teleportation , and @xmath59 can be improved by the technique of reservoir engineering , e.g. , by tuning the reservoir structures so that there are bound state formulated .",
    "we have also compared behaviors of @xmath59 with that of the decay rate @xmath76 , and revealed the relationships between the negativity / positivity of @xmath76 and the enhancement / decrement of @xmath59 .",
    "as it is now possible to simulate and control the non - markovian effect @xcite , we hope our results may be certified with state - of - the - art experiments , and at the same time shed some new light for exploring the relationship between non - markovianity of the reservoir and the efficiency for performing certain quantum protocols .",
