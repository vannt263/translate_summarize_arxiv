    "the following work is based on two recent results concerning rohlin s multifold mixing problem which are contained in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it seemed to me interesting to put these results together and show them in a different light , emphasizing mainly on the underlying ideas rather than on technical details .",
    "the object of our study is a stochastic process , that is to say a family @xmath3 of random variables indexed by the set of integers , and we will always assume that these random variables take their values in a finite alphabet @xmath4 .",
    "if two integers @xmath5 are given , we will denote by @xmath6 the finite sequence @xmath7 .",
    "obvious generalization of this notation to the case where @xmath8 or @xmath9 will also be used .",
    "we are more particularly interested in the case where the stochastic process is _ stationary _ , which means that the probability of observing a given cylindrical event @xmath10 ( _ i.e. _ an event depending only on finitely many coordinates ) at any position @xmath11 does not depend on @xmath12 : @xmath13 another way to characterize the stationarity of the process is to say that its distribution is invariant by the coordinate shift : let @xmath14 be the transformation defined by @xmath15 , where for all @xmath11 , @xmath16 .",
    "then the stochastic process @xmath17 is stationary if and only if the distribution of @xmath18 is the same as the distribution of @xmath17 .    the stochastic process @xmath17 is said to be _ mixing _ if , considering two windows of arbitrarily large size @xmath19 , what happens in one window is asymptotically independent of what happens in the second window when the distance between them tends to infinity : @xmath20{}}\\ 0.\\ ] ]      in 1949 , v.a .",
    "rohlin @xcite proposed a strengthening of the previous definition involving more than two windows : @xmath17 is said to be _ 3-fold mixing _ if @xmath21{}}\\ 0.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] a straightforward generalization to @xmath22 windows naturally gives rise to the property of being _",
    "@xmath22-fold mixing_. to avoid any confusion , we will henceforth call the classical mixing property defined by  : _ _ 2-fold mixing__-fold mixing originally involved @xmath23 windows , thus the classical mixing property was called _",
    "1-fold mixing_. however it seems that the convention we adopt here is used by most authors , and we find it more coherent when translated in the language of multifold self - joinings ( see section  [ joining - section ] ) . ] .",
    "rohlin asked whether any stationary process which is 2-fold mixing is also 3-fold mixing .",
    "this question is still open today , but a large number of mathematical works have been devoted to the subject .",
    "many of these works show that 2-fold mixing implies 3-fold mixing for special classes of stationary processes ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite and @xcite for gaussian processes , @xcite for processes with singular spectrum , @xcite and @xcite for finite - rank processes ) .      in the opposite direction ,",
    "ledrappier @xcite produced in 1978 a counterexample showing that in the case of stationary processes indexed by @xmath1 ( we should rather speak of stationary _ random fields _ in this context ) , 2-fold mixing does not necessarily imply 3-fold mixing . here is a description of his example : consider @xmath24 let us describe a probability law @xmath25 on @xmath26 by the way we pick a random element in @xmath26 : first , use independent unbiased coin tosses to choose the @xmath27 on the horizontal axis ( one coin toss for each @xmath11 : these random variables are independent ) .",
    "now , note that the  3-dot rule \" @xmath28 for each @xmath29 completely determines the coordinates @xmath30 on the upper - half plane @xmath31 .",
    "it remains to choose the @xmath30 for @xmath32 .",
    "for this , observe that we have yet no constraint on @xmath33 .",
    "we choose it with an unbiased coin toss , and then the entire line @xmath34 is completely determined by the 3-dot rule . to complete the whole plane",
    ", we just have to pick each of the @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) with a coin toss , and then inductively fill each horizontal line with the 3-dot rule .    .",
    "first , use independent coin tosses to choose the values of the shaded cells , then apply the 3-dot rule to complete the others : three adjacent cells disposed as the three dotted ones must contain an even number of 1 s . ]",
    "the addition mod 2 on each coordinate turns @xmath26 into a compact abelian group .",
    "we let the reader check that the probability law @xmath25 defined above on @xmath26 is invariant by addition of an arbitrary element of @xmath26 , thus @xmath25 is the unique normalized haar measure on @xmath26 . since any shift of coordinates in @xmath1 is an automorphism of the group @xmath26 , such a shift preserves @xmath25 .",
    "hence @xmath25 turns @xmath37 into a stationary random field .",
    "the definition of @xmath22-fold mixing for a stationary random field is formally the same as in the case of processes , except that a window is no longer an interval on the line but a square in the plane : @xmath38 for some @xmath39 and some @xmath40 .",
    "let us sketch a geometric argument showing why the 2-fold mixing property holds for @xmath37 .",
    "starting with the cells on the horizontal axis and the lower - half vertical axis filled with independent coin tosses , we observe that , when filling the other cells using the 3-dot rule ,    * the region @xmath41 only depends on the cells @xmath42 , for @xmath43 ; * the region @xmath44 only depends on the cells @xmath45 , for @xmath32 ; * the region @xmath46 only depends on the cells @xmath42 , for @xmath47 .",
    "( see figure  [ fig : independentregions ] . )",
    "these three regions are therefore independent . now , if we take two windows of size @xmath19 , and if the distance between them is large enough (  large enough \" depending on @xmath19 ) , it is always possible to shift the coordinates in such a way that each of the shifted windows entirely lies in one of these three regions , and not both in the same region .",
    "the two shifted windows are then independent , and since @xmath25 is preserved by coordinate shift , this means that the two windows we started with are also independent .",
    "it remains to see why ledrappier s example is not 3-fold mixing .",
    "for this , apply the 3-dot rule from corner @xmath29 , from corner @xmath48 and from corner @xmath49 , then add the three equalities ( see figure  [ fig : not3foldmixing ] ) . in the sum , the random variables @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are counted twice , thus they vanish since we work modulo  2 .",
    "we get the following equality , which could be called the _",
    "scale-2 3-dot rule _ : @xmath53 a straightforward induction then shows that for any @xmath54 , the _ scale-@xmath55 3-dot rule _ holds : @xmath56 but this shows that the three windows of size 1 @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are always far from being independent , although the distance between them can be made arbitrarily large",
    ". hence the random field @xmath17 is not 3-fold mixing .",
    "in this section we describe a naive attempt to mimic the 3-dot construction on a one - dimensional process .",
    "our process will take its values in the same alphabet @xmath60 as for ledrappier s example , and we start by randomly picking the two random variables @xmath61 and @xmath62 with two independent unbiased coin tosses : @xmath61 and @xmath62 are independent , and each one is equal to 1 with probability @xmath63 . then , we set @xmath64 each random variable @xmath65 is called a @xmath66-block , and the triple @xmath67 is called a _",
    "1-block_. we pick the second 1-block @xmath68 in the same way as the first one , but independently .",
    "the third 1-block @xmath69 is now set to be the pointwise sum of the first two 1-blocks : @xmath70 observe that this third 1-block follows the same distribution as the first two : @xmath71 and @xmath72 are two independent bernoulli random variables with parameter @xmath63 , and @xmath73 is the sum mod  2 of these variables .",
    "note also that the third 1-block is independent of the first one , independent of the second one , but of course not independent of the first two together .",
    "the 9-tuple @xmath74 is called a _",
    "2-block_.    we can repeat this procedure inductively to construct @xmath22-blocks for each @xmath75 : suppose that for some @xmath22 we already have constructed the first @xmath22-block , which is the @xmath76-tuple @xmath77",
    ". then , choose the second @xmath22-block @xmath78 with the same probability distribution , but independently of the first one , and set the third @xmath22-block @xmath79 to be the pointwise sum of the first two @xmath22-blocks : @xmath80        this inductive procedure gives the construction of a stochastic one - dimensional process @xmath81 .",
    "( this construction can easily be extended to a process indexed by @xmath82 : set the negative coordinates independently of the nonnegative ones by a similar symmetric construction . )",
    "let us sketch the proof that our process is 2-fold mixing .",
    "for this , we use the two following facts , whose verification is left to the reader :    * two different @xmath22-blocks are always independent .",
    "* call a _ @xmath22-overlapping _ the concatenation of two consecutive @xmath83-blocks lying in two different @xmath22-blocks .",
    "any @xmath22-overlapping is independent of any concatenation of two consecutive @xmath83-blocks lying in other @xmath22-blocks .",
    "now , take two windows of fixed size @xmath19 , and let @xmath22 be an integer such that @xmath84 . then , if the distance between the two windows is greater than @xmath76 , either they lie in two different @xmath22-blocks , or at least one of them lie in a @xmath22-overlapping . in both cases",
    "the two windows are independent .",
    "however , the stochastic process @xmath17 is clearly not 3-fold mixing , since for any @xmath85 , we have @xmath86 this , of course , does not make @xmath17 a counterexample to rohlin s question : the process we have just constructed is not a stationary one !",
    "indeed , the pattern ` 111 ' for example can not be seen in the sequence @xmath87 , but it can occur in the sequence @xmath88 with probability 1/8 .",
    "the example described in the preceding section can be turned into a stationary process by applying some trick which is presented here .",
    "the process is still inductively constructed with @xmath22-blocks which follow the same distribution as before .",
    "the difference consists in the way @xmath22-blocks are extended to @xmath89-blocks .",
    "observe that a @xmath22-block lying in a given @xmath89-block can have three positions , which will be denoted by ` 0 ' ( the first @xmath22-block in the @xmath89-block ) , ` 1 ' ( the second one ) and ` 2 ' ( the third one ) .",
    "we are going to define the increasing family of @xmath22-blocks ( @xmath75 ) containing the coordinate @xmath61 by using a sequence @xmath90 of independent , uniformly distributed random variables , taking their values in @xmath91 .",
    "we start the construction by picking the first @xmath66-block @xmath61 in the usual way , with a coin toss .",
    "now , we have to decide whether this @xmath66-block is in the first , second or third position in the @xmath92-block .",
    "this is done by using the first random variable @xmath93 .",
    "next , we complete the @xmath92-block by tossing a coin for the first missing variable , and setting the last one to be the sum mod  2 of the two others .",
    "the extension from the @xmath22-block to the @xmath89-block containing @xmath61 goes on in a similar way : once we have determined the @xmath22-block , we use the random variable @xmath94 to decide whether this @xmath22-block is in the first , second or third position in the @xmath89-block . then the first missing @xmath22-block is chosen independently , and the last one is set to be the pointwise sum of the two other @xmath22-blocks .    the embedding of @xmath22-blocks in @xmath23-blocks is called the _ skeleton _ of the process , and the i.i.d .",
    "sequence @xmath95 coding this embedding is the _ skeleton sequence_. since almost every realization of the skeleton sequence contains infinitely many 1 s , the preceding procedure applied for all @xmath75 gives rise to @xmath22-blocks extending arbitrarily far away from 0 on both sides with probability one .",
    "this defines the whole process @xmath3 .",
    "let us see how the skeleton sequence evolves when a coordinate shift is applied to the process @xmath17 .",
    "it is not difficult to convince oneself that a shift of one coordinate to the left corresponds to the addition of ` 1 ' on the 3-adic number defined by the sequence @xmath96 .",
    "( write the sequence from right to left , and see it as a `` number '' written in base 3 with infinitely many digits , @xmath93 being the unitary digit ; then add ` 1 ' to the sequence as you would do it for an ordinary number : add ` 1 ' to @xmath93 , and if @xmath93 reaches 3 , then set @xmath97 and add ` 1 ' to @xmath98 , and so on . )",
    "observe that the distribution of the skeleton sequence is the same after this addition of ` 1 ' , hence the distribution of the skeleton is invariant under the action of the coordinate shift .",
    "but once the skeleton is fixed , the distribution of the process is entirely determined by giving the distribution of @xmath22-blocks for every @xmath75 , which is the distribution described in the preceding section .",
    "therefore the whole distribution of the process is invariant under the coordinate shift , and the process we get now is stationary .",
    "unfortunately , making the process stationary has a cost : we have lost the 2-fold mixing property ! indeed , if for example we look at the rightmost coordinate @xmath93 of the skeleton sequence , we see that any realization of the process @xmath17 gives rise for @xmath93 to the periodic sequence @xmath99 so , the process we get when we only observe @xmath93 is periodic .",
    "but if @xmath17 was 2-fold mixing , then every _ factor _ of @xmath17 ( that is to say , every stationary process which can be seen as a function of @xmath17 , such as the process generated by @xmath93 for example . ] ) would also be 2-fold mixing .",
    "the stationary process generated by the whole skeleton sequence @xmath100 is well - known in ergodic theory , and is called the _ 3-adic odometer_. ( be careful : @xmath100 does not take its values in a finite alphabet , it has infinitely many coordinates taking their values in @xmath91 . )",
    "this process , which has appeared as a factor of @xmath17 in our new construction , is far from being mixing , since each of its coordinates is periodic .",
    "however , we can notice some interesting facts regarding the 2-fold and 3-fold mixing properties of @xmath17 .",
    "namely , once the skeleton is fixed ( that is to say , conditionally to the @xmath2-algebra generated by @xmath100 ) , the mixing properties of @xmath17 are similar to those of the non - stationary process constructed in section  [ non - stationary ] . thus , the process @xmath17 is 2-fold , but not 3-fold mixing _ relatively to the factor @xmath2-algebra generated by @xmath100_. ( more details on relative @xmath22-fold mixing can be found in @xcite . )",
    "it is a common idea in abstract ergodic theory to say that the study of stationary processes relatively to their factor @xmath2-algebras gives rise to similar results as in the absolute study ( one of the best examples of this fact is thouvenot s relative version of ornstein s isomorphism theorem @xcite ; another example is the proof of proposition  [ zero - entropy - proposition ] presented below ) .",
    "therefore , the process that we have just constructed could make us think that a one - dimensional counterexample to rohlin s question should exist .",
    "however , we are going to show in the next section that , if such a process exists , it must be of a different nature than this one , or than ledrappier s counterexample in @xmath1 .",
    "we need now to present a powerful tool which has been introduced in ergodic theory by furstenberg  @xcite : the notion of self - joining of a stationary process .",
    "let @xmath3 be a stationary process taking its values in the alphabet @xmath4 , and denote by @xmath25 its probability distribution on @xmath101 .",
    "take @xmath102 another process defined on the same probability space , taking its values in the same alphabet @xmath4 , and following the same distribution @xmath25 .",
    "then we can consider the joint process @xmath103 , taking its values in the cartesian square @xmath104 .",
    "if this joint process is still stationary , then we say that its distribution @xmath105 on @xmath106 is a _",
    "2-fold self - joining of @xmath17_. in other words , a 2-fold self - joining of @xmath17 is a probability distribution on @xmath107 whose marginals are both equal to @xmath25 , and which is invariant under the coordinate shift .",
    "let us see some simple examples of such self - joinings .",
    "the first idea is to take the two processes @xmath17 and @xmath102 independent of each other .",
    "then we get @xmath108 as our first example of a 2-fold self - joining .",
    "another very simple example is obtained by taking @xmath109 , and we denote by @xmath110 ( `` diagonal measure '' ) the 2-fold self - joining of @xmath17 concentrated on the diagonal of @xmath107 .",
    "this can be generalized by considering the case where @xmath102 is equal to a shifted copy of @xmath17 : we fix some @xmath111 , and we set @xmath112 for each @xmath11 .",
    "we denote by @xmath113 the shifted diagonal measure obtained in this way .",
    "the set @xmath114 of all 2-fold self - joinings of @xmath17 is endowed with the metrizable topology defined by the following distance : @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the countable collection af all cylinder sets in @xmath117 .",
    "this topology ( which is nothing else than the weak topology restricted to the set of 2-fold self - joinings of @xmath17 ) turns @xmath114 into a compact metrizable topological space .",
    "the link with the 2-fold mixing property is now straightforward : the stationary process @xmath17 is 2-fold mixing if and only if the sequence @xmath118 of shifted diagonal measures converges in @xmath114 to the product measure @xmath108 as @xmath119 .    to translate the 3-fold mixing property into the language of joinings",
    ", we have to generalize the notion of self - joining to the case where 3 processes @xmath17 , @xmath102 and @xmath120 with the same distribution @xmath25 are involved .",
    "this naturally leads to the definition of a _",
    "3-fold self - joining of @xmath17_. ( we can of course define an @xmath121-fold self - joining of @xmath17 for any @xmath122 , but for our purpose the cases @xmath123 and @xmath124 will suffice . )",
    "the set @xmath125 is also turned into a compact metrizable space when endowed with the restriction of the weak topology .",
    "particularly simple and interesting elements of @xmath125 are again the product measure @xmath126 and the shifted diagonal measures @xmath127 , @xmath128 , the latter denoting the distribution of the triple @xmath129 when for all @xmath11 , @xmath130    the process @xmath17 is 3-fold mixing if and only if the following convergence holds in @xmath125 : @xmath131{}}\\ \\mu\\otimes\\mu\\otimes\\mu.\\ ] ]    now , let us assume that @xmath17 is a 2-fold mixing stationary process which is not 3-fold mixing . then , since @xmath127 does not converge to the product measure , we can find a subsequence @xmath132 converging to some 3-fold self - joining @xmath133 .",
    "but the 2-fold mixing property of @xmath17 tells us that , under @xmath105 , the 3 processes @xmath17 , @xmath102 and @xmath120 have to be pairwise independent .",
    "hence , we get the following conclusion :    [ pij ] if @xmath17 is a 2-fold mixing stationary process which is not 3-fold mixing , then @xmath17 has a 3-fold self - joining @xmath133 with pairwise independent coordinates .",
    "the natural question now is whether stationary processes satisfying the conclusion of proposition  [ pij ] can exist .",
    "but , without extra requirements , it is easy to find examples of such pairwise independent self - joinings which are not the product measure : let @xmath17 consist of i.i.d .",
    "random variables @xmath134 , taking their values in @xmath135 , each one with probability 1/2 .",
    "take an independent copy @xmath136 of this process and set @xmath137 then the three processes @xmath17 , @xmath102 and @xmath120 have the same distribution , are pairwise independent , but the 3-fold self - joining of @xmath17 we get in this way is not the product measure .    however , this process is not a counterexample to rohlin s question .",
    "indeed , all its coordinates being independent , @xmath17 is of course @xmath22-fold mixing for any @xmath138 .",
    "it was thouvenot who explained that this kind of bernoulli shift situation could be avoided when one studies rohlin s question , because it is always possible to restrict the analysis to the case of zero - entropy stationary processes .",
    "a stationary process @xmath3 taking its values in a finite alphabet has zero entropy if and only if @xmath61 is measurable with respect to the _ past _ , _ i.e. _ with respect to the @xmath2-algebra @xmath139 .",
    "( main definitions and results concerning entropy in ergodic theory can be found _",
    "e.g. _ in @xcite . )",
    "[ zero - entropy - proposition ] if there exists a stationary process @xmath17 which is 2-fold , but not 3-fold mixing , then one can find such a counterexample in the class of zero - entropy stationary processes .",
    "one of the main ingredient to prove this result is the so - called _ pinsker @xmath2-algebra _ ( or _ tail field _ ) of the process , which is the @xmath2-algebra @xmath140 the pinsker @xmath2-algebra of @xmath17 is invariant by the coordinate shift @xmath141 : @xmath142 , where @xmath143 .",
    "therefore , if we choose any @xmath144-measurable random variable @xmath145 , taking its value in a finite alphabet @xmath146 , and if we set for all @xmath11 @xmath147 then the whole stationary process @xmath148 is @xmath144-measurable .",
    "what is remarkable is that such a process always has zero entropy , and that any stationary process @xmath149 with zero entropy which is a factor of @xmath17 is automatically @xmath144-measurable ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite , theorem  18.6 ) .",
    "besides , krieger s finite generator theorem ensures that it is always possible to find such a factor process @xmath149 , taking its values in an alphabet @xmath146 containing only two letters , and generating the whole pinsker @xmath2-algebra ( nice proofs of krieger s theorem can be found in @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite ) .",
    "we henceforth fix such a process @xmath149 with @xmath150 as a factor of @xmath17 , @xmath149 automatically inherits the 2-fold mixing property .",
    "it remains to show that if @xmath149 is 3-fold mixing , then so is @xmath17 .    for this ,",
    "let us fix three cylinder events @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 , which are measurable with respect to @xmath154 for some @xmath40 .",
    "we have to compute the limit , as @xmath155 and @xmath156 go to @xmath157 , of the quantity @xmath158 the martingale convergence theorem gives @xmath159{l^1}\\ \\espc{\\ind{\\xi_0^{\\ell}\\in e_1}}{\\pi(\\xi)},\\ ] ] hence the first term can be bounded by @xmath160 if @xmath155 is large enough .",
    "we are left with @xmath161 and again the martingale convergence theorem allows us to replace @xmath162 with @xmath163 if @xmath156 is large enough .",

    "let us make some comment about this proof .",
    "the main argument is a nice illustration of the principle that the behaviour of a stationary process conditionally to one of its factors gives rise to similar results as in the non - conditioned case .",
    "the key notion here is the so - called _",
    "@xmath167-property _ : we say that the stationary process @xmath17 has the @xmath167-property if its pinsker @xmath2-algebra @xmath144 is trivial .",
    "it is easy to show that this @xmath167-property implies 3-fold mixing : just write the preceding proof until in the case where @xmath144 is trivial , and you get the result .",
    "( in fact , the same argument gives that the @xmath167-property implies @xmath22-fold mixing for any @xmath22 ) .",
    "now , when a factor @xmath149 of @xmath17 is given , we can also define the @xmath167-property of @xmath17 _ relatively to @xmath149 _",
    "( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , and check that @xmath17 always has the @xmath167-property relatively to its pinsker @xmath2-algebra : this comes from the fact that any factor of @xmath17 with zero entropy is @xmath144-measurable . but",
    "this in turn gives that @xmath17 is 3-fold mixing _ relatively to @xmath144 _ : this is more or less what says .",
    "the end of the proof consists in checking that , if @xmath149 is 3-fold mixing , and if @xmath17 is 3-fold mixing relatively to @xmath149 , then @xmath17 is 3-fold mixing .",
    "now that we have reduced rohlin s problem to the case of zero - entropy processes , we can ask the question of pairwise independent self - joinings in this zero - entropy class .",
    "[ pairwise - independent - question ] does there exist a zero - entropy , 2-fold mixing stationary process @xmath17 , and a 3-fold self - joining @xmath105 of @xmath17 for which the coordinates are pairwise independent but which is different from the product measure ?",
    "note also that if the assumption of 2-fold mixing is dropped , we can again find some counterexample : take a periodic stationary process @xmath17 taking its values in @xmath91 , where @xmath61 is uniformly distributed in the alphabet , and @xmath168 for all @xmath11 .",
    "take an independent copy @xmath102 of @xmath17 , and set @xmath169 then @xmath17 , @xmath102 and @xmath120 share the same zero - entropy distribution , they are pairwise independent but the 3-fold self - joining they define is not the product measure .",
    "let us consider now the two - dimensional example of ledrappier from the point of view of self - joinings .",
    "the definition of the shifted diagonal 3-fold self - joining @xmath127 is formally the same as in  , but in this case @xmath155 and @xmath156 are both elements of @xmath1 . particularly interesting",
    "is the sequence @xmath132 , where for all @xmath170 , @xmath171 from the relation , we see that the sequence @xmath132 converges as @xmath172 to the 3-fold self - joining @xmath105 of @xmath17 under which the three coordinates @xmath17 , @xmath102 and @xmath120 are pairwise independent ( because @xmath17 is 2-fold mixing ) , but which is not the product measure since , for all @xmath173 , @xmath174    observe also that , for the non - stationary process constructed in section  [ non - stationary ] , the sequence of 3-fold self - joinings @xmath175 also converges to a joining with pairwise independent marginals which , by  , satisfies a relation similar to .",
    "since this kind of self - joining seems to appear naturally when one tries to construct examples which are 2-fold but not 3-fold mixing , we introduce the ( slightly more general ) following definition .",
    "let @xmath17 be a stationary process taking its values in a finite alphabet @xmath4 .",
    "we call _ 3-dot - type self - joining _ a 3-fold self - joining @xmath105 of @xmath17 which has pairwise independent marginals , and for which there exists a map @xmath176 such that @xmath177    the result that we shall prove now shows that there is no hope to find a 2-fold but not 3-fold zero - entropy stationary process which admits a 3-dot - type self - joining : the only 3-dot - type self - joinings which can be seen in zero entropy are those arising from _ periodic _ ( therefore non 2-fold mixing ) processes , like in the example presented at the end of section  [ zero - entropy ] .    [ maintheorem ] if the stationary process @xmath17 admits a 3-dot - type self - joining , then    * either @xmath17 is a periodic process , * or @xmath17 has entropy at least @xmath178 .    the proof of the theorem is based on the following lemma .",
    "[ mainlemma ] let @xmath179 , @xmath180 and @xmath181 be 3 random variables , sharing the same distribution on the finite alphabet @xmath4 .",
    "assume that these random variables are pairwise independent , and that there exists a map @xmath176 such that @xmath182 then their common distribution is the uniform distribution on a subset of @xmath4    taking a subset of @xmath4 instead of @xmath4 if necessary , we can assume that each letter of @xmath4 is seen with positive probability .",
    "let us fix some @xmath183 , and condition with respect to the event @xmath184 .",
    "since @xmath179 , @xmath180 and @xmath181 are pairwise independent , we get for any @xmath185 @xmath186 but knowing @xmath184 , we have the equivalence @xmath187 since @xmath179 and @xmath181 can take the same number of values , we deduce that for any @xmath188 , there exists a unique @xmath189 such that @xmath190 and that furthemore , this @xmath189 satisfies @xmath191 finally , observe that we can condition on @xmath184 for any @xmath192 , and therefore that holds for any @xmath189 and @xmath193 in @xmath4 for which we can find a @xmath192 satisfying @xmath194 .",
    "but since @xmath179 and @xmath181 are independent , this is true for _ any _ @xmath185 .",
    "fix some @xmath195 , and apply lemma  [ mainlemma ] with @xmath196 , @xmath197 and @xmath198 under the 3-dot - type self - joining of @xmath17 : we get that @xmath199 is uniformly distributed on the subset of sequences in @xmath200 which are seen with positive probability . denote by @xmath201 the number of such sequences .",
    "the same argument applied with @xmath202 in place of @xmath203 gives that each of the @xmath204 possible sequences of length @xmath202 is seen with probability @xmath205 .",
    "therefore , any possible sequence of length @xmath203 has exactly @xmath206 different ways to extend to some possible sequence of length @xmath202 , and each of the possible extensions has a conditional probability @xmath207 .",
    "now , observe that since @xmath17 is stationary , the number of possible extensions of a sequence of length @xmath202 can not be greater than the number of possible extensions of the sequence of length @xmath203 obtained by removing the first letter , which gives the inequality @xmath208 .",
    "therefore , there are two cases :    * either @xmath209 for @xmath203 large enough , and in this case the process @xmath17 is periodic ; * or @xmath210 is always greater than or equal to 2 , and then the entropy of @xmath17 is at least @xmath178 .",
    "it seems interesting to analyze the result proved in the preceding section , to see precisely which obstacle prevents us from constructing a 3-dot - type counterexample in dimension one , although it is allowed in dimension two . at which point does the one - dimensional argument developped above stop applying to the case of dimension two ?    first , note that the reduction of rohlin s question to zero - entropy processes is still valid in the case of two - dimensional random fields : we can still consider in this case the pinsker @xmath2-algebra @xmath144 , with respect to which every zero - entropy factor of @xmath17 is measurable , and prove that if @xmath17 is 2-fold but not 3-fold mixing , then this property comes from @xmath144 .",
    "( for some presentations of the pinsker @xmath2-algebra in the multidimensional case , we refer the reader to @xcite . for the generalization of krieger s finite generator theorem to @xmath211-actions ,",
    "e.g. _ @xcite . )",
    "as far as ledrappier s 3-dot example is concerned , there is no need to take a factor since this stationary random field already has zero entropy .",
    "next , lemma  [ mainlemma ] gives that if @xmath17 is a finite - valued stationary random field indexed by @xmath1 admitting a 3-dot - type self joining , then the distribution of @xmath17 on any finite window is uniform on all the configurations which are seen with positive probability . and indeed , we can easily check that this is the case for ledrappier s construction ( for example , any allowed configuration in a rectangular @xmath212 window has probability @xmath213 ) .",
    "and this seems to be the point of the argument where there is a difference between @xmath82 and @xmath1 : although this uniform - probability property implies periodicity for one - dimensional zero - entropy stationary processes , this is no more true for two - dimensional stationary random fields , as we can see with ledrappier s example .",
    "we can also observe that in the one - dimensional case , if the stationarity property is dropped the argument fails at the same point : the relative counterexample constructed in section  [ stationarization ] , that is to say the process conditioned on the skeleton sequence , also has the uniform - probability property ( which means in the non - stationary setting that for any @xmath5 , all the possible configurations for the sequence @xmath6 have the same probability ) .",
    "however , this process has zero entropy : there exists almost surely some @xmath22 such that @xmath214 , therefore @xmath61 lies in the third @xmath22-block in its @xmath89-block .",
    "then @xmath61 can be computed from the first two @xmath22-blocks , which are measurable with respect to the past of the process .",
    "many important results have already been presented around rohlin s multifold mixing problem .",
    "most of them consider some special category of stationary processes ( _ e.g. _ finite - rank processes , or processes with singular spectrum ) , and prove that in this category a pairwise - independent 3-fold self - joining has to be the product measure .",
    "we hope that the work presented here can be the beginning of a slightly different approach : consider a stationary process which admits some kind of pairwise - independent 3-fold self - joining which is not the product measure , and see which other properties on the process this assumption entails . in this direction",
    ", the most natural generalization of the present study should be the following situation : take a stationary process @xmath17 which admits a pairwise - independent 3-fold self - joining @xmath105 , and assume that the three coordinates @xmath17 , @xmath102 and @xmath120 of this self - joining satisfy @xmath215 for some measurable function @xmath216 .",
    "then what can be said on the process @xmath17 ?",
    "can it have zero entropy and be 2-fold mixing ?",
    "since this general question seems to be quite difficult , some more restricted classes of pairwise independent self - joinings could be considered first , satisfying   with some regularity assumption on @xmath217 .",
    "for example , what happens if under @xmath105 , the coordinate @xmath218 is a function of finitely many coordinates of @xmath17 and @xmath102 ?",
