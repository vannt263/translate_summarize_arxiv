    "a weak scattering potential imposed on the @xmath0 layer of a cuprate superconductor creates ripples in the local tunneling density of states @xmath4 due to quasi - particle interference scattering .",
    "it was suggested that scanning tunneling measurements of the spatial and frequency structure of @xmath4 could provide information on the @xmath5 and @xmath6 dependence of the gap @xcite .",
    "recently , the introduction of high - resolution fourier - transform scanning tunneling microscopy @xcite ( ft - stm ) has provided a powerful new technique for studying this . in this approach",
    ", a bisco crystal is cleaved exposing a @xmath7 layer .",
    "then an stm measurement of the local tunneling conductance @xmath8 is taken over a predetermined @xmath9 grid of points that cover a region of order 600@xmath10600 .",
    "assuming that the tunneling conductance is proportional to the underlying density of states of the @xmath11 layer @xcite , these measurements give an stm map of the local tunneling density of states @xmath4 with @xmath12 .",
    "this map is then fourier transformed , @xmath13 and the wave - vector power spectrum , @xmath14 determined .",
    "typically , the square root of the power spectrum , which is proportional to the magnitude of @xmath15 , is plotted and we will follow that practice as well . here , we will discuss the structure of @xmath16 and its relationship to the quasi - particle spectrum and the structure factor of the scattering potential .",
    "for an isotropic @xmath2-wave superconductor with a circular normal state fermi surface , the ripples in @xmath4 produced by a weak scattering center form a circular pattern whose amplitude and wave length depend upon the bias voltage @xmath12 . however , if the gap has @xmath17 symmetry , the ripples emanating from a scattering center appear as a characteristic set of rays whose wave length and amplitude vary with their angular direction and the size of the bias voltage @xmath18@xcite . two examples of this",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "1 . it is the stm measurements of these modulations in @xmath1 that provide information on the wave vector and frequency dependence of the gap . indeed , in their ft - stm power spectrum study of bisco , hoffman _ et .",
    "al _ @xcite and mcelroy _ et .",
    "al _ @xcite found frequency - dependent structure in @xmath16 which they argued were consistent with the fermi surface dependence of @xmath19 as seen from arpes measurements @xcite . in this work @xcite",
    ", these authors suggested that the ft - stm data could be analyzed in terms of a set of frequency - dependent wave vectors @xmath20 which connect the tips of the constant energy contours specified by the quasi - particle dispersion relation @xmath21 the contours of the solid regions shown in figs .",
    "1(b ) and ( d ) are the constant quasi - particle energy contours for a cylindrical fermi surface @xmath22 with a gap @xmath23 for @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively . also shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) are several of the @xmath26 wave vectors introduced in ref .",
    "the wave vector @xmath27 is an additional wave vector that we will discuss .",
    "the wave vectors @xmath28 and @xmath29 , along with their symmetry - related counter parts ( not shown ) , are associated with the structure of the ripples in @xmath1 seen along the @xmath30 and @xmath31 axes of fig .",
    "likewise , the wave vectors @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 determine the structure of the ripples along the 45@xmath35 axes of fig .",
    "in conjunction with this experimental work , wang and lee @xcite recently reported numerical calculations for the case of a single impurity which clearly showed the quasi - particle interference arising from @xmath28 and @xmath36 .",
    "in addition , as @xmath6 is varied these calculations showed that a rich , kaleidescope - like , structure appears in the wave vector power spectrum when it is folded back into the first brillouin zone .    in a similar way , for @xmath37 , the wave vectors @xmath38 shown in fig .",
    "1(d ) , determine the structure of @xmath1 seen in fig.1  ( c ) . here",
    "the ripples along the @xmath30 and @xmath31-axes are associated with @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( and their symmetry related counterparts in the @xmath31 direction ) , while those along the diagonal are associated with @xmath41 ( and its counterparts ) . in practice , when @xmath42 , inelastic scatering leads to a damping of the ripples in @xmath1 , making the structure in @xmath43 associated with the @xmath38 wave vectors difficult to detect .",
    "now , the quasi - particle interference pattern shown in figs .  1(a ) and ( c ) are for a single impurity . for a particular surface region over which the stm measurements are made",
    ", there will be an array of scatterers leading to a complex overlap of ripples . here",
    "we will discuss how the fourier transformed wave vector power spectrum @xmath44 allows one to disentangle the quasi - particle interference effects from the static structure factors of the scatterers . in section",
    "ii we show that for the case of a weak scattering potential , @xmath16 factors into one piece which contains information on the nesting properties of the fermi surface times a piece which is proportional to the static structure factor of the scatterers .",
    "we also note that these measurements contain information on the one electron self - energy .",
    "various examples are analyzed to show the type of information that is in principle contained in the ft - stm data . in section iii ,",
    "the case of a layered 2d superconductor is studied with results for both @xmath2-wave and @xmath3-wave gaps discussed .",
    "section iv contains our conclusions and appendices a and b contain more details of the calculations .",
    "to begin , we first consider the case of a normal metallic 2d layer",
    ". suppose it is exposed to a weak potential @xmath45 with @xmath46 an energy shift at @xmath30 .",
    "for a bisco - like system this local energy change @xmath46 could arise from secondary effects associated with disorder away from the @xmath0 plane , the regular potential of the @xmath7 layer or possibly a weak static stripe potential .",
    "this interaction creates a ripple in the one - electron green s function leading to a modulation in the local tunneling density of states . for the case of a weak potential which we will focus on , a born approximation is appropriate so that the single particle green s function is given by @xmath47 here , @xmath48 is the green s function of the unperturbed system .",
    "then the change in the single spin tunneling density of states at position @xmath30 is given by @xmath49 taking the spatial fourier transform of @xmath50 , on the @xmath9 grid of points @xmath51 specified by the stm measurements , one finds for @xmath52 , that @xmath53 with @xmath54 and @xmath55 here @xmath56 is the lattice spacing of the @xmath9 stm grid and @xmath57 with @xmath58 and @xmath59 integers running from @xmath60 to @xmath61 . the wave - vector power spectrum of the local tunneling density of states , eq .",
    "( [ two ] ) , is therefore given by @xmath62 here @xmath63 is the number of sites in the sampled region .",
    "thus , in the weak scattering born approximation , @xmath16 separates into a piece @xmath64 which describes the quasi - particle interference and a piece @xmath65 which is the static structure factor , @xmath66 , of the scattering potential .    for the random impurity case",
    ", one could imagine making stm maps over a large number of different @xmath67 regions .",
    "then by averaging the structure factor over these maps one would obtain @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the area impurity concentration and @xmath70 is a site energy shift . in this case , @xmath16 would simply be proportional to @xmath71 times the quasi - particle interference factor from a single impurity .",
    "however , this is not the way the experiments are done .",
    "rather , a single stm map on a finite @xmath9 grid of points covering a specific region is measured . in this case , @xmath72 versus @xmath73 exhibits fluctuations bluring the image of @xmath74 , although one can still resolve structure in false color 2d @xmath75 maps of @xmath76 . however , as discussed in appendix a , by averaging the power spectrum over blocks of width @xmath77 about each @xmath73 , the fluctuations can be reduced if the impurities are randomly distributed .",
    "naturally , this reduces the momentum resolution .",
    "however , if the change in @xmath73 of the quasi - particle interference response is predominately along a given momentum direction , one can average over a region of @xmath73 values perpendicular to the direction of interest , reducing the fluctuations but maintaining the @xmath73 resolution in the direction of interest . here",
    "we will assume that a suitable average has been done and use the impurity structure factor given by eq .",
    "( [ avgstructf ] ) .",
    "appendix a contains a further discussion of the effect of impurity induced fluctuations .    for the case",
    "in which the scattering occurs from a regular lattice such as the @xmath78 lattice , one has @xmath79 here @xmath80 is a reciprocal lattice vector of the @xmath78 lattice along with the satellite wave vectors associated with the supermodulation of the @xmath7 layer .",
    "one could also have a `` random '' array of stripe domains with @xmath81 here @xmath82 with @xmath83 the stripe spacing , @xmath84 is the characteristic size of a domain and @xmath85 is the average number of domains in an @xmath9 region .",
    "here we have taken only the first @xmath86 harmonic .",
    "the form factor associated with the charge distribution of the stripes suppresses the response at higher multiples of @xmath86 .",
    "we will examine the effect of an array of scattering centers in section iii .",
    "turning next to the quasi - particle interference response , we begin by looking at @xmath48 for a free 2d electron gas . in this case , for @xmath87 , @xmath88 with @xmath22 and @xmath89 . here",
    "@xmath90 is the single spin electron density of states for the 2d free electron gas , @xmath91 is the zeroth order hankel function of the first kind , @xmath92 and @xmath93 when @xmath94 is large @xmath95 and the spatial modulation of @xmath50 which varies as the square of @xmath48 is characterized by a wave vector @xmath96    the quasi - particle interference response function @xmath97 for the 2d electron gas is calculated in appendix b. the result of this calculation shows @xcite that @xmath98 thus , the wave - vector power spectrum for the 2d free electron gas has a cusp at @xmath73 equals @xmath99 .",
    "@xmath100 vanishes for @xmath101 and diverges as @xmath102 as @xmath73 approaches @xmath99 from larger values . as noted in the appendix , @xmath103 has a similar cusp as @xmath73 approaches @xmath99 from below .",
    "basically , there is just a shift of phase of @xmath104 in @xmath105 when @xmath73 passes trough @xmath99 .",
    "if the impurities are dilute , but the scattering from a given impurity is strong , one still has @xmath16 proportional to the impurity concentration .",
    "however , in this case @xcite , because of the phase of the t - matrix one will have singularities on both sides of @xmath106 .",
    "the experimental ft - stm data has been reported as the square root of the power spectrum or `` the magnitude '' @xmath107 of the fourier transform of the stm measurement of the local conductance map . here",
    "we will follow this convention .",
    "for the case of weak born scattering , the magnitude of @xmath15 is proportional to @xmath108 . for the 2d electron gas , in fig .  2 , we have plotted @xmath107 normalized to @xmath109 versus @xmath73 for various values of @xmath110 . here , with @xmath73 in units of",
    "@xmath111 one has @xmath112 for @xmath113 . as shown in fig .  2 , for the weak scattering case @xmath114 has a one - sided square root singularity at @xmath115 .",
    "this singularity is cut off and the response peak varies as @xmath116 when the quasi - particle mean - free path is taken into account . in this case",
    "@xmath117 with @xmath118 .",
    "plots of @xmath114 versus @xmath73 for @xmath119 and several different values of @xmath120 are shown in fig .  3 .    similarly",
    ", for an anisotropic system with @xmath121 one finds that @xmath122 with @xmath123 . in this case",
    "the cusp in the power spectrum follows a locus determined by @xmath124 which reflects the elliptical fermi surface . in fig .  4 , we have plotted @xmath125 for @xmath119 and @xmath126 normalized to @xmath127 with @xmath128 and @xmath129 measured in units of @xmath130 . here",
    ", we see that @xmath131 vanishes inside the ellipse eq .",
    "( [ twentysix ] ) and has a square root divergence as @xmath73 approaches the ellipse .",
    "there is a reduction @xmath132 in the strength of the cusp along the @xmath129 direction relative to the @xmath128 direction that reflects the fact that the joint density of states which enters @xmath133 depends on the curvature of the fermi surface .",
    "turning now to the case of a tight - binding band , we consider first the simple nearest - neighbor hopping band for a square lattice with a unit lattice spacing @xmath134 the fermi surface is shown in fig .  5 for @xmath135 , corresponding to a small filling @xmath136 which we have chosen to illustrate what happens when @xmath137 is folded back into the first brillouin zone . in the following tight - binding bandstructure calculations",
    ", we will assume that @xmath4 is measured on a grid of points corresponding to the sites of the lattice .",

    "we have set the lattice spacing @xmath142 .",
    "this choice of the grid simplifies the calculations but has the consequence that all results are folded back into the first brillouin zone .",
    "it is this down folding that leads to the kaleidoscopic patterns in the numerical results shown in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the experimental ft - stm measurements",
    "@xcite , a smaller grid spacing was used leading to a @xmath73-space power spectrum which looks more like the extended zone picture for the @xmath73-vectors of interest .    carrying out the momentum sum in eq .",

    "6(a ) , @xmath73 varies along the diagonal a - cut shown in fig .  5 with @xmath144 .",
    "in this case , @xmath114 exhibits a similar cusp to that of the free electron system when @xmath145 .",
    "this same type of behavior is shown as the dashed curve for the b - cut with @xmath146 in fig .",
    "6(b ) , where we have displaced the numerical results by @xmath147 corresponding to an extended zone scheme .",

    "5 . in practice ,",
    "the numerical data is obtained in the `` reduced '' @xmath149 zone so that the @xmath146 b - cut appears as the solid curve shown in fig .",
    "as @xmath6 is increased , the characteristic @xmath73 values can move across the boundary of the first zone and be mapped back via a reciprocal lattice vector .",
    "this can then lead to a situation in which the square root singularity is approached from smaller @xmath73-values with @xmath150 vanishing when @xmath73 exceeds a critical value as shown by the solid curve in fig .",
    "as noted , it is this folding of the ft - stm power spectrum into the reduced zone that leads to the kaleidoscopic 2d @xmath75 patterns for different @xmath6 values which have been reported @xcite .    finally , consider the case of a tight - binding band , like that found for bisco .",
    "here , one has a next - near - neighbor hopping @xmath151 so that @xmath152 the fermi surface for @xmath153 and @xmath154 is shown in fig .",

    "this behavior is reflected in a shift in the position and a rounding of the cusp in the power spectrum @xmath16 . for values of @xmath6 which are small compared to a typical phonon frequency @xmath165 with @xmath166 the dimensionless electron phonon interaction strength .",

    "this is also the case for dilute impurities even if they act as strong scattering centers and @xmath242 is replaced by a t - matrix . for a normal metal , one can determine information about the nesting properties of the fermi surface from the loci of the @xmath243-space cusps for @xmath244 .",
    "in addition , the dressed fermi velocity can be obtained from the @xmath6 dependence of the position of the cusp .",
    "in fact , from the @xmath6 dependence of the cusp position and its rounding , one can , in principle , obtain information on the real and imaginary parts of the electron self - energy .    in the superconducting state",
    ", one can also obtain information on both the wave vector and frequency dependence of the gap @xmath245 .",
    "again , just as in the case of a normal metal , the signature of these quasi - particle interference effects are continuous `` arcs '' of cusps in @xmath243-space",
    ". however , the intensity variation along the arcs may be large due to changes in the effective density of states associated with a given momentum transfer @xmath243 , making the intensity appear more like spots .",
    "the rapid change in intensity is due to the small parameter @xmath246 .",
    "in addition to these effects , one can also obtain information on the static structure factor of the scattering potential @xmath247 .",
    "as discussed in appendix a , for the case of a local potential , averaging over a @xmath248 by @xmath249 block of @xmath73 values about a given @xmath73 leads to @xmath250 .",
    "however , if the scattering potential has long - range order , such as is the case for the @xmath7 over layer in the bisco studies , one should see a @xmath73-dependent response in the wave - vector power spectrum of the local tunneling density of states for @xmath243 values equal to the reciprocal lattice vectors of the @xmath7 layer .",
    "this response will be particularly strong for @xmath251 .",
    "similarly , it should be possible to see evidence of pinned stripes in the structure factor if they are present @xcite .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , we have focused on the case of weak scattering . as noted , in this limit , where the born approximation is adequate",
    ", one has a simple separation of the response into the quasi - particle interference effects which are contained in @xmath97 and the structure factor of the scatterers which is contained in @xmath252 .",
    "of course , many - body interactions will give rise to additional effects .",
    "there will be screening , changing @xmath253 to @xmath254 where @xmath255 is the zero frequency dielectric constant @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there will be vertex corrections so that for example , for a strongly - interacting normal system one will have @xmath256 with @xmath257 the elastic vertex for momentum transfer @xmath73 and zero energy transfer for an incoming particle with momentum @xmath5 and energy @xmath6 .",
    "similar vertex corrections will occur in the superconducting state .",
    "in addition , the quasi - particle dispersion relation can be altered by an interaction which breaks the translational symmetry @xcite leading to a different @xmath6 dependence of @xmath76 .    finally , there is the form factor of the tunneling probe .",
    "here we have neglected the momentum dependence of the tunneling matrix element and simply assumed that the conductance map was proportional to the local tunneling density of states @xmath1 .",
    "however , if this is not the case , a tunneling matrix element form factor @xmath258 will enter so that for a superconductor @xmath259\\ ] ] for example , a tunneling form factor @xmath260 has been suggested for the case of an stm tip on a cuprate superconductor @xcite .",
    "however . because the average tunnelling density of states in these stm experiments appears to vary linearly with @xmath261 at low voltages , we have modeled the tunnelling as a direct process and neglected its momentum dependence .",
    "suppose we have an @xmath67 section of a lattice with a concentration of @xmath69 impurities per unit area .",
    "assume that if there is an impurity at site @xmath262 it has a potential @xmath263 , while if there is no impurity at site @xmath262 , @xmath264 .",
    "for a given random configuration of @xmath85 impurities on @xmath265 sites , corresponding to an area impurity concentration @xmath266 , we have @xmath267 for this configuration of impurities we can define a power spectrum with @xmath268 there is of course a peak for @xmath269 , where @xmath270 however for other values of @xmath73 , @xmath271 fluctuates about @xmath69 .",

    "define a block smoothed @xmath271 average as follows : @xmath275 here the prime on the sum indicates that @xmath276 is replaced with @xmath69 so that the @xmath269 peak is not broadened from the smoothing operation . the sum in eq .",

    "the solid line in each of these figures is @xmath289 .",
    "it is clear from the results shown in fig .",
    "17 , that one can reduce the fluctuations in the power spectrum by averaging it over a region of q - space surrounding a given q - point .",
    "this is of course just complementary to taking the original @xmath67 spatial lattice , breaking it up into @xmath290 blocks with @xmath291 , constructing the appropriate fourier transform for each block and then averaging over the blocks .",
    "the more blocks one has , the small the rms fluctuations of the power spectrum of the fourier transform .",
    "of course , dividing the @xmath67 system up into more blocks leads to a corresponding decrease in the momentum resolution . the momentum smoothing operation , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : powspecsmooth ] ) , is just another way of blocking .    as a further test of these ideas , we calculate the rms deviation of @xmath282 from @xmath69 versus the momentum block size @xmath292 @xmath293 in fig .",
    "18 we show that @xmath294 varies as @xmath295 for large @xmath3 for several different concentrations of impurities .",
