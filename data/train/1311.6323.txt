    "consider the following continuous model for indirect measurements : @xmath14 where the data @xmath15 and the quantity of interest @xmath6 are real - valued functions of @xmath16 real variables and @xmath17 is a bounded linear operator .",
    "a large class of practical measurements can be modelled by operators @xmath17 arising from partial differential equations of mathematical physics .",
    "we focus on ill - posed inverse problems where @xmath17 does not have a continuous inverse .",
    "physical measurement devices produce a discrete data vector @xmath18 , which we model by adding a linear operator @xmath19 to ( [ contmodel1 ] ) : @xmath20 furthermore , practical solution of the inverse problem calls for a discrete representation of the unknown @xmath6 .",
    "this can be done using some computationally feasible approximation of the form @xmath21 , for example fourier series truncated to @xmath22 terms .",
    "the practical inverse problem is now @xmath23    we study the most common computational appoach to ( [ discreteinverseproblem ] ) , namely classical tikhonov regularization defined by @xmath24 here @xmath25 is a @xmath26 matrix approximation to the operator @xmath17 , and @xmath27 is the _ regularization parameter_. the matrix @xmath28 is used to introduce _ a priori _ information to the inversion .",
    "for example ,    * @xmath29 , the identity matrix , models the _ a priori _ information that @xmath6 is not very large in norm . * @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is a finite - difference first - order derivative matrix , models the _ a priori _ information that @xmath6 is continuously differentiable and @xmath6 or its derivative are not very large in square norm .",
    "our aim is to provide new analytic insight to the relationship between the continuous model ( [ contmodel1 ] ) and practical inversion based on ( [ discrtikh1 ] ) in the case of gaussian noise .",
    "note that the reconstruction @xmath32 given by ( [ discrtikh1 ] ) depends on both @xmath33 and @xmath22 .",
    "practical computational inversion may involve modifying both of them : updating the measurement device changes the number @xmath33 of data points , and refining the computational grid in the hope of extra accuracy will increase @xmath22 . furthermore ,",
    "sometimes the most efficient numerical algorithm is based on a multigrid strategy , involving the computation of @xmath32 with several different @xmath22 .",
    "since there is a common continuous inverse problem behind the discrete model , it is desirable that the reconstruction @xmath32 converges to a meaningful limit as @xmath34 .",
    "such convergence would also ensure that the dependency of @xmath32 on @xmath33 and @xmath22 is stable , at least for large enough values .",
    "therefore , we discuss a continuous version of ( [ discrtikh1 ] ) based directly on the ideal model ( [ contmodel1 ] ) .    under certain assumptions ( including that @xmath15 should be an @xmath4-function ) the finite - dimensional problem ( [ discrtikh1 ] ) @xmath35-converges as @xmath36 to the following infinite - dimensional minimization problem in a sobolev space @xmath37 :",

    "the case @xmath9 corresponds to ( a ) and @xmath10 corresponds , roughly , to ( b ) above .",
    "however , formula ( [ conttikh00 ] ) only makes sense if the noise in ( [ contmodel1 ] ) is square integrable .",
    "this brings us to the main topic of the paper : noise modeling .",
    "next we will give the definitions for the discrete and continuous white noise and describe the white noise paradox arising from the infinite @xmath4-norm of the natural limit of white gaussian noise in @xmath39 when @xmath40 .",
    "we model the @xmath33-dimensional noise in ( [ measprojectionpk ] ) as @xmath41 , where @xmath2 plays the role of noise amplitude .",
    "the vector @xmath42 is a realization of a @xmath39-valued gaussian random variable @xmath43 having mean zero and unit variance : @xmath44 . in terms of a probability density function",
    "we have @xmath45 the appearance of @xmath46 in ( [ gauss ] ) is the reason why square norm is used in the data fidelity term @xmath47 of ( [ discrtikh1 ] ) .",
    "the above noise model is appropriate for example for photon counting under high radiation intensity , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "let us relate the above to the continuous model ( [ contmodel1 ] ) .",
    "we take @xmath0 and @xmath48 to be functions defined on a closed , compact @xmath16-dimensional manifold @xmath49 , and the operator @xmath17 to be a pseudodifferential operator ( @xmath50do ) .",
    "furthermore , the noise in ( [ contmodel1 ] ) is modelled as @xmath51 , where @xmath2 is the noise amplitude and @xmath52 is a realization of normalised gaussian white noise @xmath53 .",
    "rigorous treatment of white noise on @xmath49 is based on generalized functions ( distributions ) .",
    "we denote the pairing of a distribution @xmath54 and a test function @xmath55 by @xmath56 .",
    "let @xmath57 be a probability space .",
    "a random generalized function @xmath58 , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 , on @xmath49 is a measurable map @xmath61 .",
    "below , following the tradition used in study of stochastical processes , we often omit the @xmath62 variable and just denote a random generalized function by @xmath63 .",
    "white noise @xmath53 is a random generalized function on @xmath49 such that the inner products @xmath64 are gaussian random variables for all @xmath55 , @xmath65 , and [ gauss infinite ] e(w , w,)=,c_w _",
    "l^2(n),c^(n ) .",
    "the covariance operator @xmath66 of gaussian white noise is the identity operator .",
    "then @xmath67 can be considered as a function @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the probability space .",
    "a realization of @xmath67 is the generalized function @xmath70 on @xmath49 with a fixed @xmath60 .",
    "below , we consider the case when [ pk definition]p_k(f)= ( f,_j)_j=1^k , where @xmath71 are such that @xmath72 is an orthogonal basis in @xmath73 .",

    "for example , when @xmath49 is a @xmath16-dimensional torus , @xmath19 can be the truncation of the fourier series .",
    "see section [ sec : gamma convergence ] for a detailed discussion on discrete and continuous noise models .",
    "now we can state the main motivation behind this study .",
    "the probability density function of @xmath67 is often _ formally _ written in the form @xmath76 however , despite formula ( [ formaldensity ] ) , the realizations of the white gaussian noise are almost surely not in @xmath73 .",
    "thus we can not use formula ( [ conttikh00 ] ) when the error in the measurement @xmath15 is white gaussian noise .",
    "let us illustrate this `` white noise paradox '' by a simple example .",

    "hence w_l^2(t^d)^2=_^d|w , e_|^2 < .",
    "this implies that @xmath81 with probability zero .",
    "however , when @xmath82 we have @xmath83 almost surely ( that is , with probability one ) . this can be seen as follows : the sobolev norm of @xmath67 is given by @xmath84 by ( * ? ? ?",

    "in particular for @xmath86 the function @xmath70 is in @xmath87 only when @xmath88 where @xmath89 . _",
    "even though the previous example is proven in @xmath90 we note that the same result is valid in all open bounded subsets @xmath91 .",
    "let us again consider a general closed @xmath16-dimensional riemannian manifold @xmath92 and let @xmath93 be the laplace operator on @xmath49 .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath17 be a pseudodifferential operator .",
    "consider the following measurement model : @xmath94 where @xmath95 with @xmath82 is a realization of white noise .",

    "@xmath105 is a pseudodifferential operator of order @xmath106 .",
    "let us now modify formula ( [ conttikh00 ] ) to arrive at something useful for white gaussian noise . expand the data fidelity term like this : @xmath107 .",
    "simply omitting the `` constant term '' @xmath108 leads to the definition @xmath109 where we can interpret @xmath110 as a suitable duality pairing instead of @xmath73 inner product .",
    "when @xmath17 is a pseudodifferential operator of order @xmath111 , we can define @xmath112 .",
    "it is well - known that the solution of the finite - dimensional problem ( [ discrtikh1 ] ) can be calculated using the following formula : @xmath113 the regularized solution of the continuous problem ( [ conttikh0 ] ) is @xmath114 the regularization parameter is chosen to be a function of the noise amplitude : @xmath115 where @xmath116 is a constant and @xmath117 .",

    "notice that in case ( i ) @xmath134 and in case ( ii ) @xmath135 .",
    "the different convergence speeds ( i ) and ( ii ) show the trade - off between smoothness of the space and the speed of convergence . in case ( i )",
    "we get better convergence rates but in case ( ii ) we can use a stronger norm . in section",
    "[ sec : deblurring ] we give two counterexamples to show that even though @xmath136 and @xmath137 the regularized solution does not converge to the real solution in @xmath37 norm .",
    "there are two main ways in inverse problems literature for modelling noise .",
    "the first approach based on the deterministic regularization techniques is to assume that the noise is deterministic and small .",
    "in that case one has a norm estimate of the noise and can study what happens when @xmath138 .",
    "this approach was originated by tikhonov @xcite , and studied in depth in @xcite .",
    "the second approach to handling the noise is based on statistical point of view .",
    "the statistical modeling of noise in the inverse problems started in the early papers of @xcite and it is notable that with this approach one needs not assume smallness of the noise .",
    "for some recent references of the frequentist view of statistical problems see @xcite . another statistical way to study inverse problems with random noise",
    "is based on bayesian approach where @xmath139 and @xmath140 are considered to be realizations of random variables , see @xcite .",
    "the deterministic regularization and statistical approaches differ both in assumptions and techniques .",
    "this paper aims to bridge the gap between them .",
    "our results are closely related to earlier studies of eggermont , , and nashed @xcite , who studied weakly bounded noise .",
    "they assume that the noise is a @xmath4-function and discuss regularization techniques when the noise tends to zero in the weak topology of @xmath4 .",
    "this kind of relaxed assumption of noise covers small low frequency noise and large high frequency noise .",
    "however , even though @xmath141 tends to zero in weak sense as @xmath142 when @xmath3 is a realization of the normalized white noise , this type of noise lies outside the definition of the weakly bounded noise as @xmath3 is not almost surely @xmath4-valued .",
    "a related approach of smoothing the noise before the analysis is described in @xcite . a similar regularization method where no smoothness of the operator @xmath17 is assumed , but instead the regularization method is modified , is studied in @xcite .",
    "another possible approach to deal with white noise is to first perform a data projection step and then proceed to tikhonov regularization @xcite .",
    "also , hohage and werner have earlier studied inverse problems taking into account the fact that white noise is not square - integrable in @xcite .",
    "our new results are different from all of those previous studies .",
    "our approach aims to study the effect of the continuous white noise not being an @xmath4 function in tikhonov regularisation ( [ conttikh00 ] ) instead of modifying the problem by altering the regularisation method or assumptions .",
    "before giving the general proof of theorem [ speedelliptic ] in section [ sec : generalproof ] we motivate the proof by proving a similar kind of lemma for translation - invariant case .",
    "the regularized solution we are studying is of the form @xmath143 where @xmath144 , for some constant @xmath145 and @xmath146 . as mentioned before solution to this",
