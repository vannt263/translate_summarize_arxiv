    "high - velocity molecular outflows were first discovered in 1976 @xcite , and are thought to be one of the earliest observable signatures of star formation  nearly all core - collapse candidate protostars are found to have outflows .",
    "indeed outflows are thought to be integral to the star formation process , as they remove excess angular momentum @xcite .",
    "however despite the ubiquity of outflows , there is still much that we do not understand about them .",
    "one example is the outflow driving mechanism : they are thought to be powered by the gravitational energy of the infalling material in a contracting core @xcite .",
    "however , as their source is usually deeply embedded in a dense infalling envelope , it is difficult to observe directly the outflow region and investigate the outflow driving mechanism .",
    "molecular outflows are thought to develop from the entrainment of low - velocity flows by well - collimated ( optical ) jets  the primary jet injects its momentum into the surrounding gas , resulting in a molecular outflow that traces the interaction between the jet and the surrounding environment .",
    "wide - angled winds sweeping up a shell of gas have also been invoked to explain outflows such as hh  211 @xcite . in these outflow models ,",
    "emission from molecular outflows originates from ambient gas that has been accelerated by a supersonic wind , and has been shock - processed .",
    "observations support this as outflows tend to be associated with other objects such as hii regions , hh objects , h@xmath5 jets and h@xmath5o masers .",
    "outflows and shock chemistry are therefore inextricably linked .",
    "some outflows show a greater degree of molecular richness than others  exciting a wide range of molecules and enhancing the abundance of some to many orders of magnitude over their standard molecular cloud abundances .",
    "these ` chemically - active ' outflows are not necessarily distinguishable using co emission ( although they do tend to be young class 0 sources ) , and their activity is also highly transient @xcite .    although sio is the canonical outflow tracer , molecules such as  and hcn are increasingly used to study outflows : the higher transitions ( e.g. @xmath2 ) trace both the dense gas associated with the protostellar objects , as well as any outflowing / infalling gas @xcite .",
    "this allows a comparison of the physical and chemical properties in the source envelopes , with those in the outflow lobes further away from the central sources .",
    "in addition , both these molecules have similar critical densities and excitation energies ( see table [ mol_trans ] ) , and are found to have highly - correlated spatial distributions .",
    "however , recent studies have shown that the abundances of the two molecules are enhanced to different degrees in particular outflows  have shown that the hcn abundance is enhanced by @xmath6 times more than the  abundance in the outflow linewings .",
    "one theory by @xcite is that the differences between hcn and  in the linewings can be attributed to the effect of magnetic field lines that are not aligned with the turbulent flow direction .",
    "the ions are trapped on the magnetic field lines while the neutrals follow the turbulent flow , resulting in the ionic species having narrower lines and suppressed linewings compared to the neutral species @xcite .",
    "this theory assumes that the two molecules coexist and sample the same parts of the molecular cloud , exposing them to the same dynamical processes .",
    "this is not necessarily the case , as  and hcn have similar critical densities and excitation conditions but follow different chemical networks @xcite , making it likely that differences in abundances between the two molecules are due to chemical effects .",
    "this difference in enhancements between the two molecules is therefore more commonly attributed to shock - chemistry , as hcn is known to be enhanced in shocks .",
    "@xcite have suggested that there exists an incomplete knowledge of outflows and their chemistry due to a too - focused approach on a few selected objects , and a lack of a statistically - significant number of outflows explored using molecules other than co. this dense gas survey of  and hcn @xmath2 transitions , over multiple sub - regions in the perseus molecular cloud , is thus very timely .",
    "these sub - regions have previously been observed in //  by @xcite , tracing the large - scale structure and kinematics of perseus , as well as the protostellar activity occurring there .",
    "we have performed follow - up observations using  and hcn ( @xmath2 transitions ) to characterise the denser ( @xmath0 > @xmath1  ) gas present , and to investigate a large number of previously - mapped outflows using our molecules for comparison .",
    "the perseus molecular cloud is a well - studied region of low to intermediate - mass star formation .",
    "distance estimates for perseus range from 230 to 350  pc , ; but for the purposes of this paper we assume the value of 250  pc used by @xcite , with whom we will be comparing our results .",
    "we investigate four sub - regions in the perseus molecular cloud with differing degrees of turbulence , clustering and star formation activity .",
    "a comparison of these sub - regions allows us to investigate the effects of the environment on the dense gas structure and outflow properties .",
    "the four sub - regions are :    1 .",
    "ngc  1333 : this is thought to be the most active and clustered region of star formation in perseus , and contains a large concentration of tt stars , hh objects , bipolar jets and outflows , all of which will affect the outflow properties that we calculate .",
    "it is fairly young  possessing cores at an age of @xmath7  myr ; it also has a lumpy and filamentary structure  dust ridges extend between clumps of ysos , and there are several cavities filled with high - velocity outflow gas .",
    "@xcite found that the strongest submillimetre emission originates in the south , and is associated with the ysos iras  2 , 3 and 4 . 2 .",
    "ic  348 : this is a slightly older region than ngc  1333 , but is still undergoing active star formation .",
    "the most well - known feature in the region is hh  211  a highly - collimated bipolar outflow driven by a class 0 protostar , which has been the subject of several interferometric studies ( e.g. chandler & richer , 2001 ) .",
    "l  1448 : this region contains a large number of young class 0 protostars , and has been found to be dominated by outflow activity , which argues for it being relatively young . in particular , the outflow l  1448-c has been studied in great detail .",
    "l  1455 : this is the smallest and faintest of the four regions .",
    "it has the highest proportion of class i sources ( compared with class 0s ) , which points to it being older than l  1448 .",
    "there are still quite a few prominent outflows , several of which have h@xmath5 objects associated with them @xcite .",
    "we present  and hcn molecular data that we observed in the perseus molecular cloud .",
    "section [ sec : obs ] presents an overview of the observations and data reduction procedure , and section [ sec : structure ] compares the spatial and velocity structures of the  and hcn emission .",
    "we present an analysis of outflow properties in the 4 perseus sub - regions , in both  ( section [ sec : hcooutflows ] ) and in hcn ( section [ sec : hcnoutflows ] ) , comparing the results obtained for the two molecules .",
    "section [ sec : abundances ] presents a comparison of the relative abundances of /hcn in iras  2 ( ngc  1333 ) to investigate the chemistry within the outflow .",
    "emission from  and hcn was observed and details of the transitions and frequencies are given in table [ mol_trans ] .",
    "the frequencies and energies quoted are taken from lamda , the leiden atomic and molecular database .",
    "the data were observed in single sub - band mode , splitting the 250  mhz bandwidth into 8192 channels , giving an initial velocity resolution of 0.026  .",
