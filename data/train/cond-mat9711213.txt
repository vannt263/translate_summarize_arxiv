    "consider a many - body quantum system of interacting particles .",
    "if the number of particles is large , statistical laws can be applied to describe the properties of the system .",
    "they can also be applied to few - particle systems ( or even single particles ) interacting with a heat bath . in both cases",
    "the equilibrium is achieved at arbitrarily weak interaction between the particles , or with the heat bath .",
    "if the interaction between the particles is strong enough , a different kind of statistical equilibrium is possible in isolated few - particle quantum systems .",
    "it is achieved when the excited states of the system become chaotic _ compound _ states .",
    "the systems examined so far are the rare - earth atom of ce @xcite with just four active valence electrons , 12 nucleons in the @xmath0 shell @xcite , and @xmath17 particles interacting by means of a two - body random interaction @xcite . in spite of the obvious differences these systems have much in common , as far as properties of their eigenstates and various statistics are concerned .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that in the regime of compound excited states one can introduce such thermodynamic parameters as temperature and entropy , and observe other typically statistical features , e.g. , the fermi - dirac distribution of the occupation numbers .    in the present work we concentrate on the statistics of the occupation numbers in a realistic fermi system : the atom of ce .",
    "we show that when the interaction between the particles is strong and the two - body matrix element fluctuates strongly as function of the single - particle states involved ( hence , there is no good mean - field approximation ) , large deviations from the fermi - dirac behaviour are observed .",
    "however , a statistical description of the system including the introduction of a temperature is still possible if the interaction between the particles is properly accounted for .",
    "the notion of compound states is important for our work , so we would like to explain it in greater detail .",
    "suppose that for a given range of excitation energies the interaction between the particles gives rise to a certain mean field .",
    "this mean field can then be used to generate a set of single - particle orbitals .",
    "the multiparticle basis states of the system can be constructed from these orbitals by simply specifying their occupation numbers .",
    "the spectrum of such states in a system with several active particles is very dense since there are many ways of distributing them among the orbitals . for the interacting particles these multiparticle states are not the eigenstates of the system .",
    "instead , they are mixed together by the residual two - body interaction .",
    "if this interaction is strong , the number of basis states `` involved '' in almost every eigenstate of the system becomes very large ( about 100 in atoms and up to @xmath2 in nuclei ) , and the eigenstates become almost random ( chaotic ) superpositions of the basis states , devoid of any good quantum numbers , save the exact ones  energy , parity , total angular momentum , etc .",
    "following the nuclear physics terminology we call such eigenstates _",
    "compound states_. their statistical properties , e.g. , distribution over the unperturbed basis states , are very similar in different systems studied : atoms , nuclei , or a two - body random interaction model .",
    "most importantly , they provide a good starting point for developing a statistical theory for isolated few - particle systems @xcite .",
    "statistical behaviour is usually established in the limit of a large number of particles @xmath3 . moreover , simple quantitative results can be obtained if correlations between the particles are somehow weak .",
    "this means that the interaction between the particles can be neglected , or  more realistically ",
    "an appropriate mean field theory is developed .",
    "the latter results in the picture of free quasiparticles moving in the effective self - consistent field created by the constituents .    in the limit of large @xmath3",
    "the temperature @xmath4 is a well - defined physical quantity and all equilibrium characteristics can be found by applying the canonical ( gibbs ) probability distribution @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the energy of the @xmath7th eigenstate of the system .",
    "for example , for a gas of noninteracting fermions this results in the famous fermi - dirac distribution ( fdd ) of the occupation numbers : @xmath8 + 1}~,\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the energy of a single - particle state @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the chemical potential .",
    "it is determined , at a given temperature , from the normalization condition @xmath12 .",
    "formula ( [ fdd ] ) , when it is valid , in fact provides one with a relation between the temperature and the energy @xmath13 of the system : @xmath14 , which can also be viewed as a possible definition of the temperature .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ fdd ] ) can hold for the interacting fermions as well , provided we consider the distribution of _ quasiparticles _ , and replace @xmath9 with the quasiparticle energy @xmath15 , which in turn depends on the distribution of excited quasiparticles .",
    "this is an important point of landau s theory of fermi liquids ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "strictly speaking , the fdd is derived for the grand canonical ensemble , where @xmath16 is fixed , and @xmath3 is the mean number of particles @xcite . for large @xmath3 the difference is negligible unless fluctuations of the number of particles are concerned . in appendix [ app ] we consider the approximations one has to make to arrive at the fdd ( [ fdd ] ) for a finite system of @xmath3 interacting particles obeying the canonical distribution .    in reality",
    "there are many complex systems , such as compound nuclei , rare - earth atoms , molecules , atomic clusters , or quantum dots , which do not satisfy the conditions for eq .",
    "( [ fdd ] ) to hold",
    ". however , their complexity suggests that some statistical methods can be developed , and in nuclear physics such statistical temperature - based description has been known for quite a while .",
    "intuitively such description is very natural , and a more rigorous justification does not seem to have been needed",
    ".    the number of active particles in these systems can be relatively small ( @xmath17 ) , whereas the interaction between them ( even the residual interaction in the mean - field basis ) is large , i.e. , greater than the energy intervals between unperturbed many - particle basis states .",
    "this interaction makes up for the absence of a heat bath , and promotes the onset of `` randomization '' and quantum chaos .",
    "this chaos is purely dynamical , in the sense that the hamiltonian matrix of the system does not contain any random parameters , yet , the behaviour can be complicated enough ( `` chaotic '' ) , and a number of properties , e.g. , the energy level statistics , are consistent with the predictions of random matrix theories @xcite .",
    "this gives one a possibility to talk about some kind of equilibrium in the system , and pursue the development of a statistical theory for few - body fermi systems @xcite .    in what follows",
    "we will look at the results obtained numerically in a realistic model of the ce atom which contains only four active particles ( valence electrons ) .",
    "we will see that the energy dependence of the occupation numbers differs prominently from what one expects from the fdd ( [ fdd ] ) , and show that this behaviour results from the strong fluctuations of the two - body coulomb interaction for different orbitals .",
    "we then show that this interaction can be taken into account within the statistical approach to calculation of the occupation numbers and other mean values , leading to a good agreement between the results of our _ statistical _ theory and the numerical calculations .",
    "such agreement confirms the existence of equilibrium similar to the thermal one in the system of a few strongly interacting particles .",
    "the cerium atom has one of the most complicated spectra in the periodic table .",
    "the density of energy levels with a given total angular momentum and parity @xmath18 reaches hundreds of levels per ev at excitation energies of just a few ev , well below the ionization threshold of @xmath19 ev @xcite .",
    "the ce atom has four valence electrons , and a well defined @xmath20 ground state .",
    "however , with the increase of the excitation energy and involvement of yet another low - lying electron orbital @xmath21 , the atomic eigenstates become compound states ( in the sense of sec .",
    "[ sec:1 ] ) , and it becomes absolutely impossible to choose any reasonable coupling scheme or provide any classification for them . at the same time , the orbital occupation numbers move away from integer values , and even the idea of a dominant configuration for a particular energy level becomes meaningless @xcite .    in the present work we continue to study the cerium atom numerically , with emphasis on the energy dependence of the occupation numbers . the electronic structure of the ce atom consists of a xe - like @xmath22 core and four valence electrons .",
    "a large difference in the energy scales of the core and valence electrons allows us to neglect excitations from the core and consider the wave function of the core as a `` vacuum '' state @xmath23 .",
    "accordingly , the four active electrons added to this vacuum form the spectrum of ce at excitation energies @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the calculations are performed using the hartree - fock - dirac ( hfd ) and configuration interaction ( ci ) methods ( see @xcite for details ) . a self - consistent hfd calculation of the neutral atom results in the construction of the core and valence orbitals .",
    "it also determines the mean - field potential , which is then used to calculate the basis set of single - particle ortho - normalized relativistic states @xmath25 with energies @xmath26 .",
    "this procedure defines the zeroth - order hamiltonian of the system , @xmath27    the unperturbed multi - particle basis states @xmath28 constructed from the single - particle states , @xmath29 , are eigenstates of @xmath30 : @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the zeroth - order energy of the state @xmath28 , and @xmath33 are the occupation numbers equal to 0 or 1 , depending on whether the state @xmath10 is occupied in @xmath34 , or not . to subtract additional symmetries",
    "only the basis states @xmath28 with a given projection of the total angular momentum @xmath35 and parity are considered .",
    "the total hamiltonian @xmath36 of the active electrons is the sum of the zeroth - order mean - field hamiltonian @xmath30 and the 2-body residual interaction @xmath37 the residual interaction @xmath38 contributes to the diagonal and off - diagonal matrix elements between the multiparticle states @xmath28 .",
    "its diagonal part shifts the energy of the basis state @xmath39 , @xmath40 the off - diagonal matrix elements @xmath41 are responsible for mixing of the multiparticle basis states .",
    "complete diagonalization of the operator @xmath42 in the space of the basis states @xmath34 yields `` exact '' energies @xmath6 and stationary states @xmath43 , @xmath44 which can be presented as superpositions of the unperturbed basis states , @xmath45    in this work we included 14 relativistic subshells @xmath46 in the single - particle basis ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath21 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 ) , and performed exact diagonalization of the @xmath54 hamiltonian matrix in a hilbert space with @xmath55 , obtained by truncating the complete set of the shell - model atomic configurations .",
    "our numerical results are obtained for the even states of ce with the total angular momentum projection set to @xmath56 .",
    "thereby , all possible states with @xmath57 from 0 to 10 are included .",
    "for the given choice of the basis the numbers of eigenstates with @xmath5810 are 343 , 917 , 1354 , 1493 , 1433 , 1153 , 826 , 497 , 262 , 107 , and 34 , respectively .",
    "the eigenvalue densities @xmath59 for @xmath608 are shown in fig .",
    "they have been window - averaged over @xmath61 a.u . to smooth out short - range fluctuations .",
    "the largest density is observed for @xmath60 , and with the exception of small regions near the ends of the spectra , all @xmath59 are proportional to each other .",
    "the shapes of the eigenvalue densities are basically determined by the corresponding basis state densities ( although the effect of level repulsion makes the former slightly wider ) .",
    "they are characterized by a very rapid increase in the low - energy part .",
    "this increase is a direct consequence of the fact that the accessible energy can be distributed in an ever greater number of ways between the 4 electrons .",
    "being essentially of combinatorial nature , the level density can be described by the exponent @xmath62 which is derived in the independent - particle model @xcite ( @xmath63 is the ground state energy ) . as seen from fig .",
    "[ j49 ] the level density from our calculation indeed follows ( [ rhoe ] ) at low energies , but then reaches its maximum and decreases @xcite .",
    "these latter features are unphysical as they are consequences of the finite size of our basis .",
    "however , within 5 ev of the ground state the configuration set we use is reasonably complete .",
    "relativistic atomic subshells @xmath46 are @xmath64-degenerate , therefore , we consider average occupation numbers @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the degeneracy of the subshell @xmath67 . in the system of a large number of weakly interacting particles",
    "thermally averaged values of @xmath68 are given by the fdd ( [ fdd ] ) .",
    "in the quantum dynamical system , like the ce atom , the occupation numbers for any eigenstate can be obtained as @xmath69 .",
    "when the number of active particles is small @xmath70 show strong level - to - level fluctuations , and it is more instructive to look at the spectrally averaged values @xmath71 where overline means averaging over the eigenstates @xmath7 within some energy interval around @xmath13 .    a typical distribution of the occupation numbers calculated at the excitation energy of 3.75 ev above the atomic ground state is shown in fig .",
    "[ nfdsp ] as a function of the single - particle energy @xmath72 of the orbitals ( see table [ param ] ) .",
    "the values of @xmath72 are determined with respect to the xe - like ce@xmath73 core .",
    "one can see that the distribution does not look at all like a monotonically decreasing fdd .",
    "a similar picture is observed over the whole energy interval from the ground state to the ionization potential .",
    "for example , the lowest even state of ce has a configuration of @xmath74 , while the fdd would tell us that all 4 electrons must be placed in the lowest @xmath52-orbital , when the energy or `` temperature '' of the system is low . in reality",
    "the @xmath75 electron configuration lies at very high energies due to a strong electron repulsion in this compact orbital ( the radius of the @xmath52 orbital in ce is at least two times smaller than that of any other valence orbital ) .    of course , considering the orbital energies @xmath72 has the drawback that they completely ignore the residual interaction between the valence electrons .",
    "when this interaction is strong one would wish to introduce some new mean - field orbital energies @xmath76 that would incorporate the effect of such interaction .",
    "the value of @xmath76 for the orbital @xmath67 will inevitably depend on the distribution of the other electrons , and hence on the excitation energy of the system . in sec .",
    "[ sec:5 ] we introduce such energies within the statistical approach .",
    "however , even when the occupation numbers are plotted against @xmath76 there is still a large deviation from the standard fdd distribution .    at first sight",
    "such a strong deviation from the fdd in a strongly interacting fermi system speaks against any possibility of a statistical description of the system . in what follows",
    "we show that the strong coulomb interaction between the electrons can be incorporated in the canonical - ensemble description of the system , and thermally averaged occupation numbers can be @xmath77 derived . as a result of the electron interaction ,",
    "the distribution of @xmath77 differs from the fdd . what is more important , we find good agreement between the results obtained by means of this statistical approach and those from the pure dynamic calculation of the ce eigenstates , @xmath78 .",
    "we also find a way to relate the energy and the temperature .",
    "in this section we show that averaging over the _ canonical distribution _ , which weighs different states according to their energies @xmath79 with probabilities @xmath80 , is very similar to averaging over the exact eigenstates @xmath43 , when these eigenstates are _ compound _",

    "the key quantity in calculating @xmath99 is the mean - squared eigenstate component @xmath100 .",
    "when @xmath84 is strong enough and the energy @xmath6 is not too close to the ground state , @xmath100 represents the spreading of the eigenstate over a large number of basis states .",
    "it is proportional to the strength function ( introduced by wigner @xcite and also known as the local density of states ) , @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the eigenvalue density .",
    "the last equality in ( [ ldos ] ) implies that some averaging over the the energy interval greater than the level spacing has been performed at @xmath103 .",

    "works a model of random two - body interactions was explored numerically and a good fermi - dirac - like behaviour of the occupation numbers was observed for as little as 4 particles distributed among 11 orbitals . however , this regime was achieved for the relatively small two - body matrix elements with mean zero and @xmath167 , where @xmath168 is the mean level spacing between the single - particle orbitals . on the other hand ,",
    "for smaller two - body interaction strengths the occupation numbers distribution was not smooth , and did not agree well with the fermi - dirac formula , because the statistical equilibrium needed was not achieved .",
    "the situation in the ce atom is different .",
    "the @xmath52 orbital has a much smaller radius than any other orbital , and the coulomb interactions have a hierarchy of scales : @xmath169 where @xmath67 and @xmath124 are orbitals other than @xmath52 .",
    "indeed , the coulomb interaction between the electrons is determined mostly by the mean radius of the largest orbital .",
    "thus , for the two orbitals @xmath67 and @xmath124 such that @xmath170 , the coulomb interaction is @xmath171 ( this formula is exact for the two electrons distributed uniformly over the surfaces of two spheres of radii @xmath172 and @xmath173 ) . because of ( [ hier ] ) the interaction term in eq .",

    "the absence of reasonably defined quasiparticle orbitals and the ensuing distortion of the fermi - dirac distribution are features outside the usual migdal theory of normal finite fermi systems ( tffs ) @xcite .",
    "its breakdown in the ce atom can be associated with the open - shell structure of the atom ( nearly degenerate `` ground state '' ) and a clear lack of symmetry of the ground state with one removed particle . as a result , single - particle excitations above the ground state do not carry good quantum numbers ( like the momentum in an infinite fermi system , or the angular momentum in a spherically symmetric finite system ) .",
    "moreover , even at low energies ( few ev ) the single - particle excitations have large widths associated with their decay into multiply excited configurations ( the spreading width @xmath174 ev @xcite ) , largely because such decay is not really limited by any selection rules ( only the trivial total angular momentum and parity are conserved ) .",
    "it has been proposed in @xcite that for finite fermi systems similar to the ce atom , characterized by the dense spectra of chaotic multiparticle eigenstates , a statistical theory alternative to the standard tffs can be developed based on the properties of these eigenstates .",
    "most importantly , the existence of the chaotic eigenstates and the equilibrium this introduces in the system is ensured by the sufficiently strong interaction between particles .",
    "this concept of the interaction - driven equilibrium is supported by our present results .",
    "we have shown that this equilibrium can be described in terms of usual statistical parameters , such as the temperature , even though some of the system s properties are very different from those usually expected in fermi systems . for example , the statistics of the occupation numbers can not be described by the fermi - dirac formula .",
    "we would like to thank m. kozlov and v. zelevinsky for useful discussions , and acknowledge support of the present work by the australian research council .",
    "consider a quantum system which consists of a number of single - particle discrete states @xmath10 ( we will also call them orbitals here ) with energies @xmath9 ( @xmath175 ) filled with @xmath176 fermi particles .",
    "the multiparticle states @xmath39 of the system are identified by specifying the occupation numbers @xmath177 or 1 of the orbital @xmath10 , @xmath178 .",
    "the total number of multiparticle states @xmath179 is quite large , even for moderate @xmath180 and @xmath3 .",

    "of course , the states @xmath39 are not eigenstates of the system .",
    "however , if the interaction between the particles is not too strong , we can use them for averaging over the canonical ensemble with probabilities @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the partition function , and the sum runs over all @xmath185 multiparticle states @xcite",

    "let us first consider the case of noninteracting particles ( @xmath192 ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the first sum is then equal to @xmath193 and the second one is @xmath194 , where @xmath195 is the set of @xmath196 orbitals obtained by discarding @xmath10 from @xmath197 .",
    "equation can then be written as @xmath198 ^{-1 } ~.\\ ] ] this equation is very similar to the fermi - dirac formula ( [ fdd ] ) , if we introduce the chemical potential @xmath16 by @xmath199 the problem is that this ratio on the left - hand side in fact depends on which orbital @xmath10 is deleted from the set @xmath200 to form @xmath201 , and so does the `` chemical potential '' @xmath16 . if we write eq .",
    "( [ fdz ] ) for @xmath202 with @xmath203 , the set @xmath204 will produce a different ratio @xmath205 , and as a result , a different value of @xmath16 .",

    "so , the difference between the values of @xmath16 for different orbitals can be probed by calculating the derivative of eq .",

    "it is obvious that the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ dermu ] ) is larger near the fermi level , @xmath212 , and is almost zero outside this interval .",

    "note that this condition means that the number of orbitals within the fermi - dirac `` step '' is large .    for the interacting particles the sum @xmath219 which gives rise to @xmath220 in eq .",
    "( [ fdz ] ) can be written as @xmath221 \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{expe } & \\times & \\exp \\left [ -\\frac{1}{t}\\left ( \\varepsilon _ \\alpha + \\sum _ { \\beta \\neq \\alpha } u_{\\alpha \\beta } n_\\beta \\right)\\right ] ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this formula the last exponent contains the energy of the particle in @xmath10 , which depends on the occupancies @xmath222 of the other orbitals . when summation over @xmath190 is carried out the exponent",

    "the result can be presented approximately as @xmath223 where we replaced the averaged exponent by the exponent containing the _ quasiparticle _ energy , @xmath224 and the mean values @xmath202 are , strictly speaking , different from those from eq .",
