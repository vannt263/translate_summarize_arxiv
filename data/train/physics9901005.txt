    "a major problem in modern physics is to understand the time evolution of a quark - gluon plasma produced following a relativistic heavy - ion collision .",
    "although a mean field theoretical approach  @xcite can provide a reasonable picture of the phase diagram of quantum field theories , such studies do not include a rescattering mechanism , which would allow an out of equilibrium system to be driven back to equilibrium .",
    "as such , the past few years have witnessed a major effort concerning the search for approximation schemes  @xcite which go beyond mean field theory . in the process",
    ", new numerical techniques were required in order to solve the ever more challenging systems of complex integro - differential equations .",
    "in this paper we revive and extend an old spectral method based on expanding the unknown function in terms of chebyshev polynomials , which plays a crucial role in implementing our non - equilibrium field theory program .",
    "finite - difference methods , though leading to sparse matrices , are notoriously slowly convergent . thus the need to use higher - order methods , like the nonuniform - grid chebyshev polynomial methods , which belong to a class of spectral numerical methods .",
    "then the resulting matrices are less sparse , but what is apparently lost in storage requirements , is regained in speed .",
    "we do in fact keep the storage needs moderate , as we can achieve very good accuracy with a moderate number of grid points .",
    "the chebyshev polynomials of the first kind of degree  @xmath1 , @xmath2 with @xmath3 , satisfy discrete orthogonality relationships on the grid of the extrema of @xmath4 .",
    "based on this property , clenshaw and curtis  @xcite proposed almost forty years ago a quadrature scheme for finding the integral of a non - singular function defined on a finite range , by expanding the integrand in a series of chebyshev polynomials and integrating this series term by term .",
    "bounds for the errors of the quadrature scheme have been discussed in @xcite and reveal that by truncating the series at some order  @xmath5 the difference between the exact expansion and the truncated series can not be bigger than the sum of the neglected expansion coefficients  @xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the chebyshev polynomials are bounded between @xmath6 , and if the expansion coefficients are rapidly decreasing , then the error is dominated by the @xmath7 term of the series , and spreads out smoothly over the interval @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "based on the discrete orthogonality relationships of the chebyshev polynomials , various methods for solving linear and nonlinear ordinary differential equations @xcite and integral differential equations @xcite were devised at about the same time and were found to have considerable advantage over finite - difference methods . since then , these methods have become standard and are part of the larger family of spectral methods   @xcite .",
    "they rely on expanding out the unknown function in a large series of chebyshev polynomials , truncating this series , substituting the approximation in the actual equation , and determining equations for the coefficients .",
    "el - gendi  @xcite has argued however , that it is better to compute directly the values of the functions rather than the chebyshev coefficients .",
    "the two approaches are formally equivalent in the sense that if we have the values of the function , the chebyshev coefficients can be calculated .",
    "in this paper we use the discrete orthogonality relationships of the chebyshev polynomials to discretize various continuous equations by reducing the study of the solutions to the hilbert space of functions defined on the set of ( n+1 ) extrema of @xmath4 , spanned by a discrete ( n+1)-term chebyshev polynomial basis . in our approach",
    "we follow closely the procedures outlined by el - gendi  @xcite for the calculation of integrals , but extend his work to the calculation of derivatives .",
    "we also show that similar procedures can be applied for a second grid given by the zeros of @xmath4 .",
    "in our presentation we shall leave out the technical details of the physics problems , and shall refer the reader to the original literature instead . also , even though our main interest regards the implementation of the chebyshev method for solving initial value problems , we present a perturbative approach for solving boundary value problems , which may be of interest for fluid dynamics applications .    the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : fundamentals ] we review the basic properties of the chebyshev polynomial and derive the general theoretical ingredients that allow us to discretize the various equations .",
    "the key element is the calculation of derivatives and integrals without explicitly calculating the chebyshev expansion coefficients . in sections  [ sec : ivp ] and",
    "[ sec : bvp ] we apply the formalism to obtain numerical solutions of initial value and boundary value problems , respectively .",
    "we accompany the general presentation with examples , and compare the solution obtained using the proposed chebyshev method with the numerical solution obtained using the finite - difference method .",
