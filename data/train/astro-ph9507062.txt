    "current laboratory , geophysical and astrophysical constraints exclude any significant evolution of most of the dimensionless physical constants over cosmological time ( sisterna & vucetich 1990 ) .",
    "however , refining these limits remains important as they provide constraints on theories such as kaluza - klein and superstrings which allow solutions in which there can be time variation of these constants .",
    "we report improved astrophysical constraints on the fine - structure constant , @xmath1  and the ratio of the electron to proton masses , ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "savedoff ( 1956 ) first pointed out the possibility of using differential measurements of redshifted lines in cosmologically distant objects to test the evolution of certain of the dimensionless physical constants ; since then various measurements have been outlined and the observational constraints greatly improved .",
    "recent summaries of these astrophysical measurements may be found in potekhin & varshalovich ( 1994 ) and levshakov ( 1994 ) . in this paper",
    "we describe the use of extremely high signal - to - noise and high resolution ( @xmath14  to 47,000 ) spectra of quasar absorption lines obtained with the keck 10  m telescope to tighten the evolutionary constraints on @xmath1 , ( @xmath9 ) and ( @xmath15 ) by roughly an order of magnitude over previous measurements .",
    "note that , in translating limits to time variation rates we have assumed a flat cosmology ( @xmath13 , @xmath16 ) with a hubble constant of @xmath17 .",
    "the presence of cosmological evolution in ( @xmath9 ) can be tested by using observations of molecular hydrogen in quasar absorption line systems , assuming that all other dimensional constants , particularly the fine - structure constant , do not vary in such a way as to compensate for the variation in ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "this was first pointed out by thompson ( 1975 ) , who noted the different dependence of the electronic , vibrational and rotational energy levels on ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "there is , however , a general unavailability of data at high redshift : to date , only one quasar , pks  @xmath18 , is believed to have molecular hydrogen in its spectrum , at a redshift of 2.811 ( chaffee , foltz & black 1988 ) .",
    "varshalovich and levshakov ( 1993 ) have analyzed this data to obtain a @xmath19  limit of @xmath20 , assuming a time difference of @xmath21  between @xmath22  and @xmath23 .",
    "we have re - observed pks  @xmath18  at much higher spectral resolution ( @xmath24 ) and signal - to - noise , obtaining a 5.4  hour spectrum with the keck telescope which unambiguously confirms chaffee et al.s identification of molecular hydrogen , as demonstrated in fig .  1 which shows the 00 and 40 bands of the lyman series .",
    "an analysis of the physical properties of the molecular hydrogen itself is given elsewhere ( songaila & cowie 1995 ) .",
    "table  1 summarises the properties of those lines that are isolated molecular hydrogen lines , based on their measured column densities and fwhm . in the born - oppenheimer approximation",
    ", the molecular hydrogen energy levels can be written , @xmath25 so , the energy shift in any vibration - rotation transition @xmath26  in the lyman series has the form , @xmath27 and the difference in energy between two transitions is , @xmath28 to lowest order , a change in @xmath29  induces a change in @xmath30  such that @xmath31 where @xmath32  is the mean offset compared to the laboratory value , of the energy difference between the two sets of lines , when that offset is represented as a velocity difference .",
    "while the above description is in fact adequate for the analysis and gives a clear insight into the method , we have in practice used the exact relationship , @xmath33 where the @xmath34  coefficients have been tabulated by varshalovich & levshakov ( 1993 ) .    a regression analysis based on the data of table  1 then gives a best fit value @xmath35  and a 95% confidence range of @xmath36  to @xmath37 .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "velocity spread is @xmath38 . for our ` standard ' cosmology , the time to @xmath22  is @xmath39  and our 95% confidence limit for @xmath40  is @xmath41  to @xmath42 .",
    "this is approximately an order of magnitude improvement over the previous result .",
    "the separation between the wavelength ( @xmath43 ) corresponding to the transition @xmath44  and that ( @xmath45 ) corresponding to the transition @xmath46  in an alkaline ion is proportional to @xmath47  to lowest order in @xmath1  ( bethe & salpeter 1977 ) .",
    "writing @xmath48 , @xmath49 so any change in @xmath1  will result in a corresponding change in @xmath50  in the separation of the doublets in a high-@xmath51  quasar ( as was first used by bahcall & salpeter [ 1965 ] and wolfe , brown & roberts [ 1976 ] ) @xmath52 @xmath53 the most recent analyses using this method ( potekhin & varshalovich 1994 ) have used very large inhomogeneous samples of c  iv , n  v , o  vi , mg  ii , al  iii and si  iv doublets and obtained a 95% confidence limit of @xmath54 .",
    "we have improved this analysis using a homogeneous sample of doublets observed at high spectral reolution . however , before proceeding further , it is important to note that , for a given accuracy in determining @xmath55 , the sensitivity of determining @xmath56  is inversely proportional to the relative splitting of the doublet @xmath57 . for this reason , si  iv , the most widely spaced of the doublets ( @xmath58 ; toresson 1960 ) is by far the most sensitive probe of @xmath1 , followed by al  iii and mg  ii .",
    "we have therefore restricted our analysis to the si  iv doublet . choosing a doublet with large",
    "@xmath59  also alleviates a second problem , namely that , for many of these doublets , the laboratory wavelength separation is not known to very high precision .",
    "this enters directly in the @xmath60  term as a systematic uncertainty which is minimised for large @xmath61 . for si",
    "iv , martin and zalubas ( 1983 ) estimate the uncertainty in toresson s ( 1960 ) wavelengths at a maximum of @xmath62 , which , if adopted as an extreme upper bound to the uncertainty in the doublet spacing , translates into an uncertainty of @xmath63  in @xmath64 , and currently imposes a fundamental limit of @xmath65  on the accuracy to which @xmath66  can be determined .",
    "we have identified a number of si  iv doublets in high-@xmath51  quasar absorption - line systems observed with the keck hires spectrograph at @xmath24 .",
    "the redshift systems used in the analysis were seen not only in si  iv but also in lines of other species , such as c  iv and ly  @xmath1 ; therefore , the identifications do not depend solely on the spacing of the si  iv lines .",
    "table  2 lists the relative velocity shifts for si  iv . as is illustrated in fig .  2 ,",
    "the offsets have been measured by cross - correlating the two members of the doublet .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "uncertainty in this procedure is @xmath67 , determined from measurements of the more common c  iv doublet .",
    "the 95% confidence limits inferred from table  2 are @xmath68 , comparable to the systematic error from the uncertainty in the laboratory wavelengths . combining the two errors in quadrature , we have @xmath69  and our results imply @xmath70 , a factor of 5 lower than potekhin and varshalovich s ( 1994 ) result .",
    "further improvements will require either new laboratory determinations of the si  iv doublet separation , or local observations of the si  iv doublet spacing in the nearby interstellar and intergalactic gas .",
    "the later can be carried out by the spectrographs on the hubble space telescope . to be useful for this purpose , high resolution measurements with the goddard high resolution spectrograph would be required .",
    "current published values are not adequate .",
    "the ratio of the frequencies of the hyperfine 21  cm absorption transition of neutral hydrogen ( @xmath71 ) to an optical resonance transition ( @xmath72 ) has the dependence @xmath73 so that evolution of this quantity will result in a difference in the measured redshifts of 21  cm and optical absorption @xmath74 the current best limits on this quantity are given by tubbs and wolfe ( 1980 ) , who found @xmath75  for absorption in the quasar q1331 + 170 .",
    "the redshift of the hyperfine absorption in q1331 + 170 is known to very high precision ( @xmath76 ; wolfe & davis 1979 ) and the uncertainty in the tubbs and wolfe ( 1980 ) estimate arises primarily in the imprecision of the optical redshift .",
    "recently , songaila et al .  ( 1994 ) have presented high s / n observations of @xmath6  absorption and fine - structure @xmath6 , finding @xmath77 .",
    "because the @xmath6  arises in the same cloud components responsible for the 21  cm absorption , the comparison of @xmath78  and @xmath79  should be relatively secure against different kinematic structures being present in the two measurements .",
    "combining the two redshifts , we find @xmath80 corresponding to a 95% confidence range for @xmath81  of @xmath82  for our standard cosmology .",
    "the three constraints presented here can be compared with existing laboratory and astrophysical constraints .",
    "the limits on @xmath2  currently constitute the tightest astrophysical constraint on the evolution of these dimensionless parameters , implying @xmath83  and @xmath84  at the 95% confidence level , in the absence of relative cancellation . for @xmath85 ,",
    "the astrophysical measurement is now comparable to the best local tests ( sisterna & vucetich 1990 ) , which give @xmath86  ( 95% confidence ) , but , because of the larger timeline , may provide more stringent constraints on models with non - linear evolution of @xmath1 .",
