    ", it allows us to explore the high energy physics by means of inflation .",
    "one of the most important prediction is that it also provides vacuum fluctuations of gravitons , called primordial gravitational waves ( gws ) , whose amplitude is directly related to the energy scale of inflation in the standard scenario .",
    "we can search for the imprint of primordial gravitational waves on the polarization of cmb b - mode , conventionally parameterized by the tensor - to - scalar ratio  @xmath0 .",
    "unfortunately , however , we have not yet detected this signal and recent bicep2/keck array collaboration has reported the following upper bound on its amplitude  @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "moreover , due to the decreasing of hubble parameter during inflation , its scale dependence is always red .",
    "therefore , it is also getting harder to detect it in future gravitational wave experiments .",
    "in fact , for the practically testable gw amplitude the space - based interferometers such as decigo ( not ultimate decigo ) and bbo project require  @xmath2  in the case of a standard inflationary model @xcite .    from the theoretical point of view",
    ", however , there is a room to suppose another source of metric tensor modes based on the fundamental theory . in superstring theory",
    ", there is a plentitude of pseudo - scalar fields , called string axions , which arise from the compactification of the extra - dimensional manifold @xcite .",
    "it is known that the string axion is one of the best motivated candidate of the inflaton due to its shift symmetry at perturbative level , which protects the flatness of the potential from the radiative correction of other coupled matters @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , the rolling axion amplifies one helicity mode of the gauge field via its chern - simons interaction , so that the enhanced gauge field could provide the parity - violating tensor spectrum , in both cases of the abelian gauge field and the non - abelian gauge field @xcite .",
    "furthermore , due to the increasing of the velocity of axion , its amplitude is naturally blue - tilted and becomes sizable higher than frequency range of cmb scales .",
    "the main motivation of this study is to search for the axion phenomenology through chiral primordial gravitational waves sourced by the axion - gauge coupling , which is potentially testable by future space - based gravitational wave experiments or pulsar timing arrays .    in recent studies @xcite",
    ", it was shown that for an observable gw amplitude a preferable range of axion decay constant is around gut scales , remarkably which is naturally predicted by the low energy supergravity of the string theory @xcite . motivated by this result , in this paper we explore the novel feature of blue tensor spectrum produced by the string compactifications . in the context of the dimensional reduction of string theory",
    ", two types of axion - like particle generally appear as the zero mode of kalza - klein expansion of the form field , traditionally called the  model - independent axion \" and the  model - dependent axion \" .",
    "both of them couple with the gauge field through the anomaly cancellation mechanism in ten - dimentional theory .",
    "however , the way of coupling to gauge fields is different between these axions : the model - independent axion acquires the gauge interaction from the kinetic term of the form field , while that of the model - dependent axion derives from the one - loop green - schwarz counter terms of gauge anomalies . as a result ,",
    "the sign combination of the coupled chern - simons terms are generally different between these axions .",
    "therefore , the opposite helicities of gauge fields each other could play an important role if these couplings are effective during inflation .",
    "inspired by this property , in this work we suggests the possibility of generating blue tensor spectra ( not  spectrum \" !",
    ") sourced by two gauge groups coupled to these two types of axion . in the conventional scenario , in order to get a sizable tensor spectrum in small scales its parity must be almost totally violated because only one polarization mode of gauge field is amplified during inflation .",
    "we find that , however , if these two axions play a role of inflaton , the different polarization modes of each gauge group coupled to two axions grow up and could provide totally parity - conserved or slightly parity - violated blue tensor spectra , both of which add completely new features to the axion phenomenology in early universe .",
    "remarkably whose amplitudes and chiralities are potentially testable with future space - based interferometer decigo or bbo project .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ setup ] , we derive two types of axion and their form of gauge couplings from the dimensional reduction of the form field . in section [ model ] , we build the concrete inflationary models where two types of axion occur inflation coupled to different sign combination of abelian gauge sectors , which are generally included in the original two gauge groups .",
    "then in this section we describe the time evolution of tensor power spectra numerically .",
    "simultaneously , we also check the production of the inflaton perturbation sourced by gauge fields and show that the power spectrum of curvature perturbation is consistent with the non - detection of primordial black holes ( pbhs ) during inflation .",
    "the final section is devoted to conclusion and discussion .",

    ", however , we should also take care of the amplification of curvature perturbation , leading to the overproduction of pbhs in small scales .",

    "in this paper , we studied the new feature of generating primordial blue tensor spectra from the inflationary axion - gauge interactions , whose coupling forms are inspired by the dimensional reduction of string theory . in the string theory , axions arise from the compactifications of the form fields , which couple with the gauge field in order to cancel the gauge anomaly in ten dimension .",
    "the important property is that there are two types of axion , dubbed the model - independent axion and the model - dependent axion , which acquire the different sign combination of the coupled gauge groups through the generalized green - schwarz mechanism .",
    "considering this fact , we constructed the inflationary models where the model - independent or the model - dependent axion plays a role of inflaton , both of which couple with abelian gauge fields with same or opposite signs each other .",

    "in the case where only the model - dependent axion plays a role of an inflaton , the totally parity - conserved tensor power spectra could be provided .",
    "this prediction is completely different from the previous results since a sizable amplitude of tensor power spectrum is totally parity - violated in small scales . on the other hand ,",
    "when both types of axion play a role of an inflaton , we developed the possibility of generating the blue tensor spectra whose chirality is parameterized by the hierarchy of their decay constants .",
    "as an example , we described the dynamics of generating tensor power spectrum in the case of a cosine - type potential and found that the provided blue tensor spectra with slightly parity - violated have the possibility to detect the future gravitational wave experiments such as decigo or bbo project .",
    "as to the dynamics of scalar curvature perturbation , we checked the time evolution of its two correlation function and showed that it safely avoids the overproduction of pbhs in small scales . in this work , however , we have not estimated the motion of the inflaton with back - reaction of gauge fields self - consistently so that the careful treatment of the evolution of curvature perturbation will be actually needed near the end of inflation where back - reaction is strongly dominated @xcite .",
    "it would be instructive to consider how unique our prediction is .",
    "it seems that similar results could appear when two axions couple with the gauge fields with the same signs and roll down on their potentials in an opposite direction each other . in this case , however , we will need fine - tuning for each parameter of axion s velocity or the number of gauge fields to realize our result because in the equation of motion for each gauge field the  @xmath134  parameter is not in common .",
    "in addition to that , there is another mechanism of generating chiral primordial gravitational waves @xcite , so it is worth to consider whether we can discriminate between these theories through the observation of parity - violated tensor spectrum .",
    "moreover , it is intriguing to study the case where axions play a role of spectator fields during inflation .",
    "we expect that in this case the similar result of this work would be also realized .",
    "finally , in this work we search for the dynamics of abelian gauge fields for simplicity and neglect the effect of higher interaction terms of non - abelian gauge fields .",
    "hence , it will be important to explore the dynamics of axions coupled to non - abelian gauge sectors during inflation .",

    "we firstly solve the equation of motion for the gauge field in a homogeneous background , assuming that back - reaction on the inhomogeneous perturbation is negligible .",
    "it is given by @xmath212 where the prime means the derivative with respect to  @xmath78  and  @xmath213  is a background inflaton field . in order to describe the production of quanta of gauge fields ,",
    "we promote the classical field  @xmath214  to an operator expansion @xmath215 where  @xmath216  are annihilation and creation quantum operators which obey the following commutation relation  @xmath217 = \\delta_{\\lambda\\lambda'}(2\\pi)^3\\delta^3(\\bm{k } + \\bm{k } ' ) \\ .",

    "since the time variation of  @xmath134  is slow - roll suppressed , we can approximate it as a constant . for our convenience ,",
    "we choose  @xmath134  as a positive value .",

    "we are interested in the parameter region  @xmath228 , so that around the horizon - crossing the gauge field can be substantially approximated as the following real value @xmath229 in the following time interval  @xmath230 .",
    "it is enhanced by a factor  @xmath91  and this amplification affects the production of tensor and scalar perturbations . in the super - horizon regime",
    "@xmath231 , the enhanced mode  @xmath226  settles in a constant value  @xmath232 , so the energy density of gauge fields dilutes due to the expansion of the universe .",
    "thus , in the region  @xmath230  the gauge field makes the most contribution to the physical enhancement of fluctuations .",
    "the enhancement of gauge field could also affect the background dynamics .",
    "for the friedmann equation and the equation of motion for the axion  @xmath233 , they read @xmath234 @xmath235 where we defined the electric and magnetic components of the gauge field as @xmath236 in above equations , we introduce the back - reaction effect of the amplification of gauge field .",
    "they are given by @xmath237 where  @xmath238  and we assume that the uv - divergence of the vacuum mode at  @xmath239  is renormalized away .",
    "note that we can extend the integration of  @xmath240  to the super - horizon limit since it is actually a good approximation of the exact solution . at large  @xmath134",

    "let us analyze the two - point correlation function of  @xmath109 .",
    "firstly , in we can approximate  @xmath256  in the integration since the most contribution part of the integration comes from the enhancement of  @xmath257  around horizon - crossing , so we ignore the terms in the third line of .",
    "then after renormalization of uv part , we can reduce the integration of time interval to the region where the particle production of the gauge field takes place . therefore , rewriting  @xmath109  in  @xmath258  we can find @xmath259 where we denoted a numerical factor @xmath260 ^ 2 \\label{eq : fxi } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath261  and we used the following relationship  @xmath262  in above expressions . although we used the approximate solution to the whole integrand of the correlation function , this simplification could be justified because the region where both amplifications of gauge fields  @xmath263  are maximal is the most dominant contribution to the integration and furthermore we can extend  @xmath264  from  @xmath265  to  @xmath266  since has most of its support at  @xmath267 . in this calculation , we set  @xmath268  and  @xmath269  which corresponds to the following polarization vector @xmath270 then for large  @xmath134 , we can write @xmath271 we can see that  @xmath272  is larger than  @xmath273  by a factor  @xmath274 .",
    "this numerical discrepancy comes from the suppression factors  @xmath275  in the integration .",

    "<S> we suggest the new feature of primordial gravitational waves sourced by the axion - gauge couplings , whose forms are motivated by the dimensional reduction of the form field in the string theory . in our inflationary model , as an inflaton we adopt two types of axion , dubbed the model - independent axion and the model - dependent axion , which couple with two gauge groups with different sign combination each other . due to these forms </S>",
    "<S> both polarization modes of gauge fields are amplified and enhance both helicies of tensor modes during inflation . </S>",
    "<S> we point out the possibility that a primordial blue - tilted tensor power spectra with small chirality are provided by the combination of these axion - gauge couplings , intriguingly both amplitudes and chirality are potentially testable by future space - based gravitational wave interferometers such as decigo and bbo project . </S>"
