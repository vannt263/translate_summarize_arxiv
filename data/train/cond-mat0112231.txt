    "when light passes through a fluid , correlations over space and time in the density fluctuations are responsible for the scattering of light . in fact , the dynamic structure factor @xmath0 , which is the space - time fourier transform of the space - time correlations of density fluctuations in the fluid@xcite , reflects the strength of the exchanges of energy and momentum between a light beam and the fluid as a function of wavevector @xmath1 and frequency @xmath2 . for a one - component newtonian fluid in equilibrium",
    ", the theory for @xmath0 was first given correctly in 1934 by landau and placzek@xcite and later rederived using fluctuating hydrodynamics@xcite and the approach advocated by mountain @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "in fluctuating hydrodynamics , random fluxes are added to the hydrodynamic equations ( linearized about equilibrium ) which then appear as stochastic equations of the langevin type .",
    "the fluctuation - dissipation theorem provides a connection between the spectrum of spontaneous fluctuations in thermal equilibrium and the transport properties of the system .",
    "in contrast , the dynamic structure factor in mountain s work is derived directly from the linearized hydrodynamic equations without resorting to any kind of fluctuating term added to the constitutive equations .",
    "it is worthwhile to note here that both routes lead to the same results and that these results have been confirmed many times by light scattering measurements in various systems .    for nonequilibrium fluctuations in newtonian fluids ,",
    "the theory was developed rather more recently@xcite - @xcite and the few available experiments seem also to confirm its validity@xcite-@xcite .",
    "the extension of fluctuating hydrodynamics to steady states is made on the basis of the simple hypothesis that the fast degrees of freedom behave as `` if they were in local equilibrium at the value of the thermodynamic parameters determined from the solution to the steady state problem '' @xcite . with this statement",
    "it is assumed that the statistics of the stochastic forces behaves as if they were within a local equilibrium environment around each point * r * of the system @xcite .",
    "it is usual under this hypothesis to rewrite the correlation functions of the stochastic fluxes by substituting the equilibrium thermodynamic properties and transport coefficients by their space dependent values .",
    "another way to see this assumption is based on the markov property : the random fluxes are not affected by the applied gradients since the correlation length is of microscopic order @xcite .",
    "studies of fluctuations in non - newtonian fluids are also relatively abundant . some of these systems have also been described under the scope of linear langevin approaches , as is the case of viscoelastic fluids near equilibrium states @xcite , suspensions in viscoelastic fluids under density and velocity gradients @xcite and colloidal suspensions including memory effects @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , there are many treatments _  la mountain _ in this kind of fluids as well @xcite - @xcite . among these , although at the time meant in a different context , we want to mention here explicitly the study of ( equilibrium ) rayleigh - brillouin scattering in polyatomic fluids within an extended irreversible thermodynamic treatment @xcite carried out by lpez de haro , rodrguez and garca - coln a few years ago @xcite . there , no explicit emphasis on the non - newtonian character of the fluid was made , although of course the evolution equations for the trace and the symmetric traceless part of the stress tensor clearly imply this character .",
    "more recently , vzquez and lpez de haro@xcite have shown the equivalence of the computation of the equilibrium dynamic structure factor of a maxwell fluid both using fluctuating hydrodynamics and mountain s approach .",
    "it is a major aim of the present paper to profit from the results of these previous works and to generalize them to the case where the fluid is subjected to an external temperature gradient .",
    "the idea is to assess to what extent non - newtonian effects , which have been considered negligible in actual experiments , do affect the light - scattering spectrum .",

    "iii  deals with the same fluid which has now been brought to a steady state by the action of an externally imposed temperature gradient . here",

    "iv  with a discussion and some concluding remarks .",

    "a noteworthy feature is that the asymmetry in the brillouin peaks , related to the fact that there are more sound waves absorbed with wavevector @xmath174 than those emitted with wavevector @xmath1 due to the temperature gradient and its corresponding heat flux is much more pronounced and the peaks become narrower for the viscoelastic fluid . on the other hand , within the various approximations and simplifying asumptions that we made , the mountain peak is not affected by the temperature gradient .",
    "this , which is somewhat surprising and most likely tied to the assumption @xmath158 , is a trivial consequence of the fact that the nonequilibrium correction vanishes for @xmath68 .    in conclusion ,",
    "we want to point out that we have derived ( to our knowledge for the first time ) the light - scattering spectrum for a maxwell fluid in a steady state under the action of an external temperature gradient .",
    "although many ( reasonable ) approximations , some of which might be easily disposed of , were made along the way in order to get analytical results , and in spite of the fact that the maxwell fluid is a very simple model of a viscoelastic fluid , we are persuaded that the present calculation captures the essential ( qualitative ) features to be observed in light - scattering experiments in connection with the elasticity of fluids . whether this expectation is real awaits the necessary confrontation with experiment .",
