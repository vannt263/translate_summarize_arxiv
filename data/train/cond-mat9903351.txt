    "resonant inelastic light scattering has become a very useful tool to study quantum dot ( qd ) excitations@xcite .",
    "it had been extensively employed before to study electron single - layers and quantum wires in semiconductor heterostructures ( see for example refs . ) , and currently it is also being applied to study electron multi - layers@xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to refs . for a review of this experimental technique .",
    "a major advantage of resonant inelastic light scattering over far infrared ( fir ) optical absorption techniques used in the past@xcite is that the former allows to disentangle and identify , using polarization selection rules in the backwards geometry@xcite , charge density ( cde ) , spin density ( sde ) and single - particle ( spe ) electron excitations in the same sample , whereas fir absorption is only sensitive to charge density excitations . in inelastic light scattering , when the polarizations of the incoming and scattered photon are parallel ( polarized geometry ) cde s are observed , whereas when the polarizations are perpendicular ( depolarized geometry ) sde s dominate the spectrum .",
    "this is due to the structure of the scattering cross section , which besides the charge or spin electronic strength function contains the scalar or vector product of the photon polarizations , respectively@xcite . yet ,",
    "cde s are seen with some intensity in the depolarized spectrum@xcite .",
    "spe s are mostly detected under conditions of extreme resonance , whereas cde s and sde s can be observed at incident photon energies far above the effective band gap@xcite .",
    "this helps disentangle sde s from spe s , which are in the same energy range at small spin magnetizations .    for a qd in the @xmath0 plane submitted to a static magnetic field @xmath1 in the @xmath2 direction ,",
    "sde s may involve electronic spin - flips or not .",
    "the later excitations are referred to as longitudinal sde s , and the former as transverse sde s .",
    "this means that sde s are caused by one - electron excitation operators of the kind    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the @xmath2 component of the spin of the dot , and @xmath5 is the @xmath2 component of the pauli matrix vector .",
    "@xmath6 are the spin - flip operators    @xmath7    due to rotational invariance in spin space , longitudinal and transverse sde s are degenerated at @xmath8 if @xmath9 in the ground state ( gs ) .",
    "when the magnetic field is not zero , rotational invariance is broken by the zeeman term .",
    "then if the gs is almost paramagnetic , i.e. @xmath10 as it occurs at even filling factors @xmath11 , the sde s are expected to split in a simple way :    @xmath12    where the superscript @xmath13 indicates the longitudinal(transverse ) character of the mode , and the subscript @xmath14 corresponds to the two possible spin flip transitions .",
    "@xmath15 is the effective gyromagnetic factor and @xmath16 is the bohr magneton .",
    "a thorough discussion of longitudinal dipole sde s in quantum dots within time - dependent local - spin density theory ( tdlsdt ) has been presented in refs . .",
    "if the gs has a large @xmath4 , i.e. a large spin magnetization ( ferromagnetic gs ) , as it happens at odd filling factors @xmath11 , eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) no longer holds and longitudinal and transverse sde s display dramatic differences arising from the spin dependence of the electron - hole ( e - h ) vertex corrections .    to study transverse dipole spin modes we have resorted to current density functional theory ( cdft)@xcite together with its time - dependent version ( tdcdft)@xcite . for the physics we aim to describe here , local - spin density theory ( lsdt ) and cdft sensibly yield the same results .",
    "cdft is expected to be more reliable than lsdt at high magnetic fields@xcite , but the residual interaction in the longitudinal spin channel is very cumbersome to work out within tdcdft .",
    "for this reason , whenever we have had to work out the longitudinal spin response for the sake of comparison with the transverse one , we have resorted to tdlsdt .",
    "we will see that the spin dipole response is dominated by the transverse component , especially for filling factors smaller than 2 . in the following",
    "we shall use the terms density functional theory ( dft ) and time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) when the statement applies to either version of the general method .",
    "the spin and density response of the two dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) has been thoroughly studied by kallin and halperin@xcite and macdonald@xcite . as these authors",
    ", we have mainly addressed the response of quantum dots corresponding to integer filling factor gs s .",
    "we have considered only three cases whose ground state is the finite size analogue of a partially filled 2deg configuration between @xmath11 = 1 and 2 .",
    "one should regard these results as qualitative , since the corresponding ground states are believed to be very complicated , strongly correlated ones , and the use of tddft to describe them may be questioned .",
    "nonetheless , these results display the gross trends of the excitation spectrum , and for that reason we have considered them here .",
    "we have taken as a case of study a circularly symmetric qd of radius @xmath17 164 nm made of @xmath18 electrons in a gaas - algaas heterostructure .",
    "the gs of this dot has been described in detail in ref . .",
    "throughout this work , we shall be using effective atomic units , whose definition and value for gaas can be found for example in that reference .",
    "a major advantage of considering a rather large qd for the present discussion is that several integer filling factor gs configurations can be identified as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "this allows to discuss the influence of the paramagnetic or ferromagnetic character of the gs on the excitation spectrum .",
    "the large number of relatively close single particle ( sp ) levels that one has to handle to obtain the gs and strength functions poses some technical problems , and is the token to pay for microscopically study large qd . in this work we have used a small temperature @xmath19 k. this facilitates the calculations while it does not introduce any appreciable thermal effect in the results .    in the following we limit the analysis to the most interesting dipole mode , for which the @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is @xmath21 .",
    "furthermore , to take advantage of the imposed circular symmetry , we have considered as dipole operators the following ones :    @xmath22    as well as the combinations : @xmath23 where the subscript @xmath24 represents the orbital angular momentum carried by the excitation , each one corresponding to a different kind of left- or right - circularly polarized light . within tddft ,",
    "the external probe represented by these operators has also a harmonic time dependence of frequency @xmath25 .",
    "the method we have used to obtain the spin response has been described in ref . for the transverse case , and in refs . for the longitudinal one , so we do not need to repeat it here .",
    "we want to recall that the mean field entering the kohn - sham ( ks ) equations changes due to the dynamical spin magnetization induced by the external field . within tddft",
    ", it is assumed that electrons respond as free particles to the sum of the external plus induced field , which leads to a dyson - type integral equation for the correlation function @xmath26    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the free electron correlation function and @xmath29 is the residual e - h interaction . from @xmath26 it",
    "is possible to obtain the induced spin magnetization corresponding to any of the above excitation operators and then determine the dynamical polarizability function @xmath30 .",
    "finally , the strength function @xmath31 is obtained from the imaginary part of the dynamical polarizability function as @xmath32 $ ] .",

    "@xmath53 has been constructed as indicated in ref . .",
    "within cdft , the ks equations are more cumbersome to write down @xcite .",
    "still , they have a similar structure , and what one has to keep in mind for the discussions that follow is the existence of an exchange - correlation potential which plays the role of @xmath54 , and another exchange - correlation potential which plays the role of @xmath55 in the above equation .",
    "one should be aware that the residual e - h interaction may change drastically the picture extracted from the uncorrelated e - h excitations . yet , as a useful guide for the discussion , we collect in fig .",

    "the filling factor @xmath11 does represent the number of occupied landau bands , each one labeled as @xmath60 or @xmath61 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , upright full triangles represent @xmath62 sp states , and downright , empty triangles , @xmath63 sp states .",
    "the horizontal lines represent the electron chemical potential .",
    "all the occupied bands are shown , but to build the valence space of sp states for calculating the correlation functions we have usually considered more empty states than those shown in the figure .",
    "it is worth to notice the small energy difference between the @xmath60 and @xmath61 bands for even @xmath11 values @xmath64 , which has its origin in the zeeman term , as compared to the large energy difference between the same bands if @xmath11 is odd , even if the applied @xmath1 is relatively small ; compare for instance the @xmath11 = 7 and 6 cases .",
    "that difference in ferromagnetic gs s mostly comes from the spin - dependent exchange - correlation potential @xmath65 , which is zero or very small in paramagnetic gs s , and sizeable in ferromagnetic gs s , largely overcoming the zeeman energy .",
    "hartree - fock ( hf)@xcite and lsdt or cdft@xcite yield such large gaps , whereas the hartree approximation does not .",
    "the role of electron - electron interactions in producing these gaps when @xmath11 is odd has been stressed in ref . .",
    "we are going to see that the effect of the gap is paramount on the transverse spin response .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the strength function @xmath31 ( solid lines ) corresponding to @xmath66 . for the sake of clarity",
    ", we have decomposed @xmath66 into its @xmath36 and @xmath67 components , which are drawn in figs [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] respectively .",
    "the associated free responses , i.e. spe s , are represented by dashed lines .",
    "the functions are given in effective atomic units , and the frequencies in mev .",
    "let us first comment on the results corresponding to paramagnetic gs s in which both spin up and down sp states have a tendency to be equally populated yielding a small @xmath4 value .",
    "as a consequence , the attractive e - h residual interaction is weak , and sde s and spe s lie in the same energy range . in both @xmath36 and @xmath67 components",
    ", the strength displays a high energy structure with a frequency always close to the free strength ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) , and a low energy structure . for paramagnetic gs s ,",
    "the low energy excitation is a _ transverse spin edge mode _ built from e - h pairs near the fermi level .",
    "these pairs can be easily identified in fig .",
    "1(a ) and ( b ) , as they are at the intersection of the chemical potential with the landau bands . the sp band structure also explains why the edge mode is more fragmented at low magnetic fields .",
    "for example , at @xmath11 = 8 four e - h pairs , each one involving quite different sp orbital angular momenta from the other pairs , are contributing to the @xmath67 strength , whereas only one pair is contributing at @xmath11 = 2 .",
    "these pairs are weakly correlated among them and the result is an edge mode fourfold fragmented at @xmath11 = 8 , threefold fragmented at @xmath11 = 6 , and so on . this nicely corresponds to the number of crossings of the fermi level with the @xmath68 bands in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    in the case of @xmath36 ,",
    "the edge mode is less fragmented because some spin - flip e - h transitions having @xmath69 are pauli blocked by our arbitrary election of @xmath1 in the positive direction of the @xmath2 axis ( we recall that one has to have @xmath70 , which can not always be fulfilled simultaneously with the spin and edge conditions ) .",
    "the lacking of the edge state in the @xmath11 = 4 case is due to the particular sp structure around the fermi level at @xmath1 = 2.57 t. this accidental fact has no relevance for the general discussion .    as anticipated , the e - h residual interaction produces a dramatic effect when the gs is ferromagnetic . even for moderately intense magnetic fields ,",
    "the transverse spin mode emerges in these gs s as a very collective , undamped excitation whose energy we will see in the next subsection depends little on the size of the dot provided it is of the present size or larger .",
    "this is somehow the analogous of kohn s theorem@xcite for charge density excitations in a qd parabolically confined , and it has the same physical origin , namely , the exact ( or nearly exact in the spin case ) cancelation between the bare and induced e - h interactions .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] that when the dot is fully polarized at @xmath11 = 1 , @xmath36 no longer excites it because of pauli blocking . even at @xmath11 = 3 ( @xmath1 = 3.43 t ) , its strength is very small . on the contrary",
    ", the excitation produced by @xmath67 displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] is appreciably redshifted from the free response .",
    "the difference between both situations reveals the strength of vertex corrections arising from exchange - correlation terms of the electron - electron interaction , which within tddft@xcite are the only ones contributing to dress the free e - h vertex in the spin channel .",
    "this effect is more sizeable at @xmath11 = 1 when the system is fully polarized .",
    "the low energy peak excited by @xmath67 is taking almost all the dipole strength , as we will show later .",
    "low energy sde s in ferromagnetic gs s caused either by @xmath36 or @xmath67 _ are not edge , but bulk spin excitations_. again , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] helps understanding this . for these odd @xmath11",
    "gs s , the fermi level is between the @xmath71 and @xmath72 landau bands , the former being occupied and the later empty .",
    "although finite size effects distort the bands at the edge of the dot which is formed by sp states with high @xmath56 values , it is clear that low energy spin - flip transitions involve sp states whose energy difference is precisely the energy difference between the @xmath73 bands",
    ". these excitations also occur in the bulk ( 2deg ) .",
    "the role of the residual interaction is clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] comparing the free and tdcdft strength functions at @xmath11=5 and at @xmath11 = 3 , for example .",
    "one sees that the spe energies have nothing to do with the low sde energy thus , any free e - h model will be of little help to quantitatively analyze sde s in partially polarized qd , the situation worsening the higher the polarization .",
    "we present in figure [ fig5 ] a more detailed picture of the spin excitation in the transverse channel at high @xmath1 , showing the strength function of @xmath66 in the @xmath74 region . as in previous figures ,",
    "the dashed lines represent the free response . in this range of filling factors , which corresponds to 5.14 t @xmath75 t",
    ", we have found@xcite that the @xmath76 value steadily increases@xcite from zero to 210 , so the @xmath66 strength is essentially that of @xmath67 already discussed . the interesting new feature in fig . [ fig5 ]",
    "is the structure of the high frequency peaks .",
    "they are two orders of magnitude less intense than the low energy ones , which thus exhaust most of the strength . of the high energy peaks ,",
    "the higher ones are excited by @xmath67 , and the lower ones by @xmath36 ( obviously , high energy transitions caused by @xmath36 are blocked only when the system is fully polarized ) .",
    "it can be seen that these high energy peaks are little collective , as spe s and sde s are quite similar , and also that the centroid of the @xmath36 and @xmath67 peaks roughly follows the same evolution with @xmath1 as the cyclotron frequency @xmath77 does .",
    "the value of @xmath78 is indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] by vertical arrows .",
    "when both high energy peaks are clearly visible in the strength , as for example at @xmath1 = 7 t , their splitting is a quantitative measure of the spin - dependent exchange - correlation gap @xmath55 , and its measurement may be the spectroscopic complement to experimental gap determinations based on the temperature dependence of the conductivity@xcite .",
    "this is so because @xmath79 is directly related to the energy difference of the @xmath60 and @xmath61 bands around the fermi level , see eq .",
    "( [ eq101 ] ) . as the sets of `` parallel '' bands @xmath80 and",
    "@xmath68 have the same `` width '' as fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] indicates , the splitting between the high energy peaks would be twice the energy difference between the @xmath71 and @xmath72 bands .",
    "this is nicely confirmed in the @xmath1 = 7 and 9 t cases , for which an explicit comparison is possible ( see fig .",
    "5 of ref . ) .",
    "we recall that this comparison is meaningful because of the weak effect of the residual interaction on the high energy peaks .",
    "the longitudinal high energy peak for these configurations lies@xcite at @xmath81 ( see also fig .",

    "figure [ fig6 ] shows the longitudinal ( @xmath38 ) and transverse ( @xmath66 ) dipole spin strength functions as dotted and solid lines , respectively .",
    "it can be seen that in ferromagnetic states , the strength is dominated by the transverse modes .",
    "one should also notice that for @xmath83 , i.e. low @xmath1 , apart from some fine structure the longitudinal and transverse spin responses have their main peaks at quite similar energies .    the paramagnetic configuration at @xmath11 = 2 ( @xmath1 = 5.14 t ) shows the interesting situation in which a zero spin gs sustains the simple result anticipated at the introduction : the transverse modes are just shifted by the zeeman energy from the longitudinal ones .",
    "interestingly too , the low energy @xmath36 mode has almost collapsed .",
    "this suggests the presence of instabilities in this particular transverse channel , similar to those found in the longitudinal spin channel in the @xmath84 region@xcite .",
    "when the system is fully polarized , the longitudinal spin and charge density strengths trivially coincide and of the spin modes , only the transverse one has a sense@xcite .",
    "the connection between the peak and zeeman energies will be discussed in the next subsection .",

    "their result can be exactly recovered in the sr approach if one uses the same valence space and accordingly , the projection of @xmath135 onto the @xmath86 = 0 space@xcite .",
    "this is the so - called single mode approximation ( sma)@xcite , equivalent to the approach of ref . in the fully polarized case .",
    "it is easy to seize the effect of the @xmath138 bands on the low energy collective mode within tdcdft .",
    "it suffices to compute the response limiting the sp valence space to the @xmath139 bands . in this case",
    ", only the low energy peak appears in the @xmath67 strength function , and its energy @xmath140 mev is denoted by a cross in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "the inclusion of the high energy bands changes the energy of the transverse sde in @xmath141 10 % .",
    "we have also determined that the high energy peaks in the @xmath67 strength contribute around 20 % to @xmath98 .",
    "in this work we have thoroughly studied the transverse dipole spin response in quantum dots . together with our previous works@xcite ,",
    "they provide a detailed account of the applicability of time - dependent density functional theory to the description of the dipole response of qd in the charge and spin channels . although microscopic descriptions of similar complexity exist since some time ago for the charge density modes in medium size qd@xcite , the spin density modes in qd had not been previously addressed . besides",
    ", we have been able to apply the theory to rather large dots , similar in size to those investigated in present experiments@xcite    among sde s , the transverse ones are especially relevant ; in the longitudinal channel , the residual interaction is fairly weak , and the sde s are landau damped as they are close to the spe s ( actually , the same happens with the transverse modes at low @xmath1 ) . in the transverse channel ,",
    "when the dot has a sizeable magnetization the position of sde s is shifted away from the spe s by exchange - correlation vertex corrections arising from electron - electron interactions . as a consequence , a very collective , dispersionless sde emerges . at large spin magnetization ,",
    "pauli s principle plays a prominent role , blocking the @xmath36 component of the transverse strength function , which becomes simpler .",
    "the possibility of carrying the calculations in a large dot displaying several integer quantum hall gs s has permitted us to disclose the sensitivity of the transverse response to the applied @xmath1 , which appears as a strong energy oscillation with @xmath1 , and a nearly collapsed low energy @xmath36 mode at the @xmath11 = 2 paramagnetic gs .",
    "the energy oscillations are also consequence of the different strength of vertex corrections in ferromagnetic and paramagnetic gs s .",
    "we have also derived two model independent sum rules that , on the one hand , can be used as a control for the analysis of the experimental data , and on the other hand , have allowed us to relate our results at full magnetization to previous works on 2deg .",
