    "the current paradigm for the electronic structure of manganites ( a@xmath0b@xmath7mno@xmath2 ) with x @xmath8 1/2 is a lattice of mn sites with d@xmath9 or d@xmath10 orbital occupancy , with the proportion of each decided by the value of x and orbital ordering ( oo ) of the occupied e@xmath11 orbital on d@xmath10 sites .",
    "the corresponding double - exchange model hamiltonian has been studied extensively @xcite .",

    "mn magnetic moments are in the range 3.8 to 3.9 @xmath4 for either compound while oxygen ions within the polarons have charges closer to o@xmath3 than o@xmath13 and magnetic moments of -0.7 @xmath4 .",
    "all other oxygen ions are essentially o@xmath13 ions .",
    "each polaron has a net magnetic moment of 7.0 @xmath4 , in good agreement with recently reported magnetisation measurements from electron holography and fresnel imaging@xcite .",
    "uhf calculations predict that magnetic coupling within polarons is strong and ferromagnetic ( fm ) while coupling between polarons is much weaker and can be antiferromagnetic ( af ) or fm ; these observations lead to a natural explanation for the observed ce or a - type af magnetic ground states of manganites with x = 1/2 @xcite and the magnetic ground state of la@xmath16ca@xmath15mno@xmath2 , which contains polarons with the magnetic moment roughly aligned along the polaron axis @xcite .",
    "given that the magnetic coupling within the polarons is strong and fm , the appropriate model hamiltonian for these systems at low temperature is a heisenberg hamiltonian on a triangular lattice where each polaron is a single magnetic entity , rather than the conventional double exchange hamiltonian .",
    "results of uhf our calculations are at odds with density functional theory ( dft ) calculations in the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) reported recently @xcite and with lsda calculations done as part of this work using the same electronic structure code @xcite in that uhf calculations predict a magnetic moment on oxygen ions within the polarons whereas dft calculations do not .",

    "uhf calculations predict a net magnetic moment of 7.0 @xmath4 for the polaron , i.e. the polarons are fully spin polarised , in agreement with these measurements of the magnetisation of fm domains @xcite .",
    "earlier neutron scattering data for this compound ( table [ tab : tab1 ] ) indicated magnetic moments somewhat smaller than these fully polarised values @xcite but the trend , where larger moments are found on the sites denoted mn@xmath18 , is reproduced .",
    "mulliken populations from uhf calculations on la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 indicate total mn ion populations in the range 2.25 ( x = 0 ) to 2.13 ( x = 1 ) with a monotonic variation for intermediate values of x. mn d populations have an even smaller relative variation across the range of x with a d population of 4.66 in lamno@xmath2 , a range of d populations from 4.72 to 4.73 in la@xmath12ca@xmath12mno@xmath2 , and 4.70 in camno@xmath2 .",
    "this is consistent with a bonding picture in which the t@xmath19 shell on each mn ion is half - filled and a pair of e@xmath11 orbitals is combined with a set of four empty sp@xmath9 orbitals to form a set of equivalent d@xmath20sp@xmath9 octahedral hybrid orbitals for polar - covalent mn - o bonding .",
    "the consistency of both the mn ion population and d population across the range of values of x contradicts the conventional double exchange picture where mn ions are assumed to have their formal mn@xmath18 and mn@xmath21 charges .",
    "total energies were calculated for the fm state and four different low energy af states of the x = 1/2 compound .",
    "low energy states are found by flipping entire polaron magnetic moments ; flipping the spin of one of the mn ions in a polaron results in an increase of the total energy by around 400 mev .",

    "however , in similar uhf calculations on lamno@xmath2 @xcite , it was found that af couplings are significantly underestimated compared to either experiment or results of configuration interaction ( ci ) cluster calculations , whereas fm couplings are in better agreement with both .",
    "the polaronic picture for manganites with x @xmath8 1/2 which has been presented is consistent with a wide range of experimental data and allows various observations , such as the unusual magnetisation in la@xmath16ca@xmath15mno@xmath2 , to be explained : it accounts for the observation of a - af or ce - af ground states for various combinations of counterion in a@xmath12b@xmath12mno@xmath2 @xcite ; it is consistent with full spin polarisation of mn ions in la@xmath12ca@xmath12mno@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "one must be cautious in using uhf calculations to estimate magnitudes of magnetic moments on the oxygen ions .",
    "an analogy can be drawn between electron transfer from the o ion in a polaron to a neighbouring mn ion and separation of the electron pair in a hydrogen molecule as the proton - proton distance is increased above the molecular equilibrium bond length : uhf wave functions for hydrogen molecules at large bond distances consist of a spin - up electron on one proton and an spin - down electron on the other ; the additional configuration in which spins on protons have been exchanged is omitted , owing to the simple functional form of the wave function .",
    "uhf ( and lsda ) wave functions incorporate strong electron correlation effects at the cost of a proper treatment of electron spin .",
    "spin symmetry is restored in ci methods , but these can only be applied to finite clusters owing to the large number of electronic configurations encountered in that approach .",
    "ci calculations on the pair of mno@xmath27 octahedra in the polaron in la@xmath12ca@xmath12mno@xmath2 show that the overall spin configuration is a linear combination of several determinants @xcite with a magnetic moment on the central oxygen ion .",
    "the la@xmath12ca@xmath12mno@xmath2 polaron electronic structure therefore resembles that in @xmath28-nav@xmath29o@xmath30 @xcite ; it is unlike the electronic structure which results in fm coupling in lamno@xmath2 , which is very well described by a single spin configuration @xcite .",
    "an obvious question which arises within the polaron picture is , what happens when electrons are added to the x = 1/2 phase? that is , what is the electronic structure predicted to be in the fm region of the phase diagram with 0.2 @xmath31 x @xmath31 0.5? since the bottom of the conduction band in la@xmath12ca@xmath12mno@xmath2 is comprised largely of vacant oxygen 2p states on the o@xmath3 ion in the polaron , one would naturally expect to add the extra electron here . the spin density plots in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] and [ fig : fig4 ] show that oo in the x = 1/2 compounds is _ parallel _ to the polaron axis , whereas it is t - shaped in lamno@xmath2 ( long mn - o bonds in jt distorted octahedra in lamno@xmath2 are _ perpendicular _ to each other ) .",
    "if the extra electron is added to the polaronic oxygen site , it is expected that there will be reorientation of e@xmath11 orbitals ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]c ) and adjustment of mn - o - mn bond lengths .",
