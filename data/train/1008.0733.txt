    "work on quantum electrodynamic processes at magnetic flux densities of the order of the critical field @xmath0 g has been reviewed recently , and very completely , by harding & lai ( 2006 ) .",
    "the processes concerned are primarily those relevant to collisions within plasma at low altitudes above the surface of a neutron star and therefore do not include relativistic coulomb bremsstrahlung and pair creation in the interaction of electrons and photons with ions .",
    "there appear to be no published cross - sections for these processes at @xmath1 apart from a number of papers on the bremsstrahlung energy - loss of non - relativistic electrons .",
    "but of these , only lieu ( 1981 ) and lauer et al ( 1983 ) have treated bremsstrahlung as a process of second order in the electron - photon coupling and the work of the latter authors is also limited to collisions in which both initial and final electrons are in the lowest landau state .",
    "bussard ( 1980 ) and langer ( 1981 ) have considered photon production in non - relativistic electron - ion plasma collisions but have treated it as a sequence of first - order processes , that is , coulomb excitation of a higher landau state followed by cyclotron emission .",
    "however , the reverse flux of electrons or positrons produced by pair creation in the open magnetic flux - line region above neutron - star polar caps must produce electromagnetic showers in the condensed matter at the surface whose properties are determined by the relativistic second - order processes . in neutron stars with spin @xmath2 such that @xmath3 , the outward particle flux consists of electrons so that nuclear reactions within the positron - initiated showers have no obvious observable effect .",
    "but in the opposite case , @xmath4 , the outward particle flux is positively charged and , with positrons , also includes protons that are produced in the shower and diffuse to the surface .",
    "it is likely that the temporal behaviour of these different components does lead to instabilities that are the basis of observable phenomena ( jones 2010 ) . in general",
    ", there appears to be no reason a priori why both @xmath5 cases should not be present in the neutron - star population and it is of interest to understand how each might be observed in the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "estimates of shower development in previous work relied on the correspondence principle , that for large values of the landau quantum number the zero - field cross - sections are valid , but this is unlikely to be satisfactory at @xmath1 where the number of contributing landau states can be small .",
    "the present paper attempts to give cross - sections that are rather better than order - of - magnitude estimates but are not of high accuracy owing to the discrete nature of the landau spectrum and to truncations that are made in performing the calculations .",
    "its purpose is to see whether and in what way the cross - sections differ qualitatively from those at zero field .",
    "nucleon production in electromagnetic showers occurs almost entirely through formation and decay of the giant dipole resonance .",
    "thus the paper is concerned , particularly , with factors that influence the low - energy photon track length and its depth distribution .    with neglect of radiative corrections and of the anomalous magnetic moment , the energy states of an electron in a uniform magnetic field are @xmath6 in which @xmath7 is the longitudinal momentum component , parallel with @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the landau quantum number .",
    "apart from the appendix and where explicitly stated otherwise , momentum and energy are here expressed in units of @xmath10 and @xmath11 ; the magnetic flux density @xmath12 is in units of @xmath13 . in electron - photon interactions ,",
    "the conserved quantities are energy and the longitudinal momentum component .",
    "thus the kinematic behaviour of an electron is that of a particle confined to one dimension and of mass @xmath14 in which we have defined , purely for ease of notation , a notional transverse momentum component @xmath15 .",
    "we have adopted the solutions of the dirac equation found by johnson & lippmann ( 1949 ) and give a summary of calculational details in the appendix .",
    "these are unremarkable except that owing to the one - dimensional kinematics of electrons and the small number of landau states that contribute significantly at @xmath16 , we have found it convenient , given that numerical computation must be involved , not to proceed with the usual approach of covariant formalism and green functions but instead to write down the transition matrix to second order directly in terms of time - ordered matrix elements calculated using an explicit representation of the dirac matrices .",
    "it is also appropriate to mention here that the states given by equation ( 1 ) are two - fold degenerate for @xmath17 only if radiative level shifts , natural widths , and the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron are neglected .",
    "but for the high - energy spin - averaged or summed processes considered here , the fine structure is of no consequence and we use only the completeness of the johnson - lippmann eigenfunctions .",
    "references and some further details are given in the appendix .",
    "the most simple problem here is that of finding the replacement for rutherford s scattering formula .",
    "small - angle coulomb scattering in the zero - field case is replaced at @xmath1 by the coulomb excitation of landau states .",
    "this has been treated by bussard ( 1980 ) and langer ( 1981 ) but only in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "the relativistic cross - sections that we require appear not to have been published previously and are given in section 2 .",
    "there have been many calculations of transition rates for cyclotron emission , and a summary is contained in the review of harding & lai ( 2006 ) .",
    "new transition rates are given in section 3 to allow comparison with previous work and , more specifically , to obtain the distribution of photon transverse momentum @xmath18 from the decay of @xmath19 landau states which is of crucial importance in the development of electromagnetic showers at @xmath1 .",
    "cross - sections for coulomb pair creation and bremsstrahlung are obtained in sections 4 and 5 . in the case of pair creation , there appears to be no previously published work . for bremsstrahlung ,",
    "the work of lieu ( 1981 ) and lauer et al ( 1983 ) is in the non - relativistic limit so that comparison is not possible .",
    "there is also the further problem that calculations relying on truncation of the number of landau states lack external tests of their correctness because the zero - field limit is not available .",
    "but where minor tests of correctness exist , we find that they are satisfied .",
    "finally , with primary electron energies of the order of @xmath20 gev and the high condensed matter densities predicted at the neutron star surface , it is essential to consider the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal effect and its influence on coulomb pair creation and bremsstrahlung cross - sections . its existence and broad properties at zero field have been verified through experiments at particle accelerators .",
    "we refer , in particular , to the recent work of hansen et al ( 2004 ) and to the review of klein ( 1999 ) . we find that the effect exists at @xmath1 and that the one - dimensional electron kinematics makes possible",
    "a particularly simple treatment which is given in section 6 .",
    "the cross - section calculations of sections 4 & 5 have been repeated with allowance for the lpm effect which is shown to significantly change early shower development .",
    "the final section gives a qualitative summary of the cross - sections obtained and of the effect of magnetic fields of the order of the critical field on shower development .",
    "small - angle coulomb scattering at zero field , in which the transverse momentum component is a continuous variable , is replaced by a landau transition @xmath21 with longitudinal moment transfer @xmath22 .",
    "free atoms in high magnetic fields have an axially symmetric but complex electron density distribution .",
    "but the departures from uniform electron density in condensed matter are not large except for a small number of inner orbitals and we therefore adopt the potential @xmath23 of a point charge within a spherical wigner - seitz unit cell of uniform electron density .",
    "its radius is @xmath24 obtained from the ion number density calculated by medin & lai ( 2006 ) for atomic number @xmath25 .",
    "calculational details are summarized in the appendix .",
    "the symmetry of @xmath26 indicates that landau functions in cylindrical polar coordinates are the appropriate choice .",
    "the quantum number @xmath27 denotes the spatial degeneracy of these states and the procedure is to average the transition rate over all @xmath27 in the range @xmath28 .",
    "each state has a guiding centre radius @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the cyclotron radius .",
    "the incident flux is then @xmath31 divided by @xmath32 , and the cross - section at incident momentum @xmath33 , with no spin - flip , is the limit @xmath34 of , @xmath35 arising from equation ( a3 ) and from the axial symmetry of @xmath26 .",
    "spin - flip cross - sections are smaller by a factor of the order of @xmath36 relative to unity and as our interest is primarily in electrons with @xmath37 they have not been calculated .",
    "the range of initial - state quantum numbers @xmath27 should be so large that the cross - section is independent of @xmath38 in the case of an isolated atom .",
    "we have confirmed that , for @xmath39 , this condition is satisfied adequately for @xmath40 at which value guiding centres are at radii approaching the wigner - seitz cell radius .",
    "numerical cross - sections @xmath41 are given in table 1 , for @xmath42 .",
    "they are in units of @xmath43 @xmath44 and are for @xmath45 and longitudinal momentum @xmath46 , but are almost exactly independent of @xmath7 .",
    "calculation to the lowest order in @xmath26 is satisfactory here , as for the zero - field small - angle rutherford formula , owing to the pole in the amplitude at zero momentum transfer .",
    "thus the cross - sections are linear in @xmath47 .",
    "the cross - sections of table 1 are valid in the relativistic limit of @xmath48 so that comparison with the near - threshold cross - sections found by bussard ( 1980 ) and langer ( 1981 ) is not possible .",
    "but the standard rutherford cross - section at small angles can be expressed in terms of a continuous variable @xmath49 through the correspondence principle relation @xmath50 .",
    "it is @xmath51 bn . the numerical values and dependences on @xmath49 and @xmath12 are quite close to those given in the table for an initial state with @xmath52 .",
    "the @xmath53 cross - sections are well - defined by equation ( 3 ) even though they are to an evanescent state whose asymptotic final form with @xmath54 is indistinguishable from the unscattered .",
    "these @xmath55 transitions to virtual states of finite @xmath22 appear in the calculation of second - order processes , in particular bremsstrahlung and pair creation cross - sections , and in condensed matter are relevant to the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal effect considered in section 6 .",
    "the cross - sections in table 1 are typically two orders of magnitude larger than those we obtain for coulomb bremsstrahlung in section 5 .",
    "thus rutherford scattering excites higher landau states whose decay is an important source of photons , particularly in the later stages of shower development .",
    "we shall refer to this in greater detail in section 7 .",
    ".cross - sections in units of @xmath56 @xmath44 for coulomb - induced landau transitions @xmath21 , with @xmath42 , are almost exactly independent of longitudinal momentum at @xmath57 but have been calculated for electrons of @xmath58 mc incident on an isolated neutral atom of atomic number @xmath45 .",
    "the magnetic flux density in the first column is in units of @xmath59 g. the significance of the @xmath53 transitions is considered in the text and later in section 6 . [",
    "cols=\"<,<,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in both this and previous work , we have adopted expressions for the zero - pressure ion number density , @xmath60 and for the interatomic separation in a linear chain , parallel with @xmath8 , @xmath61 conveniently summarizing the calculated values of medin & lai ( 2006 ) .",
    "we anticipate that the bremsstrahlung and pair creation cross - sections obtained in previous sections for isolated atoms will be considerably modified in the condensed matter of the neutron - star surface .",
    "in particular , it is essential to consider the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect , whose existence at zero field has been established without doubt by experiments with laboratory electron beams of several hundred gev ( hansen et al 2004 ) .",
    "the essence of the effect is that , for example in bremsstrahlung and at high energies , the isolated - atom longitudinal coherence length ( of the order of @xmath62 ) can be so long that the coherence that would be present in the case of an isolated atom is partially removed by multiple scattering of the initial or final - state electron within the medium .",
    "we refer to the review by klein ( 1999 ) for further details , and for a discussion of other processes in condensed matter , such as the dielectric effect , that are not relevant here . in the present section ,",
    "we examine the lpm effect at high magnetic fields and find that the one - dimensional nature of kinematics at @xmath1 allows a particularly simple description .",
    "we begin by considering the effect of scattering of an electron with initial longitudinal momentum @xmath63 by a ( dimensionless ) potential @xmath64 whose origin is at @xmath65 .",
    "we consider transitions with no change of landau quantum number so that the final state is given by the green function , @xmath66 constructed from the landau functions given by equation ( a3 ) .",
    "the truncation to @xmath55 is possible because , as we found in section 2 , the @xmath67 transition rates are at least an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "it also excludes spin - flip and back - scattering @xmath68 which are both negligible in the present context .",
    "the scattered state is @xmath69 in which @xmath70 is the matrix element of @xmath71 between states @xmath7 and @xmath72 , and @xmath73 is infinitesimal .",
    "it is reached by introducing the integral representation of the heaviside function @xmath74 , followed by integration over @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "equation ( 17 ) shows that the electron has components of momentum @xmath77 and that these are significant at distances @xmath78 .",
    "either by performing the integral , or taking the limit @xmath79 , we can see that the prefactor outside the brackets evolves to an amplitude @xmath80 , as expected .",
    "apart from the forward - scattered component of the wave - function given by equation ( 17 ) , flux conservation shows that there is also an undisturbed component of amplitude @xmath81 .",
    "equation ( 17 ) , giving the forward - scattered state , is no more than a concrete expression of the uncertainty principle , but it shows that forward scattering by a sequence of atoms , though unobservable in the motion of the electron itself , has the effect of broadening the distribution of @xmath22 and so reducing the small-@xmath22 amplitudes that mediate most of the bremsstrahlung cross - section at high energies .",
    "the simplicity of equation ( 17 ) enables us to find the green function for an electron undergoing a sequence of forward scatters and so provides an easy way to calculate bremsstrahlung cross sections including the lpm effect .",
    "we begin by noting that the distribution in the variable @xmath22 in equation ( 17 ) is unchanged in form by multiple forward scattering as is shown by the amplitude for a second and successive scattering at @xmath82 , @xmath83 in which @xmath84 .",
    "we assume that the properties of @xmath85 allow the limits of integration to be extended to @xmath86 with completion of the contour in the upper half of the complex-@xmath87 plane .",
    "we see that the amplitude has the spatial dependence @xmath88 of the last scattering .",
    "consequently , the amplitude for an electron propagating without back - scattering or @xmath67 transitions in a long interval of @xmath89 must be a superposition of @xmath22-distributions , each of the form of equation ( 17 ) , with components which are necessarily identical except that their individual amplitudes decay exponentially as functions of @xmath88 , reflecting a reduction factor @xmath90 for each atom traversed .",
    "this exponential representation is satisfactory provided the mean square value of @xmath91 , satisfies the condition @xmath92 , as it does here .",
    "therefore , we can find the green function that couples the electron to a final state of total longitudinal momentum @xmath93 .",
    "it is given by , @xmath94 in which @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the mean interatomic separation @xmath97 and we have integrated first over @xmath89 and then over @xmath22 by completion of the contour in the semi - infinite upper half of the complex @xmath22-plane . the right - hand side of equation ( 19 ) contains , within brackets , the momentum - space green function for an electron propagating without back - scattering , spin - flip or @xmath67 transitions .",
    "forming the square modulus of the remaining term ( and neglecting any inhomogeneity in the @xmath98 ) yields the ( one - dimensional ) static structure function for a linear chain of @xmath99 atoms , @xmath100 which contains , as a function of @xmath101 , the dependence of the transition rate on the condensed - matter structure . allowance for transitions with change of landau quantum number should not be difficult but is not essential because , as can be seen from the table 1 cross - sections , their mean free path is considerably longer than @xmath102 .",
    "pair production and bremsstrahlung cross - sections including the lpm effect are obtained immediately , assuming a random distribution of atoms defined by a structure function @xmath103 , simply by substituting this green function for the energy denominators contained in equations ( 8) or ( 11 ) .",
    "we have done so and have repeated the calculations by which the table 3 and 4 cross - sections were obtained .",
    "the revised cross - sections given in the lower sectors of these tables are for @xmath45 and require some comment .    in the case of pair production ,",
    "the re - calculated cross - sections are given in table 3 just for @xmath39 and show that , owing to the very high matter density ( @xmath104 g @xmath105 ) the lpm effect becomes noticeable at @xmath106 and reduces cross - sections by more than an order of magnitude at @xmath107 .",
    "however , its effect on bremsstrahlung is less simple .",
    "the re - calculated cross - sections in table 4 show that there is an initial increase at low values of @xmath7 .",
    "the explanation for this is as follows . for fixed values of the kinematic variables and quantum numbers ,",
    "there is a partial cancellation of the two terms in equation ( 11 ) which arises because the energy denominators are almost exactly equal in magnitude ( @xmath108 ) but have opposite signs .",
    "the presence of @xmath109 in the modified green function creates a further amplitude term in which this cancellation is not present , so producing the cross - section increase .",
    "but with increasing @xmath7 , values of @xmath22 decline and eventually the @xmath109 component of the denominator becomes dominant .",
    "its effect becomes marked for @xmath110 mc .    the presence of the lpm effect removes the simple @xmath47 scaling of cross - sections , but equations ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) allow us to see that @xmath111 , with @xmath112 .",
    "thus for a fixed magnetic field , cross - sections become asymptotically dependent on @xmath113 in the high - energy limit .    but",
    "the possibility that zero - pressure neutron - star matter has some degree of one - dimensional order must also be considered .",
    "formation of one - dimensional chains of atoms of homogeneous @xmath25 , oriented parallel with the magnetic flux , is energetically favoured at @xmath16 ( see medin & lai 2006 ) and such structure may be present at the surface to the extent that it survives the formation of the approximately poisson distribution of nuclear charge produced by photodisintegration reactions in the reverse - electron electromagnetic showers .",
    "its effect can be studied simply by reference to the structure factor given by equation ( 21 ) neglecting , for the moment , any inhomogeneity in atomic number .",
    "consider , for example , the structure function for a finite linear chain of @xmath99 homogeneous atoms with spacing @xmath114 , @xmath115 this has maxima , @xmath116 , when @xmath22 coincides with an integral multiple of the basic reciprocal - lattice wavenumber @xmath117 , but has zeros at @xmath118 .",
    "its effect is primarily to significantly distort spectral shapes given by isolated - atom differential cross - sections .",
    "unfortunately , it is not easy to be specific about changes in total cross - sections because they are dependent on the ( unknown ) structure function and on all other parameters , but with a change of variable in a particular differential cross - section to @xmath22 we can note that the modified total cross - section is , @xmath119 taken over the complete interval of @xmath22 for the process , and that this differs from the @xmath120 cross - section by a factor of order unity , not @xmath99 .",
    "the cross - sections obtained here are those that , with compton scattering , determine electromagnetic shower development . for magnetic flux densities of the order of @xmath121 g , landau quantum numbers @xmath122 are associated with transverse momenta @xmath123 .",
    "thus , on the basis of the correspondence principle , zero - field expressions are used with some degree of confidence .",
    "but in many neutron stars , fields more than two orders of magnitude larger have been inferred from the observed spin - down rate .",
    "for this reason , it is necessary to be aware of any field - dependence of these cross - sections that would qualitatively change the nature of shower development . in this respect ,",
    "the processes that appear not to have been considered previously are those of sections 2 , 4 and 5 . of these , rutherford scattering merits",
    "little comment except to note that its cross - section decreases with increasing magnetic field in the region @xmath1 .",
    "pair creation is a little more complex because the amplitude ( equation 8) becomes singular at the threshold values of @xmath18 for magnetic pair creation , beyond which it becomes no more than a coulomb field - dependent correction to that process .",
    "thus we are concerned with the cross - section for @xmath18 below the first two thresholds discussed following equation ( 6 ) in section 3 .",
    "this is the explanation for the intervals of @xmath18 adopted for columns 3 - 5 of table 3 .",
    "bremsstrahlung at @xmath1 is an even more complex process .",
    "it is of second order in the coupling of the electron with the electromagnetic field , as at zero field .",
    "but there are two significant differences .",
    "the table 4 cross - sections are for an electron initially in the @xmath52 landau ground state , but in the development of a shower in condensed matter , higher-@xmath49 states are certainly populated owing to the very large rutherford cross - sections listed in table 1 . secondly , a pole in the amplitude ( equation 11 ) for such initial states represents the possibility of real intermediate states of @xmath124 .",
    "the process we refer to as bremsstrahlung then consists of two separate first - order processes ; rutherford scattering followed by cyclotron emission with the natural widths given in table 2 .",
    "the initial electron momentum determines whether or not this is more important than the second - order process .",
    "an estimate of the critical value is easily made from the cyclotron emission rates in table 2 which are all of the order of @xmath125 .",
    "although the mean free path @xmath126 for rutherford scattering is always small compared with the radiation length @xmath127 which is characteristic of the second - order bremsstrahlung process , time dilation can extend the mean flight path @xmath128 for natural decay by cyclotron emission to lengths greater than @xmath127 .",
    "then the first - order processes are the dominant source of photon production provided the initial - state momentum is , @xmath129 from the transition rates given in table 2 and the values of @xmath130 given in table 4 , we can see that its value is not strongly @xmath12-dependent .",
    "specifically , for @xmath39 , @xmath45 , @xmath131 bn and @xmath132 cm with inclusion of the lpm effect , so that for @xmath133 , the inequality ( 23 ) becomes @xmath134 mc . at lower momenta , the process of bremsstrahlung becomes simply a sequence of excitation ( or de - excitation ) of higher-@xmath49 landau states by rutherford scattering and de - excitation by cyclotron emission . at even lower momenta , the balance between excitation and de - excitation changes and the typical values of the landau quantum number decrease until for @xmath135 , that is , for @xmath136 they are @xmath137 . with the cross - section @xmath138 from table 1",
    ", we find @xmath139 cm .",
    "the transition rate @xmath140 gives @xmath141 mc .    the above summary of the properties of the bremsstrahlung and pair creation processes at high magnetic fields serves to show qualitatively how the characteristics of electromagnetic showers differ from the zero - field case . in the initial stages of an electron - initiated shower of about @xmath20 gev",
    ", the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect is far more effective in reducing cross - sections owing to the very high density of the condensed matter at the neutron star surface .",
    "therefore , shower development is displaced inward until typical electron or photon energies are reduced to the extent that the effect becomes unimportant . at this stage ,",
    "electron energy loss becomes rapid , occurring within lengths much shorter than @xmath127 .",
    "photon mean free paths are dependent on @xmath18 , but below the lowest threshold for magnetic pair creation at @xmath142 they are a little larger than the value of given by the zero - field bethe - heitler cross - section .",
    "the principal interest in shower development here is in proton production by decay of the nuclear giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) .",
    "cross - sections for its electro - production are small so that the important shower property is the distribution of total photon track length in the neighbourhood of the resonant momentum , @xmath143 mc .",
    "an estimate of this , made under the assumptions that bremsstrahlung occurs through the sequence of first - order processes decribed above and that the bethe - heitler pair creation cross - section is valid , was given by jones ( 2010 ) .",
    "we have found that shower development at @xmath1 is more complex than was assumed in that work , the important question being the fraction of photon production in the gdr region that has transverse momentum below the magnetic pair creation thresholds at @xmath144 for landau quantum numbers @xmath145 and @xmath146 for @xmath147 with @xmath148 .",
    "it is significant that cyclotron decay , which is dominant in the later stages of shower development , always leads to a decrease in landau quantum number , so bringing about a convergence of the shower toward small @xmath18 .",
    "the only qualification here is the tendency , noted by harding & lai ( 2006 ) and confirmed in table 2 , for partial transition rates direct to the ground state @xmath52 to be large at @xmath149 .",
    "complete and quantitative calculations of shower development would require an expansion of tables 1 , 2 and 4 to much larger initial - electron values of the landau quantum number , and a monte carlo calculation using them would be a substantial undertaking which has not been attempted here .",
    "qualitatively , we can conclude that the photon track length distribution assumed in previous work is valid at @xmath150 .",
    "for very high fields at @xmath149 , the pair creation cross - sections become small and the photon mean free path at transverse momenta below magnetic pair creation thresholds are then determined by compton scattering . therefore , we expect that the effect of the large cyclotron partial transition rates to @xmath52 will begin to reduce total photon track length in the gdr region of momentum at @xmath149 .    99 baring m. g. , gonthier p. l. , harding a. k. , 2005 , apj , 630 , 430 bussard r. w. , 1980 , apj , 237 , 970 hansen h. d. , uggerhoj u. i. , biino c. , bellestrero s. , mangiarotti a. , sona p. , ketel t. j. , vilakazi z. z. , 2004 , phys .",

    ". the distinction would be important if spin - polarized electron or positron states were being considered .",
    "however , for the cross - sections obtained here , which are for relativistic energies , lepton spin - polarization is not of interest and the fine - structure in energy levels can be safely neglected . in this paper",
    ", we always average or sum over lepton spin states so that we require only the completeness of the johnson - lippmann states .",
    "these , with the negative energy solutions given by the transformation @xmath160 , have been used explicitly in sections 2 - 5 .",
    "the corresponding representation of the dirac matrices is easily found from equations ( 47)-(54 ) of johnson & lippmann and is @xmath161 the subscript @xmath162 labelling the spinors indicates that for the case @xmath52 , or in the limit @xmath163 , they are also eigenstates of @xmath164 with eigenvalues as indicated . the functions @xmath165 are a complete orthonormal set of eigenfunctions of @xmath166 labelled by the landau quantum number @xmath49 .",
    "their relative phases are not arbitrary because they are required to satisfy the conditions , @xmath167 where @xmath168 and b is the magnetic flux density in units of @xmath13 .",
    "the atomic coulomb potential has axial symmetry , reflecting the shape of the electron orbitals in the magnetic field .",
    "( we neglect any small component with a lattice symmetry . )",
    "thus cylindrical polar coordinates @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath89 , with @xmath8 parallel with the @xmath171 appear to be the optimum .",
    "the functions are then , @xmath172 conveniently expressed in terms of the variable @xmath173 , where @xmath174 is the cyclotron radius",
    ". the landau quantum number can be any positive integer @xmath175 and all except the @xmath52 state are two - fold degenerate .",
    "in addition , the quantum number @xmath27 represents the infinite spatial degeneracy of all landau states whose guiding centres can be at radii @xmath29 from the z - axis .",
    "the polynomials @xmath176 are , @xmath177 in obvious sequence and they satisfy , @xmath178 which is worth noting in relation to states with @xmath179 .",
    "we adopt gaussian cgs units so that the fine structure constant is @xmath180 .",
    "perturbations of the correct sign are introduced into equation ( a1 ) by modifying the energy - momentum four - vector , @xmath181 and @xmath182 , to include the radiation field @xmath183 and the atomic coulomb potential for nuclear charge @xmath25 .",
    "thus the absorption of a photon with wave - vector @xmath184 and angular frequency @xmath185 is represented by the matrix element of @xmath186 in which @xmath187 is the polarization vector either parallel with , or perpendicular to , the vector @xmath188 .",
    "the creation of a pair in states specified by @xmath189 , as in lines three and six of equation ( 8) , is given by the matrix element @xmath190 in which the positron energy is @xmath191 .",
    "evaluation of this proceeds by matrix multiplication and immediately yields , for each set of values of @xmath192 and of photon polarization , a linear combination of terms each of which , apart from kinematic factors , contains an integral of the form , @xmath193 these expressions , and the integrals contained in them , have all been evaluated numerically .",
    "therefore , we are unable to give useful analytical expressions for any of the cross - sections calculated in this work .",
    "evaluation is the more tedious because the transverse dipole approximation is not adequate so that there is no radiative transition selection rule that is effective for physically significant values of @xmath18 .",
    "but matrix elements of the coulomb potential satisfy @xmath194 strictly for isolated atoms ; also in condensed matter to the extent that components with the symmetry of the crystalline field are small ."
