    "the liberalization of electricity market caused that modeling on this market became very important skill .",
    "it helps us to minimize loss and hedge our position .",
    "it is a very interesting fact that spread option could be used for valuation some real assets as power plants or transmission lines .",
    "but before that we need to know the spread option price formula .",
    "very popular model used for option valuation is the geometric brownian motion model but it is not very efficient . in the 2005 the idea of modeling domestic electricity market using interest rate model",
    "was introduced by hinz , grafenstein , verschue and wilhelm @xcite .",
    "they valuated european call option written on power forward contract under heath jarrow morton model and , in this way , created very interesting class of models .",
    "the aim of my work is the valuation and calibration of electricity spread option under interest rate model applied for electricity market .",
    "i start with assumption of vasicek model and using martingale methodology @xcite valuate spread option . using the maximum likelihood function methodology",
    "i estimate model parameters .",
    "i compare constructed model with geometric brownian motion model by applying both models to real option valuation .",
    "i make simulations to show the difference between to discussed models .",
    "my paper is organized in the following way . at the beginning ( section 2 )",
    "i describe what does it mean that we bought a spread option , next ( section 3 ) i introduce the reader into real options world . in section 4",
    "i describe valuation methodology for spread option under interest rate model and present also option price formula for geometric brownian motion model .",
    "the calibration methods for both models are described in section 5 . at the end , in section 6",
    ", all theoretical deliberation are confronted with real data and some simulation results are presented .",
    "in this section two interesting cross commodity derivatives on electricity market are described .",
    "the first one is the spark spread option , which is based on fact that some power plants convert gas into electricity .",
    "the underlying instrument is the difference between the gas and electricity prices ( the spark spread ) .",
    "the basic parameter connected with this kind of instrument is the heat rate , the ratio which describes the amount of gas required to generate 1 mwh of electricity .",
    "the definition of such an instrument has a form @xcite : an european spark spread call option written on fuel @xmath0 , at fixed swap ratio @xmath1 , gives its holder the right , but not the obligation to pay k times the unit price of fuel @xmath0 at the options maturity @xmath2 and receive the price of one unit of electricity .",
    "it is easy to imagine such kind of option which better fits the polish electricity market .",
    "we should assume that the underlying instrument is the difference between the carbon and electricity prices .",
    "but in this time there is no possibility of valuation of such an option because we do nt have the representative carbon price .",
    "generally , if we assume that @xmath3 and @xmath4 are respectively future price of 1mwh of electricity and the future price of the unit of fuel and k is the swap ratio than we could describe the payoff of the european electricity - fuel spread call option as @xmath5\\ ] ] and the payoff of the european electricity - fuel spread put option has form @xmath6\\ ] ]    the second derivative is the locational spread option .",
    "it is based on fact that transmission of power from one location to another is very popular transaction .",
    "it is normal , for transmission system , that the power is moved from the place of lower price to the place of higher price and this is why the transaction is profitable .",
    "the whole transaction depends on the difference between the electricity prices and also on delivery costs and for hedging we could use options .",
    "this kind of instrument could be defined in following way @xcite : an european call option on the locational spread between the location one and location two , with maturity @xmath2 , gives its holder the right but not the obligation to pay the price of one unit of electricity at location one at time t and receive the price of @xmath1 units of electricity at location two .",
    "assume that @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the electricity prices at the first location and second location respectively .",
    "the payoff of the european locational spread call option is given by @xmath9\\ ] ] the put option is defined similar and the payoff of the european electricity - fuel spread put option has form @xmath10\\ ] ]",
    "suppose that for describing the commodity we use three qualities @xmath11 : g - the nature of good , t - time when it is available , l - location where it is available . we could define @xcite a real option as technology to physically convert one or more input commodities @xmath11 into an output commodity @xmath12 .",
    "for example most of power plants are real option because they give us the right to convert fuel into electricity .",
    "the transmission line is also real option .",
    "it gives us the right to change the electricity in one location into electricity in second location .",
    "the works of deng , johnson and sogomonian @xcite contain two formulas defining how to valuate generation and transmission assets . if we define that @xmath13 is a one unit of the time - t right to use generation asset we could say that it is the value of just maturing , time - t call option on the spread between electricity and fuel prices @xmath14 and the one unit value of capacity of power plant using some fuel @xmath0 is given by @xmath15 where @xmath2 is the length of power plant life .",
    "similar if we define that @xmath16 is a one unit the time - t right to convert one unit of electricity in location a into one unit of electricity in location b we could say that it is the value of just maturing , time - t call option on the spread between electricity prices in location a and b @xmath17 .",
    "the one unit value of such transmission asset is given by @xmath18 where @xmath2 is the length of transmission network life .",
    "in this section i present the widely known geometric brownian motion model and i valuate the call spread option for the new , interest rate model using martingale methodology .",
    "all calculations are described below .",
    "suppose that the future prices of commodity are described by following stochastic differential equations @xmath19 @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 are i.i.d .",
    "brownian motions .",
    "it is known fact @xcite , that the price of the spread call option with swap ratio @xmath1 and time to maturity @xmath2 , written on futures contract with maturity @xmath24 is given by @xmath25,\\ ] ] where @xmath26 and @xmath27      for domestic currency , for example mwh , we denote two processes : @xmath28 , @xmath29 which are the future prices of one unit of commodity .",
    "the interest rate functions for such processes are respectively @xmath30 and @xmath31 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 are i.i.d . brownian motions .",
    "we assume that there exist the savings security @xmath32 ( for example in usd ) , with constant interest rate @xmath33 , for which @xmath34 is the usd price of future delivery of 1 unit of commodity .",
    "we know @xcite that there exist a martingale measure @xmath35 for which the discounted processes @xmath36 , @xmath37 are martingales .",
    "we have @xmath38 we define the new discounting processes for i=1,2 as @xmath39 where @xmath40 if we change the measure from @xmath35 to @xmath41 @xmath42 we know that processes @xmath43 , @xmath44 are @xmath41-martingales . from interest rate theory",
    "we obtain @xmath45 where @xmath46 if we change the measure again from @xmath41 to @xmath47 @xmath48 we know that @xmath49 and @xmath50 are @xmath47-martingales and similar to the earlier situation , we have @xmath51 where @xmath52 after simple calculations we also have @xmath53 where @xmath54 , and @xmath55",

    ". for discounted processes following equation is true    @xmath59    having the necessary stochastic differential equations we could price the option .",
    "we change the measure from @xmath47 to @xmath60 in following way @xmath61 process @xmath62 is @xmath60-martingale . from ito lemma we know that @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",

    "in this section we describe how to fit our models for real , historical data . at the beginning",
    "we assume that we are given historical prices of future contracts @xmath75 and @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , in discrete time points @xmath79 and @xmath80 , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 .    for geometric brownian motion model",
    "the calibration methodology is not very complicated .",
    "we analyze the returns of future prices of instrument and @xmath83 is its mean , @xmath84 is its variance and correlation parameter is simply the correlation between returns of two instruments .",

    "we see the value of power plant for the heat rate ranging from 5 to 15 for both presented models .",

    "the value of power plant for interest rate model is much more smaller than for gbm model and it tends to zero when the heat rate goes up .",
    "it is a very good feature , because in reality the value of power plant for heat rate greater than @xmath125 should be close to zero . looking at work of deng we could say , that the value of power plant under gbm model is usually too high , so also in this aspect the interest rate model gives better results .",
