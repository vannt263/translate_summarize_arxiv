    "there is still considerable interest in the longitudinal response ( lr ) for quasielastic electron scattering . within the framework of nonrelativistic nuclear models and the impulse approximation ,",
    "it is very difficult to reproduce the observed , quenched lr @xcite . in the mid 80s , several groups calculated the lr function using the classic version of quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd - i ) @xcite .",
    "it was argued that the contribution of the relativistic random phase approximation ( rrpa ) , which includes vacuum polarization , is very important in reducing the lr @xcite .    however , the nucleon has internal structure , and it is nowadays expected that this structure should be modified in a nuclear environment . in qhd -",
    "i @xcite nuclear matter consists of _ point - like _ nucleons interacting through the exchange of scalar ( @xmath0 ) and vector ( @xmath1 ) mesons .",
    "( more recent versions of qhd @xcite are capable of incorporating the effects of hadron internal structure . )",
    "recently , we have developed a relativistic quark model for nuclear matter , namely , the quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) model @xcite , which could be viewed as an extension of qhd - i .",
    "however , in qmc the mesons couple to confined quarks and the nucleon is described by the mit bag model .",
    "using qmc we here report the effect of in - medium changes in the structure of the nucleon on the lr of nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "we first review the calculation of the lr function for quasielastic electron scattering from ( iso - symmetric ) nuclear matter in qhd - i .",
    "the starting point is the lowest order polarization insertion ( pi ) , @xmath2 , for the @xmath1 meson .",
    "this describes the coupling of a virtual vector meson or photon to a particle - hole or nucleon - antinucleon excitation : @xmath3 $ ] , where @xmath4 is the self - consistent nucleon propagator in relativistic hartree approximation ( rha ) @xcite .",
    "we can separate the pi into two pieces : one is the density dependent part , @xmath5 , and the other is the vacuum pi , @xmath6 .",
    "the former is finite , but the latter is divergent and must be renormalized @xcite .    in the hartree approximation , where only the lowest one nucleon ring is considered ,",
    "the lr function , @xmath7 , is simply proportional to @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath9 is the longitudinal ( l ) component of the pi ( we choose the direction of @xmath10 as the @xmath11-axis ) and @xmath12 is the proton electric form factor ( eff ) , which is usually parametrized by a dipole form in free space : @xmath13 with the space - like momentum transfer , @xmath14 , in units of gev@xmath15 .",
    "in rrpa the l component of the pi , @xmath16 , involves the sum of the ring diagrams to all orders .",
    "it involves @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing in the nuclear medium , and is given by @xmath17 / { \\epsilon_l}$ ] , where @xmath18 is the l dielectric function @xcite and @xmath19 is the free @xmath0-meson propagator . here",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 are respectively the scalar and the time component of the mixed pis .",
    "the vacuum component of the scalar pi is again divergent and we need to renormalize it @xcite . for the mixed pi",
    "there is no vacuum polarization and it vanishes at zero density .",
    "to discuss the effect of changes in the internal structure of the nucleon , we consider the following modifications to qhd - i :    1 .",
    "meson - nucleon ( n ) vertex form factor + since both the mesons and nucleons are composite they have finite size . as the simplest example , we take a monopole form factor , @xmath22 , at the vertex with a cut off parameter , @xmath23 gev @xcite .",
    "2 .   modification of the proton electric form factor + we have studied the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon in nuclear medium , using the qmc model @xcite .",
    "the main result of that calculation is that the ratio of the eff of the proton in medium to that in free space decreases essentially linearly as a function of @xmath24 , and that it is accurately parametrized as @xmath25 at @xmath26 ( @xmath27 the normal nuclear matter density ) @xcite .",
    "density dependence of the coupling constants + in qmc the confined quark in the nucleon couples to the @xmath0 field which gives rise to an attractive force . as a result the coupling between the @xmath0 and nucleon",
    "is expected to be reduced at finite density @xcite .",
    "the coupling between the vector meson and nucleon remains constant because it is related to the baryon number .",
    "to study the lr of nuclear matter , we first have to solve the nuclear ground state within rha @xcite . to take into account the modifications 1 and 3",
    ", we replace the @xmath0- and @xmath1-n coupling constants in qhd - i by : @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where the density dependence of @xmath30 is given by solving the nuclear matter problem self - consistently in qmc @xcite . requiring the usual saturation condition for nuclear matter @xcite",
    ", we found the coupling constants : @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( notice that @xmath33 decreased by about 9% at @xmath34 ) . in the calculation we fix the quark mass , @xmath35 , to be 5 or 300 mev , @xmath36 mev and @xmath37 mev , while the bag parameters are chosen so as to reproduce the free nucleon mass with the bag radius @xmath38 fm @xcite .",
    "this yields the effective nucleon mass @xmath39 at @xmath34 and the incompressibility @xmath40 mev .",
    "our result is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : resp ] . in the figure ,",
    "the dotted curve is the result of the hartree approximation , where the proton eff is the same as in free space .",
    "the dashed curve is the result of the full rrpa , without the modifications 1 and 2 .",
    "the dot - dashed curve shows the result of the full rrpa with the meson - n form factor but @xmath41 .",
    "the upper ( lower ) solid curve shows the result of the full rrpa for @xmath42 mev , including all modifications . because of the density dependent coupling , the reduction of the response function from the hartree result , caused by the full rrpa , becomes much smaller than that in qhd - i . on the other hand ,",
    "the modification of the proton eff is very significant , yielding a much bigger reduction in the response .",
    "we can see that the effect of the meson - n form factor is relatively minor .",
    "it is also interesting to see the quark mass dependence of the lr . as an example",
    ", we consider the case of @xmath43 mev . in comparison with the case @xmath35",
    "= 5 mev , it is a little smaller and the peak position is shifted to the higher energy transfer side .",
    "this is related to the smaller effective nucleon mass in the case @xmath35 = 300 mev than when @xmath35 = 5 mev .",
    "the coulomb sum , @xmath44 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : csr ] as a function of three - momentum transfer , @xmath45 . for high @xmath45 ,",
    "the strength is about 20% lower in the full calculation ( the solid and dot - dashed curves are for @xmath35 = 5 and 300 mev , respectively ) than for the hartree response with @xmath41 ( the dotted curve ) . for low @xmath45 ,",
    "the full calculation with the constituent quark mass remains much lower than the hartree result , while in case of the light quark mass it gradually approaches the hartree one .",
    "this difference is caused by that the effective nucleon mass for @xmath35 = 5 mev being larger in matter than that for @xmath35 = 300 mev .",
    "we comment on the transverse response ( tr ) from nuclear matter . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was found that the in - medium modification of the nucleon magnetic form factor within qmc is very small .",
    "therefore , one would expect the total change in the tr caused by rrpa correlations and the effect of the variation of the structure of the nucleon to be much smaller than in the lr .",
    "we have calculated the lr of nuclear matter using the qmc model .",
    "the reduction of the @xmath0-n coupling constant with density decreases the contribution of the rrpa , while the modification of the proton eff in medium reduces the lr considerably .",
    "the lr or the coulomb sum is reduced by about 20% in total , with rrpa correlations and the variation of the in - medium nucleon structure contributing about fifty - fifty .",
    "it will be interesting to extend this work to calculate both the lr and tr functions for finite nuclei , in order to compare directly with the new experimental results which are anticipated soon @xcite .",
