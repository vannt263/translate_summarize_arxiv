    "<S> the evolution of networks of coupled chaotic maps with delayed interactions can be studied in the usual way by analyzing the evolution of the state of elements at each iteration time ( the  simulator \" point of view ) , or it can be analyzed from the point of view of a single element ( the  observer \" perspective ) that is receiving delayed information from the other elements in the system . in the usualsimulator \" timeframe , an absolute time ( i.e. the number of iterations @xmath0 ) is adopted to define the system state at each time @xmath0 . in theobserver \" framework , the state of an element in the system is given by its state at the  simulator \" time @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the information travel time between that element and the observer . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize the convenience of the analysis of the system dynamics in the  observer \" timeframe by showing that the  observer \" dynamics differs substantially from the one in the  simulator \" timeframe , and that the system dynamics in the  observer \" timeframe reflects the proper causality of the interactions among the elements .    # </S>",
    "<S> 1#1    delayed interactions are present in most physical , biological , and social systems </S>",
    "<S> . networks of interacting elements have been extensively used as a first approach to modeling these systems . </S>",
    "<S> most of these models have excluded time delays . since the pioneering studies on coupled map lattices by kaneko and by waller and kapral , </S>",
    "<S> such systems have been investigated for a variety of local dynamics and topologies ( from coupling with nearest neighbors to global coupling @xcite , from random to small - world @xcite to scale - free @xcite connections . </S>",
    "<S> many investigations have been devoted to study the various kind of organized behavior that occurs in a variety of networks of chaotic elements . </S>",
    "<S> synchronization , pattern formation , dynamical clustering , and a zoo of organized spatiotemporal patterns have been observed . </S>",
    "<S> most of these investigations have neglected the delay due to finite transmission and processing speed among the interacting elements . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of time delays in these systems increases their dimensionality and as consequence , a new variety of complex behaviors are accessible . </S>",
    "<S> although , in real systems several kinds of interactions are often acting simultaneously with different propagation and processing velocities , one of them usually dominates . then , in a first approximation , many of these systems can be modeled as a system of elements interacting with a single velocity of transmission . </S>",
    "<S> the topology of the network determines the transmission path distance , and therefore the time delay between elements and the possible attenuation of the signal .    </S>",
    "<S> the use of maps for the local dynamics of the system elements has shown that non - local interactions with time delays can induce a variety of organized behaviors . </S>",
    "<S> however , the organized behavior can be missed or misunderstood if the system is not observed in an adequate way . </S>",
    "<S> for example , if it would be possible to construct a picture of the universe in which each point shows its state at an absolute time measured from the big bang , this picture would look very different than the view of a real observer who is constrained to see the delayed picture ( the  observer \" timeframe ) . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we intend to show through a particular example the convenience of looking at extended dynamical systems with delayed interaction from the  observer \" timeframe .    </S>",
    "<S> another aspect that we intend to demonstrate is the convenience of focusing on the behavior of the coupling field . in an autonomous system </S>",
    "<S> the coupling field on an element is a function of the system history and the topology of the connections among the system elements . </S>",
    "<S> it has been recently shown that there is no difference between the evolution of an element in an autonomous system and the evolution of an isolated element subject to an external forcing that mimics the coupling field . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the dynamics of the coupling field on a given element contains the relevant information about the organization of the system .    </S>",
    "<S> a coupled map network ( cmn ) can be defined as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the local field at time @xmath0 and place @xmath5 that acts as a forcing on element @xmath5 with an efficiency @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the local dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the functional form of @xmath8 depends on the topology and on the properties of the interactions between the elements of the system . </S>",
    "<S> we focus here on @xmath8 functions of the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the set of neighbors of @xmath5 , @xmath11 represents the attenuation or amplification of the signal in its travel from place @xmath12 to place @xmath5 , and @xmath13 is the delay . as an example , here we consider @xmath8 of the form @xmath14 } { 2 \\sum _ { l=1}^{n_v } l^{-\\alpha } }   \\ , , \\label{phi_ret}\\ ] ] where , for a one dimensional array of equally spaced elements , @xmath15 is the number of neighbors at each side of element @xmath5 that are coupled to it , @xmath16 is the distance to @xmath5 , and @xmath17 is the time delay ( i.e. @xmath18 , assumed to be an integer @xmath19 , is the inverse of the signal velocity , or the information time processing per site ) . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath20 is an attenuation parameter ( i.e. @xmath21 represents the flux decrease of a signal in a one , two or three dimensional space ; @xmath20 negative implies amplification ) .    this cmn model , with periodic boundary conditions , </S>",
    "<S> is used in what follows to show the evolution of the system when it is seen from the  simulator \" and from the  observer \" timeframes . </S>",
    "<S> hereafter , by simulator timeframe we mean that an absolute time ( i.e. the number of iterations @xmath0 ) is adopted to define the state of the system . in the observer timeframe , </S>",
    "<S> the state of a given element @xmath12 in the system , from the point of view of the observer at @xmath22 is given by the state of element @xmath12 at  simulator `` time @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the information travel time between that element and the observer . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that an array of elements on a line display a `` chess - board - like '' spatiotemporal pattern in the simulator timeframe . </S>",
    "<S> then , for @xmath18 odd , this system will display in the observer timeframe a `` strips - like '' spatiotemporal pattern . </S>",
    "<S> for the ' ' simulator `` , the mean value @xmath25 and the spatial dispersion @xmath26 ^ 2 $ ] are stationary ( if @xmath27 is even ) . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for the ' ' observer \" , the mean value @xmath28 is periodic and the spatial dispersion @xmath29 ^ 2 $ ] is zero .    </S>",
    "<S> patterns in the evolution of dynamical systems can be detected by direct observation of the system spatiotemporal states , from their power spectra and from quantitative measurements of the mutual correlation among system elements . </S>",
    "<S> these techniques of analysis are obviously consistent among each other but they differ on the their ability to detect and quantify different aspects of the patterns </S>",
    "<S> . however , any of these methods of analysis give in general different results depending on the representation timeframe . </S>",
    "<S> spatiotemporal organized patterns can also manifest in the time dependence of some order parameter such as the mean value , dispersion , number of domains , length of interphase , etc . but again , the evolution of these order parameters depend in general on the used timeframe representation . </S>",
    "<S> it is a direct task to define the observer timeframe if the system dynamics ( i.e. eqs . ( 1 - 3 ) ) is known , but without having some clues on the subjacent dynamics the derivation of the appropriate observer timeframe from the unique analysis of the spatiotemporal pattern in the simulator timeframe is in general complicated if not ambiguous or impossible . </S>",
    "<S> it is out of the scope of this short paper to develop such a method , but as mentioned above , an important clue on the subjacent dynamics can be obtained if the coupling field @xmath4 can be measured . </S>",
    "<S> the main point we want to stress here is that different interpretations of the organized behavior of a system are obtained depending on adopted timeframe , and that the observer timeframe provides the simplest representation to quantify the interaction of a system element with its coupling field . </S>",
    "<S> we show results for a chain of @xmath30 elements with periodic boundary conditions , whose local dynamics is given by the logistic map @xmath31 with @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling is uniform ( i.e. @xmath33 ) , the delay parameter is @xmath34 , the signal intensity decays as @xmath35 ( i.e. @xmath36 ) , and the number of coupled neighbors is @xmath37 .    figures 1(a ) and 1(b ) show , respectively , the dependence of the spatial dispersion with the coupling strength in the simulator and in the observer timeframes , for the same random initial conditions for all @xmath38 . for @xmath39 the spatiotemporal patterns are flat ( constant in space and time ) . for @xmath40 the patters in the simulator timeframe is `` strips - like '' and in the observer timeframe is `` chess - board - like '' ; note that the `` strips - like '' pattern in the simulator timeframe is interpreted as syncronization . between @xmath41 and @xmath42 the reverse occurs : the pattern are quasi `` strips - like '' in the observer timeframe and quasi `` chess - board - like '' in the simulator timeframe . below @xmath43 </S>",
    "<S> the patters are turbulent in both timeframes </S>",
    "<S> .        figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) show , respectively , the spatiotemporal pattern in the simulator and in the observer timeframes for @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial patterns has been displayed each 120 iterations in order to show the long term structure . </S>",
    "<S> note that the spatiotemporal pattern in the simulator timeframe looks very irregular , in the sense that nearest neighbors tend to have dissimilar states . </S>",
    "<S> however , some structures can be observed .            on the other hand , the spatiotemporal pattern in the observer timeframe ( i.e. the system as seen by the central element @xmath44 ) looks smooth and much more organized . </S>",
    "<S> figure 2(c ) shows the spatiotemporal pattern of the forcing field @xmath45 in the observer timeframe . </S>",
    "<S> note that the pattern in figure 2(c ) is even smoother that the pattern in figure 2(b ) . to ilustrate the drastic effect that might have the ratio @xmath46 figures 3(a - c ) </S>",
    "<S> show the patterns in figures 2(a - c ) but for the case with @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> figures 4(a ) and 4(b ) show the return map of the spatial mean value @xmath48 in the simulator and observer timeframes , respectively . due to the spatial irregularity in the simulator timeframe , </S>",
    "<S> the mean @xmath49 remains about constant and occupies a small area in the return plane . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the observer timeframe the mean @xmath50 displays almost a period 2 . </S>",
    "<S> a similar contrast is observed in the return map of the spatial dispersion @xmath51 .        note that in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) the delay is included in the forcing field @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> if the value of @xmath52 is systematically correlated with the value of @xmath4 , then we expect to have a smooth spatiotemporal pattern in the observer timeframe . </S>",
    "<S> figures 5(a ) and 5(b ) show , respectively , the return map of the forcing @xmath53 of the first element and the forcing @xmath53 vs the state of the first element . note that in figure 5(b ) the points remain close to the diagonal . for cases where the spatiotemporal pattern in the observer timeframe looks irregular </S>",
    "<S> , the corresponding figure 5(b ) would show an anticorrelation or a poor correlation between @xmath52 and @xmath4 .    . </S>",
    "<S> b ) forcing versus state on the first element . </S>",
    "<S> , width=302 ]    for the same parameter values in the above example , figures 6(a - d ) show the return map of the spatial mean value @xmath54 in the simulator timeframe for various time delays : a ) @xmath55 , b ) @xmath56 , c ) @xmath57 , and d ) @xmath58 . for odd values of @xmath18 , </S>",
    "<S> the return map of the spatial mean value @xmath59 in the observer timeframe looks almost the same as the one in figure 4(b ) , which correspond to @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the shape of the returns in the simulator timeframe show a clear dependence on the time delay @xmath18 , demonstrating the convenience of analyzing the collective behavior of the system in the observer timeframe .    , b ) @xmath56 , c ) @xmath57 , and d ) @xmath58 . , </S>",
    "<S> width=302 ]    the system seen in the observer timeframe does not necessarily show more coherence than in the simulator one . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the coherence observed in the simulator timeframe is in all cases the result of the subjacent causality in the spatiotemporal pattern in the observer timeframe .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> the presence of delayed interactions in the cmn defined by eqs . ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) induces a variety of organized behavior . </S>",
    "<S> it is out of the scope of this short paper to explore and characterize the model outputs in the parameter space of the system . </S>",
    "<S> here , we just mention that smooth spatiotemporal patterns in the observer timeframe are generally associated with small values of the spatial dispersion and the difference @xmath60 . in any case </S>",
    "<S> , we emphasize the convenience of looking at the evolution of networks with delayed interactions in the observer timeframe since this is a causal timeframe . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we have shown that relevant information can be obtained by analyzing the dynamics of the local coupling field @xmath8 since it contains the sum of all the delayed interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the use of the observer timeframe can also be relevant for the analysis of experimental data and of models of continuous spatiotemporal systems . </S>"
