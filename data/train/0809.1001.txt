    "experimental data on transverse - mass spectra of kaons produced in central au+au @xcite and pb+pb @xcite collisions reveal peculiar dependence on the incident energy .",
    "the inverse - slope parameter ( so called effective temperature @xmath2 ) of these spectra at midrapidity increases with incident energy in the energy domain of bnl alternating gradient synchrotron ( ags ) and then saturates at energies of cern super proton synchrotron ( sps ) . in refs .",
    "@xcite it was assumed that this saturation is associated with the deconfinement phase transition .",
    "this assumption was indirectly confirmed by the fact that microscopic transport models , based on hadronic degrees of freedom , failed to reproduce the observed behavior of the kaon inverse slope @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations of ref .",
    "@xcite succeeded to describe this behavior .",
    "however , in order to reproduce it these hydrodynamic simulations required incident - energy dependence of the freeze - out temperature which almost repeated the shape of the corresponding kaon effective temperature .",
    "this happened even in spite of using an equation of state ( eos ) involving a phase transition into the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "this way , the puzzle of kaon effective temperatures was just translated into a puzzle of freeze - out temperatures .",
    "moreover , results of ref .",

    "@xcite it was shown that dynamical description of freeze - out @xcite , accepted in the model of 3-fluid dynamics ( 3fd ) @xcite , naturally explains the incident energy behavior of inverse - slope parameters of transverse - mass spectra observed in experiment .",
    "this freeze - out dynamics , effectively resulting in a pattern similar to that of the dynamic liquid  gas transition , differs from conventionally used freeze - out schemes . in the brief letter @xcite only midrapidity inverse - slope parameters in central collisions",
    "were presented . in the present paper",
    "we would like to extend analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite by presenting transverse - mass spectra themselves at various impact parameters and rapidities and compare them with available experimental data in the range from ags to sps incident energies .",
    "these spectra are computed with the same set of model parameters as that summarized in ref .",
    "in particular , the hadronic eos @xcite with incompressibility @xmath3 mev is used .",
    "the 3fd model is designed for simulating heavy - ion collisions in the range from ags to sps energies . unlike the conventional hydrodynamics , where local instantaneous stopping of projectile and target matter is assumed ,",
    "a specific feature of the dynamic 3-fluid description is a finite stopping power resulting in a counter - streaming regime of leading baryon - rich matter .",
    "this counter - streaming is described in terms of two interacting baryon - rich fluids , initially associated with constituent nucleons of the projectile ( p ) and target ( t ) nuclei . in addition , newly produced particles , populating the midrapidity region , are associated with a baryon - free `` fireball '' ( f ) fluid .",
    "we have started our simulations @xcite with a simple hadronic eos @xcite .",
    "the 3fd model turned out to be able to reasonably reproduce a large body of experimental data @xcite in a wide energy range from ags to sps .",
    "this was done with a unique set of model parameters summarized in ref .",
    "problems were met in description of the transverse flow @xcite .",
    "the directed flow required a softer eos at top ags and sps energies ( in particular , this desired softening may signal occurrence of the phase transition into the qgp ) .",
    "the transverse - mass spectra are most sensitive to the freeze - out parameters of the model . in the 3fd model the same freeze - out procedure",
    "is applied to both the thermal and chemical processes .",
    "normalization of the meson spectra is directly related to the freeze - out temperature .",
    "inverse slopes of the transverse - mass spectra represent a combined effect of the temperature and collective transverse flow of the hydrodynamical expansion .",
    "had it been only the effect of thermal excitation , inverse slopes for different hadronic species would approximately equal .",
    "the collective transverse flow makes them different .",
    "these two effects partially compensate each other : the later freeze - out occurs , the lower temperature and the stronger collective flow are .",
    "nevertheless , inverse slopes turn out to be sensitive to the instant of the freeze - out .",
    "below we demonstrate that not only slopes but also normalizations of the pion transverse - mass spectra are well described by this unified chemical - thermal freeze - out .",
    "situation with kaons is more delicate , since we have to take into account the associative production of strangeness giving rise to a strangeness suppression factor .",
    "freeze - out procedure adopted in the 3fd model was analyzed in detail in ref .",
    "this method of freeze - out can be called dynamical , since the freeze - out process here is integrated into fluid dynamics through hydrodynamic equations .",
    "the freeze - out front is not defined just `` geometrically '' on the condition of the freeze - out criterion met . ] but rather is a subject the fluid evolution .",
    "it competes with the fluid flow and not always reaches the place where the freeze - out criterion is met .",
    "this kind of freeze - out is similar to the model of `` continuous emission '' proposed in ref .",

    "the reason for this is as follows .",
    "whereas the statistical model assumes a single uniform fireball , in the 3fd simulations at the late stage of the evolution the system effectively consists of several `` fireballs '' : two overlapping fireballs ( one baryon - rich and one baryon - free ) at lower sps energies and three fireballs ( two baryon - rich and one baryon - free ) at top sps energies @xcite . at the top sps energies these three fireballs turn out to be even spatially separated",
    "therefore , whereas high multiplicities of mesons and antibaryons are achieved by means of high temperatures in the statistical model , the 3fd model explains them by an additional contribution of the baryon - free fireball at a lower temperature . the freeze - out baryon density @xmath22 exhibits a maximum at incident energies of @xmath23 10@xmath030@xmath0 gev which are well within range of the planned fair in gsi .",

    "these observables distinguish between the hadronic and quark ",
    "gluon phases .",
    "however , available experimental data on fluctuations : on @xmath51 fluctuations @xcite and positive - to - negative charge - ratio fluctuations @xcite , at sps energies well agree with the hadronic predictions . only the @xmath50 fluctuations",
    "@xcite reveal a nontrivial behaviour with the incident energy .",
    "the fact that the freeze - out takes place at rather low values of energy density and temperature ( see figs .",
    "[ fig1.1 ] and [ fig1.2 ] ) explains why we observe only hadronic fluctuations at the freeze - out , even if the compressed matter was in the quark ",
    "gluon phase .",
    "all the quark ",
    "gluon fluctuations get dissolved during the long path of the system from hadronization to freeze - out .",
    "fluctuations of the @xmath50 ratio can be an exception from this rule , since this signal is the most robust .",
    "a @xmath46 meson can disappear only if it meets a particle of the opposite strangeness ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 or @xmath47 ) .",
    "if the strange system is relatively dilute at the hadronic stage of the expansion , as it is the case at lower sps energies , the probability to meet a particle of the opposite strangeness is relatively low .",
    "therefore , the signal from the quark  gluon phase partially survives . at higher energies ( top sps energies )",
    "the strange system becomes already dense enough to destroy this signal .",
    "this mechanism can explain a nontrivial energy dependence of the @xmath50 fluctuations , observed by the na49 collaboration @xcite .",
    "it implies violation of the chemical equilibrium for strange particles at the late stage of the expansion .",
    "therefore , it is beyond the frame of the present version of the 3fd model , where @xmath46 meson abundance immediately follow changes of densities of the matter .",
    "if this explanation is true , fluctuations of the ratio @xmath54 should reveal even stronger energy dependence than those of the ratio @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the observed yield of @xmath57-particles .",
    "the same mechanism can be behind the horn effect in the excitation function of the @xmath58 ratio @xcite .",
