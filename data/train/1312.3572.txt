    "of particular interest is the scenario in which the produced nuclear matter managed to thermalize in this anisotropic volume , causing its initial anisotropy from the coordinate space to be transfered via mutual interactions into the resulting and observable anisotropy in momentum space .",
    "we refer to this phenomenon in this work as _ collective anisotropic flow _ , or just simply as _",
    "flow_. clearly , collective anisotropic flow is a direct probe of the degree of thermalization of the produced matter , and correspondingly an indirect probe of its transport properties ( e.g. viscosity ) .",

    "we now attempt to attach a more rigorous treatment to the concept of  collectivity \" by discussing which tools and observables we can utilize experimentally in order to disentangle it from processes which generally involve only a small subset of the produced particles , generally termed  nonflow \" .    in order to make a statement on whether the harmonics @xmath5 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fourier ] ) are dominated by contributions from collective anisotropic flow or by some other processes which are non - collective in nature , we can use correlation techniques involving two or more particles . in this paper",
    "our main focus will be on the latter , to which we refer to as _ multi - particle correlation techniques_. when only collective anisotropic flow is present , all produced particles are independently emitted , and are correlated only to some common reference planes .",
    "this physical observation translates into the following mathematical statement : @xmath8 the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : factorization ] ) is a joint multi - variate probability density function ( p.d.f . ) of @xmath9 observables @xmath10 .",
    "the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : factorization ] ) is the product of the normalized marginalized p.d.f , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , which are the same  @xcite and are given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : fourier ] ) . therefore ,",
    "when all particles are emitted independently , as is the case for collective anisotropic flow , the joint p.d.f . for _ any _ number of particles will factorize as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : factorization ] ) . based on this reasoning",
    ", one can build up , in principle , infinitely many independent azimuthal observables sensitive to various combinations of flow harmonic moments and corresponding symmetry planes by adding more and more particles to the observables .",
    "when flow harmonics fluctuate event - by - event , different underlying p.d.f.s of flow fluctuations will result in different values of flow harmonic moments and corresponding symmetry planes .",
    "this illustrates our main point : in order to determine the underlying p.d.f . of flow fluctuations , one",
    "is necessarily led towards multi - particle correlation techniques .",
    "we will elaborate on this point in detail and generalize it further in the main part of the paper . for completeness",
    ", we now present the historical overview of the utilization of multi - particle correlation techniques in anisotropic flow analyses , together with all of the technical limitations and issues inherit to them , which this paper overcomes .",
    "multi - particle correlation techniques in anisotropic flow analyses have been used for more than three decades . in the theoretical studies of global event",
    "shapes  @xcite and in the subsequent study presented in  @xcite , the joint multi - variate p.d.f . of @xmath13 particles for an event with multiplicity @xmath13 was utilized in flow analyses for the first time . on the other hand , the very first experimental attempt to go beyond two - particle azimuthal correlations  @xcite date back to bevalac work published in  @xcite . in that paper , a quantitative description of collectivity",
    "was attempted by generalizing the observable for two - particle correlations , namely the smaller angle between the transverse momenta of two produced particles , into the geometric mean of @xmath14 azimuthal separations within the @xmath9-particle multiplet .",
    "however , it was realized immediately that the net contribution of low - order few - particle correlations is cumulative if one increases the number of particles in such multiplets , which triggered the demand for more sophisticated techniques that would instead suppress systematically such contributions for increasingly large multiplets  @xcite .",
    "this was pursued further in a series of papers on multi - particle correlations and cumulants by borghini _",
    "et al _ ( for a summary of the mathematical and statistical properties of cumulants we refer the reader to  @xcite ) . in the first paper of the series  @xcite , borghini _ et",
    "al _ defined cumulants in the context of flow analyses in terms of the moments of the distribution of the @xmath15-vector amplitude  @xcite . as a landmark of their approach ,",
    "the authors have introduced a formalism of generating functions accompanied with interpolation methods in the complex plane as the simplest and fastest way to calculate cumulants from experimental data .",
    "the formalism of generating functions is particularly robust against biases stemming from non - uniform detector acceptance , which is frequently the dominant systematic bias in anisotropic flow analyses .",
    "however , there were some serious drawbacks , which were recognized and discussed already by the authors in the original paper .",
    "most notably , both two- and multi - particle cumulants were plagued by trivial and non - negligible contributions from autocorrelations , which caused an interference between the various harmonics .",
    "this led the authors to propose an improved version of the generating function in  @xcite , which by design generated cumulants free from autocorrelations .",
    "in essence , the way cumulants were defined conceptually has changed between the two papers : in  @xcite cumulants were defined directly in terms of multi - particle azimuthal correlations , which are free from autocorrelations by definition , while in  @xcite cumulants were defined in terms of the moments of the distribution of the @xmath15-vector amplitude , which by definition have contributions from autocorrelations . both methods to calculate cumulants",
    "were capable of estimating reference and differential flow .",
    "further improvement , still relying on the formalism of generating functions , came with the lee - yang zero ( lyz ) method  @xcite , which isolates the genuine multi - particle estimate for flow harmonics , corresponding to the asymptotic behavior of the cumulant series .",
    "the formalism of generating functions , however , has its own built - in systematic biases .",
    "most importantly , the proposed interpolating methods in the complex plane to calculate cumulants are not numerically stable for all values of flow harmonics and multiplicity (  parameter @xmath16 has to be tuned \" ) ; in addition , one never exactly recovers the cumulants as they are defined (  the series expansion of the generating functions has to be terminated manually at a certain order , in order to close the coupled system of equations for the cumulants \" ) ; finally , the formalism as presented in these papers is limited to the cases where all harmonics in multi - particle correlators coincide .",
    "a notable alternative cumulant approach in terms of implementation was used in  @xcite , which , at the expense of reducing statistics , removed autocorrelations by explicitly constructing multiple subevents from the original event .",
    "these limitations were removed partially with @xmath15-cumulants ( qc ) published recently in  @xcite , which do not rely on the formalism of generating functions , but instead utilize voloshin s original idea of expressing multi - particle azimuthal correlations analytically in terms of @xmath15-vectors evaluated ( in general ) in different harmonics .",
    "@xmath15-cumulants , however , are very tedious to calculate analytically , and such calculations were accomplished only for a rather limited subset of multi - particle azimuthal correlations which have been most frequently used in anisotropic flow analyses to date .",
    "the present paper surpasses completely all technical limitations of these previous publications and provides a _ generic framework _ allowing _ all _ multi - particle azimuthal correlations to be evaluated analytically , with a fast single pass over the data , free from autocorrelations by definition , and corrected for systematic biases due to various detector inefficiencies ( e.g. non - uniform azimuthal acceptance , @xmath17-dependent reconstruction efficiency , finite detector granularity , etc . ) . with this framework ,",
    "a plethora of new multi - particle azimuthal observables are now accessible experimentally . in this paper",
    "we propose and discuss some new concrete examples ( so - called _ standard candles _ ) .",
    "we have paid special attention to the development of algorithms , which can be used to calculate recursively higher - order multi - particle azimuthal correlators in terms of lower - order ones , for the cases when their standalone generic formulae are too long and impractical for direct use and implementation .",
    "finally , we point out the existence of a peculiar systematic bias in traditional differential flow analyses , when all particles are divided into the two groups of reference particles ( rp ) and particles of interest ( poi ) .",
    "this systematic bias stems solely from the selection criteria for rps and pois , and is present also in the ideal case when all nonflow correlations are absent .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "s : two- and multi - particle azimuthal correlations ] , we introduce two- and multi - particle azimuthal correlations , motivate and discuss their usage in anisotropic flow analyses , and point out the technical issues which plagued their evaluation in the past . in section  [ s : generic equations ]",
    ", we outline our new generic framework which enables exact and fast evaluation of all multi - particle azimuthal correlations , and can also be used to correct for systematic biases due to various detector inefficiencies . in section  [ s : monte carlo studies ]",
    "we use two toy monte carlo studies to demonstrate the framework s ability to correct for biases due to non - uniform azimuthal acceptance and non - uniform reconstruction efficiency .",
    "we then use a realistic monte carlo to demonstrate its usage in the measurement of some new flow observables that we propose and discuss in detail . in section  [",
    "s : detectors with finite granularity ] , we point out how biases due to finite granularity of the detector must be considered and corrected for in the measurement of multi - particle azimuthal correlations .",
    "finally , in section  [ s : systematic bias due to particle selection criteria ] , we discuss the systematic bias which is present in traditional differential flow analyses even when all nonflow correlations are absent , but arise from the selection criteria of particles used for the differential flow analysis . in the appendices we present all technical steps in detail .",
    "we consider two- and multi - particle azimuthal correlations measured event - by - event as our basic observables whose moments can be related to moments of the flow harmonics and the corresponding symmetry planes .",
    "this relation can be illustrated with the simple example of the two - particle azimuthal correlation of harmonics @xmath9 and @xmath18 .",
    "for the dataset consisting of @xmath13 azimuthal angles @xmath19 we have : @xmath20 the constraint @xmath21 removes contributions from autocorrelations in each sum by definition . using the factorization property in eq .",
    "( [ eq : factorization ] ) for the case of joint two - particle p.d.f . and using the orthogonality properties of trigonometric functions , one can show that the first and second moment of @xmath22 are given as : @xmath23 these are the analytic expressions for the mean and variance of the two - particle azimuthal correlations , which are valid for the general case when the fourier - like p.d.f .",
    "( [ eq : fourier ] ) is parametrized with all harmonics @xmath5 .    motivated with the previous simple example , we now introduce our main observables , namely multi - particle azimuthal correlations , in a generic way .",
    "the average @xmath24-particle correlation in harmonics @xmath25 is given by the following generic definition : @xmath26 in the above definition , @xmath13 is the multiplicity of an event , @xmath6 labels the azimuthal angles of the produced particles , while @xmath27 labels particle weights whose physical meaning and use cases will be elaborated on .",
    "we have in summation enforced the condition @xmath28 in order to remove the trivial and non - negligible contributions from all possible autocorrelations ( self - correlations ) by definition in all summands .",
    "we stress that we consider any correlation technique utilized in anisotropic flow analyses to be unsound and unusable if it has any kind of contribution stemming from autocorrelations .",
    "particle weights appearing in definition ( [ eq : mpcorrelation ] ) can be used to remove systematic biases originating from detector inefficiencies of various types .",
    "well known examples of particle weights are so - called @xmath6-weights , @xmath29 , which deal with the systematic bias due to non - uniform acceptance in azimuth , and @xmath17-weights , @xmath30 , which deal with the non - uniform transverse momentum reconstruction efficiency of produced particles . in general , we allow the particle weight @xmath27 to be the most general function of the azimuthal angle , transverse momentum , pseudorapidity , particle type , etc . :",
    "@xmath31 the new generic framework presented in this paper allows one to use the above general particle weights for any multi - particle azimuthal correlation . in subsequent sections in toy monte carlo studies we provide two concrete examples .",
    "we can straightforwardly relate various moments of the observables defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mpcorrelation ] ) to various moments of the harmonics @xmath5 and the symmetry planes @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , relying solely on factorization as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : factorization ] ) and orthogonality properties of trigonometric functions , the following analytic expression follows for the first moment : @xmath32 this result was first presented in  @xcite . when the averaging is extended to all events , only the isotropic correlators , i.e. the ones for which @xmath33 , will have non - zero values  @xcite .",
    "it is obvious from the expression  ( [ eq : mixedharmonicsexpversion ] ) that the trivial periodicity of each symmetry plane is automatically accounted for .",
    "as already remarked in the introduction , for the case of an idealized initial geometry all symmetry planes @xmath4 coincide and the imaginary part of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mixedharmonicsexpversion ] ) is identically zero for isotropic correlators .",
    "however , we point out that , in the more realistic case , the effects of flow fluctuations can be independently quantified by measuring the imaginary parts of isotropic correlators in mixed harmonics as well , which a priori are non - vanishing .",
    "the importance of our new generic framework is that it makes it possible for the first time to measure the above observables  ( [ eq : mixedharmonicsexpversion ] ) for any number of particles @xmath24 in the correlators , for any values of the harmonics @xmath34 , and for both the real and imaginary parts .",
    "one of the consequences of event - by - event flow fluctuations is the fact that @xmath35 , where flow moments @xmath36 are defined as @xmath37 different underlying p.d.f.s , @xmath38 , of event - by - event flow fluctuations will yield different values for the moments @xmath36 .",
    "looking at this statement from a different angle , we can also conclude that two completely different p.d.f.s , reflecting completely different physical mechanisms that drive flow fluctuations , can have , accidentally , the very same first moment @xmath39 .",
    "thus , the traditional way of reporting results of anisotropic flow analyses by estimating only the first moment of the underlying p.d.f , namely @xmath39 , is , from our point of view , rather incomplete . instead , one should measure as many moments @xmath36 as possible of the underlying p.d.f , @xmath38 , because each moment by construction carries independent information . to finalize this discussion",
    ", we stress that a priori it is not guaranteed that a p.d.f .",
    "is uniquely determined by its moments .",
    "necessary and sufficient conditions for the p.d.f . to be uniquely determined in terms of its moments have been worked out only recently and are known as the krein - lin conditions  @xcite : @xmath40\\equiv\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{-\\ln f(x^2)}{1+x^2}\\ , dx\\quad\\rightarrow\\quad k[f]=\\infty\\ , , \\label{eq : krein}\\ ] ] @xmath41 the generic framework presented in this paper enables one to measure the flow moments @xmath36 for any @xmath42 .",
    "such results , in combination with the krein - lin conditions outlined above , can be used to experimentally constrain the nature of the p.d.f . for flow fluctuations .",
    "in this section , we present and discuss our main results . for an event with multiplicity",
    "@xmath13 we construct the following two sets : @xmath43 where @xmath6 labels the azimuthal angles of particles , while @xmath27 labels particle weights introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq : generalparticleweights ] ) . given these two sets , we calculate in each event",
    "weighted @xmath15-vectors  @xcite as complex numbers defined by @xmath44 from the above definition , it immediately follows that : @xmath45 which shall be used in the implementation of our final results in order to reduce the amount of needed computations .",
    "we remark that we need a single pass over the particles to calculate the @xmath15-vectors for multiple values of indices @xmath9 and @xmath46 .",
    "we first observe that the expressions in the numerator and the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mpcorrelation ] ) are trivially related .",
    "namely , given the result for the numerator which depends on harmonics @xmath25 , the result for the denominator can be obtained by using the result for numerator and setting all harmonics @xmath25 to 0 .",
    "therefore in what follows we focus mostly on the results for the numerator , and introduce the following shortcuts : @xmath47 the key experimental question in anisotropic flow analyses relying on correlation techniques was how to enforce the condition @xmath28 in the summations ( [ eq : num ] ) and ( [ eq : den ] ) without using the brute force approach of @xmath24 nested loops .",
    "such an approach is not feasible even for four - particle correlators and events with a multiplicity of the order of 100 particles .",
    "it is therefore unusable for events with multiplicities of the order of 1000 particles , characteristic of present day relativistic heavy - ion collisions . how this problem was resolved approximately and for",
    "some specific correlators has been summarized in section  [ s : introduction ] . here",
    "we provide an exact and general answer .",
    "we outline explicitly the results for the case of 2- , 3- , and 4-p correlators expressed analytically in terms of @xmath15-vectors defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qvector ] ) . for 2-p correlators",
    "it follows : @xmath48 additionally , for 3-p correlators it follows : @xmath49 finally , for 4-p correlators we have obtained : @xmath50 the analogous results for higher order correlators can be spelled out in a similar manner , but they are too long to fit in this paper . instead , we provide them calculated and implemented ( in .cpp and .nb file formats ) up to and including 8-particle correlators at the following link  @xcite . as an alternative",
    ", we have developed recursive algorithms which , at the expense of runtime performance , calculate analytically higher order correlators in terms of lower order ones .",
    "the recursive algorithms will be presented in detail in section  [ ss : algorithm ] .    as the number of particles in correlators increases , the above analytical standalone expressions for multi - particle correlators quickly become impractical for direct use and implementation .",
    "for instance , the analogous analytic result for the 8-p correlator contains 4140 distinct terms , each of which is a product of up to eight distinct complex @xmath15-vectors",
    ". a closer look at the structure of these analytic solutions revealed that the number of distinct terms per correlator form a well known bell sequence : @xmath51 which gives the number of different ways to partition a set with @xmath24 elements . in our context , @xmath24 is the number of particles in the correlator , and  different way to partition \" corresponds to different possible contributions from autocorrelations .",
    "the above results can be straightforwardly extended to the case of differential multi - particle correlators , for which one particle in the multiplet is restricted to belong only to the narrow differential bin of interest ; the self - contained treatment of differential multi - particle correlators is presented in appendix  [ s : appendix to differential multi - particle correlators ] .",
    "as already remarked , direct evaluation of expression   for higher order correlators quickly becomes impractical due to the number of terms .",
    "for that reason , we have developed algorithms which recursively express all higher order correlators in terms of the lower order ones . observing that @xmath52",
    "it is clear that the @xmath53 is determined through ordered partitions of the numbers @xmath54 .",
