    "the notion of information theoretic secrecy in communication systems was first introduced by shannon in @xcite .",
    "the information theoretic secrecy requires that the received signal of the eavesdropper does not provide any information about the transmitted messages .",
    "shannon considered a pessimistic situation where both the intended receiver and the eavesdropper have direct access to the transmitted signal ( which is called ciphertext ) . under these circumstances",
    ", he proved a negative result showing that perfect secrecy can be achieved only when the entropy of the secret key is greater than , or equal to , the entropy of the message . in modern cryptography ,",
    "all practical cryptosystems are based on shannnon s pessimistic assumption .",
    "due to practical constraints , secret keys are much shorter than messages ; therefore , these practical cryptosystems are theoretically susceptible to breaking by attackers .",
    "the goal of designing such practical ciphers , however , is to guarantee that no efficient algorithm exists for breaking them .",
    "wyner in @xcite showed that the above negative result is a consequence of shannon s restrictive assumption that the adversary has access to precisely the same information as the legitimate receiver .",
    "wyner considered a scenario in which a wire - tapper receives the transmitted signal over a degraded channel with respect to the legitimate receiver s channel .",
    "he further assumed that the wire - tapper has no computational limitations and knows the codebook used by the transmitter .",
    "he measured the level of ignorance at the eavesdropper by its equivocation and characterized the capacity - equivocation region .",
    "interestingly , a non - negative perfect secrecy capacity is always achievable for this scenario .",
    "the secrecy capacity for the gaussian wire - tap channel is characterized by leung - yan - cheong in @xcite .",
    "wyner s work is then extended to the general ( non - degraded ) broadcast channel with confidential messages by csiszar and korner @xcite .",
    "they considered transmitting confidential information to the legitimate receiver while transmitting common information to both the legitimate receiver and the wire - tapper .",
    "they established a capacity - equivocation region for this channel .",
    "the bcc has recently been further studied in @xcite , where the source node transmits a common message to both receivers , along with two additional confidential messages , each aimed at one of the two receivers . here",
    ", the confidentiality of each message is measured with respect to the other user , and there is no external eavesdropper",
    ".    the fading wire - tap channel is investigated in @xcite where the source - to destination channel and the source - to - eavesdropper channel are corrupted by multiplicative fading gain coefficients , in addition to additive white gaussian noise . in this work",
    ", channels are fast fading and the channel state information ( csi ) of the legitimate receiver is available at the transmitter . the perfect secrecy capacity is derived for two different scenarios regarding the availability of the eavesdropper s csi .",
    "moreover , the optimal power control policy is obtained for the different scenarios .",
    "the effect of the slowly fading channel on the secrecy capacity of a conventional wire - tap channel is studied in @xcite . in these works",
    ", it is assumed that the fading is quasi - static and the transmitter does not know the fading gains . the outage probability , which is the probability that the main channel is stronger than the eavesdropper s channel , is defined in these works . in an outage strategy , the transmission rate is fixed and the information is detected when the instantaneous main channel is stronger than the instantaneous eavesdropper s channel ; otherwise , either nothing is decoded at the legitimate receiver , or the information is leaked to the eavesdropper .",
    "the term outage capacity refers to the maximum achievable average rate . in @xcite , a broadcast strategy for the slowly fading gaussian point to point channel",
    "is introduced . in this strategy ,",
    "the transmitter uses a layered coding scheme and the receiver is viewed as a continuum of ordered users .    in @xcite ,",
    "the wire - tap channel is extended to the parallel broadcast channels and also to the fading channels with multiple receivers . in @xcite ,",
    "the secrecy constraint is a perfect equivocation for each of the messages , even if all the other messages are revealed to the eavesdropper .",
    "the secrecy sum capacity for a reverse broadcast channel is derived subject to this restrictive assumption . the notion of the wire - tap channel",
    "is also extended to multiple access channels @xcite , relay channels @xcite , parallel channels @xcite and multiple - input multiple - output channels @xcite .",
    "some other related works on the communication of confidential messages can be found in @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we consider a scenario where a source node wishes to broadcast two confidential messages to two receivers , while a wire - tapper also receives the transmitted signal .",
    "this model is motivated by wireless communications , where individual secure messages are broadcast over shared media and can be received by any illegitimate receiver .",
    "in fact , we simplify the restrictive constraint imposed in @xcite and assume that the eavesdropper does not have access to the other messages .",
    "we first study the general broadcast channel with an eavesdropper .",
    "we present an achievable rate region for this channel .",
    "our achievable coding scheme is based on a combination of random binning and the gelfand - pinsker binning @xcite .",
    "this scheme matches the marton s inner bound @xcite on the broadcast channel without confidentiality constraint .",
    "we further study the situation where the channels are physically degraded and characterize the corresponding secrecy capacity region .",
    "our achievable coding scheme is based on cover s superposition coding @xcite and random binning .",
    "we refer to this scheme as the secret superposition coding .",
    "this capacity region matches the capacity region of the degraded broadcast channel without any security constraint .",
    "it also matches the secrecy capacity of the wire - tap channel .",
    "we also characterize the secrecy capacity region when the channels are additive white gaussian noise .",
    "we show that the secret superposition of gaussian codebooks is the optimal choice . based on the rate characterization of the secure broadcast channel",
    ", we then use broadcast strategy for the slow fading wire - tap channel when only the eavesdropper s channel is fixed and known at the transmitter . in broadcast strategy , a source node sends secure layers of coding and the receiver is viewed as a continuum of ordered users .",
    "we derive optimum power allocation for the layers which maximizes the total average rate .    in @xcite",
    ", we published a conference version of this work where the achievable rate region of the general broadcast channel with an eavesdropper and the secrecy capacity region of the degraded one were addressed .",
    "however , we later became aware that reference @xcite had considered a similar model as used in this paper and had independently characterized the secrecy capacity region of the broadcast channel ( when the channels are degraded ) .",
    "they also generalized their results to the parallel degraded broadcast channel with an eavesdropper . independently and",
    "parallel to our work , reference @xcite considered the gaussian broadcast channel with an eavesdropper and characterized its capacity region .",
    "authors of @xcite provided two methods for their converse proof .",
    "the first one uses the alternative representation of the mutual information as an integration of the minimum - mean - square - error ( mmse ) , as well as the properties of the mmse .",
    "the second one uses the relationship between the differential entropy and the fisher information via the de bruin identity , along with the properties of the fisher information . in this work , however , we use costa s entropy power inequality to provide the converse proof .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we introduce the system model . in section iii",
