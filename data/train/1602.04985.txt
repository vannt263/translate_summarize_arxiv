    "in a maker - breaker positional game , a finite set @xmath4 and a family @xmath5 of subsets of @xmath4 are given , and two players , maker and breaker , alternate in claiming unclaimed elements of @xmath4 until all the elements are claimed , with breaker going first . maker wins if he claims all elements of a set from @xmath5 , and breaker wins otherwise .",
    "the set @xmath4 is referred to as the _ board _ , and the elements of @xmath5 as the _ winning sets_. as maker - breaker positional games are finite games of perfect information and no chance moves , we know that in every game one of the players has a winning strategy .",
    "more on various aspects of positional game theory can be found in the monograph of beck  @xcite and in the recent monograph  @xcite .",
    "we are interested in positional games on graphs , where the board @xmath4 is the edge set of a graph , and we will mostly deal with games played on the edge set of the complete graph @xmath6 .",
    "three standard positional games that we will look at here are _ connectivity _",
    "game , where maker wants to claim a spanning tree , _ perfect matching _",
    "game , where the winning sets are all perfect matchings of the base graph , and _ hamilton cycle _ game , where maker s goal is to claim a hamilton cycle .",
    "once the order @xmath1 of the base graph gets large , it turns out that maker can win in each of the three mentioned games in a straightforward fashion .",
    "but our curiosity does not end there , as there are several standard approaches to make the setting more interesting to study .",
    "one of them is the so - called _ biased games _ , where breaker is given more power by being allowed to claim more than one edge per move .",
    "the other approach we focus on is the _ fast win _ of maker , where the question we want to answer is not just if maker can win , but also how fast can he win .",
    "given a positive integer @xmath3 , in the @xmath0 biased game breaker claims @xmath3 edges in each move , while maker claims a single edge .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 is called the bias . due to the  bias monotonicity \" of maker - breaker games , it is straightforward to conclude that for any positional game there is some value @xmath7 such that maker wins the game for all @xmath8 , while breaker wins for @xmath9 ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "we call @xmath10 the _ threshold bias _ for that game .",
    "the biased games were first introduced and studied by chvtal and erds in  @xcite , and some thirty years later the papers of gebauer and szab  @xcite and krivelevich  @xcite finally located the leading term of the thresholds for the games of connectivity , perfect matching and hamilton cycle , which turned out to be @xmath11 for all three games .    moving on to the concept of fast winning , when we know that maker can win an unbiased game , a natural question that we can ask is  what is the minimum number of moves for maker to win ?",
    "questions of this type appeared frequently , often as subproblems , in classical papers on positional games , and the concept of fast maker s win was further formalized in  @xcite .",
    "it is not hard to see that maker can win the unbiased connectivity game as fast as the size of the winning set allows , in @xmath12 moves . for the other two games it takes him a bit longer ( one move longer , to be more precise )  he can win unbiased perfect matching game in @xmath13 moves ( for @xmath1 even )  @xcite , and unbiased hamilton cycle game in @xmath14 moves  @xcite , and in both cases that is the best he can do .",
    "we note that some research has also been done on fast maker s win in unbiased @xmath15-connectivity , perfect matching and hamilton cycle games played on the edge set of a random graph , see  @xcite .    knowing how fast maker can win , and how to win fast , is important , as this often helps us when looking at other positional games .",
    "indeed , there are numerous examples where a player s winning strategy may call for building a certain structure _ quickly _ before proceeding to another task . also , one of very few tools that proved to be useful when tackling the so - called strong positional games are the fast maker s winning strategies , see  @xcite .",
    "our goal in this paper is to combine the two presented concepts  the biased games and the fast winning , looking into the possibilities for maker to _ win fast in biased games_. in other words , given a game @xmath16 and a bias @xmath3 such that maker can win @xmath0 biased game , we want to know in how many moves he can win the game .",
    "one obvious lower bound for the duration of the game is the size of the smallest winning set , and that is @xmath12 for connectivity , @xmath17 for perfect matching , and @xmath1 for hamilton cycle .",
    "it is not hard to see that in connectivity game maker does not ever need to close a cycle , and therefore , even in the biased game , whenever he can win he can do so in exactly @xmath12 moves . as for perfect matching game ,",
    "the following theorem gives fast maker s win for most of the range of biases for which maker can win , up to the ( order of the ) threshold for maker s win in the game .",
    "[ thm : perfm ] there exist @xmath18 and @xmath19 such that for every @xmath20 , maker can win the @xmath0 perfect matching game played on @xmath6 within @xmath21 moves , for large enough @xmath1 .    moving on to hamilton cycle game",
    ", we can prove the following two results for fast maker s win .",
    "the first one is more powerful , but it applies only for small values of bias , while the second one covers a wider range of bias .",
    "[ thm : hamverysmall ] there exists @xmath19 such that for @xmath22 and @xmath23 , maker can win the @xmath0 hamilton cycle game game played on @xmath6 within @xmath24 moves , for large enough @xmath1 .",

    "finally , when the bias is large , we can apply the following result of krivelevich  @xcite , as it provides maker with a win within @xmath28 moves in hamilton cycle game , and thus also in perfect matching game .",
    "[ @xcite , theorem 1][thm : krivi ] maker can win the @xmath0 hamilton cycle game played on @xmath6 in at most @xmath28 moves , for every @xmath29 , for large enough @xmath1 .",
    "on the other hand , looking at the prospects of breaker to postpone maker s win , we can move away from the obvious lower bound in both perfect matching and hamilton cycle .",
    "[ thm : delay ] in @xmath0 maker - breaker game , for every bias @xmath3 , breaker can postpone maker s win    a.   in perfect matching game for at least @xmath30 moves , b.   in hamilton cycle game for at least @xmath31 moves .    to sum up ,",
    "if the number of moves maker needs to play in order to win in perfect matching game is denoted by @xmath32 , on the whole range of biases between @xmath33 and @xmath34 we have that @xmath35 , as given by theorem  [ thm : perfm ] , theorem  [ thm : krivi ] and theorem  [ thm : delay ]  ( i ) .    in hamilton cycle game , if we denote the number of moves maker needs to play in order to win by @xmath36 , then theorem  [ thm : hamverysmall ] , theorem  [ thm : hamsmall ] , theorem  [ thm : krivi ] and theorem  [ thm : delay ]  ( ii ) provide non - trivial upper and lower bounds for the whole range of biases between @xmath33 and @xmath34 . if we look at the value @xmath37 and express both the upper and lower bounds as functions of @xmath3 , the lower bound on the whole range is @xmath38 , while the upper bound varies between @xmath39 and @xmath40 , for any @xmath41 . in particular , for @xmath3 a constant , both upper and lower bounds are a constant .    finding the right order of magnitude of both @xmath42 and @xmath37 remains an open problem , and we are particularly curious if they are linear in @xmath3 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "after we list the notation we use , in section  [ sec::aux ] we collect some preliminaries .",
