    "hawley and stone ( 1996 ) have claimed , on the basis of theoretical and numerical studies , that keplerian disks are linearly and non - linearly stable .",
    "they rejected self - sustained hydrodynamical turbulence with outward angular momentum transport , because the turbulence can not gain energy from the differential rotation .",
    "however , @xcite suggested a steady hydrodynamical turbulence in keplerian disks , which are caused by the pressure - strain tensor .",
    "richard & zahn ( 1999 ) have re - analiezed laboratory experiments of the couette - taylor flow , and concluded that turbulence may be sustained by differential rotation when @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite showed that purely hydrodynamical perturbations can develop initially into either sheared disturbances or coherent vortices ( see also papaloizou & pringle 1985 ) .",
    "however , the perturbations decay and do not evolve into a self - sustained turbulence .",
    "another important mechanism that generates turbulence in a rotating disk is self - gravitational , local or global instability of the gas @xcite .",
    "although there are some simulations of self - gravitating , turbulent gas in a local shearing box ( e.g. v@xmath4zquez - semadeni et al .",
    "1995 ; gammie 2001 ) , the local approximation would not be adequate to study the nature of self - gravity dominated turbulence @xcite .",
    "the global hydrodynamical simulations given by @xcite have revealed spiral unstable modes in the differentially rotating disk , but the development of self - sustained turbulence was not observed .    in the this paper , we study the gravity - driven turbulence in galactic disks using two - dimensional , global hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "we solve the basic hydrodynamical equations and the poisson equation numerically , taking into account realistic radiative cooling .",
    "we use the same numerical technique discussed by wada & norman ( 1999,2001 ) ( hereafter wn99 , wn01 ) , in which kpc - scale dynamics of the multi - phase ism can be followed with a sub - pc resolution . wn99 and wn01 suggested that a gravitationally unstable and thermally unstable disk can evolve into a globally quasi - stable disk with quasi - stationary turbulent velocity field . here",
    "we perform simulations with a higher spatial resolution , and make a detailed analysis of the turbulent structure .    in  2 , we briefly summarize the numerical method and models , and in  3 , we show that turbulent energy spectra are achieved over a wide dynamic range ( from kpc to pc ) in the direct numerical experiments . in order to study the effects of pure turbulence in the disk",
    ", we here ignore the energy feedback due to supernovae and stellar winds from massive stars @xcite . in  4 , we discuss what is required for realistic models of the ism , and we apply our model to the hi disk of the dwarf galaxy , ngc 2915 . extended hi disks are particularly relevant objects to compare with our models , because they are not significantly affected by the star formation @xcite .",

    "the potential has two parameters , @xmath10 ( scale parameter called the ` core radius ' ) and @xmath11 ( the maximum rotation speed ) , and is expressed as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is given as @xmath14 , with @xmath15 km s@xmath16 and @xmath170.2 and 2 kpc .",
    "we also assume a cooling function @xmath18 @xmath19 with solar metallicity and a heating due to photoelectric heating , @xmath20 . a constant scale height ( @xmath21 pc )",
    "is assumed to calculate the cooling rate .",
    "we assume a uniform uv radiation field , equal to the the local galactic uv field @xcite .",
    "however , the uv heating does not significantly affect the dynamics of the ism .",
    "the hydrodynamic part of the basic equations is solved by ausm ( advection upstream splitting method ) , @xcite .",
    "we achieve third - order spatial accuracy with muscl @xcite .",
    "the limiter function is chosen to satisfy the tvd ( total variation diminishing ) condition . in this scheme ,",
    "an explicit numerical viscous term is not required and shocks are captured sharply .",
    "we used @xmath22 equally spaced cartesian grid points covering a 2 kpc @xmath23 2 kpc region around the galactic center .",
    "we also run models using @xmath24 and @xmath25 grid points to evaluate how numerical resolution affects the results .",
    "the poisson equation is solved to calculate the self - gravity of the gas using the fft and the convolution method @xcite .",
    "the second - order leap - frog method is used for the time integration .",
    "we adopt implicit time integration for the cooling term .",
    "the initial condition is an axisymmetric and rotationally supported disk assuming the toomre@xmath0 parameter , @xmath26 .",
    "random density and temperature fluctuations are added at each grid cell in the initial disk .",
    "these fluctuations are less than 1 % of the unperturbed values and have an approximately white noise ( flat power spectrum ) distribution .",
    "as described in wn01 , thermal and gravitational instabilities grow non - linearly over the whole of the disk in a few dynamical time scales .",
    "the whole system shows a quasi - stable state after @xmath27 myr ( 2 rotational periods at @xmath28 kpc ) . as shown in fig .",
    "1 , which is a density field of a part of the disk ( 500 pc @xmath29 500 pc , i.e. 1/16 of the entire simulated region ) , a complicated network of clumps and filaments as well as low density voids are formed .",
    "the density ranges from @xmath30 to @xmath31 @xmath32 pc@xmath33 . the velocity field in the same region in fig .",
    "1 is also very complicated as shown in fig .",
    "2a and 2b , in which @xmath34 and @xmath35 are plotted . comparing to fig . 1 and 2 , we see that regions of converging velocity roughly coincide with dense filaments , and positive and negative vortices are also associated with the filaments .",
    "this shows that local shearing motions are generated along the filaments .",
    "one should note that this turbulent velocity field is maintained in a rotating , self - gravitating gas disk without any explicit energy inputs , such as supernovae or any other artificial driving forces .    in order to understand the nature of the turbulent velocity field statistically",
    ", we calculate the energy spectra , @xmath36 from the velocity field , where @xmath37 is the wave number .",
    "we decompose the velocity field into two components , i.e. @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the compressible velocity field and @xmath40 is the incompressible ( or solenoidal ) field @xcite .",
    "the two components are defined from @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and solenoidal and compressible energy spectra , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are calculated from @xmath40 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "figure 3a shows the evolution of the compressible energy spectrum , @xmath44 .",
    "one finds that the compressible part of the velocity field reaches a quasi - steady state in a few rotational periods , where the spectrum shows a double power - law shape with a ` knee ' at @xmath45 ( @xmath46 pc ) .",
    "the kinetic energy is mainly driven at wavenumbers around @xmath47 .",
    "the turbulence inversely cascades to a larger scale ( @xmath48 ) , and simultaneously it also cascades to smaller scales .",
    "the input wave number , @xmath49 , corresponds to about 10 pc , which is the scale of the initial gravitational instability in the cool phase after the initial cooling .",
    "the inverse cascade implies a hierarchical growth of the gravitational instability in the disk .",
    "the energy spectrum of the solenoidal component @xmath43 similarly evolves as that @xmath44 does ( fig .",
    "3b ) , but it has more power especially on the large scale ( @xmath50 or @xmath51 pc ) because of the galactic rotation .",
    "the appearance of the ` hump ' at @xmath52 at @xmath53 myr and the following evolution suggest that eddies are generated on the same scale as the gravitational instability , and they propagate toward large and small scales . the rotational energy on a larger scale cascades downward at @xmath54 .",
    "this process is just like evolution of the gravitational instability in a rotating disk @xcite .",
    "we discuss this below .",
    "a stationary power - law regime in the energy spectrum of the system implies a fully - developed turbulence , and its power - law index represents some statistical aspects of the turbulence . before discussing the power - law indices and the range of the inertial cascade , we first check the simulation for numerical artifacts .",
    "since the turbulence of the ism is a phenomenon over a wide dynamic range , one should be careful about fitting the numerically obtained spectrum with a power - law .",
    "we are using a non - adaptive eulerian grid , therefore the results on smaller scales can be affected by the numerical resolution .",
    "we therefore check the dependence of the turbulent spectrum on the resolution by using @xmath25 and @xmath24 grid points as well as the @xmath22 grid points ( i.e. 0.49 pc resolution ) . in fig . 4 ,",
    "@xmath55 for three cases using @xmath56 and @xmath24 grid points at @xmath57 are plotted .",
    "we find that 1 ) the three runs coincide at @xmath48 within a factor of two , 2 ) the slopes of the ` inertial ranges ' are the same @xmath58 , and 3 ) the power - law indices of the ` dissipation regions ' in the all three models approach to @xmath59 .",
    "the positions of the ` knees ' are shifted by about factor of two , therefore the inertial range is increased by a factor of two if we use twice the number of grid points .",
    "therefore , we can safely conclude that the slope of the inertial range is not strongly affected by the spatial resolution .",
    "in fully developed kolmogorov incompressible turbulence , the steady power - law energy spectrum indicates a steady energy flow from large scales toward smaller scales . in two - dimensional , incompressible , hydrodynamical turbulence , stationary spectra",
    "are found to be proportional to @xmath60 for @xmath61 ( enstrophy , ( i.e. squared vorticity ) cascade regime ) and to @xmath62 for @xmath63 ( energy ` inverse ' cascade regime ) , where @xmath64 is the forcing wavenumber @xcite .",
    "this inverse energy cascade is also observed in numerical simulations of a weakly compressible 2-d turbulence @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the spectrum in fig .",
    "3a look consistent with the kraichnan s picture , with @xmath65 , although our spectrum is shallower ( @xmath66 ) in the inertial range than the kraichnan s prediction .    in fig . 5 ,",
    "the final energy spectra ( @xmath67 myr ) , @xmath36 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 for the model using @xmath22 grid points are plotted .",
    "@xmath44 has a power - law part @xmath68 between @xmath69 and 200 , and @xmath70 between @xmath71 and 200 .",
    "it is known that for shock - dominated , fully - developed turbulence , @xmath72 , and for a weakly shocked turbulence , @xmath73 are expected @xcite .",
    "the present spectrum is shallower than these values , and it implies that the structure of velocity field is not determined only by shocks .",
    "however , it is not clear whether this difference originates from the complexity of the present system , i.e. a non - uniform , rotating , self - gravitating , and radiative turbulence .",
    "even so , it is interesting that the resultant spectra in this complicated system show stationary power laws over inertial ranges as seen in the much simpler systems - uniform , non - selfgravitating , and non - radiative turbulence .",
    "note that the slope will change if the simulations are generalized to include energy feedback from supernovae , which cause strong shocks in the ism ( wn01 ) .",
    "next , we show energy spectra for two models with different rotation curves , i.e. rigid and differential rotation curves ( @xmath74 and @xmath75 kpc ) in fig .",
    "the plot shows that the spectra of the rigid rotation model on large scales ( @xmath76 ) are smaller than those of the differential rotation model by a factor @xmath77 .",
    "on the other hand , the difference of the spectra between the two models are a factor @xmath78 on small scales ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "interestingly , the spectra of the inertial range in the rigid rotation model are steeper ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "it is reasonable that energy extracted from the galactic rotation is more effective when there is a shear field .",
    "we discuss this more quantitatively below .",
    "the above numerical results suggest that the ism in galaxies is dynamic , but in a statistical sense , it is in a ` quasi - steady state ' , whose velocity field resembles fully developed turbulence over a wide dynamic range ( at least three orders of magnitude ) .",
    "the expected velocity dispersions are @xmath81 km s@xmath16 and 0.1 km s@xmath16 for 100 pc and 1 pc scales , respectively .",
    "there are two obvious energy sources that can maintain the turbulence in this system : the shear - driven by the galactic rotation and local tidal field due to the self - gravity of the gas .",
    "besides these , local pressure gradients can also contribute to generate the turbulence .",
    "this is because that the turbulent ism is no longer in pressure equilibrium ( wn01 , gazol et al .",
    "2001 ) . as shown by the energy spectra ( fig .",
    "5 ) , the rotational energy is dominated by that on a large scale ( @xmath82 pc ) . on the other hand ,",
    "turbulence is first driven by the self - gravity of the gas on a scale of 1020 pc as seen in fig .",
    "3 . these energy inputs are in equilibrium with the energy transport due to turbulent decay and losses due to the radiative cooling .    in order to see the effect of the gravitational instability on the generation of the turbulence",
    ", we calculate the _ effective _ toomre stability parameter @xmath83 , where the effective velocity dispersion , @xmath84 , is defined by @xmath85 with the velocity dispersion @xmath86 and the sound velocity @xmath87 , the average surface gas density @xmath88 and , the epicyclic frequency , @xmath89 .",
    "all quantities are averaged in local subregions ( 1 kpc@xmath90 and @xmath91 ) .",
    "7 shows the volume - weighted distribution functions of the @xmath92 for three different snapshots .",
    "it is notable that @xmath0 is distributed over a wide range , i.e. four - orders of magnitudes . at @xmath93 myr ,",
    "a large fraction of the volume is in the unstable ( @xmath94 ) state .",
    "note that , although the @xmath95 implies that the axisymmetric mode is linearly unstable , the disk can be unstable to non - axisymmetric modes even with @xmath96 .",
    "the peaks shift to larger values for later times , which means the disk is stabilized . at @xmath97 myr ,",
    "the median is @xmath98 , and the regions where @xmath99 and @xmath100 coexist .",
    "this situation is clearly seen in fig .",
    "8 , which shows the 2-d distribution of @xmath92 and @xmath101 at @xmath97 myr .",
    "the distribution of the stable ( yellow - white ) and unstable regions ( dark red - blue - black ) are very patchy .",
    "it is obvious that the unstable regions correspond to high density regions , which are seen in the density map colored red - yellow .",
    "the disk is more unstable in the outer region ( @xmath102 kpc ) than in the inner region .",
    "the density map shows some global spiral structures , which can be also seen in the @xmath0 map .",
    "the inhomogeneous distribution of @xmath0 appears in the initial a few rotations , and then they evolve into larger structure .",
    "this evolution represents the development of the inhomogeneous structure in density , and the evolution of @xmath36 as shown in fig .",
    "3 is consistent with this result .",
    "the most unstable wave length @xmath103 in the differentially rotating disk is @xmath104330 pc .",
    "this is consistent with the typical size of the unstable regions seen in fig .",
    "8 , which is less than about 50 pc .",
    "the sizes of the unstable regions are larger than those of the dissipational region seen in the energy spectra ( fig .",
    "5 ) , therefore the patchy structure is not strongly affected by the numerical resolution .",
    "the ism in the @xmath94 regions are expected to be collapsed , but this does not mean that all gas components in each unstable region eventually turn into _ one _ high density clump .",
    "in fact , there are substructures in the unstable regions , therefore due to the local angular momentum , the pressure gradient , and the coriolis force , the collapse can not be monotonic . as a result",
    ", the gravitational contraction causes the local velocity dispersion and shock heating , then the regions are stabilized . on the other hand , the stable regions can become unstable due to mass inflow and radiative cooling .",
    "therefore the local structure of the stable and unstable regions are time - dependent , but the entire patchy structure seen in fig . 8 does not change , which is consistent with fact that the energy spectra do not evolve significantly once the system reach the quasi - steady state .",
    "the above results imply that the origin of the turbulent motion in the multi - phase , differentially rotating disk is gravitational instability .",
    "what we observe here is just like the ` local ' gravitational instabilities in a rotating disk as discussed by goldreich & lynden - bell ( 1965a , b ) , although the gas disks here have much more complicated multi - phase structures .",
    "the turbulence is driven by the gravitational instabilities , and probably it is also supplied by energy extracted from the galactic rotation .",
    "this is the same mechanism that drives the mhd turbulence .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , the energy supply rate is given by @xmath105 , where the stress tensor is expressed using alfven velocity @xmath106 and gravitational velocity @xmath107 as @xmath108 ( see also lynden - bell & kalnajis 1972 ) . therefore , even if there is no magnetic field , the gravitational stress tensor works to extract energy from the galactic rotation .",
    "the energy supply rate due to the gravitational instability per unit mass can be estimated as @xmath109 ( where @xmath110 is a scale length of the turbulence ) and @xmath9 is the scale height of the disk . the time scale of the energy supply , i.e. @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the rotational period , is long enough compared to the galactic life time . in other words , the turbulence can be sustained using a small fraction of the galactic potential energy . the dependence of the energy supply rate on the wavelength can be derived roughly as @xmath113 for the kepler rotation ( @xmath114 ) or @xmath115 for the rigid rotation . since the turbulent energy dissipation rate per unit mass should have the same dependence on the turbulent scale as the energy supply rate does , @xmath116 , or @xmath117 . as a result , we expect that @xmath118 for the kepler rotation , or @xmath72 for the rigid rotation . that is , the power spectrum is steeper in the rigid rotation case than in the differentially rotating case as we see in fig . 6 .",
    "one should note that the turbulence extracts energy from the galactic rotation through self - gravity , and the galactic global shear is not a necessary condition to sustain the turbulence .",
    "in addition to the local instability in self - gravitating disks , interactions with the non - axisymmetric disturbance , such as spiral density waves , can be a mechanism to redistribute energy from the background shear to the local disturbance through the @xmath119 term in the stress tensor @xcite .",
    "this has an analogy with the swing amplification of spiral density waves in differentially rotating , stellar disks @xcite . as seen in fig .",
    "8 , global spiral density waves evolve in the inhomogeneous disks after a few rotational times .",
    "modeling the ism on a galactic scale is a challenging problem in numerical astrophysics .",
    "it is required that realistic simulations include many elementary processes , such as various radiative cooling / heating processes , thermal conduction , interaction between the magnetic field and the ism , self - gravity of the gas , energy feedback from supernovae , etc . moreover",
    ", the simulations should be ultimately three - dimensional and global , that is the whole galactic disk should be solved . in this sense ,",
    "our model and any other past numerical simulations of the ism are still highly idealized ( see a review by v@xmath4zquez - semadeni 2002 ) .",
    "our model is global , and realistic radiative cooling and self - gravity of the gas are taken into account , but the magnetic field , which is important for the evolution of the interstellar turbulence ( see references in  1 ) , is ignored .",
    "therefore we should be careful to apply the present results to the real ism .",
    "on the other hand , most mhd simulations of the ism adopt the local shearing box approximation .",
    "there are many local 2-d models , e.g. self - gravitating ism with radiative cooling ( vazquez - semadeni et al . 1996 ) , and self - gravitating ism with isothermal or adiabatic equation of state @xcite .",
    "some models in 3-d consider radiative cooling and supernova feedback @xcite , but most of them are local , non - selfgravitating , and an isothermal equation of state ( eos ) is assumed @xcite .",
    "there was some global , 3-d mhd simulations with polytropic eos calculated for the galactic central region , but they ignored self - gravity of the gas ( e.g. machida , hayashi , & matsumoto 2000 ) .",
    "using self - gravitating , global hydrodynamical simulations with radiative cooling , on the other hand , wada ( 2001 ) showed that the ism in the galactic central region has the complicated filamentary , multi - phase structure as seen in the 2-d simulations presented here .",
    "the results in the present paper and the past attempts are complementary , and they should be improved with more consistent numerical modeling of the ism in the future .",
    "finally we would like to comment on plausibility of the 2-d approximation for the ism .",
    "the real ism in a galactic disk should behave as three - dimensional turbulence below the scale height of the cold gas ( @xmath120 pc ) .",
    "since the turbulence is driven by local gravitational instability , we expect that the ism in 3-d behaves like 2-d turbulence on larger scales , therefore the inertial range of @xmath121 would also appear for @xmath122 in 3-d ( @xmath123 in 2-d ) . for @xmath124 ,",
    "the energy spectrum would be kolmogorov - like , i.e. @xmath125 , or if it is shock - dominated , @xmath72 would be expected . in a real ism on a smaller scale , the main energy sources would be magneto - hydrodynamical instability and/or energy feedback from stars as well as the energy decay from larger scales .",
    "transition from 2-d to 3-d turbulence and its effect on the energy spectra are now important problems that can be addressed in studies of the gas dynamics in galactic disks , this would be clarified utilizing three - dimensional , global simulations of the ism with magnetic field on a galactic scale .",
    "one might wonder if the spatial resolution in our simulation is meaninglessly fine ( i.e. @xmath126 pc ) , if we apply the model to the real ism whose scale height is @xmath120 pc .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "4 , the transition from the inertia range to the ` dissipative ' part is affected by the numerical resolution . the maximum wave length of the inertia range is about 10 times larger than the grid size . therefore even for 2-d simulations",
    ", the spatial resolution should be much finer than the assumed scale heigh of the disk .",
    "the hi disk in the dwarf galaxy , ngc 2915 , extends to over five times the holmberg radius , and there is no active star formation observed outside the central region .",
    "therefore , this galaxy is relevant to our study of the dynamics of the turbulent gas disk without the influence of the stellar energy feedback .",
    "meurer , mackie , & carignan ( 1994 ) and meurer et al .",
    "( 1996 ) observed ngc 2915 ( @xmath127 mpc , @xmath128 mag , @xmath129 kpc ) using the atca ( australia telescope compact array ) with a linear resolution is 640 pc and the aat ( anglo - astrallia telescope ) .",
    "the total mass of the hi disk is @xmath130 and @xmath131 kpc . the integrated star - formation rate is 0.05 @xmath132 yr@xmath16 , and most of the star - formation is near the center of the galaxy .",
    "the hi intensity map shows that there are spiral arms extending well beyond the optical extent .",
    "the isovelocity contours show that the disk is rotating with a small amount of non - circular motion .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity dispersion of the hi is @xmath133 km s@xmath16 inside the optical radius , and it is @xmath134 km s@xmath16 in the extended hi disk . the central question is what causes this large velocity dispersion in the extended hi disk ?",
    "we apply the same numerical method in  2 to model the hi disk in ngc 2915 to obtain the radial distribution of the velocity dispersion in a non - star forming disk .",
    "we scale the potential model ( eq.(5 ) ) and the gas disk to represent the hi disk of ngc 2915 .",
    "two rotation curves are assumed for an axisymmetric component of the external potential : 1 ) the potential derived from the hi rotation curve ( model a in fig .",
    "16 of meurer et al . 1996 ) , where the core radius @xmath10 in eq.(5 ) is 4 kpc , and 2 ) models with a smaller core radius ( @xmath74 kpc ) .",
    "the latter model was chosen , because the hi rotation curves derived from tracing peak intensities of position - velocity maps do not necessarily represent _ true _ mass distribution of the galaxies , especially for the central part @xcite .",
    "sofue et al .",
    "( 1999 ) claimed that the true central rotation curves tend to be steeper than those implied from the peak intensities in pv maps .",
    "ngc 2915 has a central optical bar .",
    "the observed spiral patterns could be resonance - driven structures by this central bar .",
    "the velocity dispersion in the disk is generally enhanced by the non - axisymmetric potential and its resonances .",
    "the pattern speed of the bar can be directly measured @xcite , and it is @xmath135 km s@xmath16 kpc@xmath16 @xcite . in order to investigate the effects of the central bar , we also performed runs with a non - axisymmetric potential ( bar - potential ) with the same pattern speed as observed ( bureau et al .",
    "1999 ) , and where the length of the bar is taken to be equal to the core radius @xmath10 .",

    "we find that the dispersion is about a factor 4 smaller than the observed value ( 20 - 40 km s@xmath16 ) at @xmath147 kpc , a factor 2 smaller than the observed 8 km s@xmath16 at @xmath148 kpc .",

    "10 shows @xmath36 for the two models @xmath142 and @xmath149 .",
    "both spectra show double power - law shapes , @xmath118 and @xmath153 in @xmath154 for models @xmath142 and @xmath149 , respectively .",
    "the slope of the axisymmetric model is comparable to that in fig .",
    "5 . the steeper slope in the bar model would be due to stronger shocks caused by the bar .",
    "the spectra also shows that the bar model has a factor of 2 - 10 larger energy than the axisymmetric model in the most scales .    in fig .",
    "11 and 12 , we plot the density and pv maps of the bar model @xmath149 .",
    "two major spiral arms , which are formed from many spirals and clumps , are evident as well as an inhomogeneous compact disk .",
    "the pv diagram shows a large velocity dispersion at @xmath155 kpc , which corresponds to the clumpy nuclear disk .",
    "the toomre s @xmath0 parameter estimated by the observations is 59 @xcite .",
    "however , this does _ not _ mean that there are no local gravitationally unstable regions in the hi disk .",
    "the beam size in the observations is much larger than the typical size of the unstable regions .",
    "therefore , we can observe the global stability of the hi disk , but probably the local instability is observed as the velocity dispersion in the beam size .",
    "after exploring the parameter space ( @xmath156 , and @xmath10 ) , we conclude that a set of parameters , i.e. @xmath157 km s@xmath16 kpc@xmath16 , and @xmath158 kpc , reasonably reproduces the observed radial distribution of the velocity dispersion , and the hi morphology",
    ". however , the observed value of the velocity dispersion in the extended disk is about factor two larger than that in the best - fit model @xmath149 .",
    "this might be due to the limitation of our model (  4.1 ) , or because of the following reasons .",
    "10 suggests that stronger bars can enhance the velocity dispersion in the disk by about factor of two .",
    "if the observed velocity dispersion is a result of _ hidden _ gravitational instability in the hi disk , the dispersion could be larger in a more massive disk .",
    "that is , the observed hi mass does not necessarily represent the total mass of the gas in the galaxy .",
    "there might be a component of high density , compact molecular clouds in the extended hi disk , which could be observed by the next - generation radio interferometer , alma .",
    "dynamics and structure of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in galactic disks are numerically studied , using high - resolution , 2-d hydrodynamical simulations with a large dynamic range . in  3 , we showed that the velocity fields of the ism in a steady - state show turbulent - like spectral energy distributions which are natural consequences of the non - linear development of gravitational instabilities of the ism .",
    "the energy spectra are obtained over three - orders of magnitude in the wave number .",
    "the model using @xmath22 grid points shows that the spectrum for the compressible and incompressible ( solenoidal ) part of the velocity field in the inertia ranges are fitted approximately as @xmath159 and @xmath160 , respectively .",
    "we found that the turbulent energy spectra are achieved in a few dynamical time - scales , and they subsequently remain in a quasi - steady state .",
    "we do not include energy feedback from supernovae or other external driving forces to produce and maintain turbulence .",
    "the turbulence is self - maintained over the wide dynamic range . from analyzing the temporal evolution of the energy spectra and the density structure",
    ", we suspect that energy input from self - gravitational interaction of the ism and the galactic rotation drives the turbulence balancing the turbulent energy decay and the radiative cooling .    in  4",
    ", we compared our global ism models with hi observations of ngc 2915 . a large velocity dispersion ( @xmath134 km s@xmath16 ) is observed in the extended hi disk of ngc 2915 , even though there is no active star formation .",
    "we found that the observed velocity dispersion and its radial distribution in ngc 2915 can be quantitatively understood as the gravity - driven turbulence , but the galactic potential requires an additional non - axisymmetric potential with a rotation speed of @xmath161 km s@xmath16 kpc@xmath16 or the total gas mass should be larger than the observed hi mass .",
