    "recently , much attention has been paid to the magnetic connection ( mc ) of a rotating black hole ( bh ) with its surrounding accretion disc ( blandford 1999 ; li 2000a ; wang , xiao & lei 2002 , wang et al . 2003 , hereafter w02 and w03 , respectively ) . the mc process can be regarded as one of the variants of the blandford - znajek ( bz ) process proposed near three decades ago ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) , which involves the closed magnetic field lines connecting a bh with its surrounding disc .",
    "this mechanism has been used to explain a very steep emissivity in the inner region of the disc , which is consistent with the _ xmm - newton _ observation of the nearby bright seyfert1 galaxy mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ( wilms 2001 ; li 2002a ; w03 ) .",
    "blandford ( 2002 ) described several electromagnetic ways to extract the rotational energy associated with a spinning bh , in which the mc between the plunging region and the disc ( hereafter mcpd ) is included .",
    "however , mcpd has not been discussed in detail in the previous work , and the origin of these magnetic field configurations remains unclear .",
    "recently , li ( 2002b , hereafter l02 ) discussed the mc between the bh horizon and the disc ( hereafter mchd ) by assuming a toroidal electric current @xmath2 flowing on a circle of @xmath3 in the equatorial plane of a kerr bh , i.e. ,    @xmath4    the metric around a kerr bh is given in boyer - lindquist coordinates ( macdonald and thorne 1982 , hereafter mt82 )    @xmath5    where the concerned kerr metric parameters are defined as    @xmath6    in equation ( [ eq3 ] ) @xmath7 is the specific angular momentum of the bh , which is related to the bh mass @xmath8 , angular momentum @xmath9 and spin @xmath10 by @xmath11 .    not long ago , li ( 2000b , hereafter l00 ) discussed a scenario of extracting energy from a kerr bh through the plunging region , where the open magnetic field lines connect plasma particles with remote loads .",
    "it is argued in l00 that the energy extracted from the particles can be so large that the particles have negative energy as they fall into the bh , if the magnetic field is strong enough .    motivated by the above works",
    ", we propose a scenario of extracting energy from a kerr bh based on the magnetic field configuration arising from a toroidal electric current @xmath2 flowing at the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) .",
    "the magnetic field configuration contains both mchd and mcpd , being constrained by the conservation of magnetic flux and a criterion of the screw instability of the magnetic field .",
    "it is shown that mcpd is more important than mchd in transferring energy and angular momentum to the disc for low bh spins .",
    "it turns out that negative energy can be delivered to the bh by the plunging particles without violating the second law of bh thermodynamics , however it can not be realized via mcpd in a stable way .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in @xmath12 2",
    "we present a description of our model , in which mchd and mcpd coexist in a large - scale magnetic field generated by a toroidal electric current flowing at isco . in @xmath12 3",
    "we calculate and compare the powers and torques in mchd and mcpd . in @xmath12 4",
    "the condition of negative energy of plunging particles is studied in based on some reasonable constraints : ( i ) a positive accretion rate , ( ii ) an increasing bh entropy , ( iii ) a stationary accretion and ( iv ) a stable energy extraction for the plunging particles . in @xmath12 5 we compare the efficiencies of releasing energy arising from disc accretion , mchd and mcpd .",
    "finally , in @xmath12 6 , we summarize our main results , and discuss some issues related to our model . throughout this paper",
    "the geometric units @xmath13 are used .",
    "it is assumed that the magnetic field in the neighborhood of the bh and its surrounding disc is ideally conducting and force - free , and the magnetic field , electric field and other quantities are measured by zero - angular - momentum observers defined by bardeen , press & teukolsky ( 1972 ) . the magnetic field configuration produced by a toroidal current flowing at the inner edge of the disc as shown in figure 1 , which contains both mchd and mcpd . in this paper",

    "the motion of the plunging particles is very different from that in the disc .",
    "the velocity of the radial inflow in the disc is much smaller than the keplerian velocity , while the radial velocity of plunging particles is comparable to the keplerian velocity .",
    "the motion of plunging particles becomes even more complicated in the presence of large - scale magnetic fields . in this paper , instead of resolving mhd equations in the plunging region , we introduce a parameter @xmath0 to describe the mcpd effect on the motion of the plunging particles .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the accreting matter mainly consists of electrons and protons .",
    "considering the toroidal motion of the accreting electrons and protons in the plunging region and the magnetic field configuration in figure 1 , we infer that the electrons of negative charge and the protons of positive charge are accelerated inwards and decelerated outwards by lorentz force , respectively .",
    "thus a current is driven outwards in the plunging region by lorentz force .",
    "this situation is analogous to those in the bz process and in mchd , where a current is driven in the longitudinal direction at the horizon due to the bh rotation relative to a poloidal large - scale magnetic field ( mt82 ; w02 ; w03 ) .",

    "it is noted that the sign of @xmath224 is negative , and the mcpd correction to the accretion rate depends on both the sign and magnitude of @xmath225 .",
    "since @xmath226 depends on the disc radius , the accretion rate expressed by equation ( [ eq59 ] ) varies with the disc radius , which might give rise to an unstable accretion disc .",
    "fortunately , the viscous force can adjust itself to compensate for the excessive transfer of angular momentum by magnetic torque and keep the accretion rate constant . how to constrain the concerning parameters to ensure a stable accretion disc ?",
    "we shall deal with this issue based on the transfer of angular momentum in the disc .",
    "the flux of angular momentum @xmath227 is transferred from the plunging region to the disc , and it is related to @xmath188 by @xmath228 .",
    "based on the conservation of energy and angular momentum page & thorne ( 1974 ) derived the rate of angular momentum transferred by the viscous torque in the disc as follows ,    @xmath229    where @xmath230 and @xmath231 are the specific energy and angular momentum of the accreting particles , respectively .",
    "the quantity @xmath232 can be regarded as the first term at rhs of equation ( [ eq59 ] ) , and the function @xmath233 is related to the radiation flux @xmath234 given by page & thorne ( 1974 ) .",
    "being required by a stationary accretion , the rate of angular momentum transferred by the viscous torque should be no less than that due to mcpd , i.e. ,    @xmath235    based on equation ( [ eq62 ] ) and ( [ eq63 ] ) we have the condition for a stationary accretion as follows ,    @xmath236    where the function @xmath237 is evaluated at @xmath137 .",
    "another constraint to the accretion rate is given based on a stable extraction of energy .",
    "the accretion rate must be great enough to keep a stable magnetic extraction of energy from the plunging particles .",
    "as a rough estimate , the decreasing rate of the plunging particles kinetic energy can be written as    @xmath238\\dot { m}_d , \\ ] ]    which should be no less than the mcpd power at any position of the plunging region .",
    "considering the fact that the plunging particles energy can not be extracted completely via mcpd , we suggest the condition for a stable energy extraction as follows ,    @xmath239    where @xmath240 is the mcpd power integrated to the position at @xmath241 .",
    "thus the condition ( [ eq66 ] ) can be rewritten as    @xmath242      not long ago , l00 discussed the possibility of negative energy carried by accreting particles onto a bh due to the magnetic extraction of energy to the remote loads .",
    "an interesting issue is whether negative energy can be realized via mcpd .",
    "we are going to discuss this possibility with the constraints based on several physical considerations .",
    "following l00 , we have the condition for the negative energy of the plunging particles as follows ,    @xmath243    where @xmath244 is the rate of the net energy brought into the bh by the plunging particles .",

    "the region above the thick solid line and the dot - dashed line is indicated `` stable accretion and energy extraction '' , in which energy extraction via mcpd can work in a stable way .",
    "thus we conclude , although the negative energy can be delivered to the bh via mcpd with the validity of the second law of the bh thermodynamics , it can not be realized in a stable way in our model .",
    "although mchd and mcpd are related to the magnetic field configuration supported by a toroidal current flowing on the equatorial plane of the kerr bh , these two mechanisms are different in several aspects .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) energy and angular momentum are extracted and transferred from the kerr bh to the disc by virtue of mchd , while those are extracted and transferred from the plunging particles to the inner disc by virtue of mcpd .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) mchd can work in a suspended accretion state as suggested by van putten & ostriker ( 2001 ) , while mcpd can not operate without continuous replenishment of accreting particles .",

    "in this toy model the magnetic field configuration is generated by a single electric current flowing at isco of a thin disc , and we regard this as a starting point for dealing with the magnetic field configuration generated by the electric current distributed in more realistic way around a bh .",
    "we concentrate the discussion on the magnetic extraction of energy and angular momentum from the plunging particles , and we describe our model phenomenally by using two parameters instead of resolving the extremely complicated mhd equations within isco .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 is used to describe the angular velocity of the plunging particles , and the parameter @xmath1 is invoked to adjust the accretion rate affected by mcpd .",
    "it is noted that the parameters @xmath10 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are crucial for a stable mcpd process , although the mcpd power and torque are independent of the parameter @xmath1 according to equations ( [ eq49])([eq51 ] ) .",
    "the key point in this model is how to constrain these parameters based on some reasonable considerations . in this model",
    "four requirements are given : ( i ) a positive accretion rate , ( ii ) an increasing bh entropy , ( iii ) a stationary accretion and ( iv ) a stable energy extraction for the plunging particles .",
    "required by these constraints the following results are obtained in our model .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) mcpd could be more important than mchd in transferring energy and angular momentum to the disc . as shown in figures 46 , the power and torque in mcpd are stronger than those in mchd for low bh spins .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) although negative energy can be delivered to the bh by the plunging particles with the increasing bh entropy it can not be realized via mcpd in a stable way as shown in figure 7 .",
    "the efficiency of releasing energy due to mcpd could be greater than that due to mchd for low bh spins , while it is generally less than the efficiency of disc accretion for a wide range of @xmath10 and @xmath0 as shown in figure 9 .",
    "it is assumed in @xmath12 2.2 that the toroidal current located at @xmath16 has a very small circular section of radius @xmath277 , and @xmath278 is taken in calculations .",
    "the parameter @xmath71 is introduced to avoid an infinite magnetic field as @xmath68close to the toroidal current . the magnetic field outside @xmath65",
    "are not affected by the value of @xmath279 , while the contribution of the magnetic field to the mcpd effects can be neglected if @xmath71 is small enough .",
    "thus the influences of @xmath71 on the mcpd effects are very little .",
    "for example , required by @xmath280with @xmath281=0.294 , we have @xmath282=0.6187569089 , 0.6187569092 and 0.6187569342 for @xmath71= 10@xmath283 , 10@xmath284 and 10@xmath285 , respectively .",
    "the variation of @xmath0 arising from that of @xmath71 is @xmath286 .",
    "another issue related to our model lies in prescription ( [ eq44 ] ) , in which the surface resistivity of the plunging region is assumed to be @xmath287 .",
    "the resistivity @xmath288 is defined such that the electric field at the bh horizon is equal in magnitude to the magnetic field .",
    "we can show that the prescription ( [ eq44 ] ) does not lead to the result that the electric field at the surface of the plunging region is greater than the magnetic field there .",
    "the toroidal component of the magnetic field at the surface of the disc is expressed by equation ( [ eq25 ] ) .",
    "similarly , we can derive the expressions for the toroidal magnetic field at the surface of the plunging region as follows ,    @xmath289    the toroidal electric field is zero in a stationary axisymmetric magnetosphere ( mt82 ) , while the poloidal electric field at the surface of the plunging region is related to @xmath290 by ohm s law , i.e. ,    @xmath291    where @xmath292 is the electric field converted to a ` per unit globe time ' basis ( mt82 ) .",
    "incorporating equations ( [ eq25 ] ) and ( [ eq72 ] ) we have    @xmath293    thus the prescription ( [ eq44 ] ) leads to @xmath294 and @xmath295 .    in this paper we do not fit the very steep emissivity",
    "observed in some bh systems , such as galaxy mcg-6 - 30 - 15 .",
    "in fact , a very steep emissivity can be also produced by virtue of mcpd , since the energy and angular momentum transferred from the plunging region are very concentrated in the inner disc .",
    "we shall work out a more realistic model to relate mcpd to the observations in our future work .",
