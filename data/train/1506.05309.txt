    "the equilibrium interfacial tension between two coexisting fluid phases is a well established concept of enormous relevance to numerous research areas such as capillarity , wetting , the morphology of drops and bubbles , interface dynamics , and the adsorption of surfactant molecules or colloidal particles at interfaces @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that the equilibrium interfacial tension can be equivalently viewed either mechanically in terms of the difference of the normal and the transversal pressure tensor components or thermodynamically via the work required to reversibly deform the system in such a way that the interfacial area is changed while the system volume is preserved @xcite .",
    "both interpretations require the notion of the position of the interface , i.e. , of the non - uniform part of the system , which can be defined via the concept of a gibbs dividing interface @xcite .",
    "however , it can be shown that the value of the equilibrium interfacial tension between two fluid phases is independent of the choice of the gibbs dividing interface @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the general concept of an interfacial tension in non - equilibrium situations , e.g. , a non - equilibrium interface between two coexisting equilibrium bulk phases or an interface between two bulk phases being not at coexistence with each other , has not been uniquely established yet .",
    "several attempts have been made to extend the notion of an interfacial tension to non - equilibrium systems in order to interpret dynamic phenomena at interfaces @xcite .",
    "the approaches range from time - resolved interfacial tension measurements @xcite via integrations of the gibbs equation @xcite to capillary wave analyses @xcite .",
    "the overall assumption underlying all these non - equilibrium interfacial tensions is that of a sufficiently weakly perturbed equilibrium interface .",
    "in fact , it has been shown recently that the interfacial structure between two fluid bulk phases not in thermodynamic equilibrium with each other converges rapidly towards that of the equilibrium interface between the two coexisting bulk phases at the same temperature @xcite .",
    "hence , different notions of dynamic interfacial tensions can be expected to coincide quantitatively provided they do so for equilibrium interfaces .",
    "however , unlike for equilibrium interfaces , the value of the non - equilibrium interfacial tension depends on the choice of the gibbs dividing interface @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that the interfacial tension of equilibrium fluid - fluid interfaces is strictly positive because otherwise the interface would be unstable with respect to capillary wave fluctuations .",
    "the aim of the present work is to demonstrate that this is not necessarily the case for non - equilibrium interfacial tensions . to that end",
    ", the relaxation of an initial non - uniformity of a fluid deep inside the one - phase region of the phase diagram is considered . under these conditions",
    "the equilibrium state is uniform , i.e. , no equilibrium interface exists . therefore , the initial non - uniformity , i.e. , the interface , is a purely non - equilibrium structure , which ultimately vanishes during relaxation towards equilibrium .",
    "the present analysis is based on the notion of a non - equilibrium interfacial tension similar to the thermodynamic definition related to the work of reversible isochoric deformations .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that this notion of a non - equilibrium interfacial tension is not only consistent with the equilibrium interfacial tension but also useful in the context of interfaces between phases separated by a fluid - fluid phase transition . in order to avoid the difficulty due to the dependence of the non - equilibrium interfacial tension on the choice of the gibbs dividing interface , setups are considered for which the cross - sections of the system perpendicular to one spatial direction ( @xmath0-axis ) are all congruent . for such setups the number density profiles of the fluid vary only along the @xmath0-axis and",
    "the interfacial area equals the area of any of the congruent cross - sections .",
    "then locating the interface position is not necessary .    in order to apply the definition of the non - equilibrium interfacial tension as the work due to a reversible isochoric deformation in practice",
    ", the deformation has to be performed faster than the relaxation of the fluid under consideration .",
    "however , this is not possible in practice for simple fluids , since deformations have to be induced by deformations of the container walls , from where they propagate into the fluid via particle - particle interactions",
    ". hence reversible deformations of a simple fluid can not be achieved on time scales faster than the relaxations .",
    "one way out of this dilemma is to consider fluids of colloidal particles which are dispersed in a molecular solvent .",
    "in that situation , deformations of the container walls induce deformations of the molecular solvent which propagate on time scales much shorter than the relaxation time of the colloids .",
    "hence the solvent is the tool that exerts the force generated by the container walls onto the colloidal particles , which are considered as the fluid to be studied .",
