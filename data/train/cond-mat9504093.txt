    "simple spin models can have surprisingly complex phase structures , even at zero temperature .",
    "in particular , near multiphase lines , along which the ground state is infinitely degenerate , a perturbation such as temperature [ ] , quantum fluctuations [ ] or softening of the spins [ ] can result in infinite sequences of stable phases .",
    "the existence of upsilon - points ( @xmath0-points ) in frenkel - kontorova models has been pointed out recently [ , ] .",
    "these occur when two multiphase lines meet at a first - order boundary .",
    "a small perturbation about such a point can stabilise an infinite checkerboard structure of commensurate phases as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : upsi ] . in many ways",
    "the @xmath0-point can be thought of as a two - dimensional generalisation of the behaviour customary near a multiphase point .",
    "the occurrence of an @xmath0-point in a spin model was recently suggested by the numeric work of sasaki [ ] . here we present the first analytic evidence for the existence of a @xmath0-point in a spin model .",
    "the system we consider is the chiral xy model with 6-fold spin anisotropy in a magnetic field [ ] .",
    "we identify a candidate for a @xmath0-point at infinite spin anisotropy @xmath1 and show that , as @xmath1 is reduced from infinity , the softening of the potential wells allows formation of a @xmath0-point structure .",
    "we follow the method introduced by fisher and szpilka [ ] and extended by bassler , sasaki , and griffiths [ ] and identify the multiphase structures as comprising interfaces separating domains of the different phases .",
    "the behaviour near a single multiphase point can be analysed in terms of a unique type of interface .",
    "however there are two ( or more ) different phases stable near an @xmath0-point and hence different types of interface must be identified in the analysis .",
    "it is the interactions between the interfaces which are responsible for breaking the multiphase degeneracy and a knowledge of their sign and dependence on separation allows determination of the phase diagram . here",
    "the interface - interface interactions are calculated using an expansion in @xmath2 [ ] .",
    "we consider the classical chiral xy model with 6-fold spin anisotropy , @xmath1 , in the presence of an external magnetic field @xmath3 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is @xmath4 + { d } [ 1 - \\cos ( 6 \\theta_i ) ] /36",
    "\\biggr\\ } \\label{eqn : ham}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the angle between the @xmath6 spin and the magnetic field orientation .",
    "we shall concentrate on the behaviour of the model near the limit @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , defined as @xmath9 , can take only the integer values \\{0,1 ... ,5}.    the ground - state configurations satisfy    @xmath10    for a given @xmath11 , equation ( [ eqn : rec ] ) enables us to express @xmath12 as a function of @xmath5 and @xmath13 .",
    "this fact , together with the observation that @xmath14 , is sufficient to conclude that , for @xmath7 , there will always exist periodic minimal energy configurations",
    ". it will be convenient to label a periodic configuration @xmath15 as @xmath16 .",
    "we can now discuss the phase diagram for @xmath7 , obtained using the floria - griffiths algorithm [ ] , and presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd ] .",
    "we have restricted the labelling of the phases to the first quadrant @xmath17 ; the remaining phases can be constructed through appropriate symmetry operations on the @xmath8 sequences .",
    "the transition lines between regions a and j and regions j and f are first order .",
    "the remaining boundaries are multiphase lines , that is loci where all phases ( including non - periodic ones ) built from arbitrary combinations of the two neighbouring phases are degenerate [ ] .",
    "if the spin anisotropy is reduced from @xmath18 it seems natural to expect the degeneracy along the multiphase lines to be lifted as the spins soften from the clock positions .",
    "although @xmath8 is no longer constrained to assume integer values , nevertheless , for high values of @xmath1 , the angles @xmath5 will be close enough to the clock positions to allow us to continue to use the same labelling scheme .",
    "we are particularly interested in the possible appearance of @xmath0-points for finite @xmath1 .",
    "an @xmath0-point can occur when a first - order transition line separating , say , phases @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( that , for simplicity , we now assume to be non - degenerate ) approaches a commensurate - incommensurate transition .",
    "an infinite number of phases spring out from the multicritical point at the end of the first - order line ( as represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : upsi ] ) . the phases appearing",
    "are made of sequences of @xmath19 and @xmath21 . as @xmath22 the interfaces separating them , which we shall call @xmath23 and @xmath24 are also generally distinct . in the example of fig .",
    "[ fig : upsi ] the general form for a phase in the fan is @xmath25 , where the integers @xmath26 increase approaching the @xmath19 and @xmath21 boundaries respectively .",

    "[ fig : pd ] seems to be a good candidate for becoming an @xmath0-point when @xmath1 is relaxed from @xmath18 .",
    "* p * lies at the end of a first - order transition line and it seems reasonable to consider the two multiphase lines j - g and g - f as special cases of accumulation lines .",
    "therefore we might expect to observe a structure similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : upsi ] for small values of @xmath27 .",
    "consider the j  g boundary ( at a finite distance from the point * p * ) . when @xmath7 the phases @xmath28 and @xmath29 coexist , and it is easy to check that along the boundary all phases built with @xmath30 sequences separated by a @xmath31 block ( i.e. @xmath32 ) are degenerate",
    ". we want to study how this degeneracy is lifted when @xmath1 assumes finite values .",
    "it is physically appealing to regard the @xmath33 block of spins as an interface separating pure @xmath30 sequences .",
    "indeed one can conveniently write the energy per spin of , say , phase @xmath34 as @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) is the energy per spin of phase @xmath39 ( @xmath19 ) , @xmath40 is the creation energy of @xmath33 , @xmath41 is the interaction energy of two interfaces @xmath33 separated by a distance @xmath42 , @xmath43 is the interaction energy of three interfaces and so forth . in the @xmath19 region",
    "the interface tension @xmath40 is positive ; as the phase boundary is approached @xmath40 decreases and eventually , when it is balances the interface interactions , it will be favourable for the system to replace the pure @xmath30 phase with a modulated one .",
    "the nature of the transition depends on the form of the interface interactions , which we now calculate to leading order using an expansion in inverse spin anisotropy .    in the large @xmath1 limit",
    "@xmath44 dominates the energy contribution from the interface interaction terms .",
    "it can be obtained using the reconnection formula [ ] @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the energy of configuration @xmath11 sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : reco ] .    equation ( [ eqn : reco ] ) is exact , but is not convenient for our purposes , as we want only the leading term of @xmath44 .",

    "we may drop the @xmath74 and @xmath75 superscripts on the quantities defined in ( [ eqn : first])-([eqn : last ] ) .",

    "therefore we shall not distinguish between them below .",
    "a knowledge of the leading term in the interface - interface interaction , equation ( [ eqn : v ] ) , allows us to take the first step in determining the ground - state configurations .",
    "because we are considering only two - interface interactions the interfaces must be equispaced in the ground state .",

    "the @xmath82 phase boundaries remain degenerate and higher - order interface interactions can introduce qualitative changes in the phase diagram .",
    "this will be discussed further in section v.",
    "we now focus our attention on what happens along the @xmath20 boundary in the two - interface interaction approximation . in the f region of the phase diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pd ] ) three phases coexist when @xmath7 , namely @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",

    "consider the boundary between one of the phases @xmath89 and region f. along this boundary , in the absence of interactions between the interfaces @xmath90 and @xmath91 , all phases @xmath92 are degenerate .",
    "now we turn on the two - interface interactions . in this approximation ,",

    "we shall hold @xmath48 fixed and assume that @xmath40 can be varied to trace out the phase sequences .",
    "the energy per spin can be written    @xmath96    where @xmath97 and @xmath40 includes the energy tension of the three interfaces @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "simple calculations show that @xmath101    proceeding as in section iii and appendix a the two - wall interactions between interfaces bounding phases @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 are to leading order    @xmath105    we now want to find the values @xmath106 and @xmath107 which minimise ( [ eqn : ebeta ] ) for a given @xmath48 and @xmath40 . by symmetry arguments one has @xmath108 .",
    "it follows from ( [ eqn : pen ] ) that @xmath107 must be bounded from above .",
    "indeed an explicit calculation of the energy @xmath109 shows immediately that @xmath110 or 1 and that the sequence of phases as @xmath40 is lowered is , using the notation @xmath111 $ ] , @xmath112 \\to [ \\bar{n},0,1,0 ] \\to$ ] f.    the boundary between @xmath112 $ ] and @xmath113 $ ] is non - degenerate and can not be split by terms of higher order in @xmath2 .",
