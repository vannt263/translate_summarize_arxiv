    "we adjust the normalizations of rb02 and s06 by a factor @xmath50 , resulting in an @xmath51 increase in luminosity at fixed mass .    the slope of the maxbcg  rass relation , @xmath52 , agrees well with the values found previously .",
    "the rb02 result , @xmath53 , is somewhat shallower , but not significantly so , and the s06 result , @xmath54 , is consistent with the present determination . the normalization of the maxbcg ",
    "rass relation is consistent with the s06 results , with the rb02 masses lying @xmath8 low .",
    "further discussion of these results is in   [ sec : disc ] below .    the maxbcg  rass normalization can be compared with recent lensing results published for small samples of massive clusters at @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite performed weak lensing analyses of 11 and 20 , respectively , individual clusters .",
    "both studies focus on selected high luminosity clusters , with @xmath55 , at redshifts near the median of the maxbcg catalog .",
    "both papers find a correlation between @xmath6 and @xmath56 , but with noisy lensing mass estimates .",
    "as each study employs a different convention for @xmath6 , we have recalculated @xmath6 for these clusters using rass photon data ( see   4.1 in r07 ) . fixing the slope at @xmath57 , we compute the normalization of @xmath58 at @xmath59 , finding @xmath60 and @xmath61 for the @xcite and @xcite clusters , respectively . at this high mass scale ,",
    "the @xcite normalization is consistent with our value , while the @xcite is @xmath62 larger .",
    "a full accounting for this discrepancy is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the good level of agreement displayed in fig .  [ fig : lm ] among three independent approaches to determining the @xmath6@xmath10 relation indicates that optical and x - ray selection methods are finding similar populations of massive halos .",
    "furthermore , the maxbcg  rass result extends to a lower mass scale than is probed by rb02 and s06 . in this section ,",
    "we point out effects that could lead to differences among the three measurements .",
    "the discussion is aimed at raising issues to be addressed by more detailed analysis in future work .",
    "non - zero bias in hydrostatic mass estimates , displayed in early , low - resolution gas simulations @xcite , is a possible source of systematic error that would shift the rb02 result relative to the true relation .",
    "recent studies using mock x - ray exposures of numerical simulations predict a systematic underestimate of binding mass at the level of @xmath63 in @xmath64 @xcite . correcting the rb02 result by this amount",
    "would more closely align it with the maxbcg  rass relation . assuming the latter is an unbiased estimate of the underlying halo relation , the luminosity offset between the two relations measures the malmquist bias arising from the x - ray flux limit of the hiflugcs sample used by rb02 .",
    "good agreement would signal a small bias , meaning small intrinsic scatter ( @xmath65 ) between luminosity and mass .",
    "such small scatter is considered unlikely by the analysis of s06 .    a separate argument",
    "can be made based on slope estimates .",
    "if hydrostatic mass estimates scale with true mass as @xmath66 , then one would expect the rb02 slope to differ by @xmath67 from the maxbcg",
    " rass value",
    ". the measured slope difference , @xmath68 , implies @xmath69 .",
    "strongly mass dependent hydrostatic biases are therefore ruled out .",
    "one could shift the rb02 result to higher masses without requiring a major reduction in scatter , @xmath70 , as constrained in s06 .",
    "this would require shifting the s06 result by modifying the assumed cosmology .",
    "the luminosity normalization is sensitive to power spectrum normalization , @xmath71 , so raising @xmath30 to @xmath72 would shift the s06 result to lower @xmath6 and preserve the current level of malmquist - bias for the rb02 result .",
    "however , this adjustment would offset the s06 and maxbcg  rass relations at the @xmath73 level .",
    "since it is binned by richness , the maxbcg  rass result is sensitive to covariance among @xmath6 and @xmath0 at fixed @xmath56",
    ". simulations suggest mild anti - correlation , as at fixed mass high concentration halos have higher @xmath6 but fewer galaxies  @xcite . as an illustration of the effect of covariance , consider the case of a bivariate , log - normal distribution for @xmath6 and @xmath0 with constant covariance .",
    "the off - diagonal term can be characterized by the correlation coefficient , @xmath74 , where @xmath75 are the normalized deviations from the mean relation .",
    "consider a mass function that is a local power - law , @xmath76 , where @xmath77 .",
    "convolving this function with the bivariate log - normal , and using bayes theorem , allows one to write the conditional likelihood @xmath78 , where @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the result is a bivariate gaussian with mean mass @xmath81 , with @xmath82 the inverse of the input mean richness  mass relation and @xmath83 the scatter in mass at fixed richness .",
    "the x - ray luminosity at fixed optical richness is distributed in a log - normal manner with mean @xmath84 and variance @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the slope of the halo @xmath87 relation .",
    "when @xmath6 and @xmath0 are independent ( @xmath88 ) , the mean luminosity reflects that of the mean mass selected by the richness cut . when @xmath89 , the mean is shifted by an amount that scales linearly with the mass function slope @xmath90 . if the scatter is constant , then this shift affects all @xmath0-binned points equally , and the slope of the richness - binned @xmath6-@xmath56 relation will be unbiased , @xmath91 .",
    "however , in cold dark matter models , the slope @xmath90 runs with mass , and this running can induce a change in slope at the level @xmath92 .    the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : lm ] explicitly demonstrates this effect for the case @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 . we use a discrete set of halos from the hubble volume simulation @xcite",
    "that define a mass function which is not a power - law @xcite . to each halo",
    ", we assign richness and luminosity using a constant log - normal covariance , then bin the sample on optical richness and compute mean luminosities and masses for each bin . imposing a correlation coefficient @xmath96 tilts the richness - binned @xmath6@xmath56 slope by @xmath97 , or roughly @xmath98 given the error in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lmresult ] ) .    as discussed in @xcite , covariance can both tilt the scaling relation and modify the scatter .",
    "the second observable quantity affected by @xmath99 is the variance in @xmath6 at fixed richness @xmath0 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : lvar ] ) .",
    "this scatter was constrained in r07 to be @xmath100 . in our model , it takes on values of @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 for @xmath104 , 0 , and @xmath105 , respectively .",
    "we stress that these values are sensitive to the assumed degree of mass scatter at fixed @xmath0 .",
    "our assumed value of @xmath106 is smaller than that inferred by the spread in galaxy velocity dispersions at fixed richness  @xcite and employed by @xcite in the lensing analysis .",

    "if the r07 measurement of @xmath109 is correct , then either the @xcite scatter is an overestimate or the simple log - normal model employed here is insufficient .",
    "improved understanding of the variance is clearly desired .",
    "constraints on @xmath110 can be obtained by individual x - ray follow - up observations of richness - selected maxbcg subsamples .",
    "such data can also generate hydrostatic mass estimates , enabling constraints on the mass scatter @xmath83 .",
    "such a study would begin to test all the elements of the full covariance @xmath111 used to describe the underlying massive halo population .",
    "in this letter , we present a new measurement of the scaling between x - ray luminosity and mass using @xmath112 optically - selected clusters of galaxies .",
    "x - ray luminosities are derived from rass photon maps , while masses are determined independently through modeling of the mean cluster lensing profiles . binning clusters by optical richness , we find that the mean @xmath6 and @xmath56 values follow a power - law relation with slope @xmath52 .",
    "the consistency in slope with previous studies , including those based on hydrostatic mass estimates , confirms that the optically - selected maxbcg catalog selects a population of massive halos similar to those of x - ray samples .",
    "the consistency implies that systematic errors in hydrostatic mass are not strongly scale - dependent .",
