    "the extension of the quantum teleportation protocol from discrete ( finite dimensional hilbert spaces ) @xcite to continuous variable ( cv ) ( infinite dimension ) systems was a landmark to cv quantum communication @xcite .",
    "the main goal of teleportation is to make sure that at the end of the whole protocol a quantum state originally describing alice s system turns out to describe a quantum system with bob at a different location .",
    "moreover , no direct transmission of the system from alice to bob is done and the knowledge of alice s system is not needed at all to accomplish such a task .",
    "these two properties clearly illustrate why teleportation is so powerful a tool . indeed , for quantum teleportation take place alice and bob only need to be able to act locally on their systems , communicate classically and share a quantum channel ( entangled state ) . at the end of the process alice s system",
    "is no longer described by its original state that now describes bob s system .    in principle",
    ", a perfect teleportation only occurs when alice and bob share a maximally entangled state . by perfect teleportation",
    "we mean that at the end of the protocol and with probability one bob s system will be exactly described by the state that originally described alice s system . for discrete systems , and in particular for qubits , such maximally entangled states ( bell states ) that alice and bob must share can be experimentally generated in the laboratory @xcite . for cv - systems , however , the perfect implementation of the teleportation protocol @xcite requires a maximally entangled state ( the einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) state ) that can not be generated in the laboratory @xcite . in modern quantum optics terminology , one needs an entangled two - mode squeezed state with infinite squeezing ( @xmath2 ) . for finite",
    "squeezing ( @xmath3 ) , the teleported quantum state at bob s is never identical to the original one at alice s .",
    "another assumption in the usual teleportation protocols is related to the pool of input states available to alice , i.e. , the states that alice might choose to teleport to bob .",
    "for example , consider the simplest discrete system , a qubit . in this case",
    "it is assumed that alice s input is given by @xmath4 , with @xmath5 and @xmath6 random complex numbers satisfying the normalization condition @xmath7 . for cv systems , and",
    "in particular for coherent states @xmath0 , with @xmath8 complex , it is often assumed that alice s pool of states cover the entire complex plane @xcite . from a theoretical point of view , either for a qubit or a coherent state , these assumptions are the proper ones in order to determine the strictest conditions guaranteeing a `` truly '' quantum teleportation , i.e. , the conditions where no purely classical protocol can achieve the same efficiency as those predicted by the quantum ones @xcite . from a practical point of view , however , these assumptions are only valid for qubits , being unrealistic for cv systems .",
    "indeed , the energy of a coherent state is proportional to @xmath9 and in order to cover the entire complex plane we would need states with infinite energy .",
    "also , the greater @xmath10 the less quantum a coherent state becomes @xcite and other techniques than quantum teleportation such as a direct transmission of the state may be better suited in this case .    with these two realistic assumptions in mind , a natural question then arises .",
    "is it possible to further improve the efficiency of the standard cv teleportation protocol ( cvtp ) by taking into account in any modification of the original setup @xcite these two facts ?    for a pool of input coherent states with alice described by a gaussian distribution centered at the vacuum state @xcite and when alice is always teleporting a fixed single state @xcite , the answer to the previous question is affirmative . in standard modifications of the cvtp @xcite , only a single parameter",
    "is freely adjusted in order to improve the quality of the teleported state : bob is free to choose the gain @xmath11 that he might apply equally to the quadratures of his mode at the end of the protocol ( see figure [ fig ] ) . in the original setup @xmath12 , while in the modified versions it was tuned as a function of the input states and of the squeezing of the channel in order to increase the efficiency of cvtp .",
    "an identical strategy was employed to improve the efficiency of cv entanglement swapping @xcite , where the optimal @xmath11 was tuned for a specific input state .    what would happen if we go beyond a gaussian probability distribution centered at the vacuum and use instead uniform distributions or distributions centered in the coherent state @xmath13 , @xmath14 ? more important , what are the optimal conditions if we introduce _ more than one free parameter _ in the modified version of cvtp @xcite , where either alice or bob can change the protocol ?",
    "our goal here is to investigate these two questions in detail and without assuming we know the state to be teleported @xcite .",
    "the only knowledge we have is the probability of alice picking a particular coherent state @xmath0 according to a predefined probability distribution . in other words ,",
    "alice and bob know a priori the probability distribution describing the possible set of states to be teleported , but not the actual state at a given execution of the protocol .    in what follows we show that it is possible to achieve further significant increase in performance with extra free parameters that introduce , however , minimal changes to the original scheme , modifications of which can already be implemented in the laboratory . also , some of the optimal settings are counterintuitive and not found in standard modifications of cvtp .",
    "for instance , sometimes it is better to use an _ unbalanced _ beam splitter ( bs ) instead of a balanced one when alice combines her share of the entangled channel with the state to be teleported .",
    "we also investigate several probability distributions describing the input states and we show the optimal modifications to each one of them .",
    "moreover , the optimal parameters change appreciably if we work with either uniform or gaussian distribution or if those distributions are centered or not on the vacuum state . and",
    "as expected , the changes in the original cvtp not only depend on the specific probability distribution associated to alice s input states but also on the entanglement of the channel .",
    "before diving into the mathematical details of our calculations , it is worth presenting the bigger picture , i.e. , the choices we made from the start in order to modify the original setup and the strategy employed to determine the optimal teleportation protocol .    in the original proposal ( see figure  [ fig ] ) , a two - mode squeezed state with squeezing @xmath15 , our entanglement resource , is shared between alice and bob .",
    "mode @xmath16 goes to alice and mode @xmath17 to bob .",
    "the state with alice to be teleported is represented by mode @xmath18 , which can be any coherent state @xmath0 . to proceed with the teleportation",
    ", alice combines modes @xmath18 and @xmath16 in a @xmath19 bs and afterwards measures the position and momentum ( quadratures of the electromagnetic field ) of modes @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively , whose results @xmath22 and @xmath23 are then classically communicated to bob . with this information he displaces in position ( @xmath24 ) and momentum ( @xmath25 ) his mode to get the right teleported state . the displacements and gain @xmath26 are chosen and fixed as the ones yielding perfect teleportation when @xmath2 ( maximal entanglement ) .     in the original proposal",
    "@xcite we have @xmath27 ( @xmath28 bs ) , @xmath29 , with @xmath12 , and position and momentum displacements given by @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "these choices yield an average fidelity @xmath32 independent of whatever pool of states ( labeled by @xmath33 ) is available to alice . here , for fixed @xmath33 and squeezing @xmath15 , the optimization to get the optimal @xmath32 is implemented over three free parameters , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , leading to @xmath32 that depends both on @xmath15 and @xmath33 .",
    "see text for details.,width=302 ]    a priory there is no guarantee that the previous choices for the bs transmittance ( @xmath36 ) , displacements and gain are the optimal ones for all combinations of finite squeezing @xmath15 and probability distribution for the pool of states available to alice .",
    "therefore , in order to search for the optimal protocol for a given squeezing @xmath15 and probability distribution we allow the bs to have an arbitrary transmittance ( @xmath37 ) , with @xmath38 ( see figure  [ fig ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the quadratures displacements and gain @xmath11 that bob must implement after alice informs him of her measurement results ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) @xcite are also independently chosen in order to optimize the protocol .",
    "formally , bob s displacements are given by @xmath30 and @xmath31 , with @xmath35 and @xmath39 chosen in order to optimize the efficiency of cvtp .        in what follows we present the details of the mathematical analysis of the modified cvtp , where the three parameters described above are incorporated into the protocol .",
    "we use interchangeably the words kets , states , and modes to refer to the same object , namely , the quantized electromagnetic modes @xcite . also , when we refer to position @xmath40 and momentum @xmath41 , with @xmath42 and @xmath43 annihilation and creation operators , we mean the quadratures of mode @xmath44 , with commutation relation @xmath45=i/2 $ ] .",
    "an arbitrary input state with alice can be written in the position basis as @xmath46 where @xmath47 and the integration runs over the entire real line .",
    "the entangled state shared between alice and bob can also be written in the position basis as @xmath48 with @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "unless stated otherwise , we keep the ordering of the kets fixed , i.e , the notation @xmath51 means that the first two modes / kets are with alice and the third one with bob . using equations  ( [ input ] ) and ( [ canal ] )",
    "we can write the initial state describing all modes before the beginning of the teleportation protocol as @xmath52 , or more explicitly , @xmath53    the first step in the protocol consists in sending mode 1 ( input state ) and mode 2 ( alice s share of the two - mode squeezed state ) to a bs with transmittance @xmath54 ( see figure [ fig ] ) .",
    "calling @xmath55 the operator representing the action of the bs we have in the position basis @xcite @xmath56    inserting equation  ( [ bs ] ) into ( [ initial ] ) and making the following variable changes , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , we have @xmath59 for the total state after modes @xmath18 and @xmath16 go through @xmath37 .",
    "the next step of the protocol consists in measuring the momentum and position of modes @xmath21 and @xmath20 , respectively . for the quantized electromagnetic mode ,",
    "this is achieved by homodyne detectors yielding classical photocurrents that assign real numbers for the quadratures @xmath60 and @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "since alice will project mode @xmath21 onto the momentum basis , it is convenient to rewrite equation  ( [ initial2 ] ) using the fourier transformation relating the position and momentum eigenstates , @xmath62    thus , inserting equation  ( [ fourier1 ] ) into ( [ initial2 ] ) we have @xmath63    in the second step of the protocol , alice measures the momentum of mode @xmath21 and the position of mode @xmath20 ( see figure [ fig ] ) . assuming her measurement results are @xmath23 and @xmath22 , the total state at the end of the measurement is simply obtained applying the measurement postulate of quantum mechanics , @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the identity operator acting on mode @xmath17 . also , @xmath66 is the probability of measuring momentum @xmath23 and position @xmath22 , with @xmath67 denoting the total trace .",
    "specifying to the position basis and noting that @xmath68 and @xmath69 we have @xmath70 where bob s state is @xmath71 here @xmath72 and @xmath73 where equation  ( [ psilinha ] ) was obtained using ( [ initial2b ] ) .",
    "the third step of the protocol consists in alice sending to bob via a classical channel ( photocurrents ) her measurement results . with this information bob",
    "is able to implement the fourth and last step of the protocol , namely , he displaces his mode quadratures according to the following rule , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "mathematically , this corresponds to the application of the displacement operator @xmath74\\hat{p}+2iim[\\alpha]\\hat{x}}$ ] , with @xmath75 .",
    "since @xmath76 and @xmath77 commute with their commutator we can apply glauber s formula to obtain @xmath78im[\\alpha]}e^{-2ire[\\alpha]\\hat{p}}e^{2iim[\\alpha]\\hat{x}}$ ] .",
    "this leads to @xmath79    the final state with bob , @xmath80 , can be put as follows if we use equation  ( [ disp ] ) and make the variable change @xmath81 , @xmath82 note that @xmath83 in bob s final state is an irrelevant global phase and could be suppressed .",
    "it is worth mentioning at this point that equation  ( [ bobfinal ] ) , together with equations  ( [ prob ] ) and ( [ psilinha ] ) , are quite general .",
    "they allow us to get the teleported state with bob for any input state and any entangled state ( channel ) shared between alice and bob . for instance , if we use a maximally entangled state ( epr state ) we have @xcite @xmath84 in equation  ( [ canal ] ) . using this channel in equation  ( [ bobfinal ] )",
    "leads to @xmath85 if we set @xmath86 and @xmath27 , i.e , we have a perfect teleportation .      as a figure of merit to decide the optimality of the protocol we employ the average fidelity @xmath32 @xcite , whose computation requires the specification of the presumed probability of available states with alice , assumed fixed throughout the many runs of the protocol .",
    "the fidelity measures how close the output state with bob at the end of the protocol is to the input state employed by alice . here",
    "the average is taken over the fidelities of each input state and its respective output , with the weight of each state given by its probability to be picked out of the states available to alice .",
    "our strategy consists , therefore , in choosing @xmath34 , and @xmath35 in order to maximize @xmath32 .",
    "mathematically , if the density matrix describing the output state with bob after one single run of the protocol is @xmath87 , the fidelity is defined as @xmath88 where we highlight that the fidelity depends on the input state @xmath89 and on the measurement outcomes obtained by alice . for the moment we leave implicit the dependence on the other parameters , i.e , what channel / entanglement we have and @xmath90 , @xmath39 , and @xmath35 .",
    "note that @xmath91 achieves its maximal value ( one ) only if we have a flawless teleportation ( @xmath92 ) and its minimal one ( zero ) if the output is orthogonal to the input .    at each run of the protocol , alice will measure @xmath23 and @xmath22 with probability @xmath93",
    "hence , bob s final ensemble of states , averaged over all possible measurement results for a fixed input state @xmath89 , is @xmath94    furthermore , to properly search the optimal configuration for a probability distribution of input states @xmath95 with alice , another averaging is needed , this time over the pool of states available to her @xcite , @xmath96    the strategy to optimize the teleportation protocol , once we know @xmath95 , is the search for the triple of points @xmath97 maximizing @xmath98 .",
    "therefore , for fixed entanglement , we either solve analytically ( if possible ) or numerically the following three equations for @xmath99 and @xmath35 , @xmath100 the obtained solutions are then inserted into ( [ fid3 ] ) and slightly varied about their actual values in order to be sure we have a global maximum , ruling out possible local maximums , minimums , and saddle points .",
    "in the rest of this paper we particularize to input states at alice s given by coherent states , @xmath101 with @xmath8 complex , and to the entanglement shared between alice and bob given by two - mode squeezed vacuum states , @xmath102 where @xmath103 are fock number states at alice s ( bob s ) . also , @xmath15 is the squeezing parameter and for @xmath104 we have @xmath105 , the vacuum state , and for @xmath106 the unphysical maximally entangled epr state .",
    "both coherent and two - mode squeezed states of the quantized electromagnetic field are easily generated in the laboratory today and they were the ingredients employed in the experimental implementation of the original cvtp @xcite .",

    ", we showed that considerable gains in efficiency are achieved for all distributions if we introduce two slight modifications in the original setup .",
    "the first modification was the use of a beam splitter whose transmittance could be changed at our will .",
    "this beam splitter was employed to mix the state to be teleported with alice s share of the entangled resource , instead of the usual balanced beam splitter .",
    "the other modification was the possibility to freely choose the displacements in the quadratures , i.e. , in position and momentum , of the output ( teleported ) state with bob . by allowing these three actions to be independently adjusted once the entanglement of the channel and the pool of input states",
    "are known , we were able to achieve considerable gains in efficiency when compared to that predicted by the original protocol .",
    "we have also compared the three - parameter optimization strategy against the usual one - parameter strategy , where the position and momentum gains are not independently chosen @xcite . for certain types of distributions for the pool of input states with alice , namely , those centered at the vacuum state and with circular symmetry , we have shown that the three - parameter strategy reduces to the one - parameter case . however ,",
    "when the circular symmetry is broken , the three - parameter strategy is crucial in order to get a more efficient teleportation protocol .",
    "indeed , we have shown that for circular symmetry broken distributions , the one - parameter strategy does not give significant gains in efficiency when compared to the original teleportation protocol while the three - parameter strategy gives considerable gains .",
    "in addition to important gains in efficiency with the three - parameter strategy , we were also able to identify an interesting feature for distributions off - centered from the origin of the complex plane but with the circular symmetry point lying on either the real or imaginary axis .",
    "we have shown that these distributions achieve the highest gain in performance when compared to the equivalent distributions with symmetry points centered away from the real and imaginary axis .",
    "also , for distributions with circular symmetry points lying on the real and imaginary axis , we have shown that as we increase the distance of the circular symmetry point from the origin , the optimal efficiency tends to a limiting value that is greater than the efficiency of the original teleportation protocol .",
    "this effect is more expressive for channels with a low degree of entanglement and is absent for distributions with the symmetry point not belonging to the real and imaginary axis .",
    "we believe these interesting properties might be useful in the implementation of continuous variable quantum key distribution schemes based on coherent states @xcite , where instead of transmitting the coherent state between the parties involved in the key distribution scheme , with the transmission process adding noise and degrading the signal , one teleports it using the optimal strategy here presented .",
    "furthermore , the calculations we made assumed a two - mode vacuum squeezed state as our entanglement resource and a pool of input states given by coherent states .",
    "these choices were dictated by the fact that the usual resources employed in actual implementations of continuous variable teleportation are described by these states @xcite .",
    "however , the formalism presented in sec . [ secformalism ] is quite general and can be easily adapted to any input state and any type of quantum channel .",
    "these changes are mathematically implemented by simply substituting the input and entangled states expansion coefficients in the position basis , equations  ( [ input ] ) , ( [ canal ] ) , ( [ in ] ) , and ( [ ch ] ) , with the corresponding ones for the new states .    finally , we would like to point out to a particular extension of the research here presented that might prove fruitful .",
    "it is an extensive analysis of the three parameter optimization strategy for several pool of input states assuming that alice and bob share quantum channels given by _ mixed _ states . since decoherence , noise , and attenuation drive pure entangled states to mixed ones after a sufficient exposure time",
    ", it would be interesting to investigate whether the same techniques here presented can be helpful in improving the efficiency of a continuous variable teleportation protocol that employs non pure channels .",
