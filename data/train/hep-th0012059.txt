    "recent development in the superstring theory @xcite suggests that the low - energy dynamics of a @xmath2-brane moving in a flat d - dimensional spacetime @xmath3 is governed by the dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) action @xmath4 where @xmath5 is an induced metric on the brane and @xmath6 is a @xmath1 gauge field strength . using the gauge freedom under diffeomorphisms of the world - volume",
    ", one can choose coordinates @xmath7 , where @xmath8 are transverse to the brane , and rewrite the action as @xmath9    a trivial solution to this action is @xmath10 , what means that the @xmath11-brane is flat and there is no electromagnetic field . because of the symmetry @xmath12 , the planar solution remains true when @xmath6 does not vanish , in which case the electromagnetic field is governed by the born - infeld ( bi ) action .",
    "moreover , as was noticed by gibbons @xcite , the only regular static source - free solution of the bi electrodynamics which falls off at spatial infinity is a trivial one .",
    "this is no longer true in the case of @xmath13 coincident @xmath2-branes whose low - energy dynamics is described by the non - abelian generalization of the dbi action involving the @xmath14 yang - mills ( ym ) field .",
    "namely , for flat @xmath15-branes the regular sourceless finite energy configurations of the ym field were found to exist @xcite .",
    "the topological reason for this lies in the vacuum periodicity of the @xmath0 gauge field in four dimensions .",
    "neighboring ym vacua are separated by potential barriers which in the case of the bi action are lowered down to a finite height due to the breaking of the scale invariance in the bi theory .",
    "this removes the well - known obstruction for classical glueballs @xcite , which can be summarized as follows .",
    "scale invariance of the usual quadratic yang - mills action implies that the ym field stress  energy tensor is traceless : @xmath16 , where @xmath17 .",
    "since the energy density is positive , @xmath18 , the sum of the principal pressures @xmath19 is also everywhere positive , _",
    "i.e. _ the yang ",
    "mills matter is repulsive .",
    "consequently , mechanical equilibrium within the localized static ym field configuration is impossible @xcite . in the spontaneously broken gauge theories scale invariance",
    "is broken by scalar fields , what opens the possibility of particle - like solutions : magnetic monopoles ( in the theory with the real triplet higgs ) and sphalerons ( in the theory with the complex doublet higgs ) .",
    "the role of the higgs field in these two cases is somewhat different . for monopoles",
    "the topological significance of the higgs field is essential : indeed , monopoles interpolate between the unbroken and broken higgs phases . in the case of sphalerons ,",
    "the higgs field plays mostly a role of an attractive agent which is able to glue the repulsive ym matter .",
    "historically , topological significance of the dashen - hasslacher - neveu ( dhn ) solution in the @xmath0 theory with the doublet higgs  @xcite was first explained by manton @xcite as a consequence of non  triviality of the _ third _ homotopy group of the higgs broken phase manifold @xmath20 .",
    "this is equivalent to existence of non - contractible loops in the space of field configurations passing through the vacuum .",
    "then by the minimax argument one finds that a saddle point exists on the energy surface which is a proper place for the sphaleron .",
    "later it became clear that similar solutions arise in some models without higgs , such as einstein - yang - mills @xcite or yang - mills with dilaton @xcite ( for a review and further references see  @xcite ) .",
    "the main common feature of these theories is that the conformal invariance of the classical ym equations is broken , what removes the `` mechanical '' obstruction for existence of particle - like configurations .",
    "as far as the topological argument is concerned , it is worth noting that @xmath21 for the dhn solution , so the same third homotopy group argument applies to the gauge group @xmath22 itself , that is , it works equally in the theories without higgs .",
    "breaking of the scale invariance in the nbi theory also gives rise to sphaleron glueballs which mediate transitions between different topological sectors of the theory .",
    "their mass is related to the bi field - strength parameter which for the d - branes is @xmath23 .",
    "we will discuss here glueball solutions in two versions of the nbi theory : with the ordinary and symmetrized trace .",
    "we also show that , when the triplet higgs field is added , the theory admits , apart from the usual magnetic monopoles , the hybrid solutions which can be interpreted as sphaleron excitations of monopoles . at the end",
    "we briefly discuss monopole solutions in gauge theories on non - commutative spaces and give an explicit solution for the @xmath1 monopole with higgs in the d - brane picture with the kalb - ramond field .",
    "a precise definition of the nbi action was actively discussed during past few years @xcite , for an earlier discussion see @xcite . an ambiguity is encoded in specifying the trace operation over the gauge group generators .",
    "formally a number of possibilities can be envisaged . starting with the determinant form of the @xmath1 dirac - born - infeld action @xmath24 one can use the usual trace , the symmetrized or antisymmetrized @xcite ones , or evaluate the determinant both with respect to lorentz and the gauge matrix indices @xcite .",
    "alternatively one can start with the square root form , which is most easily derived from ( [ gal - det ] ) using the identities @xmath25 ^{1/4}&,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 ( similarly for @xmath27 ) , and @xmath28    this gives the relation @xmath29 with @xmath30 .    for a non - abelian gauge group the relations ( [ gal - id ] ) are no longer valid ,",
    "so there is no direct connection between the determinant and the square root form of the lagrangian .",
    "therefore the latter can be chosen as an independent starting point for a non - abelian generalization .",
    "there is , however , a particular trace operation  symmetrized trace  under which generators commute , so both forms of the lagrangian remain equivalent .",
    "this definition is favored by the no - derivative argument , as was clarified by tseytlin @xcite . restricting the validity of the non - abelian effective action by the constant field approximation",
    ", one has to drop commutators of the matrix - valued @xmath6 since these can be reexpressed through the derivatives of @xmath6 .",
    "this corresponds to the following definition @xmath31 where symmetrization applies to the field strength ( not to potentials ) .",
    "this action reproduces an exact string theory result for non - abelian fields up to @xmath32 order .",
    "although there is no reason to believe that this will be true in higher orders in @xmath33 , the @xmath34 action is an interesting model providing minimal generalization of the abelian action @xcite .",
    "an explicit form of the su(2 ) nbi action with the symmetrized trace for static @xmath35-symmetric magnetic type configurations was found only recently @xcite .",
    "one starts with the definition @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 of the dimension of length@xmath39 is the bi critical field. the normalization of the gauge group generators is unusual and is chosen as follows @xmath40 the symmetrized trace of the product of @xmath11 matrices is defined as @xmath41 and it is understood that the general matrix function like ( [ gal - lnbi ] ) has to be series expanded .",
    "it has to be noted that under the @xmath42 operation the generators can be treated as commuting objects , and the gauge algebra should not be applied , ( e.g. the square of the pauli matrix @xmath43 ) until the symmetrization in the series expansion is completed .",
    "a general @xmath35 symmetric @xmath0 gauge field is described by the witten s ansatz @xmath44 where the functions @xmath45 depend on @xmath46 and @xmath47 is introduced to maintain the standard normalization .",
    "here we use a rotating basis @xmath48 for the @xmath0 generators defined as @xmath49 where @xmath50 , with @xmath51 being the pauli matrices .",
    "these generators obey the commutation relations @xmath52=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\epsilon_{ijk}t_k$ ] .    from four functions entering this ansatz",
    "one can be gauged away . in the static case",
    "we can further reduce the number of independent functions to two , while the static purely magnetic configurations are fully described by a single function @xmath53 : @xmath54    the field strength tensor has the following non - zero components @xmath55 where prime denotes derivatives with respect to @xmath56 .",
    "for purely magnetic configurations the second term under the square root is zero , and the substitution of ( [ gal - fcompts ] ) gives @xmath57 to find an explicit expression for the lagrangian one has to expand the square root in a triple series in terms of the even powers of generators @xmath58 , then to calculate the symmetrized trace of the powers of generators in all orders , and finally to make a resummation of the series .",
    "the result reads @xmath59 where @xmath60 here we assumed that @xmath61 , otherwise an @xmath62 form is more appropriate .",
    "note that when the difference @xmath63 changes sign , the k function @xmath64 remains real valued .",
    "it can be checked that when @xmath65 , the standard yang - mills lagrangian ( restricted to monopole ansatz ) is recovered . in the strong field region",
    "our expression differs essentially from the square root / ordinary trace lagrangian .",
    "the corresponding explicit action defined in a square root form with an ordinary trace reads : @xmath66",
    "as is well - known , vacuum in the @xmath0 ym theory in the four - dimensional spacetime splits into an infinite number of disjoint classes which can not be deformed into each other by small ( contractible to a point ) gauge transformations . writing the pure gauge vacuum ym potentials as @xmath67 , where @xmath68 and imposing an asymptotic condition @xmath69 we can interpret @xmath70 as mappings @xmath71 .",
    "all sets of such @xmath72 s falls into the sequence of homotopy classes characterized by the winding number @xmath73=\\frac{1}{24\\pi^2}\\ensuremath{\\mathop{\\rm tr}\\nolimits }    \\int\\limits_{r_3}\\;\\mathrm{u}d\\mathrm{u}^{-1}\\wedge    \\mathrm{u}d\\mathrm{u}^{-1}\\wedge    \\mathrm{u}d\\mathrm{u}^{-1}.\\ ] ]    a representative of the @xmath74-th class can be chosen as @xmath75 the corresponding potential will be given by the witten ansatz with @xmath76 .",
    "the asymptotic condition ( [ gal - uinfty ] ) leads to the following fall - off requirements .",
    "@xmath77    the representatives of different vacuum classes with different @xmath74 can not be continuously deformed into each other within the class of the purely vacuum fields .",
    "but there exists an interpolating sequence of nonvacuum field configurations of finite energy ( the latter can be defined on shell and then continued off - shell ) satisfying the required boundary conditions ( [ gal - ainfty ] ) that connects different vacuum classes .",
    "finite energy solutions for the actions ( [ gal - str ] ) or ( [ gal - otr ] ) should satisfy the following boundary conditions near the origin @xmath78 and at the infinity @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are free parameters . (",
    "the value @xmath82 together with finiteness of the energy implies that @xmath83 . )",
    "the leading terms are the same as required for the vacuum configurations . these solutions ,",
    "if exists , can be shown to lie on the path in the solution space connecting two topologically distinct vacua .",
    "consider a one - parameter sequence of field configurations ( off shell generally ) depending on a continuous parameter @xmath84 $ ] @xcite @xmath85=i\\frac{1-w}{2}\\mathrm{u}_+d\\mathrm{u}_+^{-1}+ i\\frac{1+w}{2}\\mathrm{u}_-d\\mathrm{u}_-^{-1 } , \\label{gal - aseq}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 this field vanishes for @xmath87 , whereas for @xmath88 it can be represented as @xmath89=i{\\rm u}d{\\rm u}^{-1},\\ \\ \\ { \\rm with}\\ \\ \\ { \\rm u}=\\exp\\{i\\pi(w-1)t_1/\\sqrt{2}\\}.\\ ] ] in view of the above boundary condition for @xmath90 , in the case @xmath91 one has the @xmath92 vacuum .",
    "now , the crucial thing is that for @xmath93 we come back to the configuration ( [ gal - acompts ] ) .",
    "so if the solution to the classical field equations with the required asymptotics exists indeed , this can be interpreted as a manifestation of the finiteness of the potential barrier between distinct vacua .",
    "note that the same reasoning holds for the ordinary yang  mills system .",
    "but due to the scale invariance of this theory there is no function @xmath90 which minimizes the energy functional .",
    "both the analysis of the equations following from nbi lagrangians ( [ gal - str],[gal - otr ] ) using the methods of dynamical systems @xcite and numerical experiments @xcite shows that such solutions exist in both nbi models  with ordinary and symmetrized trace .",
    "they form a discrete sequence labeled by the number of nodes of the function @xmath53 , and the lower one - node solution is similar to the sphaleron of the weinberg - salam theory .    in the nbi theory",
    "@xmath38 is the only dimensionful parameter giving a natural scale of length , i.e. theories with different values of @xmath38 are equivalent up to rescaling . setting @xmath94 we obtain the equations of motion for the symmetrized trace nbi model @xmath95    for the ordinary trace model one has @xmath96    we are looking for the solutions satisfying the boundary conditions ( [ gal - zero],[gal - infty ] ) . for large @xmath56",
    "both equations reduce to that of the usual ym theory , so the solutions are not much different in the far zone . near the origin",
    "the equations are different , more careful analysis reveals that the nature of stationary points associated with the origin is different for two versions of the theory .    a trivial solution to these equations ( valid for both models ) is an embedded abelian monopole @xmath97 .",
    "in the bi theory it has the finite energy . from the general analysis ,",
    "as discussed in @xcite for the ordinary trace , one finds that @xmath90 can not have local minima for @xmath98 and can not have local maxima for @xmath99 .",
    "the same remains true for the symmetrized trace .",
    "thus any solution which starts at the origin on the interval @xmath100 must remain within the strip @xmath100 .",
    "once @xmath90 leaves the strip , it diverges in a finite distance .",
    "regular solutions exist for a discrete sequence of @xmath80 shown in the table [ gal - tab : param ] together with corresponding masses @xmath101 for the first six @xmath102 which is the number of zeroes of @xmath53 .",

    "numerical solutions for both models are shown in the figure [ gal - fig : sphalsols ] .",
    "it is surprising that the solutions with the ordinary and the symmetrized trace are rather similar in spite of the substantial difference of the lagrangians .",
    "they have however somewhat different behavior near the origin : those with the symmetrized trace leave the vacuum value @xmath104 faster and stay longer in the intermediate region where @xmath53 is close to zero . in this region",
    "the magnetic charge is almost unscreened , so this is the particle core .",
    "thus for all @xmath102 solutions are more compact in the ordinary trace case . for both models the parameters @xmath105 grow infinitely with increasing node number @xmath102 .",
    "this means that there is no limiting solution as @xmath106 contrary to the eym case where such solutions do exist .",

    "magnetic monopoles are associated with the deformed d3-branes with non zero transverse coordinates @xmath8 interpreted as higgs scalars .",
    "the deformation can be thought of as caused by an open string attached to the brane . in the bps limit",
    "the solutions are the same as for the quadratic ym theory @xcite monopoles for the ordinary trace model were constructed by grandi , moreno and schaposnik @xcite . for monopoles",

    "the ym ansatz remains the same , while for the higgs field @xmath112    for simplicity we consider here the square root form of the nbi action ( [ gal - otr ] ) .",
    "performing an integration over spherical angles one obtains the energy functional ( equal to minus action for static configurations ) @xmath113 where @xmath114    varying this functional one finds the equations of motion @xmath115    boundary conditions at infinity for a solution with a unit magnetic charge read @xmath116 while at the origin @xmath117    starting with ( [ gal - orgbound ] ) one can construct the following power series solution converging in a non - zero domain around the origin : @xmath118 where @xmath80 and @xmath119 are free parameters .",
    "for @xmath65 the theory reduces to the standard ymh - theory , admitting monopoles . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that monopole solutions to the eqs.([gal - eqf ] , [ gal - eqh ] ) continue to exist up to some limiting value @xmath120 .",
    "now we have to explain why one can expect to have also the hybrid solutions .",
    "near the origin the higgs field is close to zero , so the influence of the term @xmath121 is negligible , and the ym field behaves like in the pure nbi case . as was argued in @xcite , nbi theories with different @xmath38",
    "are equivalent up to rescaling , and so for @xmath38 large enough the solution starts forming just near the origin .",
    "but for larger @xmath56 the role of higgs is increased , so one can expect that some solutions can be trapped to the monopole asymptotic regime .",
    "more precisely , in the region of @xmath122 , the function @xmath123 is similar to the sphaleron solution of @xcite : starting with @xmath124 it passes through @xmath125 and then tends to the value @xmath124 . after leaving this region",
    "the solution enters the region where it has properties of the nbi monopole and at @xmath126 both field functions tend to their asymptotical values ( [ gal - boundinf ] ) .",
    "the higgs field @xmath127 for these hybrid solutions behaves qualitatively in the same way as for the monopoles .    to obtain hybrid solutions",

    "1,2 together with the ground state monopole ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "the masses increase with @xmath102 and converge rapidly to the mass of an embedded abelian solution with frozen higgs : @xmath133    although this singular solution does not satisfy the boundary conditions ( [ gal - orgbound ] ) it has finite energy within the nbi - higgs theory , which can be obtained by substituting the eq .",
    "( [ gal - absol ] ) into the eq .",
    "( [ gal - energy ] ) : @xmath134    with decreasing @xmath38 , the discrete values of the parameter @xmath105 also decrease until relatively small values of @xmath38 .",
    "then , with @xmath38 further decreasing both parameters @xmath80 and @xmath119 start growing until some critical value of @xmath135 is reached near which parameters @xmath105 and @xmath136 tend to infinity and monopole solutions with given number of zeroes cease to exist .",
    "the lowest of these critical values is @xmath137 for unexcited monopole solution .",
    "the excited solutions disappear at greater values of @xmath38 .",
    "the mass of excited monopoles is well described by the formula ( [ gal - abmass ] ) , even for the lowest excited solution the difference with the exact numerical value is less then 4% for all values of @xmath38 .",

    "here we discuss one another aspect of the d - brane picture of gauge theories , which is the direct subject of the present workshop .",
    "recently it was discovered that gauge theories on noncommutative manifolds @xmath139=i\\theta_{\\mu\\nu}\\ ] ] are connected with the gauge theories on d - branes with the constant background kalb - ramond field @xmath140 turned on @xcite @xmath141 the relation between these two versions is non - local and is defined perturbatively through the seiberg - witten map @xcite ( for a more recent discussion see @xcite ) .",
    "namely , the ym theory on a noncommutative four - dimensional space @xmath142 defined using the star - product @xmath143 and the d - brane theory with @xmath144 are related perturbatively via @xmath145    the issue of magnetic monopoles in both treatments of the non - commutative ym was discussed recently in a number of papers @xcite .",
    "it was argued that bps - saturated monopoles exist in the non - commutative case as well .",
    "apart from the bps bound most of the previous discussion was perturbative in terms of the non - commutativity parameter @xmath146 .    adding the constant @xmath140-field spoils the spherical symmetry of monopoles and therefore their non - perturbative treatment in the d - brane picture becomes rather complicated .",
    "at best one can construct an axially symmetric model using @xmath147 as a kalb - ramond analog of the homogeneous magnetic ( electric ) field . even in this case",
    "the nbi model is still too complicated both for tr and str versions . here",
    "we give a non - perturbative monopole solution in the simplest case of the @xmath1 gauge field with abelian higgs .",
    "as was shown by gibbons @xcite , the system of bi @xmath1 and higgs fields possesses the boost symmetry ( in the mixed space of coordinates and the field variables ) which can be used as a solution generating technique to add a constant magnetic field to the pointlike magnetic monopole ( resp . electric field to the electric bion ) .",
    "reinterpreted as the kalb - ramond field , this homogeneous field may be accounted for the parameter of non - commutativity .",
    "we start with the dbi action @xmath148 with one external coordinate @xmath149 ( playing the role of the higgs field ) and introduce the magnetic potential @xmath150 @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the magnetic field strength  canonical conjugate to the magnetic induction @xmath153 : @xmath154    performing the corresponding legendre transformation we obtain the following hamiltonian functional @xmath155 which can be interpreted as the volume of the three - dimensional hypersurface parametrized by coordinates @xmath156 in the five - dimensional pseudoeuclidean space @xmath157 with the metric @xmath158 ( minus corresponds to @xmath150 ) .",
    "we use the symmetries of this functional to generate first the scalar charge from the monopole charge and then to generate a constant background field which will be then interpreted as the @xmath140 field .",
    "so we start with the spherically symmetric configurations .",
    "the field equations are then reduced to @xmath159 where prime denotes the derivative with respect to the radial variable @xmath56 .",
    "it is easy to see that two potentials should be proportional .",
    "depending on which potential dominates , one can find three different types of behaviour :    1 .   the spacelike vector in the @xmath160 plane . by some rotation the magnetic field can be removed .",
    "this is the catenoidal solution @xcite .",
    "since it does not exist for all @xmath56 , we will not consider it further .",
    "2 .   the timelike vector in the @xmath161 plane . by a rotation",
    "it can be reduced to a @xmath1 monopole without excitations of the transverse degrees of freedom .",
    "the potential for this particular solution ( with unit charge ) is @xmath162 and could be written explicitly in terms of elliptic integrals .",
    "3 .   the lightlike vector @xmath163 .",
    "this is the bps monopole : @xmath164    to obtain the non - bps monopole solution that also has a nonzero higgs counterpart @xmath165 one can simply perform a boost in the @xmath166 plane : @xmath167 the next step is to perform a boost in the @xmath168 plane to generate the constant background magnetic field . to understand why this field may be equally interpreted as a @xmath140 field one",
    "should notice that the field equations do not change if we replace @xmath6 by @xmath169 with constant @xmath140 .",
    "so , if we denote @xmath170 , then after the second boost we obtain : @xmath171 where @xmath172 and @xmath173 is defined by the eq.([gal - deff ] ) .",
    "this nonlinear equation can not be solved explicitly but it is simple to explore it numerically . the key point is to note that for a given @xmath174 , using equations ( [ gal - deff]),([gal - boost : eq ] ) , one can find the vector @xmath175 ( magnetic _ induction _ plus @xmath140-field ) .",
    "then the monopole field is obtained by subtracting the constant background . note",
    "that , depending on the values of the boosts parameters @xmath176 and @xmath177 , the solution can become double - valued .",
    "let us consider this feature in more detail .",
    "for magnetic monopole without excitations of the transversal component the three - dimensional hypersurface @xmath178 is spacelike everywhere except for the origin where it touches the lightcone .",
    "when we boost in the @xmath166 directions , the surface @xmath179 acquires the timelike piece which can cause multivaluedness after boosting in the @xmath168 directions .",
    "( when treated as a hypersurface in the five - dimensional space @xmath180 it remains of course spacelike ) .",
    "this effect is interpreted from the string theory point of view as tilting the d - brane , but from the point of view of 3-dimensional field theory this multivaluedness should be interpreted as a signal that no well defined solution exists .",
    "it is worth noting that for bps solution such multivaluedness emerges for any value of the background field .    in the figures [ gal - fig : fcurves],[gal - fig : ycurves ]",
    "the sections of level surfaces of constant @xmath149 and constant @xmath181 are shown .",
    "the full solution is axially symmetric and is obtained by rotating the pictures along the symmetry axis .",
    "we have discussed some new issues associated with the d - brane picture of gauge theories . apart from giving a nice geometric framework ,",
    "d - branes suggest a modification of the dynamics of the ym field suggesting the born - infeld type lagrangian .",
    "this latter breaks the conformal invariance of the ym equations removing the obstruction for existence of classical glueballs in the su(2 ) theory in four dimensions .",
    "topological reason for existence of such glueballs lies in the vacuum periodicity which holds equally in the ordinary ym theory and in the nbi theory , with an important difference that in the latter case the potential barriers between neighboring vacua have finite heights .",
    "classical nbi glueballs ( more precisely , half of them ) are sphalerons mediating the topological transitions .",
    "we have found that they exist both for the ordinary trace and the symmetrized trace versions of the nbi theory with somewhat different core structure .",
    "we have also shown that in the nbi theory with the triplet higgs one encounters , apart from the usual magnetic monopoles , the hybrid solutions which can be regarded as sphaleronic excitations of monopoles . finally , adding the constant kalb - ramond field , one is able to account for non - commutative monopoles .",
    "we presented a new nonperturbative axisymmetric solution for the u(1 ) non - commutative monopole with higgs .",
