    "recent experimental data , from the h1 collaboration  @xcite , on large transverse energy hadron production in deep - inelastic scattering have generated several theoretical papers attempting to explain the data within the framework of perturbative quantum chromodynamics in the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) approximation .",
    "these experimental results confirm and extend older data from h1   and zeus  @xcite .",
    "since these h1 and zeus data on forward hadrons as well as the data on forward jet  @xcite production at large transverse momentum probe the small bjorken-@xmath4 region , it was argued @xcite that they would be ideally suited to probe the balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov  @xcite ( bfkl ) regime , where the resummation of @xmath14 terms is important , and that they would show the breakdown of the dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi  @xcite ( dglap ) regime . in this respect",
    "the single hadron data are more relevant than the jet data since they cover a lower bjorken-@xmath4 range , down to @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "these data are also expected to be more accurate than the jet data because of the difficulty of jet identification at low transverse momentum and in the forward region .",
    "a comparison of older h1  @xcite results on single @xmath0 production , with a model based on lowest order matrix elements and parton cascades  @xcite , shows very strong disagreement between data and theory .",
    "the model falls much below the data ( a factor 5 to 10 at low @xmath5 and low @xmath4 ) and , besides , the shape of the @xmath4 dependence is incorrect . adding the contribution where the virtual photon is resolved  @xcite reduces somewhat the disagreement at large @xmath5 but falls short of the data at small @xmath5 unless a very large scale is chosen in the evaluation of the anomalous photon component  @xcite .",
    "however , predictions based on improved leading order bfkl dynamics  @xcite show a better overall agreement when compared to h1 data , specially at low @xmath5 , but they do not describe the @xmath5 evolution correctly  @xcite .    the recent theoretical developments concern mainly the calculation of the single hadron production in the nlo approximation  @xcite .",
    "higher order diagrams neglected in the earlier approaches modify the picture in several ways .",
    "they generate new topologies and new hard scattering processes which should be considered as new born terms .",
    "for example , at the lowest order ( lo ) the hard scattering terms are mediated by quark exchange while in the nlo approximation processes with gluon exchange appear and these become specially important  @xcite in the forward region where the presence of the gluon pole enhances such terms .",
    "also , at nlo , terms associated with the @xmath16 collinear component of the virtual photon , which build up the photon structure function ( the so - called resolved component ) , appear .",
    "as is well known , a  large \" logarithm arises , asymptotically of type @xmath17 when @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is the hadron transverse momentum in the @xmath20-proton center of mass frame here is called @xmath21 in ref .",
    "@xcite . ] ) , and is associated with this structure function , specially when the photon virtuality is small .",
    "this term can then be considered a leading order term although it technically appears when calculating higher order diagrams @xcite .",
    "this is the reason why it was introduced in  @xcite where it indeed helped improve agreement with the data .",
    "however , using a large scale in the photon structure function to enhance the resolved contribution appears artificial . indeed in an nlo calculation , the increase of the born resolved contribution is compensated by a decrease of the higher order direct contribution , not included in @xcite , in such a way that the sum is more stable under changes of scales .",
    "it should be stressed that single hadron production in deep - inelastic scattering experiments present a very stringent consistency test of perturbative qcd and its various input distributions : it involves the proton structure function as well as the hadronic fragmentation functions , all quantities rather precisely measured in other experiments . as just discussed it is also very sensitive to the virtual photon structure function  @xcite , which is less well known but which has been recently discussed in detail in  @xcite .",
    "the common features of recent nlo calculations  @xcite are the following .",
    "the cross section contains two ( complicated ) pieces : the  direct \" cross section , where the virtual photon couples directly to the hard process , and the  resolved \" cross section , where the photon acts as a composite object which is a source of collinear partons taking part in the hard subprocess .",
    "the direct contribution is calculated in the nlo approximation , _",
    "i.e _ up to @xmath22 ) , while the cross section involving the resolved component is calculated to lowest order ( lo ) accuracy with the photon scale compensating term included in the higher order part of the direct piece .",
    "no dglap type resummation is performed on the virtual photon structure function .",
    "using modern proton structure functions  @xcite and fragmentation functions  @xcite a very good agreement is achieved with the data when using a common ( renormalization , factorization and fragmentation ) scale set equal to @xmath23 .",
    "however all the above calculations exhibit the same large scale dependence of the predictions mainly associated with the renormalization scale as will be seen below . a rather large sensitivity of the predictions to the fragmentation functions",
    "is also observed , with the data clearly favoring  @xcite , like other hadronic data , the parametrization of kniehl , kramer and ptter  @xcite ( kkp ) over that of kretzer  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite a discussion is given to isolate the origin of the large corrections terms and it is found that they are associated with processes with a gluon exchange which are interpreted as the born terms of the bfkl ladder .",
    "the theoretical papers differ in the procedure to obtain the cross section : in @xcite a calculation of the single particle spectrum is performed with the infrared divergences compensated analytically while in @xcite a monte - carlo generator at the partonic level is constructed with a numerical compensation of divergences .    in @xcite , the first evaluation , at the nlo accuracy , of the resolved contribution",
    "is presented : it includes both the construction and the use of the nlo virtual photon structure function as well as the nlo calculation of the hard matrix elements for the resolved processes . in the limited phenomenological analysis",
    "performed , good agreement with the data is obtained with the scale @xmath24 , larger than that of the previous nlo calculations . the importance of the resolved contribution to the cross section is again emphasized and it is shown that its factorization scale dependence is reduced at the nlo accuracy compared to the lo calculation .",
    "it is then expected that the full cross section will be less scale sensitive than in the work of  @xcite .    in the following",
    "we present a detailed phenomenological study of hadron production in deep - inelastic scattering with both the direct and resolved contributions calculated at nlo accuracy .",
    "a special emphasis will be put on the study of the scale variation of the cross section to determine the domain where the perturbative qcd approach is reliable , _ i.e. _ stable under changes of scales .    in the next section we set up the theoretical framework and discuss the instabilities related to the various scales introduced in the calculation ( factorization scale @xmath25 on the proton side and @xmath26 on the photon side , fragmentation scale @xmath27 and factorization scale @xmath28 ) .",
    "a detailed comparison with the various experimental h1 distributions  @xcite is performed next : at small bjorken-@xmath4 the large corrections are found to be related to bfkl - like terms which appear in the nlo calculation in some approximation ( first corrections in @xmath29 ) . studying the @xmath5 dependence of the cross section will probe the photon structure function as it is expected to play a dominant role at low @xmath5 while at large @xmath5 the direct term is expected to dominate .",
    "finally , studying the rapidity @xmath30 or @xmath31 distributions , as well as the transverse momentum distribution of the pion will help constrain the quark and gluon fragmentation into pions .",
    "hadron production in dis experiments offers a very rich structure : it is a two scale problem , @xmath5 and @xmath32 , with a large variation in the ratio of these two scales allowing the testing of the theoretical results in different regimes .",
    "furthermore , the small @xmath5 limit makes it possible to make contact with photoproduction experiments .",
    "combining all the data will help in understanding the non - perturbative input to the photon structure function and its decreasing importance when the virtuality of the photon increases .",
    "it will give some insight on the transition from the non - perturbative to the perturbative regime , for the photon structure function .",
    "we first discuss the features of the resolved cross section which were not taken into account in the previous papers  @xcite . when calculating the higher order ( ho ) corrections to the direct contribution there appear configurations where the virtual photon turns into an almost collinear @xmath33-@xmath34 pair with the quark or the antiquark subsequently interacting with a parton from the proton .",
    "this ho contribution , in principle negligible for @xmath32 close to @xmath5 , is important when @xmath32 becomes large . in this case",
    "we can not content ourselves with the lowest order expression of the quark distribution in the virtual photon , proportional to @xmath35 .",
    "the latter must be replaced by a resummed lo or nlo expression .",
    "the standard procedure consists in subtracting from the ho corrections a term proportional to @xmath36 and to calculate a resolved contribution with fully evolved parton distributions at the factorization scale @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath37-dependence of the resolved part is partly compensated by the @xmath38 counterterm which remains in the direct ho contribution . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was argued that a physical choice for the factorization scale is @xmath39 with @xmath40 of order @xmath41 . with this scale ,",
    "the resolved component is negligible when @xmath42 , whereas it is large when @xmath43 . in the latter case , we recover the standard factorization scale @xmath44 of large-@xmath19 reactions .",
    "direct and resolved cross sections , calculated in the nlo approximation , have been discussed respectively in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite . here",
    ", we do not give the technical details of these calculations which can be found in the relevant references , but we summarize the main results that were obtained :    \\1 ) the ho corrections to the direct cross section are very large ( in the h1 kinematical domain ) and essentially come from graphs containing the exchange of a gluon in the @xmath45-channel .",
    "these graphs represent a zeroth order approximation to the bfkl ladder .",
    "\\2 ) the nlo direct cross section strongly depends on the renormalization scale @xmath28 .",
    "\\3 ) with the factorization scale @xmath46 the nlo resolved contribution is as large as the nlo direct one .",
    "therefore we have access , through this contribution , to the parton distributions in the virtual photon .",
    "\\4 ) with the  natural \" scale @xmath47 ,",
    "the total cross section is in good agreement with the h1 data , thus suggesting that a sizeable bfkl type contribution may not be necessary to explain the data .",
    "the second point above is important because it does not allow us to make stable predictions for the cross section and to assess the need for other contributions of the bfkl - type .",
    "preliminary studies of the renormalization scale dependence have been performed separately , for the direct cross section @xcite and the resolved cross section @xcite . here",
    "we would like to do a more complete study of the scale sensitivity of the total cross section , including also the effects of the various factorization scales .",
    "as is well known , only the total cross section has a physical meaning .",
    "the separate contributions , born terms , ho terms , direct or resolved terms are all factorization and renormalization scale dependent .",
    "since the direct and resolved nlo cross section are available , such a study of the scale sensitivity is now feasible .    before starting this study",
    "let us specify the various building blocks of the total cross section .",
    "for the parton distributions in the proton , we use the cteq6 m tables  @xcite , and for the distributions in the virtual photon the parametrization given in ref .  @xcite . in the latter",
    "this parametrization was used with fixed value of @xmath5 corresponding to the average value @xmath48 observed in a cross section .",
    "for instance for the cross section @xmath49 in the range @xmath50  gev@xmath51  gev@xmath52 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) , we used @xmath53  gev@xmath52 .",
    "this value corresponds to the overall bin @xmath54 .",
    "however this value changes with @xmath4 and the description of the whole @xmath4 domain by a single value @xmath48 is not accurate . therefore in this paper",
    "we use a parametrization depending continuously on @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath37 .",
    "we work in the @xmath55 renormalization and factorization schemes and all the scales are equal to @xmath56 .",
    "we take @xmath57 flavors and for @xmath58 we use an exact solution of the two - loop renormalization group equation with @xmath59  mev .",
    "the fragmentation functions of the partons in @xmath0 are those of ref .",
    "@xcite . with these inputs",
    "we obtain the cross section displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and compared with h1 data measured in the range 4.5  gev@xmath60  gev@xmath52 @xcite .",
    "our calculations are performed at @xmath61  gev and the forward-@xmath0 cross section is defined with the following cuts . in the laboratory system",
    "a @xmath0 is observed in the forward direction with @xmath62  ; the laboratory momentum of the pion is constrained by @xmath63 , and an extra cut is put on the @xmath0 transverse momentum in the @xmath64 center of mass system : @xmath65  gev .",
    "the inelasticity @xmath66 is restricted to the range @xmath67 .",
    "corresponding to the range 4.5  gev@xmath68  gev@xmath52 and @xmath69  gev compared to h1 data @xcite .",

    "we also notice the importance of the ho corrections to the resolved cross section .",
    "with respect to the corresponding figure of ref .",
    "@xcite , we note that the resolved component is larger at small @xmath4 and smaller at large @xmath4 , which improves agreement with data at large @xmath4 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the average @xmath48 is smaller at small @xmath4 than at large @xmath4 .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] is the starting point of our scale studies .",
    "we choose a kinematic region for which the ho corrections are large ( this is due to the small value of @xmath73  gev ) in order to better exhibit the scale dependence , but with the consequence ( as we shall see ) that the cross section does not stabilize for an optimum choice of the scales .",
    "let us define the factorization scales @xmath74 where @xmath75 stands for i ( the proton distribution scale ) or f ( the fragmentation function ( ff ) scale ) .",

    ", we observe very different behavior .",
    "the variation with @xmath81 is almost flat whereas that with @xmath27 is strongly decreasing .",
    "these differences are due to the different average values of @xmath82 , the proton distribution variable , and @xmath83 , the fragmentation function variable , corresponding to the kinematics of fig .  1 .",
    "in the direct process for instance , we have @xmath84 , a domain in which the proton distribution functions do not vary much with @xmath81 . for the fragmentation variable we have @xmath85 in the direct case , and @xmath86 in the resolved case . in these ranges , the variation of the fragmentation functions @xmath87 are not negligible ; the higher the value of @xmath83 , the stronger the variation .",
    "hence the different behavior of the direct and resolved contributions .",
    "moreover in the direct case , we observe that the ho corrections do not compensate the born term variation .",
    "this is due to the fact that the ho corrections contain new channels which appear as new born contributions for which there are no compensating @xmath88 terms .",
    "for instance , we have the opening of the new        channel corresponding to fig .",
    "4a with the final gluon fragmenting into a @xmath0 . at nlo",
    "there is no counter term which corrects this new born contribution .",
    "such terms would only appear at nnlo .",
    "the contribution of this new channel , involving the exchange of a gluon in the @xmath45-channel , is very large and the overall behavior of the nlo cross section is very similar to that of the born contribution . in the resolved contribution",
    "a graph with a gluon exchanged in the @xmath45-channel already exists at the born level and the ho corrections contain the appropriate counter term .",
    "however the compensation between the born contribution and the ho is not complete due to the large values of @xmath89 involved .     which has been defined in the text .",
    "the cross sections are normalized to 1.0 at @xmath90 the choice of kinematic conditions is the same as in fig.1.,title=\"fig:\",height=240 ]   which has been defined in the text .",
    "the cross sections are normalized to 1.0 at @xmath90 the choice of kinematic conditions is the same as in fig.1.,title=\"fig:\",height=240 ]   which has been defined in the text .",
    "the cross sections are normalized to 1.0 at @xmath90 the choice of kinematic conditions is the same as in fig.1.,title=\"fig:\",height=240 ]    let us now turn to the study of the variations with @xmath26 which are displayed in fig .  5 . in the variations studied till now , there was no compensation between the resolved and the direct terms .",
    "for instance , the @xmath81 dependence of the parton distributions in the photon were separately compensated by @xmath91 terms which appear in the direct or in the resolved ho corrections . however , for @xmath26 , we have compensation between the resolved and the direct terms that we can observe in fig .  5 . when @xmath26 increases the born+ ho@xmath71 direct contribution decreases .",
    "this is due to the fact that a term proportional to @xmath92 is subtracted from the ho corrections leaving a piece @xmath93 in the remaining ho@xmath71 part , as explained at the beginning of this section . on the other hand , the resolved contribution increases with the increase of the parton distributions in the virtual photon",
    "a counter term present in the ho resolved correction dampens the variation of the nlo cross section compared to the born case .",
    "more precisely , the scale variation of the photon structure function contains two pieces ( see _ i.e. _ eq .",
    "( 16 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) : the inhomogeneous part , proportional to @xmath94 , and the homogeneous or hadron - like part proportional to @xmath95 .",
    "the scale variation of the inhomogeneous part is compensated by the ho@xmath71 direct term , while that of the homogeneous part is in the ho resolved contribution . for a consistent calculation",
    "it is therefore necessary to work at the nlo level for both direct and resolved pieces . due to the compensation between the direct and the resolved contributions , the total cross",
    "section exhibits a smoother behavior when @xmath96 varies by a factor 20 .",
    "finally let us consider the variations as a function of the renormalization scale @xmath28 .     which has been defined in the text .",
    "the cross sections are normalized to one at @xmath97 the choice of kinematic conditions is the same as in fig.1 except for the rightmost panel , where the dash - dotted curve corresponds to the nlo cross section calculated in the bin @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 gev.,title=\"fig:\",height=240 ]   which has been defined in the text .",
    "the cross sections are normalized to one at @xmath97 the choice of kinematic conditions is the same as in fig.1 except for the rightmost panel , where the dash - dotted curve corresponds to the nlo cross section calculated in the bin @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 gev.,title=\"fig:\",height=240 ]   which has been defined in the text .",

    "we note the same phenomenon as observed for the @xmath27-scale variation : no compensation for the direct nlo term and a small compensation for the nlo resolved contribution .",
    "concerning the direct term , this behaviour again arises due to the opening of new channels , without virtual corrections ( they appear only at nnlo ) , containing terms in @xmath101 to compensate the @xmath28 dependence of @xmath102 . as these new born terms are proportional to @xmath103 and constitute a large part of the cross section @xcite , the variation of the latter is strong . on the other hand virtual corrections to terms containing a gluon exchanged in the t - channel",
    "are present in the resolved contribution .",
    "this produces the small effect observed in fig .  5 and we do not find any reasonable value of @xmath28 for which the cross section would reach an optimum .",
    "this is due to the large ho corrections corresponding to the small values of the transverse energy in the h1 kinematical domain studied here .",
    "indeed the h1 experiment puts a minimum cut - off on @xmath19 ( the transverse energy in the @xmath20-proton center of mass frame ) of 2.5 gev .",
    "this is a small value for a `` large-@xmath104 '' reaction and the resulting ho are large .",
    "however for higher values of the cut - off , the ho corrections are smaller and we find a @xmath28-variation of the resolved cross section which exhibits an optimum ( maximum ) point .",
    "for instance in ref .",
    "@xcite a cut - off @xmath105  gev was used and an optimum of the cross section was found for @xmath106 .    therefore we reach the conclusion that the addition of the nlo resolved component improves the behavior of the cross section with respect to the scale variation .",
    "however the sensitivity of the cross section to the renormalization scale variation prevents us from predicting absolute values for the latter .",
    "for instance , in the range @xmath107 , the predictions vary by a factor 2 .",
    "this fact clearly points towards the necessity of calculating nnlo corrections . for the time being with the aim of phenomenological applications in mind",
    ", we choose scales which lead to a good description of the data in the range 4.5  gev@xmath108  gev@xmath52 . as we can see from fig .  1 ,",
    "such an agreement is found with all scales set equal to @xmath109 . then with the same scales we make predictions for @xmath110 in the other @xmath5-ranges , as well as for @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "because of the marked scale sensitivity of the cross sections , scales giving a good description of data in a given @xmath5-range do not necessarily lead to a good agreement in another range .",
    "it turns out , as we shall see , that a satisfactory description of all the data can be obtained with this single choice of scales .",
    "of course the scale choice could be refined in order to improve the agreement between data and theory in fig .  1 , especially at small @xmath4 .",
    "but this is a formal exercise that does not present any physical interest .",
    "finally , to ameliorate some of our negative conclusions on the scale dependence of the cross section , we note that at larger @xmath5 and @xmath113 , the sensitivity to the renormalization scale is reduced . in fig .  6 ( rightmost panel )",

    "it seems to imply that there is no clear signal in the h1 data of the bfkl type resummation effects and that keeping only the lowest order term in the usual perturbative sense is justified .",
    "one reason may be the following . the bfkl result is derived for asymptotic energies . however , at hera the rapidity range , @xmath135 , available is not extremely large and threshold effects do not allow for the full formation of the bfkl ladder  @xcite .",

    "_  @xcite .",
    "we recall that the difference between these approaches and the present one lies in the fact that , in the former , no special consideration is given to the photon structure function : the nlo correction to the direct term contains a  large \" factor of type @xmath136 which amounts , in fact , to parametrizing the photon function by its lowest perturbative approximation .",
    "furthermore no nlo corrections are included in the resolved cross section .",
    "in contrast , in this work , we use both a nlo expression for the resolved photon structure function and we include the ho corrections to the resolved cross section . agreement with the data",
    "is obtained in all cases at the cost of using a different choice for the common scale . in @xcite and @xcite , as well as in our previous work",
    "@xcite , the scale @xmath137 was the appropriate choice . in this work",
    ", it is seen that the scale @xmath121 is preferred .",
    "the data do not obviously prefer one or the other of the two sets of calculations as the shape of the observables is not affected . in ref .",
    "@xcite a very large scale sensitivity was however observed : under the rather modest change from @xmath138 to @xmath121 the theoretical predictions vary by as much as a factor 2 in some cases , and , in any case , the theoretical uncertainties are much ( sometimes twice ) larger that the experimental ones ( statistic and systematic errors combined ) . in the current approach",
    "we expect a smaller sensitivity to the scales since more ho corrections are taken into account .",
    "besides , it is seen from figs",
    ".  [ fig:3 ] , [ fig:5 ] , [ fig:6 ] that the variation with the scales seems to decrease at higher scales .",
    "this is illustrated in figs .",

    "compared to the results of  @xcite , the scale variations are somewhat tempered and are of the same order as that of the rather large experimental errors .",
    "using the latest structure and fragmentation functions , the complete nlo calculation of the direct and resolved contributions to forward particle production in deep - inelastic scattering at hera , describes the data rather well in the wide kinematical range available : 2  gev@xmath143 70  gev@xmath52 , 2.5  gev @xmath144 15  gev .",
    "the importance of the nlo corrections to both the direct and resolved terms is pointed out .",
    "these large corrections are associated with new topologies involving gluon exchange in the hard sub - processes .",
    "these terms , which have no equivalent at the lowest order are interpreted as the first terms of the bfkl ladder .",
    "the data seem to indicate that resummation of such ladder diagrams is not necessary , probably because of the not so large rapidity phase space available .",
    "agreement between theory and data is achieved choosing a standard scale of the form @xmath121 .",
    "the variations under the proton factorization scale and the photon factorization scale are under control .",
    "however a rather large instability of the predictions is observed when varying independently the renormalization and the fragmentation scales .",
    "this prevents a really quantitative prediction for the single pion inclusive distribution in the forward region . in this respect",
    ", taking account of the ho resolved contribution improves the situation compared to calculations which ignored it but the situation is still far from satisfactory .",
    "we have checked that imposing a larger @xmath19 cut on the data reduces the scale sensitivity : for example , with the conditions @xmath123 7  gev and 4.5  gev@xmath143 15  gev@xmath52 the variation is @xmath145 for a scale variation as in fig .",
    "[ fig - xbj-25-scale ] .",
    "probably , the evaluation of the next - to - next - to - leading order terms is required to obtain reliable and stable perturbative predictions .",
