    "giant pulses from the millisecond pulsar b1937 + 21 were first noted by @xcite , and confirmed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite determined the main properties of gps of millisecond pulsars in their study based on 44 min of observation with the arecibo radio telescope at 430 mhz with a time resolution of 1.2 @xmath0s .",
    "they found that gps were seen in both the main pulse and the interpulse components .",
    "the gps were found to be very short in duration .",
    "they are delayed by 40 - 50 @xmath0s relative to the profile components of the regular emission , and they were highly circularly polarized , sometimes up to 100% .",
    "@xcite also established a power law energy distribution with the exponent of @xmath1 for the cumulative energy distribution .",
    "+ @xcite have published results of multifrequency observations of giant radio pulses from b1937 + 21 observed with the arecibo radio telescope at 430 , 1420 and 2380 mhz using a time resolution of 0.38 @xmath0s .",
    "they confirmed very short durations of gps only restricted by the scattering time at each frequency .",
    "although the multifrequency observations were not simultaneous , a mean radio spectrum was estimated to follow a power law with exponent @xmath2 3.1 , somewhat steeper than regular radio emission .",
    "@xcite presented an analysis of simultaneous dual - frequency observations of gps from psr b1937 + 21 , during about 3 hours with the kalazin 64-m radio telescope at 1420 mhz , and the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) at 2200 mhz .",
    "while more than a dozen gps were detected at kalazin and at wsrt , no events were found to occur simultaneously at both frequencies .",
    "thus , the instant radio spectra of gps are subject to deep modulation at a frequency scale of about @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite presented results of observations made at 1650 mhz with the tidbinbilla 70-m dss43 radio telescope with high time resolution .",
    "they have detected pulses as strong as 65000 jy with widths @xmath4 ns , corresponding to a brightness temperature of @xmath5 k.    in this paper we present a detailed analysis of 4.5 hours of data obtained in june 2005 with the gbt radio telescope in a 2052 - 2116 mhz frequency band using dual circular polarization .    in section  [ obs ]",
    "we describe the observations and data reduction . in section  [ polar ]",
    "we discuss our approach to calibration of polarization and we present the polarized profile of our calibrator psr b1929 + 10 .",
    "the average profile of b1937 + 21 in full polarization is described in section  [ prof ] . in section",
    "[ detect ] we explain the technique of gps detection , and in the following sections we present our results on polarization ( section  [ gps ] ) , statistics ( section  [ stat ] ) , and scattering ( section  [ scpr ] ) . our conclusions are summarized in section  [ disc ] .",
    "the observations were conducted in june 2005 with the 100-m robert c. byrd green bank telescope ( gbt ) at s - band ( 2052 - 2116 mhz ) using a vlbi mk5a terminal .",
    "two polarization channels ( rcp and lcp ) were recorded with the following frequency setup : 2068.0 and 2100.0 mhz sky frequencies , each with usb and lsb 16-mhz subbands sampled at the nyquist frequency ( 31.25 ns sampling time ) with 2-bit digitizing .",
    "thus , the configuration provided four 16-mhz conjugate bands per polarization potentially enabling 16 ns time resolution in each polarization channel .",
    "however we did not use such ultimate time resolution since scatter broadening was found to be about 100 ns , completely masking the intrinsic time shape of giant pulses ( see section  [ scpr ] for details ) .",
    "the calibration was performed by injecting a noise diode signal with level 2.1 k , and by observations of bright continuum sources 3c286 and 3c399.1 .",
    "conversion to flux density ( jy ) used noise diode amplitudes calibrated on 3c286 and 3c399.1 with flux densities from @xcite . the system equivalent flux density ( sefd )",
    "was estimated to be 11.2 jy , and the value was used to convert our measurements to jy throughout the paper .",
    "we believe that our flux calibration is within 10% in relative accuracy .",
    "pulsar b1929 + 10 was observed several times at different hour angles for polarization calibration .",
    "data , amounting to about 2 tb total , were recorded on mk5 diskpacks , copied to regular hard disks , and transferred to the processing site .",
    "data reduction started with mk5a data decoding with the `` mk5decode '' routine composed by v.kondratiev @xcite .",
    "the routine selects channels and converts 2-bit codes into floating point numbers -3 , -1 , + 1 , + 3 .",
    "this simple decoding was accompanied with corrections for two - bit statistics by the rules originally proposed by @xcite .",
    "such a correction is especially important in pulsar observations when a strong pulse is expected . for a strong pulse the threshold for discrimination between 1 and 3 does not correspond to a nominal 1 sigma level .",
    "efforts were made to remove several strong interfering signals in the radio spectra by substituting pseudo - random noise in the infected regions .",
    "the bandpass shape for each subband was individually corrected to provide a more efficient application of the predetection dispersion removal technique originally proposed by @xcite .",
    "some details of practical usage of the technique can be found in our previous publications : @xcite .",
    "dispersion removal was carried out separately for each frequency and polarization channel ( with 31.25 ns sampling time ) , but additional time shifts were simultaneously applied to different frequency channels , to align to the frequency of 2100 mhz .",
    "this last measure allows averaging data synchronously in all frequency channels , providing better sensitivity .",
    "the averaging became only possible after reduction of the raw data to real stokes parameters .",
    "raw observed stokes parameters were calculated after dedispersion , using the following expressions @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 represent the real and imaginary components of the complex analytic signal in the rcp(w ) and the lcp(x ) polarization channels .",
    "observations of the pulsar psr b1929 + 10 were used to estimate the instrumental cross - coupling terms of the gbt .",
    "the observed stokes parameters at maximum intensity in the average profile of psr b1929 + 10 are displayed in figure  [ fig.1 ] , plotted versus parallactic angle for each frequency band .",
    "following the recommendations of @xcite we use the following relation @xmath11 it was possible to decompose the original matrix @xmath12 as a combination of two matrices : a time - independent matrix @xmath13 , and a matrix @xmath14 describing the rotation of the telescope while tracking the radio source @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the parallactic angle . in the general case one needs to find all 16 unknown coefficients of @xmath17 , but @xcite simplified the procedure and reduced the number of unknown coefficients to 5 .",
    "we applied the combined method of turlo and mckinnon using our calibration measurements on psr b1929 + 10 presented in figure  [ fig.1 ] .",
    "we estimate depolarization @xmath18 , representing the linear polarization which appears as total intensity . the instrumental polarization @xmath19 represents the total intensity which appears as linear polarization .",
    "values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 have a value of 11% .",
    "these values were found to be the same in all four frequency channels while the instrumental phases are different .",
    "a similar cross - coupling , about 6.8% , occurs between the circular and linear polarization .",
    "we do not take into account the rotation measure correction between frequency bands which constitutes only @xmath22 .",
    "the recovered polarization profile of the psr b1929 + 10 is shown in figure  [ fig.2 ] .",
    "the profile was formed by averaging about 2800 pulses at parallactic angles of @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 . in the frame of the rotating vector model ( rvm ) @xcite one can estimate geometric parameters of the neutron star rotation by using the pa variation curve for the main pulse and interpulse longitudes ( not shown in figure  [ fig.2 ] ) .",
    "the curves indicate the fits to rvm : @xmath26+const , $ ] where @xmath27 is an angle between the spin axis and the magnetic axis , @xmath16 is an angle between the magnetic axis and the line of sight from earth , and @xmath28 is the angle between the rotation and the the line of sight",
    ". our estimates are @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the profile is in good agreement with the published data ( see , for example , @xcite ) .    according to the theory of radiation transfer developed by @xcite , the mean pulse for this pulsar is formed by the extraordinary mode ( the signs of the pa derivative and circular polarization are the same ) .",
    "polarization properties of the average profile for the millisecond pulsar b1937 + 21 were presented and discussed in several publications ( @xcite ) . in our study",
    "we have the best time resolution and good sensitivity compared with the above mentioned investigations .",
    "the average polarization profile obtained in our study with the gbt at s - band is shown in figures  [ fig.3 ] and [ fig.4 ] with time resolution of 312.5 ns ( 10-points time smoothing ) , constructed by summing all four frequency bands .",
    "the ephemeris and value of the dispersion measure dm=71.0398  pc  @xmath31 were taken from @xcite and corrected by the observed time of arrival of gps ( dm=71.029  pc  @xmath31 ) .    in general our results",
    "agree with previous studies , but we would like to note some peculiarities .",
    "we confirm the nearly flat shape of pa with longitude over the major portion of the main pulse and over the full range of longitudes at the interpulse .",
    "note , that the nearly 90-degree jump in the pa curve coincides with the sudden increase of circular polarization , and the flat portion of the pa curve covers continuously the tail of the whole main component including the second distinct component of the main pulse .",
    "in fact , the observed jump in the pa is not equal to @xmath32 , but is definitely closer to @xmath33 ; this peculiarity was also found by @xcite .",
    "we did distinguish very well the presence of an extended weak component preceding the main one .",
    "it is interesting to stress that the pa curve for this pulsar is flat . according to @xcite ,",
    "this is typical of millisecond pulsars , in which the polarization characteristics are formed near the light cylinder , where the magnetic field of a neutron star is close to uniform .",
    "searches for giant pulses were conducted in full intensity i averaged over all frequency bands ( 8 channels altogether ) , with the resulting root mean square deviation ( rms ) of @xmath34jy .",
    "such a signal follows @xmath35 statistics with 16 degrees of freedom .",
    "it is well known that gps from the millisecond pulsar b1937 + 21 are very short @xcite , but still they may have slightly different durations , and we tried several cases of time averaging by 1 , 3 , 5 , and 7 points to get the best snr for a given gp . for each case we applied a particular threshold for the detection .",
    "the values of the thresholds used are given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    ".gp detection thresholds for various signal times [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     if we disregard the multiple frequency structure , we can use the value of @xmath36 mhz . with this value of @xmath37",
    "we have a scintillation intensity modulation in the total @xmath38 mhz band being significantly reduced ( @xmath39 ) . therefore our analysis of energy distribution was not affected by the scintillations .",
    "we noticed two time intervals of gp activity that may be connected with scintillation effects .",
    "the region of high activity was about one hour duration , and the region of low activity was about three hours .",
    "let us review our findings :    \\1 ) the observed durations of gps from psr b1937 + 21 reflect mainly scatter broadening of about 100  200 ns , while the intrinsic time width was unresolved ( @xmath40 30 ns ) .",
    "\\2 ) our analysis of polarization properties of gps revealed random behavior of polarization with occasional pulses showing high linear polarization as well as high circular polarization of both signs , in contrast to the average profile of regular radio emission .",
    "such polarization properties impose strong constraints for theoretical models explaining physical nature of gps .",
    "\\3 ) the cumulative probability distribution in energy was obtained based on a large volume of statistical data down to 3 jy@xmath41s .",
    "the cpd demonstrated that there is no cutoff at low energies , i.e. the weakest gps merge smoothly with the regular component of radio emission .",
    "\\4 ) the cpd has a definite break in the power law exponent at energies equal to 30.2 and 20.1 jy@xmath42s for the mpgps and ipgps respectively . at these energies",
    "the exponent changes its value from @xmath43 to @xmath44 , i.e. approximately by @xmath45 .",
    "the same behavior was found for the cpd crab pulsar gps , as published by @xcite .",
    "thus , an observed break in the exponent of the power law dependence of the cpd seems to be intrinsic to the mechanism of the generation of giant radio pulses .",
    "the above mentioned properties fit very well the explanation given by @xcite in his model of origin of gps as a result of the reconnection of the last open / close magnetic field line ( mfl ) . in a case of nearly perpendicular rotation (",
    "magnetic axis is perpendicular to the axis of rotation ) the last open mfl , when reconnected , will join regions of the polar caps with different signs of electric potential @xmath46 thus leading to a strong electric discharge and plasma particle creation and acceleration .",
    "istomin proposes specific maser amplification of plasma waves induced by a two - stream instability .",
    "the model expects large circular components in polarization of gps .",
    "what is interesting , istomin s model predicts a power law dependence for the cpd with the exponent @xmath47 or @xmath48 depending on the power density of plasma generated inside the discharge tube .",
    "thus , such a transition from one energy state to another may be accompanied by a break point in cpd .",
    "this work was based on gbt observations conducted within the project gbt05b-038 .",
    "our study was supported by the russian foundation for basic research ( project code 10 - 02 - 0076 ) and the basic research program of the presidium of the russian academy of sciences on `` the origin , structure , and evolution of objects in the universe '' .",
