    "the spin seebeck effect refers to the generation of spin currents by an applied temperature gradient , or to the resulting voltage often induced by the so - called inverse spin hall effect ( ishe ) .",

    "our model is basically a simple treatment based on the boltzmann equation , but applied to the bands formed by the landau levels in an n - type semiconductor when there is a strong magnetic field parallel to the temperature gradient .",
