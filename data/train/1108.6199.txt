    "the experimental discovery of graphene has precipitated wide - ranging research to fully determine the physical properties of this novel material and to pave the way for its application in future technological devices.@xcite of particular interest is the potential for graphene - based spintronic devices to be realised , and thus much attention has been focused on determining the magnetic properties of graphene.@xcite the existence of spin - polarised edge states , predicted by many theoretical works,@xcite when a graphene sheet is cut to have a so - called _ zigzag _ edge geometry has underpinned a large number of these proposed devices .",
    "narrow stripes of graphene , dubbed graphene nanoribbons ( gnrs ) , with parallel zigzag edges , predicted to have opposite spin orientation , in particular are proposed.@xcite the other principal nanoribbon geometry , the armchair case , does not display such interesting spin polarised edges .",
    "gnrs with zigzag and armchair edge geometries are shown schematically in the top panels of fig .",

    ", experimental validation of their properties has so far been inconclusive , due to the difficulty in patterning the edge geometries required for these effects to be observed .",
    "furthermore , the spin - polarised edge state in zigzag - edged gnrs is predicted to be highly dependent on the edge geometry and not particularly robust under the introduction of edge disorder in the form of vacancy defects or impurity atoms.@xcite these factors present major obstacles in the path of utilizing the intrinsic magnetic edge states of graphene in experimentally realisable devices .",
    "another possibility that has been proposed is the exploitation of defect - driven magnetic moments that arise in graphene.@xcite magnetic moments have been predicted to form around vacancies and other defects in the graphene lattice and the possibility of engineering a ferromagnetic state in graphene from such moments has been suggested .",
    "however , such a claim would seem to be restricted by the implications of the lieb theorem,@xcite which states that any such magnetic moments arise from a disparity between the two sublattices of graphene .",
    "large - scale , randomised disorder would tend to minimise such a disparity and prevent the formation of a ferromagnetic state .",
    "a third possibility for incorporating graphene in spintronic devices lies in the doping of graphene systems with magnetic impurity atoms .",
    "this approach takes advantage of the indirect exchange coupling , often referred to as the rkky coupling,@xcite between magnetic impurities embedded in a graphene system which is mediated by the conduction electrons of the graphene host .",
    "although this coupling is predicted to decay rapidly in graphene sheets,@xcite the quasi - one - dimensional nature of nanoribbons suggests that a much longer range coupling may persist in these materials for certain impurity configurations , in a similar manner to that found in carbon nanotubes.@xcite    , of zigzag chains ( zgnrs ) or dimer lines ( agnrs ) across their width . in each case",

    "we shall demonstrate here that the principal features of this dependence derive from the underlying electronic structure of the gnr host . in section [ model ]",
    "we show how the dependence can be calculated using a simple tight - binding representation of the graphene electronic structure combined with a self - consistent mean field description of the impurity species . in section [ singleimps ] ,",
    "the features of the dependence will be investigated and the effect of the ribbon geometry and the nature of the impurity considered .",
    "the reliability of these results will be demonstrated by comparison to a full ab - initio treatment of mn inpurities embedded into graphene nanoribbons .",
    "the nature of these features will be described comprehensively by considering the two principal gnr geometries , armchair and zigzag edges , for the case of two impurity configurations - substitutional atoms replacing a single carbon atom in the graphene lattice , and centre adsorbed atoms sitting in the centre of a hexagon of carbon atoms .",
    "these two configurations are shown schematically in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ schematic ] . in section [ edgedis ]",
    "the effects of edge disorder on the magnitude of the magnetic moments formed at the various impurity sites across the ribbon are examined .",
    "we find that an edge vacancy only has a significant effect on moments formed on neighbouring sites , and that the moment profile quickly returns to that of the pure ribbon when we move a few carbon chains away from the vacancy .",
    "this illustrates the relative robustness of magnetic moments introduced into graphene systems through transition metal doping compared with those arising intrinsically , which are unstable in the presence of edge disorder.@xcite",
    "the electronic structure of the system is described using a hubbard - like hamiltonian @xmath1 , where @xmath2 represents the electronic kinetic energy plus a spin - independent local potential , and @xmath3 is the electron - electron interaction term .",
    "the operator @xmath4 creates an electron with spin @xmath5 in atomic orbital @xmath6 on site @xmath7 .",
    "the graphene electronic structure is described using a single - orbital nearest - neighbour tight - binding model .",
    "the low - energy properties of graphene are known to be well reproduced within this framework .",
    "the magnetic impurities are described by a five - fold degenerate @xmath8 band representing a typical transition - metal magnetic atom . within @xmath9",
    ", we set the onsite energy of the carbon atoms to zero .",
    "the carbon - carbon nearest - neighbour hopping is @xmath10 , and we set @xmath11 as our unit of energy . however a correction to the hopping parameter at the edge of armchair ribbons , @xmath12 , is needed in order to achieve the expected semiconducting behaviour for all ribbon widths.@xcite the exact value of the hopping parameter between the carbon atoms of the graphene lattice and the magnetic impurity atom , @xmath13 , will depend on the impurity atom chosen and can be calculated in a number of ways .",
    "while the magnitude of this parameter can amplify the value of the magnetic moment , it is not expected to have a significant qualitative effect on the moment profile across the width of the ribbon .",
    "we assume that @xmath3 is an on - site interaction which takes place between electrons occupying the @xmath8 orbitals of the transition metal impurities only , and is neglected elsewhere . in this case",
    ", the matrix elements of the spin - dependent part of the hamiltonian reduce to @xmath14 , where @xmath15 represents the local exchange splitting associated with orbital @xmath6 , and @xmath16 for @xmath17 and @xmath18 spin , respectively .",
    "for simplicity we shall assume that the onsite effective exchange integrals @xmath19 are the same for all @xmath8 orbitals , whence it follows that @xmath15 is @xmath6-independent and equal to @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the local magnetic moment .",
    "the value of @xmath21 , and hence @xmath22 , along with the spin - independent contribution to the onsite energies of the transition metal atoms , @xmath23 , is calculated self - consistently within the mean field approximation under constraints imposed by the values of the onsite exchange integral @xmath19 and the d - band occupation @xmath24 .",
    "the d - band occupation is calculated at each stage in the self - consistent procedure by an integral over the density of states , which comes directly from the diagonal element of the real - space green function associated with the gnr - impurity system .",
    "this can be calculated in turn from the recursively calculated green function for the pristine gnr using the dyson equation .",
    "the dft calculations were performed by considering a substitutional or adsorbed mn impurity located at different positions across the width of zigzag and armchair nanoribbons .",
    "these calculations were carried out using the siesta code@xcite with the systems placed in a supercell so that the calculations were performed using periodic boundary conditions .",
    "double - zeta plus polarization functions were employed and the exchange - correlation function was adjusted using the generalized gradient approximation according to the parametrization proposed by perdew , burke and ernzerhof.@xcite the interactions between the ionic cores and the valence electrons were described with normconserving troullier - martins pseudopotentials.@xcite the structural optimizations were performed with the conjugate gradient approximation@xcite until the residual forces were smaller than 0.05 ev /  .",
    "care must be taken when performing dft calculations within a periodic supercell as moment suppression can occur if neighbouring moments prefer an antiferromagnetic alignment , but are forced to adopt a ferromagnetic alignment by the periodicity of the system.@xcite the proper emergence of moments in all our calculations suggests that antiferromagnetic alignment is not an issue in this case , an assertion supported by the energetically favourable ferromagnetic alignment between mn impurities in carbon nanotubes,@xcite a similar material .",
    "edge disorder is considered by introducing vacancies at edge sites in the ribbon . within the simple model ,",
    "these vacancies are introduced by placing a very large on - site potential ( @xmath25 ) on the lattice site containing the vacancy .",
    "this is a simplified approach that does not take into account lattice deformation effects that may occur when an atom is removed , but is adequate to describe the electronic effects of removing the relevant orbital from that lattice site .",
    "it is worth highlighting that this simplification only occurs in the simple model and that the dft calculations discussed earlier for systems without edge disorder fully account for relaxation .",
    "we present results for two magnetic impurity configurations - the case of a substitutional atom replacing a carbon atom and also that of a centre - adsorbed impurity sitting in the centre of a hexagon of carbon atoms . for the latter case",
    "we assume that the hopping parameters connecting the impurity atom to the lattice are equivalent for each of the neighbouring six carbon atoms .",
    "the impurity is moved across the finite width of the ribbon and the self - consistent value for @xmath21 is calculated at each site .",
    "we consider both the zigzag and armchair geometries and a comparison is made for all cases with a full density functional theory calculation . for a simpler qualitative comparison ,",
    "the quantity of interest is the relative fluctuation of the magnitude of the moment around its value at the centre of the ribbon , @xmath26 .",
    "this is given by @xmath27 .",
    "fig [ figsubs ] shows the magnetic moment fluctuation as function of impurity location for substitutional impurities across the width of a 6-zgnr and a 11-angr . for the case of zigzag ribbons , we first note an excellent qualitative match between the simple model and the full dft calculation , from which we infer that the underlying mechanism for the variation in the magnetic moments across the ribbon width is the electronic structure of the nanoribbon .",
    "the position dependence arises from quantum interference effects caused by the boundary conditions imposed on the electronic stucture of graphene in the form of the edges of the nanoribbons .",
    "furthermore , we note that the parameters @xmath13 , @xmath24 and @xmath19 which characterise the magnetic species in our simple model can be altered to achieve a better numerical fit , but do not affect the qualitative form of this plot .",
    "the pattern observed is a jagged , sawtooth style curve , characteristic of properties measured across the width of zigzag ribbons and a similar feature can be seen in the binding energies of impurities.@xcite this feature is a sublattice effect which arises from the degeneracy breaking that occurs between the two sublattices of graphene when a zigzag edge is formed .",
    "the sublattices are represented schematically in fig .",
    "[ schematic ] by black or white circles .",
    "each edge of the ribbon is occupied by sites entirely from one of the sublattices , and that sublattice is `` dominant '' on that half of the ribbon . for the case of impurity magnetic moments on zigzag ribbons ,",
    "this effect manifests itself in creating larger moments on impurities located on the dominant sublattice on either side of the ribbon . in other words ,",
    "impurity atoms on a black site on the side of the ribbon with black edge sites will have larger moments than their neighbouring white sites . focusing on a single sublattice , we find that the trend across the ribbon width is for the largest moment to arise on the dominant edge site for that sublattice , to decrease as the impurity is moved towards the centre of the ribbon and to reach its minimum value at the sites neighbouring the opposite edge .",
    "we note the all the features discussed here arise in both the simple model and the dft results , confirming that this is not simply an artifact of our simple model .    the corresponding plots for the armchair case do not agree with each other as convincingly .",
    "the tight - binding model is found to underestimate the value of the edge moment found by the dft calculation .",
    "this is because the tight - binding calculation does not take into account the distortions in the honeycomb lattice that arise when a substitutional impurity is introduced near the edge of an agnr .",
    "the relaxed structures ( not shown here ) for the two impurity sites nearest the ribbon edge are found to be considerably perturbed compared to the pristine ribbon and also to the relaxed structures corresponding to the other impurity sites .",
    "the shape of the tight - binding plot for agnrs is also found to be more dependent on the parameterisation of the impurity than in the zigzag case .",
    "this issue will be explored further in the case of centre - adsorbed impurities .",
    "this suggests that the moment profile across agnrs is not as robust as that observed in the zgnr case , and will vary somewhat according to the magnetic species chosen .",
    "however , both tight - binding and dft models find that the edge impurity sites lead to larger magnetic moments than the central ones .",
    "[ figsubs ] also reveals that the sublattice effect noted in zigzag - edged ribbons is absent in the case of armchair edges .",
    "this is explained from a cursory inspection of fig .",
    "[ schematic ] where it is obvious that the degeneracy between black and white lattice sites is unbroken by the imposition of armchair edges .",
    "the value of the magnetic moment approaches @xmath26 much quicker for agnrs , and only minor deviations from it are observed away from the edges of the ribbon , whereas in zgnrs significant deviations are still present deeper into the ribbon .",
    "the dramatic increase observed in the magnetic moment in impurities near the edge of zigzag ribbons is consistent with the presence of a localised edge state at the fermi energy .",
    "this state results in a large peak in the density of states at the fermi energy .",
    "such a peak provides favourable conditions for moment formation under the stoner criterion@xcite , and indeed if an intrinsic electron - electron interaction is considered in an undoped zgnr , will lead to the formation of the spin polarised edges as discussed in the introduction .       and @xmath28 respectively .",
    "we note this parameter does not affect the qualitative features of the moment profile across the zgnr , but alters that across the agnr significantly.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    fig .",
    "[ figcent ] shows the magnetic moment fluctuation for a centre - adsorbed impurity at various sites across a gnr , calculated again using both the simple model and a full dft approach ( black cirlces ) . within the simple model approach we consider two values of @xmath13 , the hopping parameter between the impurity atom and surrounding lattice sites .",
    "the values considered are @xmath29 ( red squares ) and @xmath30 ( blue triangles ) . for the case of zgnrs ( top panel )",
    ", we note the impressive qualitative match between the models .",
    "furthermore we note that the change in hopping parameter does not effect the qualitative shape of the plot , but can be used to yield a better fit .",
    "we also note that , unlike the substitutional impurity considered earlier , the sublattice effect is no longer present .",
    "this is because the impurity is no longer strongly associated with a particular sublattice , but instead binds to three carbon atoms from each , which has the effect of averaging out any sublattice dependent effects .",
    "the general trend of a monotonic increase in the magnetic moment of the mn impurity is noted as it is moved towards the centre of the ribbon .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the result for substitutional impurities , where the largest moment is observed at the edge and , for the dominant sublattice , the moment decreases as the impurity is moved towards the centre of the ribbon .",
    "the discrepancy can be explained by the fact that the centre - adsorbed mn impurity induces fluctuations in the magnetic moments on nearby sites in the graphene lattice .",
    "edge atoms are particularly susceptible to magnetic moments due to the localised state discussed before , and thus have larger induced deviations in their moments than the others .",
    "consequently , centre - adsorbed impurities atoms at the edge of a zgnr tend to induce large moment deviations on the edge sites , resulting in a smaller moment on the impurity atom itself .",
    "this is verified by examining the spin - density plots from the dft calculation for the case of centre - adsorbed impurities near the edge of a zgnr .",

    "it is clear that the centre - adsorbed impurity nearest the edge introduces a much larger disturbance to the values of the magnetic moments on surrounding sites than the more centrally located impurity .",
    "in fact the magnetic edge states are seen to be essentially unperturbed by the latter .",
    "in contrast to these dft calculations , the simple model does not account for the intrinsic magnetic edge states on zgnrs .",
    "however a similar moment profile is recovered as the magnetic impurity atom induces moments , rather than fluctuations of existing moments , on the surrounding lattice sites and these are found to be significantly larger for the case of the centre - adsorbed impurity nearest the ribbon edge .",
    "m0.19 m0.3      &   +    however , in zigzag ribbons there is an additional type of adsorption site which consists of an impurity atom bound to two edge sites and the site between them .",
    "this configuration , which we shall label `` edge - adsorbed '' ( ea ) , is illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ zz_edge ] .",
    "it can be viewed as an impurity atom connecting to half a hexagon of the graphene lattice .",
    "as this site only occurs at the edge , we can not study the position dependence of it .",
    "however , dft calculations reveal that a larger moment arises here than for the centre - adsorbed ato locamted nearest the ribbon edge and furthermore that the edge - adsorbed configuration is also more energetically favourable than any of centre - adsorbed sites .",
    "this is clear from the right - hand side panels of fig .",
    "[ zz_edge ] .",
    "the upper panel shows the moment fluctuation for the ea case compared with those of the centre adsorbed locations across a 8-zgnr .",
    "the bottom panel plots the segregation energy function , @xmath31 , for the same cases .",
    "this quantity , introduced in ref .",
    "[ @xcite ] , plots the relative deviation of the binding energy of an impurity on a gnr , @xmath32 , around its value at the centre of the ribbon , @xmath33 .",
    "the edge - adsorbed case is found to be the most energetically favourable .",
    "a spin density plot for this type of impurity is shown in the bottom left panel of fig .",
    "[ zz_edge ] and reveals that this impurity configuration has a less dramatic effect on the moments of nearby edge sites than the centre - adsorbed case on the edge hexagon , consistent with larger moment found for the ea configuration .    in the results for adsorbed mn impurities on an agnr in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ figcent ] we notice that for the dft result , and the simple model calculation with @xmath34 the edge hexagonal site has a smaller moment on it than the other sites .",
    "however the deviation in the value of the edge moment , and indeed of the moment at any site , from @xmath26 is far smaller than in the zgnr case .",
    "the moment profile in this case is essentially flat , with only minor deviations from @xmath26 across the width of the ribbon .",
    "examining the case of @xmath35 reveals that the shape of the profile across the ribbon is less robust than the zigzag case as the edge moment here is found to be slightly larger than @xmath26 . of the cases",
    "examined , the effect is weakest here and does not appear to be very robust .",
    "thus the position dependence of magnetic impurities is smallest for adsorbed impurities on agnrs and can not be deemed a significant effect .",
    "in this section the robustness of the features discussed in the previous section will be examined in the presence of edge vacancy defects .",
    "this is an important point to consider when comparing impurity - driven magnetic moments in gnrs to those arising intrinsically due the edge states , which have been shown to be particularly vulnerable to edge disorder.@xcite for each of the cases discussed in the previous section we examine the effect of a single edge vacancy on the magnitude of a nearby moment , calculated with the mean - field hubbard model approach .",

    "[ edge1 ] shows the effect of an edge vacancy on the magnetic moments of substitutional impurities in a 6-zgnr ( left ) and an 11-agnr ( right ) . to show the range of the effect we plot the relative change in the moment when an edge vacancy is introduced as a function of distance between the edge vacancy and the unit cell containing the magnetic impurity atom .",
    "note that in this case we are plotting the fluctuation of each moment relative to its value at its current position in a system without edge defects , not relative to its value at the centre of the ribbon as was shown previously .",
    "this plot is shown for a number of possible sites for the magnetic impurity across the width of the ribbon , namely the edge atom on the same side as the vacancy , the site next to the edge , a site at the centre of the ribbon and a site at the opposite edge , as shown schematically in the upper panels .",
    "for the zgnr , the first point to note is that the only sites that show a considerable change in their moments are the first two cases .",
    "the edge site has a slight reduction in the value of its moment , whereas the site next to the edge and belonging to the opposite sublattice to the edge has a significant increase in magnetic moment .",
    "however , the first point in this curve corresponds to a site neighbouring the edge vacancy . excluding this",
    ", the largest deviation in magnetic moment does not exceed 5% .",
    "however , for all positions , the moment reverts very quickly back to its value without the vacancy when it is moved further away down the ribbon .",
    "this suggests that a single edge vacancy will have very little effect on the moments of magnetic impurities located more than a lattice spacing or two away .",
    "the agnr case is quite similar .",
    "moving away from the vacancy the deviations in the moments again become very small .",
    "it is clear that significant deviations in the moments of substitutional impurities are not seen outside the immediate vicinity of the edge vacancy in either ribbon geometry .",

    "the effect here is even smaller than for the substitutional case , with fluctuations of less than 2% at distances greater than two unit cells away from the edge vacancy for all impurity types considered , including the edge - adsorbed case in zgnrs .",
    "a single edge vacancy has been shown not to have a significant effect on the magnetic moments of transition metal impurities in a gnrs .",
    "in fact , even the introduction of an extended edge defect , consisting of a length of ribbon to either side of the magnetic impurity with a certain concentration of edge vacancies , does not considerably affect the impurity moments unless there is an edge vacancy in their immediate vicinity .",
    "we conclude that magnetic moments introduced into gnrs by transition metal doping are particularly stable and robust in the presence of edge disorder .",
    "in particular , the striking moment profiles seen for magnetic impurities in zgnrs will not be significantly perturbed by the introduction of a reasonably strong extended edge disorder .",

    "carbon atoms from the edge zigzag chain at either edge of the ribbon are removed with a probability of 10% .",
    "this plot shows the result of an average over 50 such configurations , with the error bars on each point indicating the standard deviation .",
    "the moment profile is seen to not vary significantly from that of pristine case , demonstrating clearly the robustness of the moment profile .",
    "we have demonstrated the features of the magnetic moment variation of a magnetic impurity as its location is varied across the width of a graphene nanoribbon . for zigzag - edged nanoribbons we found an excellent agreement between the simple self - consistent hubbard model and a more complete _ ab initio _ treatment .",
    "furthermore the qualitative features of the resulting moment profile remained constant for different parameterisations describing the magnetic impurity , suggesting that they hold for a wide range of magnetic species .",
    "for substitutional impurities , a nonmonotonic behaviour connected to the sublattices of the graphene atomic structure was identified . for this type of impurity , a larger moment",
