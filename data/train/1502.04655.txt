    "this nearby star likely remained undiscovered for so long due to its combination of proximity to the galactic plane ( @xmath11 = + 2@xmath12.3 ) , optical dimness ( @xmath13 = 18.3 ) , and low proper motion ( @xmath00.1 yr@xmath6 ) .",

    "classification as a metal - poor subdwarf is ruled out , and given the correlation between metallicity and kinematic properties for m - type stars @xcite , it is unlikely that w0720 belongs to either the thick disk or halo .",
    "among 890 nearby solar - type stars from a chromospheric activity - velocity catalog @xcite , only 3 have galactic velocity components within @xmath1010 kms@xmath6 of w0720 s velocity ( hip 51500 , 63851 , 117499 ) , and all three are less chromospherically active than our sun ( logr@xmath26 @xmath27 -4.95 ) and have inferred chromospheric ages in the range 4 - 8 gyr @xcite .",

    "approximately 79% of the simulations brought w0720 within 0.337 pc of the sun , the previously closest estimated pass of a known star to the solar system ( gliese 710 ; 0.337 pc , 1.4 myr in the future ; * ? ? ?",
    "approximately 99.96% of the simulated trajectories brought the star within the sun s tidal radius of 1.35 pc @xcite , and 98% of the simulated trajectories brought the star within the maximal range of semi - major axes for retrograde orbiting oort cloud comets ( @xmath0120 kau ) @xcite . the rarity of stellar passes with such a small impact parameter can be assessed from the analysis of @xcite . extrapolating the power - law distribution of minimum separations versus cumulative number of encounters per myr from @xcite ,",
    "one estimates that encounters by stellar systems within 0.25 pc of the sun occur with a frequency of 0.11 myr@xmath6 or once every @xmath09.2 myr . for comparison , flybys this close ( 0.25 pc ) are statistically rare ( @xmath02.4% ) among encounters by all stellar systems that penetrate the sun s tidal radius of @xmath01.35 pc @xcite , of which @xmath04.5 occur per myr @xcite .",

    "major comet showers , where the flux of long - period comets increases by factors of @xmath910 are likely limited to cases of high mass interlopers passing within @xmath010 kau of the sun @xcite , and are exceedingly rare ( @xmath710@xmath57 myr@xmath6 ; extrapolating from results by * ? ? ?",

    "although comets throughout the oort cloud may be perturbed by an interloper star onto trajectories that would bring them to the inner solar system @xcite , the highest density of outer oort cloud comets should exist at smaller orbital distances @xcite , so most of the perturbed comets should originate from the vicinity of the star s closest pass to the sun .",

    "simulations by @xcite suggest that encounters with @xmath59 @xmath7 10@xmath63 are unlikely to generate an enhancement in the distribution of longitudes for long - period comets compared to that predicted to be generated by galactic tidal effects .",
    "all of the 10@xmath31 simulated orbits had @xmath59 @xmath7 10@xmath64 , hence the pass of the w0720 system should have a negligible statistical impact on the flux of long - period comets during the coming millenia .",
    "the proximity of w0720 s flyby to the solar system can be compared to those of _ hipparcos _",
    "stars recently studied by @xcite .",
    "he identified one star ( hip 85605 ) with a flyby closer than the median minimum separation that we estimated for w0720 ( 0.25 pc ) , however two future flybys ( hip 89825 [ gl 710 ] and hip 63721 ) both have @xmath32 @xmath15 0.27 pc ( 0.27@xmath65 pc and 0.27@xmath66 pc , respectively ; 90%cl ) .",
    "@xcite predicts that hip 85605 will pass within @xmath32 = 0.10@xmath67 pc ( 90% cl ) of the sun @xmath0332 kyr in the future .",
    "unfortunately , as @xcite points out , hip 85605 is a visual binary , and there is considerable dispersion in its published proper motions and its _ hipparcos _ parallax is of low accuracy .",
    "the solution which brings hip 85605 close to the sun relies on the tycho-2 proper motion ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 = + 4.0 , -7.6 @xmath10 2.0 , 1.9 masyr@xmath6 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the revised _ hipparcos _",

    "* as reported in the xhip compiled catalog ; ) .",
    "if any of these values are substantially in error , then the proximity of the flyby solution is likely to be spurious . both the original and revised _",
    "astrometric solutions @xcite had much larger proper motions than the tycho-2 solution .",
    "@xcite mentions that a reanalysis of the _ hipparcos _ astrometric solution by f. van leeuwen suggests `` _ that the _",

''    unfortunately , the _ hipparcos _ parallax for hip 85605 leads to some astrophysical inconsistency . as @xcite note ,",
    "hip 85605 s b - v color ( 1.1 mag ) is consistent with a k - type star , whereas the absolute magnitude calculated using its revised _",
    "parallax ( m@xmath68 = 11.86@xmath100.45 mag ) is more consistent with an m dwarf .",

    "dave latham ( priv . comm . )",
    "has visually confirmed that five spectra of hip 85605 taken with the cfa digital speedometer ( as reported in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are indeed consistent with a typical k dwarf . as hip 85605",
    "is spectrophotometrically a k dwarf , the _ hipparcos_-derived absolute magnitude ( m@xmath68 @xmath15 11.9 ) _ places the star nearly 5 magnitudes fainter than the main sequence _ ( m@xmath70 @xmath15 7.0 ) for a star of its color - too faint to be simply a metal - poor dwarf , yet too red and luminous for a white dwarf .",
    "hence , most likely hip 85605 is a @xmath0k4v at @xmath22 @xmath15 60 pc and the _ hipparcos _ parallax is erroneous . at @xmath22",
    "@xmath15 60 pc , hip 85605 has a slightly different velocity ( @xmath71 = -10.7 , -14.3 , -11.6 kms@xmath6 ) compared to that used in the simulation by @xcite , and its `` flyby '' of the sun correspondingly moves further into the future and further away ( @xmath02.8 myr in future , @xmath010 pc away ) .",
    "we conclude that hip 85605 is unlikely to penetrate the sun s oort cloud , and that w0720 now appears to have the closest flyby of any known star .",
    "given its current visual magnitude of @xmath13 @xmath15 18.3 @xcite , at its closest approach of @xmath00.25 pc , scholz s star ( w0720 ) would have had an apparent magnitude of @xmath13 @xmath15 10.3 , brighter than the current nearest star ( proxima ; @xmath13 = 11.2 ) but still much dimmer than the faintest naked eye stars ( @xmath13 @xmath0 6 ) .",
    "however , w0720 is an active m dwarf star @xcite , and @xmath13-band flares have been observed to exceed 9 mag on timescales of minutes amongst such stars , and brief flares exceeding 12 mag may be possible @xcite .",
    "flares amongst the coolest m dwarfs have been witnessed with energies of @xmath010@xmath72 ergs @xcite and luminosities of @xmath010@xmath73 - 10@xmath74 ergs@xmath6 .",
    "if w0720 experienced occasional flares similar to those of the active m8 star sdssj022116.84 + 194020.4 @xcite , then the star may have been rarely visible with the naked eye from earth ( @xmath75 ; @xmath76 ) for minutes or hours during the flare events .",
    "hence , while the binary system was too dim to see with the naked eye in its quiescent state during its flyby of the solar system @xmath070 kya , flares by the m9.5 primary may have provided visible short - lived transients visble to our ancestors .",
    "improved astrometry for w0720 via ground - based telescopes @xcite or _ gaia _",
    "@xcite , and further radial velocity monitoring , should help reduce the uncertainties in the flyby timing and minimum separation between scholz s star and the solar system .",
    "past systematic searches for stars with close flybys to the solar system have been understandably focused on the _ hipparcos _ astrometric catalog @xcite , however it contains relatively few m dwarfs relative to their cosmic abundance .",
    "searches in the _ gaia _ astrometric catalog for nearby m dwarfs with small proper motions and large parallaxes ( i.e. with small tangential velocities ) will likely yield addition candidates .",
