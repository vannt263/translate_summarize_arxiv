    "the strong sensitivity of certain quantum states to small variations of external parameters opens up great opportunities for devising high - precision measurements , e.g. of length and time , with unprecedented accuracy .",
    "a particularly important physical measurement technique is interferometry .",
    "its numerous variations include ramsey spectroscopy in atomic physics , optical interferometry in gravitational wave detectors , laser gyroscopes and optical imaging to name but a few .",
    "understanding limits on its performance in realistic situations under given resources is therefore of fundamental importance to metrology . in this paper",
    "we examine the fundamental limits of the precision of optical interferometry in the presence of photon losses for quantum states of light with definite photon number .",
    "optical interferometry aims to estimate the relative phase of two modes , or two `` arms '' , of the interferometer .",
    "this estimation process requires a certain amount of resources which is typically identified to be the number of photons , @xmath0 , used for the measurement . the best precision which can be obtained using classical states of light scales like @xmath1 , the so - called standard quantum limit ( sql ) . using non - classical states of light this precision",
    "can be greatly improved , ideally leading to heisenberg - limited scaling , @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "indeed , recent years have seen many experimental proof - of - principle demonstrations of beating the sql using quantum strategies in various interferometric setups  @xcite . unfortunately , highly non - classical states of light which potentially lead to heisenberg - limited sensitivity are very fragile with respect to unwanted but unavoidable noise in experiments . in quantum - enhanced optical interferometry ,",
    "the loss of photons is the most common and potentially the most devastating type of noise that one encounters .",
    "in particular it was noted that highly entangled quantum states , optimal for interferometry in the lossless case ",
    "n00n states @xcite  are extremely fragile . even for moderate losses",
    "they are outperformed by purely classical states  @xcite .",
    "a different approach has been taken in @xcite , where the noise arising from imperfect preparation of a state has been investigated .    in  @xcite ,",
    "the first systematic approach was taken in order to determine the structure of optical states optimal for interferometry in the presence of losses .",
    "the best possible precision using input states with definite photon number was given .",
    "in this paper we elaborate and extend the ideas presented in  @xcite .",
    "our treatment is based on general quantum measurement theory  @xcite .",
    "the quantity of interest is the lowest possible uncertainty attainable in parameter estimation , inversely proportional to the square root of the quantum fisher information  @xcite .",
    "the quantum fisher information depends only on the state of the system and not on the measurement procedure .",
    "we show that the optimization of the quantum fisher information can be done effectively over the class of input states which have a definite photon number .",
    "since these input states are subject to unavoidable photon losses they will degrade into mixed states and their suitability for phase estimation is compromised .",
    "our optimization takes this into account yielding the most suitable input states in the presence of photon losses leading to the highest possible quantum fisher information , and hence to the best possible precision .",
    "we give a detailed description of the noise model and calculate an analytic expression for the quantum fisher information .",
    "the latter is shown to be a concave function on a convex set and therefore suited for efficient convex optimization methods .",
    "we numerically determine the optimal input states , compare them to alternative quantum and classical strategies , and show that they can beat the sql .",
    "we note that the corresponding precision , which lies between the sql and the heisenberg limit ( depending on the loss rates ) , defines the best possible precision for optical two - mode interferometry .",
    "in addition to this we discuss a measurement procedure that allows one to achieve the optimal precision , in terms of a positive operator - valued measure ( povm ) , and the possibility of using states with indefinite photon number or distinguishable photons .",
    "we show that neither of these generalizations improves the estimation precision , and consequently the state with definite photon number and indistinguishable photons are optimal .",

    "a significant advantage of the local approach over the global one is that for a natural choice of a quadratic cost function , there exist explicit lower bounds on @xmath21 based on the fisher information ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : fisher ] ) . in many practical situations",
    "these bounds are tight and the optimization over the measurement and the estimator can be avoided",
    ". moreover , the local approach may also be useful in situations when there is no a priori knowledge on the phase @xmath3 .",
    "if many copies of a state are given , one can first perform a rough measurement ( even not optimal ) on a small fraction of copies in order to narrow down the range of potential values of @xmath3 so that they lie in a vicinity of a known phase @xmath17 , and then perform the optimal estimation using the local approach .",
    "this strategy will yield a high accuracy estimation for the global approach , without the need of optimizing the measurement and the estimator , since the rough measurement performed on small fraction of copies , even if not optimal , will not significantly influence the final accuracy @xcite .",

    "subsequently , we perform the measurement saturating the cramr - rao bound on pure states ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : fisher ] ) , i.e. a projection on a basis containing the vectors @xmath220 where @xmath221 , @xmath222 are the mean photon number and the variance of the photon number in mode @xmath7 for the state @xmath219 .",

    "states of the form @xmath223 , allow for a @xmath3-independent povm , whereas states with unbalanced weights of @xmath224 , and @xmath225 terms lead to optimal povms which are necessarily @xmath3-dependent .",
    "moreover , for an @xmath0 photon state @xmath226 , a single , @xmath3-independent povm saturating the cramr - rao bound can be found provided that the state enjoys the path - symmetry property : @xmath227 , where @xmath228 is a fixed phase the same for all components @xcite . in general , due to losses the conditional pure states that appear in our problem lack the above mentioned symmetry and consequently the optimal povm varies with the change of @xmath3 .",
    "one could argue that the @xmath0 photon state given by eq .",

    "definite _ photon number @xmath0 , one could consider a state which is a superposition of terms with different total photon number , and only imply a constraint that the _ mean _ photon number is @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , by using states of the form  ( [ eq : input ] ) it is assumed that all photons in an arm of the interferometer are indistinguishable , i.e. occupy a common spatio - temporal mode .",
    "this greatly limits the class of considered states since the hilbert space dimension of states sent into the interferometer would be of the order @xmath229 if the photons were distinguishable , while for indistinguishable photons it is @xmath230 . in the next two subsections",
    "we show that none of these generalizations improves the phase estimation precision , and consequently it is sufficient to consider the states of the form given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : input ] ) .",
    "we emphasize that in this paper we consider closed systems , i.e.  there are no additional reference beams , neither classical nor quantum , since any additional beam would contain photons and should therefore be explicitly taken into account for the determination of the required resources .",
    "consider a superposition of input states of the interferometer with different , but definite photon numbers @xmath165 , @xmath231 where the mean total photon number is @xmath232 , i.e. terms with different @xmath165 evolve with different frequencies . in the absence of an additional reference beam which allows for clock synchronization between the sender and the receiver the relative phases between terms with different @xmath165 become unobservable and the state given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : superpos ] ) is physically equivalent to a mixture @xcite , @xmath233 moreover , since the quantum fisher information is convex ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : fisher ] ) , we have @xmath234 consequently it is always better to send a state with a fixed number of photons @xmath235 , with probability @xmath236 , rather than to use a superposition ( which is effectively a mixture ) .",
    "the analysis can thus be restricted to states with definite photon number without compromising optimality .      in this subsection",
    "we consider general @xmath0 photon input states where the photons are distinguishable which is the case , e.g. , if they are sent in different time bins .",
    "a state of this type can be written as @xmath237 where @xmath238 represents a binary sequence of length @xmath0 , and @xmath239 , @xmath240 .",
    "summation from a sequence to a sequence should be understood using partial ordering between sequences , i.e. @xmath241 . therefore the summation is performed over all binary sequences .",
    "furthermore @xmath242 denotes a state of @xmath0 photons , where @xmath243 means that the photon sent in the @xmath11-th time bin propagates in arm @xmath7 ( @xmath4 ) of the interferometer .",
    "mathematically , we deal here with an arbitrary @xmath0-qubit state , which lives in a @xmath229 dimensional space . notice , that the indistinguishable case is recovered once we consider only the fully symmetric ( bosonic ) subspace of @xmath0 qubits .",

    "let us now symmetrize the state of @xmath0 photons .",
    "this corresponds to replacing @xmath250 with @xmath251 , where the summation is performed over all permutations of an @xmath0 element set .",

    "performing symmetrization corresponds to replacing @xmath255 and @xmath256 with @xmath257 and @xmath258 respectively .",

    "this proves that the optimal states are symmetric states living in the bosonic subspace .",
    "consequently , using indistinguishable photons is sufficient to obtain the optimal fisher information .",
    "a physical intuition behind the above derivation is the following .",
    "notice that if there are no losses , the optimal @xmath0 qubit state has the form @xmath260  it is the n00n state which lives in the fully symmetric subspace . in this case",
    "there is no advantage in using distinguishable photons .",
    "if there are losses , things get even worse for distinguishable photons .",
    "there is still no advantage in terms of phase sensitivity , yet when a photon is lost , the _ knowledge of which photon was lost _ additionally harms the quantum superposition .",
    "hence , it is optimal to use states from a fully symmetric subspace , where it is not possible to tell which photon was actually lost .",
    "we have analyzed the optimal way of using @xmath0-photon states for phase interferometry in the presence of losses .",
    "we have derived an explicit formula for the quantum fisher information in the case when losses are present in one arm of the interferometer , and have provided a useful bound for the case of losses in both arms . using the quantum fisher information as a figure of merit , we have found the optimal states , investigated their advantage over various quantum and classical strategies .",
    "the optimal measurement saturating the cramr - rao bound has been presented , and it has been proven that in general it varies depending on the phase in the vicinity of which we perform estimation .",
    "a close inspection of the properties of the quantum fisher information showed that it is optimal to use a quantum state with a definite number of indistinguishable photons .",
