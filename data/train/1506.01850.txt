    "the supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most attractive theories beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "therefore , the susy has been expected to be observed at the lhc experiments .",
    "however , no signals of the susy have been discovered yet .",
    "the present searches for the susy particles give us important constraints for the susy .",
    "since the lower bounds of the superparticle masses increase gradually , the squark and the gluino masses are supposed to be at the higher scale than @xmath15 tev  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the susy model has been seriously constrained by the higgs discovery , in which the higgs mass is @xmath16 gev  @xcite .",
    "based on this theoretical and experimental situations , we consider the high - scale susy models , which have been widely discussed with a lot of attention @xcite-@xcite .    if the squark and slepton masses are at the high - scale @xmath17-@xmath18 tev , the lightest higgs mass can be pushed up to @xmath16 gev , whereas susy particles are out of the reach of the lhc experiment .",
    "therefore , the indirect search of the susy particles becomes important in the low energy flavor physics @xcite .",
    "the flavor physics is also on the new stage in the light of lhcb data .",
    "the lhcb collaboration has reported new data of the cp violation of the @xmath3 meson and the branching ratios of rare @xmath3 decays  @xcite-@xcite . for many years",
    "the cp violation in the @xmath19 and @xmath2 mesons has been successfully understood within the framework of the standard model ( sm ) , so called kobayashi - maskawa ( km ) model @xcite , where the source of the cp violation is the km phase in the quark sector with three families .",
    "however , the new physics has been expected to be indirectly discovered in the precise data of @xmath2 and @xmath3 meson decays at the lhcb experiment and the further coming experiment , belle - ii .",
    "there are new sources of the cp violation if the sm is extended to the susy models .",
    "the soft squark mass matrices contain the cp violating phases , which contribute to the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) with the cp violation @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can expect the susy effect in the cp violating phenomena .",
    "however , the clear deviation from the sm prediction has not been observed yet in the lhcb experiment  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "actually , we have found that the cp violation of @xmath2 and @xmath3 meson systems are suppressed if the susy scale is above @xmath0 tev @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the ckmfitter group presented the current limits on new physics contributions of @xmath10 in @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 systems @xcite .",
    "they have also estimated the sensitivity to new physics in @xmath2 and @xmath3 mixing achievable with @xmath20 of belle - ii and @xmath21 of lhcb data .",
    "therefore , we should carefully study the sensitivity of the high - scale susy to the hadronic fcnc .    in this work",
    ", we discuss the high - scale susy contribution to the @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 meson systems .",
    "furthermore , we also discuss the sensitivity to the @xmath5 meson and the electric dipole moment ( edm ) of the neutron and the mercury . for these modes ,",
    "the most important process of the susy contribution is the gluino - squark mediated flavor changing process @xcite- @xcite .",
    "the cp violation of @xmath19 meson , @xmath6 , provides a severe constraint to the gluino - squark mediated fcnc @xcite .",
    "in addition , the recent work have found that the chromo - electric dipole moment ( cedm ) is sensitive to the high - scale susy @xcite .",
    "it is noted that the upper - bound of the neutron edm ( nedm ) @xcite gives a severe constraint for the gluino - squark interaction through the cedm @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it is also remarked that the upper bound of the mercury edm ( hgedm ) @xcite can give an important constraint @xcite .    in order to estimate the gluino - squark mediated fcnc of the @xmath19 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath5 mesons",
    ", we work in the basis of the squark mass eigenstate with the non - minimal squark ( slepton ) flavor mixing .",
    "there are three reasons why the susy contribution to the fcnc considerably depends on the squark mass spectrum .",
    "the first one is that the gim mechanism works in the squark flavor mixing , and the second one is that the loop functions depend on the mass ratio of squark and gluino .",
    "the last one is that we need the mixing angle between the left - handed sbottom and right - handed sbottom , which dominates the @xmath22 decay processes .",
    "therefore , we discuss the squark mass spectrum , which is consistent with the recent higgs discovery . taking the universal soft parameters at the susy breaking scale , we obtain the squark mass spectrum at the matching scale where the sm emerges , by using the renormalization group equations ( rges ) of the soft masses . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath23 mixing matrix between squarks and quarks is taken to be free at the low energy .    in section 2",
    ", we discuss the squark and gluino mass spectrum and the squark mixing . in section 3",
    ", we present the formulation of the fcnc with @xmath24 in @xmath19 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath5 meson systems together with nedm and hgedm .",

    "section 5 is devoted to the summary .",
    "the relevant formulations are presented in appendices a , b , c and d.",
    "the low energy fcncs depend significantly on the spectrum of the susy particles , which depend on the model .",
    "as well known , the lightest higgs mass can be pushed up to @xmath16 gev if the squark masses are expected to be @xmath25 tev .",
    "therefore , let us consider the heavy susy particle mass spectrum in the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , which is consistent with the observed higgs mass .",
    "the discussion how to obtain the susy spectrum have been given in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we outline how to obtain the susy spectrum in our work .",
    "the details are presented in appendix a. at the susy breaking scale @xmath26 , we write the quadratic terms in the mssm potential as @xmath27 then , the higgs mass parameter @xmath28 is expressed in terms of @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 as : @xmath32 after running down to the @xmath33 scale , in which the sm emerges , by the one - loop susy renormalization group equations ( rges ) @xcite , the scalar potential is the sm one as follows : @xmath34 here , the higgs coupling @xmath35 is given in terms of the susy parameters at the leading order as @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the top yukawa coupling of the sm .",
    "the parameters @xmath38 and @xmath35 run with the two - loop sm rges with @xmath39 scheme @xcite down to the electroweak scale @xmath40 , and then give @xmath41    when @xmath42 gev is put , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are obtained .",
    "this input constrains the susy mass spectrum of the mssm . in our work",
    ", we take the universal soft breaking parameters at the susy breaking scale @xmath26 as follows : @xmath45 by inputting @xmath42 gev and taking the heavy scalar mass @xmath46 ( see appendix a ) , we can obtain the susy spectrum for the fixed @xmath33 and @xmath31 .",
    "the details and numerical results are presented in appendix a.    let us consider the squark flavor mixing . as discussed above , there is no flavor mixing at @xmath26 in the mssm .",
    "however , in order to consider the non - minimal flavor mixing framework , we allow the off diagonal components of the squark mass matrices at the @xmath47 level , which leads to the flavor mixing of order @xmath48 .",
    "we take these flavor mixing angles as free parameters at low energies .",
    "now we consider the @xmath23 squark mass matrix @xmath49 in the super - ckm basis . in order to move the mass eigenstate basis of squark masses , we should diagonalize the mass matrix by rotation matrix @xmath50 as @xmath51 where @xmath50 is the @xmath23 unitary matrix , and we decompose it into the @xmath52 matrices as @xmath53 in the following expressions : @xmath54 where we use abbreviations @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 . here",
    "@xmath59 is the left - right mixing angle between @xmath60 and @xmath61 , which is discussed in appendix a. it is remarked that we take @xmath62 due to the degenerate squark masses of the first and second families as discussed in appendix a.    the gluino - squark - quark interaction is given as @xmath63q_j+\\text{h.c.}~,\\ ] ] where @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 denotes the gluino field , @xmath67 are three left - handed ( i=1,2,3 ) and three right - handed quarks ( i=4,5,6 ) .",
    "this interaction leads to the gluino - squark mediated flavor changing processes with @xmath24 and @xmath68 through the box and penguin diagrams .",
    "the chargino ( neutralino)-squark - quark interaction can be also discussed in the similar way .",
    "in our previous work @xcite , we have probed the high - scale susy , which is at @xmath0-@xmath69 tev scale , in the cp violations of @xmath19 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons .",
    "it is found that @xmath6 is most sensitive to the susy even if the susy scale is at @xmath69 tev .",
    "the susy contributions for the time dependent cp asymmetries of @xmath2 and @xmath3 with @xmath22 are suppresses at the susy scale of @xmath0 tev .",
    "furthermore , the susy contribution for the @xmath70 process is also suppressed since the left - right mixing angle , which induces the chiral enhancement , is very small as discussed in appendix a. therefore , we discuss the neutral meson mixing @xmath71-@xmath72 , which are fcncs with @xmath24 .    in those fcncs , the dominant susy contribution is given through the gluino - squark interaction .",
    "then , the dispersive part of meson mixing @xmath73 are written as @xmath74 where @xmath75 are given by the squark mixing parameters in eq.([mixing ] ) and its explicit formulation is given in appendices b and c.    at first , we discuss the @xmath76 process , that is , the mass differences @xmath77 and @xmath78 , and the cp - violating phases @xmath79 and @xmath80 . in general , the contribution of the new physics ( np ) to the dispersive part @xmath81 is parameterized as @xmath82 where @xmath83 are the np contributions .",
    "the generic fits for @xmath2 and @xmath3 mixing have given the constraints on @xmath84 @xcite , where it is assumed that the np does not significantly affect the sm tree - level charged - current interaction , that is , the absorptive part @xmath85 is dominated by the decay @xmath86 . at present , the np contribution @xmath87 are @xmath0-@xmath88 and @xmath89-@xmath90 depending on @xmath91 for @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "thus , we can expect the sizable np contribution of @xmath92 .",
    "we will discuss whether the high - scale susy can fill in the magnitude of the present np contribution of @xmath92 .",
    "next , we discuss @xmath93 process , @xmath94 and the cp - violating parameter in the @xmath19 meson , @xmath6 . by the similar parametrization in eq.([np ] ) , the allowed region of @xmath95 has been estimated in ref.@xcite .",
    "the np contribution is at least @xmath96 although there is the strong @xmath97 dependence .",
    "therefore , it is important to examine carefully the cp violating parameter @xmath6 , which is given as follows : @xmath98 with @xmath99 being the isospin zero amplitude in @xmath100 decays . here , @xmath101 is the dispersive part of the @xmath4-@xmath102 mixing , and @xmath103 is the mass difference in the neutral @xmath19 meson .",

    "in addition to the above fcnc processes , the neutron edm , @xmath124 arises through the cedm of the quarks , @xmath125 due to the gluino - squark mixing @xcite-@xcite . by using the qcd sum rules ,",

    "we discuss the charm sector , which is a promising field to probe for the new physics beyond the sm .",
    "the @xmath133 mixing is now well established @xcite as follows : @xmath134 where @xmath13 and @xmath135 are the differences of the masses and the decay widths between the mass eigenstates of the @xmath5 meson , respectively , and @xmath136 is the averaged decay width of the @xmath5 meson . since the sm prediction of @xmath13 at the short distance is much suppressed compared with the experimental value due to the bottom quark loop , the susy contribution may be enhanced .",
    "let us estimate the susy contribution of the low energy fcnc .",
    "we calculate the susy mass spectrum at @xmath137 tev and interpolate the each mass of the susy particle in the region of @xmath138-@xmath1 tev .",
    "this approximation is satisfied within @xmath10 .",
