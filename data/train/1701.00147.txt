    "the generally accepted overall scenario for an eruptive solar flare or coronal mass ejection that we adopt here may be described as follows ( _ e.g. _ , , ) . during the pre - eruption phase ,",
    "the magnetic configuration surrounding a solar prominence consists of a highly sheared magnetic structure , which gradually evolves through a series of force - free equilibria until it loses equilibrium or goes unstable and erupts .",
    "the eruption starts slowly and then suddenly increases in speed .",
    "reconnection is driven below the erupting prominence , and the onset of reconnection is probably what allows the sudden increase in speed , since it cuts loose some of the overlying field lines that had previously been holding the prominence down .",
    "( other points of view include the suggestions that : eruptions are driven by lorentz forces in the photosphere @xcite ; reconnection triggers the eruption @xcite ; and that reconnection is not necessary @xcite . )    the magnetic field in and around the prominence may consist of a highly sheared field or , more often , it is in the form of a flux rope ( a twisted magnetic flux tube ) .",
    "the reconnection has the effect of either creating a new flux rope or enhancing the flux and twist of a pre - existing flux rope @xcite , since this is a natural consequence of three - dimensional reconnection @xcite and the erupting prominence is often observed to be much more highly twisted than was evident in its pre - eruptive state ( _ e.g. _ ,  ; ) .",
    "previously , there have been many numerical magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) studies of the build - up to , and initiation and evolution of , flares and cmes ( see _ e.g. _ , ) .",
    "ways of forming a flux rope include flux emergence @xcite , flux cancellation @xcite , quasi - separator or slip - running reconnection @xcite and separator reconnection @xcite .",
    "possible causes of the eruption include magnetic nonequilibrium @xcite , kink instability @xcite , torus instability @xcite or breakout @xcite .",
    "in particular , physical mechanisms for the initiation and evolution of an eruption have been modelled numerically by , , , , and .",
    "also , the heating rate in flare loops produced by reconnection has been predicted @xcite and compared with _ solar dynamics observatory _",
    "observations @xcite .    during the rise phase of a flare , h@xmath1 ribbons form , and during the main phase the ribbons move apart and are joined by a series of hot flare loops , whose location rises as the flare progresses and whose shear becomes smaller @xcite . as a coronal mass ejection ( cme )",
    "propagates away from the sun , it may be observed as an interplanetary coronal mass ejection ( icme ) or magnetic cloud ( mc ) @xcite , whose structure is that of a magnetic flux rope @xcite .",
    "magnetic clouds possess a low plasma beta and a strong magnetic field that rotates in direction .",
    "indeed , it is likely that all icmes and mcs consist of flux ropes @xcite .",
    "initially , such interplanetary flux ropes were modelled as one - dimensional linear force - free fields or uniform - twist fields @xcite , but more recently the observations have instead been compared with two - and - a - half dimensional grad - shafranov models @xcite .",
    "the lengths of such flux tubes have been estimated from measurements of electron travel - times @xcite to be usually between 1 and 2 au @xcite .",
    "several authors have compared the properties of interplanetary flux ropes with those of the erupting flux ropes at the sun . showed that the poloidal flux ( @xmath2 ) in magnetic clouds is roughly equal to the total reconnected flux ( @xmath3 ) at the sun ( @xmath4 ) , which is strongly suggestive that interplanetary flux ropes are formed mainly by reconnection at the sun during the initiation of the cme . also , the axial ( toroidal ) flux ( @xmath5 ) is less than the reconnection flux ( @xmath6 ) . during a cme ,",
    "regions of coronal images darken , a process called  coronal dimming \" @xcite , and such regions are thought to map the feet of the erupting flux rope and the surrounding region , since the erupting / opening process would allow plasma to escape outwards . found that the dimming flux ( @xmath7 ) is roughly equal to the toroidal flux in the mc ( @xmath8 ) ( see also ) .",
    "extended the analysis to more events and suggested a division into two possible types , which needs to be confirmed in future , bearing in mind the many different models that have been proposed ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , for references ) . found in their study that the twist either decreases with distance from the axis or",
    "is fairly small and constant .",
    "half of the interplanetary flux ropes ( mcs ) have a twist that is roughly constant and is small ( 1.53 turns per au ) , whereas the other half have a higher twist ( up to about 5 turns per au ) that is concentrated in the core of the flux rope . when the eruption is associated with a prominence ( or filament ) , the mean twist tends to be lower .",
    "they also found that the sign of magnetic helicity in mcs is consistent with that of the flaring coronal arcade and confirmed that the poloidal flux in mcs is roughly equal to the measured reconnected flux in flares .",
    "one puzzle that we aim to consider in this paper is the cause of these variations in flux - rope twist , in particular what mechanisms could produce high twist in the core of some events but a low uniform twist in others .",
    "another puzzle is an observational one that has been highlighted by and , namely , that the reconnection during a flare or cme often has two distinct phases with different characteristics @xcite , although sometimes the two phases overlap . during the first phase ( the rise phase of an event ) ,",
    "the flare brightening in h@xmath1 , euv and hard x - rays starts at one point on each flare ribbon and the two points spread rapidly in the same direction along the polarity inversion line ( pil ) by what we call here  zipper reconnection \" .",
    "by contrast , during the main phase , the flare ribbons move outwards in a direction normal to the pil , by what we call  main - phase reconnection \" .",
    "the speed of spread along the pil lies between 3 and 200 km s@xmath9 , whereas the speed normal to the pil starts very fast ( at sometimes 100 km s@xmath9 ) and slows down later to as small as 1 km s@xmath9 .",
    "sometimes , rather than being unidirectional , the flare kernel motions are bidirectional in the sense that they may spread out from one point in both directions along the ribbons @xcite .",
    "sometimes shear motion is observed , in the sense that conjugate footpoints move in opposite directions : at the same time , the angle between the footpoints and the polarity inversion line starts out small and increases as the flare progresses and the corresponding flare loops rotate .",
    "this , however , is different from the zipper effect of footpoints moving in the same direction that we are modelling here .",
    "shear motion is usually thought to be associated with the progression of reconnection from low highly sheared fields to high less - sheared fields that we are describing here as main - phase reconnection .",
    "various studies have been made of the spread of reconnection along the pil @xcite .",
    "for example , found half of the events in their sample have a speed of 1040 km s@xmath9 in one direction ( opposite to * * _ j_**@xmath10 ) along the pil , whereas the other half have speeds of 100200 km s@xmath9 that are either bidirectional ( in both directions from the starting point ) or are in the same direction as * * _ j_**@xmath10 .",
    "describe the 1998 bastille day flare , and suggest the standard 2d model that the formation of the flare ribbons is due to relaxation of field lines that have been blown open by an eruption . in our scenario , this only refers to the transverse motion of the ribbons , whereas the formation is associated with the zipping of a new flux rope ( usually around a pre - existing one ) .",
    "several 3d computations of flux rope eruptions followed by reconnection have been described , but none of them , to our knowledge , have focused on the difference in the nature of the reconnection and the motion of chromospheric brightenings during the rise and main phases of the flare .",
    "for example , model the formation and eruption of a twisted flux rope .",
    "they show that the magnetic helicity remains constant and describe reconnection in the main phase .",
    ", , and show how eruption occurs by the kink or torus instability and how the reconnection builds up twist in the flux rope during the main phase .    furthermore , model an active region containing a coronal null and show how multiple eruptions can be driven by the magnetic breakout scenario .",
    "also , , and have proposed that the flipping ( or slipping ) motion , which is a natural feature of 3d reconnection at a null point , separator or quasi - separator , can account for motion of brightenings along ribbons .",
    "this seems an excellent explanation for the shear motions in opposite directions reported in some flares by and , but this is different from the case of zipper motions in the same direction that we are modelling here .",
    "new features we bring here are an explanation for the initial motion of flare brightenings parallel to the pil and a suggestion as to how the structure of the resulting twist in the erupting flux rope arises and is related to the initial configuration and the two reconnection phases .",
    "three explanations have previously been offered to explain the spreading of flare emission along the polarity inversion line . and described observations of hard x - ray sources and suggest that the flare acceleration region is moving along the pil ( with which we agree ) , but they give no description of the nature or consequences of the reconnection",
    ". modelled the topology of a flare with null points in which the hard x - ray sources move along a series of spines by separator reconnection .",
    "finally , , , and considered flares without null points , but modelled the quasi - topology and the reconnection in terms of quasi - separator ( or slipping ) reconnection .",
    "our ideas build on the two latter ideas by using concepts of magnetic helicity conservation to deduce the effect of either separator or quasi - separator reconnection on the buildup of twist in the erupting flux rope .",
    "we deal with separator reconnection , but , if the null points are replaced by weak - field regions , it simply becomes quasi - separator reconnection . in both cases ,",
    "the reconnecting field lines experience flipping motions .",
    "we find that our model shows how zipper reconnection acting on a sheared arcade followed by main - phase reconnection produces a core twist of at most 2@xmath11 inside a region of uniform twist , and this can naturally explain observed cases of low uniform twist .",
    "by contrast , zipper and main phase reconnection acting on a twisted pre - existing flux rope can naturally give rise to erupting flux ropes with high core twist .",
    "section [ sect_2 ] describes the initial state of the model , and section [ sect_3 ] uses concepts of flux and helicity conservation and equipartition proposed in to model elementary reconnection events of two types , namely a  simple zippette \" between a pair of flux tubes in a sheared arcade and a  helical zippette \" when the arcade overlies an initial flux rope .",
    "such helicity - conserving reconnection is also important in tokamaks and for heating multi - threaded coronal loops @xcite .",
    "section [ sect_4 ] presents the model for 3d zipper reconnection , both for an initial sheared arcade and for an initial arcade containing a flux rope , while section [ sect_5 ] discusses the subsequent main - phase reconnection .",
    "our approach is to set up a simple model to predict the twist in an erupting flux rope in terms of the properties of the pre - eruptive state by imposing conservation of magnetic flux and magnetic helicity and equipartition of magnetic helicity . in future , it is hoped this can be applied both to observations and to computational models .",
    "the extra constraint of energy was suggested by and considered briefly by , but needs computational modelling and so is outside the scope of the present paper .",
    "when energy effects are included they may allow the thermodynamic properties to be determined and they also have the potential to provide extra constraints and so rule out some scenarios that are energetically unfavourable .",
    "we consider first a pre - eruptive sheared coronal arcade , the shear of whose field lines decreases as one moves away from the polarity inversion line ( pil ) ( figure [ fig1]a ) .",
    "the length of the arcade is @xmath12 and its width is @xmath13 , while the shear of the arcade as a whole is @xmath14 . we assume , following the standard procedure in the well - established  magnetic charge topology \" approach @xcite , that the magnetic field sources in the photosphere are modelled as a series of discrete sources rather than a continuous distribution . as an example , figure [ fig1]a shows a set of four rows of four sources . if the discrete sources become continuous or are placed below the photosphere rather than on it , many of the null points and separators become weak - field regions and quasi - separators , but the nature of the reconnection is very similar @xcite",
    ".    we suppose that three - dimensional reconnection takes place in two phases . during the rise phase , reconnection starts in general at any point within the innermost field lines and spreads in both directions along the arcade parallel to the pil by zipper reconnection ( section [ sect_4 ] ) . for simplicity , we start by modelling the case where it starts at one end and proceeds in one direction .",
    "the flux that takes part in the zipper reconnection occupies two narrow regions either side of the pil separated by a distance @xmath15 ( figure [ fig1]b ) .    during the main phase of the flare",

    "we consider instead as the initial state in section [ sect_4.2 ] a sheared coronal arcade overlying a flux rope , since this is thought in many cases to be more representative of the pre - eruptive configuration around a prominence that erupts to give the flare or coronal mass ejection .",

    "figure [ fig2]a gives the general directions of the flux tubes linking the sources initially , but , as we shall discuss in the next subsection they are made up of field lines that are curved and not parallel so that they can reconnect .",
    "furthermore , we are assuming here in figure [ fig2]b that @xmath22 lies above @xmath23 , since we are considering a scenario in which long erupting flux ropes are created .",
    "an argument to suggest that this is energetically allowable was presented briefly in .",
    "the process of reconnection converts the initial configuration , designated @xmath32 , to a final configuration ( @xmath21 ) with a flux rope @xmath22 above an underlying arcade loop @xmath23 ( see figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the reconnection process is assumed to conserve helicity , but changes the partitioning between self - helicity and mutual helicity .",
    "the self - helicity of a single flux tube twisted by total angle @xmath33 ( positive for right - handed twist ) is @xmath34 .",
    "the mutual helicity of a particular configuration is proportional to the signed sum of its two interior angles , designated @xmath24 in figure  [ fig2 ] @xcite .",

    "the interior angle for a given footpoint , the angle s vertex , is that subtended by the two footpoints of the other flux tube .",
    "a positive sign is assigned if the footpoints of that tube appear counter - clockwise when proceeding from the source with the same sign as the vertex .",
    "thus , the interior angle of x@xmath17 , designated @xmath35 in figure  [ fig2]a , contributes to the mutual helicity with a negative sign , since going from y@xmath17 to y@xmath18 is a clockwise direction when viewed from x@xmath17 .",
    "all angles are assigned values in the range @xmath36 and the sign discussed above is used when computing the mutual helicity . for the orientations in figure  [ fig2 ]",
    "we find mutual helicities @xmath37 in agreement with similar expressions in , who treated the special case ( @xmath38 ) of a parallelogram .",
    "having accounted for their signs in equation ( [ eq : hmxy ] ) , all angles can be found from the geometry of the figure .",

    "since the quadrilateral @xmath47 retains its orientation for all values of @xmath29 , none of the angles change their sense , and expression ( [ eq : hmxy ] ) remains valid when @xmath31 .",

    "we assume that the reconnection process contributes equal self - helicity to each , an assumption we call  helicity equipartition \" .",
    "this means that @xmath50 .",
    "the conservation of total helicity therefore implies @xmath51 substituting the mutual helicity expressions from equations ( [ eq : hmxy ] ) , we are able to deduce the final twist in terms of the properties of the initial configuration @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the twist contribution due to a change of mutual helicity .    for configurations with the qualitative appearance of figure  [ fig2 ] , @xmath54 is positive .",
    "this reflects the fact that configuration @xmath21 has a single crossing in the negative sense @xcite , which makes its mutual helicity negative [ see equation  ( [ eq : hmxy ] ) ] .",
    "a positive self - helicity , _",
    "i.e. _ ,   right - handed twist , is required to compensate and thereby conserve total helicity .    in the special case",

    "this startling fact is a natural and elegant consequence of conversion ( with equipartition ) of mutual helicity to self - helicity in the special geometry when the footpoints lie on the vertices of a rectangle . in this case , the initial and final mutual helicities of the two tubes become simply from equation ( [ eq : hmxy ] ) @xmath60 whereas the sum of the final self - helicities of the two tubes becomes @xmath61 , so that , when the initial self - helicities vanish ( @xmath62 ) , equation ( [ eqnconshel ] ) implies @xmath63 .",

    "( b ) in a converging sequence , the third reconnection event ( shown in ( c ) ) occurs between two flux ropes ( @xmath130 and @xmath193 ) with twist @xmath133.,width=377 ]    the previous two subsections consider a particular reconnection sequence in which reconnection propagates northward to produce an overlying flux rope linking the southern most positive source ( @xmath111 ) to the northern most negative source ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "this same final connection can be produced by other reconnection sequences , whether there is an initial flux rope present or not .",
    "the mutual helicity of the final configuration is determined by connectivity , so the change in mutual helicity is independent of the sequence that produces it . since total helicity",
    "is conserved , the self - helicity is also independent of the sequence , so it is tempting to conclude that the final state itself is independent of the sequence",
    ". the distribution of self - helicity depends , however , on the sequence owing to our assumption of helicity equipartition .",
    "we therefore find different distributions of twist for different reconnection sequences .",
    "to illustrate this sequence - dependence , consider a second sequence where reconnection propagates southward beginning from two northern - most tubes , @xmath125 and @xmath194 .",
    "this event is identical to the first event in the original sequence , so @xmath133 is the same .",
    "the resulting overlying flux rope ( @xmath193 ) reconnects next with the untwisted tube to its south ( @xmath124 ) , as shown in figure  [ fig9]a .",
    "this event is not identical with the second event from before , since @xmath195 , @xmath196 , @xmath197 , and @xmath198 .",
    "it is an inverted version of that event , and can be transformed into it by swapping @xmath199 and @xmath200 and swapping @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "it is evident from the symmetric form of equation ( [ eq : dphi2 ] ) , that this transformation leaves @xmath201 unchanged .",
    "this means that @xmath160 is the same , and similar reasoning applies to @xmath158 .",
    "we therefore see that southward - propagating reconnection leads to an overlying flux rope and a set of arcade tubes with the same twist as in the northward - propagating case .",
    "these tubes are , however , arranged in the opposite order , with the most - twisted tube ( @xmath202 ) located at the south end rather than the north end as it was before .",
    "the foregoing argument can be applied more generally to any sequence in which a single overlying flux rope reconnects with the neighboring unreconnected tube on either side  north or south . due to symmetry",
    ", @xmath203 is the same regardless of the direction in which the reconnection proceeds .",
    "this is even true for a sequence where northward and southward propagation is interleaved .",
    "the results are not the same , however , if multiple overlying ropes are produced through separate sequences and then merged .",
    "an example of such a case , depicted in figure  [ fig9]b  c , has two flux ropes , each with twist @xmath133 , reconnecting to form the final overlying rope .",
    "that final reconnection event is characterized by @xmath204 and @xmath205 , from which equation ( [ eq : dphi2 ] ) yields @xmath206 which is different from equation ( [ eq : dphi_g2 ] ) for the simple northward case . moreover , since the reconnecting tubes have identical twist , the products have twist @xmath207 .",
    "this is in general greater than the @xmath160 produced by simple northward propagation .",
    "moreover , in order that total helicity is the same in both scenarios , we find the relation @xmath208 this can be rearranged to find @xmath209 , so the final flux rope is more twisted in this merging scenario than it is in the case where a single flux rope is progressively formed .",
    "reconnection sequences producing the opposite sense of connectivity naturally produce flux ropes with the opposite twist .",
    "thus , for example , consider the basic simple zippette process in section [ sect_3.1 ] and suppose for simplicity that @xmath62 , so that equation ( [ eqnconshel ] ) becomes @xmath210 which implies that the twist in the rope due to the change in mutual helicity is @xmath211 thus , @xmath212 is exactly equal to @xmath11 in the special case of a rectangle ( when @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) . for the configuration shown in figure [ fig2 ] ,",
    "the twist is positive since the initial mutual helicity ( @xmath213 ) is positive and the final mutual helicity ( @xmath214 ) of the flux tube @xmath22 lying over the tube @xmath23 is negative .",
    "this may be seen from the right - hand rule in the sense that , if the fingers of the right hand are directed along the overlying magnetic field , then the sign is positive if the underlying magnetic field is in the direction of the thumb .",

    "however , @xmath221 , so the net effect is that @xmath215 is replaced by @xmath222 in equation ( [ eqnphir ] ) , which now implies that @xmath223 and for a rectangle @xmath224 .",

    "the set of twist variables for this reversed case is related to the original by @xmath236 , where the functions @xmath237 are plotted in figure  [ fig7]a .",
    "we next assume that a twisted flux rope ( @xmath77 ) , which is produced ( or enhanced if a flux rope is present initially ) through zipper reconnection of an arcade , erupts . in so doing it pushes the overlying flux ahead of it .",

    ", we may combine the main phase flux rope ( of flux @xmath263 , and twist @xmath264 , say ) and the zipper flux rope ( of flux @xmath265 and twist @xmath99 from equations ( [ eq_fer ] ) and ( [ eq_phier ] ) ) to give a total erupting flux rope of flux @xmath266 and twist @xmath267 , which is determined by the fact that its self - helicity should be the sum of the self- and mutual helicities of the main phase and zipper flux .",
    "the resulting twist has the same form as equation ( [ eq : phier ] ) : @xmath268 thus , the twist depends crucially on the zipper twist and the ratio of the main phase and zipper fluxes , but for a weak zipper twist it is typically one turn .",
    "the simple reconnection scenario described in section [ sect_5.1 ] starting with a sheared arcade results in a flux rope which is roughly uniformly twisted by about one turn surrounding a less twisted core .",
    "this is a result of the main phase reconnection occurring around a core created by the initial zipping reconnection .",
    "the latter has been found to produce no more twist than approximately one turn .    remembering that the interplanetary observations of magnetic clouds @xcite suggest either a flux rope with a constant twist of 1.5 to 3 turns or one with an enhanced core twist of up to 5 turns , we now consider extra effects that may increase the twist above that of our basic cases .",
    "the most natural way is to adopt as our initial state a coronal arcade that overlies a pre - formed flux rope with large twist @xmath178 , as suggested in section [ sect_4.2 ] .",
    "the zipping phase would then be by helical zippettes , which produces a central concentration in @xmath178 , around which there can be many turns .    in section [ sect_4.3 ]",
    "we have also shown how zipper reconnection occurring in several places along the polarity inversion line ( rather than starting at one end ) increases twist above the unidirectional value .",
    "another possibility is to allow each arcade flux tube to possess its own initial internal twist @xmath126 .",
    "this adds a constant to the twist at each generation .",
    "such a pattern is evident in the first two generations , given by equations ( [ eq : phi_1 ] ) and ( [ eq : phi_2 ] ) .",
    "induction using equation ( [ eq : phin ] ) shows that the pattern persists to arbitrary @xmath108 .",
    "any non - vanishing initial twist is thus added to every curve in figure  [ fig7 ] .",
    "if we start initially with a sheared arcade , such addition could twist the reconnected flux rope @xmath22 to an angle significantly above @xmath0 to trigger a kink instability @xcite .",
    "a further possibility during the main phase ( section [ sect_5.1 ] ) considered in detail in the next subsection is to allow extra reconnection along each sheath between the flux tubes that make up the sheath in figure [ fig10 ] .",
    "after the quasi-2d main phase process , two overlying flux tubes ( @xmath246 and @xmath247 ) in figure [ fig10]c could reconnect to produce another underlying arcade tube ( @xmath269 ) and a single overlying flux tube ( @xmath270 ) .",
    "this event consists of flux tubes @xmath19 and @xmath20 each initially wrapped @xmath271 and @xmath272 times around the central tube , @xmath77 . following the previous discussion , the @xmath22 tube wraps @xmath273 times around the erupting rope .",
    "otherwise the sequence is the same as that for converging reconnection illustrated in figure  [ fig9]b  c , so the final arcade loop , and the wrapping tube , are twisted by @xmath274 , as found in section [ sect_4.3 ] .",
    "this produces an erupting flux rope composed of two separate strands .",
    "the inner core is tube @xmath159 produced by the zipper phase , with internal twist @xmath158 .",
    "wrapped about this is a second strand ( @xmath270 ) with internal twist @xmath274 .",
    "we can lump these components into a single erupting flux rope with @xmath275 whose footpoints lie midway between the feet of its components : _",
    "i.e. _ ,  midway between @xmath111 and @xmath261 in the south and midway between @xmath135 and @xmath262 in the north .",
    "the self - helicity of this tube is a sum of the self - helicities and mutual helicity of its constituents @xmath276 after using the footpoints of the composite tube in equation ( [ eq : hmrz ] ) with @xmath277 ~.\\ ] ] the effective twist of the erupting rope is @xmath278    the reconnection of the sheath of flux results , therefore , in an erupting flux rope with roughly the same connectivity and some additional twist .",
    "the sequence we use for illustration moves the flare ribbons outward , with little evident tendency to move northward or southward .    .",
    "eight arcade layers run to @xmath279 , each represented by @xmath119 sources .",
    "the left panel shows the mean twist @xmath280 from equation ( [ eq : phizn ] ) after the @xmath281 arcade layer for arcades with initial twist , @xmath127 ( diamonds ) and @xmath282 ( squares ) .",
    "the right panel shows the distribution of twist , @xmath283 , defined in equation ( [ eq : phif ] ) for the same two cases , as a function of flux @xmath284 or ( top axis ) radius @xmath285 , where @xmath22 is the outer radius.,width=453 ]    the next layer reconnects in a manner exactly like the previous one except that the central flux rope ( @xmath77 ) now has flux @xmath275 .",
    "after the complete reconnection of that second layer the central rope is wrapped three times by an overlying flux rope , twisted by @xmath274 .",
    "the flux of the central rope is raised to @xmath286 , and its self - helicity is increased .",
    "generalizing equation ( [ eq : phiz1 ] ) to the @xmath128 stage of reconnection gives @xmath287 where @xmath288 is the flux of the rope and @xmath280 is its effective twist .",
    "such a requirement can be used to form a recursion relation for the effective twist : @xmath289 where we introduce superscripts to @xmath290 and @xmath291 as a reminder that @xmath248 and @xmath249 decrease with increasing @xmath108 .",
    "the footpoint of the flux rope is now located at @xmath292 so @xmath293 .\\ ] ] expression ( [ eq : phizn ] ) reduces to equation ( [ eq : phiz2 ] ) for the case @xmath294 after defining @xmath295 , as the result of the zipper phase .",
    "it also approaches the limit @xmath296 reflecting the dominant contribution of the wrapping of each flux tube added to the central rope .",
    "figure [ fig12 ] shows the mean twist values @xmath280 for a flux rope with @xmath297 and an arcade spanning @xmath298 .",
    "the values are found by iterating equation ( [ eq : phizn ] ) for @xmath299 .",
    "the flux rope that ultimately erupts is built up by a sequence of reconnection phases , described above , which add both flux and magnetic helicity .",
    "we designate the accumulated flux by @xmath300 and the effective twist within the central portion of flux @xmath284 by @xmath301 , which satisfies approximately the differential equation @xmath302 for an axisymmetric flux tube with twist density @xmath283 , the mean twist within the central flux @xmath284 is the weighted average @xcite @xmath303 inverting this and using equation ( [ eq : phi_bar ] ) yields the twist density @xmath304 \\nonumber \\\\    & = & 6\\pi ~+~2\\theta_r(f)~+~ { f\\over 2f}\\bigl[\\ , \\bm\\bar{\\phi}(f)+\\phi_{2'}(f ) - 12\\pi - 4\\theta_r(f)\\,\\bigr ] ~.      \\label{eq : phif}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the result , plotted in the right panel of figure  [ fig12 ] , is close to a uniform twist of @xmath305 , due to the wrapping of flux from reconnecting the overlying layers .",
    "a very small central core produced by the zipper phase is less twisted .    .",
    "the configuration is the same as in figure [ fig12 ] , and the dashed curve , labeled `` zipper '' , repeats the case @xmath127 from that plot.,width=453 ]    the above scenario produces a flux rope which is roughly uniformly twisted surrounding a less twisted core .",
    "a highly twisted core is instead produced if the initial state includes a pre - formed flux rope with large twist @xmath178 .",
    "this assumes the role of flux rope @xmath77 in figure  [ fig5 ] , and the main phase reconnection is of the form described in section  [ sect_4.2 ] .",
    "the entire process follows equation ( [ eq : phizn ] ) , with @xmath306 .",
    "figure [ fig13 ] shows the result when the initial flux rope has @xmath307 .",
    "this produces a central concentration in @xmath283 , around which is relatively uniform twist closely matching the previous case ( see dashed curve ) .",
    "several obvious modifications are possible to this scenario or to the earlier zipper case .",
    "the number of elements ( @xmath109 ) in the outer layers may be increased .",
    "we have seen in the previous section that increasing @xmath109 makes only a modest change to the flux rope produced by the zipper phase : @xmath308 generally approaches @xmath0 as @xmath109 increases .",
    "it has a significant effect on the main phase , since it results in a flux rope wrapping @xmath134 times around the core .",
    "the factor @xmath309 is therefore replaced by @xmath310 in equation ( [ eq : phizn ] ) .",
    "more generally , the partitioning of layers could vary with distance , in which case the factor would be @xmath311 , and the profile would become less uniform and approaches @xmath312 , instead of equation ( [ eq : phi_lim ] ) . with this parametric freedom it appears possible to produce twist profiles with a wide variety of forms .",
    "one of the key features of flares is that they start at some point along a polarity inversion line and then spread during the rise phase in a direction along it .",
    "later , during the main phase the flare spreads outwards in a direction normal to the inversion line .",
    "another feature is that , when a flux rope that has originated in an erupting flare or a coronal mass ejection is observed in interplanetary space , it can have either a relatively uniform twist profile or a highly twisted core surrounded by a region where the twist is much more uniform .",
    "we present a simple model to try and explain these observations by adopting three assumptions , namely , conservation of magnetic flux and magnetic helicity and equipartition of magnetic helicity , which allow us to compare the pre - flare and flaring situation .",
    "we suggest that , during the phase of so - called 3d  zipper reconnection \" , reconnection spreads along the arcade away from the initiation site , and in so doing creates a twisted flux rope .",
    "this either acts as the core for the erupting flux rope if the initial state is a sheared arcade , or it wraps around a twisted flux rope that is present in the pre - flare state . in the former case a twisted flux rope is created with a moderate twist of typically only one turn . in the latter case",
    "when a preflare flux rope is present , a much more highly twisted core can be produced with a typical twist of @xmath186 namely , roughly @xmath187 turns . here",
    "@xmath313 where @xmath189 is the magnetic flux of the new flux rope ( @xmath111 in figure [ fig8 ] ) and @xmath190 is the magnetic flux in one of the flare ribbons when it is first fully formed ( @xmath191 in figure [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "hence the greater the number of times that the new flux rope reconnects with the magnetic flux of the initial flare ribbons as it zippers its way along the polarity inversion line , the larger the number of turns produced .",
    "the initial phase of a two - ribbon flare is clearly not produced by 2d reconnection , since the flare ribbons do not form instantaneously .",
    "rather , the energy release is observed to be inhomogeneous and to fragment along the pil : it starts at one location and then spreads along the pil by what we term zipper reconnection .",
    "thus , the magnetic flux is quantized , in the sense that only one part of the flux reconnects initially .",
    "we suggest that this initial quantum of flux then reconnects again with another quantum located further along the pil and so the process continues in a zipper - like manner and forms the whole flare ribbon .",
    "the cause of this quantization may be that the initial resistive instability involves just one part of the whole configuration or is focused in one part with a certain quantum of flux ; or perhaps in some events the photospheric flux itself is concentrated rather than being spread uniformly along the pil . as we have seen",
    "the size of the quantum is important , since the resulting twist created by zipper reconnection is proportional to the ratio of the total flux to the quantum ( see equation ( [ number turns ] ) ) .",
    "we have chosen to model the zipper process most simply by assuming the magnetic flux itself is fragmented in a series of flux sources located along the pil ( @xmath314 , figure [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "it may be possible in future to simulate the process with an initial field that is not fragmented , but in which the magnetic reconnection begins at one location ( as observed ) rather than beginning simultaneously all along the pil ( as in a purely 2d model ) .",
    "after the zipper phase , quasi-2d  main phase reconnection \" causes the reconnection to spread in a direction normal to the polarity inversion line , enhancing the flux rope with a twist that is uniform along the rope but varies with radius .",
    "it also creates an arcade of rising flare loops and separating chromospheric ribbons .",
    "our simple model shows how the mean twist in the flux rope depends on the various geometrical properties of the pre - flare configuration , and we are also able to deduce the variation with flux of the internal twist inside the flux rope .",
    "the new aspects are : a deduction of the amount of twist in the erupting flux rope from the initial geometry and the nature of the reconnection ; the suggestion that the initial zipper phase of reconnection during the establishment of the flare loops and flare ribbons can build up strong core twist in the erupting flux rope ; and a new relation between the resulting core twist and the ratio of the fluxes in the ribbons and the new part of the flux rope .",
    "interplanetary flux ropes of uniform twist could be produced either from an initial sheared arcade ( provided it becomes eruptively unstable ) or from an arcade containing an initial flux rope of moderate twist ( up to one or two turns , which is more likely to become unstable ) .",
    "interplanetary ropes of high twist , on the other hand , could be produced if the initial flux rope has high twist ( in excess of two turns ) or an active zipper phase creates many new turns around the initial flux rope . in future , to help predict radial twist profiles in magnetic clouds , it would be useful to measure the preflare geometry and dimensions of the flare region , the twist in an initial flux rope before eruption , and the magnetic fluxes in the initial ribbons and the new initial flux rope as well as the total flux mapped out by the ribbons in their transverse motion .",
    "other important aspects to study include : determining whether the assumption of magnetic helicity equipartition is a good one or needs to be modified ; comparing the model with observations and computational experiments , and making it more realistic ; including the extra constraints from energy considerations ; deducing the twist in an initial flux rope from observations ; and determining the flux of the zipper flux rope by comparison with that of the overlying arcade and its effect on the erupting flux rope .",
    "the twist produced by the first zippette from two initially untwisted flux tubes is , from equation ( [ eq : dphi_g1 ] ) , @xmath315 where , when there is no shear initially ( _ i.e. _ , when @xmath316 ) , we know that @xmath317 .      first of all , note that @xmath322 ( and so @xmath317 ) at @xmath316 and as @xmath323 tends to @xmath324 . also , @xmath284 is an odd function of @xmath323 , so that @xmath325 is an antisymmetric function of @xmath323 . for values of @xmath326 for which @xmath327 ( namely , @xmath328 , as we shall prove below ) , @xmath329 when @xmath330 so that @xmath331 , whereas @xmath332 when @xmath333 so that @xmath334 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath335 dips below @xmath74 ( which occurs when @xmath336 ) , then there is a range of @xmath323 for which @xmath337 for @xmath330 and @xmath338 for @xmath333 .    in order to establish these facts and sketch the curves ,",
    "consider first @xmath339 , which is an even function of @xmath323 , so we focus on its behaviour when @xmath340 . at @xmath316 , @xmath341 , which is always positive ( since @xmath342 ) and increases with @xmath326 , as indicated by the variation in the position of the large dot in the top row of figure [ fig14 ] .",
    "also , @xmath335 is positive when @xmath343 but vanishes when @xmath336 at two positive values and two negative values given by @xmath344 the two positive values coincide at @xmath345 when @xmath346 .    turning points of @xmath335 as a function of @xmath323 for fixed @xmath326",
    "are given by @xmath347 thus , when @xmath348 there is only one turning point ( a minimum ) at @xmath316 .",
    "however , when @xmath349 two more turning points appear at @xmath350 which increases in magnitude with @xmath326 .",
    "the value of @xmath335 at these two new turning points is @xmath351 which represent minima , since there is only one turning point in the range @xmath330 , @xmath352 and @xmath353 as @xmath354 .",
    "thus , when @xmath349 , the turning point at the origin becomes a maximum .",
    "the minimum value @xmath355 is positive when @xmath356 but is negative when @xmath336 , namely , when the four extra zeros of @xmath335 appear .",
    "putting together this information , we arrive at the qualitative behaviour of @xmath335 for different ranges of @xmath326 shown in the top row of figure [ fig14 ] .     and the flux rope twist @xmath357 after one zippette as functions of @xmath323 for : ( a ) @xmath358 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath359 ; ( b ) @xmath356 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath360 ) ; and ( c ) @xmath336 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath361 ) , where @xmath362 , @xmath363 is the ratio of the arcade shear to its width in figure [ fig6 ] , and @xmath364 is the ratio of the arcade length to its width.,width=453 ]    next , consider @xmath365 and the corresponding form for the twist @xmath133 .",
    "first of all , note that @xmath284 vanishes only at @xmath316 and as @xmath366 and its gradient @xmath367 at the origin is @xmath368 , which is always negative and decreases in magnitude as @xmath326 increases .    for @xmath328 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath65 ) , @xmath369 and",
    "so @xmath284 is finite .",
    "it is negative when @xmath323 is positive and positive when @xmath323 is negative , so that @xmath370 ( see the bottom row of figure [ fig14]a and b ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath320 as a function of @xmath323 possesses a turning point where @xmath371 vanishes , namely , at @xmath372 the value ( @xmath373 ) at @xmath374 is @xmath375 which is positive when @xmath336 and negative when @xmath328 .    when @xmath336 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath376 ) , in the region where @xmath330 there are two locations where @xmath284 becomes infinite , and between them @xmath284 becomes positive and possesses a minimum .",
