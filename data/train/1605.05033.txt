    "in nuclei towards neutron - drip - line a systematic change of neutron - shell - structure from the one well - known around the fermi level of stable nuclei has been discussed both theoretically and experimentally , especially in connection with recent experimental data which have been obtained by using radioactive ion beams .",
    "the possible disappearance of neutron magic numbers n=8 or 20 or 28 is an example .",
    "the systematic change can come from the fact that weakly - bound neutron orbits with larger orbital angular - momenta @xmath10 are sensitive to the strength of the potential , while those with smaller @xmath10 are much less sensitive .",
    "this is because when eigen energies of bound one - neutron orbits approach zero , due to the strong @xmath10-dependence of the centrifugal potential the major part of the wave functions of orbits with smaller @xmath10 ( thus , smaller @xmath11 ) lies outside the potential provided by well - bound core - nucleons , while that of orbits with larger @xmath10 ( thus , larger @xmath11 ) stays inside the potential .",
    "consequently , for example , the energy of the weakly - bound @xmath12-shell approaches that of the weakly - bound @xmath13-shell .",
    "namely , the magic number n=28 known around the fermi level of stable nuclei disappears .",
    "corresponding change of the shell - structure can be seen also in deformed nuclei , though the characteristic behavior of orbits with smaller @xmath10 becomes somewhat vague because the wave functions of one - particle orbits in deformed potentials , in general , contain various @xmath10 components .",
    "an exceptionally unique case is neutron one - particle orbits with @xmath5 = 1/2@xmath8 , where @xmath14 expresses the component of one - particle angular - momentum along the symmetry axis of the axially - symmetric quadrupole - deformed potential . in this case",
    "the @xmath10=0 component becomes dominant in deformed neutron wave - functions in the limit that the eigenenergy @xmath15 @xmath16 approaches zero , irrespective of the nature of orbits , because of the absence of the centrifugal barrier for the @xmath17 channel .",
    "in other words , in the limit the wave functions of one - neutron orbits with @xmath5 = 1/2@xmath8 in the deformed potential become @xmath18 wave - functions .    while in the spherical limit an orbit with @xmath5 = 1/2@xmath8",
    "can be created from every positive - parity orbits such as @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , ... , in deformed nuclei all one - particle orbits with @xmath5 = 1/2@xmath8 acquire @xmath17 components induced by the deformation .",
    "similarly , all one - particle orbits with @xmath5 = 1/2@xmath6 in deformed potentials have some amount of @xmath23 component .    in the case of deformed shape",
    "the component with the smallest orbital angular - momentum @xmath24 in one - particle wave - functions plays a crucial role in the behavior of both weakly - bound and resonant one - particle orbits .",
    "both the presence or absence of one - particle resonance and the decay width can be determined decisively by the value of @xmath24 , which is defined as the smallest orbital angular - momentum among orbital angular - momenta of components in the wave function , and the magnitude of the @xmath10 = @xmath24 component in the wave function .",
    "it should be also noted that among an infinite number of positive - energy one - particle levels one - particle resonant levels are most important in many - particle correlations of bound nuclei .",
    "@xcite for the characteristic feature of one - particle orbits unique in deformed potentials .",
    "the above - mentioned shell - structure change has been discussed mostly for one - particle bound states , in connection with available experimental data on nuclei close to but inside the drip line . however , since the component of one - particle wave - functions inside the nuclear potential will contribute to the determination of one - particle resonant energies , it is easily understood that the same kind of shell - structure as observed for weakly - bound neutrons is expected for low - lying neutron resonant levels , as far as the resonances can be well - defined with narrow decay - widths .",
    "some numerical examples can be seen , for example , in fig .",
    "@xcite where the resonant energy ( @xmath25 ) of the neutron @xmath12 orbit is shown to approach that of the neutron @xmath13 orbit in the way similar to the energies of weakly - bound neutrons , or in fig . 3 of ref .",
    "@xcite , which was presented in connection with the presence ( or absence ) of the n=50 magic number for nuclei towards the neutron - drip - line .    from my experience in both stable and drip - line nuclei",
    "i expect that low - lying levels of odd - a deformed nuclei can well be analyzed in terms of one - particle motion in the deformed potential provided by the even - even core .",
    "for example , see the successful quantitative analysis of various kinds of experimental data on odd - a nuclei in ref .",
    "thus , in order to see the shell - structure change in low - lying neutron resonant levels , i would examine odd - n nuclei , of which the neutron fermi level lies slightly above zero .",
    "it is emphasized that the shell - structure of one - particle resonant levels has no chance to be properly studied by conventional shell - model calculations , in which harmonic - oscillator wave - functions are used .    in this respect ,",
    "the nucleus @xmath0mg@xmath1 , which was verified to lie outside the neutron - drip - line @xcite , is very interesting , because the neutron separation energy estimated from systematic trends of atomic mass @xcite is @xmath26130 kev .",
    "thus , it is expected that the lowest resonance of the nucleus lies presumably less than a few hundreds kev outside the drip line , and depending on the angular - momentum it may be observed as a sharp resonance .",
    "even only the energies and widths of low - lying resonances of @xmath7 mg will be sufficient to provide the valuable information on the shell structure of one - particle resonant levels for the possible deformed shape .",
    "if @xmath7 mg is spherical and the shell - structure of neutron resonant levels is similar to something known in stable nuclei , one expects that the lowest resonance should be observed as a very sharp @xmath27 resonance presumably within a few hundreds kev in the continuum .",
    "however , the proton number z=12 is known to prefer prolate deformation as qualitatively understood from the presence of a large energy gap at z=12 on the prolate side of one - proton energy diagrams as a function of quadrupole deformation ( nilsson diagrams ) . for example , see fig . 3 of ref .",
    "@xcite , noting that in light nuclei the shell - structure of protons is nearly the same as that of neutrons in the case of well - bound orbits . thus , unless the neutron number strongly prefers spherical shape , all even - even as well as odd - n neutron - rich mg isotopes were predicted to be prolately deformed @xcite . indeed ,",
    "even - even neutron - rich mg - isotopes with n=22 - 26 towards the neutron drip - line are found to be deformed by observing small values of @xmath28 and possible @xmath29 ratios close to 3 @xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    "the direct two - proton removal from @xmath30si , which is presumably oblately - deformed @xcite , is measured .",
    "the analysis of the inclusive cross - section for the two - proton removal supports for the interpretation of a prolately - deformed ground state of @xmath31 mg @xcite .",
    "the neutron separation energy of @xmath31 mg is estimated to be 1.740 mev from the systematic trends @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in ref .",
    "@xcite measured precise reaction cross sections on c targets have been reported for @xmath32mg@xmath33 , from which deformed shape of mg - isotopes with n=20 - 26 is concluded .",
    "in particular , the measured reaction cross section of @xmath34mg@xmath35 is in good agreement with the interpretation of the @xmath36-wave halo nucleus , which is concluded from the coulomb break - up reaction in ref .",
    "@xcite . from the available experimental information described above",
    "one may expect that @xmath7 mg is prolately deformed and may be detected as a low - energy resonance .",
    "the spin - parity of the lowest resonance of @xmath7 mg will be sensitive to the shell - structure of one - particle resonant levels which will be analogous to that of weakly - bound neutrons .",
    "the case of @xmath7 mg is interesting especially because there may be a chance to perform related experiments in a near future .",
    "i estimate a possible spin - parity of the lowest resonance of @xmath7 mg , which will be identified as one - particle resonance with the energy of a few hundreds kev and a very narrow width .",
    "possible information on the unbound nucleus @xmath2c@xmath3 is of another interests . using the single - proton removal reaction from a beam of @xmath37n@xmath3 , the neutron - unbound nucleus",
    "@xmath9c was searched for in ref .",
    "neutrons were detected in coincidence with @xmath38c fragments , however , no evidence for low - lying states were found . and ,",
    "the reconstructed [ @xmath38c + @xmath39 decay - energy spectrum was reported to be described with an s - wave line shape .",
    "the neutron separation energy of @xmath2c@xmath3 estimated by using the systematic trends of atomic mass @xcite is only @xmath2615 kev .",
    "the application of woods - saxon potentials to light nuclei such as c - isotopes may be somewhat questioned , however , in the present article i examine the shell - structure based on deformed woods - saxon potentials because my aim is mainly to study the one - particle resonant structure of @xmath9c , the core nucleus of which is @xmath38c that may be oblately deformed .    while in sec .",
    "ii the model used and a brief summary of the definition of one - particle resonances in deformed potentials are given , in sec.iii practical examples of light nuclei are given .",
    "in sec . iii.a the @xmath40 shell structure in both bound and resonant one - particle levels , which are calculated by using deformed woods - saxon potentials with standard parameters ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and the application of the idea to neutron - rich mg isotopes , in particular to @xmath7 mg , are presented . in sec",
    "iii.b the @xmath41 shell structure in both weakly - bound and resonant one - particle levels in neutron - rich c - isotopes is described and , in particular , the interesting case of the unbound nucleus @xmath2c@xmath3 , which is expected to be only slightly unbound but has not yet been observed , is presented .",
    "conclusions and discussions are given in sec iv .",
    "since the definition of one - particle resonances in deformed potentials is described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , a brief summary is given in the following . in the present article",
    "axially - symmetric quadrupole deformation is considered in the absence of pair correlation .",
    "writing the single - particle wave - function as @xmath42 which satisfies @xmath43 where @xmath14 expresses the component of one - particle angular momentum along the symmetry axis , which is a good quantum number , and @xmath44 i study one - neutron resonances and use the woods - saxon potentials with standard parameters @xcite for the nuclear one - body potential .",
    "then , the coupled equations for the radial wave - functions are written as @xmath45 where @xmath46 for positive - energy ( @xmath47 ) one - particle levels i solve the coupled equations ( [ eq : cpl ] ) in coordinate space for a given set of potential parameters , requiring @xmath48 and the asymptotic behavior of @xmath49 for @xmath50 as @xmath51 where @xmath52 the quantity @xmath53 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pbc ] ) is called eigenphase",
    ".    solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cpl ] ) satisfying the above boundary conditions can be found for any @xmath47 values , since the problem here is not an eigenvalue problem such as the problem of finding bound states .",
    "it is noted that the eigenphase is common to all components of open channels , ( @xmath54 ) , of a given solution with @xmath14 . for given @xmath15 and potential",
    "one may obtain several solutions for @xmath53 .",
    "the number of solutions is indeed equal to that of wave - function components with different @xmath55 .",
    "one - particle resonance in deformed potentials is obtained , when an eigenphase @xmath53 increases through @xmath56 as @xmath15 increases . in the limit of @xmath57 this definition , of course , agrees with the definition of one - particle resonance in spherical potentials , which can be found in various text books .",
    "when i find one - particle resonant levels thus defined , i calculate the intrinsic width of the resonance using the formula @xmath58 where the denominator is calculated at the resonance energy .",
    "the value of @xmath59 is usually determined decisively by the @xmath24 component of the wave function . in the case of band - head states ,",
    "of which the spin - parity is @xmath4 = @xmath5 with possible exceptions for @xmath14 = 1/2 , it is expected that the width ( @xmath60 ) observed in the laboratory is approximated by the above intrinsic width .",
    "this expectation is based on the following approximate picture : the structure of the band - head state may be generally little affected by rotational perturbation ( namely little coriolis perturbation ) . in order to obtain the band - head state in the laboratory system , which is an eigenstate of angular - momentum , various direction of the deformed intrinsic state must be properly superposed ( a kind of zero - point fluctuation related to rotational motion ) .",
    "now , since the decay by neutron emission will occur in general much faster than slow rotational motion , in the first approximation the process of neutron emission may be treated for a fixed direction of deformation ( or the deformed intrinsic state ) .",
    "that means , the decay - width of neutron emission may be estimated in the intrinsic system .",
    "if so , the width @xmath60 to be observed in the laboratory system is approximated by @xmath59 .",
    "as no one - neutron resonance with @xmath18 is obtained in spherical potentials because of the absence of centrifugal potential for the @xmath17 channel , one - neutron resonance with @xmath5 = 1/2@xmath8 in deformed potentials is rare to be found .",
    "for example , see fig.1 of ref .",
    "however , even for the positive energy of more than several mev the @xmath5 = 1/2@xmath8 one - neutron resonance can be present in the case that the absolutely overwhelming components of the wave function have larger @xmath10 values .",
    "in such cases the one - neutron resonance can exist because of the components with large @xmath10 while the decay width is controlled by the tiny @xmath10 = 0 component . for larger deformations one - neutron wave functions",
    "usually contain an appreciable amount of @xmath18 component .",
    "as soon as the wave function starts to contain an appreciable amount of @xmath18 component , the possible one - neutron resonant state immediately decays via the @xmath18 channel and , then , the related eigenphase may not reach @xmath56 .    similarly , in spherical potentials with parameters appropriate for neutron - rich mg isotopes one - neutron resonance with @xmath23 or @xmath61",
    "may not be obtained at the energy higher than , say about 1 mev , due to the low centrifugal barrier . for larger deformation of those potentials",
    "it is not often to obtain higher - lying one - neutron resonances with @xmath5 = 1/2@xmath6 or 3/2@xmath6 .",
    "only when the overwhelming components of the resonances have larger @xmath10 values , one - neutron resonances with @xmath5 = 1/2@xmath6 or 3/2@xmath6 can survive even for larger positive energies .",
    "in contrast , for example , in the @xmath40-shell nuclei one - neutron resonances with @xmath5 = 5/2@xmath6 or 7/2@xmath6 can be easily obtained up till positive energy of several mev with a meaningful amount of decay width , because the @xmath24 value of the components of the wave functions is 3 , for which a pretty high centrifugal barrier is present .    in the present work",
    "i take the rule that in odd - n nuclei the spin - parity of the band - head state of the low - lying band with @xmath5 is @xmath4 = @xmath5 , where @xmath14 expresses the angular - momentum component of the n - th neutron orbit along the symmetry axis for an appropriate quadrupole deformation , except for the case of @xmath14 = 1/2 . in the case of @xmath14 = 1/2 the decoupling parameter , which is the diagonal element of the particle - rotation coupling that can be calculated by using the one - particle wave - function of the n - th neutron orbit ,",
    "should be taken into account . examining experimental data",
    "there are no exceptions , to my knowledge , to the above rule in the case of well - deformed odd - a nuclei . for typical examples ,",
    "see the analysis of @xmath62mg@xmath63 on p.284 of ref .",
    "@xcite or @xmath64yb@xmath65 on p.259 of ref .",
    "the picture of one - particle motion in deformed potentials works for deformed nuclei indeed much better than that of one - particle motion in spherical potentials for spherical nuclei .",
    "this is mainly because the major part of the ( @xmath66 ) channel of the two - body quadrupole - quadrupole interaction is absorbed into the quadrupole mean - field .",
    "in fig . 1 energies of one - neutron bound- and resonant - levels for the system [ @xmath67mg@xmath68 + one neutron ] are plotted as a function of axially - symmetric quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath69 , while in fig .",
    "2 energies of one - neutron bound - levels for the system [ @xmath70ti@xmath68 + one neutron ] are shown .",
    "the nucleus @xmath0mg@xmath1 is expected to lie outside the neutron - drip - line only by a few hundreds kev , while the nucleus @xmath71ti@xmath1 is a typical stable odd - n @xmath40-shell nucleus , of which the neutron separation energy s(n ) is equal to 8.142 mev , and the observed spin - parity of the ground state is 7/2@xmath6 . in fig . 2",
    "one - neutron resonant energies are not plotted since they are not important for the present discussion .",
    "the parameters of woods - saxon potentials used in figs . 1 and 2 are taken from the set of standard parameters @xcite except for the depth in fig .",
    "1 . the value @xmath72 = @xmath2637.5 mev used in fig . 1 is shallower than the standard value for the proton and neutron numbers of @xmath73 mg by 1.3 mev , but it was chosen so that @xmath7 mg is obtained as one - particle resonant levels at a few hundreds kev .",
    "examining fig .",
    "@xcite , fig . 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite and fig.1 of the present article it is clearly seen that when one - neutron @xmath13 and @xmath12 states become weakly bound or one - particle resonant states they become almost degenerate for spherical shape .",
    "the magic number n=28 disappears and , as a result of it , the nuclei with @xmath74 = 21 - 28 may be deformed if the proton number allows the deformation @xcite .",
    "following the shell - structure change for spherical shape , the shell - structure of @xmath40-shell in deformed shape changes as seen in the comparison between fig . 1 and fig",
    ". 2 . in contrast , using the present woods - saxon potential with the standard parameters the neutron number n=28 is a good magic number , of course , for spherical shape in stable nuclei , as seen in fig .",
    "the ground - state spin - parity of @xmath75mg@xmath76 is known to be 3/2@xmath6 @xcite , but that of neutron - rich mg isotopes with n = 23 and 25 is not yet experimentally pinned down .",
    "studying the level structure of the prolate side of fig . 1",
    "one obtains that the one - particle orbit occupied by the last odd - neutron ( namely the 21st neutron ) of @xmath77 mg is [ 330 1/2 ] , @xmath5 = 1/2@xmath6 for @xmath78 , [ 202 3/2 ] , @xmath5 = 3/2@xmath8 for @xmath79 and",
    "[ 321 3/2 ] , @xmath5 = 3/2@xmath6 for @xmath80 . in the case of the lowest - lying @xmath5 = 1/2@xmath6 orbit in the deformed @xmath40 shell , namely the [ 330 1/2 ] orbit , which may be assigned to the ground - state configuration of @xmath75mg@xmath76 , the spin - parity of the lowest state ( namely , the band - head state ) to be observed is @xmath4 = 3/2@xmath6 due to the decoupling parameter coming from the main components @xmath13 and @xmath12 of the wave - function .",
    "thus , the measured spin - parity @xmath4 = 3/2@xmath6 of the ground state of @xmath77mg@xmath76 can be naturally obtained for either @xmath78 or @xmath80 in fig .",
    "furthermore , the calculated magnetic moment for the band - head state @xmath4 = 3/2@xmath6 from the intrinsic [ 330 1/2 ] state is @xmath260.88 @xmath81 for @xmath69 = 0.25 and that for the band - head state @xmath4 = 3/2@xmath6 from the [ 321 3/2 ] state is @xmath260.40 @xmath81 for @xmath69 = 0.50 , while that for the band - head state @xmath4 = 3/2@xmath8 from the intrinsic [ 202 3/2 ] state is @xmath820.91 @xmath81 for @xmath69 = 0.35 , in comparison with the measured value of @xmath260.7456(5 ) @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "the deformed @xmath36-wave halo nature of the ground state of @xmath83mg@xmath35 observed in @xcite is consistent with the neutron orbit with @xmath5 = 1/2@xmath6 , which is the second - lowest @xmath5 = 1/2@xmath6 orbit on the prolate side of the @xmath40-shell ( see fig .",
    "@xcite . )    from the above consideration , it may be acceptable to assume that the 27th odd neutron in @xmath7mg@xmath1 occupies the orbit with @xmath5 = 5/2@xmath6 , which is denoted by a long - dashed curve in fig .",
    "1 having the positive energy of several hundreds kev . from the present consideration one almost uniquely ends up with @xmath4 = @xmath5 = 5/2@xmath6 for the spin - parity of the lowest resonance of @xmath7 mg , if the nucleus is prolately deformed and the two one - particle levels , @xmath13 and @xmath12 at @xmath84 , are almost degenerate .",
    "furthermore , on the prolate side the calculated one - particle energy of the @xmath5 = 5/2@xmath6 orbit originating from the @xmath13 shell at @xmath69=0 is almost independent of the @xmath69 value .",
    "the almost constant ( intrinsic ) energy of the @xmath5 = 5/2@xmath6 level as a function of @xmath69 seen in fig .",
    "1 does not come from the property of weakly - bound level or low - lying resonant level , but it comes from the fact that the main component of the level is @xmath13 with a small admixture of @xmath85 .",
    "the calculated one - particle decay width of the i@xmath86 = 5/2@xmath6 state is 0.01 mev at @xmath87 for the @xmath13 resonant state at @xmath88 = 0.32 mev , and the width does not considerably change as the system becomes prolately deformed , because the one - particle resonant energy is almost constant and the main component mixed due to the deformation is @xmath85 , which has the same @xmath89 orbital angular - momentum as that of @xmath13 .",
    "for example , the calculated intrinsic width @xmath59 ( @xmath90 ) is 0.02 mev at @xmath69=0.4 for the resonant @xmath5 = 5/2@xmath6 state at @xmath88 = 0.62 mev . if the positive energy of the lowest resonance of @xmath7 mg deviates considerably from several hundreds kev , the width will be accordingly different .    by the way , in the present example of @xmath7 mg the one - particle orbit closest to the n = 27th @xmath5 = 5/2@xmath6 orbit on the prolate side is the @xmath5 = 1/2@xmath6 orbit ,",
    "the energy of which is denoted by a solid curve in fig .",
    "the particle - rotation coupling between the two states having the particle orbits with @xmath5 = 5/2@xmath6 and @xmath5 = 1/2@xmath6 is expected to be pretty weak because of @xmath91 = 2 .      the neutron - rich c - isotopes , in particular the nucleus @xmath2c@xmath3 lying slightly outside the neutron - drip - line , are another interesting examples in the sense different from mg - isotopes .",

    "one may compare fig .",
    "3 with fig . 1 of ref . @xcite , which is drawn for the [ @xmath113c@xmath114 + one neutron ] system where the standard parameters for the proton and neutron numbers of @xmath94c are used also for the value of @xmath72 .",
    "it is pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that the particle - numbers 6 and 14 are magic numbers in the deformed harmonic - oscillator ( ho ) potential with the oblate deformations ( @xmath115 ) = ( 1:2 ) and ( 2:3 ) .",
    "moreover , also for woods - saxon potentials with standard parameters large energy gaps are obtained at the particle numbers 6 and 14 for @xmath116 .",
    "see fig.2 of ref .",
    "that means , the nucleus @xmath38c has a very good chance of being oblately deformed , while only a few even - even nuclei are known to be oblate in the region of lighter nuclei with @xmath117 .    from fig .",
    "3 it is seen that on the oblate side the 15th neutron of @xmath9c will occupy the @xmath5 = 1/2@xmath8 orbit , the lowest state of which is @xmath4 = 1/2@xmath8 . the state can not be obtained as a one - particle resonant state for @xmath118 , namely , the state has a very large width and can be hardly identified as a state .    in short , from the present consideration it is very likely that the unbound nucleus @xmath9c is not observed as a resonant state though the possible lowest resonance may be expected to be only slightly outside the neutron - drip - line .",
    "this result , in particular , the oblate shape of @xmath9c , thereby the spin - parity @xmath4 = @xmath5 = 1/2@xmath8 for the lowest state , is in good agreement with the observed fact @xcite that no evidence for a low - lying state has been yet found .",

    "@xcite is consistent with the spin - parity @xmath4 = 1/2@xmath8 coming from the interpretation that the 15th neutron is placed on the @xmath119 orbit in the continuum assuming spherical shape , i want to point out that @xmath9c is likely to be oblately deformed and  no evidence  is consistent also with the oblate shape .",
    "i have shown that the spin - parity of the lowest resonance of @xmath7 mg , which lies outside the neutron - drip line by a few hundreds kev , can be 5/2@xmath6 and is expected to be a very sharp resonant state .",
    "neutron - rich mg isotopes with n @xmath120 21 were expected and seem to be ( prolately ) deformed . the spectroscopic study on the deformed odd - n isotopes",
    "are known to be valuable for obtaining the information on the shell - structure of neutrons in deformed one - body potentials .",
    "it is expected that the shell - structure of low - lying neutron resonant levels is similar to that of weakly - bound neutron levels . in particular , when the neutron @xmath13 resonant level occurs at a few hundreds kev the neutron @xmath12 resonant level will be found at nearly the same energy , though one - particle decay widths of those two resonances can be different by two orders of magnitudes .",
    "the spectroscopic information on the nucleus @xmath7mg@xmath1 is very helpful for confirming the shell - structure of one - particle resonant levels .",
    "i am looking forward to obtaining any experimental information on @xmath7 mg .",
    "the nucleus @xmath2c@xmath3 is another interesting nucleus from the present point of view .",
    "the core nucleus @xmath38c is expected to be oblately deformed based on good reasons . if so , the system of [ @xmath38c + one neutron ] , namely @xmath2c@xmath3 , may be oblate .",
    "then , it is expected that though the nucleus @xmath9c may lie only very slightly outside the neutron - drip - line , it will not be found as a recognizable resonant state , in agreement with available experimental findings .    in the present work the pair - correlation is neglected since only light nuclei are considered . even when the pair - correlation is effective in the present nuclei , the spin - parity estimated for the lowest resonance of @xmath7 mg and @xmath9c will not be changed while the estimated decay width may be changed .",
