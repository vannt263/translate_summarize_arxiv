    "the apparent relationship between the mass of a super - massive black hole ( smbh ) and that of the pressure - supported spheroid hosting it ( e.g. @xcite ) is one of the most clear empirical indications of the potential importance of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and accretion - driven feedback mechanisms in galaxy formation and evolution theories .",
    "indeed , the peak of qso activity has been established at @xmath3 ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , at the same epoch when star formation activity in the universe was also at its peak .",
    "these processes often co - exist in galaxies , with observational evidence for the presence of an embedded agn in ultraluminous starburst galaxies @xcite and in 20 - 30% of @xmath3 massive star - forming galaxies in the great observatories origins deep surveys ( goods , @xcite ) fields ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is an essential if galaxy formation theories are to be tested that an assessment of the importance of embedded agn activity in star forming galaxies be made at moderate to high redshifts . as such we need to identify the contribution of obscured accretion activity in bolometric surveys of the evolution of star formation . in other words ,",
    "we need to identify and separately trace the total ( obscured and unobscured ) star formation in the bulges of individual high - redshift galaxies , the related nuclear activity , and any star formation occurring on larger scales within a disk . only by doing this",
    "will we be able to obtain a bolometrically complete census of star formation and of the growth of galaxies and their smbhs .",
    "however , a complete census of both star formation and agn galaxy activity , especially at high redshifts , is challenging due to dust extinction and gas obscuration by circumnuclear material .",
    "deep radio surveys provide a powerful , obscuration - independent tool for measuring _ both _ star formation and agn activity in high - redshift galaxies , hence tracing the apparently simultaneous development of the stellar populations and the black - hole growth in the first massive galaxies . indeed",
    ", multi - wavelength studies of deep radio fields show a composite population of star - forming galaxies and agn ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , with the former dominating at the lowest flux densities ( @xmath4@xmath2jy ) .",
    "interestingly , about half of the agns probed in the deepest radio fields are characterised by relatively low radio - to - optical flux density ratios ( @xmath5 ) , as compared to classical radio - loud agns ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this is a direct evidence of radio - quiet agns being present at @xmath2jy flux levels .",
    "such a result supports the idea that radio - quiet agns are not necessarily radio silent ( see @xcite ) , and paradoxically opens the perspective of studying the entire agn population , including the radio - quiet component , at radio wavelengths .",
    "radio - quiet agns share many properties with star - forming galaxies : they have similar radio luminosities ( @xmath6whz@xmath7 ) and similar infrared / radio flux ratios .",
    "in addition radio - quiet agns are typically characterised by seyfert-2-like optical spectra , which are often difficult to distinguish from those of star - forming galaxies ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this makes it difficult to separate radio - quiet agns from star - forming galaxies , even with multi - wavelength information , although the availability of irac colors and/or x - ray data can help ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "this position differs by about 1arcmin from the pointing centre used by m05 , but was chosen to maximise s / n at known source locations .    a sub - array of five of the seven _",
    "e-_merlin telescopes were used throughout these pilot observations , with the 76-metre diameter lovell and the 32 m cambridge telescopes being unavailable at the time .",
    "the absence of the cambridge antenna reduces the maximum spatial resolution of our 5ghz observations , making it comparable to that of the previous 1.4ghz merlin+vla observations ( see m05 ) .",
    "furthermore , the omission of the lovell telescope gives rise to an approximately homogeneous array with 25 m diameter elements , yielding a predictable primary beam .",
    "the 5ghz data were taken in four adjacent @xmath18mhz intermediate frequency channels ( ifs ) and observed both circular polarizations , with correlator outputs integrated every second .",
    "the observations were conducted with a cycle time of 1.5min on the phase calibrator and 8minutes on the goods - n target yielding a total on - source integration time of 106hours .",
    "the data were inspected , flagged , calibrated and imaged using the nrao aips package , following standard procedures for wide bandwidth observations .",
    "visibilities that were clearly corrupted by instrumental phase errors , telescope errors , or radio frequency interferences were spectrally removed ( channel by channel ) by using the tasks spflg and ibled .",
    "all the calibrators and target data were then combined into a single multi - source file and averaged down to @xmath19mhz channels , considerably reducing the size of the dataset .",
    "the absolute flux - density scale was calibrated through observations of sources 3c286 ( primary flux calibrator ) and 1407 + 284 ( oq208 , secondary point - source calibrator ) with flux density boot - strapped to 3c286 .",
    "assuming a point - source model and a spectrum within the observing band for oq208 we established a flux density equal to 2.45jy at the central observing frequency ( @xcite scale ) .",
    "+ the flux calibrator 1407 + 284 was also used for bandpass calibration whereas phase correction of visibilities were calibrated by observing the calibrator source 1241 + 603 , located 2@xmath20 away from the pointing centre . the average flux density for 1241 + 603 was measured to be 0.216@xmath210.007jy , a value consistent with the flux reported by the vlba calibrator list ( nrao ) ( @xmath22jy at 5ghz ) .",
    "+ the visibilities were then re - weighted to take into account the different sensitivities of the telescopes within the _ e-_merlin array and finally time - averaged ( 4s ) , in order to further reduce the data volume and speed up the imaging process .",
    "the effects of frequency and time averaging on the derived source fluxes are discussed in sect .",
    "[ sect - images ] .",
    "we produced total intensity images of all 92 radio sources presented in m05 .",
    "these were obtained by averaging the four available ifs ( task imagr ) and restoring clean components with a circular beam of 0.5arcsec diameter .",
    "image dimensions measure 128@xmath23128 pixels and a cellsize equal to 0.0625arcsec was chosen generating fields some 8arcsec across . whenever a detection was found within one of the 0.5arcsec resolution fields , a higher resolution ( 0.2arcsec ) map was re - imaged .",
    "the only exception is source j123725 + 621128 , a relatively extended double radio source ( see last panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : images ] and source details in sect .",
    "[ sect - details ] ) , where higher resolution imaging was not attempted in order to probe the extended emission visible at 1.4ghz ( m05 ) .",
    "we also imaged 10 unresolved sources from the original 1.4ghz vla catalog produced by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) with arcsec - scale flux density @xmath24@xmath2jy , located within a distance of 10arcmin from our field centre at 0.2arcsec resolution .",
    "these sources lie in a region outside the usable primary beam of merlin so were not included in m05 .",
    "all the images were cleaned until the peak of the residuals was about three times the rms noise ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "cleaning deeper risks so - called `` clean bias '' , that may affect deep imaging in presence of poor uv coverage ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "frequency channels at the edges of the passband are generally characterized by very low sensitivity , therefore the lowest rms noise level in the final images is obtained by excluding these channels .",
    "this results in an effective bandwidth of 120mhz within each if .    the average off - source noise level , measured before correction for the primary beam , in our naturally - weighted images at 0.2arcsec and 0.5arcsec resolution is @xmath26 and @xmath27jybeam@xmath7 respectively . from image analysis we verified that the noise is close gaussian , however , the values reported above are about 2 times higher than expected from thermal noise .",
    "the cause of sensitivity degradation in these early _ e-_merlin commissioning 5ghz observations have been identified with elements of the signal path introducing noise in the data signal .",
    "following these observations , additional first stage amplification has been introduced to mitigate this effect .",
    "the images were corrected for the primary beam attenuation , adopting the parameters used for the vla antenna at 5ghz .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption since all the antennas participating to our _ e-_merlin observations are effectively 25-metre dishes . the primary beam correction results in rms noise which increases as a function of distance from the pointing phase centre , varying from approximately 20 - 30@xmath2jy within 200arcsec of the pointing centre , to 40 - 50@xmath2jy at 300arcsec before rapidly growing to several hundred micro - janskys .",

    "e-_merlin observations , together with a factor of @xmath42 worse sensitivity than for the 1.4ghz observations ( coupled with the fact that extended synchrotron emission is typically characterized by a declining spectrum with frequency ) .",

    "the measured source parameters are presented in table  [ tab : images ] which include the distance from the pointing centre , the local rms noise value , the peak position , the signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) , the integrated flux density at 1.4 and 5ghz .",

    "for unresolved sources , the integrated flux density is equal to the peak brightness , obtained through a quadratic polynomial fitting ( aips verb maxfit ) , whereas for the two extended sources , the integrated spectral flux density is derived by integrating over a circular region with radius of 5 pixels centred on the peak flux position .",

    "such fluxes have to be compared to our @xmath47 detection threshold .",

[ sect - intro ] , a clear separation between agn and star - formation processes in galaxy samples can be very difficult , especially at high redshifts , where gas / dust obscuration can be very important and composite systems ( where both phenomena co - exist ) are likely to be more frequent .",

    "was proposed by m05 for most ( @xmath55 ) of their 92 radio sources .",
    "nine additional sources were later classified by @xcite .    as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sect - intro ] , one of the most direct ways to pinpoint embedded agn cores in galaxies is the detection of a flat - spectrum high surface brightness self - absorbed radio core through high resolution multi - frequency observations . in this paper , we take advantage of our pilot sub - arcsec 5ghz _ e-_merlin observations , to better assess the presence of agn cores in goods - n galaxies . by combining our 5ghz maps with the",
    "recently re - cleaned and primary beam corrected merlin+vla data at 1.4ghz ( wrigley et al . in prep ) , obtained at same resolution , we derived 1.45ghz spectral indices for 10 of the 17 detected sources .",
    "spectral index information and radio morphologies were both used to confirm previous agn classification , when available , and to provide a new one for the sources still unclassified .",
    "the spectral index information is particularly relevant here , first because the radio morphology alone does not necessarily allow us to discriminate a compact starburst from an agn core ( see discussion above , item iii ) .",
    "secondly , brightness temperature measurements would not help us in the source classification , as the spatial resolution of our observations is not high enough to be sensitive to excess of 10@xmath37k .",
    "indeed , the angular resolutions of our maps ( 0.2 - 0.5arcsec fwhm ) give brightness temperatures in a range ( 700 - 5000k ) .",
    "our classification also takes advantage of any pre - existing multi - wavelength information , in line with those used by m05 and @xcite .",
    "spectral index analysis of m05 ( see item iv above ) was based on 1.4 and 8.5ghz radio fluxes obtained from arcsec resolution images ( 3.5arcsec , @xcite ) , whereas our spectral indices are instead derived between 1.4 and 5ghz sub - arcsec resolution flux densities .",
    "the latter are therefore better suited to pinpoint flat - spectrum compact agn cores .",
    "for the unresolved sources at 5ghz , the spectral index is derived using the peak flux density of the corresponding 1.4ghz component , when the peaks at the two frequencies overlap .",
    "for the two sources ( j123624 + 621743 and j123650 + 620844 ) with a significant positional offset between the peaks at the two frequencies ( see discussion in sect .",
    "[ sect - images ] ) we do not provide a spectral index . for the two extended sources at 5ghz ( j123644 + 621133 and j123646 + 621404 ) we derived the total flux at the lower frequency integrating over the same region used to derive the flux density at 5ghz .",
    "it is worth noting that for source j123725 + 621128 we detect only the emission from a region eastwards the core , and therefore the spectral index refers to this area .",
    "one caveat must be stated clearly : whereas the 1.4 and 8.5ghz observations were made relatively close in time ( 1 - 2years ) , our _ e-_merlin 5ghz observations are separated from the 1.4ghz data by more than 10 years .",
    "variability in the radio domain may therefore be an issue and should be considered in the interpretation of our spectral indices .",
