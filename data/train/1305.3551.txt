    "in paper  i we found it numerically convenient for our nrg calculations to start not from a pure kondo model but from an effective anderson - type model , because it is then possible to obtain an improved spectral function by using the so - called `` self - energy trick '' @xcite , which involves calculating the impurity - level self - energy .",
    "it has recently been shown@xcite that a similar strategy can be used for kondo - type models , but this fact was brought to our attention only after completion of the present study @xcite .",
    "we here adhere to the strategy of paper i and adopt the following anderson - type model , @xmath24 which reduces to a kondo - type model at low energies@xcite .",
    "the index @xmath25 labels @xmath7 degenerate local levels as well as @xmath7 independent channels of conduction electrons , each forming a flat band of half - bandwidth @xmath26 with constant density of states @xmath27 per spin and channel .",
    "( in the remainder of the paper , all energies are specified in units of half - bandwidth , unless indicated otherwise . )",
    "@xmath28 is the annihilation operator of an impurity electron with spin @xmath29 in level @xmath25 , whereas @xmath30 annihilates a reservoir - electron in channel @xmath25 with wave number @xmath31 and energy @xmath32 .",
    "levels and channels are tunnel - coupled diagonally in spin and channel indices , resulting in a width @xmath33 for each level , @xmath34 being the hopping matrix element between impurity and reservoir .",
    "the third term in @xmath35 describes a hund - type exchange interaction with @xmath36 , added to favor a local spin of @xmath8 , where @xmath37 is the total impurity spin operator , @xmath38 is the spin operator for an electron in level @xmath25 , and @xmath39 are pauli spin matrices .",
    "the last term in @xmath35 describes the effect of an applied local magnetic field , with @xmath40 . to ensure particle - hole symmetry ( which renders the numerics more efficient )",
    "we take @xmath41 for the local level positions and do not include any further charging energy .",
    "the energies of the free orbital ( fo ) states are given by roughly @xmath42 and the energy difference between two fo - states that differ by spin @xmath2 is therefore given by @xmath43 = { j_{\\rm h}}^{(n)}(s+\\frac{1}{4})$ ] . to focus on the local moment regime of the anderson model ,",
    "we choose @xmath44 such that @xmath45 is significantly larger than @xmath46 and @xmath47 , ensuring a well - defined local spin of @xmath8 , and an average total occupancy of the local level of @xmath48 .",
    "moreover , the ratios @xmath49 are chosen such that the resulting kondo temperatures have comparable magnitudes .    in paper",
    "i , we had implemented this strategy using the same @xmath50 for all three @xmath7-values , with @xmath51 and @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "we have since realized that much better nrg convergence properties can be obtained by choosing much larger values of @xmath44 , to ensure that the energy differences of the fo states truly lie well above the bandwidth ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "this is the numerical counterpart to a schrieffer - wolff transformation @xcite : it shifts the numerically most expensive , yet irrelevant , fo - regime to an energy range which lies outside the range whose energies are finely resolved during the nrg diagonalization , thus reducing the numerical costs needed for treating the anderson model to a level comparable to that of the kondo model . for the numerical calculations presented here , we set the level width to @xmath56 and choose @xmath44 such that the resulting spectral functions have the same half - width at half maximum @xmath57 for all three cases , @xmath58 , thus ensuring that the kondo temperatures are equal .",
    "this is achieved by choosing the hund couplings as @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .    for the model in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kondo_am ] ) , the resistivity and decoherence rate due to magnetic impurities ( relevant for weak localization ) can be calculated as follows @xcite:@xmath62 \\sqrt{{\\gamma_{\\rm m}}(\\omega , t ) } \\right]^2 , \\\\ \\label{eq : def2_gammam } & { \\gamma_{\\rm m}}(\\omega , t)= -\\frac{{\\gamma_{\\rm m}}^0}{2n } \\sum_{\\alpha\\sigma } \\left [ { \\rm im}(\\gamma g^r_{\\alpha\\sigma}(\\omega ) ) + \\vert \\gamma g^r_{\\alpha\\sigma}(\\omega ) \\vert^2 \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath63 is the fully - interacting retarded impurity green s function , @xmath64 is the derivative of the fermi function , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the resistivity due to static disorder and @xmath68 the corresponding elastic scattering time . for",
    "_ real _ materials with complex fermi surfaces , both prefactors @xmath69 and @xmath70 contain material - dependent ( hence unknown ) factors arising from integrals involving the true band structure of the conduction electrons .",
    "within the nrg , the non - interacting bath in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kondo_am ] ) is coarse grained using the dimensionless discretization parameter @xmath71 , followed by the mapping onto the so - called wilson chain in terms of the fermionic wilson sites @xcite @xmath72 with @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , @xmath74 , where    @xmath75    with @xmath76 where @xmath77    the impurity spin is coupled to a semi - infinite tight - binding chain with the exponentially decaying couplings @xmath78 . for large enough @xmath79",
    ", this ensures energy scale separation , and thus justifies the iterative diagonalization of the hamiltonian in the representation of the wilson chain .",
    "@xcite in particular , the energies of the hamiltonian @xmath80 at intermediate iterations which include all terms @xmath81 , are rescaled in units of @xmath82 , where @xmath83 here the constant @xmath84 is chosen such that @xmath85 an analytic expression for @xmath84 in the presence of @xmath86-shifts is given in ref .  .",
    "to obtain the green s function @xmath63 , which determines @xmath87 and @xmath88 , we calculate the spectral function @xmath89 using its lehmann representation : @xmath90 where @xmath91 , with @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , @xmath95 being the eigenenergies and many - body eigenstates obtained by nrg in the full density matrix ( fdm)-approach @xcite .",
    "note that due to the @xmath22 symmetry of the hamiltonian , the spectral function @xmath96 does not depend on the index @xmath25 .",
    "thus when exploiting non - abelian symmetries , in practice , one calculates the channel - independent symmetrized spectral function @xmath97 , which corresponds to the normalized scalar contraction @xmath98 of the spinors @xmath99 . @xcite",
    "[ sec : methods ]    for the calculation of @xmath5 the knowledge of both the real and the imaginary part of @xmath100 is necessary .",
    "the real part can be determined via the kramers - kronig relations from @xmath101 after smoothing the discrete data .",
    "@xmath102 , on the other hand , requires only the imaginary part of the green s function .",
    "this makes the application of the kramers - kronig relations and with it the broadening of the discrete data unnecessary and @xmath87 can therefore be directly calculated from the discrete data @xcite , thus avoiding possible broadening errors .",
    "furthermore , due to particle - hole symmetry , it is sufficient to calculate @xmath101 only for one spin @xmath29 , since the spectral functions for opposite spins @xmath29 and @xmath103 are symmetric with respect to each other : @xmath104 .      as mentioned in the introduction , when using abelian symmetries the calculations described above are standard for @xmath9 and @xmath14 , but a real challenge for @xmath13 .",
    "the reason is that the number of degenerate eigenstates in a typical symmetry multiplet increases strongly with the rank of the symmetry group .",
    "for example , for the present model with @xmath13 , the typical degeneracy quickly becomes of order @xmath105 to @xmath106 even for low - lying energy multiplets ( this is illustrated by the presence of long `` plateaux '' in the excitation spectra shown in fig .  1 below ) .",
    "this implies that the number of kept states needs to increase dramatically , too .",
    "moreover a crucial prerequisite for well - converged results is that the multiplet structure should be respected during nrg truncation .",
    "no multiplet should be kept only partially , i.e.  cut in two ; instead , each multiplet should be kept or discarded as a whole . in the present paper , cutting multiplets",
    "is avoided by implementing non - abelian symmetries explicitly and keeping all multiplets below a specified truncation energy , as described further below . in paper",
    "i , which implemented only abelian symmetries , we had used the more conventional nrg truncation scheme of specifying the total maximum number of states to typically be kept .",
    "however , we had adjusted this number as needed to ensure that the lowest - lying discarded states were not degenerate with the highest - lying kept states . moreover , the energy of the highest kept multiplet turned out to lie just below a wide gap in the energy spectrum [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : kept - states](a ) ] . in our subsequent work",
    "we have found that the presence of this wide gap considerably stabilizes the results ; when we keep some more multiplets such that the highest ones lie just above the wide gap , the results deteriorate considerably , as judged by the criterion discussed next .",
    "calculations from ( a ) paper  i and ( b ) this work , for the lowest eigenstates ( blue circles ) and truncation energy ( dashed red line ) of nrg iteration @xmath107 .",
    "this iteration includes the impurity and the first two wilson sites @xmath108 and @xmath109 , which by eq .",
    "( [ eq : kondo_am : wilson ] ) corresponds to @xmath110 ; it is the first iteration where truncation occurred .",
    "all energies @xmath111 are given in units of @xmath112 [ c.f .",
    "( [ eq : escale ] ) ] . in ( a ) , each dark blue dot marks an eigenstate ; in panel ( b ) each dark blue dot marks a multiplet , whose degeneracy is indicated by the length of the adjacent light blue lines .",
    "dashed red lines indicate the truncation energy @xmath113 . in paper",
    "i , the number of kept states at iteration @xmath107 was 4840 which was 216 states short of truncating into the wider energy gap starting at @xmath114 .",
    "for the present paper , we chose the truncation energy to lie well within a wide spectral gap and kept 16 384 out of 262 144 states [ only a small subset of which are shown in the main panel of ( b ) ] .",
    "this large number was achievable by grouping the kept states into 2,688 symmetry multiplets with internal degeneracy .",
    "the insets of ( a ) and ( b ) show , respectively , the full spectrum of states or multiplets at iteration @xmath107 .",
    "( the fine structure seen in the main panel in ( b ) is not resolved in the inset , since the latter uses a much coarser energy resolution on the vertical axis . ) the spectra in ( a ) and ( b ) have different fine structure , because the model parameters were chosen differently in paper  i and the present work , respectively : the former used @xmath115 , @xmath116 , the latter @xmath61 , @xmath56 . as a result , the energy separation between degenerate multiplets at the truncation energy is different , namely @xmath117 in ( a ) versus @xmath118 in ( b ) , where @xmath119 is the hopping matrix element between the first two sites of the wilson chain [ c.f .",
    "( [ eq : kondo_am : wilson ] ) ] .",
    "the different values of @xmath120 and @xmath119 used in ( a ) and ( b ) are indicated by black lines in the plots . ]",
    "the criterion used in paper  i  to judge the quality of convergence was based on the friedel sum rule@xcite , which for the present model implies that the kondo peak of the zero - temperature spectral function should satisfy @xmath121 . for paper",
    "i  this check was satisfied to within 2% for spectral functions calculated using the self - energy trick , which we had taken as indication that the data could be trusted . when calculated _ without _ the self - energy trick , though , the kondo peak height was off by 1% , 16% and 32% for @xmath9 , 2 and 3 , respectively , which , in retrospect , indicates lack of full convergence for the latter two cases .",
    "indeed , this became apparent _",
    "a posteriori _ in the course of the present study when we reanalyzed the nrg data of paper  i  using a more reliable tool for checking nrg convergence that had been developed in 2011@xcite , based on monitoring the discarded weight . in essence , the discarded weight measures the relevance of the highest - lying kept states for obtaining an accurate description of the ground state space a few iterations later .",
    "more concretely , it is calculated as follows : construct a reduced density matrix for a chain of length @xmath122 from the mixed density matrix of the ground state space of a chain of length @xmath123 by tracing out the last @xmath124 sites ( typically @xmath125 to ensure that all eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix are non - zero ) ; find the eigenvalues and eigenstates of this reduced density matrix , say @xmath126}$ ] and @xmath127 , and sort them according to their energy expectation values , @xmath128 } = \\langle r_{i;i_0 } | \\hat h_i | r_{i;i_0}\\rangle$ ] .",
    "the weight @xmath129}$ ] contributed by the highest - lying 5% of states in this energy - sorted list then provides an estimate for the discarded weight at iteration @xmath122 .",
    "it provides a quantitative measure for the importance of the discarded states had they been included in the description of the ground state space of iteration @xmath123 by keeping a larger number of states . repeating this analysis for different sites @xmath122 ,",
    "the largest @xmath130 value is taken to define the `` discarded weight '' of the entire wilson chain , @xmath131 .",
    "the entire analysis concerns the kept space only , hence it is fast relative to the actual nrg calculation itself .",
    "well - converged physical quantities are obtained when the discarded weight satisfies @xmath132 . for the nrg data used in paper  i ,",
    "the discarded weight calculated _ a posteriori _ turned out to be @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 for @xmath136 and @xmath137 , respectively .",
    "this indicates lack of proper convergence for @xmath14 , and especially for @xmath13 .      for the calculations presented here",
    ", we therefore use an improved code , which also exploits non - abelian symmetries @xcite . here , the idea is to make use of the fact that degenerate states can be gathered into symmetry multiplets . by the wigner - eckart theorem , matrix elements including states from the same multiplet",
    "are then related via clebsch gordan coefficients .",
    "thus , it is sufficient to keep track not of all individual states inside each multiplet , but only of entire multiplets , and to store only one reduced matrix element for each multiplet .",
    "this drastically reduces the size of the matrix which has to be diagonalized at an nrg iteration , with corresponding reductions in calculation times and memory requirements .",
    "our model possesses the following non - abelian symmetries : @xmath138 particle - hole symmetry , @xmath139 spin symmetry ( in the absence of magnetic field ) and @xmath22 channel symmetry . for many of our calculations ,",
    "we need @xmath23 , in which case the @xmath138 spin symmetry is reduced to an abelian symmetry using @xmath19 . moreover",
    ", particle - hole symmetry and channel symmetry do not commute in general , yet their combination generates the larger symplectic symmetry @xmath140 ( ref .  ) .",
    "this symmetry , which encompasses both particle - hole and channel symmetry , fully exhausts the model s symmetry ; consequently no degeneracies remain between different @xmath140 multiplets ( a typical multiplet contains several hundreds up to several thousands of states ) . for the calculations presented in this work , using @xmath22",
    "[ rather than @xmath141 turned out to be sufficient .",
    "here we use @xmath22 channel symmetry together with total charge for @xmath142 and particle - hole symmetry for @xmath9 .",
    "the gain in numerical efficiency due to these symmetries is huge .",
    "for example , for @xmath13 , the largest @xmath22 multiplets kept in our nrg calculations already reach dimensions of above 100 . by exploiting these symmetries ,",
    "calculation times as well as memory requirements are reduced by more than two orders of magnitude compared to those of paper i. as a consequence , the calculations presented here can be simply performed within a few hours on standard workstations .",
    "we used an nrg discretization parameter of @xmath143 , and perform @xmath86-averaging @xcite with @xmath144 ( and @xmath145 ) to minimize discretization artifacts @xcite . for @xmath13 , the computationally most challenging case , we used the following truncation scheme .",
    "for the diagonalization of @xmath146 , all states were kept . for iteration @xmath107 , we used a truncation energy [ given in rescaled units of @xmath147 , c.f.eq .",

    ", we used @xmath150 , except for @xmath151 at iteration @xmath152 , where we used @xmath153 to reduce computational costs due to the extraordinary large density of states at that iteration ; this choice of parameters corresponds to keeping @xmath154 multiplets ( @xmath155 states ) . using this scheme , a single nrg run for @xmath13 required about 40 gb of ram and took on the order of 10 hours of calculation time on an 8-core processor .",
    "the subsequent calculation of the spectral function required a similar amount of time and 55 gb memory .",
    "the large number of kept multiplets then resulted in high numerical accuracy .",
    "in particular , the spectral functions calculated with and without using the improved self - energy , already agreed very well with each other , which clearly demonstrates fully converged numerical data . having established this for a few representative cases , we proceeded to calculate the data presented below without using the self - energy trick .    , 2 and 3 ,",

    "the reason for the difference is the lack of full convergence of the abelian nrg data .",

    "this comparison thus highlights both the benefits of exploiting non - abelian symmetries in order to reduce convergence problems , and the importance of checking the latter in a reliable fashion by monitoring the discarded weight .",
    "the fact that the resistivity curve for @xmath13 shows a more gradual decrease with increasing temperature for the new non - abelian results than for the old abelian ones , implies that fits to experiment will yield a larger kondo temperature for the former , as we indeed find below .",

    "since the fitting procedure of @xmath180 described above leaves no further free parameters , this comparison is an additional strong check of the validity of the @xmath13 model .",
    "the experimental data of @xmath169 for the sample agfe2 are shown together with the numerical data for @xmath182 in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho(t , b ) ] .",
    "[ the values of @xmath180 differ for @xmath204 , due to the different @xmath181-values determined from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhonrg ] ) . ]",
    "again , the three - channel model reproduces the measured results best . even though there are still slight deviations between theory and experiment at high magnetic field for the @xmath13 curves at 0.1  k and 0.85  k , which might originate from very small temperature drifts , the overall agreement , combined with that for @xmath205 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gammam(t ) ] ) and @xmath16 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rho(t ) ] ) , is rather impressive .",
    "thus , we conclude that the @xmath13 model consistently reproduces all the transport data discussed above .    , @xmath14 , for several different choices of @xmath206 .",
    "]      to conclude this section , let us briefly discuss the possibility that the true effective kondo model for fe in au and ag could include some channel anisotropy .",
    "channel anisotropy , if present at all , will be weak for the present system due to a symmetry agrument . as mentioned in the introduction , fe acts as substitutional defect in au or ag ; it hence finds itself in an environment with cubic symmetry .",
    "this cubic symmetry protects the equivalence of the three local @xmath12 levels and of the three bands involved in the effective low - energy kondo model .",
    "in particular , this cubic symmetry offers a rather strong protection against any splitting of the @xmath12 levels . a significant spin - orbit coupling , which could result in a spliting of the @xmath12 levels ,",
    "was ruled out by density functional theory calculations in paper i.    with this in mind , let us nevertheless briefly discuss the possible effects of channel anisotropy , that could arise if some perturbation breaks the cubic symmetry . in general , such a perturbation could result in a small splitting in the @xmath7 impurity @xmath207-levels that yield the spin @xmath208 , or in slightly different band widths or density of states for the @xmath7 conduction - band channels , or in slighlty different coupling strenghts between local and band states in each channel .",
    "all of these will will have similar effects on the low - energy kondo physics .    for concreteness ,",
    "we consider here only the latter case , implemented in our model by setting @xmath209 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , leading to channel - dependent level widths @xmath210 . for a spin-@xmath208 , @xmath7-channel kondo model",
    ", the presence of channel anisotropy quickly leads to a multi - stage kondo effect,@xcite characterized by @xmath7 different kondo temperatures @xmath211 , in which channels of decreasing @xmath212 successively screen the bare spin @xmath208 first to spin @xmath213 , then to @xmath214 , etc . , down to 0 .",
    "since the corresponding kondo temperatures @xmath211 depend exponentially on @xmath212 , even a small amount of channel anisotropy changes the shape of the resistivity curve @xmath180 drastically .",
    "in particular , it spoils the purely logarithmic temperature dependence of the resistivity for @xmath215 that is characteristic of the channel - isotropic kondo effect : though each screening stage separately produces a logarithmic contribution to the resistivity , the sum of these contributions no longer behaves purely logarithmically , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : anisotropy ] for @xmath14 . our experimental data ,",
    "however , do not show signatures of such multi - stage kondo physics .",
    "this implies that any channel anisotropy , if present , is weak .",
    "therefore the differences between the various @xmath211-values associated with the successive stages of screening are , first , too small to be discernible in the data , and second , not at all required for the interpretation of the experimental data .",
    "we conclude that a fully channel - symmetric model suffices .",
    "we have considered iron impurities in gold and silver and compared experimental data for the resistivity and decoherence rate to nrg results for a fully screened @xmath7-channel , spin-@xmath216 kondo model . compared to previous work on this subject @xcite , we showed improved numerical data for both quantities at finite temperature .",
    "in particular , we offered a detailed discussion of nrg convergence and truncation issues , using the discarded weight as a criterion for reliably judging the quality of convergence .",
    "our most important new result is the analysis of the resistivity at finite magnetic field , where we compare the numerical calculations with as yet unpublished experimental data .",
    "in contrast to previous attempts to explain the experimental results with models with less channels which were inconsistent or yielded several different values for the kondo temperature , depending on which set of measurements was used to extract @xmath3 @xcite , we showed that all examined quantities can be described consistently with a single value of @xmath3 . the excellent agreement between experiment and theory for @xmath13 shows that both systems are well described by a spin-3/2 three - channel kondo model .",

    "<S> this lends additional support to the conclusion of costi _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _  that the latter model provides a good effective description of the kondo physics of iron impurities in gold and silver .    the magnetic alloys for which the kondo effect was first observed , in the 1930s , were iron impurities in gold and silver @xcite </S>",
    "<S> they showed an anomalous rise in the resistivity with decreasing temperature , which kondo explained in 1964 as being due to an antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between the localized magnetic impurity spins and the spins of the delocalized conduction electrons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for his work , kondo used a spin-@xmath2 , one - band model , which undoubtedly captures the essential physics correctly in a qualitative way .    </S>",
    "<S> however , detailed comparisons between theory and experiment have since shown that this model does not yield a </S>",
    "<S> _ quantitatively _ correct description of the kondo physics of dilute fe impurities in au or ag . </S>",
    "<S> such a description must meet the challenge of quantitatively reproducing , using the kondo temperature @xmath3 as only fitting parameter , several independent sets of experimental measurements : the contributions by magnetic impurities ( indicated by a subscript m ) to the temperature- and field - dependence of the resistivity , @xmath4 , and to the temperature - dependence of the decoherence rate , @xmath5 , extracted from weak ( anti)localization measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the spin-@xmath2 , 1-band kondo model does not meet this challenge : when comparing its predictions , obtained by the numerical renormalization group ( nrg)@xcite , to transport measurements on dilute fe impurities in ag wires , different kondo scales were required for fitting the resistivity and decoherence rates @xcite .    in a recent publication ( ref .  , involving most of the present authors , henceforth referred to as paper i ) , it was argued that the proper effective low - energy kondo model for fe in au or ag is , in fact , a fully screened , spin-@xmath1 three - channel kondo model . </S>",
    "<S> paper  i  arrived at this conclusion by the following chain of arguments . </S>",
    "<S> previous transport experiments@xcite had indicated that these systems are described by a fully screened kondo model@xcite , i.e.  a kondo model in which the local spin , @xmath6 , is related to the number of conduction bands , @xmath7 , by @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned above , the choice @xmath9 had already been ruled out in earlier work @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> density - functional theory calculations for fe in au and ag , presented in paper  i , showed that in these host metals fe preferentially acts as a substitutional defect with cubic symmetry , leading to a substantial crystal field splitting ( @xmath10  ev ) between a higher - lying @xmath11 doublet and a lower - lying @xmath12 triplet . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the local spin moment was predicted to be 3 bohr magnetons , with an almost fully quenched orbital angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> this suggested a fully - screened kondo model with @xmath13 as the most likely candidate , while leaving some scope for the possibility of @xmath14 ( but none for @xmath15 or 5 ) . to discriminate between the options @xmath14 and 3 , @xmath16 and @xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> were then calculated using nrg , for @xmath9 ( as reference ) , 2 and 3 . </S>",
    "<S> next , for both material systems ( fe in au and ag ) , the @xmath16 curves were fitted to experimental data to obtain a kondo temperature , @xmath17 , for each of the three models . finally , using these @xmath17-values , the @xmath5 curves , which constituted parameter - free predictions of the decoherence rate , </S>",
    "<S> were compared to corresponding measurements , with the conclusion that the choice @xmath13 worked distinctly better than @xmath14 .    </S>",
    "<S> the goal of the present paper is two - fold : first , we describe technical details of the numerical calculations performed in paper  i that could not be presented there for lack of space . </S>",
    "<S> second and more important , we extend the analysis of paper  i to the case of finite magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , though experimental data for @xmath18 had been available for fe in ag even at the time of writing of paper  i , it had not been possible then to compare them to theoretical predictions for @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that multichannel calculations present an enormous challenge for the nrg , as the numerical complexity grows exponentially with the number of channels . in paper  </S>",
    "<S> i only abelian symmetries ( charge conservation in each channel and total spin @xmath19 ) were exploited . for the purposes of paper  </S>",
    "<S> i , this turned out to be sufficient , but for the aforementioned three - channel kondo model the calculations were numerically extremely costly , and even at @xmath20 just barely within the limits of feasibility . when the present authors attempted , in subsequent work ( unpublished ) , to treat the more general case of a finite magnetic field using the same approach , the latter turned out to be inadequate , plagued by numerical convergence issues . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , further progress required enhancing the numerical efficiency by exploiting non - abelian symmetries .    </S>",
    "<S> now , the effective fully screened symmetric three - channel kondo model mentioned above has several _ </S>",
    "<S> non_-abelian symmetries , including , in particular , an su(3 ) channel symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the eigenspectrum of the hamiltonian can be organized into degenerate symmetry multiplets , and great gains in numerical efficiency can be made by exploiting this multiplet structure at every step of the nrg procedure . </S>",
    "<S> we took this observation as incentive to implement non - abelian symmetries in our code on a completely generic footing for tensor networks such as the nrg.@xcite although the exploitation of symmetries , abelian as well as non - abelian , together with their respective strong gain in numerical efficiency is well known in the literature , the treatment of non - abelian symmetries in nrg has been largely restricted to the symmetry of su(2 ) @xcite . the non - abelian symmetry su(2 ) , however , is simpler than the general case , since for @xmath21 the @xmath22 representation theory involves complications due to the presence of inner and outer multiplicities . </S>",
    "<S> a generic numerical framework for treating arbitrary non - abelian symmetries thus had been missing , and became available only very recently.@xcite    more specifically , the model hamiltonians studied here possess su(2 ) particle - hole symmetry , @xmath22 channel symmetry , and su(2 ) spin symmetry for @xmath20 or abelian @xmath19 symmetry for @xmath23 . by exploiting the non - abelian symmetries , we were able to drastically reduce the computational effort and generate fully converged numerical data , even for the highly challenging case of three channels . with a significantly more powerful nrg at our hands </S>",
    "<S> then , the following analysis serves two purposes . </S>",
    "<S> first , we present a thorough reanalysis of paper  i with improved nrg data . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we give a detailed discussion of nrg truncation and convergence issues , which are under much better control with the new non - abelian scheme . </S>",
    "<S> the new numerical results show discernible quantitative differences w.r.t .  </S>",
    "<S> paper  i , leading to changes in the deduced kondo temperatures that are quite substantial for @xmath13 ( the relative change in @xmath3 is 31% for fe in au and 53% for fe in ag ) . </S>",
    "<S> second , we present a detailed analysis of the new numerical magnetoresistivity data and compare these to experimental results for fe in ag . </S>",
    "<S> the results of both analyses fully confirm the main conclusion of paper  i : the effective microscopic model for dilute iron impurities in the noble metals gold and silver is given by a fully screened three - channel kondo model .    </S>",
