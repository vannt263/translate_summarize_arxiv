    "synchrotron radiation is emitted by high energy electrons gyrating in a magnetic field .",
    "the first clearly understood observation came from the early betatron experiments in which electrons were first accelerated to relativistic energies ( blewett 1946 , elder et al . 1947 , 1948 ) .",
    "although nonthermal radiation had been observed from the galaxy from the opening of radio astronomy in the pioneering work by karl jansky in 1933 , there was no clear evidence of its origin . in 1950",
    "kiepenheuer suggested that galactic nonthermal radio emission was synchrotron radiation and alfvn and herlofson proposed that non - thermal discrete sources were emitting synchrotron radiation .",
    "kiepenheuer showed that the intensity of the nonthermal galactic radio emission can be understood as the radiation from relativistic cosmic ray electrons that move in the general interstellar magnetic field .",
    "he found that a field of @xmath1  gauss ( @xmath2 tesla ) and relativistic electrons of energy @xmath3  ev would give about the observed intensity .",
    "the early 1950s saw the development of these ideas ( e.g. ginzburg et al .",
    "1951 and following papers , see ginzburg 1969 ) that synchrotron emission was the source of non - thermal `` cosmic '' radiation .",
    "this model was later supported by maps which showed that the sources of the non - thermal components were extended nebulae and external galaxies and by the discovery that the radiation was polarized as predicted by theory .",
    "the synchrotron theory is widely accepted and is the basis of interpretation of all data relating to nonthermal radio emission .    in this model",
    "the observed non - thermal emission is the emission of relativistic electrons in the weak galactic magnetic fields .",
    "the strength of the galactic magnetic fields is , generally , such that only highly relativistic electrons can be responsible for emission in the microwave and radio bands .",
    "there are three diffuse galactic emissions ",
    "synchrotron , free - free , and dust  which provide a significant confusing foreground to cmb anisotropy observations .",
    "figure [ figgal ] shows as a function of frequency the approximate relative intensity of the galactic synchrotron , free - free , and dust emission in relation to the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "= 5.7truein    the dust emission arise from the thermal reradiation of absorbed stellar light .",
    "the synchrotron emission is from relativistic cosmic - ray electrons originating in supernovae or other interstellar shocks and subsequently larmor accelerated in interstellar magnetic fields .",
    "the free - free emission is the thermal bremsstrahlung from hot ( @xmath4k ) electrons produced in the interstellar gas by the galactic uv radiation field . at meter wavelengths where synchrotron emission dominates the sky ,",
    "maps show a galactic ridge about 5@xmath5 wide and a much more widely spread emission .",
    "the ridge , sometimes called the non - thermal disk , follows the galactic plane and is a few times broader than the hydrogen disk and thus wider than the galactic plane free - free emission .",
    "extending well beyond this ridge is a very wide distribution of nonthermal radiation , called the nonthermal halo or corona .    particularly at low galactic latitudes the synchrotron and free - free emission",
    "are recognized as individual radio sources mostly associated with recent star formation .",
    "thermal emission comes from hii regions in the vicinity of hot stars while the non - thermal synchrotron emission comes from supernova remnants .",
    "radio surveys of the galactic plane show in addition unresolved emission concentrated to the plane with the non - thermal emission being about twice the width of the thermal emission .",
    "evidence for a wider distribution of low density electrons which result in diffuse free - free comes from pulsar dispersion measure observations .",
    "these show the presence of a 1 kpc thick electron layer well beyond the denser 100 pc thick electron layer co - located with the ob star distribution .",
    "thus the synchrotron is wider than the free - free which in turn is wider than the bulk matter distribution of the galactic disk region .",
    "large features with a synchrotron spectrum extend far from the galactic plane .",
    "the most prominent of these are the spurs and loops which describe small circles on the sky with diameters in the range 60@xmath5 to 120@xmath5 ( berkhuijsen , haslam & salter 1971 ) .",
    "because of their association with hi and in some cases with x - ray emission , they are believed to be low surface brightness counterparts of the brighter supernova remnants seen in lower latitude surveys such as that by duncan et al . ( 1995 ) at 2.4 ghz",
    ". other more diffuse structure at higher latitudes may be even older remnants .",
    "synchrotron emission results from cosmic - ray electrons accelerated in magnetic fields , and thus depends on the energy spectrum of the electrons and the intensity of the magnetic field ( rybicki and lightman 1979 , longair 1994 ) .",
    "electrons of a given energy ( @xmath6 ) radiate over a wide spectral band , with the distribution peaking roughly at @xmath7 , with a long low - power tail at higher frequencies , and most of the radiation in a 2:1 band from peak .",
    "figure [ figses ] shows this dependence .",
    "the peak intensity is at @xmath8 .",
    "= 5.0truein    the radiation from a single electron is elliptically polarized with the electric vector maximum in the direction perpendicular to the projection of the magnetic field on the plane of the sky .",
    "explicitly the total emissivity of a single electron via synchrotron radiation is the sum of parallel and perpendicular polarization @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the electron direction pitch angle to the magnetic field @xmath11 and @xmath12 is shown graphically in figure [ figses ] .    the quantity @xmath13 is the dimensionless frequency defined as @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the critical synchrotron frequencies .",
    "an electron accelerated by a magnetic field @xmath11 will radiate . for nonrelativistic electrons",
    "the radiation is simple and called cyclotron radiation and its emission frequency is simply the frequency of gyration of the electron in the magnetic field .",
    "however , for extreme relativistic ( @xmath17 ) electrons the frequency spectrum is much more complex and extends to many times the gyration frequency .",
    "this is given the name synchrotron radiation . the cyclotron ( or gyration ) frequency @xmath18 is @xmath19 for the extreme relativistic case , aberration of angles cause the radiation from the electron to be bunched and appear as a narrow pulse confined to a time period much shorter than the gyration time .",
    "the net result is an emission spectrum characterized by a critical frequency @xmath20    to understand the astrophysical radiation , one must consider that cosmic ray electrons are an ensemble of particles of different pitch angles @xmath10 and energies @xmath21 .",
    "it can generally be assumed that the directions are fairly isotropic so that integration over pitch angles is straightforward .",
    "the next step is integration over electron energy spectrum to determine the total synchrotron radiation spectrum .    if the electrons direction of motion is random with respect to the magnetic field , and the electrons energy spectrum can be approximated as a power law : @xmath22 , then the luminosity is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a weak function of the electron energy spectrum ( see longair , 1994 , vol .  2 ,",
    "page 262 for a tabulation of @xmath24 ) , @xmath25 is the length along the line of sight through the emitting volume , @xmath11 is the magnetic field strength , and @xmath26 is the frequency",
    ".    at very low frequencies synchrotron self - absorption is very important as according to the principle of detailed balance , to every emission process there is a corresponding absorption process . at the lowest frequencies synchrotron self - absorption",
    "predicts an intensity that increases as @xmath27 .",
    "this does not follow the rayleigh - jeans law because the the effective kinetic temperature of the electrons varies with frequency ( @xmath28 longair 1994 ) .",
    "spectra of roughly this form are found at radio , centimeter , and millimeter wavelengths in the nuclei of active galaxies and quasars . for our galaxy",
    "the flux density increases at long wavelengths ( @xmath29  m ) roughly proportional to @xmath30 .",
    "this is an effect that is due to self- and free - free absorption .",
    "the local energy spectrum of the electrons has been measured to be a power law to good approximation , for the energy intervals describing the peak of radio synchrotron emission ( at gev energies ) .",
    "the index of the power law appears to increase from about 2.7 to 3.3 over this energy range ( webber 1983 , nishimura et al 1991 ) .",
    "such an increase of the electron energy spectrum slope is expected , as the energy loss mechanisms for electrons increases with the square of the electron energy .",
    "the synchrotron emission at frequency @xmath26 is dominated by cosmic ray electrons of energy @xmath31 .",
    "the range of energies contributing to the radiation intensity at a given frequency depends on the electron energy spectrum : the steeper the electron distribution , the narrower the energy range ( longair 1994 ) . for the case of most of the galaxy , this range is of order 15 to 50 .",
    "the observed steepening of the electrons spectrum at gev energies is used to model the radio emission spectrum at ghz frequencies ( e.g. banday & wolfendale , 1990 , platania et al .",
    "over the years several researchers have attempted to map the antenna temperature of the sky at radio frequencies .",
    "radio astronomers have concentrated on the study of discrete objects at high resolution , rather than on the investigation of the diffuse foreground .",
    "radio maps of the galaxy are not readily available . at present",
    "the only existing full - sky survey is the 408 mhz survey by haslam et al .",
    "( 1982 ) shown in the color figure [ fig408 ] .",
    "it consists of observations conducted with several instruments over a 10 year span .",
    "although it has excellent angular resolution ( 0.85@xmath5 ) , the errors associated with the zero level and gain stability of the data are sufficiently large to produce significant uncertainties in the extrapolation of the measured sky brightness to higher frequencies , and , most seriously , there is no comparable quality map at another frequency for extrapolation that accounts for spectral index variation .",
    "maps with partial sky coverage have been made at frequencies between 35 and 1500 mhz ( see lawson et al .",
    "1987 for a discussion ) .",
    "table [ tabmaps ] summarizes existing maps with significant northern hemisphere coverage .",

    "clear variations in spectral index of at least 0.3 were found . a steepening in the spectral index at higher frequencies in the brighter features such as the loops and some snrs . up",

    "frequencies higher than 2 - 3 ghz no reliable zero levels have been measured for large area surveys .",
    "the relevant observational material comes from beam switching or interferometric data . accordingly",
    "the spectrum of individual features is estimated . on scales of a few degrees the temperature spectral index between 5 ghz ( melhuish 1997 ) and 408 mhz was @xmath49 . similarly the 10 , 15 , 33 ghz beam switching data ( hancock et al .",
    "1997 ) also indicated a spectral index of @xmath49 at 10 ghz .",
    "these results show that at higher galactic latitudes synchrotron emission dominates up to 5 ghz and most likely to 10 ghz .",
    "platania et al .",
    "( 1997 ) has used high frequency data from a number of sky locations to investigate the frequency dependence of the synchrotron emission spectral index and also find evidence for a steepening .",
    "based on the local cosmic ray electron energy spectrum , the synchrotron spectrum should steepen with frequency to about -3.1 at these higher microwave frequencies .",
    "in addition their comparison of a 19 ghz map ( cottingham 1987 ) and the 408 mhz map ( haslam et al . 1982 ) showed clear evidence for spatial variation in the synchrotron spectral index .",
    "the north polar spur is quite evident as its synchrotron spectral index is steeper than the average as was previously known .",
    "a part from this feature , the synchrotron spectrum appears flatter than average at high galactic latitudes .",
    "in order to interpret observations it is necessary to separate the various galactic emissions from the cmb anisotropies and extragalactic foregrounds .",
    "the cmb , thermal , and non - thermal emissions can be separated by virtue of their differing frequency spectral indices .",
    "free - free emission in the optically thin domain , appropriate to cmb observations at 30 ghz and above , has a brightness temperature spectral index of 2.1 @xmath50 0.1 . in the case of synchrotron emission from the galaxy",
    "the spectral index at frequencies up to a few ghz is 2.6 to 3.0 ( lawson et al . 1987 ) .",
    "the synchrotron spectral index varies from position to position whether it is measured in snrs or in the more extended galactic features . at a given position the synchrotron spectral index",
    "is expected to change with frequency .",
    "optically thick synchrotron emission gives a strongly inverted spectrum ( @xmath51 ) , independent of the energy distribution of electrons , producing a low frequency cutoff .",
    "for very compact , high density regions cutoff frequencies as high as several ghz are observed .",
    "likewise , compact and dense hii regions may be optically thick , and have an inverted spectrum ( @xmath52 ) up to relatively high frequencies .",
    "it will be necessary to investigate the possible existence of sources with high absorption cutoffs , which are undetectable at low frequencies .",
    "due to radiation energy losses by the relativistic electrons the synchrotron spectrum will steepen by 0.5 at higher frequencies ; the turnover frequency will depend on the age of the electrons and the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "the spatial variation of the emissions is also significant and cmb observations routines discard the data in regions of high emission , e.g. near and on the galactic plane .",
    "another feature that might be used is the properties of the angular power spectrum .",
    "an important consideration in this context is what is the angular power spectrum of the synchrotron emission particularly at intermediate and high galactic latitudes .",
    "before the power spectrum can be determined , it is necessary to remove the baseline stripes in the most commonly used radio maps at 408 and 1420 mhz .",
    "these stripes which contain power on angular scales of a few to ten degrees can be largely removed ( davies , watson & gutierrez 1996 ) . lasenby ( 1996 ) has used the 408 and 1420 mhz surveys to estimate the spatial power spectrum of the high latitude region surveyed in the tenerife experiments and found an angular power spectrum slightly flatter than @xmath53 .",
    "grski et al .",
    "1996 found an angular power spectrum @xmath54 which is one power steeper than scale - invariant cmb anisotropies .",
    "a complicating issue is that synchrotron emission is linearly polarized by its very nature .",
    "surveys at frequencies less than about 1 ghz where faraday depolarization is significant show polarized structure at a level of a few tens of percent ( e.g. spoelstra 1984 ) . at the higher frequencies sampled by cmb observations",
    "faraday depolarization will be minimal and higher percentage polarizations will be expected , perhaps reaching 30 to 50 percent as found in some snrs and galactic spurs .",
    "spatial structure in polarization ranges from 10 arcmin to tens of degrees in the spurs and loops ( spoelstra 1984 , wieringa et al .",
    "1993 , duncan et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
