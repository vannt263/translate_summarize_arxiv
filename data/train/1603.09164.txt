    "a blogger can publish a new post and can re - blog an existing public post which is automatically broadcasted to it s followers unless it is enabled as a private post @xcite . the type of posts can be chosen among seven different categories including multi - media and other content : text , quote , link , photo , audio , video and url . unlike twitter , tumblr has no limit on the length of textual posts . similar to hashtags in twitter , there are separated tags associated with the blog content that make a post easier to be searchable on tumblr .",

    "we extract these bloggers until the graph converges without re - visiting a blogger . the proposed framework results into a connected graph that represents a tumblr network .",
