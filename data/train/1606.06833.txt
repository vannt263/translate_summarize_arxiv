    "recently , there has been much interest in using the quantum annealing algorithm ( qaa ) @xcite which utilizes quantum tunneling to aid in solving commercially interesting problems .",
    "a complete list of all potential applications would be too long to give here .",
    "however applications have been studied in such diverse fields as finance @xcite , computer science @xcite , machine learning @xcite , communications @xcite , graph theory @xcite , and aeronautics @xcite , illustrating the importance of such algorithms to real world problems .",
    "while some of these applications rely on the ability of the qaa to perform optimization by finding the lowest energy state of a classical problem hamiltonian , others such as @xcite , instead rely on the fact that open quantum systems effects allow for sampling of an approximate boltzmann distribution .",
    "i will discuss both of these techniques in due course .    the archetypal model for quantum annealing ,",
    "because of its connection to condensed matter physics as well as the fact that it can be implemented on real devices @xcite is the transverse field ising model , with hamiltonian @xmath0 given by    @xmath1    where    @xmath2    encodes the problem of interest , @xmath3 is the hardware graph , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the annealing schedule , which determines how the energy scales of the transverse and longitudinal terms change with the annealing parameter , @xmath6 .",
    "the problem is encoded by speficifying the values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "for the qaa , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and @xmath4 decreases monotonically while @xmath5 increases monotonically with increasing @xmath11 .",
    "applying the qaa consists of monotonically increasing @xmath11 with time such that the ground state of the system changes over time between the ( known ) ground state of the transverse part of the hamiltonian ( @xmath12 ) to the solution of the ( classical ) problem to be solved , eq .",
    "( [ eq : isgham ] ) .",
    "the search space of the transverse ising model is a hypercube where each vertex corresponds to a bitstring , the dimension is equal to the number of qubits , and the hamming distance between classical states corresponds to the number of edges which must be traversed between the states .",
    "this structure is independent of the interaction graph defined by @xmath8 which along with @xmath7 determine the energy at each vertex .",
    "i choose to focus on the transverse field ising model for concreteness , and because the action of the transverse field is a quantum analogue of single bit flip updates in classical monte carlo .",
    "however , the arguments presented in this paper should hold for most other search spaces as well , with hamming distance replaced with a more general notion of search space distance .",
    "the qaa can be though of as analogous to classical simulated annealing ( sa ) in which quantum fluctuations mediated by the addition of non - commuting terms to a classical hamiltonian , play the role which temperature plays in sa .",
    "simple sa , however , has been superseded by more sophisticated algorithms , such as parallel tempering @xcite , population annealing @xcite , and isoenergetic cluster updates @xcite to name a few .",
    "this then begs the question of whether quantum annealing hardware can be used in a clever way to gain the advantages of these modern classical algorithms , by using a hybrid algorithm employing both quantum and classical search techniques , or by using multiple quantum searches in a sequential way to make algorithmic gains .",
    "the qaa , as it is currently designed , is not amenable to such adaptations .",
    "it is a global search , and there is no obvious way to insert information , from either a classical algorithm or previous runs of the qaa , in a meaningful way to improve the performance .",
    "furthermore , the qaa is fundamentally different from classical annealing in that , due to the famous no - cloning theorem @xcite of quantum mechanics , we can not determine exactly what the intermediate state of the system is part way though the anneal .",
    "this is in direct contrast to sa , where every intermediate state is known , and can be manipulated arbitrarily to build better algorithms . for example , classical gains can be made by running many runs in parallel and probabilistically replacing poor performing copies with those which are performing well ( population annealing ) , or raising the temperature for those which perform poorly and lowering it for those which perform well ( parallel tempering ) .    in order to build quantum versions , let us consider a subroutine similar to qaa , but which performs a local search of a region of phase space with a controllable size around a user selected initial state .",
    "the input and output of a single step of this algorithm is completely classical , so the no - cloning theorem is no longer a barrier and these local quantum searches can be combined arbitrarily with both other quantum searches and classical searches . using this",
    ", i construct analogues to state - of - the - art classical algorithms , but made of quantum building blocks , i also demonstrate how to construct new hybrid algorithm which can use any classical algorithm which meets a very general set of criteria as a subroutine .",
    "it is worth pointing out here that this kind of search has been considered in a limited scope in recent work by others @xcite .",
    "i further argue    that these subroutines will be less sensitive to noise in the form of problem mis - specification than the qaa .",
    "the typical random energy differences between states due to these errors scales like @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the total number of qubits . a local search , however , only searches a small subspace of the total solution space , and therefore only errors which occur on states within this subspace are relevant",
    ". a local search can therefore give meaningful results even in a problem where the global optimum is no longer correctly specified due to noise .",
    "this manuscript is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : optimization - and - sampling ] i give a brief overview of the currently used optimization and sampling techniques which will be discussed in this manuscript . in sec .",

    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "to explain the new method i propose , it is useful to first summarize some classical and quantum optimization techniques which are currently studied . the list given here is not intended to be exhaustive , and in particular will only cover some of the classical techniques from the monte carlo ` family ' of methods , those which use metropolis weighted updates . a metropolis update is an update which is performed probabilistically in the following way : if the update lowers the energy of a state it will be performed with @xmath15 probability ; however if the update increases the energy than it will be performed with a probability equal to @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the change in energy and @xmath18 is an effective temperature . because metropolis updates obey detailed balance , they can be used to sample a thermal distribution as well as to find ground states , assuming all other update steps also obey detailed balance .      in sa an initial state",
    "is chosen randomly and is updated by flipping individual spins according to metropolis rules .",
    "the temperature parameter is then reduced according to an annealing schedule until @xmath19 is reached .",
    "sa derives its name from the fact that metropolis rules updates obey detailed balance , and therefore an sa run can be thought of as a simulation of a physical spin system which is cooled under classical dynamics .      in parallel tempering @xcite , multiple copies of a system are initialized in random states each with a different temperature parameter .",
    "spin flip metropolis updates are applied on each copy .",
    "these temperature parameters are kept fixed , but additional update rules are applied to swap the temperature of copies probabilistically in a way which obeys detailed balance .",
    "these rules mean that poorly performing copies have a high probability of having their temperature raised so that they perform a long range exploration of the solution space , whereas the temperature of copies which perform well are reduced so that their search becomes more local .",
    "because parallel tempering is able to abort explorations of regions for which the algorithm performs poorly it provides a substantial improvement over sa .",
    "there is no known physical phenomenon which is an analogue of parallel tempering .",
    "population annealing @xcite also uses multiple copies of the same system , again initialized in random states . unlike what is done in parallel tempering ,",
    "spin flip metropolis updates are performed on all copies at the same temperature and it is slowly reduced according to an annealing schedule . in population annealing there is also an update rule beyond simple metropolis updates .",
    "these rules probabilistically delete poorly performing copies , and replicate those which perform well in a way which not only obeys detailed balance but also for which the average population remains constant and does not explode exponentially , or decay to zero . as with parallel tempering , population annealing contains a mechanism to abort searches which perform poorly , and provides a substantial improvement over sa .",
    "the performance gains over sa from parallel tempering and population annealing have been observed to be comparable @xcite .",
    "again , there is no known physical phenomenon which is an analogue to population annealing .",
    "the qaa is an algorithm in which quantum fluctuations act in an analogous way to the way in which metropolis updates are used in sa .",
    "the strength of the quantum fluctuations is then slowly turned down according to an annealing schedule , this could be performed for instance using the transverse field ising model hamiltonian in eq .",
    "[ eq : annealerham ] . for the purposes of this paper , i use qaa to refer to the process by which quantum fluctuations are slowly turned down , and",
    "not the specific nature of the fluctuations .",
    "there are actually two mechanisms by which the qaa can obtain the ground state of the hamiltonian . in a closed quantum system setting the adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics guarantees that , for slow enough evolution , the system will remain in its ground state as long as it is initialized in its ground state @xcite",
    ", this is conventionally called adiabatic quantum computation ( aqc ) @xcite . for discussion of the effect of open quantum system phenomena on aqc ,",
    "see @xcite . on the other hand , in an open quantum system setting with a low temperature bath , interactions with the bath can lead transitions toward lower energy states , this mechanism is known as quantum annealing ( qa ) @xcite .",
    "the qaa is performed on an analog physical system , which can be thought of as an analog computer . rather than being an analogue to a physical process as sa is",
    ", the qaa is a physical process itself .",
    "qaa - like protocols have also been successfully implemented in condensed matter systems @xcite .",
    "while the quantum distribution obtained from the qaa will not generally be the thermal distribution one would find with zero transverse field , it has been demonstrated experimentally that a quantum annealer can be used for thermal sampling under some circumstances @xcite , it has also been demonstrated numerically that in some cases the transverse field can act as an effective proxy for finite temperature @xcite .",
    "recent work has also suggested that the dissipation from open quantum system effects in qa can lead to an improvement in performance over aqc @xcite .",
    "a continuous time quantum random walk @xcite is a quantum protocol by which a quantum system is allowed to evolve under a fixed quantum hamiltonian to explore a solution space .",
    "it has been demonstrated that continuous time quantum random walks yield a similar degree of quantum advantage as other quantum search algorithms @xcite , for further extensions to spatial searches , see @xcite . as i discuss later , in the limit of instantaneous annealing ,",
    "the local search protocol which i propose is a quantum random walk with a localized starting condition and subject to noise from a fixed temperature bath .",
    "whether the dominant search mechanism is open system effects ( qa ) , or the adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics ( aqc ) , the qaa uses a single monotonic anneal , and therefore is a quantum analog of sa .",
    "there is no sense in which the qaa can abort poorly performing searches in favor of those which perform better .",
    "the reason that using the qaa may still be preferred over either parallel tempering or population annealing is that qaa may grant a large quantum advantage .",
    "if such an advantage were larger than the classical advantage which advanced techniques such as parallel tempering or population annealing have over sa , then the qaa would be preferable .",
    "however , it is possible , especially for early generations of annealers , that only a modest advantage , which is not as large as the advantage from advanced classical techniques is present . in this case",
    "the qaa would still be out - performed by these advanced techniques so would not be a desirable approach to real world problems .",
    "however a technique which could gain a small quantum advantage ( possibly not even as large as the one which the qaa has over sa ) along with the advantages of advanced classical techniques would still represent an improvement in the state - of - the - art .",
    "i examine three possible approaches to achieve this goal : a hybrid algorithm which combines local quantum searches with any classical algorithm which follows a very general set of criteria ( sec .",
    "[ sec : hybrid - computing ] ) , an analogue of parallel tempering which uses a local quantum search as a subroutine ( sec .",
    "[ sec : how - much - to ] ) , and an analogue of population annealing which uses a local quantum search as a subroutine ( sec .",
    "[ sec : how - much - to ] ) .",
    "it has been demonstrated experimentally that the qaa performs well in problems characterized by tall thin barriers in the energy landscape @xcite . on the other hand , from elementary arguments about quantum tunneling amplitudes",
    "@xcite it is expected to perform relatively poorly for energy landscapes characterized by wide , flat barriers .",
    "while it is possible to experimentally generate problems which are characterized by an energy landscape consisting of thin barriers @xcite it is unclear whether any problems with this structure are interesting in the real world .",
    "while looking for such problems is one interesting route for research , it is also worth thinking about how annealers may yield a benefit in phase spaces characterized by a mixed energy landscape , with many barriers of varying width .    in general one",
    "would not expect the phase space of a real optimization problem to have only thin energy barriers for which quantum tunneling yields a major benefit .",
    "one advantage of using local searches is that different methods can be used to traverse different types of features of the landscape . as an example , imagine the global optimum lies in a ` rough ' region of phase space with many tall thin energy barriers , but the phase space also has some relatively ` smooth ' global structure which would require tunneling through a very wide barrier as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : landscape_cartoon ] . in such a case",
    "the traditional qaa would perform poorly . on the other hand",
    "a classical search should be able to efficiently explore the larger features of the space and could easily find the rough region of phase space where quantum tunneling could then provide a major advantage .",
    "one key point about this example is that a quantum search would benefit even from _ random _ initialization , tunneling probability drops exponentially with barrier width , so if the barrier in the ` smooth ' part of the space was wide enough , the probability of successful tunneling to the rough region in the qaa would be zero for all practical purposes .",
    "on the other hand , if we assume that the quantum algorithm explores the rough region efficiently , then on random initialization the probability of success will be approximately proportional to the phase space volume of the rough region .    schematic representation way in which a hybrid algorithm can potentially gain an advantage in finding the local energy minima ( circled in green ) a ) wide energy barrier blocks tunneling for the qaa , leading to suboptimal solution in smooth region of the energy landscape .",
    "b ) a classical algorithm can be used to overcome the ` smooth ' features of the energy landscape , after which quantum tunneling can be used to explore rough parts of the landscape .",
    "c ) in this hypothetical example even random initialization can help the search if the initial wide energy barrier is avoided by chance . , width=264 ]    in a more complex phase space , optimization may potentially benefit from sequential use of a variety of algorithms in stages , feeding results between various classical algorithms and the quantum device .",
    "any classical algorithm or the qaa could be used to initialize such a protocol , but intermediate stages would have to be able to take one or more input value and search based on that input .",
    "fortunately , most classical algorithms are structured in such a way that they store intermediate states which are updated sequentially and therefore meet these criteria .",
    "the entire monte carlo ` family ' of algorithms ( parallel tempering , population annealing , isoenergetic cluster updates etc ... ) , for instance could all be used this way , as could genetic algorithms . as we discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : how - much - to ] , analogues of many of these classical monte carlo based protocols can be constructed and implemented with local search on a quantum annealer .    as i discuss in the next section , the important characterizing feature of a local search",
    "is its range . in the next section",
    "i discuss how the ability to control the range of a search can be used to construct hybrid quantum search algorithms .",
    "in contrast to the methods discussed in this section , where individual calls to a local quantum search can be interspersed with local classical search algorithms , in the methods i discuss in that section , all searches will be performed quantum mechanically , subject to an overall classical control structure which decides which local searches will be performed and at which range at each subsequent step .",
    "let us now examine more closely how control of the range of a local search may be used to gain a computational advantage . in the previous section",
    "i have outlined the basic idea of constructing hybrid algorithms from classical and quantum local searches , but have not yet specified how control over search range can be utilized . for this section",
    ", i will assume the existence of a local search protocol which searches a region around a point in solution space where the range is defined by a parameter @xmath20 , with @xmath21 corresponding to no search being performed ( stays in initial state with @xmath15 probability ) , and @xmath22 corresponding to a global search as performed by the traditional qaa , and intermediate values correspond to intermediate ranges . in sec .",
    "[ sec : local_search ]",
    "i will discuss how to implement such a protocol on an annealer an abstract way using the traverse field ising model and demonstrate that such a local search can be accomplished in a schedule which anneals to the point @xmath23 , @xmath24 after a preparation protocol . in sec .",
    "[ sec : hardware - implementation ] i will discuss the possibility of implementing such a search on real devices .",
    "i will not assume that the functional dependence of the range of the search in terms of the mean hamming distance explored , @xmath25 is known , only that the range monotonically increases with decreasing @xmath20 .",
    "i further will assume that @xmath25 may vary depending on the hamiltonian or initial state chosen .",
    "one could choose @xmath20 heuristically either by finding a value of @xmath20 which _ typically _ explores within a desired range for a given class of hamiltonians , or by doing several runs each time for different values @xmath20 of the local search subroutine is called and outputting the overall best solution(s ) found . while these heuristic techniques should work in principle , they are probably sub - optimal , so we therefore discuss a more sophisticated ways to approach this problem .",
    "additionally we discuss how this freedom to choose @xmath20 can be used to build analogues of powerful classical algorithms , but which make use of a quantum processor .",
    "i assume that each call to the annealer , which we will refer to as an _ annealing run _ and as the function annealer_call in our algorithms actually consists of multiple searches around the same point and defined by the same parameter , @xmath20 each of which i refer to as an individual _ annealing cycle_.    if a specific search radius is desired , for example by a maximum amount of error which can be tolerated due to problem mis - specification , then this search can be done adaptively .",
    "this is possible because while it may be extremely difficult to _ predict _ how much phase space will be explored in a given run , it is easy to check _ experimentally .",
    "_ all one needs to do is to gather a statistically significant sample and check the typical hamming distance from the initial state . based on these distances ,",
    "@xmath20 can be either reduced or increased .",
    "if the bisection adaptive search protocol given in algorithm [ alg : adaptive_s ] is used , the number of runs required scales logarithmically with the desired accuracy of @xmath20 .",
    "logarithmic scaling is achieved because the bisection method halves the search range for @xmath20 at each step , therefore , assuming that the search range has been estimated correctly , the precision of the parameter @xmath20 will improve exponentially at each step .    @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35    another method is to use the fact that the strength of the transverse field , and by extension @xmath20 , can act as a proxy for temperature to create analogues of familiar classical algorithms , which use quantum rather then thermal fluctuations to compute .",
    "i will examine here ways to create analogues of two such classical algorithms , parallel tempering and population annealing .    for parallel tempering ,",
    "we need to assign an effective temperature to each value of @xmath20 , for calculating swap probabilities and determining the optimal spacing of @xmath20 values used .",
    "i will demonstrate in sec .",
    "[ sec : local_search ] that the control parameter @xmath20 corresponds to a point in the annealing schedule @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "using this fact , an analogous temperature for any value of @xmath20 can be found in the following way .",
    "assume that a single qubit subject to a longitudinal field of unit strength is at the point @xmath20 in the annealing schedule , at this point the hamiltonian will be ,    @xmath36    this 2x2 hamiltonian can be diagonalized analytically yielding the following ratio in the ground state between the basis states in the classical basis    @xmath37    by comparing the quantum probability distribution to a boltzmann distribution on only the longitudinal part of eq .",

    "while the parallel tempering - like routine in algorithm [ alg : parallel_tempering ] will not obey detailed balance exactly , it may do so in an approximate sense and therefore may approximate a fair sampling of the local minima of the energy landscape . because the system must be annealed to the point @xmath76 at the end of each call to the annealer , the raw states extracted from this algorithm will not provide a good approximation of a thermal sample of the problem hamiltonian unless this step is performed very fast . on the other hand , these states",
    "do still provide very approximate information on the relative thermal probabilities to be found in different local minima , with quantum fluctuations acting as a rough proxy for thermal fluctuations .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that for some machine learning tasks a quantum distribution at finite temperature is actually preferable to a boltzmann distribution on a classical ising model .",
    "for other tasks it has been shown that using quantum fluctuations as a proxy for thermal distributions is sub - optimal , but makes little difference in practice @xcite .",
    "an approximate thermal sample can be obtained by first taking all of the data from the states output by algorithm [ alg : parallel_tempering ] at a desired @xmath39 ( perhaps throwing the first few iterations away as warm up period ) , and then applying the metropolis rules at @xmath124 to obtain a fair thermal sample within each of these local minima .",
    "for the estimation of the relative importance of local minima for sampling purposes , the mean energy found in each run may actually be a more appropriate measure , rather then the minimum energy which the annealer found , and therefore more accurate sampling results may be obtained if the minimum in line [ line : min_en ] of algorithm [ alg : parallel_tempering ] is replaced by the mean of all of the energies found in a run .",
    "similarly to the parallel tempering analogue , the population annealing analogue can be used to approximate thermal weight of different local minima and therefore to sample with appropriate post - processing . as with the parallel tempering the mean energy in an annealing run",
    "may be a more appropriate choice then the minimum energy as the criterion for how many copies of a replica to carry on to the next stage of annealing .    for the more generalized hybrid algorithm , or if an exact boltzmann distribution over the classical ising hamiltonian is desired , how to perform sampling is less clear , but sampling could still benefit from using these algorithms . while the hybrid algorithm may be able to give a more complete accounting of low energy local minima then other methods",
    ", it does not provide any clue on the relative thermal weights of each . in principle however , classical post processing could allow an estimate of the entropy and therefore free energy in disjoint local minima . by integrating the specific heat numerically using monte carlo techniques , these free energies",
    "could then be used find the appropriate weightings to calculate an overall boltzmann distribution .",
    "it is also worth noting that if fast annealing were available , as suggested in @xcite , then post processing would not be necessary for either the population annealing or parallel tempering as the distribution within each disjoint minimum would already be of the form desired for a quantum boltzmann machine .",
    "problem mis - specification , where the controls for stating the problem ( the hamiltonian for the qaa ) do not match what the user intended , is a major difficulty in analog computing @xcite . in real devices",
    "these mis - specifications come from a variety of sources , such as low frequency noise from the environment which mimics the control device or simply from the fact that the controls lack the precision to represent the actual intended problem . for the purposes of this discussion",
    "the source of the control error does not matter , only that it is effectively random and relatively uncorrelated . on real devices , techniques such as gauge averaging can be used to get rid of any correlation in the control error , and non - random components can be removed by repeated measurement and adjustments of the device .",
    "the effect of problem mis - specification is that the classical energies of states are changed randomly .",
    "the typical change in energy for any state in the phase space will be proportional to the energy from applying a hamiltonian corresponding to the mis - specifications to that state . by general statistical arguments",
    "this energy shift will be proportional to @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the total system size @xcite .",
    "if the mis - specification is strong enough compared to the energy difference between local versus global energy minima , then the optimum of the mis - specified hamiltonian will no longer correspond to the optimal solution of the target problem , and even a machine which finds the lowest energy state perfectly on the mis - specified hamiltonian can only obtain an approximate solution .",
    "problem mis - specification means that , as a device to perform the qaa is scaled , the errors must also be reduced or the device will no longer be able to reliably optimize , and any fundamental limit on the precision of the controls will also be a limit on the size of problem for which a such a device will be useful .",
    "the reason for this is that the qaa is a global search , corruption of the energy landscape anywhere in the phase space has the potential to destroy performance .    for a local search",
    "however , the total size of the space is irrelevant to the performance of the search .",
    "the reason is as follows , which state is optimum depends only on the relative energy of states which are explored , clearly shifts relative to the energy of states which are not searched will have no effect .",
    "errors due to problem mis - specification arise from the device being effectively ` tricked ' by bitstrings which have falsely been assigned a lower energy than the actual solution .",
    "the deviation in energy differences between the searched bitstrings is therefore the relevant quantity , and overall energy shifts in all states which can be reached are irrelevant",
    ".    local searches are not immune to problem mis - specification . however ,",
    "if i assume that the shape of the subspace explored is itself roughly in the shape of a hypercube then by the same arguments as @xcite , the relevant energy shift caused by the problem being incorrectly specified will go as @xmath125 where @xmath25 is the typical hamming distance between the states explored .",
    "while @xmath25 itself may scale with @xmath14 for a fixed @xmath20 , the value of @xmath20 can be adjusted for different system size based on the algorithm [ alg : adaptive_s ] , and therefore held fixed , thus removing the direct dependence of the error on @xmath14 . as i discussed previously , fixing the range of the search",
    "does mean that a quantum advantage can not be obtained beyond the range of the search , however , it does not preclude the possibility of such an advantage within the search range .",
    "even if the assumption that the subspace explored by the local search is roughly hypercubic in shape is relaxed , then the effective typical energy shift can still be upper - bounded using the following arguments . increasing",
    "the number of states in a search space can never decrease the probability of the search space being corrupted by problem mis - specification .",
    "this is intuitively clear because if a bitstring exists in the search space which due to problem mis - specification has a lower energy than the correct solution , this bitstring will still be in the search space if it is expanded , and the search space will still be corrupted .",
    "therefore , if the furthest hamming distance between states reached in a local search is @xmath126 than the probability of state space corruption for the search space has to be less than the probability of corruption in a hypercubic space with size @xmath126 and therefore the effective typical energy shift must be less than @xmath127 , which again could be substantially less then the total system size , @xmath14 .    in principle",
    "local searches are still a valid optimization technique for arbitrarily large hamiltonians as long as each search does not search too large a subspace .",
    "let us now examine the question of whether the reprogramming step in fig .",
    "[ fig : runback ] is experimentally feasible . to do this we must discuss the details of how an annealer actually works . in this section",
    "i will first discuss in general terms why the methods proposed here should be practical on any annealer , this will be followed by a brief discussion of the feasibility of doing such searches specifically on the superconducting circuit hardware constructed by d - wave systems inc .    the local search protocol laid out in this paper does not require any modification of the parts of the protocol for which quantum mechanics plays a role .",
    "the only additional capability beyond what one should expect for any useful quantum annealer ( programmable hamiltonians , ability to adjust parameters over an appropriate range , some degree of coherent quantum interaction , etc ... ) , is the ability to program the state of the machine at the end of the anneal .",
    "as i have mentioned previously however , at this point the annealer is in a completely classical state and there is no need to protect a delicate quantum superposition .",
    "if the annealer architecture also supports individually addressable manipulation of individual qubits by either quantum or classical means then the necessary state can be initialized by first running the annealer with the desired hamiltonian and than measuring the result and applying appropriate gates to reach the desired state . in this case",
    "the problem hamiltonian does not ever need to be changed .",
    "one example for which this will certainly be true is a simulation of a quantum annealer which is run on a universal quantum computer , in this case no initial annealing run is even necessary , the bits can just be initialized in the @xmath128 state and than appropriate bit flips could be applied .    as i have discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : local_search ] , direct manipulation of the qubits is not necessary , as long as the hamiltonian can be reprogrammed at @xmath76 without disturbing the ( classical ) state of the bits .",
    "as the hamiltonian must already be programmable for an annealer to be useful , the necessary criteria for this to be possible is that the qubits either are naturally stable enough or can be made stable enough that their state is not changed by reprogramming the hamiltonian . even in a system which lacks natural stability ,",
    "such stability could be achieved for example by turning on strong field terms while the couplers are reprogrammed , and then turning the field terms off again .",
    "i now specifically discuss the superconducting circuit architecture by d - wave systems inc .",
    "these devices are based on superconducting circuits of the type shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : d - wave_circuit ] @xcite .",
    "one crucial aspect to the feasibility of the d - wave hardware for local searches is that it has been shown experimentally that open quantum system effects play a major role in the ability of the d - wave devices to perform tunneling and find ground states @xcite .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the importance of open quantum system effects does _ not _ indicate that the d - wave devices are classical rather than quantum solvers .",
    "in fact , for these devices there is experimental evidence of both entanglement @xcite and tunneling @xcite .    in the d - wave architecture",
    "there is classical superconducting control circuitry @xcite which is used to set the fields and couplers in eq .",
    "[ eq : isgham ] . tuning the components of this circuitry which are used to program these states",
    "will produce stray fields and heat which one may be concerned could disrupt the state of the qubits .",
    "the final classical state of these qubits should be very stable , and need not support any delicate quantum superpositions since it is a classical basis state .",
    "the reason for the stability is the way in which the qubits are implemented .",
    "the effective ising model in the d - wave device is produced by circuits which actually implement an effective double well potential @xcite , this potential is then tuned between a mono- and bi- stable regime .",
    "the ground and first excited state of each of these individual wells can be mapped to an effective ising spin , for which quantum tunneling between the wells mediates superposition states as illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : potential_cartoon ] .",
    "the strength of tunneling depends exponentially on the width and height of the barriers between these two wells , and therefore tuning far into the bistable regime strongly suppresses any quantum tunneling , and makes the qubits effectively classical . in this classical regime",
    "it may still be possible for external heat to cause the qubit to be excited over the energy barrier thermally . to avoid this problem",
    "one should be able to simply bias the qubits further into the bistable regime until the barrier heights are sufficient , or to perform the reprogramming more slowly so heat has more time to dissipate .",

    "if this is indeed the case , such experiments could provide a proof - of - principle for the ideas stated here .",
    "to go beyond proof - of - principle it would probably be desirable to optimize a machine to perform the protocol given in fig .  [",

    "i furthermore construct analogues of powerful classical algorithms , but using a quantum processor , and discuss how these methods can be applied to sampling with appropriate post - processing . because the protocol i propose is able to take advantage of state - of - the - art classical techniques , it will represent an algorithmic improvement even if the local searches gain only a small quantum advantage , in contrast the traditional qaa only provides such an improvement if the quantum advantage is at least as large as the classical advantage which advanced techniques such as parallel tempering have over simulated annealing .",

    "this is to prevent the trotter slices from becoming completely uncorrelated , and is consistant with the methodology of @xcite .",

    "this pre - anneal consisted of @xmath130 monte carlo sweeps run on the classical hamiltonian . after the pre - anneal",
