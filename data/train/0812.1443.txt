    "since the observed universe is almost homogeneous and isotropic , the space - time is usually described by a friedman - lamaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) cosmology .",
    "although this is a good approximation , the recent observations suggest the necessity of exploring beyond it .",
    "also it is believed that in the early universe the flrw model does not give a correct matter description .",
    "the anomalies found in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and the large structure observations stimulated a growing interest in anisotropic cosmological models of the universe .",
    "recently , cosmic strings have drawn considerable interest among the researchers for various aspects such as the study of the early universe .",
    "the presence of cosmic strings in the early universe could be explained using grand unified theories .",
    "these strings arise during the phase transition after the big bang explosion as the temperature goes down below some critical point .",
    "it is believed that the existence of strings in the early universe gives rise to the density fluctuations which leads to the formation of the galaxies .",
    "also the cosmic strings have been used in attempts to investigate anisotropic dark energy component including a coupling between dark energy and a perfect fluid ( dark matter ) @xcite .",
    "the cosmic string is characterized by a stress energy tensor and it is coupled to the gravitational field .    the presence of magnetic fields in galactic and intergalactic spaces is well established and their importance in astrophysics is generally acknowledged ( see e. g. the reviews @xcite and references therein ) . in spite of the fact that the present day magnitude of the magnetic energy is very small in comparison with the matter density , it might not have been negligible during early stages of the evolution of the universe .",
    "any cosmological model which contains magnetic fields is necessarily anisotropic taking into account that the magnetic field vector implies a preferred spatial direction .    among many possible alternatives ,",
    "the simplest and most theoretically appealing of anisotropic models are bianchi type - i ( bi ) . for studying the effects of anisotropies in the early universe on the present observed universe",
    ", bi models have been investigated from different points of view . in this class of models",
    "it is possible to accommodate the presence of cosmic strings as an example of an anisotropy of space - times generated by one dimensional topological defects .    in what follows",
    "we shall investigate the evolution of bi cosmological models in presence of a cosmic string and magnetic fluid .",
    "the paper has the following structure .",
    "we shall review the basic equations of an anisotropic bi model in the presence of a system of cosmic string and magnetic field .",
    "in section 3 we introduce a few plausible assumptions and investigate their outcomes .",
    "the objective of this treatment is to generate exact solutions to the einstein equations , supplemented with numerical and qualitative analysis . at the end",
    "we shall summarize the results and outline future prospects .",
    "the line element of a bi universe is @xmath0 there are three scale factors",
    "@xmath1 @xmath2 which are functions of time @xmath3 only and consequently three expansion rates . in principle",
    "all these scale factors could be different and it is useful to express the mean expansion rate in terms of the average hubble rate : @xmath4 where over - dot means differentiation with respect to @xmath3 .    in the absence of a cosmological constant , the einstein s gravitational field equation has the form    [ bid ] @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the energy momentum tensor for a system of cosmic string and magnetic field in a comoving coordinate is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the rest energy density of strings with massive particles attached to them and can be expressed as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the rest energy density of the particles attached to the strings and @xmath11 is the tension density of the system of strings @xcite which may be positive or negative . here",
    "@xmath12 is the four velocity and @xmath13 is the direction of the string , obeying the relations @xmath14    in @xmath15 is the electromagnetic field given by lichnerowich @xcite . in our case",
    "the electromagnetic field tensor @xmath16 has only one non - vanishing component , namely @xmath17 where @xmath18 is assumed to be constant . for the electromagnetic field @xmath19 one",
    "gets the following non - trivial components @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a constant characteristic of the medium and called the magnetic permeability .",
    "typically @xmath21 differs from unity only by a few parts in @xmath22 ( @xmath23 for paramagnetic substances and @xmath24 for diamagnetic ) .",
    "choosing the string along @xmath25 direction and using comoving coordinates we have the following components of energy momentum tensor @xcite :    [ total ] @xmath26    where we introduce the volume scale of the bi space - time @xmath27 namely , @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the evolution in time of @xmath29 is connected with the hubble rate : @xmath30    in view of @xmath31 from , one finds @xmath32 with @xmath33 some real constants .",
    "since the metric functions can be expressed in terms of @xmath29 , let us first derive the equation for @xmath29 .",
    "summation of einstein equations , , and 3 times gives @xmath34    taking into account the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor , i.e. , @xmath35 , after a little manipulation of one obtains @xmath36",
    "the above equations involve some unknowns and we need some supplementary relations between them to have a tractable problem .",
    "it is customary to assume a relation between @xmath8 and @xmath11 in accordance with the state equations for strings .",
    "the simplest one is a proportionality relation @xcite : @xmath37 the most usual choices of the constant @xmath38 are @xmath39    in order to solve the einstein equations completely , we need also to impose some additional conditions . in what follows we shall illustrate the general considerations by two examples .      as a first example , we shall follow the condition introduced by bali @xcite assuming that the average hubble rate h in the model is proportional to the eigenvalue @xmath40 of the shear tensor @xmath41",
    ". we shall only give the briefest account here and for further information the reader should consult @xcite .",
    "for the bi space - time we have @xmath42 writing the aforementioned proportionality condition as @xmath43 one comes to the following relation @xmath44 where @xmath45 is related to the proportionality constant @xmath46 and @xmath47 is an integration constant .    in this case takes the form @xmath48 and now reads @xmath49 where @xmath50 is another constant .",
    "let us now study and for different equations of state .",
    "assuming the relation ( [ rhoalphalambda ] ) between the pressure of the perfect fluid @xmath8 and the tension density @xmath11 from one finds @xmath51 with the solution @xmath52 while the equation for @xmath29 reads @xmath53 involving another constant of integration @xmath54 .",
    "this equation can be set in the following form @xmath55 where @xmath56 is an integration constant .",
    "more details for this model characterized by including some numerical computations are given in @xcite .",
    "the second case is more involved taking into account that the anisotropy is connected with the values of the shear distortions . besides the generalized hubble parameter we consider two relative shear anisotropy parameters defined by @xcite :    @xmath57    when @xmath58 the universe will be the isotropic flat friedman universe . in this second example",
    "we shall assume a deviation from the friedman model .",
    "we shall consider three different assumptions regarding the relative shear anisotropy parameters .",
    "although these assumptions are distinct , they entail mild time dependencies for @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "more exactly the time evolution of the scale factors @xmath1 is assumed to be very similar to that of the average hubble rate @xmath61 .",
    "let us assume that @xmath62 with @xmath63 a constant .",
    "in view of one finds , @xmath64 then , together with , we find the following expressions for metric functions    [ abcb ] @xmath65    in this case takes the form @xmath66 whereas , for @xmath29 in this case we have @xmath67    comparing this equation with the corresponding one ( [ ddtaucase1 ] ) from * case 1 * , it results that in * case 2 * the equation of evolution for @xmath29 is more intricate . in @xcite",
    "we gave some asymptotic solutions of this equation .",
    "here we give more general solution to the equation in question .    in what follows",
    "we express equations and as a new system of differential equations which is easier to analyze :    [ system ] @xmath68    this system was investigated qualitatively using numerical methods . to numerically integrate the above system of differential equations with rational polynomials in the right hand sides we use the following method : each of the variables @xmath69 was substituted by @xmath70 with @xmath71 .",
    "further we find the common denominator of the right hand sides and moving away it we find the new system of equation with new parameters .",
    "this removing is equivalent to the substitution of an independent variable . in the new variable",
    "the right hand sides of the differential equations , as well as the integrable functions themselves , possess finite variation .",
    "so in the compact region the integral curves happen to be stable if the initial value is given inside the region .",
    "it does not change if we numerically integrate them in natural parameters ( along the length of the curve ) .    for exemplification",
    "we make the following specific choices : @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 .",
    "we have investigated the system for two different values of @xmath38 , namely , @xmath79 and @xmath80 . to plot the graphs ,",
    "it is more convenient to use instead of the function @xmath81 , @xmath82 in order to convert their infinite ranges of variation into finite ones .",
    "the initial condition we give on the line where @xmath83 and study the evolution of all the four functions both through the past and future . in the figs .",
    "[ x11 ] and [ x-11 ] we plot the evolution of @xmath29 for a positive and negative @xmath38 , respectively , while in figs .",
    "[ x13 ] and [ x-13 ] we do the same for energy density . in figs . [ x13d ] and [ x-13d ] , * 3d * graph of @xmath29 , @xmath61 and @xmath8 has been illustrated for a positive and negative @xmath38 , respectively for the following initial values :",

    "the graphs of @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the projections from the extended space of dimension 4 + 1 on the plane with dimension 1 + 1 . therefore , the projections of integral curves can intersect . in the figures the integral curves correspond to different initial conditions with similar other parameters . in the figures [ x13d ] and [ x-13d ]",
    "the dot lines leads to the past , the solid ones to the future , while the point is the one where the initial condition of integration was given .",
    "there is also the possibility to assume that @xmath60 is constant and the analysis develops in the aforesaid manner , practically interchanging @xmath88 with @xmath89 .",
    "let us now assume the case when @xmath90 with @xmath91 a constant .",
    "this assumption leads to @xmath92 which together with gives @xmath93 thus we find @xmath29 to be a linear function of @xmath3 .",
    "it should be noted that analogical results occurs when the bi universe is filled with stiff fluid . on the other hand from one",
    "finds    @xmath94    in view of , and from one finds @xmath95 finally , inserting , into we find @xmath96 with @xmath97 another constant .",
    "thus the einstein system of equations has been completely solved .",
    "let us now assume the case when @xmath98 with @xmath99 being some constant .",
    "this leads to the relation    @xmath100    with @xmath101 being some arbitrary constant .",
    "this relation together with and gives    @xmath102    the system analogue to is :    [ system01 ] @xmath103    this system is quite similar to and choosing suitable parameters we find solutions which look as the ones illustrated in the previous graphs .",
    "we have offered an investigation of an anisotropic cosmological bi model . having in mind the complexity of the model we used some tractable assumptions regarding the parameters entering the model . for different assumptions regarding the shear anisotropy parameters and we get interesting models deserving the study . the analytical results are supplemented with numerical and qualitative analysis describing the evolution of a bi universe for different values of the parameters .    in our further studies",
    "@xcite we should like to see how the model isotropises at late times .",
    "any realistic model must lead to isotropisation necessary for compatibility with standard cosmological models at late times and in agreement with current observations .",
    "also it is important to know how stable is the model to perturbations of the parameters .",
