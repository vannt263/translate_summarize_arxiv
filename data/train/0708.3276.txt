    "in the standard model ( sm ) , lepton - flavor - violating ( lfv ) decays of charged leptons are forbidden ; even if neutrino mixing is taken into account , they are still highly suppressed .",
    "however , lfv is expected to appear in many extensions of the sm .",
    "some such models predict branching fractions for @xmath0 lfv decays at the level of @xmath15  @xcite , which can be reached at the present b - factories .",
    "observation of lfv will then provide evidence for new physics beyond the sm .    in this paper , we report on a search for lfv in @xmath16 decays into neutrinoless final states with one charged lepton @xmath17 and one vector meson @xmath2 : @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "a search for the @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 modes was performed for the first time at the cleo detector , where 90% confidence level ( cl ) upper limits ( ul ) for the branching fractions in the range @xmath29 were obtained using a data sample of 4.79 fb@xmath7  @xcite .",
    "later we carried out a search for these modes in the belle experiment using 158  fb@xmath7 of data and set upper limits in the range @xmath30  @xcite . here",
    "we present results of a new search based on a data sample of 543  fb@xmath7 corresponding to @xmath31 @xmath0-pairs collected with the belle detector  @xcite at the kekb asymmetric - energy @xmath32 collider  @xcite .",
    "the belle detector is a large - solid - angle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a silicon vertex detector , a 50-layer central drift chamber , an array of aerogel threshold cherenkov counters , a barrel - like arrangement of time - of - flight scintillation counters , and an electromagnetic calorimeter comprised of csi(tl ) crystals located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5  t magnetic field .",
    "an iron flux - return located outside the coil is instrumented to detect @xmath33 mesons and identify muons . the detector is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "two inner detector configurations were used .",
    "a 2.0 cm radius beam - pipe and a 3-layer silicon vertex detector were used for the first sample of 158  fb@xmath7 , while a 1.5 cm radius beam - pipe , a 4-layer silicon detector and a small - cell inner drift chamber were used to record the remaining 385  fb@xmath7  @xcite .",
    "we search for @xmath34 , @xmath10 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 candidates in which one @xmath0 decays into a final state with a @xmath1 , two charged hadrons ( 3-prong decay ) , and the other @xmath0 decays into one charged particle ( 1-prong decay ) , any number of @xmath35 s and missing particle(s ) .",
    "we reconstruct @xmath3 candidates from @xmath36 , @xmath4 from @xmath37 , @xmath5 from @xmath38 and @xmath6 from @xmath39 .",
    "the selection criteria described below are optimized from studies of monte carlo ( mc ) simulated events and the experimental data in the sideband regions of the @xmath40 and @xmath41 distributions described later . the background ( bg ) mc samples consist of @xmath42 ( 1524  fb@xmath7 ) generated by kkmc  @xcite , @xmath43 continuum , and two - photon processes .",
    "the signal mc events are generated assuming a phase space distribution for @xmath0 decay .",
    "the transverse momentum for a charged track is required to be larger than 0.06 gev/@xmath44 in the barrel region ( @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the polar angle relative to the direction opposite to that of the incident @xmath47 beam in the laboratory frame ) and 0.1 gev/@xmath44 in the endcap region ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) .",
    "the energies of photon candidates are required to be larger than 0.1 gev in both regions .    to select the signal topology , we require four charged tracks in an event with zero net charge , and a total energy of charged tracks and photons in the center - of - mass ( cm ) frame less than 11 gev .",
    "we also require that the missing momentum in the laboratory frame be greater than 0.6 gev/@xmath44 , and that its direction be within the detector acceptance ( @xmath50 ) , where the missing momentum is defined as the difference between the momentum of the initial @xmath8 system , and the sum of the observed momentum vectors .",
    "the event is subdivided into 3-prong and 1-prong hemispheres with respect to the thrust axis in the cm frame .",
    "these are referred to as the signal and tag side , respectively .",
    "we allow at most two photons on the tag side to account for initial state radiation , while requiring at most one photon for the @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 modes , and two photons except for @xmath51 daughters for the @xmath10 modes on the signal side to reduce the @xmath52 bg .",
    "we require that the muon likelihood ratio @xmath53 be greater than 0.95 for momentum greater than 1.0 gev/@xmath44 and the electron likelihood ratio @xmath54 be greater than 0.9 for momentum greater than 0.5 gev/@xmath44 for the charged lepton - candidate track on the signal side . here",
