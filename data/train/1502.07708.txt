    "a good organic solvent will be able to dissolve a high concentration of salt , resulting in a high dielectric coefficient .",
    "a low solvent viscosity facilitates ionic transport.@xcite typically , cyclic carbonates like ec have a high dielectric constant , but also have high viscosity , while linear carbonates like emc have lower viscosity , but also a low dielectric constant .",
    "moreover , some organic liquids like ec have a melting point above room temperature , so that they are not liquids over the entire operating temperature range . in order to resolve these issues and optimize the viscosity , dielectric constant , and melting point of the electrolyte for battery performance , linear and cyclic carbonates are",
    "often mixed.@xcite ec is a commonly used liquid for mixed electrolytes since it is known to form a protective layer known as the solid electrolyte interphase ( sei)@xcite on graphitic anodes , which prevents excessive electrolyte decomposition and promotes reversible intercalation into and out of the anode .",
    "experiments have been conducted to examine the effect of the electrolyte composition on li transport and solvation using different spectroscopic techniques such as ftir,@xcite raman,@xcite nuclear - magnetic resonance ( nmr),@xcite electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy,@xcite neutron scattering,@xcite and x - ray diffraction.@xcite some of these experiments attempted to determine the coordination number around the li@xmath1 in using different li salts , solvents , and concentrations.@xcite reported coordination numbers in these works range from @xmath32 to 5 .",

    "both also used certain approximations , such as increased hydrogen masses and large time steps , to make the simulations more computationally feasible .",

    "statistical errors of the calculated values are on the order of @xmath23 @xmath5/s as shown in table  [ tab : lidiffusion ] or as much as 50% . improving these errors is nontrivial as it would require running many ( > 20 ) independent simulations with one li ion or a single simulation with many more li ions ( and correspondingly larger system size ) .",
    "values for ec are approximately a factor of two different than previous fpmd results@xcite which calculated the diffusion coefficient to be @xmath24 @xmath5/s at temperatures between 310450k , likely due to the large uncertainty associated with the short dft runs . the highest li diffusion is seen in emc .",
    "this is in agreement with experiments@xcite and classical simulations@xcite that find faster diffusion in linear carbonates compared to cyclic carbonates .",
    "surprisingly , the mixed electrolyte shows slower li@xmath1 diffusion than pure ec , whereas it would be expected to fall between ec and emc .",
    "we suspect the reason why the diffusion coefficient of the mixture does not fall between ec and emc is related to statistical error from the rather short dft simulation and the variation of solvation structure during the trajectory .",
    "however , we note that the similar solvation structures of li@xmath1 in ec and the ec / emc mixture result in similar diffusivities in these cases , which are distinct from that in pure emc . in fact , the first solvation shell of li@xmath1 in the ec / emc mixture can contain up to 2 ec molecules , as discussed above so it is expected that the value of the diffusion coefficient would be closer to that of pure ec .    .calculated li@xmath1 diffusion coefficients in each electrolyte , from the slope of the mean - square displacement ( msd ) and integral of the velocity autocorrelation function ( vacf ) . for each electrolyte , the most stable solvation configuration(s ) were considered .

    ", we used the reactive force field@xcite as implemented in the lammps@xcite software package to run much longer molecular dynamics trajectories of 1  ns with system sizes up to @xmath36400 atoms .",
    "first , we assessed the quality of the force field to reproduce the results of dft , using the ec electrolyte as a test case .",
    "these simulations were performed under nvt conditions using a nos - hoover chain thermostat with 3 nos - hoover chains and time step of 0.25  fs .",
    "the nos frequency was set to @xmath31333  @xmath9 corresponding to a period of @xmath325  fs . a system of 630 ec and 10 lipf@xmath2 molecules was equilibrated for 125  ps at 330  k followed by 1  ns of simulation time .",
    "this test system contained the same concentration of lipf@xmath2 as the dft simulation , but with 10 times more li ions to gather better statistics .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dftreaxff](a ) , we show the li ",

    "[ fig : dftreaxff](b ) , which illustrate how the 90@xmath21 angle from results in the ether oxygen atoms being closer to li@xmath1 than in the dft simulations .",
    "in addition , the second li  o peak in the pair correlation function from is much sharper than from dft , because this `` bent '' solvation structure is more rigid , presumably from additional interactions between li and o@xmath20 . in the dft simulations , the carbonyl dipoles of the ec molecules point toward the li@xmath1 , but",

    "this dimerization is inconsistent with dft and the chemical inertness of the ec liquid , but only occurs for less than 5% of the molecules over 1  ns .",
    "we further compared the diffusion coefficients for both li@xmath1 and pf@xmath0 and found that the values are within @xmath34050@xmath25 of the dft values .",

    "[ fig : time_size](a ) , these results are compared to the pair correlation function obtained when the entire 1 ns trajectory is used .",

    "we see that although the peak intensities vary slightly , the peak locations and the integral of the pair correlation function are comparable . these results were confirmed with several additional system sizes as well .",

    "we compared the diffusion coefficient for li@xmath1 and pf@xmath0 , calculated using the slope of the mean square displacement , from a 30  ps segment of the 630 ec + 10 lipf@xmath2 trajectory to that from the entire 1  ns trajectory .",
    "we found that using only 30  ps of the trajectory resulted in a difference of @xmath346@xmath25 for li@xmath1 and 38% for pf@xmath0 as opposed to using the whole 1 ns trajectory in the calculation .",
    "based on these results , we expect that our dft - calculated diffusion coefficients may vary up to 50@xmath25 by running longer simulations .",
    "classical simulations have also been used previously to study size effects , which found a 10@xmath25 difference in the diffusion coefficient between large ( 480 solvent molecules ) and small ( 240 solvent molecules ) box sizes.@xcite however , more li atoms were included in these simulations , which increased the statistical sampling and resulted in correspondingly smaller finite - size effects .",
    "we further compared the diffusion coefficients calculated from 1  ns trajectories of systems containing either 63 ec + 1 lipf@xmath2 or 630 ec + 10 lipf@xmath2 , to judge the effects of finite size without changing the statistical sampling .",
    "the diffusion coefficients between the smaller and larger systems differed by @xmath36@xmath25 for li@xmath1 , but up to @xmath348@xmath25 for pf@xmath0 .",
    "although the discrepancy for pf@xmath0 is fairly large , it is comparable with the approximately 50@xmath25 uncertainty we find for the time scale effects .",
    "tests on emc and the ec / emc mixture showed similar results as ec .",
    "to summarize , we find that the li@xmath1 solvation structures do not change significantly when assessing finite size and time scale effects , although there are some differences between the and dft solvation structures .",
    "furthermore , uncertainties up to @xmath350% in the diffusion coefficients are expected for simulations run at short time scales and smaller length scales .",
    "this uncertainty is still small enough to allow us to draw qualitative and semi - quantitative conclusions as above , given the relative statistical errors in our computed values .",
    "however , it will be important in the future to use dft at still larger length and time scales to further reduce uncertainties in solvation structures and diffusion coefficients .",
    "we found multiple possible solvation structures of li@xmath1 in each of the electrolytes studied here , including ethyl carbonate ( ec ) , ethyl methyl carbonate ( emc ) , and ec / emc mixture . while previous literature on ec and lipf@xmath2 has focused on solvation by 4 carbonyl oxygen atoms , we observed solvation structures that also include pf@xmath0 in the first solvation shell .",
    "we found that the preferred solvation structure is strongly dependent on the solvent . for ec",
    ", li@xmath1 prefers to be solvated by 4 carbonyl oxygen atoms and to remain dissociated from pf@xmath0 , while for emc it shows some preference for only 3 carbonyl oxygen atoms and to remain close to the pf@xmath0 . the 3:7 ec / emc mixture shows a preference for li@xmath1 to remain dissociated from pf@xmath0 , but has two energetically similar solvation structures where li@xmath1 is solvated either by 4 carbonyl oxygen atoms or by 3 carbonyl oxygen atoms and 1 ether oxygen atom . in all cases , li@xmath1 prefers to be solvated in a tetrahedral arrangement , though this does not rule out the possibility of a slightly higher - energy non - tetrahedral structure forming , as seen in the emc `` 4etherpf6 '' case .",
    "comparisons of solvation structures for li@xmath1 and pf@xmath0 reveal that li@xmath1 is more strongly solvated , associated with lower mobility in the electrolyte .",
    "calculations of first shell solvent molecule residence times show that there is a slight preference for pf@xmath0 to be solvated by ec over emc , although both show weak solvation of pf@xmath0 .    calculated diffusion coefficients quantify the ionic motion in each electrolyte and relate to the solvation structures .",
    "we find that the largest li@xmath1 diffusion coefficient occurs in emc .",
    "this is consistent with the measured viscosities of both organic solvents , and the diffusivity values obtained agree well with experimental values .",
    "the magnitude of the diffusion coefficient is largely influenced by how tightly the ion is solvated , for both li@xmath1 and pf@xmath0 . a more tightly bound solvation structure , such as for li@xmath1 in ec , leads to slower diffusion of the solvated ion .",
    "comparison of li@xmath1 and pf@xmath0 diffusion coefficients indicate that pf@xmath0 diffuses faster than li@xmath1 in all the electrolytes examined here , even though it is the heavier species .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that the solvent molecules interact more strongly with li@xmath1 than with pf@xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , we quantified finite size and time scale effects on the solvation structures and diffusion coefficients using .",
    "we find that solvation structures do not change significantly for larger system sizes and longer time scales than used here with dft , but there are some structural differences between and dft simulations .",
    "absolute diffusion coefficients are more affected by size and time scale effects , as uncertainties can be as large as 50% , but relative values remain consistent .    our work has shown that a more tightly bound solvation structure leads to slower diffusion , and a weakly bound solvation structure leads to faster diffusion . to improve the mobility of li ions in solution , our results suggest that li@xmath1 must have weak interactions with the organic solvent used in the electrolyte .",
