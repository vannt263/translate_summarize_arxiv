    "firm competition , one of the most basic market processes , has been famously discussed by adam smith  @xcite .",
    "two pioneering models by cournot and bertrand  ( * ? ? ? * ch .",
    "27 ) then described firm competition by quantity and price , respectively , and provided the first explanations of market behavior in their respective cases . in the bertrand model , consumers give absolute preference to the lowest price which consequently drives firm profits to zero .",
    "by contrast , the cournot model assumes that the offered products are homogeneous ( indistinguishable ) , derives the price from the aggregate quantity produced by all firms , and allows non - zero profits to be made . while it may seem obvious that bertrand competition is more beneficial for the consumers than cournot competition , this is not always the case  @xcite .",
    "firm competition models were later improved by modeling the consumer choice through a utility function which is maximized by each individual consumer and whose maximum then reflects the market s behavior .",
    "an example of this approach is provided by the classical dixit - stiglitz model of monopolistic competition  @xcite and an extensive line of work that it has inspired  @xcite .",
    "it soon became clear that a certain degree of price dispersion is present in real markets  @xcite and thus models building on the assumption of a unique price are insufficient .",
    "a market where both informed and uninformed customers are present was shown to lead to `` spatial '' price dispersion where some stores sell at a competitive price and others sell at a higher price  @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of `` temporal '' price dispersion where each store varies its price over time ( and thus prevents the customers from learning and distinguishing `` good '' and `` bad '' shops ) has been modeled in  @xcite .",
    "see  @xcite for an exhaustive review of work on price dispersion .",
    "however , even these models based on the economics of information  @xcite and the search of consumers for information in a market  @xcite are not entirely satisfactory because they assume that upon inspection , a consumer is able to exactly determine utility of a given product .",
    "we build on a market model where each product is endowed with intrinsic quality and each consumer with quality assessment ability ( in general , both quality and ability are continuously distributed over a certain range )  @xcite .",
    "the demand is generated by consumers , not imposed by firms .",
    "this model was shown to produce product differentiation where high - quality products target experienced consumers and low - quality products target the unexperienced ( or negligent ) ones  @xcite . while  @xcite deals with the case of heterogeneous consumers served by a monopolist firm , we now focus on homogeneous consumers served by multiple firms . by assuming that each consumer has a maximal price which they are willing to pay",
    ", we generalize this framework to include also product price in the consumer decision process .",
    "this allows us to model firm competition by product quality and price . with respect to other works",
    "where , typically , two consumer groups and two different product levels distinguished by quality or price are considered  @xcite , the current framework makes it possible to explicitly study the impact of consumer ability on the market equilibrium .",
    "it contributes to an extensive line of complex systems research which has helped to understand basic features of various systems in economics  @xcite , sociology  @xcite , and network science  @xcite .",
    "the rest of paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "basic ] , we introduce the framework and find the optimal strategy of a monopolist firm . in section  [ sec : homogeneous ] , we study the basic case of two homogeneous firms competing in the market , characterize the market ( nash ) equilibrium upon various strategies adopted by these firms , and show that firms can outperform the nash equilibrium . in section  [ sec : generalizations ] , we study three simple generalizations of the basic case : competition of several firms , competition of firms of different size , and the effect of unequal firm efficiency on the market . in section  [ sec : conclusions ] , we summarize the work and discuss the most important open questions and further research directions .",
    "we present here a probabilistic framework for consumer choice and firm profit which deviates from the framework studied in  @xcite by considering price sensitivity of consumers .",
    "the two basic characteristics of any product offered by a firm are its intrinsic quality @xmath0 and its price @xmath1 .",
    "the probabilistic behavior of the consumers is due to information asymmetry between them and firms which results in consumers being unable to assess quality of products with certainty .",
    "the three main assumptions of our framework are as follows :    1 .",
    "the firm s profit from each sold unit is assumed in the form @xmath2 .",
    "here @xmath1 represents the firm s income from selling the item and @xmath3 represents the cost necessary to produce a product of quality @xmath0 .",
    "the use of a different quality - cost relationship does not significantly alter the framework s behavior as long as the basic condition of monotonicity ( production cost grows with the product s quality ) holds .",
    "2 .   when offered a product of quality @xmath0 and price @xmath1 , the probability that a given consumer accepts the offer and purchases the product  a so - called `` acceptance '' probability  is @xmath4 here the first term reflects that there is a maximal price @xmath5 that the consumer can afford and the acceptance probability vanishes as @xmath1 approaches to @xmath5 .",
    "the second term reflects the consumer s evaluation of the product quality relative to the product price whereas @xmath6 is a parameter characterizing how experienced is the consumer .",
    "experienced consumers are able to assess the intrinsic product s quality and their acceptance probability is therefore substantial only when @xmath0 is close to @xmath1 ( they require value for their money ) which corresponds to @xmath6 being large .",
    "little experienced consumers are characterized by low @xmath6 and they are likely to accept also a product with bad @xmath7 ratio .",
    "plots visualizing the behavior of the acceptance probability given by eq .",
    "( [ p_a ] ) are shown in figure  [ fig : p_a ] .",
    "note that sec .",
    "[ appendix1 ] presents a more fundamental derivation of the acceptance probability .",
    "similarly , the value of @xmath5 can vary between the consumers and thus reflect their diverse budget constraints . to limit the scope of our present work",
    ", we leave the case of heterogeneous @xmath5 values and their impact on market equilibria for future study .",
    "we assume that a consumer facing multiple offers first selects one of them and then decides whether to purchase it or not .",
    "it is natural to require that the probability to select a given product ",
    "a so - called `` selection '' probability  grows with the product s quality and decrease with the product s price . since the acceptance probability @xmath8 has exactly these properties , we assume for simplicity that the probability of selecting a particular product is also proportional to @xmath9 .",
    "the separation of consumer decision into a selection step and an acceptance step implies that even when several distinct products are available , at most one of them will be purchased by a given consumer .",
    "while different functional forms can be chosen in each of these three points , our choice represents a simple and yet plausible way to model consumer behavior in a market .",
    "note that we omit a potential @xmath6-dependent multiplying factor in @xmath10 which was previously used in  @xcite to reflect the fact that consumers withs low @xmath6 may reject even a perfect ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath11 ) offer .",
    "since we study a homogeneous population of consumers here , this omission has no effect on the found market equilibria .",
    "we stress again that the use of consumer acceptance probability implies that demand is generated by consumers , not imposed by firms . on the other hand , quality and price",
    "are dictated by firms .",
    "this means that out of two classical competition models , that of cournot and bertrand  ( * ? ? ?",
    "27 ) , our framework is closer to bertrand competition .     for various values of @xmath6 : ( a ) fixed @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( @xmath0 where profit can be made thus runs from @xmath14 to @xmath15 ) , ( b ) fixed @xmath16 and @xmath13 ( @xmath1 where profit can be made thus runs from @xmath15 to @xmath17).,title=\"fig : \" ] +   for various values of @xmath6 : ( a ) fixed @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( @xmath0 where profit can be made thus runs from @xmath14 to @xmath15 ) , ( b ) fixed @xmath16 and @xmath13 ( @xmath1 where profit can be made thus runs from @xmath15 to @xmath17).,title=\"fig : \" ]    when there is only one firm in the market that offers a product of quality @xmath0 and price @xmath1 , rule 3 has no importance and the firm s profit is determined only by the acceptance probability and the profit per sold unit .",
    "firm profit per consumer is therefore @xmath18 where @xmath10 needs to be in general averaged over all consumers and their respective parameters @xmath6 and @xmath5 .",
    "assuming that all consumers are identical , we readily obtain @xmath19 when @xmath20 , this profit is zero because no consumer accepts the offer . when @xmath21 , the firm loses money with each sold item .",
    "we thus consider @xmath22 and @xmath23 as constraints for profit optimization .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ x1 ] ) is a slight generalization of the profit function in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "4 ) where it was implicitly assumed that @xmath24 ( _ i.e. _ , experienced consumers are willing to pay high price ) .",
    "the current form with two parameters , @xmath6 and @xmath5 , makes it possible to model a broader range of consumer behavior than the previous one .",
    "firms strive to optimize their profit . in the case of one monopolistic firm facing consumers with quality - recognizing ability @xmath6 and maximal price @xmath5 , profit - maximizing product parameters and the maximal profit per consumer are @xmath25 subscripts denote that these results apply to the case with one firm .",
    "one can see that these results are proportional to @xmath5 ; this parameter thus not only determines the economically profitable range for @xmath1 and @xmath0 but also the optimal price and quality levels .",
    "the same optimal price , quality , and total profit are achieved by several firms acting in the market in collusion .",
    "constrained profit optimization where , for some reason , either quality or price are fixed can be studied as well but we do not report their detailed results here .      when there are two firms in the market , each offering their own products with quality values @xmath26 and price levels @xmath27 , we use the above - described two - step consumer decision process which was first proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the process consists of two steps : a consumer first selects which product they prefer most ( the selection step ) and then decides whether to actually buy it or not ( the acceptance step ) .",
    "similarly as the second step is described by the acceptance probability @xmath28 , the first step is described by a so - called selection probability @xmath29 of selecting the product of firm @xmath30 .",
    "as explained before , we assume for simplicity that the selection probability is proportional to @xmath31 .",
    "the proportionality constant is given by normalization of this probability ( _ i.e. _ , exactly one product must be selected by each consumer ) .",
    "this approach to the description of the demand of individual consumers facing discrete choices has been used extensively in the past  @xcite .",
    "the above - described example is easily generalizable to the case of @xmath32 firms . denoting the quality and price values of the offered products as @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively",
    ", the selection probability becomes @xmath35 in summary , the per - consumer profit of firm @xmath30 which offers a product with quality @xmath36 and price @xmath37 reads @xmath38 where the selection step , the acceptance step , and the marginal profit from each sold item are combined together . as we shall see in the following section , the introduction of several firms in the market creates a rich system where various game - theoretic concepts apply .",
    "we now proceed to study the behavior of our market model in the presence of two homogeneous firms ( _ i.e. _ , firms sharing all important characteristics such as size and production costs ) . to maximize their profit , both firms attempt to adjust quality and price of their products in such a way that their own profit is maximized",
    "the situation where both quality and price are the same as in the case of a monopolist firm is therefore inherently unstable : each firm can increase the profit by unilaterally altering quality and price of its product .",
    "this would be naturally followed by an analogous move on the competitor s side .",
    "the sequence of mutually - provoked adjustments would eventually settle in a configuration where neither side can improve its profit by a unilateral move which is of course the classical nash equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "the combined profit of the firms is expected to decrease by competition with respect to the monopolist ( or non - competitive ) case .",
    "since there is no reason why quality and price values should differ between the two firms , the nash equilibrium values @xmath39 and @xmath40 must be the same for both firms .",
    "these values can be found by requiring that an infinitesimal change by one firm leaves the firm s profit unchanged @xmath41 which must hold up the first order in @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "this is naturally equivalent to @xmath44 at @xmath45 .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ xn ] ) , the market equilibrium can be readily found in the form @xmath46 where subscripts denote that the results relate to the case of two competing firms and the superscripts denote that the results represent the nash equilibrium .",
    "it is interesting to note that while product price is _ always _ lowered by competition , product quality can go either way .",
    "the quality ratio @xmath47 which is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : n_firms]a , is greater than one only for @xmath48 .",
    "similarly , one can compare the resulting profit of each firm with @xmath49 which is achieved when the two firms do not compete and keep quality and price at the levels corresponding to those of a monopolist firm .",
    "the ratio of profit with and without competition , a so - called profit ratio , is for us the key quantity to evaluate the effect of competition on the system . in the given case of two firms competing by both quality and price",

    "this is due to the initial optimal setting @xmath58 $ ] which is , when @xmath6 is high , close to the optimal price @xmath59 and thus the marginal profit @xmath60 is small .",
    "price decrease due to competition , if not compensated by a quality decrease , would therefore lead to a negative marginal profit .",
    "the optimal firm response to competition is thus to decrease both price and quality . by contrast ,",
    "when @xmath6 is small , the difference between @xmath57 and @xmath61 is large which makes quality improvement due to competition possible .     of firm 2 as a function of @xmath6 under four distinct competition strategies .",
    "]    it is instructive to study a particular situation where there are two firms in a market and firm @xmath15 decides to decrease price of its product in order to maximize its profit ( product quality is fixed either for production reasons or because of the firm s decision ) .",
    "firm @xmath17 then has four different response strategies : do nothing , adjust price , adjust quality , and finally adjust both price and quality .",
    "we focus again on the nash equilibrium where neither of the firms can improve its profit .",
    "the resulting profit ratio of firm @xmath17 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : firm2 ] as a function of @xmath6 ( the analytical results are too complicated to be shown here ) .",
    "as expected , the first response ( do nothing ) is the worst one and the last one ( adjust both @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) is the best one .",
    "one can note that in the current setting , price competition is more effective than quality competition for all values of @xmath6 .",
    "this is a general statement which holds also when it is assumed that firm @xmath15 has decided to compete by improving product quality or by adjusting both quality and price .",
    "the reason lies in the profit formula eq .",
    "( [ x1 ] ) which implies that customers are always price - sensitive but their quality sensitivity vanishes as @xmath62 .",
    "this is also the reason why for @xmath63 , results achieved by firm 2 with price adjustment are almost as good as those achieved with quality and price adjustment .",
    "the nash equilibrium is a natural competition outcome for two firms focusing solely on maximizing each own s profit given the other firm s strategy .",
    "however , the present framework is richer than that .",
    "we now consider the case of two firms : while the sole goal of firm 1 is profit optimization , firm 2 is farsighted and does not always try to improve at the expense of its competitor .",
    "the motivation for this `` lack '' of competition is that firm 2 knows that even when its profit could be improved by a particular change of strategy , the realization of this change would provoke a strategy adjustment by firm 1 and both firms would eventually end with less profit than before .",
    "to model this mechanism , we assume that the farsighted firm 2 chooses the quality and price of its product and keeps it fixed regardless of what does the optimizing firm 1 .",
    "we consider a simple one - dimensional parametrization @xmath64 which allows firm 2 to continuously adjust between the optimal monopolist behavior ( when @xmath65 ) and the nash equilibrium of two firms ( when @xmath66 ) . the strategy @xmath67 of firm 1 is chosen as an optimal response to the strategy of firm 2 .",
    "profit of both firms is given by eq .",
    "( [ xn ] ) .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : beyond ] , labeling firm 2 as farsighted is indeed appropriate because this firm can outperform the nash equilibrium profit over a wide range of @xmath68 values .",
    "the optimal outcome is achieved by @xmath69 which is significantly different from @xmath70 corresponding to the classical nash equilibrium .",
    "the disadvantage of the farsighted approach is that it brings far more benefit to the competing firm 1 which is able to take advantage of the lack of competition on the side of firm 2 .",
    "finally , the figure shows also the outcome of the farsighted firm confronted with a firm adopting the nash equilibrium position .",
    "as expected , the farsighted approach yields no extra profit in this case and @xmath71 has a unique maximum at @xmath70 .",
    "this demonstrates that the improved profit of the farsighted firm can be realized by lowering the level of competition in the market .",
    "when at least one firm competes fiercely by adopting the nash equilibrium position regardless of the other market participants actions , no profit improvement is possible .",
    "the example of a farsighted firm illustrates that firm strategies other than profit maximization , which are very natural to study in the present framework , should not be neglected .    .",
    "the horizontal dashed line denotes the nash profit ratio . while the farsighted firm can improve over the nash - equilibrium solution over a wide range of @xmath68 ( solid line ) , the optimizing firm benefits more ( dash - dotted line ) . ]",
    "without attempting to be exhaustive , we now discuss three illustrative cases which contribute to the understanding of how customer ability and firm competition affect the market equilibria .",
    "many other modifications and generalizations are possible , some of which are mentioned in conclusions .",
    "the treatment presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : homogeneous ] can be easily repeated for @xmath53 competing firms , one of which may attempt to increase its profit by adjusting quality and price of its product .",

    "the ratio of @xmath74 and @xmath57 is @xmath75 which is greater than one only for @xmath76 ( one can see that as the number of competing firms increases , this threshold decreases to the limit value of @xmath77 ) .",

    "we stress that @xmath82 is a relative change of profit which already takes the indirect reciprocity with respect to the number of firms into account .",
    "the absolute profit of each firm naturally goes to zero as the number of firms increases : because of competition driving prices down and quality up , but mainly because of splitting the total pie among more participants . to conclude",
    ", we show there also the marginal profit @xmath55 which quantifies firm profit per sold item and further shows that while competition does not drive marginal profit to zero , increasing consumer ability does .",
    "lines representing results for @xmath83 are shown in fig .",

    "( [ xn ] ) implicitly treats both firms as equal  based on quality and price of their products , they both enter in the selection probability and consequently also in the profit equation in exactly the same way .",
    "we now generalize this framework by accounting for the case where the visibility of firms differ because of , for example , their different size or different advertising expenditures . since the two usually go hand in hand ( big companies have more resources for advertising ) , we refer here to a difference in firm size . while there are multiple ways of introducing firm size in the system",
    ", we study only the simplest one where firm sizes are exogenous variables which are independent of current firm turnovers and profits ( see the concluding section for a further discussion of this issue ) .",
    "if the relative size of firms 1 and 2 are @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively , we generalize the probability of a consumer choosing firm 1 over firm 2 to the form    @xmath86    the probability of considering the product of firm 2 is complementary , @xmath87 .",
    "it is straightforward to repeat the previous analysis and study the nash market equilibrium in this case . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : small_firm]a , the small firm can improve its profit by competing with the big one ( _ i.e. _ , by adjusting the quality and price of its product ) .",
    "the limit value of @xmath84 below which firm 1 can improve its profit by competition varies little with @xmath6 . in the case of competition by both quality and price , for example , this threshold decreases from @xmath88 for @xmath89 to @xmath90 for @xmath91 and @xmath92 for @xmath93 .",
    "note that while firm 1 can improve its profit only until certain firm size @xmath84 , the relative decrease of its profit due to competition is always smaller than that of the big firm 2 ( due to its greater size , the absolute loss of profit of firm 2 is further magnified with respect to the absolute loss of profit of firm 1 ) .",
    "the small firm thus always has the possibility to hurt the big firm by competition more than it does hurt itself .",
    "factors not included in our analysis , such as the volume of firm reserve funds and possible long - term strategic considerations , determine whether firm 1 is ultimately interested in this kind of rivalry or not .",
    "the limit case of a negligibly small firm ( @xmath94 ) is easy to be treated analytically and leads to the optimal strategy @xmath95 where @xmath96 .",
    "since firm 1 is assumed to be negligibly small here , the optimal strategy of firm 2 is that of a monopolist firm . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : small_firm]b , the profit ratio of the small firm , @xmath97 , is substantially greater than one for any @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) . inspecting the small firm s optimal strategy given in eq .",
    "( [ ps_small ] ) more closely , we find that it is based on a considerable price cut and a corresponding quality adjustment which is positive for @xmath100 ( corresponding to @xmath101 ) and negative for @xmath102 ( this is the same behavior as we have seen before for @xmath74 which was also greater than @xmath57 only for small @xmath6 ) .",
    "one can similarly study the situation where one small firm enters a market with two firms in the nash equilibrium  the small firm again achieves higher profit by competing than by `` friendly '' adopting the quality and price level set by its greater rivals . the relative profit improvement of the small firm is then smaller than the values reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : small_firm ] .",
    "this reduced possible profit is given by @xmath39 and @xmath40 leaving less space for the benefit of a third firm than @xmath57 and @xmath61 leave for a second firm .",
    "up to now , we always assumed that the marginal profit of each firm is @xmath2 .",
    "we now generalize it to the form @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a firm - specific parameter which gives us the possibility to model the effect of unequal firm efficiency on the market .",
    "in particular , we assume @xmath105 to be the default ( starting ) value which however can be lowered by , for example , optimization of productions processes or by innovations .",
    "all other things being equal , smaller @xmath104 implies smaller production cost @xmath106 and thus higher marginal profit @xmath103 . one can note that while the upper bound on product price remains to be @xmath5 , the upper bound on product quality becomes @xmath107 which grows as @xmath104 decreases",
    "the impact of increased efficiency is therefore two - fold : reduction of the production cost and increase of the maximal economically profitable quality of products .",
    "we study the effect of efficiency on the market on a particular case of two competing firms which are initially homogeneous as they both have @xmath105 .",
    "when firm 1 makes progress and achieves @xmath108 , the market equilibrium ceases to be symmetric ( in general , the optimal quality of firm 1 is higher than that of firm 2 ) . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : efficiency ] , the impact on firm profit is particularly strong when @xmath6 is high .",
    "this is because a market with experienced consumers are characteristic by a small marginal profit @xmath109 . changing the marginal profit to @xmath110 thus results in its substantial relative increase which is in turn followed by an update of the optimal strategy by both firms .",
    "the asymmetry between profit changes of the two firms ( firm 1 gaining more than firm 2 looses ) is not surprising as it reflects an increase of the aggregate profit which is an expected effect of efficiency improvements .",
    "we have generalized our previously - introduced probabilistic framework for consumer choice based on quality assessment  @xcite in order to include price sensitivity of consumers and used it to model firm competition in a market .",
    "thanks to this generalization , we have been able to study three different types of competition ( by quality , by price , and by both quality and price ) and their impact on the market .",
    "when several firms compete in a market , it is natural to study the resulting nash equilibrium where no firm can increase its profit by adjusting properties ( quality or price ) of its product . within our framework ,",
    "product price in the nash equilibrium is always decreased by competition but product quality can go either way : it increases when consumer ability is low and decreases when consumer ability is high .",
    "in addition to the nash equilibrium , we find that if one firm employs a less aggressive strategy , it can outperform the nash - optimal profit which is based on the assumption of strict profit maximization by all market participants .",
    "while profit of each individual firm naturally goes to zero as the number of firms grows , their total profit does not vanish due to competition regardless of consumers ability .",
    "vanishing marginal profits , a classical result of bertrand competition , are recovered only in the limit of infinitely experienced consumers ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "this kind of competition is a natural consequence of each firm s attempt to improve its own position which , however , ultimately leads to each firm earning less ( similarly as the classical prisoner s dilemma leads to inferior outcome for both prisoners  @xcite ) .",
    "we find the situation to be different when the competing firms are of a different size .",
    "a small firm may even improve its profit by entering in competition with a big firm : the big firm facing a small competitor adjusts the quality and price of its product less than the small firm does which makes a profit increasing - solution possible for the small firm .",
    "the present framework is very elementary , yet it allows for generalizations reflecting various aspects of firm competition in an economy . for example , if multiple firms and multiple groups of consumers with distinct properties are present ( as studied in  @xcite ) , is it better for each firm to produce one product or is it nash - stable that each firm produces multiple products  one per each consumer group",
    "? there are also research questions that require more substantial modifications of the present framework .",
    "the present static framework where firms coexist and their sizes ( represented by @xmath84 and @xmath111 in eq .",
    "( [ ps_small ] ) ) are fixed .",
    "assuming that the current firm s profit ( or turnover ) influences the firm s size , the system suddenly gains a temporal dimension and allows one to study effects such as dynamic equilibria , the growth and decay of firms , and the effect of efficiency improvements and innovations in such a dynamical setting . including the economies of scale has the potential to make the range of produced phenomena even richer .",
    "further insights on which model modifications are indeed crucial and which are not , as well as evidence in support of the basic model , can be gained by attempts to calibrate the present market models on real economic data .",
    "we have simplified the consumer decision process by assuming that each consumer is characterized by one single parameter ",
    "quality assessment ability @xmath6which then applies to any available product . in reality , however , consumer attention and other resources required for the choice of products are often limited .",
    "this limitation is particularly relevant in the nowadays society where there is a multitude of products to choose from  @xcite .",
    "this can be reflected by endowing each consumer with a limited amount of resources which can be then divided among the available products and spent on their assessment .",
    "it is then natural to study questions such as the optimal division of resources and , consequently , the impact of limited consumer attention on the outcome of firm competition in a market .",
    "while it is possible to interpret our consumer decision framework as a purely phenomenological model , we now lay out microscopic foundations for the acceptance probability @xmath112 which is central to the whole framework .",
    "we assume that an available product is characterized by its intrinsic quality @xmath0 and price @xmath1 .",
    "a consumer who evaluates this product is characterized by standard deviation @xmath113 of perceived product quality @xmath114 which , for the sake of simplicity , is assumed to follow the normal distribution @xmath115 .",
    "it is a plausible assumption that the consumer accepts the product only if @xmath114 exceeds product price @xmath1 .",
    "the acceptance probability can be shown to have the form @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the standard error function .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : appendix ] , the behavior of this acceptance probability is similar to that of @xmath112 defined by eq .  ( [ p_a ] ) .",
    "this behavior is recovered over a broad range of underlying assumptions ( for example , when additive errors are replaced with multiplicative ones ) . in this paper , we have chosen to study power - based acceptance probabilities because of their simple form which allows us to obtain analytical results .",
