    "recent observations of the two @xmath0-ray bursts ( grbs ) grb  970228 and grb  970508 have allowed unprecedented progress in our understanding of their sources , due to the fact that x - ray and optical counterparts have now been identified ( costa  1997a ,  b ; heise  1997 ; piro  1997 ; van paradijs  1997 ; sahu  1997 ; galama  1997a ; bond 1997 ; djorgovski  1997a ; and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , the discovery of an extended source which _ may be _ the host galaxy of grb  970228 ( van paradijs  1997 ; sahu  1997 ) , and the detection of an absorption- and emission - line system at @xmath3 in the optical spectrum of grb  970508 ( metzger  1997a ,  b ) , which may arise from a host ( or intervening ) galaxy , provide ( if the identification of the sources is correct ) the first direct evidence that grbs are at cosmological distances .",
    "however , there does remain one serious difficulty with the cosmological hypothesis , namely , the claim that a significant proper motion has been measured for grb  970228 from hst images ( caraveo  1997a , b ) .",
    "we discuss this issue in some detail .",
    "in addition , although the x - ray , optical and radio afterglows of the grbs 970228 and 970508 are consistent with the cosmological fireball models ( wijers , rees , and mszros 1997 ; waxman 1997 ; vietri 1997 ; and see  2.1 ) , little progress has been achieved towards the identification of the actual mechanism causing the bursts . we discuss some of the implications of the neutron - star merger scenario , and show that the predicted @xmath2 relation from this model is consistent with the observations .",
    "the optical counterpart of grb  970508 was first identified by one of us ( bond 1997 ) , observing at kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) on the 0.9-m reflector with a @xmath4 ccd camera which provides a field of view of @xmath5 . upon notification of the occurrence of the @xmath0-ray burst by j.  halpern ,",
    "bond obtained ccd frames beginning at 1997 may 9.131 , only 5.5  hours after the burst .",
    "however , as the grb counterpart was well below the limits of the stsci digitized sky survey , its actual identification was delayed until the following night , may 10 , when it was then readily recognized as a variable source by blinking the frames from both nights .",
    "( plate  1 ) shows the discovery frames from may 9 and 10 .",
    "the variable star - like object at the center of each panel is the proposed grb counterpart , which brightened by about 1 mag over the one - day interval . the frames , obtained in the standard johnson @xmath6 and kron - cousins @xmath7 bandpasses , were corrected for atmospheric extinction and calibrated using 14 standard stars from landolt ( 1992 ) .",
    "table  1 presents the 0.9-m photometry , with @xmath8 errors calculated from the photon statistics using iraf s _ qphot _ routine . in fig .  2 we plot the data from table  1 .",
    "the errors are relatively large on may  9 , due both to the faintness of the source and to the relatively short exposures ( 120 to 600  s ) . on may  10 , however , the precision of the observations is sufficient to reveal brightening of the source from one frame to the next .",
    "the principal features of the grb afterglow at x - ray and optical wavelengths are well represented by a forward - radiating , blast - wave model of mszros and rees ( 1997 ) with only four adjustable parameters , as shown in fig .  3a . in their model a1",
    "those parameters are : the peak flux , @xmath9 ( which is independent of photon energy ) , the continuum power - law photon indices @xmath10 and @xmath11 for photon energies less than and greater than , respectively , the peak flux density , and the duration of the @xmath0-ray burst , @xmath12 .",
    "values of the parameters which represent the afterglow of grb 970508 are @xmath13  jy , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 ( fig .",
    "3a ) . for this value of @xmath11",
    "the remnant fades as @xmath17 .",
    "the values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 accord well with those expected for synchrotron emission by relativistic electrons in a blast wave ( mszros and rees 1997 ) , and the fitted value of @xmath12 matches well the observed duration of the @xmath0-ray burst : 15  s ( costa  1997c ) , or fwhm = 3.6  s and total duration = 35  s ( kouveliotou  1997 ) .",
    "the @xmath0-ray and x - ray brightness of the burst exceed the peak flux density of the afterglow by a factor @xmath18 ( fig .",
    "this is probably a consequence of the fact that the @xmath0-rays and the afterglow are produced at different stages of the fireball evolution ( the grb is produced before the self - similar stage ; waxman 1997a , b ) .",
    "however , this model represents two general characteristics of the optical afterglow : the wavelength dependence of the fading optical afterglow ( @xmath19 d ) , and the absence of wavelength dependence at earlier times .",
    "but the model does not match ( in detail ) the temporal evolution before peak brightness .",
    "the optical brightness before peak can be approximated with @xmath20 , although the optical brightness before peak would then be predicted to be wavelength dependent , which is contradicted by observations .",
    "we therefore prefer the @xmath21 fit .    a more detailed comparison between the model presented in fig",
    ".  3a and the optical observations is shown in fig .",
    "the ratio of observed and modeled flux densities are wavelength independent both before and after peak brightness ( @xmath22 d ) . before peak",
    "the observed flux density rises rapidly from approximately 5 times fainter than predicted ( see however waxman 1997b ) to agreement with the model .",
    "resolution of this discrepancy during the early phase of the afterglow may require intensive , rapid observations of new grb counterparts .",
    "generally speaking , given the simplicity of the model and the small number of adjustable parameters , the agreement with x - ray , optical and ( to some extent ) radio observations should be considered remarkable ( see also wijers  1997 ; vietri 1997 ; waxman 1997a , b ) .",
    "this strengthens considerably the identification of the optical counterparts of both grb 970228 and grb 970508 .",
    "it is beyond the scope of the present paper to discuss the complex behavior of grb 970508 in the radio wavelengths ( frail et al , 1997 ) .",
    "we have undertaken an extensive analysis of the hst optical images of grb  970508 ( see also pian  1997 ) , in an attempt to detect an unambiguous signature of an underlying host galaxy ( as suggested by the line strengths and the line - strength ratios of the mg  i / mg  ii absorption system and the [ o  ii ] emission line ; metzger 1997a ,  b ) . to this end",
    ", we have used the most updated dark frames ; and an average point spread function ( psf ) constructed from the stars in the observed field of the grb ( rather than from the archive ) which , within the uncertainties , is indistinguishable from the psf derived for the grb .",
    "our analysis suggests that the limit quoted by fruchter  ( 1997 ) is rather conservative , and we find that if a host galaxy is underlying the grb ( with an angular extent of about 05 ) , it must be fainter than @xmath1 @xmath23 ( or else it is extremely compact with an angular extent of less than about 02 , which at @xmath3 corresponds to @xmath24  kpc ) . to confirm this result",
    ", we did the following exercise : we took the galaxy ( size @xmath25 07@xmath2609 ) with r @xmath25 24.8 at about 56 ne of the grb ( djorgovski et al .",
    "1997d ) , artificially made it fainter by different factors , superposed the result on the grb , and checked whether the galaxy is still detectable .",
    "the galaxy is clearly detected when its magnitude is @xmath1 @xmath25 25.5 , but barely so at r@xmath25 26 , after the proper psf subtraction .",
    "note that this process not only adds the galaxy but also adds the sky noise , so even this method gives a conservative limit to the detectable magnitude .",
    "since the redshift is 0.8 , this implies that an underlying galaxy , if present , is at least 10 times fainter than an l@xmath27 galaxy .",
    "grb 970228 was observed with hst wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) in ` wide-@xmath6 ' and ` @xmath7 ' filters on 1997 march  26 and april  7 .",
    "the telescope roll angles during the two epochs of observation differed by about 2.3982 ( for full details of the observations see sahu  1997 ) . on the basis of these observations caraveo  ( 1997a , b ) reported that the point source moved 0016 towards the south east over this 12-day interval .",
    "if correct , such a proper motion would imply a galactic origin for this grb . here",
    "we present a detailed independent analysis of any possible proper motion .    for the proper - motion analysis , it is important to correct for cosmic - ray ( cr ) and hot - pixel effects in the images .",
    "the standard stsci pipeline calibration typically uses dark frames taken a few days prior to the observations , and therefore may not remove all the hot pixels efficiently .",
    "consequently , we have re - calibrated the images ourselves , starting with the raw , uncalibrated images , and using the dark frames taken closest ( within one day ) to the actual observations .",
    "the bias subtraction , flat - field correction and cr - rejection were carried out in the usual way .",
    "since there are refractive elements in the optics , color terms could play a role in the image positions .",
    "therefore the analysis was done for the @xmath6 and @xmath7 images separately , giving independent proper - motion information in the two bands .",
    "two of the @xmath6 images had crs close to the grb image , and they were therefore treated with special care .",
    "specifically , we carried out two analyses , one with the cr - affected ( and cr - corrected ) images included , and one where we simply discarded the cr - affected images .",
    "( crs and their rejection cause loss of information in the affected pixels ; thus discarding such images may be the preferred procedure .",
    ") there are 4 reference stars ( marked in fig .",
    "4 ) in the pc chip whose colors and brightness imply that their expected parallaxes and proper motions are orders of magnitude smaller than the measurement uncertainties .",
    "the centroids of the stars were determined using 2-dimensional gaussian fits .",
    "the positional accuracy for the stars is typically 2 to 3 milliarcsec in each coordinate at each epoch , while for the relatively faint grb it is @xmath254 milliarcsec ( corresponding to a  proper - motion \" uncertainty of @xmath256 milliarcsec in each coordinate ) .",
    "the measured coordinates were then corrected for the camera s geometric distortion using the gilmozzi  ( 1995 ) and holtzman  ( 1995 ) solutions ( these give identical results to within 0.5 milliarcsec , and slightly differ only at the edge of the field ) . a linear transformation from the first epoch to the second",
    "was then performed , using the 4  reference stars and assuming zero mean motion .",
    "this was done with 2 different methods : one where the rotation and the translation were done separately , and the other where they were done in a single step .",
    "the first method involves using the program ` metric ' in the stsdas package , which first takes the rotation into account ( from the roll - angle information in the header ) in converting the pixel coordinates to ra and dec . the centroids of the stars are determined in ra and dec , and a linear translation from the first to the second epoch is then performed as a separate step . in the second method ,",
    "the centroids are determined in pixel coordinates taking only the geometric distortion of the detector into account , and a transformation from the first to the second epoch is then made taking the rotation and translation as a single step .",
    "both methods , however , gave almost identical results ( to within 1 milliarcsec ) , which shows that the telescope roll angle infomation in the header has sufficient precision for this analysis .",
    "the resulting  proper motions \" for the 4 stars and the grb are shown in fig .  5 for v and i filters separately .",
    "as can be seen , the positions of the reference stars are within the expected uncertainties , which shows that the transformations have been done correctly .",
    "the grb displays a  proper motion \" relative to the reference stars of about 0007 in the nw direction in the cr - free @xmath6-band images , and about 00065 in the same direction in the @xmath7-band , the uncertainties being of comparable magnitude to the motion .",
    "the fact that the observed shift is not significantly larger than the measurement errors , coupled with the fact that the grb is faint and embedded in a nebulosity , lead us to conclude that no proper motion has been detected ( within the uncertainties ) .",
    "our result disagrees with the findings of caraveo ( 1997 ) , both in magnitude and in the direction of motion , for the @xmath6-band images .",
    "no comparison is possible for the @xmath7-band since they do not quote a value for these images .",
    "while a generic fireball model (   paczyski and rhoads 1993 ; rees and mszros 1997 ) appears consistent with all the available data , the same can not yet be said about any specific mechanism for the production of the fireball . in the following we examine several aspects of neutron - star mergers ( see also sahu  1997 , and references therein ) in light of the recent observations and theoretical developments .",
    "neutron - star mergers in close - binary systems have been suggested as a promising mechanism for the production of fireballs ( , eichler  1989 ; narayan , paczyski , and piran 1992 ) .",
    "population synthesis calculations which take into account the evolution of the entire binary population of a galaxy , (  tutukov and yungelsson 1994 ) predict that the frequency of mergers should peak at about @xmath28  yr following a burst of star formation .",
    "consequently , we can use recent findings on the cosmic history of star formation to predict the redshift distribution of neutron - star mergers , and thereby of grbs , if such mergers indeed represent the correct model for their origin .    using the hubble deep field ( williams  1996 ) in conjunction with ground - based observations , madau  ( 1996",
    "; see also madau 1996 , 1997 ) were able to show that the cosmic star - formation rate sfr(z ) peaked at @xmath29 .",
    "given the short delay time of @xmath25 3 @xmath26 10@xmath30 yr , we therefore _ predict _ that the rate of neutron - star mergers should roughly follow the sfr(z ) of madau  ( 1997 ) ( even delays of up to @xmath31  yr are hardly noticeable within the uncertainties ) .",
    "furthermore , since much of the star formation may be occurring in small , low - mass galaxies that experience short starbursts ( , babul and rees 1992 ; babul and ferguson 1996 ) , we _ predict _ that , if grbs are produced by neutron - star mergers , they may originate _ preferentially _ in such galaxies .    we have checked whether this strongly non - uniform redshift distribution ( madau 1997 ) is compatible with the observed @xmath32 relationship for grbs ( where @xmath33 is the number of bursts with peak flux greater than p[photons @xmath34 s@xmath35 ) . we have used a standard candle luminosity distribution function for a range of luminosities @xmath36 erg@xmath37  s@xmath37 ( 100 - 500 kev ) , a power - law photon spectrum with index @xmath38 , and friedmann cosmology with @xmath39 and @xmath40 = 50  .",
    "the synthetic @xmath2 distribution functions thus obtained are presented in fig .",
    "6 . also presented in fig .",
    "6 is the distribution function observed with the pioneer venus orbiter ( pvo ) and the compton gamma - ray observatory burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) ( fenimore  1993 , fenimore and bloom 1995 ) . a reasonable representation of the observed distribution",
    "is found for @xmath41  erg@xmath42 .",
    "thus density evolution that follows the madau  sfr function and a single peak grb luminosity are consistent with the observations .",
    "we would like to stress that if neutron - star mergers are the correct model for grbs , then their redshift distribution can provide _ an independent test _ for the cosmic history of the sfr .",
    "another issue that should be addressed in relation to neutron - star mergers is that of  kicks \" that are required for the formation of the neutron - star binaries as inferred , for example , from observations of radio pulsars ( , lyne and lorimer 1994 ) and low - mass x - ray binaries ( white and van paradijs , 1996 ) .",
    "in particular , fryer and kalogera ( 1997 ) find that the formation rate of double neutron - star systems with separations that are smaller than @xmath43 ( a fraction of which are the candidates for mergers within a hubble time ) peaks at kick velocities of 200  .",
    "furthermore , fryer and kalogera find _ minimum _ center - of - mass velocities of 200  and 225  for the two double neutron - star systems psr  1913 + 16 and 1534 + 12 ( respectively ) .",
    "since the escape velocity from small galaxies is of order 100   ( , gallagher , hunter , and tutukov  1984 ) , neutron - star binaries with center - of - mass velocities 200  would easily escape from such host galaxies .",
    "the hst observations of grb  970228 ( sahu  1997 ) are consistent with such an interpretation , since the observed point source lies about 03 south of the center of the extended source ( which may be the host galaxy ) .",
    "no host galaxy has been detected yet for grb 970508 ( see  2 ) .",
    "the hst image , however , shows two nearby faint galaxies , at transverse distances of @xmath44  kpc and 35  kpc ( for @xmath3 , @xmath45 65  ) from the point source . a neutron - star binary moving at @xmath46  ( away from a low - mass galaxy ) for about @xmath47  yr could reach a distance of @xmath48  kpc . however , the ratio of the mg  i / mg  ii lines and the strength of these lines , and in particular the reported [ o  ii ] emission line ( metzger 1997a ,  b ) argue for the presence of a host galaxy at the grb location .",
    "we conclude that if a host is not found ( even after the grb fades away ) , an interpretation associating the grb with one of the faint galaxies will have to be re - examined .",
    "in such a case , one would probably have to argue that the [ o  ii ] emission is produced by a nebula in the vicinity of the grb itself , in a similar manner to the production of emission lines from the ring around sn  1987a ( , sonneborn  1997 ) .",
    "one test for such an interpretation would be to spectroscopically monitor grb  970508 , since the strength of the line would then be expected to change , as in the case of sn  1987a .",
    "we are grateful to p.  madau and e.  fenimore for useful discussions .",
    "we acknowledge the help of colin cox with the geometric distortion correction of the hst images , and ray lucas and others in the scheduling division for efficiently scheduling the observations of grb 970228 .",
