    "the relevance of spatial and other kinds of heterogeneity in the design of immunization strategies has been widely addressed in the epidemic modeling of infectious diseases @xcite . in particular , it has been pointed out that population inhomogeneities can substantially enhance the spread of diseases , making them harder to eradicate and calling for specific immunization strategies .",
    "this issue assumes the greatest importance in a wide range of natural interconnected systems such as food - webs , communication and social networks , metabolic and neural systems  @xcite .",
    "the complexity of these networks resides in the small average path lengths among any two nodes ( small - world property ) , along with a large degree of local clustering . in other words , some special nodes of the structure",
    "develop a larger probability to establish connections pointing to other nodes .",
    "this feature has dramatic consequences in the topology of scale - free ( sf ) networks @xcite which exhibit a power - law distribution @xmath0 for the probability that any node has @xmath1 connections to other nodes . for exponents in the range",
    "@xmath2 , this connectivity distribution implies that , for large network sizes , the nodes have a statistically significant probability of having a very large number of connections compared to the average connectivity , @xmath3 .",
    "this feature contrasts with what is found for homogeneous networks ( local or nonlocal ) in which each node has approximately the same number of links , @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the extreme heterogeneity of sf networks finds the most stunning examples in two artificial systems , the world - wide - web ( www ) @xcite and the internet @xcite . along with these technological networks , it has also been pointed out that sexual partnership networks are often extremely heterogeneous @xcite , and it has been recently observed that the network of sexual human contacts possesses a well - defined scale - free nature @xcite .    in homogeneous networks , an epidemic occurs only if the rate of infection of `` healthy '' individuals connected to infected ones exceeds the so - called _ epidemic threshold _ ; in other words , if the disease can not transmit itself faster than the time of cure , it dies out  @xcite . in heterogeneous networks , on the other hand , it is well - known that the epidemic threshold decreases with the standard deviation of the connectivity distribution  @xcite .",
    "this feature is paradoxically amplified in scale - free networks which have diverging connectivity fluctuations .",
    "in fact , as it was first noted in refs .",
    "@xcite , epidemic processes in sf networks do not possess , in the limit of an infinite network , an epidemic threshold below which diseases can not produce a major epidemic outbreak or the inset of an endemic state . sf networks are therefore prone to the spreading and the persistence of infections , whatever virulence the infective agent might possess .    in view of this weakness , it becomes a major task to find optimal immunization strategies oriented to minimize the risk of epidemic outbreaks on sf networks , task with immediate practical and economical implications .",
    "this paper presents a parallel comparison of the effect of different immunization schemes in the case of two different complex networks : the watts - strogatz model @xcite and the barabsi and albert model @xcite .",
    "the first is a homogeneous network exhibiting small - world properties , while the second one is the prototype example of sf network . by studying the susceptible - infected - susceptible model @xcite in presence of progressively greater immunization rates , we find that uniformly applied immunization strategies are effective only in complex networks with bounded connectivity fluctuations . on the contrary , in sf networks",
    "the infection is not eradicated even in the presence of an unrealistically high fraction of immunized individuals .",
    "actually , sf systems do not have any critical fraction of immunized individuals and only the total immunization of the network achieves the infection s eradication . in order to overcome these difficulties we define optimal immunization strategies that rely on the particular sf structure of the network .",
    "the developed strategies allow us to achieve the total protection of the network even for extremely low fractions of successfully immunized individuals .",
    "in order to estimate the effect of an increasing density of immune individuals in complex networks , we will investigate the standard susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) model  @xcite .",
    "this model relies on a coarse - grained description of individuals in the population .",
    "namely , each node of the graph represents an individual and each link is a connection along which the infection can spread . each susceptible ( healthy ) node is infected with rate @xmath5 if it is connected to one or more infected nodes .",
    "infected nodes are cured and become again susceptible with rate @xmath6 , defining an effective spreading rate @xmath7 ( without lack of generality , we set @xmath8 ) .",
    "the sis model does not take into account the possibility of individuals removal due to death or acquired immunization @xcite , and thus individuals run stochastically through the cycle susceptible @xmath9 infected @xmath9 susceptible .",
    "this model is generally used to study infections leading to endemic states with a stationary average density of infected individuals .",
    "a wide class of network models @xcite have exponentially bounded connectivity fluctuations .",
    "a paradigmatic example of this kind of networks that has recently attracted a great deal of attention is the watts - strogatz ( ws ) model @xcite , which is constructed as follows : the starting point is a ring with @xmath10 nodes , in which each node is symmetrically connected with its @xmath11 nearest neighbors .",
    "then , for every node each link connected to a clockwise neighbor ( thus @xmath12 links for each node ) is kept as originating from the original node and rewired to a randomly chosen target node with probability @xmath13 .",
    "this procedure generates a random graph with a connectivity distributed exponentially for large @xmath1 , and an average connectivity @xmath14 .",
    "it is worth remarking that even in the case @xmath15 the network keeps the memory of the construction algorithm and is not equivalent to a random graph .",
    "in fact , by definition each node emanates at least the @xmath12 links which have been rewired from the clockwise neighbors to randomly chosen nodes ; a property that affects also the clustering properties of the graph ( for details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    for the class of exponentially bounded networks , one can generally consider that each node has roughly the same number of links , @xmath16 , and therefore we can consider them as fairly homogeneous in their connectivity properties . at a mean - field level ,",

    "( [ eq : ws ] ) considers infected nodes becoming healthy with unit rate .",
    "the second term represents the average density of newly infected nodes generated by each active node .",
    "this is proportional to the infection spreading rate @xmath19 , the number of links emanating from each node @xmath16 , and the probability that a given link points to a healthy node , @xmath20 $ ] . after imposing the stationary condition @xmath21 , the most significant and general result is the existence of a nonzero epidemic threshold @xmath22 @xcite such that @xmath23 in other words , if the value of @xmath19 is above the threshold , @xmath24 , the infection spreads and becomes endemic .",
    "below it , @xmath25 , the infection dies out exponentially fast .",
    "the existence of an epidemic threshold is a general results in epidemic modeling , present also in different models such as the susceptible - infected - removed ( sir ) model @xcite . in analogy with critical phenomena",
    "@xcite , this kind of behavior can be identified as an absorbing - state phase transition , in which @xmath26 plays the role of the order parameter in the phase transition and @xmath19 is the tuning parameter , recovering the usual mean - field behavior @xcite .",
    "this standard framework is radically changed in the class of sf networks @xcite , in which the probability distribution that a node has @xmath1 connections has the form @xmath27 and the connectivity fluctuations , @xmath28 , diverge in infinite networks for any value @xmath29 .",
    "the paradigmatic example of sf network is the barabsi and albert ( ba ) model @xcite .",
    "the construction of the ba graph starts from a small number @xmath30 of disconnected nodes ; every time step a new vertex is added , with @xmath31 links that are connected to an old node @xmath32 with probability @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the connectivity of the @xmath32-th node .",
    "after iterating this scheme a sufficient number of times , we obtain a network composed by @xmath10 nodes with connectivity distribution @xmath35 and average connectivity @xmath36 . for this class of graphs ,",
    "the absence of a characteristic scale for the connectivity makes highly connected nodes statistically significant , and induces strong fluctuations in the connectivity distribution which can not be neglected . in order to take into account these fluctuations",
    ", we have to relax the homogeneity assumption used for homogeneous networks , and consider the relative density @xmath37 of infected nodes with given connectivity @xmath1 ; i.e. , the probability that a node with @xmath1 links is infected .",

    "the creation term considers the probability that a node with @xmath1 links is healthy @xmath39 $ ] and gets the infection via a connected node .",

    "the presence of immunization depresses the infection s prevalence too slowly , and it is impossible to find any critical fraction of immunized individuals that ensures the infection eradication .",

    ", we can study the system by looking at the infection s prevalence in the stationary regime ( endemic state ) as a function of the immunity @xmath75 . the uniform immunization is implemented by randomly selecting and immunizing @xmath93 nodes on a network of fixed size @xmath10 .",

    "1(a ) , we show the behavior of the reduced prevalence @xmath100 ( where @xmath101 is the prevalence without immunization ) as a function of the uniform immunization @xmath75 in the ws network .",

    ", we observe the presence of a sharp immunization threshold @xmath102 , in fair agreement with the estimate @xmath103 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gcws ] ) with the values @xmath94 and the estimate @xmath104 from ref .  @xcite . in the biological case ,",
    "this effect motivates the use of global vaccination campaigns in homogeneous populations in order to reach a density of immune individuals that secures from major outbreaks or endemic states . on the contrary , the results for the sf network , depicted in fig .",
    "2(a ) , show a strikingly different behavior .",
    "namely , the density of infected individuals decays slowly with increasing immunization , and it would be null only for the complete immunization of the whole network ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "specifically , it follows from eq .",
    "( [ op ] ) that the sis model on the ba network shows for @xmath105 and any @xmath19 the prevalence @xmath106 we have checked this prediction in fig .",
    "in other words , the infection always reaches an endemic state if the network size is enough large ( see fig .",
    "this points out the absence of an immunization threshold ; sf networks are weak in face of infections , also after massive uniform vaccination campaigns .",
    "when fighting an epidemic in an heterogeneous population with a uniform vaccination scheme , it is necessary to vaccinate a fraction of the population larger than the estimate given by a simple ( homogeneous ) assumption @xcite . in this case",
    ", it can be proved @xcite that _ optimal _ vaccination programs can eradicate the disease vaccinating a smaller number of individuals .",
    "sf networks can be considered as a limiting case of heterogeneous systems and it is natural to look for specifically devised immunization strategies .      a straightforward way to reintroduce an intrinsic immunization threshold in sf networks consists in using different fractions of immunized individuals according to their connectivity .",
    "let us define @xmath107 as the fraction of immune individuals with a given connectivity @xmath1 .",
    "if we impose the condition @xmath108 we observe that eqs .",
    "( [ mfk ] ) become identical and decoupled , defining effectively an homogeneous system .",
    "the density of infected individuals is the same for all connectivities @xmath1 , and an epidemic threshold @xmath109 is reintroduced in the system .",
    "this condition requires that @xmath110 is constant for all groups of connectivity @xmath1 at the threshold , implying that @xmath111 ; i.e. , a larger portion of individuals must be immunized in groups with larger connectivity . in this scheme",
    "the total density of immunized individuals can be easily calculated by averaging @xmath107 over the various connectivity classes .",
    "the fraction of non - immunized individuals @xmath112 can not be larger than one , thus we focus only on classes with connectivity such that the reproductive number @xmath113 . to eradicate the infection , we need that @xmath114 in all classes with connectivity @xmath115 , defining the critical fraction of immunized individuals as @xmath116 in order to perform an explicit calculation for the ba model , we use again the continuous @xmath1 approximation @xcite . in this case we obtain that @xmath117 this result can be readily extended to sf networks with arbitrary @xmath74 values , and it is worth remarking that this recipe is along the lines of that introduced in the immunization of heterogeneously populated groups @xcite .",
    "recently , a similar strategy has been put forward in ref .",
    "@xcite by proposing to cure with proportionally higher rates the most connected nodes .",
    "while proportional immunization schemes are effective in finally introducing an well - defined immunization threshold , the very peculiar nature of sf networks allows to define more efficient strategies based on the nodes hierarchy .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that sf networks posses a noticeable resilience to random connection failures  @xcite , which implies that the network can resist a high level of damage ( disconnected links ) , without loosing its global connectivity properties ; i.e. , the possibility to find a connected path between almost any two nodes in the system .",
    "at the same time , sf networks are strongly affected by selective damage ; if a few of the most connected nodes are removed , the network suffers a dramatic reduction of its ability to carry information @xcite . applying this argument to the case of epidemic spreading",
    ", we can devise a _ targeted _ immunization scheme in which we progressively make immune the most highly connected nodes , i.e. , the ones more likely to spread the disease . while this strategy is the simplest solution to the optimal immunization problem in heterogeneous populations @xcite ,",
    "its efficiency is comparable to the uniform strategies in networks with finite connectivity variance . in sf networks , on the contrary",
    ", it produces an arresting increase of the network tolerance to infections at the price of a tiny fraction of immune individuals .",
    "let us consider the situation in which a fraction @xmath75 of the individuals with the highest connectivity are successfully immunized .",
    "this corresponds , in the limit of a large network , to the introduction an upper threshold @xmath118 , such that all nodes with connectivity @xmath119 are immune .",
    "the fraction of immunized individuals is then given by @xmath120 relation that renders @xmath118 an implicit function of @xmath75 .",
    "the presence of the cut - off @xmath121 defines the new average quantities @xmath122 and @xmath123 , which are on their turn function of @xmath75 . at the same time , all links emanating from immunized individuals can be considered as if they were removed . the probability @xmath124 that any link will lead to an immunized individual is then given by @xmath125 and if we consider that this fraction @xmath124 of links are effectively removed , the new connectivity distribution after the immunization of a fraction @xmath75 of the most connected individuals is @xcite : @xmath126 the new distribution ( after cut - off introduction and link removal ) yields the first two moments @xmath127 and @xmath128 @xcite . by recalling eq .",
    "( [ thr ] ) , the critical fraction @xmath79 of immune individuals needed to eradicate the infection will be given by the relation @xmath129 an explicit calculation for the ba network in the continuous @xmath1 approximation yields that the density of immunized nodes is related to the connectivity threshold as @xmath130 by inverting this relation we obtain that the connectivity threshold is @xmath131 , yielding that @xmath132 as well , we can obtain @xmath133 and @xmath134 as @xmath135 . by inserting these values into eq .",
    "( [ th_targ ] ) we obtain the approximate solution for the immunization threshold in the case of targeted immunization as @xmath136 this clearly indicates that the targeted immunization program is extremely convenient in sf networks where the critical immunization is exponentially small in a wide range of spreading rates @xmath19 .",
    "also in this case , the present result can be generalized for sf networks with arbitrary connectivity exponent @xmath74 .    in order to test the targeted immunization scheme",
    "we have implemented numerical simulations of the sis model on the ws and ba networks by immunizing the @xmath137 nodes with the highest connectivity .",
    "note that , for a given network , this method is essentially deterministic : once we identify the hierarchy in the node s connectivity distribution , we proceed to protect those nodes on top of the list .",
    "simulations are performed at a fixed spreading rate @xmath94 . in fig .",
    "1(a ) we report the behavior of the prevalence of infected nodes for the ws network with targeted immunization ; the results corresponding to the ba graph are plotted in fig .",
    "in the case of the ws network , the behavior of the prevalence as a function of @xmath75 is equivalent in the uniform and targeted immunization procedures .",
    "the connectivity fluctuations are small , and the immunization of the most connected nodes is equivalent to the random choice of immune nodes .",
    "this confirms that targeted strategies do not have a particular efficiency in systems with limited heterogeneity . on the contrary ,",
    "in the case of the ba network , we observe a drastic variation in the prevalence behavior .",
    "in particular , the prevalence suffers a very sharp drop and exhibits the onset of an immunization threshold above which no endemic state is possible ( zero infected individuals ) .",
    "a linear extrapolation from the largest values of @xmath75 yields an estimate of the very convenient threshold @xmath138 .",
    "this definitely shows that sf networks are highly sensitive to the targeted immunization of a small fraction of the most connected nodes ( see fig .",
    "2(a ) and fig .",
    "3(b ) ) . while these networks are particularly weak in face of infections , the good news consist in the possibility to devise immunization strategies which are extremely effective .",
    "the present results indicate that the sf networks susceptibility to epidemic spreading is reflected also in an intrinsic difficulty in protecting them with local  uniform  immunization . on a global level ,",
    "uniform immunization policies are not satisfactory and , in analogy with disease spreading in heterogenous media , only targeted immunization procedures achieve the desired lowering of epidemic outbreaks and prevalence .",
    "this evidence radically changes the usual perspective of the regular epidemiological framework . spreading of infectious or polluting agents on sf networks , such as food or social webs ,",
    "might be contrasted only by a careful choice of the immunization procedure . in particular , these procedures",
    "should rely on the identification of the most connected individuals .",
    "the protection of just a tiny fraction of these individuals raises dramatically the tolerance to infections of the whole population    a practical example is provided by the spreading of viruses in the internet @xcite .",
    "the sf nature of this network is the outcome of a connectivity redundancy which is very welcome because it ensures a greater error tolerance than in less connected networks . on the other hand , despite the large use of anti - virus software which is available on the market within days or weeks after the first virus incident report , the average lifetime of digital epidemics is impressively large ( 10 - 14 months ) @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of the sis model on real maps of the internet can provide further support to our picture .",
    "the sis model is , in fact , well suited to describe dns - cache computer viruses  @xcite ( the so - called `` natural computer viruses '' ) , and different digital viruses can be modeled by considering the random neighbor version of the model  @xcite ) ; i.e. infected e - mails can be sent to different nodes which are not nearest neighbors .",
    "the map considered here , provided by the national laboratory for applied network research ( nlanr ) and available at the web site http://www.moat.nlanr.net/routing/rawdata/ , contains @xmath139 nodes and @xmath140 links , corresponding to an average connectivity @xmath141 .",
    "the connectivity distribution is scale - free , with a characteristic exponent @xmath142 @xcite .",
    "our simulations are performed at a fixed spreading rate @xmath94 , averaging over at least @xmath143 different starting configurations .",
    "we implement both the uniform and the targeted immunization procedures .",
    "the results obtained clearly indicate that the behavior is completely analogous to that found on the ba network .",
    "4 illustrates that , while uniform immunization does not allow any drastic reduction of the infection prevalence ",
    "the immunization of @xmath144 of the nodes reduces by less than a factor @xmath145 the relative prevalence ",
    "the targeted immunization drastically removes the occurrence of endemic states even at very low value of the immunization parameter .",
    "the fact that sf networks can be properly secured only by a selective immunization , points out that an optimized immunization of the internet can be reached only through a global immunization organization that secures a small set of selected high - traffic routers or internet domains .",
    "unfortunately , the self - organized nature of the internet does not allow to easily figure out how such an organization should operate .",
    "the present results also appear to have potentially interesting implications in the case of human sexual disease control @xcite .",
    "most sexually transmitted diseases can not be characterized without including the noticeable differences of sexual activity within a given population .",
    "epidemic modeling is thus based on partitioning population groups by the number of sexual partners per unit time @xcite .",
    "this implicitly corresponds to the knowledge of the probability distribution function @xmath61 that gives the fraction of the population within the @xmath1 class .",
    "the recent observation that the web of human sexual contacts exhibits scale - free features @xcite points out that also sexually transmitted diseases are eventually spreading in a network with virtually infinite heterogeneity .",
    "it follows that concepts such as the mean number of sexual partners or its variance are not good indicators in this case .",
    "as well , the definition of a core group of `` super - spreader '' individuals could be a non well - defined concept because of the lack of precisely defined thresholds or characteristic magnitudes in the scale - free distribution of sexual contacts .",
    "nevertheless , the striking effectiveness of targeted immunization indicates that control and prevention campaigns should be strongly focused at the most promiscuous individuals .",
    "these represent the most connected nodes of the network and are thus the key individuals in the spreading of the infection .",
    "while the simple sis model is very instructive , many other ingredients should be considered in a more realistic representation of real epidemics @xcite .",
    "one would also want to add simple rules defining the temporal patterns of networks such as the frequency of forming new connections , the actual length of time that a connection exists , or different types of connections .",
    "these dynamical features are highly valuable experimental inputs which are necessary ingredients in the use of complex networks theory in epidemic modeling .",

    "<S> this peculiar connectivity provides an ideal environment for the spreading of infective agents . </S>",
    "<S> here we show that the random uniform immunization of individuals does not lead to the eradication of infections in all complex networks . </S>",
    "<S> namely , networks with scale - free properties do not acquire global immunity from major epidemic outbreaks even in the presence of unrealistically high densities of randomly immunized individuals . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of any critical immunization threshold is due to the unbounded connectivity fluctuations of scale - free networks . </S>",
    "<S> successful immunization strategies can be developed only by taking into account the inhomogeneous connectivity properties of scale - free networks . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , _ targeted _ immunization schemes , based on the nodes connectivity hierarchy , sharply lower the network s vulnerability to epidemic attacks . </S>"
