    "the phase transition of the systems in the universality class of the two- dimensional ( 2d ) @xmath0-@xmath1 model , known as the kosterlitz - thouless - berezinskii ( or some permutation of this ) transition ( berezinskii 1971 ; kosterlitz and thouless 1973 ; kosterlitz 1974 ) , is a fascinating one . and ,",
    "even though the basic details of this transition were worked out in the early 1970 s , interest in this transition remains keen with more than 200 articles published yearly on the topic .",
    "indeed , one can find references to the  ktb \" transition in the literature on topics ranging from layered materials ( such as the high - temperature superconductors ( htsc s ) ) to superfluid films .",
    "given its wide - spread importance , an understanding of the kosterlitz - thouless - berezinskii transition and the derivation of its critical behavior properties is essential for a student of condensed matter and statistical physics .",
    "renormalization group ( rg ) techniques ( wilson 1971 ) are also an important tool for a theoretical physicist and can be used for a variety of problems in a number of ways .",
    "[ for example , see the article by n. andrei in this same issue . ]",
    "it was originally applied to the 2d @xmath0-@xmath1 model by kosterlitz ( 1974 ) to study its critical behavior . in this paper",
    ", we will review his real - space rg analysis of the 2d @xmath0-@xmath1 model , describe the quintessential properties of the critical behavior , and discuss recent results on layered superconductors derived using the same mathematical formulation .",
    "falling into the universality class of the 2d @xmath0-@xmath1 model are 2d superconductors and superfluids as well as 2d two - component magnetic systems .",
    "more generally , one can say that this universality class covers 2d systems with a two - component order parameter .",
    "systems in this universality class are believed to undergo the kosterlitz - thouless - berezinskii phase transition . in this section",
    ", we will show how the 2d @xmath0-@xmath1 model can be mapped to the 2d coulomb gas and then review kosterlitz s rg study of that system which illuminates many of the principal features of the critical behavior .",
    "( for pedagogical arguments of the phase transition see kosterlitz et al . , 1973 or halperin ( 1979 ) .",
    ") the rg study culminates in the 2d recursion relations which can be used to derive the temperature dependence of the correlation length . in the last subsection",
    "we will describe how ktb behavior can be detected in superconducting films via electronic transport measurements .",
    "one might guess that the physics of the 2d @xmath0-@xmath1 model is uninteresting since it has been shown that there is no long - range order at finite temperature in magnetic systems ( mermin and wagner 1966 ) nor in superfluids ( hohenberg 1967 ) .",
    "yet hints of novel behavior were provided by stanley and kaplan ( stanley and kaplan 1966 ) who found a divergence of the susceptibility based on a high- temperature series expansion .",
    "wegner ( wegner 1967 ) went on to show that the susceptibility was infinite at low temperatures .",
    "further suggestions of a phase transition were provided by berezinskii ( berezinskii 1971 ) who found a power- law decay of the spatial correlation function at low temperatures while others had ascertained the exponential decay at high temperatures .",
    "it was kosterlitz and thouless ( kosterlitz and thouless 1973 ) who formulated the transition explicitly in terms of vortices and , to be more precise , as a vortex / anti- vortex pair unbinding transition .",
    "in this zero - field transition , vortices are created spontaneously in pairs at finite temperatures and have an energy which goes as the logarithm of their separation . as the temperature increases , the vortex pairs increase in size and in density .",
    "as this happens , screening of their interactions becomes important and enables a phase transition at a temperature @xmath2 .",
    "at this temperature two things happen : vortex pairs start to unbind and spontaneous creation of single free vortices becomes possible .",
    "being driven by topological excitations is one of the properties of this transition that makes it so unique .",
    "another is its correlation length which diverges according to an exponential rather than a power - law at @xmath2 . as we will explain , it is this latter property that makes detection of this phase transition difficult to detect by thermodynamic measurements because there is no singularity in the free energy .",
    "evidence for the transition can be accumulated however through electronic transport measurements for the case of superconductors .",
    "the 2d @xmath0-@xmath1 model is defined by the hamiltonian : @xmath3 where @xmath4 are all nearest - neighbor spins and @xmath5 is the angle that the spin vector @xmath6 makes with an arbitrary axis . in the low temperature and continuous limit",

    "we now proceed to express eq .",
    "( [ 2dcontxy ] ) in terms of the energy for a 2d coulomb gas .",
    "this is accomplished ( halperin 1979 ) by first splitting the angle @xmath9 into two parts , @xmath10 , corresponding to a _",
    "v_ortex part and a _ s_pin _ w_ave part where @xmath11 @xmath12 this substitution leads to three terms in eq .",

    "( [ total ] ) contain the spin wave terms and the energy associated with the vortex core energies .",

    "rg incorporates the essential idea of scaling and extends it .",
    "scaling says that near a second order phase transition , one length scale , the correlation length , dominates the critical behavior and all other length scales are thrown out .",
    "rg does not eliminate the short length scales altogether as scaling does , but incorporates their contribution into the renormalization of the system parameters .",
    "there are two steps in an rg analysis : the first is to course - grain the system which amounts to taking out the small - scale structure and incorporating it into a renormalization of the parameters of the system .",
    "this can be done both in real space and in momentum space .",
    "( wilson and kogut 1974 ) . the second step is to rescale the system so that the infrared cutoff is restored to its original value .",
    "the connection to the physics of the system is achieved by studying how the parameters of the system change as one goes through the rg iterations .",
    "the relationship between the old values and the `` renormalized '' values are called recursion relations . for a thorough description of the renormalization group , the reader should consult any of the many textbooks on the subject ( e.g. binney , dowrick , fisher , and newman 1995 ; or ma 1976 ) .",
    "below we sketch the details of the real space renormalization group study of the 2d coulomb gas ( kosterlitz 1974 ) . a manuscript containing the complete details of this rg analysis and the derivation of the recursion relations is available from the author .",
    "the reader is also encouraged to see any of the excellent reviews of the ktb transition ( halperin 1979 ; minnhagen 1987 ; suzuki 1979 ) .",
    "the first step in the rg calculation is to integrate out small scale structure . in our case",
    ", this amounts to increasing the minimum separation between the vortices @xmath48 to @xmath52 and determining the effect of the vortex pairs with a separation in that range on the interactions of other vortices .",

    "this increase marks the onset of unbinding of vortex pairs at the larger separations and the spontaneous creation of free vortices .",

    "2b . for temperatures less than @xmath2",
    ", @xmath100 decreases due to the screening of vortex pairs but saturates at a finite value .",
    "the length scale at which it saturates corresponds to the length beyond which vortex pairs with the corresponding separation are negligible .",

    "this is in contrast to the @xmath118 case where one can see that @xmath100 does not saturate but decreases to zero .",
    "this is because vortices are present at all length scales .",
    "in fact , it is not just @xmath100 that changes but also the logarithmic dependence of the interaction energy due to free vortices . for further information ,",
    "see the discussion by minnhagen ( 1987 ) .",
    "an intriguing consequence of the ktb temperature dependence is that there is no singularity in the free energy of this system . using a scaling analysis",
    ", one finds that the singular part of the free energy density scales as @xmath122 which is analytic as @xmath123 . the specific heat and the magnetization , both thermodynamic derivatives of the free energy , are also analytic at the critical temperature leaving detection of this transition difficult .",
    "in superconducting films , it is primarily through electronic transport measurements that ktb critical behavior is verified . here",
    "we will briefly sketch the arguments leading to the current - voltage characteristics and the temperature dependence of the resistance @xmath124 . in the presence of a current ,",
    "a force ( whose magnitude is linear with current and whose sign is opposite for vortices and anti- vortices , ) is exerted on a vortex in a direction perpendicular to the current .",
    "free vortices can therefore dissipate energy . the resistance in the limit of zero current should be proportional to the density of free vortices which in turn is inversely proportional to the square of the correlation length : @xmath125 minnhagen ( 1987 ) has generalized this formula to include the effects of the underlying superfluid to obtain @xmath126 $ ] where @xmath127 is the mean - field transition temperature .",
    "the effect of a current on a pair is to pull them apart with a force which is independent of their separation .",

    "we now proceed to discuss the layered system .",
    "in this section , the model and techniques of section [ sec : model ] are generalized to a weakly coupled layered system .",
    "the various properties of the critical behavior of vortices in layered systems deduced using the methods reviewed above will be emphasized but it should be noted that many authors ( chattopadhyay and shenoy 1994 ; fischer 1993 ; friesen 1995 , horovitz 1991 ; korshunov ; 1990 ) have made significant contributions to the field using other approaches .",

    "when the correlation length becomes larger than the interlayer separation , the behavior should be 3d .",

    "can determine the functional dependence of @xmath142 on the interlayer coupling to find ( pierson 1995a ) @xmath172 in agreement with the results of hikami and tsuneto ( 1980 ) . by comparing the correlation length to the 2d correlation length , insights into the size of the 3d critical region can be found .",
    "one will find that sufficiently far from @xmath142 the two correlation lengths are nearly identical which is interpreted to mean that the layered system behaves two - dimensionally in that region .",
    "closer to @xmath142 however there is a slow bifurcation which is taken to indicate crossover to the 3d region and the size of this region can be studied as a function of @xmath145 .",
    "it is convenient to divide the 3d temperature window into two parts , one above @xmath142 : @xmath173 , and one below @xmath142 : @xmath174 .",
    "it is found ( pierson 1995a ) that while @xmath175 has the same logarithmic dependence on @xmath145 as previously found for @xmath147 , @xmath173 differs markedly : @xmath176 a power - law dependence on @xmath145 was also found subsequently by friesen ( 1995 ) : @xmath177 the anisotropy of the 3d behavior around @xmath142 is dramatic as evidenced not only by the different dependences on @xmath145 but also by the magnitude difference above and below the transition temperature ( pierson 1995a ) .",
    "this anisotropic behavior is attributed to the importance of the vortex fluctuations above @xmath142 which screen out both the interlayer and intralayer coupling .",
    "how the system crosses over the 3d to 2d behavior can also be addressed ( pierson 1995c ) by studying eq .",
    "( [ rrrc ] ) , the recursion relation for @xmath145 . below @xmath142 where @xmath97 is small",
    ", @xmath145 grows to the isotropic value .",
    "this means that as the size of the vortex pairs becomes larger , 3d effects become more important . above @xmath142 ,",
    "@xmath145 grows initially but then starts to decrease at larger length scales due to vortex screening represented in the term proportional to @xmath178 .",
    "the length scale at which @xmath179 peaks is the interlayer screening length @xmath180 and it is found to get larger as one lowers the temperature towards @xmath142 presumably diverging there as the intralayer screening length ( i.e. the correlation length ) does .",
    "the implication of this for the nature of 3d to 2d crossover is that the layer decoupling occurs first at the largest length scales just above @xmath142 and then proceeds to smaller length scales as the temperature is increased . as a consequence , the interaction between two vortices in neighboring layers separated by a distance larger than @xmath180 will be strongly screened giving the effect of decoupled layers .",
    "the linear ( or 3d - like ) interaction between two vortices in the same layers separated by a distance larger than interlayer screening length will also be screened resulting in the same effect .",
    "the screening of 3d effects at large length scales has interesting effects on the effective dimensionality of vortices where the 3d effects are felt primarily at those same lengths ( pierson 1995c ) .",
    "an analysis of the finite current recursion relations has also shown to be fruitful ( pierson 1995b ) . by comparing the correlation length to the zero current correlation length and the 2d correlation length",
    ", one finds that there are three characteristic currents .",
    "the smallest @xmath181 is the current that marks the onset of resistance .",
    "it corresponds to the minimum current needed to overcome the josephson attraction to allow vortex pair unbinding .",
    "the next characteristic current @xmath182 is where the phase transition occurs and above which free vortices can be spontaneously created .",
    "the largest characteristic current @xmath183 is the 3d/2d crossover current .",
    "the temperature dependencies of these characteristic currents have been examined and are found to be predominantly linear . while @xmath181 is linear at larger currents , it crosses over to join @xmath182 at small currents converging to the same point at @xmath142 .",
    "these three currents map out a phase diagram in @xmath136-@xmath38 space .",
    "the properties of electronic transport properties in each region of the @xmath136-@xmath38 phase diagram are discussed by the author ( pierson 1995b ) . it should be stressed that @xmath181 and @xmath183 are crossover currents while @xmath182 is a phase transition .",
    "in this paper , we have reviewed the critical behavior of the 2d @xmath0-@xmath1 model universality class with an emphasis on the derivation of the recursion relations through a renormalization group analysis .",
    "we reviewed the derivation of the temperature dependence of the correlation length and the methods of verifying the transition in superconductors .",
    "finally those methods were generalized to a layered superconductor system where the vortex interactions are modified due to the josephson coupling between the layers .",
    "the power and usefulness of the real space rg method become readily apparent here as evidenced by the calculation of a number of important properties of the critical behavior including the dependence of the transition temperature and the size of the 3d critical region on the strength of the interlayer coupling .",
