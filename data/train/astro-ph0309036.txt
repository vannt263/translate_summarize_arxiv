    "present - day cluster ellipticals are a remarkably well - behaved class of objects , with structural and chemical properties obeying simple power - law scaling relations . but",
    "this could not always have been the case in a hierarchical universe . while most galaxy formation models can be tuned to reproduce these relations at @xmath10 , a more stringent test lies in reproducing their evolution with redshift .",
    "to this end , it is important to study rich clusters out to the highest redshifts , when fractional age differences among the galaxies were proportionately greater . in recent years",
    ", deep wide - field optical surveys and deep serendipitous x - ray surveys have uncovered significant numbers of rich galaxy clusters to redshift unity and beyond ( see reviews by postman 2002 ; rosati 2003 ) .",
    "these most distant , and most massive , of known gravitationally bound structures can then be studied in detail through targeted , high - resolution , follow - up optical and near - infrared observations .",
    "we have undertaken a survey of rich galaxy clusters in the redshift range @xmath11 using the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ; ford et  al .",
    "2002 ) on the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) .",
    "the aim of this survey is to establish new constraints on the cluster formation epoch and the evolution of early - type galaxies .",
    "the first cluster observed , rdcs1252.92927 ( hereafter rdcs1252 ) at @xmath12 ( rosati 2003 ; rosati et  al .",
    "2003 ) , was discovered as part of the rosat deep cluster survey ( rosati et  al .",
    "1998 ) and is among the highest - redshift galaxy clusters with spectroscopic confirmation .",
    "this letter presents the first results from our acs cluster survey , focusing on the color - magnitude ( cm ) relation of the early - type galaxies in rdcs1252 .",
    "we adopt the best - fit wmap cosmology : @xmath13 ( bennett et  al .",
    "2003 ) , giving a scale of 8.4 kpc per arcsec at @xmath12 .",
    "rdcs1252  was observed in the f775w and f850lp bandpasses ( hereafter i_775@xmath14  and z_850@xmath15 , respectively ) with the acs wide field camera as part of the guaranteed time observation program ( proposal 9290 ) during 2002 may and 2002 june .",
    "the observations were done in a @xmath16 mosaic pattern , with 3 and 5 orbits of integration in i_775@xmath14  and z_850@xmath15 , respectively , at each of the four pointings .",
    "there was nearly 1  of overlap between pointings ; thus , the core of cluster was imaged for a total of 12 orbits in i_775@xmath14and 20 orbits in  z_850@xmath15 .",
    "the data were processed with the `` apsis '' pipeline described by blakeslee et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) , with some recent updates .",
    "in particular , we used a version of the drizzle software ( fruchter & hook 2002 ) supplied by r.hook that implements the `` lanczos3 '' interpolation kernel ( a damped sinc function ) .",
    "this kernel produces a sharper point spread function ( psf ) and greatly reduces the noise correlation of adjacent pixels and the resulting `` moire '' patterns .",
    "apsis also now removes discontinuities in the residual bias level at the amplifier boundaries , producing a more uniform background .",
    "an earlier processing of these images has been used by bouwens et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) for a study of the faint i_775@xmath14  dropout population at @xmath17 .",
    "we calibrate our photometry to the ab system using photometric zero points of 25.640 ( i_775@xmath14 ) and 24.843 ( z_850@xmath15 ) .",
    "these are uncertain at the @xmath40.02 mag level , which has no effect on our conclusions .",
    "we adopt a galactic reddening for this field of @xmath18mag based on the schlegel et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) dust maps .",
    "figure[fig : cluscenter ] shows the central @xmath19 region of a color composite made from our reduced i_775@xmath14  and z_850@xmath15  images .",
    "a red galaxy population is clearly visible .",
    "the central pair of galaxies are separated by 18 ( 15kpc ) and are each of magnitude @xmath20 .",
    "we used sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) in `` dual - image mode '' with low threshold and deblending settings to find objects in the reduced images and perform the initial photometry .",
    "sextractor `` mag_auto '' values were used for the total magnitudes .",
    "the ( i_775-z_850)@xmath1  color effectively separates out evolved galaxies at @xmath21 , and the cluster is obvious as a central concentration of galaxies with @xmath22 .",
    "figure1b [ removed from the apjl version in order to meet the page limit ] shows histograms of isophotal color within 3 different radii of the cluster center ( defined midway between the two central galaxies ) for galaxies with total @xmath2325 mag .",
    "we selected an initial sample of 312 nonstellar objects with @xmath24 , in the broad isophotal color range @xmath25 , and inside a radius of 192 .",
    "our goal is to study the early - type galaxy population in rdcs1252 , for which we have limited spectroscopic data , and these cuts are designed to select the vast majority of our target sample while reasonably limiting foreground / background contamination .",
    "the color selection is roughly 7  times broader than the full - width of the red sequence we find below .",
    "the radial cutoff corresponds to about 1.0 mpc for both our adopted wmap cosmology and an einstein - desitter cosmology with @xmath26 .",
    "our final colors are measured within galaxy effective radii @xmath27 to avoid biasing the cm slope due to color gradients .",
    "we follow the basic approach outlined by van dokkum et  al.(1998 , 2000 ) .",
    "we derive the @xmath27 values using the program `` galfit '' ( peng et  al .",
    "2002 ) by fitting each galaxy to a sersic model ( convolved with the psf ) , but constraining the @xmath28 parameter such that @xmath29 .",
    "bright neighboring galaxies were fitted simultaneously .",
    "we note that subtraction of the model for the two central galaxies reveals evidence for interaction in the form of an -shaped residual .",
    "next , we deconvolve i_775@xmath14  and z_850@xmath15  postage stamp images of each galaxy using the clean algorithm ( hgborn 1974 ) in order to remove the differential blurring effects of the psf , which is @xmath410% broader in the z_850@xmath15  band . to reduce noise ,",
    "the clean maps are smoothed with a gaussian of @xmath30 pix before adding the residual images to the maps to ensure flux conservation .",
    "we then measure the i_775@xmath14  and z_850@xmath15  magnitudes of each galaxy within a circular aperture of radius @xmath27 , typically about 6 pix , or 03 .",
    "we did not allow the radius to drop below 3  pix .",
    "photometric errors were determined empirically from the pointing overlap regions .",
    "we reprocessed the 4 pointings separately and measured the color differences within @xmath27 for 202 pairs of measurements for 74 different early - type galaxies ( classifications described below ) in the overlap regions .",
    "we then median - filtered to obtain the errors as a smooth function of magnitude .",
    "the error thus determined for single - pointing ( i_775-z_850)@xmath1   measurements at @xmath31 was 0.025mag , rising to @xmath40.05mag at @xmath32 .",
    "each galaxy in our initial sample was examined and morphologically classified , following a procedure similar to that of fabricant et  al .",
    "this was done independently of the profile fitting , but the types show a good correlation with sersic @xmath28 index . here , we simply distinguish between e , s0 , and later types , where the intermediate s0 class indicates the apparent presence of a disk without spiral or other structure .",
    "full details on the classifications for a much larger sample , including the spatial distribution of the various types , will be presented by postman et  al .",
    "( 2003 , in preparation ) .",
    "about 180 galaxies in this field have measured redshifts , obtained with vlt / fors ( rosati et  al .",
    "2003 , in preparation ) , with 31 being cluster members .",
    "all galaxies in our initial sample classified as early - type , and not known to be interlopers from their spectra , are included in our cm analysis in the following section .",
    "of the 31 known members , 22 are classified as early - type , and we include all of these in our analysis even though one ( an s0 ) happened to lie beyond our 1  mpc cutoff .",
    "we fitted the early - type galaxy cm relations using simple linear least squares ; other methods gave very similar results .",
    "we estimate the scatter from both the standard rms and the biweight scale estimator ( beers et  al .",
    "no rejection was done in fitting subsamples composed of known members , the faintest of which has @xmath33 , or @xmath34 .",
    "we also performed fits to samples with unconfirmed members , allowing us to go 1mag further down the galaxy luminosity function .",
    "however , here we iterate to reject the 3-@xmath35 outliers , as these are likely to be interlopers : none of the 22 confirmed early - type members is more than 2.3-@xmath35 discordant .",
    "after the iterative rejection process , we find concordant scatters for those samples , and the rms and biweight estimator are the same to within @xmath360.001mag .",
    "figure  [ fig : finecmr ] presents the cm relation for the rdcs1252  galaxies .",
    "the fit to the full sample of early - type galaxies with @xmath37 gives @xmath38 other results are listed in table  [ tab : cmr ] .",
    "the mean locations of the cm relations for the elliptical and s0 subsamples agree to well within the errors , while the slopes are consistent at the 1.5-@xmath35 level .",
    "eight known late - type members from rosati et  al .",
    "( 2003 , in preparation ) for which we have photometry are bluer than the early - type galaxies by 0.25mag , with a scatter of 0.14 mag about this offset , indicating young stellar populations .",
    "we find an intrinsic scatter @xmath39 mag for the 15 confirmed elliptical members . for a limit of @xmath40 , we derive @xmath41 mag for the clipped sample of 31 ellipticals and @xmath42 for the 52 e+s0 galaxies . at this limit ,",
    "the observational errors become dominant and classification is difficult , which could bias our @xmath43 estimates . for @xmath44 , still 3mag down the luminosity function to about 0.3@xmath45 , we find @xmath46 for 25 ellipticals ( with no outliers ) .",
    "we estimate @xmath47 ab for rdcs1252 , based on local surveys ( norberg et  al .",
    "2002 ) , wmap cosmology , and @xmath481.4 mag luminosity evolution ( postman et  al .  2001",
    "; van dokkum & stanford 2003 ) .",
    "the correction from z_850@xmath15  to rest - frame @xmath49 is @xmath500.3 mag for an early - type spectrum .",
    "thus the brightest cluster member at @xmath51 corresponds to @xmath52 .",
    "the cluster red - sequence is about 0.1mag bluer than predicted for non - evolving elliptical templates ( coleman et  al .",
    "1980 ; schneider et  al .",
    "1983 ) . for comparison , a bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ;",
    "hereafter bc03 ) solar metallicity model reddens by 0.11 mag and fades by 1.5mag in aging from @xmath43 to @xmath411.5 gyr .",
    "the present - day relation for the coma cluster ( transformed according to the relations given below ) is also shown in figure  [ fig : finecmr ] .",
    "the tight cm relation allows us to constrain the scatter in early - type galaxy ages , subject to model uncertainties . the evolution in ( i_775-z_850)@xmath1  at this redshift is complicated at young ages because z_850@xmath15  straddles the 4000  break and has its blue end near the balmer jump at 3700 .",
    "the balmer jump reaches a maximum at 0.51 gyr , when the relative contribution from a stars is greatest , resulting in a red color at these ages .",
    "it is interesting that several of the s0s lie _ above _ the cm relation , possibly indicating ages @xmath53 gyr .",
    "as the a  star contribution lessens , the color quickly evolves towards the blue , reaching a local minimum near @xmath41.5 gyr , before commencing a roughly monotonic reddening with age .",
    "we have simulated the ( i_775-z_850)@xmath1  colors of galaxies formed under two simple star formation models , similar to those used by van dokkum et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) . in model  1 , the galaxies form in single bursts randomly distributed over the interval @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is set to the recombination epoch and @xmath56 gyr , the age of the universe at @xmath57 . in model  2 ,",
    "galaxies form stars at constant rates between randomly selected times @xmath58 , where @xmath59 .",
    "we vary @xmath60 and at each step calculate colors and luminosities for 10,000 `` galaxies '' by interpolation and integration of the bc03 solar metallicity models . assuming @xmath61 mag for the ellipticals , model  1 imples a minimum age @xmath62 gyr , i.e.",
    ", all galaxies finish forming at redshifts @xmath63 ; the mean luminosity - weighted age is @xmath64 gyr ( corresponding to @xmath65 ) with a scatter of 30% .",
    "model  2 gives @xmath66 gyr , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 gyr ( corresponding to @xmath69 ) with 38% scatter .",
    "thus , although some galaxies in model  2 have formed stars recently , the mean ages are still high .",
    "both models give a mean color @xmath70 , similar to that observed .",
    "for the s0s , we find @xmath71 for model 1 and @xmath72 , indicating recent star formation , and age scatters of 4447% .",
    "finally , we note that the 1996 version of the bc models would have predicted higher formation epochs , e.g. , @xmath73 and @xmath74 for the ellipticals in models 1 and 2 , respectively , and an age scatter of only 20% , although the predicted color is then redder by 0.1 mag .",
    "overall , we conclude that the ellipticals are an evolved population , with a mean age @xmath5 , a minimum age @xmath75 gyr , and an age scatter of ( @xmath76)% , where the error reflects uncertainty in @xmath43 and scatter in the models .",
    "to enable comparison with previous work , we convert observed ( i_775-z_850)@xmath1  quantities to rest - frame ( u - b)_z@xmath77  at @xmath78 .",
    "the models ( bc03 ; kodama et  al .",
    "1998 ) and empirical templates indicate @xmath79(i_775-z_850)@xmath1 , where the error bar reflects the scatter in the models at the relevant ages and adds about 20% uncertainty to our transformed slope and scatter .",
    "figure  [ fig : scatterz ] uses this conversion , and other transformations from van dokkum et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) , to compare our results to some previous studies of the cm relation in intermediate - redshift clusters with _",
    "hst _ , as well as the results of van dokkum et  al .",
    "2001 on rxj0848 + 4453 , the only cluster of comparable redshift to have its cm relation measured .",
    "linear fits to the data shown in figure  [ fig : scatterz ] yield slopes of @xmath80 and @xmath81 for the evolution in the absolute slope and the scatter , respectively .",
    "thus , the scatter is constant , and there is at best marginal evidence for slope evolution , which indicates that the slope is due to a variation in metallicity , not age .",
    "previous studies of cluster samples out to @xmath82 have come to similar conclusions ( e.g. , stanford et  al .",
    "1998 ; kodama et  al .",
    "1998 ; van dokkum et  al .",
    "van dokkum et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) concluded that the slope at @xmath83 was shallower than in the coma cluster .",
    "however , as shown in the figure , our slope measurement is consistent within the errors with both coma and rxj0848 + 4453 .",
    "further studies of a diversity of clusters at similar redshifts are needed to explore this issue .",
    "the lack of evolution in the cm relation scatter can be explained by progenitor bias ( e.g. , van dokkum & franx 2001 ) : galaxies selected as early - type at any epoch will have old stellar populations , while the later - type progenitors of the youngest ellipticals today will not be selected .",
    "the result is an underestimate in the color scatter for the progenitors of modern ellipticals , and thus overestimated ages .",
    "an upper limit on the scatter for elliptical progenitors may be estimated from a fit to all confirmed rdcs1252  members ; the result is 34 times larger than for the early - type galaxies . a detailed study of the morphological fractions in rdcs1252(postman et  al .  2003 , in preparation )",
    "should help illuminate the magnitude of this bias .",
    "we also note that the two central ellipticals themselves , based on their proximity and irregular isophotes , appear likely to undergo dissipationless merger to form a single @xmath84 galaxy , similar to local cd galaxies .",
    "we conclude that massive , evolved early - type galaxies were already present in rich clusters at @xmath57 .",
    "our simple models imply mean luminosity - weighted ages of 2.63.3 gyr , corresponding to formation at @xmath853.6 .",
    "however , the ( i_775-z_850)@xmath1  color is not ideal for the redshift of rdcs1252 , being better suited to measuring the 4000  break at @xmath86 . combining our acs data with deep , high - resolution near - ir imaging of this field ( lidman et  al .  2003 ) will enable a more robust assessment of early - type galaxy ages .",
    "in addition , further studies of the cm relations and morphologies of galaxies in other @xmath21 clusters are needed to improve the constraints on the formation epoch of cluster galaxies and on the evolution of their stellar populations and structural properties .",
