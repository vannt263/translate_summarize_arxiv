    "the electron - phonon ( @xmath0-@xmath1 ) interaction is at the heart of a number of important phenomena in solids .",
    "it can be a dominant factor in determining transport properties or produce broken symmetry states such as conventional superconductivity@xcite and/or charge - density - wave ( cdw ) order.@xcite in systems well described by fermi liquid theory , many of these phenomena are understood within the framework of migdal and eliashberg theory , which provides a quantitative account of this physics.@xcite the situation however can be quite different in correlated systems where the role of the @xmath0-@xmath1interaction is far less well understood , sometimes even on a qualitative level .    from an experimental point of view , interest in the @xmath0-@xmath1interaction in correlated systems has largely been driven by research on transition metal oxides , and in particular the high - t@xmath2 cuprates .",
    "for example , in undoped ca@xmath3na@xmath4cuocl@xmath5 , angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) studies have found broad gaussian spectral features which have been interpreted in terms of franck - condon processes and polaron physics.@xcite this is supported by models for a single hole coupled to the lattice and doped into an antiferromagnetic background,@xcite which reproduce the observed lineshape and dispersion .",
    "similarly , the structure of the optical conductivity of the undoped cuprates is well reproduced by models with strong ( polaronic ) @xmath0-@xmath1coupling.@xcite these observations point towards a strong @xmath0-@xmath1interaction in the undoped and underdoped cuprates , where strong correlations have the largest effect .",
    "evidence for lattice coupling also exists in the doped cuprates .",
    "perhaps the most discussed are the dispersion renormalizations in the nodal and anti - nodal regions of the brillouin zone revealed by arpes.@xcite these manifest as sharp changes or  kinks \" in the electronic band dispersion , which are generally believed to be due to coupling to a sharp bosonic mode .",
    "although the identity of this mode ( be it an electronic collective mode or one or more phonon modes ) remains controversial , the appearance of the dispersion renormalizations at multiple energy scales ranging from 10 - 110 mev strongly suggests coupling to a spectrum of oxygen phonons.@xcite these electronic renormalizations have analogous features in the density of states as probed by scanning tunnelling microscopy@xcite as well as in the optical properties of the cuprates.@xcite    moving beyond the cuprates , strong @xmath0-@xmath1and electron - electron ( @xmath0-@xmath0 ) interactions also are believed to be operative in a number of other systems .",
    "these include the quasi-1d edge - shared cuprates,@xcite the manganites , @xcite , the fullerenes,@xcite and the rare - earth nickelates.@xcite thus understanding the role of the @xmath0-@xmath1interaction in correlated systems is an important problem with possible implications across many materials families .",
    "one of the primary barriers to resolving these issues is the incomplete understanding of how the direct interplay between the @xmath0-@xmath1interaction and other important degrees of freedom ( such as strong @xmath0-@xmath0 interactions , magnetic degrees of freedom , reduced dimensionality , charge localization , _",
    "etc_. ) influences the @xmath0-@xmath1interaction . on quite general grounds",
    "one expects that competition and/or cooperative effects can significantly alter the nature of the @xmath0-@xmath0and @xmath0-@xmath1interactions .",
    "strong @xmath0-@xmath0interactions will suppress charge fluctuations and will have a tendency to localize carriers and renormalize the @xmath0-@xmath1interaction .",
    "conversely , the @xmath0-@xmath1interaction mediates a retarded attractive interaction between electrons that can counteract the repulsive coulomb interaction . however , the interaction with the lattice will further dress quasiparticle mass , producing heavier quasiparticles which may be affected more significantly by the @xmath0-@xmath0interaction . in the limit of strong coupling",
    "this can lead to small polaron formation which also localizes carriers . in the end which",
    ", if any , of these effects wins out is a complicated question .",
    "recent work has begun to examine these issues by incorporating the coulomb interaction at varying levels using a variety of analytical and numerical methods .",
    "this has resulted in a number of interesting results which are sometimes contradictory .",
    "recent fermi - liquid based treatments of the long - range components of the coulomb interaction have shown that the @xmath0-@xmath1 coupling constant can be significantly enhanced at small momentum transfers due to the quasi-2d nature of transport in the cuprates and the breakdown of screening in the deeply underdoped samples .",
    "@xcite the enhanced coupling in the forward scattering direction can enhance pairing in a @xmath6-wave superconductor@xcite and also affects the energy scale of the dispersion renormalization.@xcite the modification of the @xmath0-@xmath1vertex appears to be generic as studies examining the short - range components of the coulomb interaction as captured by the hubbard interaction find similar forward scattering enhancements of the @xmath0-@xmath1vertex.@xcite the short - range hubbard interaction may also impact the energy scale of the @xmath0-@xmath1renormalizations in the electronic dispersion as evidenced by a recent dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) study.@xcite    cooperative and competitive effects between the two interactions also have been examined in the limit of strong correlations .",
    "one example of this is in the context of understanding the anomalous broadening and softening of the cu - o bond stretching phonon modes in the high - t@xmath2 cuprates as a function of doping.@xcite attempts to account for the observed renormalizations within density functional theory have generally been unsuccessful , particularly in the case of the phonon linewidth.@xcite in contrast , correlated multiband and @xmath7-@xmath8 models with phonons have experienced more success in describing this physics.@xcite the most likely origin of this discrepancy is the underestimation of correlations and the over - prediction of screening effects within dft .",
    "the presence of multiple interactions is also expected to enhance quasiparticle masses and therefore influence the formation of small polarons .",
    "dmft studies of the hubbard - holstein ( hh ) model have found that the hubbard interaction modifies the critical coupling @xmath9 for the crossover to a small polaron.@xcite however , the suppression or enhancement of @xmath9 depends on the underlying phase : paramagnetic ( suppression ) or antiferromagnetic ( enhancement).@xcite these results indicate the importance of correlations and the presence of the underlying magnetic order . a diagrammatic monte carlo work on the @xmath7-@xmath8-holstein model also found an increased tendency towards polaron formation for a single hole doped into an afm background.@xcite similar results have been obtained in other approaches applied to @xmath0-@xmath1coupling in @xmath7-@xmath8 models,@xcite however these results are in contrast with the exact solution for a two - site hh model where @xmath9 increases for increasing hubbard interaction strengths.@xcite although this result was obtained for a small molecular cluster , it does highlight the need to examine models where @xmath10 is finite in order to allow for the possible destabilization of the afm correlations by the @xmath0-@xmath1interaction . without this effect",
    "it is impossible to address the competition between afm and a competing order driven by the @xmath0-@xmath1interaction , such as superconductivity or cdws , in an unbiased manner .    in the case of the hh model",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1and @xmath0-@xmath0interactions can drive competition between different ordered phases .",
    "take for example the half - filled hubbard and holstein models on a two dimensional square lattice .",
    "the single - band hubbard model has strong @xmath11 correlations which favor single occupation of the sites.@xcite conversely , the single - band holstein model exhibits a @xmath12 cdw phase transition at finite temperature.@xcite in the cdw ordered phase the lattice sites are doubly occupied in a checkerboard pattern .",
    "when both interactions are present the tendency towards these incompatible orders clearly will compete.@xcite competing orders in correlated systems is a prominent issue and a common theme in many transition metal oxides where novel physics often emerges at the boundary between orders .",
    "the @xmath13 phase diagrams of the half - filled hh model in one and infinite dimensions have been mapped out.@xcite recently this work was extended and a finite temperature phase diagram was proposed for the two - dimensional ( 2d ) case at half - filling using determinant quantum monte carlo ( dqmc).@xcite fig .",
    "[ fig : pd ] sketches the result , extending the diagram shown in fig . 4 of ref . to include additional metrics for the phases involved . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd]a the average value of the double occupancy is shown as a function of the @xmath0-@xmath0(@xmath10 ) and @xmath0-@xmath1(@xmath14 , dimensionless units , see below ) interaction strengths .",
    "when the @xmath0-@xmath0interaction dominates afm correlations develop and @xmath15 is small .",
    "conversely , when the @xmath0-@xmath1interaction dominates @xmath15 tends towards @xmath16 as half of the sites are doubly occupied in a @xmath11 checkerboard pattern .",
    "these limits are divided by the line where the strength of the @xmath0-@xmath0interactions is comparable to the @xmath0-@xmath1interaction ( indicated by the red line ) , which is taken to be the approximate phase boundary .",
    "this phase diagram is quite similar to the ones drawn for the one- and infinite- dimensional cases , however , in the vicinity of the transition there is debate as to whether there is an intervening metallic state . here , in the finite @xmath17 2d case , we find indications of such a phase.@xcite this is most clearly seen in the spectral weight at the fermi level , which is related to @xmath18@xcite and is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd]b . to the left ( right ) of transition region spectral weight",
    "is suppressed at the fermi level due to the opening of a mott ( cdw ) gap",
    ". however , in the transition region the spectral weight is maximal , consistent with an intervening metallic phase .",
    "the point of maximal spectral weight lays near the line where @xmath19 , a value equal to that expected for a paramagnetic metal .",
    "furthermore , as the temperature is lowered , the low energy spectral weight in the intervening phase grows , indicative of metallic behavior , while the spectral weight in the large @xmath10 and @xmath14 regimes falls , as expected for an insulator @xcite .",
