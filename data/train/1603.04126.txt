    "in general , the study of vacuum neutrino oscillations is made in the framework of usual quantum mechanics , which considers the system of neutrinos as isolated . in this work",
    "we will do a different kind of analysis , in the framework of quantum open systems , considering that the neutrinos , which will be our subsystem of interest , have a coupling with the enviroment .",
    "the theory of quantum open systems was one of the theories created to deal with the case in which the system of interest is not considered isolated @xcite . in this theory , the system of interest is regarded as having a coupling with the enviroment , and such coupling has important consequences , since we are dealing with quantum systems .",
    "as we will see , the coupling with the enviroment will act changing the superposition of states , eliminating the coherence , similarly to what we have when a measurement is made in a quantum system .",
    "we see then , that this coupling generates a decoherence efffect .",
    "we can find in the literature studies of the decoherence effect applied to neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "using this different approach to study neutrino oscillations we see that different forms of the survival probability are obtained @xcite , and the goal of this work is to test one form of the equations for the survival probability with decoherence using data from the kamland experiment .",
    "kamland @xcite is a long baseline experiment , located at the kamioka mine , gifu , japan , made to detect electron antineutrinos which come from nuclear reactors being at an average distance of @xmath9 km from the detector .",
    "it was constructed to test the so called large mixing angle ( lma ) solution for the solar neutrino problem @xcite , and its results were found to have a striking agreement with solar neutrino results @xcite .",
    "the goal of this work is to obtain new limits for the parameter @xmath1 which describes decoherence , considering the most recent kamland data .",
    "we will also stress its relevance and the difference between the results found in this work from others such as the one from @xcite .",
    "but first we review the theory of quantum open systems , and then we see how it can be used to study neutrino oscillations . in the case",
    "considered , we will see how the decoherence effect arises , generating a different form of the survival probability , which is tested using a @xmath0 test .",
    "we show then the results of the simulations and the limits of the parameters . in 95 % c.l .",
    "the limits found are @xmath3 for @xmath4 , @xmath5 for @xmath6 , and @xmath7 for @xmath8 , assuming an energy dependence of the type @xmath2 .",
    "in this section we will introduce the formalism used to obtain probabilities with dissipation effects from the lindblad master equation . in this formalism",
    "the neutrinos are treated as an open quantum system and it interacts with the quantum environment .",
    "we assume that the quantum environment works as a reservoir .",
    "these two quantum states compose the global system , and from the interaction between neutrinos and environment arise the dissipation effects @xcite . in quantum open system theory it is possible to show that if the interaction between the subsystem of interest , which are the neutrinos in this case , and the reservoir is weak , the dynamic can be made by the lindblad master equation @xcite .",
    "a review of the fundamentals of quantum open system theory can be found in the following refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the lindblad master equation can be written as @xcite : @xmath10 + d[\\rho(t ) ] \\label{i}\\ ] ] with , @xmath11 =   \\frac{1}{2 } \\displaystyle \\sum_{k=1}^{n^2 - 1 } \\left ( [ v_k , \\rho(t ) v_k^\\dag ] + [ v_k \\rho(t ) , v_k^\\dag ] \\right ) \\",
    ", , \\label{ii}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the dimension of the hilbert space of the subsystem of interest . in this equation",
    "we see a term which is equal to the one we have in the liouville equation , but we also have the term @xmath13 $ ] which appears because we are dealing with an open system , different from what we have in usual quantum mechanics , where the system is considered isolated",
    ". we will impose on this equation that the entropy increases with time , in order that @xmath13 $ ] evolves a pure state to a state of maximal mixing asymptotically . using the von neumann",
    "entropy it is possible to show that this condition leads to restrictions on the operator @xmath14 , in particular we see that it must be hermitian @xcite .    the lindblad equation in ( [ i ] ) can be expanded in the basis of @xmath15 matrices , since the three neutrino families are considered in this work . in this form ,",
    "each operator in eq .",
    "( [ i ] ) can be expanded as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 are the gell - mann matrices .",
    "then , the evolution equation in eq .",
    "( [ i ] ) can be written as @xmath18 with @xmath19 to keep the probability conservation .",
    "it is important to note that the @xmath20 and its solution is given by @xmath21 , where n is the number of families . for simplicity",
    ", we do not include this component in the equation above .",
    "there are many parameters in the dissipator matrix @xmath22 .",
    "however , it is possible to reduce the number of these parameters considerably if we impose some physical and mathematical constraints .    in order to obtain a dissipator matrix @xmath22 with parameters that describe well known effects",
    ", we can impose first that @xmath23=0 $ ] . from the physical point of view",
    ", this commutation relation implies energy conservation in the neutrino subsystem and also this constraint includes the decoherence effect in the evolution .",
    "this effect eliminates the quantum coherence , and the oscillation probability is changed by damping terms that are multiplied by oscillation terms . in this condition , the @xmath22 assumes the following form @xmath24 where each @xmath25 can describe the decoherence effect between the families @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the energy conservation constraint on the neutrino subsystem is very rigorous because once the neutrinos are free to interact with the reservoir the energy can fluctuate , and hence this constraint may not be satisfied .",
    "so , we can contemplate the situation where @xmath23\\neq0 $ ] adding other two new parameters in @xmath28 and @xmath29 such that the dissipator in eq .",
    "( [ iv ] ) becomes @xmath30 where again @xmath25 can describe the decoherence effect between the families @xmath26 and @xmath27 , while @xmath31 and @xmath32 describe the so called relaxation effect .",
    "the relaxation effect is a phenomenon that dynamically leads the states to their maximal mixing state .",
    "this phenomenon appears in the oscillation probabilities through the damping term multiplied by terms that depend only on mixing parameters .",
    "then , when the relaxation effect is taken into account the probabilities tend asymptotically to @xmath33 , where @xmath12 is the number of families initially considered .    in general , if a particular density matrix represents an initial physical state , the density matrix evolved by eq .",
    "( [ i ] ) may be not a well - defined quantum state .",
    "complete positivity is a constraint on @xmath34 which always keeps the evolution made by eq .",
    "( [ i ] ) as being physical @xcite . from complete positivity",
    "the @xmath22 needs to be a positive matrix and this is satisfied if the diagonal elements of @xmath34 are larger than off - diagonal elements .",
    "so , we are going to consider the dissipator matrix obtained in eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) to evolve the neutrinos according to the complete positivity , which corresponds to the most effective dissipator that we can obtain .",
    "any other off - diagonal element can be represented in function of the main diagonal elements , since the @xmath31 and @xmath32 parameters are non - null .",
    "it is possible to prove that the hamiltonian in the effective mass basis is written as @xmath35 with @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) is useful in the case where the appearance of @xmath40 and @xmath41 is experimentally indistinguishable .",
    "the relation between the flavor state and the effective mass basis is given by the following transformation @xmath42 where the @xmath43 is the flavor state and @xmath44 is the effective mass state .",
    "the mixing matrix @xmath45 is explicitly defined as @xmath46 and the effective mixing angle has the usual form @xmath47 with the difference that the @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 .",
    "we have defined a diagonal form to the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) . hence , the dissipators in eq .",
    "( [ iv ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) remain diagonal as well .",
    "the evolved density matrix in the effective mass basis is given by : @xmath50 where @xmath51 are elements of the initial state obtained from eq .",
    "( [ ix ] ) and @xmath52 . while the @xmath53 elements are given by @xmath54 these damping terms in the diagonal elements",
    "describe the relaxation effect through the parameters @xmath55 and @xmath32 .",
    "besides that , they depend on the mixing parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 and the distance between the source and the detection point . the main diagonal in state ( [ xi ] )",
    "can be interpreted as the probabilities to find @xmath58 , @xmath59 or @xmath60 of the observable @xmath61 in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) . in usual",
    "quantum mechanics , these elements do not change with the propagation .",
    "so , analysing the state in ( [ xi ] ) we can see how the relaxation effect act on the probabilities .",
    "the state in ( [ xi ] ) shows how the relaxation effect depends on the propagation distance .",
    "considering msw , the solution for solar neutrinos , we expect that the relaxation effects are strongly constrained by neutrinos of this source .",
    "we will present this analysis somewhere else , but the sun - eath distance is of the order of @xmath62 ev@xmath63 and a rough limit for both relaxation parameters is @xmath64 ev , if the relaxation effects have these magnitudes , the damping terms stay around @xmath65\\sim 1 $ ] .",
    "thus , the analysis of reactor neutrinos can disregard the relaxation effect because the larger baseline to this source is much smaller than sun - earth distance .",
    "the off - diagonal elements are known as coherence elements . in state ( [ xi ] ) , due to the damping terms these elements tend to zero during the propagation .",
    "this is the exact definition of the decoherence effect .",
    "but , in the solar neutrino context , these elements are avereged out and then any decoherence effect information is lost if we consider a model - independent approach @xcite .",
    "this is also happens here in the cases of the coherence elements @xmath66 , that dependent on @xmath67 with @xmath68 which oscillate very fast , and hence are avereged out .",
    "it happens in the case of kamland , because @xmath69 .",
    "so , disregarding the fast - oscillating terms and the relaxation effects , the state is given by : @xmath70 and using the eq .",
    "( [ ix ] ) to write the state above in the flavor basis , the survival probability can be obtained by taking @xmath71   \\label{xiv}\\ ] ] where the initial state for @xmath72 is @xmath73 .",
    "so , the survival probability is given by @xcite : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is written @xmath76 \\label{xvii}\\ ] ] that is the same probability obtained in two - neutrino approximation when the decoherence effect is taken into account @xcite .",
    "it is important to explain the difference between the analysis made in this work and the one made in @xcite , where they use a different set of data from kamland ( older than the one considered here ) , but also consider data from solar neutrinos .",
    "the first difference is that we are dealing with three neutrino families .",
    "moreover , as shown in @xcite and we mentioned before , there are cases in which , besides the decoherence effect , other effects arise from the coupling with the enviroment , such as the so called relaxation effect @xcite . since in our case ,",
    "as previously shown , decoherence is the only relevant effect in the interaction with the enviroment , including solar neutrinos in the analysis would not bring any new information regarding the decoherence parameter , since solar neutrinos can not be used to bound decoherence , because the fast oscillating terms in @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 average out all the coherence terms , as said in @xcite and shown in @xcite and mentioned before .",
    "therefore , the effect studied here is different from the one studied by lisi et al in @xcite . according to @xcite , lisi et al found limits for the parameter referent to the relaxation effect in @xcite , and for the decoherence parameter through a model - dependent approach .",
    "we use a model - independent approach in this paper to analyze the kamland data .",
    "in ref . @xcite from march 2011 , we have a set of data , in which the number of energy bins is 20 . for this set of data",
    ", we made a test using the usual oscillation probability which are : @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "we can see that @xmath83 is close to the number of degrees of freedom , indicating a good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "considering now the oscillation probability in eq .",
    "( [ xvii ] ) with the three family approximation ( eq .",
    "21 ) , and the three free parameters @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath1 , and also considering an energetic dependence on @xmath1 :    @xmath86    with @xmath87 , such as the onde done by @xcite .",
    "we did this test for @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "we also considered the best - fit value for @xmath57 given by pdg @xcite , @xmath91 .",
    "the best - fit results for this case can be seen in table i , for the three values of @xmath92 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to visualize the effect of the inclusion of decoherence in our study of neutrino oscillations , we can reproduce an important graph originally presented by the kamland collaboration .    following the same procedure used by kamland we used our results to make fig .",
    "10 , which is the result of merging the original graph @xcite and the graph we made for oscillation with decoherence .     in the energy dependence .",
    "we also include the kamland data @xcite ]    in fig .",
    "10 we can see that the fit of the data made from our model of oscillation with decoherence is a good fit of the data , showing a visual confirmation of the analysis provided by the @xmath0 test .",
    "we see that the inclusion of decoherence causes a damping on the oscillation pattern , as we already expected from our theoretical predictions .",
    "we can also see that this damping is not too strong , because if we compare the size of the error bars of the original graph with the oscillation with decoherence curves for the different values of @xmath92 in the energy dependence , we can see that it is still a possible curve to fit the data from kamland .",
    "in this work , we treated the appearence of the decoherence effect on neutrino oscillations in a phenomenological approach , studying first quantum open systems in general , and then aplying the results to the case of neutrino oscillation in three families , since it is one of the models used in the analysis of kamland data .",
    "the results were obtained when we considered the most recent set of data , provided by ref .",
    "@xcite , where the number of events were presented for 20 bins . comparing the value of @xmath93 with the number of degrees of freedom",
    ", we saw that including the third parameter , @xmath1 , improved considerably the fit of the data .",
    "with @xmath94 we obtained @xmath95 , and for @xmath1 as a free parameter ( hence 20 experimental points and 3 parameters ) we obtained a decrease of at least 3 unit for @xmath93 .",
    "these results are sumarized in table i. we also found a best - fit value with @xmath96 .",
    "to support the results of our analysis , giving a more visual way of evaluating the results , we reproduced an important graph originally presented by the kamland collaboration , which showed the survival probability _ versus _ @xmath97 , and is a graph that shows clearly the oscillation pattern for the neutrinos .    comparing the original graph with our reproduction of the graph , which mas made using the best - fit values obtained in our simulation",
    ", we saw that our model provided a fit of the data which was indeed in agreement with the experiment uncertainties , as can be seen in fig .",
    "so we have another evidence that our model provides a good fit for the experimental data .",
    "we also determined new limits for @xmath98 , in 95% c.l .. the limits are presented in table ii , and were determined based on the confidence level curves made from this most recent set of data @xcite , and are in figs . 1 to 9 ."
