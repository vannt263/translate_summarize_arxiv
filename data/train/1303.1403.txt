    "half a century after its invention by kane yee @xcite the finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) method remains a popular choice for simulating the propagation of electromagnetic waves and their interaction with electronic media @xcite .",
    "the simplicity of the algorithm and its low computational footprint are contrasted by the use of non - conformal grids , which , if field discontinuities are not properly accounted for , reduce accuracy from second to first order @xcite .",
    "this not only negates the advantage of the staggered grid yee - algorithm but also impacts on the computational cost when modeling systems that exhibit geometric features on sub - wavelength scales due to poor convergence .",
    "the problem of restoring accuracy of the fdtd scheme in the presence of interfaces was first studied in the microwave regime @xcite . since",
    "then a variety of effective - permittivity ( ep ) models have been suggested for the treatment of field discontinuities at material interfaces , which can broadly be classified as either contour - path ( cp ) or volume - polarized ( vp ) models @xcite .",
    "fundamentally , defining the effective permittivity @xmath0 as volume - average ( va ) of the permittivity @xmath1 over one yee - cell @xmath2 is compatible with the standard fdtd scheme but does not constitute an accurate vp model as discontinuities of the electric field at interfaces are not accounted for . in this context",
    "the vp model proposed by farjadpour et al .",
    "@xcite is of particular importance .",
    "based on the continuity of the parallel electric and normal displacement field components , the effective permittivity tensor is derived as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 performs a vector - projection onto the face - normal of the interface .",
    "the application of this non - diagonal and anisotropic permittivity tensor requires interpolation of the yee - centered @xmath5-field to the cell - center and subsequent interpolation of the cell - centered @xmath6-field back onto the yee - grid , a procedure that effectively equates to a smoothing operation with extended spatial stencil @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , as numerical evidence suggests , the spectral accuracy increases to approximately second order , reducing the computational cost for problems that involve non - dispersive dielectrics ( e.g. , photonic crystal applications ) . in 2007 , deinega et al .",
    "@xcite suggested an approach that extends this method to the linear dispersive regime .",
    "their algorithm uses the decomposition @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 , to split the electric field into four independent components , which drive the polarization currents at the interface . while the split - field approach applies to the general case it is noteworthy that splitting the electric field into normal and parallel components is not always necessary .",
    "for example , lee et al . @xcite",
    "derive a model that uses an effective conductivity tensor in the quasi - static limit without splitting the fields , while liu et al .",
    "@xcite employ a rotation of the coordinate system in conjunction with modified material responses to avoid an explicit computation of the four split - field components .",
    "the resulting algorithms are computationally more efficient yet less general in the sense that they do not apply to arbitrary dispersive material responses .",
    "furthermore , as in @xcite , it remains unspecified how these algorithms interface with the standard yee - centered algorithm that could be efficiently employed across regions where permittivities are smooth .",

    "@xmath11 fields ( black ) are calculated using the standard va fdtd algorithm , introducing systematic errors at interface - cells due to discontinuities of the field .",
    "the surface currents @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( red ) correct the errors during the electric ( left ) and magnetic ( right ) update steps . calculating the corrective currents requires an intermediate step for integrating the surface charge density @xmath14 at the cell center ( middle ) .",
    "note , that @xmath10 is an approximate field from which we can reconstruct the discretized electric field @xmath6 .",
    "the algorithm is valid for any number of dimensions ( one to three ) and compatible with the standard yee scheme as the dispersive corrections only apply to interface cells . ]    at ( current page.south ) ;    here , we present an alternative vp approach ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) that solves the ep curl equations on the yee - grid using the standard volume - averaged fdtd algorithm but replaces the electric field with an approximate field @xmath10 that is continuous across non - dispersive interfaces .",
    "the field discontinuities at dispersive media interfaces need then to be captured as corrective electric and magnetic currents @xmath12 and @xmath13 , which are induced by a surface charge field @xmath14 . based on this idea",
    "we first formulate an effective medium theory and then show how this ep model translates into a fdtd scheme that offers some unique advantages : 1 ) the algorithm naturally extends the standard fdtd scheme by introducing additive current corrections that only apply at interface cells ; 2 ) only the normal field components are subjected to spatial smoothing operations at the interface ; and 3 ) calculating the corrections is computationally efficient and requires no alteration of the dispersive response functionals ( as for example in @xcite ) . in the result section , we apply the derived algorithm to the example of a highly dispersive mie scatterer in two dimensions , demonstrating stability and allowing for a comparison of numerical errors between the va+cc ( using current corrections ) , the va , and standard staircasing schemes .",
    "our starting point are the split - field equations derived by deinega et al .",
    "@xcite ( equations ( 3)-(6 ) therein ) . without loss of generality",

    "we do not impose restrictions on the numbers of dimensions ( i.e. , the equations are valid for the two- and three - dimensional case ) .",

    "angled brackets are used throughout this work to denote volume averages of the form @xmath30 .",
    "the derivation of ( [ eq : deinega ] ) is straightforward but their translation into an efficient and stable finite - difference scheme is not . to retain second order accuracy ,",
    "the field components in the curl expression @xmath31 should be calculated on the yee - grid while the projections onto parallel and normal projections require interpolation to the cell - center . after calculating the updates of the @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 components at the cell - center",
    "the @xmath6-field thus needs to be reconstructed and redistributed onto the yee - grid .",
    "however , a direct implementation proves impractical for the following reason .",
    "the cell - centered four - field representation and the extended spatial stencil ( due to interpolation between the grids ) is incompatible with the standard yee - algorithm . as a consequence",
    "the algorithm is best deployed across the whole grid irrespective of whether cells are intersected by media - boundaries or not .",
    "this introduces unnecessary smoothing operations across the whole grid , increases the computational cost and requires a reimplementation of the infrastructure typically associated with fdtd frameworks ( e.g. , total - field scattered - field injection , boundary conditions etc ) .",
    "we here seek to derive an alternative formulation where the standard yee scheme can be efficiently applied across the domain augmented by corrections that only apply to the comparably small number of interface cells .",
    "the basis for this corrective method is a reformulation of ( [ eq : deinega ] ) . in introducing new variables for the normal electric field and",

    "the corrections apply at interface cells only and vanish whenever permittivities vary smoothly across cells . the magnetic current correction @xmath13 accounts for field discontinuities caused by a jump in the static permittivity across the interface , while the electric current correction @xmath12 captures all discontinuities induced by the dispersive material response .",

  "abstract_text": [
    "<S> we present a corrective subcell averaging technique that improves on the accuracy of the volume - averaged finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) method in the presence of dispersive material interfaces__. _ _ the method is based on an alternative effective - medium formulation that captures field discontinuities at interfaces as electric and magnetic surface currents . in calculating the spectra of strongly dispersive mie scatterers we demonstrate that the derived fdtd algorithm is both highly efficient and able to approximately restore second order accuracy . </S>"
