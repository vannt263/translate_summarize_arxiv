    "the deuteron is particularly well suited because of its small binding energy and its simple structure .",

    "<S> the photoproduction of @xmath0 on the deuteron has been investigated with the inclusion of @xmath1 and @xmath2 final - state interaction ( fsi ) , as well as the pion- mediated process @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 rescattering effects for the inclusive cross section are found to be large in the threshold regions . </S>",
    "<S> polarization observables show sizable fsi effects at larger kaon and hyperon angles . it is shown that the extraction of the elementary @xmath4 amplitude is possible in the quasi - free scattering region where fsi effects are negligible . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the cross sections in this region are large , indicating that measurements in this kinematical region are favored . </S>"
