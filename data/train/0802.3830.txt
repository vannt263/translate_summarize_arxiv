    "in this paper we discuss a testable and well - constrained model for dark matter  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we explain how microwave emissions are an inevitable consequence of our proposal , and test the model against a recent analysis of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) observations that suggest an anomalous emission from the core of our galaxy ( dubbed the `` wmaphaze '' )  @xcite . despite having no free parameters",
    " the model is completely fixed by observations at scales some 10 orders higher  our proposal is consistent with these observations , and could even explain the anomaly if it survives further scrutiny .",
    "this provides a highly nontrivial test of our proposal , which remains consistent with all known constraints .    to calculate the emissions",
    ", however , requires a careful analysis of several fields of physics , and it is easy to lose track of the overall structure of the calculation .",
    "we organize the paper as follows : in section  [ sec : proposal ] , we present a short review of the dark - matter proposal , emphasizing the assumptions that underlie the model , the observational constraints that the model must satisfy , and outlining the mechanism by which the dark matter will radiate , thus rendering it observable . in section  [ sec : therm - prop - nugg ] , we summarize the calculation of the thermal microwave emission from the dark matter , and show in section  [ sec : comp - wmap - haze ] how this is consistent with the observations . finally , in section",
    "[ sec : summary ] , we review all of the observational constraints of our proposal and discuss the testable predictions that it makes . to keep the logic clear , some technical details",
    "have been omitted from core of the paper .",
    "we include these in the appendix , completing our calculation .",
    "two of the outstanding cosmological mysteries  the natures of dark matter and baryogenesis  might be explained by the idea that dark matter consists of compact composite objects ( ccos )  @xcite similar to witten s strangelets  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that these ccos  nuggets of dense matter and antimatter  form at the same qcd phase transition as conventional baryons ( neutrons and protons ) , providing a natural explanation for the similar scales @xmath0 .",
    "baryogenesis proceeds through a charge separation mechanism : both matter and antimatter nuggets form , but the natural cp violation of the so - called @xmath1 term in qcd is nonzero , one must confront the so - called strong cp problem whereby some mechanism must be found to make the effective @xmath1 parameter extremely small today in accordance with measurements .",
    "this problem remains one of the most outstanding puzzles of the standard model , and one of the most natural resolutions is to introduce an axion field .",
    "( see the original papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and recent reviews @xcite . )",
    "axion domain walls associated with this field ( or ultimately , whatever mechanism resolves the strong cp problem ) play an important role in forming these nuggets , and may play in important role in their ultimate stability . see  @xcite for details.]which was of order unity @xmath2 during the qcd  phase transition  drives the formation of more antimatter nuggets than matter nuggets , resulting in the leftover baryonic matter that forms visible matter today ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "note , it is crucial for our mechanism that cp violation can drive charge separation .",
    "this idea may already have found experimental support through the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven @xcite .    this mechanism requires no fundamental baryon asymmetry to explain the observed matter / antimatter asymmetry . from this , and the observed relation @xmath3 ( see  @xcite for a review ) we have    [ eq:321 ] @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the total number of baryons _ minus _ the number of antibaryons in the universe , @xmath6 is the total number of baryons _ plus _ the total number of antibaryons hidden in the nuggets and antinuggets that make up the dark matter , @xmath7 is the total number of baryons contained in all of the dark - matter nuggets , @xmath8 is the total number of antibaryons contained in all of the dark - antimatter nuggets , and @xmath9 is the total number of residual `` visible '' baryons ( regular matter ) .",
    "solving equations  ( [ eq:321 ] ) gives the approximate ratios @xmath8:@xmath7:@xmath10 3:2:1 .",
    "unlike conventional dark matter candidates , dark - matter / antimatter nuggets will be strongly interacting , but macroscopically large objects .",
    "they do not contradict any of the many known observational constraints on dark matter or antimatter  @xcite for three reasons :    they carry a huge ( anti)baryon charge @xmath11 ",
    "@xmath12 , so they have an extremely tiny number density .",
    "this explains why they have not been directly observed on earth .",
    "the local number density of dark - matter particles with these masses is small enough that interactions with detectors are exceedingly rare and fall within all known detector and seismic constraints  @xcite .",
    "( see also @xcite and references therein .",
    "10 kg to 1 ton ( corresponding to @xmath13 ) must account for less than an order of magnitude of the local dark matter .",
    "while our preferable range of @xmath14 is somewhat smaller @xcite and does not contradict @xcite , we still believe that @xmath15 is not completely excluded by apollo data , as the corresponding constraint is based on specific model dependent assumptions about the nugget mass - distribution @xcite , whereas nugget formation due to charge separation as suggested in @xcite may lead to a very different distribution . ] )    the nuggets have nuclear densities , so their interaction cross - section is small @xmath16-@xmath17  @xmath18/g .",
    "this is well below typical astrophysical and cosmological limits which are on the order of @xmath19  @xmath18/g .",
    "dark - matter  dark - matter interactions between these nuggets are thus negligible .",
    "they have a large binding energy such that baryons in the nuggets are not available to participate in big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) at @xmath20 .",
    "in particular , we suspect that the baryons in these nuggets form a superfluid with a gap of the order @xmath21 , and critical temperature @xmath22 mev , as this scale provides a natural explanation for the observed photon to baryon ratio @xmath23  @xcite , which requires a formation temperature of @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "thus , on large scales , the nuggets are sufficiently dilute that they behave as standard collisionless cold dark matter ( ccdm ) .",
    "when the number densities of both dark and visible matter become sufficiently high , however , dark - antimatter  visible - matter collisions may release significant radiation and energy .",
    "in particular , antimatter nuggets provide a site at which interstellar baryonic matter  mostly protons and electrons  can annihilate , producing emissions with calculable spectra and energies that should be observable from the core of our galaxy .",
    "these emissions are not only consistent with current observations , but seem to naturally explain several mysterious diffuse emissions observed from the core of our galaxy , with frequencies ranging over some 12 orders of magnitude .",
    "although somewhat unconventional , this idea naturally explains several coincidences , is consistent with all known cosmological constraints , and makes definite , testable predictions .",
    "furthermore , this idea is almost entirely rooted in conventional and well - established physics . in particular , there are no `` free parameters '' that can be  or need to be``tuned '' to explain observations : in principle , everything is calculable from well - established properties of qcd  and qed . in practice , fully calculating the properties of these nuggets requires solving the fermion many - body problem at strong coupling , so we must resort to `` fitting '' a handful of phenomenological parameters from observations .",
    "nevertheless , these unknown parameters may be determined to within an order of magnitude by observations of processes at the kev scale ( described below and in @xcite ) .",
    "the model then makes unambiguous predictions about other processes ranging over more than 10 orders of magnitude in scale .",
    "the point of this paper is to show that , remarkably , these unambiguous predictions are completely consistent with current observations , providing compelling evidence for our proposal , and explaining another astrophysical puzzle : the origin of the so - called `` wmaphaze ''  @xcite .",
    "gev , and therefore , annihilation must produce significant amounts of high energy radiation  @xcite if it is to also explain microwave emissions with a typical frequency of @xmath25 .",
    "for example , if one takes central values for the wimp parameters , then the microwave intensity from wimp annihilation would be well below the observed intensity  @xcite . in any case",
    ", this proposal has very different predictions than ours .",
    "] we have considered five independent observations of diffuse radiation from the core of our galaxy :    spi / integral  observes 511  photons from positronium decay that is difficult to explain with conventional astrophysical positron sources  @xcite .",
    "dark - antimatter nuggets would provide an unlimited source of positrons as suggested in  @xcite .",
    "comptel  detects a puzzling excess of 120 mev @xmath26-ray radiation .",
    "we shall not discuss this here , but it has been shown in @xcite that the direct e@xmath27e@xmath28 annihilation spectrum could nicely explain this deficit .",

    "visible - matter / dark - antimatter annihilation would provide this energy .",
    "egret / crgo  detects mev to gev gamma - rays , constraining antimatter annihilation rates .",
    "we shall not discuss these constraints here , but it was shown in  @xcite that these constraints are consistent with the rates inferred from the other emissions .",
    "wmap has detected an excess of ghz microwave radiation  dubbed the `` wmap  haze''from the inner @xmath29 core of our galaxy  @xcite .",
    "annihilation energy not immediately released by the above mechanisms will thermalize , and subsequently be released as thermal bremsstrahlung emission at the ev scale .",
    "although the ev scale emission will be obscured by other astrophysical sources , the tail of the emission spectrum is very hard , and carries enough energy in the microwave to explain the wmap  haze .",
    "to proceed , we start with the three basic postulates assumed in  @xcite :    the antimatter nuggets provide a virtually unlimited source of positrons ( e@xmath27 ) such that impinging electrons ( e@xmath28 ) will readily annihilate at their surface through the formation of positronium  @xcite .    about a quarter of the positronium annihilations release back - to - back 511 kev photons . on average one of these photons",
    "will be absorbed by the nugget while the other will be released .",
    "the nuggets provide a significant source of antibaryonic matter such that impinging protons will annihilate .",
    "we assume that the proton annihilation rate is directly related to that of electrons through a suppression factor @xmath30 as discussed in @xcite .",
    "proton annihilation events will release about @xmath31of energy per event and will occur close to the surface of the nugget creating a hot spot that will radiate x - ray photons with kev energies containing some fraction @xmath32 of the total annihilation energy .",
    "the remaining fraction @xmath33 will be released at the ev scale , after the energy has thermalized within the nuggets .",
    "the tail of this thermal emission will be released in the microwave spectrum and may explain the observed wmap  haze .",
    "to further test this theory and connect all of these emissions , we make an additional assumption :    we assume that the emitted 511 kev photons dominate the observed 511 kev flux , that the emitted kev x - rays dominate the observed diffuse x - ray flux , and that the thermally emitted microwaves dominate the observed wmap  haze .",
    "the basis for this assumption is that none of these fluxes has a convincing explanation .",
    "the nuggets may thus provide the missing explanation in each case .",
    "this assumption allows us to use the observations at the kev scale  the 511  emission measured by integral , and the diffuse x - ray emission measured by _",
    "chandra_to fix all of the phenomenological parameters @xcite .",
    "the model then makes unambiguous predictions about the properties of the wmap  haze , allowing it to be tested .",
    "as we shall see , the agreement is remarkable : even though our estimates are only accurate up to the order of magnitude , the picture that dark matter consists mostly of antimatter nuggets can completely explain all three of these puzzling emissions without contradicting a single observation .      as discussed in  @xcite ,",
    "our proposal is that both electrons and protons annihilate on antimatter nuggets , releasing observable radiation from `` hot spots '' near the annihilation sites .",
    "these emissions are best though of as `` jets '' , and occur sufficiently rapidly that they are produced on a per - event basis , thus producing a spectrum that is independent of the local environment  @xcite .",
    "this includes the @xmath34 spectrum from positronium annihilation  @xcite , the spectrum up to @xmath35 from direct e@xmath27e@xmath28 annihilation  @xcite , the diffuse @xmath36 radiation from p@xmath27p@xmath28 annihilation  @xcite , and the occasional gev photon produced directly from proton annihilation  @xcite .",
    "the rates of annihilation and the energies released have been correlated  @xcite with the observed diffuse @xmath34 positronium emission  @xcite and diffuse @xmath36 emissions  @xcite observed from the core of the galaxy , providing a test of the model .",
    "it was shown that both of these emissions could be nicely accounted for if the rate of x - ray energy released from p@xmath27p@xmath28 annihilation was related to that of e@xmath28e@xmath27 annihilation through a suppression factor @xmath37 where the factor @xmath38 accounts for proton reflection from the sharp nuclear matter interface , and the factor @xmath39 accounts for the fraction of the @xmath40 p@xmath27p@xmath28 annihilation energy released at the `` hot - spots '' .",
    "the topic of this paper is the remaining fraction @xmath33 of the @xmath40 annihilation energy that will be transmitted deep withing the nuggets , ultimately being thermally radiated at a much lower energy scale .",
    "we shall show that most of this energy will be released at the ev scale , making it difficult to observe against the bright stellar background .",
    "the spectrum of this emission , however , will be shown to be extremely hard , resulting in a significant release of detectable microwave energy ( @xmath41 ev ) .",
    "our main point is that this microwave emission could fully account for the recently observed wmap  haze  @xcite : a puzzling diffuse emission from the core of our galaxy .    in section  [ sec :",
    "therm - emiss - from ] we estimate the thermal emissivity of nuggets , and the spectrum of the emitted radiation . in section  [ sec : therm - nugg ] we show how the nuggets reach thermodynamic equilibrium at an ev scale by balancing the annihilation rate with the emission .",
    "armed with these estimates , in section  [ sec : comp - wmap - haze ] we compare the predictions of our model with the observations of the wmap  haze , using our previous results  @xcite to provide the normalizations , and arrive at the remarkable conclusion that our proposal naturally explains the energy budget  [ sec : energy - budget ] and spectrum  [ sec : spectrum ] of the observations , even though the predictions are at an energy scale some 10 orders of magnitude smaller than the 511 kev scale at which the normalization was fixed ! finally , in section  [ sec : conclusion ] we reiterate the testable predictions our model makes , thus providing a method with which to confirm or rule out the proposal over the next few years .",
    "here we discuss the properties of thermal emission from the `` electrosphere '' of the nuggets at low temperatures @xmath42 ev . as we shall show in section  [ sec : therm - nugg ]",
    ", this temperature can be established by comparing the rate of annihilation energy deposited in the nugget with the rate of emission . in what follows",
    ", we shall present a simple estimate to capture the order of magnitude of the process . in principle , the exact numerical factors can be computed , but such a calculation is extremely tedious , and would be of no use since there are other uncertainties in this problem of a similar magnitude .",
    "the emissivity depends on the density @xmath43 of the positron cloud , which varies as a function of the distance @xmath44 from the quark matter core . at the ev scale temperatures ,",
    "the most important region of emission will be the region of the electrosphere where the kinetic energy of the particles @xmath45 is on the same order as the temperature .",
    "closer to the core of the nugget , a well - defined fermi surface develops with @xmath46 , and the low - energy excitations that can scatter and radiate are confined to an effectively two - dimensional region of momentum space about the fermi surface . as a result , there is a kinematic suppression of the emissivity from these regions and the emission will not change the order of magnitude estimate we present here . sufficiently deep into the nugget , the plasma frequency will also be large enough that the emitted ev scale photons will be highly virtual and thus rapidly reabsorbed . a detailed discussion of the suppression of emission from the highly dense regions is presented in appendix  [ sec : dense - regions ] .",
    "here we shall estimate the emissivity of a boltzmann gas of positrons .",
    "the boltzmann approximation is valid where @xmath47 and we can neglect both the fermion degeneracy that will suppress the emissivity closer to the core and many - body effects . thus we start from the following expression ) should be contrasted with the well known dipole type of expression for _ different _ types of particles emitting soft photons , such as electrons and ions . with identical particles having the same charge to mass ratio @xmath48 ,",
    "the dipole contribution is zero , and the cross section is dominated by the quadrupole interaction .",
    "this quadrupole character explains the appearance of the velocity @xmath49 in numerator of ( [ eq : spectrum ] ) as opposed to the factor @xmath50 that enters the corresponding expression for electron - ion collisions .",

    "the spectral properties can be calculated from @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the local density at distance @xmath44 from the nugget s surface , and @xmath56 is the relative velocity .",
    "the velocity and momentum @xmath57 need to be thermally averaged . to estimate this , we use the boltzmann ensemble at temperature @xmath58 with a kinematic cutoff @xmath59 , as only particles with sufficient energy can emit photons with energy @xmath60 . in principle",
    "one can do better , but the current approach suffices to give the correct order of magnitude ( see appendix  [ sec : boltzmann - average ] for details ) : @xmath61 where ( this approximation is accurate to about @xmath62 ) @xmath63 to proceed with our estimates , we need the positron density in the nugget s electrosphere at temperature @xmath58 .",
    "as shown in appendix  [ sec : struct - nugg - surf ] , the corresponding expression in the nonrelativistic mean - field approximation is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a constant of integration to be determined by some appropriate boundary condition .",
    "it is known that the mean - field approximation is not valid for extremely large @xmath44 , where exponential rather than power - law ( [ eq : n_r ] ) decay is expected .",
    "we could accommodate the corresponding feature by introducing a cutoff at sufficiently large @xmath66 .",
    "the result , however , is not sensitive to this cutoff , so we shall simply take @xmath67 below to obtain our order of magnitude estimate .",
    "note : the electrosphere extends well beyond the core of the nugget . to see this , note that the boltzmann regime  ( [ eq : n_r ] ) is based on an approximation that neglects the curvature of the nuggets surface ( see appendix  [ sec : struct - nugg - surf ] ) .",
    "this regime terminates only once the curvature becomes significant , i.e. once the electrosphere extends at least to the same order as the macroscopic radius of the nugget .",
    "thus , the electrosphere occupies a significant fraction of the nugget s volume : it is not just a thin outer shell .",
    "corrections from the finite size of the nugget are discussed in appendix  [ sec : finite - size ] but do not affect the magnitude of our calculations .",
    "the parameter @xmath65 is not a free parameter , but is fixed by matching the full density profile to the boundary of the nuclear matter core of the nugget , where the lepton chemical potential @xmath68 is established by beta - equilibrium in the nuclear matter .",
    "a proper computation of @xmath65 thus requires tracking the density through many orders of magnitude from the ultrarelativistic down to the nonrelativistic regime , which is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the order of magnitude , however , is easily estimated by taking @xmath69 as the onset of the boltzmann regime :    [ eq : zbar ] @xmath70{\\frac{t}{m}}.    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    numerically , @xmath71  cm while the density @xmath72  @xmath73 for @xmath74 .",

    "our final estimate for spectral surface emissivity can be expressed as follows : @xmath81{\\frac{t}{m } }    \\left(1+\\frac{\\omega}{t}\\right)e^{-\\omega / t}h\\left(\\frac{\\omega}{t}\\right).\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] integrating over @xmath60 contributes a factor of @xmath82 , giving the total surface emissivity : @xmath83{\\frac{t}{m}}\\\\\\ ] ] although a discussion of black - body radiation is inappropriate for these nuggets ( for one thing , they are too small to establish thermal equilibrium with low - energy photons ) , it is still instructive to compare the form of this surface emissivity with that of black - body radiation @xmath84 : @xmath85{\\frac{t}{m}}.\\ ] ] at @xmath86 , the emissivity @xmath87 is much smaller than that for black - body radiation . the spectral properties of these two emissions are also very different at low frequencies @xmath88 as follows from ( [ eq : p ] ) .",
    "these two differences are essential to explain the wmap  haze .",
    "first , the suppressed total radiant exitance is required to establish the ev temperature scale ( this will be discussed in section  [ sec : therm - nugg ] ) .",
    "second , the extremely long low - frequency tail due to the logarithmic dependence of @xmath89 is required to ensure that sufficient power is radiated in the microwave . thus , as we shall show in  [ sec : comp - wmap - haze ] , it is highly nontrivial that the scale of the emitted microwave emission should be consistent with the observed wmap  haze emission : if the nuggets had been simple black - body emitters , the emission would be many orders of magnitude below the observed scale .",
    "finally , we emphasize here that there are no free parameters in this calculation : all of the scales are set by well - established nuclear and electromagnetic physics .",
    "the only unknown parameters that enter are the overall normalizations which can be fixed by considering the related diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "this is the point of the next section .",
    "armed with an estimate of the total emissivity  ( [ eq : p_t ] ) , we may discuss the thermodynamic properties of the nuggets . in order to maintain the overall energy balance",
    ", the nuggets must emit energy at the same rate that it is deposited through proton annihilation , @xmath90 where @xmath33 is the fraction of the annihilation energy that is thermalized .",
    "note that both the rate of emission and the rate of annihilation are expressed per unit area @xmath91 , so that the equilibrium condition is independent of the nugget size .",
    "the rate of annihilation @xmath92 is @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the energy liberated by proton annihilation , @xmath95 is the speed of the nugget through the visible matter , @xmath96 is the local visible matter density , and @xmath97 is the factor by which the effective cross - section @xmath98 for proton annihilation is reduced from the geometric cross - section @xmath91 due to the possibility of reflection from the sharp quark - matter surface ( in contrast , the positron distribution in the electrosphere is very smooth ) , as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the typical galactic scale for the speed is @xmath99 , while the density at a distance @xmath100 kpc from the center is @xmath101 where we have adopt a scaling behaviour close to that of an isothermal sphere  @xcite for the typical visible matter density in the bulge at a distance @xmath100 kpc from the core , where the observed wmap  haze originates : @xmath102 combining these , we obtain @xmath103 which must be compared with the total surface emissivity  ( [ eq : p_t ] ) @xmath104 taking the typical values @xmath105 and @xmath106  @xmath107 gives the relationship between the temperature and typical parameters describing the nuggets , @xmath108 , @xmath109 as discussed in  @xcite , reasonable values for @xmath110 and @xmath111 all lead to a @xmath112 equilibrium temperature .",
    "the heat - capacity of the nuggets is estimated in appendix  [ sec : heat - capacities ] .",
    "if the gas of positrons occupies a substantial volume of the nugget , then the heat capacity is `` large '' in the sense that it will require many annihilations to raise the temperature of the nuggets to the ev scale at which equilibrium is established .",
    "thus , the antimatter nuggets will act as effective thermal integrators , slowly reaching a relatively constant average temperature @xmath42 ev .",
    "in our proposal , interstellar matter annihilates on antimatter nuggets .",
    "the nuggets then radiate this energy over a wide range of frequencies .",
    "the model thus makes definite predictions relating these emissions : they should have similar morphologies , and the relative intensities should be related by an overall energy budget determined by the local annihilation rate .",

    "we emphasize that these parameters are not free , but they depend on detailed models of the nuggets and are beyond the reach of present day calculational techniques .    by hypothesizing that emissions from the nuggets completely explain the puzzling 511 kev ( b.[item:511 ] ) and diffuse x - ray ( b.[item : x - ray ] ) emissions , one obtains @xmath121 , which is consistent with the theoretical estimates , and provides a nontrivial test of the theory .    neglecting the small corrections to the line - of - sight averaging discussed above",

    "thus , the nontrivial relationship  ( [ eq : chandra - wmap])which depends strongly on the observed intensity of the ghz wmap  haze  is satisfied by the phenomenological parameters determined by considering only the kev scale emissions .",
    "the observed spectrum of the wmap  haze is extremely hard  @xcite .",
    "this feature is easily accommodated in our model by the logarithmic dependence of the thermal bremsstrahlung emission  ( [ eq : p ] ) .",
    "indeed , the wmap  haze was initially interpreted as thermal bremsstrahlung ( free - free emission ) from a hot ( @xmath42 ev ) gas  @xcite ( @xmath137  k@xmath138  k ) , but this interpretation was rejected because a @xmath139 recombination line , which should accompany the haze , is not seen .",
    "( the possibility of much hotter plasmas @xmath140  k has also been ruled out  @xcite . )",
    "it is quite remarkable that the @xmath141  k@xmath142 scale arises natural in our proposal in two completely independent ways : ( [ eq : equilibrium ] ) and ( [ eq : chandra - wmap ] ) .",
    "our proposal , thus , naturally fits the observed spectrum of the wmap  haze , without any @xmath139 recombination line since the emission is from a purely positronic gas .",
    "it is also remarkable that the spectrum exactly corresponds with bremsstrahlung radiation , as was originally suggested in @xcite to fit the data .",
    "our proposal also makes a definite prediction about the morphologies of the various emissions .",
    "in particular , the morphology of the `` direct '' emissions b.  [ item:511]b .  [ item : gev ] should be almost identical .",
    "as discussed in appendix  [ sec : line - sight - integr ] , even though the wmap  haze is a thermal emission , the dependence on the line - of - sight matter distribution is quite weak , and our model thus also predicts that the morphology of the wmap  haze be closely correlated with the morphology of the `` direct '' emissions .    ultimately , if our proposal is correct , the morphology of all of the emissions are direct probes of the matter distributions in our galaxy , and may thus become a useful measuring tool .",
    "we have now demonstrated that our proposal naturally and nontrivially explains diffuse galactic radiations  b.[item:511]b .",
    "[ item : wmap ] over thirteen orders of magnitude from microwave ( @xmath143  ev ) to gev scales .",
    "the only `` parameter '' in our model is the overall size of the nuggets , and the dependence of the observations on this parameter can virtually be eliminated by comparing observations along the similar lines - of - sight to the core of the galaxy .",
    "comparisons along the same line - of - sight also virtually eliminate uncertainties related to the distribution of matter in our galaxy . removing this uncertainty ,",
    "our proposal depends on only a couple of parameters : @xmath30 and @xmath144 .",
    "these represent presently intractable calculations , but have tight upper bounds and can vary by no more than an order of magnitude or so . and",
    "@xmath32 can , in principle , be calculated from the first principles .",
    "however , such a computation is extremely difficult as it requires solving the many - body problem in a strongly coupled regime .",
    "indeed , the phase diagram of quark matter in the relevant regime is still largely unknown . even with these reservations , we still are quite confident that these parameters can not deviate much from their `` natural '' values . in this respect",
    "our proposal is predictive : there is little freedom to change these parameters .",
    "this is in contrast with most other dark matter proposals where parameters can be arbitrary changed by many orders of magnitude to exploring an enormously large , and largely unconstrained parameter space . ]    together with our previous work  @xcite , we now have several constraints on these parameters by postulating that matter annihilation on dark - antimatter nuggets explains significant proportions of puzzling diffuse emissions .",
    "these constraints provide a highly nontrivial test of our proposal .",
    "the diffuse 511 kev emission  b.[item:511 ] observed by spi / integral  has been identified as primarily due to positronium annihilation .",
    "the puzzle is how positrons come to be diffusely distributed through the core of our galaxy .",
    "we propose that the positron electrosphere of dark - antimatter nuggets provide the source of positrons .",
    "this source is distributed diffusely , and produces a definite spectrum consistent with the observed spectrum  @xcite that is independent of any model - specific parameters .",
    "one prediction is that the spectrum is independent of observed direction .",
    "another is that the intensity is determined by the product @xmath145 of the distribution visible and dark matter .",
    "we use this emission as a baseline to which we compare the other emissions in order to remove the uncertainties of the nugget size and the matter distribution along the line of sight to the galactic core .",
    "associated with this emission is the mev spectrum from direct e@xmath27e@xmath28 annihilation  b.[item : mev ] .",
    "this spectrum is model independent , and consistent with observations and background models , possibly explaining the 120 mev energy deficits seen in the comptel  data @xcite .",
    "the diffuse kev x - ray emissions  b.[item : x - ray ] measured by _",
    "chandra _  are puzzling because of the implied energy budget .",
    "the spectrum looks like a thermal @xmath146 plasma  @xcite , but such a plasma would not even be gravitationally bound and would require a huge unidentified source of energy to fuel .",
    "we propose that this emission is due to bremsstrahlung emission from positrons excited from protons annihilating on the dark - antimatter nuggets  @xcite .",
    "the spectrum for this process is also largely independent of model - specific parameters , is consistent with the observations , and is also independent of position .",
    "comparing this emission the 511 kev emission gives one constraint on the parameters @xmath147  @xcite , @xmath148 that is satisfied by their natural scales @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "the morphologies should also be related , depending on the product @xmath145 .",
    "the direct emission of gev photons from proton annihilation  b.[item : gev ] is consistent with gamma ray observations by egret , explaining up to one tenth or so of the observed spectrum  @xcite .",
    "the annihilation energy not released through one of the previous sources of emission ultimately thermalizes . as shown in section  [ sec : therm - nugg ] , the nuggets reach equilibrium with a typical @xmath112 scale through the constraint  ( [ eq : equilibrium ] ) , @xmath151 which is again satisfied by the natural parameter scales .",
    "we emphasize that this constraint is virtually model independent , depending on only the emissivity calculated in section  [ sec : therm - emiss - from ] and the properties of the matter distribution in the core of the galaxy .",
    "the emissivity is dominated by the properties of the nugget electrosphere in the low - density regime , where calculations are under order - of - magnitude control .",
    "although not particularly sensitive to the emissivity , the scale set by  ( [ eq : equilibrium ] ) would be altered by an order of magnitude if the emissivity were black - body .",
    "the constraints described in section  [ sec : summary ] did not involve any measurements of the wmap  haze .",
    "thus , the temperature @xmath152  ( [ eq : equilibrium ] ) allows us to unambiguously predict the energy emitted in the tail of the thermal distribution in the microwave band .",
    "amazingly , comparing this with the observed wmap  haze gives ( [ eq : chandra - wmap ] ) @xmath153 which is satisfied with the natural values of the parameters , even though the frequencies are at a scale many orders of magnitude smaller than the scale at which the parameters were constrained .",
    "unlike  ( [ eq : equilibrium ] ) , this estimate is extremely sensitive to the flat spectral properties of the thermal emission  ( [ eq : p ] ) at small frequencies @xmath154 : a very specific feature of thermal bremsstrahlung emission . if the spectrum were not flat , there is no way that this constraint would be satisfied .",
    "another difference between the two estimates  ( [ eq : equilibrium ] ) and ( [ eq : chandra - wmap ] ) is that the former is sensitive overall normalization of ( [ eq : p_t ] ) whereas the latter is sensitive to the detailed shape of the spectrum  ( [ eq : p ] ) .",
    "we also emphasize that the constraints ( [ eq : equilibrium ] ) and ( [ eq : chandra - wmap ] ) not only deal with emissions from scales separated by 8 orders of magnitude , but that condition ( [ eq : chandra - wmap ] ) depends on observed intensity of the wmap  haze which has absolutely nothing to do with the estimate  ( [ eq : equilibrium ] ) . that these two estimates agree with each other and with the estimates in  @xcite , ( where the intensity of the diffuse kev x - rays were compared with the 511 kev emission ) ,",
    "is truly remarkable .",
    "in addition to satisfying the constraints described in the previous section , our proposal also makes the definite prediction that the morphologies of the 511  flux , the 120 mev @xmath26-ray emission , and the x - ray flux should all be identical , following the distribution @xmath145 of visible and dark matter .",
    "the morphology of the wmap  should be similar but may differ slightly because of the different line - of - sight integral  ( [ eq : thermal_integral ] ) .",
    "for example , _ chandra _  has detected a diffuse x - ray emission with flux @xmath155  erg/@xmath156/s / deg@xmath157 from a region of the disk @xmath158 off the center  @xcite .",
    "this is one order of magnitude smaller than the observations from the core of the galaxy , and so our model predicts that the microwave emission from this region is about one order of magnitude smaller than the wmap  haze from the galactic core , which seems consistent with the observations  @xcite .",
    "finally , this proposal makes definite testable predictions for the properties of the emitted spectra .",
    "in particular , all bands but the wmap  haze are produced on an event - by - event basis , and are thus independent of the rate at which the annihilation processes occur .",
    "the observed spectra should thus be largely _ independent of the direction of observation .",
    "_ only the intensity should vary as a function of the collision rate , and this should be correlated with the visible / dark - matter distribution as discussed above .",
    "the wmap  haze will have a slight spectral dependence , but only through the temperature dependence @xmath159 which is quite weak .",
    "our dark matter proposal not only explains many astrophysical and cosmological puzzles , but makes definite predictions about the correlations of the dark and visible matter distributions @xmath160 with five different bands of radiation ranging over 13 orders of magnitude in frequency .",
    "in addition , it makes the definite prediction that these spectra of the emissions should be virtually independent of the local environment .",
    "such correlations and spectral properties would be very difficult to account for with other dark - matter candidates .",
    "future observations may thus easily confirm or rule out this theory .",
    "if confirmed , it would provide a key for many cosmological and astrophysical secrets , and finally unlock the nature of dark matter .",

    ". the plasma frequency can be thought as an effective mass for the photon : only photons with energy larger than this mass can propagate outside of the system .",
    "photons with @xmath246 are `` off - shell '' or `` virtual '' : these can only propagate for a short period of time / distance @xmath247 before they decay .    to derive the analogues of equations ( [ eq : p ] ) and ( [ eq : p_t ] ) for the denser regions , we must start with ( [ eq : spectrum ] ) , but insert the proper form for the expression for @xmath248 , including these effects : @xmath249 where @xmath250 and @xmath251 are the colliding positron quasiparticle energies above the fermi surface .",
    "the factor of @xmath252 accounts for energy conservation : the initial energy must be larger than the energy of emitted photon ; and the factor @xmath253 accounts for the effects of the plasma frequency . only photons with @xmath254 can propagate in the dense media : photons with smaller energies will be absorbed on distances @xmath247 .",
    "as we shall see , this leads to an exponential suppression of emission @xmath255 when @xmath256 .",
    "as such , we have omitted the aforementioned lpm suppression and additional pauli blocking effects , as these are comparatively insignificant .",
    "the integral in ( [ eq : n ] ) can be estimated from @xmath257 to give @xmath258 the main point is that @xmath259 grows with the density as @xmath260 in the nonrelativistic regimes , and as @xmath261{n}$ ] in the relativistic regimes .",
    "this leads to an exponential suppression of emission from the dense regions of the nugget .",
    "the suppression is lifted only when @xmath262 which occurs ( as can be verified numerically ) only when the densities are sufficiently low that the boltzmann approximation is valid .",
    "our estimates ( [ eq : p ] ) and ( [ eq : p_t ] ) , which are based on this approximation , are thus justified .",
    "one can estimate that the plasma frequency @xmath259 is a few ev for densities ( [ eq : n_z ] ) typical of the boltzmann regime .",
    "given our previous discussion , one might ask : how can low - energy photons @xmath246 still be emitted ?",
    "the reason is that , although these photons would be reabsorbed in infinite matter , this reabsorption happens on a length scale of @xmath263 . at the typical densities in the boltzmann regime , @xmath264  cm is sufficiently large compared with the nugget size that many of these photons will have left the nugget before being reabsorbed .",
    "one can interpret this effect as a decay of a quasistationary state in quantum mechanics through the tunnelling process , where the barrier has a size comparable with inverse energy of the quasistationary state .",
    "the suppression factor only becomes sufficiently large when @xmath265 .",
    "then the reabsorption happens well before the photons emerge .",
    "this is the origin of the primary suppression in the very dense regions we have just discussed .",
    "here we make a rough estimate of the heat capacity of the nuggets . at ev temperatures ,",
    "the only modes that can be excited are the neutral nambu - goldstone superfluid mode , which contributes as @xmath266 , and the gapless positrons at their fermi surface of @xmath267 .",
    "it is the gapless positrons that will dominate the low - temperature heat capacity of the nuggets .    to estimate the heat capacity , we simply count the number of low - energy modes .",
    "the heat capacity density for a single mode with dispersion @xmath268 is @xmath269 the total heat capacity @xmath270 is obtained by integrating this over the volume @xmath271 . here",
    "are some approximate contributions to the heat capacity from the nuclear core , assuming the density @xmath272@xmath273 is a few times nuclear density so that @xmath274 , and taking @xmath275 ev :    single boson : : :    for a single boson , @xmath276 .",
    "this gives    @xmath277 and a total contribution of    @xmath278 .",
    "two fermions : : :    for a pair of positrons with fermi surface @xmath279 we have    @xmath280 which gives    @xmath281 and a total contribution of    @xmath282 where we take the fermi velocity    @xmath283 for relativistic systems and    @xmath284 mev .    in the complete absence of positrons ,",
    "the heat capacity of a medium nugget @xmath285 would be about unity , meaning that the addition of @xmath286 of thermal energy would raise the temperature by a gev , however , even if the core of the nuggets is completely neutral ( for example , if the colour - flavour - locked ( cfl ) phase were realized with equal numbers of up , down , and strange quarks ) , the surface of the quark - matter core will still be charged , requiring a large number of positrons in the electrosphere to neutralize the objects .",
    "once one includes the contribution of the positrons , however , the heat capacity becomes much larger , and the input of @xmath286 of energy will only effect a very small change in temperature .",
    "for example , if positrons are present in the core , even the very smallest possible nuggets is quite strong and comes from negative terrestrial based search results  @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath287 would heat by only an ev given @xmath286 of energy .",
    "we expect the nuggets have a typical size of @xmath14 @xcite , so nuggets would require many collisions in order to reach the ev temperature scales at which they would thermally equilibrate by balancing the annihilation energy input with the thermal radiation  ( [ eq : equilibrium ] ) .    note , however , that while the heat capacity is large in the sense that many collisions are required to heat the nuggets to the equilibrium ev scale , it is small enough to allow the nuggets to heat to this temperature quickly on galactic scales . to see this ,",
    "consider the total annihilation rate  ( [ eq : fann1 ] ) .",
    "@xmath288 where @xmath91 is the surface area of the nuggets @xmath289 therefore , the typical time between annihilations is on the order of 1 per second for nuggets with @xmath290 .",
    "a nugget with positrons throughout ( corresponding to a larger heat capacity ) would require @xmath291 to reach ev temperatures .",
    "thus the nuggets reach their equilibrium quite rapidly once they enter a region of high visible matter density .",
    "a comparison between the `` direct '' emissions b.[item:511]b.[item : gev ] is facilitated by the fact that they depend on the same line - of - sight average  ( [ eq : direct_integral ] ) @xmath292 in principle , comparing these with thermal emissions is more difficult because the line - of - sight integral has an additional dependence on the visible matter distribution .",
    "this arises because the emissivity depends on the temperature @xmath58 of the nuggets , which in turn depends on the annihilation rate through the thermal equilibrium condition  ( [ eq : equilibrium ] ) .    as can be seen from  ( [ eq : p_t ] ) , ( [ eq : ftotfann ] ) and ( [ eq : fann1 ] ) , the temperature of the nuggets is related to the local visible matter density as @xmath293 , whereas from  ( [ eq : p ] ) , we see that the microwave emission scales as @xmath294 . thus , the microwave emission depends on the line - of - sight integral @xmath295n_{{\\textsc{vm}}}^{-4/17}(l).\\ ] ] of course",
    ", one must also account for rescattering , absorption and other effects along the line - of - sight , but our point is that the difference between the line - of - sight averaging of the `` direct '' emissions and the `` thermal '' emissions is highly suppressed  depending only on @xmath296 .",
    "this allows us to directly compare all emissions in order to estimate the order of magnitude for the energy budget discussed in section  [ sec : energy - budget ] .",
    "once the other calculations and observations are better constrained , one might be able to search for this type of scaling to test our proposal more rigorously ."
