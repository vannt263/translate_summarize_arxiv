    "this is the second in a pair of articles that classifies the symmetries of a model system of identical particles trapped in one - dimension and interacting via galilean - invariant two - body interactions .",
    "the first article motivated the study of this system and its symmetries and it considered examples and applications with one , two and three particles .",
    "this article formalizes and extends these results to the case of @xmath0 particles , with multiple examples for @xmath1 .",
    "the hamiltonian under study is @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the non - interacting hamiltonian .",
    "it is the sum of identical one - particle hamiltonians @xmath4 that each include the one - particle trapping potential @xmath5 .",
    "the interacting hamiltonian @xmath6 includes the sum of identical pairwise interaction potentials @xmath7 the specific case of contact interactions is treated in detail , but many results hold for _ any _ galilean invariant interaction potential @xmath8 .",
    "the goal is to classify the symmetries of @xmath9 and @xmath6 for asymmetric , symmetric and harmonic traps .",
    "two kinds of symmetries are considered : configuration space symmetries , which are realized as orthogonal transformations of configuration space @xmath10 , and kinematic symmetries , which are the full group of all unitary transformations that commute with @xmath9 or @xmath6 . despite their importance and intrinsic interest , neither this article nor its prequel consider dynamical ( a.k.a .",
    "spectrum - generating ) symmetries .",
    "key to the methods and results of this article is the assumption that each one particle hamiltonian @xmath4 has a discrete , non - degenerate energy spectrum @xmath11 .",
    "the configuration space symmetry @xmath12 is either trivial @xmath13 for asymmetric traps or it is parity @xmath14 for symmetric traps .",
    "the kinematic symmetry group @xmath15 is time translation @xmath16 for asymmetric traps , parity and time translation @xmath17 for symmetric traps , or the unitary group and time translation for the harmonic trap @xmath18 .",
    "see sections 2 of the previous article for more details about one particle symmetries .",
    "the results for @xmath19 and @xmath20 in the previous article could be established by direct calculation and enumeration .",
    "however , that is not practical for higher @xmath0 . the goal is to develop algebraic methods that can be implemented on a computer , but this requires a degree of formality and abstraction that some physicists may find unfamiliar or unappealing , i.e.  the ` gruppenpest ' . to try and bridge that gap ,",
    "the second section of this article starts out with an overview of the permutation group and its representations . a particular class of representations called permutation modules turn out to be intuitive and useful , especially when",
    "the tools of state permutation symmetry and the double tableau basis are employed .",
    "this section also discussed how to apply these results to the case where the @xmath0 identical particles are fermions or bosons and have an internal structure that does not participate in the interaction , like spin .",
    "the third section considers the non - interacting hamiltonian @xmath9 and shows that the configuration space symmetry group @xmath21 and the kinematic symmetry group @xmath22 are always larger groups than the following minimal constructions @xmath23 in words , these symmetry groups are at least the semidirect product of the particle permutation group @xmath24 acting on the direct product of @xmath0 copies of the single particle symmetry group @xmath12 or @xmath15 .",
    "the previous article developed this structure by analysis of two and three particle systems , where the group elements can be easily explicitly enumerated . in this article , the general result is established by using representation theory for @xmath25 applied to permutation modules . the degeneracies of the non - interacting spectrum @xmath26 must be explained by the dimensionality of the irreducible representations of @xmath22 .",
    "when @xmath21 or @xmath22 is larger than the minimal construction , then there is either an emergent few - particle symmetry or an accidental symmetry . table 1 summarizes results for @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 non - interacting particles .",
    "the fourth section shows that there is also a minimal construction for the configuration space symmetry group @xmath30 and the kinematic symmetry group @xmath31 of the interacting hamiltonian @xmath6 : @xmath32 the interactions break individual particle symmetries and the non - interacting energy levels are split into irreducible representations of the smaller group @xmath31 .",
    "table 2 summarizes these results for @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 interacting particles .",
    "this reduction of symmetry can be exploited to make approximation schemes like exact diagonalization scale more efficiently for the same level of accuracy and to find algebraic results for level - splitting under weak perturbations .",
    "the fifth section considers the unitary limit of the contact interaction , with hamiltonian denoted @xmath33 . in this limit",
    ", the ordering of particles becomes a good quantum number and a new kinematic symmetry emerges for finite - energy states @xmath34 the additional symmetry @xmath35 is called ordering permutation symmetry , and it provides and alternate set of observables that can be used to analyze how the @xmath36-fold degenerate energy levels split into less degenerate levels and bands in the ` near unitarity ' limit .    throughout the article the question is asked , what results are universal ?",
    "specifically , when is there enough symmetry for the spectrum of @xmath6 to be calculated from the properties of the one - particle system ? which properties are required for which approximations , and what can be said without specific knowledge of the trap shape or the interaction ?",
    "how does this change with increasing particles or spin components ?",
    "the short answer is that the non - interacting limit and the unitary limit of the contact interaction are algebraically universal for any @xmath0 .",
    "only the single particle spectrum @xmath37 is required in order for the machinery of group representation theory to construct a complete set of commuting observables for those two limits .",
    "for other interactions , the interplay of the trap shape , number of particles , and specific interaction determine whether algebraically universal expressions exist for properties like level splitting of multicomponent particles under weak perturbations or near - unitary perturbations .",
    "the previous article discusses one , two and three particles and group representation theory techniques is employed to make well - known or intuitive results seems reasonable and inevitable . for two and three particles , it is relatively easy to achieve results by manual calculation or enumeration ; the biggest composition subspaces for three particle are only six - dimensional .",
    "when we get to four particles , the possibility for 24-fold degenerate energy levels , even without accidental or emergent symmetries , encourages us to develop more sophisticated techniques . at the core of these techniques",
    "is the theory of the symmetric group and its representations .",
    "this section develops the necessary framework to extend results for two and three particles to four and more .",
    "the hamiltonian is invariant under particle permutations @xmath24 for every kind of trap and for any galilean - invariant interactions .",
    "therefore the configuration space symmetry group and the kinematic symmetry group have the abstract group @xmath38 as a subgroup as a physical symmetry and @xmath38 as the abstract group is useful because state permutation symmetry @xmath39 and ordering permutation symmetry @xmath40 are also isomorphic to a symmetric group . ] .",

    "one way to specify the focus of this article is to ask the series of questions :    * given only the symmetries , what can we say about the @xmath0-particle spectrum @xmath419 ?",
    "how much about the energies , degeneracies and states for the interacting system can be inferred without any specific knowledge of the one - particle spectrum @xmath37 ? how does the spectrum change when the interaction strength is tuned adiabatically or rapidly quenched ? * if we also know the specific spectrum @xmath37 in addition to the symmetries , how much more can we say about the spectrum @xmath419 ? and how much more if we also know the wave functions @xmath420 of the one - particle energy eigenstates @xmath421 ?",
    "* finally , what if we know the explicit form of the two - body interaction @xmath219 and/or can calculate the two - body matrix elements @xmath422 between noninteracting states ?    as a general conceptual framework , the less we have to know about the specifics of the trap or interaction , the more ` universal ' the results .",
    "what this article demonstrates is how this notion of universality breaks down for most interacting system as the number of particles is increased and the symmetries of the trap and interaction are reduced .    despite its length ,",
    "this article has left out many relevant topics , like the @xmath423 dynamical symmetry of the contact potential in a harmonic trap , lattice symmetries , supersymmetric potentials in one dimensions , and the possibility of interaction symmetries that depend on the internal structure of the particles .",
    "further , these symmetry classifications could be generalized to higher dimensions .",
    "symmetry should be less constraining as the number of degrees of freedom grows and algebraic universality may break down sooner . also ,",
    "the effect of intrinsic three or higher few - body interactions on the spectrum would be interesting to incorporate into symmetry analysis to seek possible manifestation in spectral shifts .",
    "however , without adding to the complication of the one - dimensional trap , two - body interaction model , there is still much work to be done .",
    "efficient methods of state construction are required for perturbation theory and exact diagonalization and for calculating reduced density matrices , correlation functions , and entanglement spectra among particles and between spin and spatial observables . another possible avenue for future",
    "work is to exploit the close connection between finite groups and number theory .",
