    "robustness is one of the key issues for network maintenance and design  @xcite .",
    "the representation of complex systems has been limited to single networks for a long time  @xcite .",
    "in many cases , however , coupling between several networks takes place  @xcite .",
    "an important case is that of interdependency  @xcite where there are two kinds of links : connectivity and dependency links .",
    "an example of interdependent networks is the ensemble of the internet and the power supply grid where telecommunication is used to control power plants and electric power is needed to supply communication devices  @xcite .",
    "connectivity links model the relation of the entities within the same sector , spanning in the above example a power supply network and a telecommunication network .",
    "dependency links depict the basic supplies an entity depends on which are supplied by entities in the other network .",
    "if a supplier fails its dependent nodes fail as well .",
    "the system is viable if a giant component of interconnected units exists in both networks . in the 28 september 2003 blackout in italy it came to evidence that the interdependency of the two networks makes them more vulnerable than ever thought before  @xcite .",
    "similar relations occur in the economics between banks and firms or funds .",
    "banks are related through interbank loans , firms through supply chains and the interdependence comes from loans and securities .",
    "inappropriate asset proportions can also lead to global avalanches as seen in the subprime mortgage crisis  @xcite .    interconnecting similar subsystems used to increase capacity",
    "was shown beneficial as long as it does not open pathways to cascades  @xcite . however , in interdependent networks , the aspect of robustness was considered with the conclusion that broadening the degree distribution of the initial networks enhances vulnerability  @xcite . a cost - intensive intervention to strengthen robustness is to upgrade nodes to be autonomous on some resources @xcite .",
    "because failures propagate rapidly in infrastructure networks , they can not be stopped by installing backup devices during the spreading of the damage .",
    "but rather they require already existing systems .",
    "after the cascade of failures , damaged devices or elements can be replaced by new , functioning ones _ identical _ to the originals  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to engineered systems , social or economic networks are highly responsive and may react quickly  @xcite .",
    "when a failure occurs considerable effort is made to reorganize the network and rearrange the load of failing elements among functioning ones .",
    "the role of the failing entities is taken over by _ similar _ participants .",
    "such processes can be modeled by healing , i.e. , substituting some of the failed elements by new ones .",
    "the timescale of an economic crisis is wide enough for the network to completely restructure itself  @xcite .",
    "so far such mechanisms have only been studied for simple networks  @xcite . here",
    "we extend the original model  @xcite of cascading failures of interdependent networks .",
    "after each removal , the healing process attempts to bypass the removed node with a new connectivity link ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cascade_schema ] ) . in this paper , we demonstrate how healing acts on interdependent networks .",
    "_ a ) _ failures , represented by red dots , affect the nodes one by one in a random order .",
    "whenever a node fails , its counterpart , that is , the node in the other network which depends on it , fails as well . in both networks ,",
    "only the largest connected component ( lcc ) survives .",
    "this constraint can cause further nodes to fail in both networks , which trigger further shrinking of the lcc , and so on , illustrated by the shaded areas . _",
    "b ) _ the neighbors of a failing node try to heal the network , such that two functioning neighbors of a removed node establish a connectivity link with probability @xmath0 . ]    the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we define the node failure process in a dynamic way .",
    "we introduce initial failures one by one to be able to apply healing at every failure event .",
    "then we relate the original version of cascading failures to our model as a special case and give formulas for comparing the order parameter of the two models .",
    "the scaling properties of the healing are explained along with the numeric results in sec .",
    "[ sec : scaling ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : cascades ] we discuss the properties of the cascades with microscopic insight to the model .",
    "finally we conclude our findings in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in the standard model of interdependent networks  @xcite the computer - generated model - system is built up of two topologically identical networks @xmath2 and @xmath3 , e.g. , square lattices of size @xmath4 , where each node has _ connectivity _",
    "links within the same network . in addition , _ dependency _ links couple between the networks , which are bidirectional one - to - one relationships connecting randomly selected pairs of nodes from the two networks .",
    "if any of the nodes fails its dependent pair fails too .",
    "a node in any network can function only if it is connected to the largest connected component of that network the node which it depends on is also functional , otherwise it fails , i.e. , it is removed from the network .",
    "the existence of a macroscopic connected component in a single network is treated by percolation theory . in the usual case ,",
    "for a lattice it describes a second - order phase transition between the phases with and without the existence of a giant component  @xcite .",
    "adding interdependency allows cascades of failures to propagate between the two networks .",
    "the threshold the network can survive without collapse decreases considerably in this setting  @xcite .",
    "the collapse due to cascades was shown to be a first order transition if the dependency links have unlimited range while the transition is of second order if the range is less than a critical length @xmath5  @xcite . moreover",
    ", the first order transition has a hybrid character with scaling on one of its sides  @xcite .",
    "part of network @xmath2 of a simulated system at @xmath6 at _ a ) _ no healing ( @xmath7 ) _ b ) _ below the critical healing ( @xmath8 , the average degree stays below @xmath9 ) and _ c ) _ slightly above the critical healing ( @xmath10 ) . _",
    "d ) _ this latter @xmath10 system is also represented at @xmath11 where one can observe that the nodes get more and more connected and the healing process establishes links between distant nodes . ]",
    "as mentioned in the introduction we first introduce a dynamic process on the interdependent network model . in the setting of two interdependent networks of general topology this dynamic process consists of the repetition of attacks and relaxations to a rest via cascades .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cascade_schema ] . )",
    "let us suppose that failures affect the nodes one by one in a random order which defines a timeline .",
    "one time step is identified with the external attack of one node .",
    "time is measured by the number of time steps normalized by @xmath12 for systems of different sizes to be comparable : @xmath13 the externally introduced failure in network @xmath2 may separate the largest connected component ( lcc ) into two or more parts where only the largest one survives .",
    "all the failed nodes have dependency connections to nodes of the network @xmath3 causing their failure .",
    "again , the lcc of @xmath3 may get fragmented and only the largest part survives .",
    "this cascading procedure is repeated until no more failures happen .",
    "of course , our model can easily be generalized to any number of interdependent networks and any density of dependency links .",
    "our aim is to introduce healing into this dynamic model .",
    "the procedure is as follows : after an externally introduced failure ( which may cut off a part of the lcc ) the healing step follows . two remaining , functioning neighbors of a removed node",
    "establish a connectivity link with an independent probability @xmath0 .",
    "( see part _",
    "b ) _ in fig .",
    "[ fig : cascade_schema ] . )",
    "then the dependent nodes of the removed nodes are removed from the other network .",
    "after the propagation of the failure there , again , two functioning neighbors of a removed node establish a connectivity link probability @xmath0 .",
    "due to the separation of small components , further damages might propagate back and forth within the network , always followed by a healing step . here",
    ", the healing step means that all pairs of neighbors of each failed node is considered as a candidate for a new connectivity link with an independent probability @xmath0 , then , after having selected the candidates , the connectivity links are established simultaneously .",
    "the process goes on until no more separation of components occurs .",
    "the healing links may change the topology considerably , bridging larger and larger distances as the time goes on ( fig .",
    "[ fig : insight ] ) .",
    "once a critical fraction @xmath14 of nodes are removed , a catastrophic cascade destroys the remaining system .",
    "the @xmath15 case is simply the dynamic version of the well studied model of li _",
    "et al._. in @xcite a fraction @xmath16 of the original network is destroyed in the first step then the size of the giant component after the relaxation of cascades is traced as a function of @xmath17 .",
    "the important difference between this procedure and ours is that in the version of li _ et al . _",
    "nodes may be accidentally attacked , which already fail in our step - by - step ( dynamic ) model .",
    "let @xmath18 denote the fraction of remaining nodes as a function of the fraction of attacked nodes @xmath19 in the step - by - step model .",
    "the number of unattacked but disconnected nodes is @xmath20n$ ] .",
    "the probability of randomly destroying an already disconnected ( but not attacked ) node is @xmath21 , so the implicit relation between the two attacking methods is @xmath22 due to the small false target ratio in the random attack , the threshold values of the two models are close .",
    "the extrapolated threshold value for the infinite system size in case @xmath15 is @xmath23 , in good agreement with the result of li _",
    "the order parameter @xmath18 of our model depends not only on the fraction of attacked nodes but also on the healing parameter .",
    "according to one s intuition , the data show that the critical attack @xmath14 increases monotonically with @xmath0 .",
    "we executed monte carlo simulations of our model with both periodic and open boundary conditions on square lattices starting networks of linear size @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 with @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 runs respectively , and we measured that the execution time in our implementation scaled approximately as @xmath34 . in the square lattices connectivity links join nodes to their nearest neighbors within the same network .",
    "dependency links were established by first creating the trivial mapping between the topologically identical lattices , then randomly shuffling the end of the links .",
    "the @xmath35-s are then obtained averaging over the _ vertical _ axis : for a given number of surviving nodes @xmath36 , we averaged the proportion of nodes @xmath37 attacked one - by - one .",
    "[ fig : orderparam ] shows the averaged curves for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "the shape of the @xmath36 curves suggests the scaling in the form of anisotropic resizing from the @xmath38 point : @xmath39 which is asymptotically satisfied in the @xmath40 limit .    in the infinite lattice limit",
    ", the initial few attacks almost surely occur in different parts of the lattice and do not raise cascades , only the attacked points fail , @xmath41 if @xmath42 . the unit slope at @xmath43 with respect to @xmath44 can be expressed by differentiation and yields @xmath45 .",
