    "cooperation between two epidemics occurs when the spread of one disease increases the spreading of the other .",
    "it was estimated in 2011 @xcite that , about one - third of a total world population of 7 billion people had active tuberculosis ( tb ) .",
    "but if one restricted oneself to the @xmath0 million people with human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) , about 30% also had active or latent tb .",
    "inversely , of the active tb cases , about 15 % also had hiv , which is nearly a factor of 100 higher than the incidence rate in the total population .",
    "people with hiv and tb co - infection typically also experience faster disease progression than those with tb or hiv alone .",
    "another dramatic example where two diseases mutually enhance their spreading is hiv and hepatitis c virus ( hcv)@xcite . also there , it is estimated that about one third of all people with hiv are also co - infected with hcv .",
    "these numbers show already that mutual co - infection is a huge problem .",
    "but there are also other recent examples like hiv and hepatitis b @xcite , while historically the case of spanish flu and tb was one of the most devastating @xcite .",
    "therefore , much effort recently has been devoted to studying the dynamics of spreading of two or more co - operating pathogens @xcite .",
    "let us discuss just a few of these papers .",
    "_ @xcite assumed an asymmetric rule for cooperation , such that the first disease spreads independently of the second one , but the second can propagate only among those that had already been infected with the first disease .",
    "this simplifies the analysis , of course , but prevents the most dramatic scenarios that may occur if the cooperation is mutual and symmetric , as assumed in @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed a framework , based on the heterogeneous mean - field approximation , for the spontaneous spreading of two diseases and studied different effects of one disease on the spreading of the other .",
    "also , in @xcite and @xcite , each disease can spread independently of the other , but the secondary infection rates are enhanced compared to the rates for infection by the first diseases .",
    "such a model was treated in mean field theory in @xcite , while detailed simulations in various types of networks are reported in @xcite .",
    "the main result in @xcite was that the typical  continuous \" phase transition observed in simple epidemic models can be replaced  depending on details of the networks and of the infection processes  by  discontinuous \" ones , where the incidence rate at threshold does not increase continuously but jumps immediately to a finite value . in typical discontinuous ( or  first order \" ) phase transitions , there is no sign of warning  like enhanced fluctuations , an increasing correlation length or a slowing down of the dynamics , which occur in single epidemics @xcite  as the threshold for large - scale spreading is approached .",
    "this is of course the most worrying aspect for health policies , but fortunately most of the discontinuous transitions found in @xcite were  hybrid \" , i.e. they combined the jumps of first order transitions with the anomalies in the approach to the threshold seen in continuous ( or  second order \" ) transitions .",
    "the results in @xcite are extremely interesting , but most were obtained either by some sort of mean field theory ( i.e. , all network properties were neglected and/or stochastic fluctuations were assumed to be absent ) or by simulating very specific cases .",
    "the range of phenomena found in @xcite strongly suggests that one should look for analytic results that do take into account fluctuations and at least some simple network structure .",
    "this is the main aim of the present paper .",
    "another aim is to understand the links between co - infections and catastrophic cascades in networks with interdependencies @xcite .",
    "the latter can be understood most easily @xcite as  viable \" clusters in multiplex networks .",
    "multiplex networks @xcite have nodes of one type and multiple types of edges .",
    "they can be treated as a superposition of several network layers , where nodes are coupled to their counterparts in different layers .",
    "hence multiplex networks can be represented as edge - colored multigraphs , where each edge color corresponds to a network layer . here",
    "we consider a multiplex network with two types of edges , such that each type of edge allows for spreading of one of two types of agents . a cluster in such a network",
    "is called viable @xcite , if each of its nodes can be reached from any other node by both types of agents .",
    "obviously there is an analogy with cooperating coinfections , if we identify the two agents with the two pathogens : in the limit of strong cooperativity , large infected clusters will always be coinfected , i.e. each node on such a cluster will be reachable by both pathogens propagating only on the cluster .",
    "but the detailed nature of this connection has remained elusive up to now .",
    "it is clarified in the present paper .    finally , we should also point out that the case of co - operating epidemics is very much different from the case of competing or antagonistic epidemics @xcite .",
    "although the latter are also of huge practical interest , their dynamics is very different and leads in general to less dramatic effects .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce a co - infection model on a multiplex network with two types of edges and present an analytical framework enabling us to describe the nature of the transitions corresponding to the emergence of co - infected clusters .",
    "we apply our general results to the erds ",
    "rnyi multiplex networks .",
    "the paper is concluded in sec .",
    "let us consider an uncorrelated multiplex network having two types of edges @xmath1 .",
    "the network can be treated as a superposition of two network layers with edges of type @xmath2 and @xmath3 , such that overlapping of two types of edges can exist for some pairs of nodes .",
    "we define degree @xmath4 , as the number of edges of type @xmath5 that are incident to a node and @xmath6 denotes the number of overlapped edges of each node .",
    "the multiplex network is completely described by the joint degree distribution @xmath7 , and we assume that each layer has a locally treelike structure in the infinite network limit .",
    "a co - infection model is defined for two diseases @xmath2 and @xmath3 , spreading on the multiplex network .",
    "each of @xmath5 diseases spreads with transmission probability @xmath8 through only edges of type @xmath5 , while the overlapped edges can transmit both diseases with probability @xmath9 .",
    "we assume that both diseases follow the susceptible@xmath10infective@xmath10recovered ( sir ) dynamics @xcite .",
    "a given random node can be infected with disease @xmath5 , if it has at least one edge of type @xmath5 , connecting it to its infected neighbors .",
    "we assume that during the spreading process , if a node can receive both diseases , each one through at least one edge of each type @xmath5 , it receives the diseases with a higher probability , such that the transmissibilities @xmath11 and @xmath12 are increased by factor @xmath13 .",
    "also , through the overlapped edges both diseases can be transmitted with the enhanced transmissibility @xmath14 .",
    "it was shown that there is a mapping between the sir epidemic model and the bond percolation theory , such that the set of individuals infected by a disease outbreak with transmissibility @xmath15 , has the same size as the giant connected cluster of occupied edges with occupation probability @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the mapping can be extended to multiplex networks and one can treat percolation on multiplex networks as an epidemic spreading process @xcite .",
    "each edge of type @xmath5 is occupied with probability @xmath8 , equal to the probability that the end node of that edge ( the neighbor of an infected node ) will become infected with disease @xmath5 . here",
    ", we consider the cooperation between two diseases .",
    "if a given node has at least one edge of each type , connecting the node to the infinite infected clusters , the transmissibility of these edges is enhanced .",
    "the probability that a node belongs to the giant co - infected cluster is equal to the probability that a given node has enhanced occupied edges of both types , connecting it to the giant connected cluster of enhanced occupied edges . hence , using percolation theory and the generation function method , we can solve exactly for the fraction of individuals , infected with both diseases in configuration model networks with arbitrary degree distributions .",
    "those nodes connected with the occupied overlapped edges can behave as a whole , since if one of them is infected by both diseases , all others will also be infected .",
    "hence we can merge theses nodes into a single node , a so - called supernode @xcite .",
    "in other words , the network is renormalized to a network with supernodes connected with only the non - overlapped edges .",
    "one can find the probability that a random node belongs to a supernode of size @xmath16 , denoted by @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "assuming that there is no correlation between the overlapped and non - overlapped edges in the original network , namely , @xmath18 , the size distribution of the supernodes is obtained for every arbitrary overlapping degree distribution @xmath19 , @xmath20^m\\big]_{x=1-t_{ab}}\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{eq101 } \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath21 is the generation function for the distribution of the overlapped degrees of nodes , reached by following a randomly chosen overlapped edge and is given by @xcite @xmath22    we define @xmath23 as the degree of supernodes which denotes the number of non - overlapped edges of each supernode . from renormalization theory ,",
    "the degree distribution of supernodes of size @xmath16 , @xmath24 is determined as the distribution of the sum of @xmath16 random variables chosen from the marginal ( non - overlapped ) degree distribution @xmath25 , which is the @xmath16th - order convolution of @xmath25 @xcite . to find the size of the giant co - infected cluster , for each type @xmath1 of edge we define @xmath26 to be the probability that the end node ( supernode ) of a randomly chosen edge of type @xmath5 is the root of an infinite sub - tree infected with disease @xmath5 .",
    "the subtree infected with disease @xmath5 , by definition means that the subtree s nodes have disease @xmath5 , but they can have the other disease or not .",
    "the probabilities @xmath27 and @xmath28 , are schematically shown in fig .",
    "these probabilities play the role of the order parameters of the phase transition associated with the emergence of the giant co - infected cluster .",

    "the probability that the end node ( supernode ) of a randomly chosen edge of type @xmath5 , has degree @xmath31 is @xmath32 .",
    "there are two possibilities : if the end node of the randomly chosen edge of type @xmath5 , has at least one edge of each type @xmath5 , which leads to an infected cluster with disease @xmath5 ( probability @xmath26 ) , the transmissibility of each edge is increased by a factor @xmath33 . the second line of eq .",

    "the particular case of @xmath76 , is the overlap area of the giant connected components of two layers with occupied edges of types @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the overlapped cluster include the viable cluster , since between each two nodes of the cluster , there is at least one path following each type of occupied edges , but the paths can pass through nodes outside of the cluster and then return to the cluster .",
    "the overlapped cluster , which corresponds to an infected cluster without cooperativity , emerges continuously . for @xmath77 , cooperation between two diseases",
    "occurs and diseases can infect a greater fraction of the nodes . with increasing values of @xmath33 , the size of the co - infected cluster becomes greater . also ,",
    "with increasing @xmath33 , the common terms in the derivation of the co - infected and viable clusters , make a higher contribution .",
    "hence co - infected clusters show hybrid transitions similar to those seen for the viable clusters .",
    "in this paper , we have introduced a coinfection model for two diseases spreading on multiplex networks with the edges overlapping .",
    "two diseases can propagate simultaneously on one multiplex network , such that both diseases can infect the same set of nodes .",
    "our model illustrates how the existence of one infectious disease can enhance the propagation of the other disease . using the generating function technique ,",
    "we have given an analytic solution for the size of the giant co - infected cluster , i.e. , the set of nodes infected with both diseases , for uncorrelated multiplexes with arbitrary degree distribution .",
    "we have shown that the cooperation of two diseases decreases the network s robustness against propagation of both diseases , such that the epidemic threshold is shifted to smaller values of the edge transmission probability or the mean degree of networks .",
    "our results show that for low cooperativity , the co - infected cluster emerges continuously .",
    "however , increasing the strength of cooperation , the type of phase transition changes to hybrid .",
    "hence a tricritical point appears in our coinfection model . we have compared the size of the giant co - infected cluster with the viable cluster for multiplex networks , considering edge overlapping . with increasing cooperativity , the co - infected cluster shows behavior similar to that of the viable cluster at the emergence point .",
    "the viable cluster is a subgraph of the co - infected cluster .",
