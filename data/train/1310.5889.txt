    "<S> we study nonlinear interferometry applied to a measurement of atomic spin and demonstrate a sensitivity that can not be achieved by any linear - optical measurement with the same experimental resources . </S>",
    "<S> we use alignment - to - orientation conversion , a nonlinear - optical technique from optical magnetometry , to perform a nondestructive measurement of the spin alignment of a cold @xmath0rb atomic ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> we observe state - of - the - art spin sensitivity in a single - pass measurement , in good agreement with covariance - matrix theory . taking the degree of measurement - induced spin squeezing as a figure of merit , we find that the nonlinear technique s experimental performance surpasses the theoretical performance of any linear - optical measurement on the same system , including optimization of probe strength and tuning . </S>",
    "<S> the results confirm the central prediction of nonlinear metrology , that superior scaling can lead to superior absolute sensitivity . </S>"
