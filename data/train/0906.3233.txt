    "the mean absolute magnitude of brightest cluster galaxies is @xmath0 with a dispersion of @xmath1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the distribution of bcg absolute magnitudes is well represented by a gaussian distribution ( e.g. @xcite ) , and the relative variation of luminosities yields @xmath2 @xcite show that the luminosity dispersion in the near infrared is even less . due to this small intrinsic dispersion bcgs",
    "are ideal tools for cosmological distance determination ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore their theoretical investigation offers the possibility to understand the properties and evolution of the cluster itself and its members .",
    "@xcite points out that there is a variety of possible accounts for the observed scatter in bcg apparent magnitudes , but all contributions but intrinsic dispersion ( i.e. scatter in absolute magnitude ) seem to remain small , in particular is there no systematic trend with redshift .",
    "at least the small total dispersion shows that any single dispersion contribution remains small .",
    "there are many kinds of suggestions trying to explain the observed small scatter in magnitudes of brightest cluster galaxies .",
    "one possibility is the existence of a common luminosity function all galaxies of a cluster ( including the brightest one ) are drawn from ( ) , either with or without further development .",
    "the alternative consists of a unique creation process , a `` standard mold '' , or a not yet discovered physical effect that delimits the luminosities of galaxies and cuts off the bright end of the luminosity function .",
    "this hypothesis is underpinned by the astonishing fact that brightest galaxies of rich clusters are just as luminous as the brightest observed field galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "how special are bcgs ? it has been argued that surface brightness profiles of bcgs are well fit by the same srsic law that describes less - luminous spheroids and obey the same relations between fitting parameters that characterise e / s0 galaxies generally ( @xcite ) . on the other hand , @xcite",
    "show that bcgs contain a larger fraction of dark matter as compared to non - bcgs of the same stellar mass , influenced by the cluster environment .",
    "x - ray observations of the intracluster medium ( e.g. , @xcite ) , in particular of the cluster core , has given rise to the assumption of cooling flows depositing up to 100 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 , building up the bcg over many gyrs .",
    "however , @xcite support the alternative that cores of cool gas are being built from the accretion of discrete stable subclusters . at the same time they realise that the common presence of substructure in galaxy clusters argues for accretion or merger events that occured sufficiently recently not to be erased by relaxation of the cluster ( @xcite ) .",
    "galactic cannibalism , i.e.  the accretion of the existing galaxy population through dynamical friction and tidal stripping predominantly in the evolved cluster , has been proposed by several authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "further investigations by merritt(@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and others ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) showed , however , that galaxies are moving too fast and are significantly tidally truncated thereby suppressing dynamical friction .",
    "they concluded that the dynamical friction timescales are generally too long such that galaxies could therefore only accrete a small fraction of their total luminosity within a hubble time .",
    "galactic mergers remain as the most likely dynamical effect that dominates bcg evolution . but given a vivid merger history , it is problematical how a uniform magnitude of the brightest cluster galaxy can get over frequent encounters while being exposed to mergers with other galaxies , or deletion .",
    "tightly related to this puzzle , the question comes up whether the common luminosity function of all up to date analysed clusters is a direct consequence of the initial mass fluctuations of the early universe  or otherwise , if the mass spectrum at that time was an entirely other one , and evolution processes provide for the universality of the luminosity function .",
    "however , the scenario seems less agitated .",
    "@xcite estimates , correlating spatial extension and luminosity of bcgs , that mergers of galaxies of comparable size lead to the formation of the first - ranked member . as he divides the collapse time of a cluster by the time that pass between two close encounters of two relatively big galaxies , he obtains about four merger events forming the bcg .",
    "this result coincides with the number of observed cores in cd - galaxies . in the same way",
    ", the luminosity function changed only little , because merger processes operate effectively only on large massive galaxies ( @xcite ) .    numerical simulations of large groups of 50 - 100 spherical galaxies in an equilibrium cluster have been done by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these simulations find a runaway merging process occuring near the cluster center forming a bcg .",
    "recent analyses of the millenium simulation ( @xcite ) by @xcite indicate that , on the one hand , the most massive elliptical galaxies have the oldest and most metal rich stellar populations . on the other hand , massive ellipticals",
    "are predicted to be assembled later than their lower mass counterparts , and they have a larger effective number of progenitor systems ( reaching up to @xmath5 ) .    in order to investigate the influence of galaxy mergers on the bcg mass dispersion systematically and with statistical significance , we set up ensembles of monte carlo simulations of cluster evolution .",
    "a set of parameters that describe the initial conditions of the cluster is defined , then the cluster evolution is simulated and the evolved cluster is characterized .",
    "after that , the simulation is repeated from the beginning with the same initial parameter set , evolving to a different cluster due to the somewhat stochastic nature of galaxy encounters .",
    "the number of simulations of cluster evolution for a fixed set of initial conditions defines the ensemble size , which in turn determines the level of confidence with which parameters of the evolved cluster can be specified .",
    "then one of the initial cluster parameters is varied leaving all other parameters fixed , and an ensemble of cluster simulations is run in the same way as described above .",
    "this parameter variation is repeated with a certain step size within an interval given by observations .",
    "the interval is supposed to cover all occurences in nature ( e.g. , the cluster richness ) and/or uncertainties as the true value could not yet be fixed by observations ( e.g. , the fraction of cluster mass that is still bound to individual galaxies , @xcite ) .",
    "having gone through all steps of the variation of this particular cluster parameter , the next parameter is varied leaving all others fixed . in this way",
    ", the full parameter space is covered , while all parameters are varied independently of each other .",
    "possible correlations of initial cluster parameters ( e.g. , size and richness ) can easily be applied afterwards by restricting the parameter space to a subspace .",
    "the required computing power for such a large number of repeated simulations of cluster evolution over a hubble time , covering a broad parameter space , is still beyond the capacities of present - day detailed n - body simulations .",
    "that is why a monte carlo code has been developed to investigate the small bcg mass dispersion , surpassing a purely analytical description ( e.g. , @xcite ) with the power of simulating statistically significant ensemble sizes .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in the next section the simulation method is described .",
    "section 3 details the parameter set and the mass dispersion .",
    "section 4 presents the results of three simulation sets with exemplarily representative parameter sets .",
    "a discussion of the results is given in section 5 . finally , section 6 briefs the conclusions of this work .",
    "numerical simulations require the masses of the galaxies . on the presumption of a given mass - to - light ratio @xmath6 , eq.([md2 ] ) is directly translatable into the bcg mass dispersion .",
    "though masses resulting from dynamical simulations are still dependent on @xmath6 once compared with the observed luminosities , the relative variation does not depend on @xmath6 .",
    "the following subsections briefly describe the model assumptions that enter the simulation computations . for further details",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the cluster simulation starts with @xmath7 galaxies homogeneously distributed in a sphere of radius @xmath8 and total mass @xmath9 . @xmath8 and @xmath9 are kept constant in time in the course of development ; in other words , we assume that the cluster is isolated and decoupled from the hubble flow . at the beginning",
    "the number of galaxies in the cluster equals @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath7 diminishes in the course of time due to mergers and destruction of galaxies .",
    "the mass of the destroyed galaxies is counted to the intergalactic medium , so that the total mass of the cluster remains constant .",
    "the galaxy masses are initially drawn from the exponential distribution function discussed in sect .",
    "[ massdispersion ] .",
    "the model starts from the assumption that the total mass of the galaxy cluster is proportional to the total mass of all galaxies :    @xmath11    here @xmath12 is the initial galaxy number and @xmath13 is the mean galaxy mass ( sect .",
    "[ massdispersion ] ) . then the constant @xmath14 is the ratio of cluster mass to galaxy mass , i.e. the ratio of mass - to - light ratio of the cluster ( in the following denoted by @xmath15 ) and mass - to - light ratio of the galaxies :    @xmath16    the total mass of a ( rich ) cluster is of the order of @xmath17",
    ". therefore the mass - to - light ratio of a cluster is within the range @xmath18\\ , \\upsilon_\\odot$ ] , and so the discrepancy between the mass - to - light ratios of present clusters as a whole and their individual members is at least @xmath19 and probably more .",
    "an interesting and crucial question concerning the interaction between galaxies of a cluster is how much of the cluster dark matter is really gravitationally bound within galaxies ( @xcite ) , i.e. the value of @xmath14 .",
    "two possible extreme cases are imaginable : either the dark matter hides within individual halos of single galaxies , or these halos are smeared over the whole intergalactic background due to tidal processes or similar effects .",
    "as virial velocities of the galaxies are determined by the total cluster mass , whereas individual galaxy masses enter decisively those equations that determine the interaction between two encountering galaxies , the trend resulting from the different extreme cases can be anticipated :    if dark matter exists in individual halos , the merger cross section is much larger than in a cluster containing significantly intergalactic matter , so the model develops more rapidly and more violently .",
    "this work considers these two cases .      in this paper",
    "individual galaxies are described by two parameters : their radius @xmath20 and their mass @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "mass and radius are changing in the course of cluster evolution ; at the beginning , the masses of cluster galaxies are characterized by a distribution function with characteristic mass @xmath13 and an associated distribution function in galaxy radii with characteristic radius @xmath23 .",
    "the evaluation of galaxy encounters is done under the assumption that galaxies are represented by plummer spheres :    @xmath24    here @xmath25 is the plummer radius , @xmath9 is the total mass of the galaxy and @xmath26 is the gravitational constant .",
    "later , for the energy transfer in the tidal approximation , the root mean square ( rms ) radius of the extended perturbed mass distribution is needed .",
    "so we further assume a cut - off radius @xmath27 . in the following",
    ", we call this proportional factor @xmath28 .",
    "the galaxy radii @xmath29 are related to the drawn masses via the faber - jackson - law . calculating interaction of cluster galaxies ,",
    "the significant parameter is not the radius but rather the binding energy which computes for a plummer model to :    @xmath30      encounters of galaxies let the model evolve . in this work ,",
    "encounters are described by the two parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath31 is the relative velocity , and the maximum impact parameter @xmath32 defines the maximum separation between two passing galaxies that is evaluated to be an encounter .",
    "fixing the total cluster mass @xmath33 and characteristic radius @xmath8 to be independent model parameters , the mean square of the spatial velocity @xmath34 is set by the virial theorem that is assumed to be applicable to the cluster :    @xmath35    this procedure is in contradistinction to the procedure of @xcite .",
    "they find a kind of `` explosive '' merging without the additional constraint of virial equilibrium .",
    "the radius @xmath8 of the sphere is assumed to be proportional to the gravitational radius with proportionality factor @xmath36 .",
    "in addition , we assume the spatial virial velocity @xmath37 ( that also determines the rate of encounters ) equals @xmath38 that has to be put into the formula of energy transfer .",
    "the impact parameter @xmath39 of the actual encounter is chosen within the limits of @xmath40 $ ] such that encounters are uniformly distributed upon the maximum encounter cross - section @xmath41 .    using the impulse approximation , in this model @xmath32",
    "is defined the way that the error due to neglecting encounters with impact parameters greater than @xmath32 is less than one per cent for a galaxy of standard size @xmath23 ( @xmath23 corresponds to @xmath13 via the faber - jackson - law ) .",
    "the mean time between two encounters is given by @xmath42 and diminishes with decreasing galaxy number @xmath7 during the cluster development .",
    "the total development time is set to @xmath43 .",
    "gravitational interaction is the origin of cluster development .",
    "we compare the kinetic energy from orbital motion of two encountering galaxies with their internal energies .",
    "the binding energy of an individual galaxy increases at the expense of the orbital energy , i.e. at the expense of the total kinetic energy of their relative motion .",
    "as long as the total energy transfer @xmath44 is less than the kinetic energy of the relative motion , the pair of galaxies is assumed to stay unbound .",
    "the energy input leads to an increase in binding energy of a galaxy which therefore expands .",
    "if energy input exceeds the binding energy of the concerning galaxy , this leads to its destruction .",
    "but if the total energy transfer is higher than their kinetic energy ,    @xmath45    the encounter ends up in a bound system , and it is assumed that the galaxies merge . if the encounter leads to a merger event , both participating galaxies are replaced by a single one ( the remnant ) , and its mass and radius has to be recalculated .",
    "the remnant mass is simply the sum of both galaxy masses , and the radius is computed from energy conservation :    @xmath46    it is possible that the remnant binding energy becomes @xmath47 , if    @xmath48    in this case no remnant is created and both galaxies break up .    to calculate energy exchange ,",
    "the energy transfer is expressed using the impulse and tidal approximation ( @xcite ) combined with a smooth interpolation of the two limiting cases of @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 is the median radius of the respective perturbed system ) .",
    "the energy transfer of a particle of mass @xmath53 passing an extended particle system at distance @xmath39 with velocity @xmath31 according to impulse and tidal approximation is    @xmath54    where @xmath20 is the rms - radius of the perturbed system @xmath55 ( @xcite ) .    in the case of central penetration ( @xmath49 )",
    "the energy transfer between two identical plummer models is given by    @xmath56    where @xmath57 was introduced in subsect .",
    "[ galaxies ] .",
    "the interpolation formula is then assumed to be    @xmath58    ( fig .",
    "[ interpolgraf ] ) .    proceeding this way we use two terms of energy transfer in high speed encounters , i.e. in encounters where relative velocities are higher than the galaxy internal velocity dispersion .",
    "this approximation is not too crude ( @xcite ) although galaxy relative velocities are about as high as their star velocities .",
    "other dynamical processes , especially dynamical friction between galaxies or galaxies and the intergalactic background , tidal interaction between galaxies and the cluster potential as well as mass - loss due to ram - pressure are neglected .",
    "trying to understand the bcg mass dispersion , it is necessary to know more about the stochastic variance , inherent in the distribution function . when drawing @xmath7 galaxies from a given frequency distribution , there is already a dispersion in the mass of a distinct , e.g. the brightest , galaxy depending on the kind of distribution and the number of drawn galaxies . an analytical approximation of the global luminosity distribution of galaxies in today s clusters is schechter s law ( @xcite ) :    @xmath59    with @xmath60.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath61 is given within an error of 20% , but there are also votes for an exponential distribution in compact clusters ( @xmath62 ) differing from that of field galaxies ( ) . in any case , solely the number of the brightest ( cd- ) galaxies in the centres of galaxy clusters are not exactly accounted for ( @xcite , and references therein )",
    "this fact by itself is an indication of the answer to the central question : is schechter s law the result of development in kind of merger and destruction processes or does it reflect the mass spectrum in the early universe ( @xcite ) ?",
    "since the bcg is in an exceptional position with respect to schechter s law and does not fit the global distribution , it is not probable that schechter s distribution accrues from a different distribution ( except that other than development processes would affect the bcg luminosity )",
    ". otherwise the distribution would include the bcg .    with the assumption of a specific mass - to - light ratio of individual galaxies",
    ", galaxy masses can be drawn from a universal mass distribution .",
    "because of better analytical handling and to avoid divergences galaxy masses of the model cluster are drawn from an exponential distribution . in this case , the initial probability distribution is    @xmath63    shown in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] .    in this case",
    "the expected value of the most massive initial galaxy can be written as an harmonic sum that depends on the mass @xmath13 characterizing the distribution function and on the number of drawn galaxies @xmath12 :    @xmath64    the bcg mass dispersion is then computed to @xmath65    with @xmath66 , e.g. , the relative deviation computes to @xmath67 .",
    "though the expected value of the bcg masses increases with galaxy number , the relative deviation does not .",
    "generally the fact is remarkable , that initially bcg masses depend on the number of galaxies , whereas in reality such a dependence is not found , and the bcg relative mass dispersion is distinctly smaller for all numbers of galaxies than the observed one .",
    "these differences may be due to development processes , although additional correlations among @xmath8 and @xmath7 may cause selection effects in @xmath68-space .",
    "statistical statements about clusters of galaxies are derived from model assumptions depending on several parameters .",
    "thus the resulting quantities to be analysed are only estimates of the mean sampled over infinite runs .",
    "the accuracy , given as relative 1@xmath69 variance , is proportional to the square root of the number of simulation runs .",
    "differently set up model clusters with the same set of initial parameters are here called an ensemble . so since all our simulation results are based on ensemble sizes of 100 runs , they are accurate to within 10% .    additionally , any dispersion in absolute magnitudes ( or masses , respectively ) in a model that depends on variable parameters will generally depend on these parameters , too .",
    "for example , bcg masses  as well as their dispersions  that are drawn from a distribution function depend on a characteristic mass @xmath13 scaling this function and depend also on the total number of galaxies @xmath12 drawn from this distribution .",
    "figures [ f1 ] and [ f2 ] illustrate the dependence of the mean of bcg masses on the initial number of galaxies . likewise , standard deviations belonging to any value of @xmath7 are shown , too .",
    "figure [ f1 ] describes the initial state , fig .",
    "[ f2 ] the evolved state . the curve in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] is smooth , because the expected value of bcg mass and dispersion are theoretically computable . in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] the stochastic 10% noise of the mean values is obvious .    in order to calculate the total dispersion of bcg masses ,",
    "let these masses be a function of a vector @xmath70 in parameter space .",
    "furthermore , assume that a distribution function @xmath71 is given .",
    "the expected value of @xmath9 then averages the ensemble and the parameter space to    @xmath72    where @xmath73 means an ensemble average .",
    "the mass dispersion averages the ensemble and the parameter space to    @xmath74    where the inner brackets always denote an ensemble average .",
    "thus , the total dispersion is the expected value of the individual dispersion in @xmath70 plus the scatter of the expected values of @xmath9 in @xmath70 :    @xmath75    this expression is used later on to calculate the mass dispersion of the simulations . at the beginning of the dynamical development , any scatter in bcg absolute magnitudes or masses is the sum of different kinds of model dispersion :    1 .   the statistical variation at constant model parameters within an ensemble , whereby one gets a convolution of two distributions : the stochastic variance at a constant vector of model parameters and 2 .",
    "the variance caused by the distribution of clusters upon the model parameters .",
    "hence the observed relative mass dispersion is the upper limit of the statistical error .    in this context",
    "it is astonishing that there is definitely no correlation between @xmath76 and richness ( meaning the final galaxy number ) in today s observed clusters ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . but drawing galaxies from a distinct distribution ( except from a @xmath77-function ) , there is always  within the bounds of resolution  such a dependence , so that there inevitably has to be another process to explain the independence of @xmath76 on @xmath7 .",
    "the simulations try to answer the question whether mergers can account for such a behaviour .",
    "the observed scatter in absolute magnitudes is in any case an upper limit of the intrinsic bcg mass dispersion within any ensemble .",
    "the dependence of the bcg absolute magnitudes on the scaling mass @xmath13 is more complicated .",
    "@xmath13 is positively correlated with @xmath76 with high statistical significance . in order to eliminate any photometric calibration error as well as a global shift of the luminosity function , @xcite compare @xmath78 ( @xmath79 is the magnitude of the 10th brightest galaxy ) with @xmath80 .",
    "they find , that both differences are negatively correlated .",

    "[ abb2 ] the shift of the maximum toward smaller galaxy numbers but significantly greater cluster radii is striking .    figure [ abb24 ] makes it clear that the relative mass dispersion remains always below forty per cent and even decreases significantly going to greater galaxy numbers , particularly at this set of parameters .",
    "[ abb26 ] shows that the number of mergers leading to the formation of the bcg is non - zero for a wider range of parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the maximum mean number of mergers is four as in sect .",
    "[ simi ] .    at smaller galaxy numbers",
    "the percentage of those galaxies that have been involved in merger processes increases up to sixty per cent ( fig .  [ abb28 ] ) , cf . also fig .",
    "[ abb8 ] . from a galaxy number of about four hundred onwards",
    "there are practically no merger events to be noted .",
    ", now for model [ simiii].,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "there are two processes with opposite effects which rule the evolution of the model : on the one hand the number of encounters decreases with increasing cluster radius at fixed galaxy number ( cf .",
    "[ abb9 ] ) . on the other hand the virial velocity increases with increasing total cluster mass by increasing richness at fixed cluster radius .",
    "although the number of encounters rises with velocity , the equations of energy transfer ( eqs .",
    "[ spitzer1 ] and [ spitzer2 ] ) depend on @xmath113 , and the kinetic energy term of the relative motion depends on @xmath114 .",
    "so high energy transfers are only effective for mergers at low velocities . taking both effects together ,",
    "only compact groups evolve noticeably in contrast to clusters .",
    "the number of encounters @xmath115 of a single galaxy for the total development time can be estimated to    @xmath116    if richness does not change dramatically .",
    "the merger probability can be estimated in the same way : let @xmath117 be the impact parameter so that the merger criterion is fulfilled within its enclosed area :    @xmath118    then the fraction of merger events ( caused by the stochastic choice of impact parameters ) is @xmath119 .",
    "this fraction multiplied by the number of encounters then reveals the number of merger events @xmath120 of one galaxy ( e.g. the bcg ) :    @xmath121    so the number @xmath104 of mergers depends strongly on the cluster radius and decreases with increasing @xmath8 ( cf .",
    "[ abb7 ] ) . on the other hand",
    "@xmath104 increases proportional to the square root of the initial number of galaxies ( assumed that it remains nearly constant , e.g. fig .",
    "[ abb7 ] at @xmath122 mpc and higher )",
    ". the boost of constructive ( remnant forming ) or destructive encounters can thus be explained , but not the merger boost at low galaxy numbers .",
    "furthermore it has to be taken into account whether the remnant remains bound .",
    "that leads to    @xmath123    the remnant has a chance to survive only at high cluster radii and small galaxy numbers . together with the merger criterion this leads to the occurring maximum development at small cluster radii and small numbers of galaxies ( figs .",
    "[ abb3 ] , [ abb6 ] , [ abb8 ] ) : small radii are necessary to form remnants , and their binding energies are negative only at small galaxy numbers .",
    "these estimates expressed in simple formulae ( eqs .",
    "[ simple1]-[simple3 ] ) are possible because our simulation show that there is no agravating change of the initial mass distribution .    the simulation computations of sect .",
    "[ simiii ] show a merger behaviour of all galaxies and especially of those forming the bcg comparable to sect .  [ simi ] .",
    "a higher galaxy mass has a positive effect on the number of mergers because the mean energy transfer rises with the third power of the characteristic mass , whereas the kinetic energy of the relative motion still rises linearly . on the other side a higher cluster mass in sect .",
    "[ simiii ] in contrast to sect .",
    "[ simi ] causes the virial velocity to increase , suppressing energy transfer such as in sect .",
    "[ simii ] .    interpreting simulation [ simii ] to represent cluster states further evolved in time compared with simulation [ simi ] as the mass of the intergalactic medium increases due to tidal stripping ( @xcite ) , a picture of cluster evolution",
    "is formed : in the early phases of cluster evolution merger processes dominate the development of mass spectrum and bcg , then paling into insignificance as time goes by ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . comparing both simulations it should be noted that the cluster mass is the same in simulation [ simii ] at @xmath124 and simulation [ simi ] at @xmath66 .",
    "an increase of the mass fraction of intergalactic matter leads to a drastic decrease in the merger rate at equal galaxy mass distributions , because the mean kinetic energy controlled by the virial theorem ( eq .",
    "[ glvii ] ) outgrows the expected energy transfers in eq .  [ interpol ] , so that mergers become improbable .",
    "the amount of galaxy binding energy is not influenced by a variation of @xmath14 , and so a ( less steep ) decrease in galaxy destructions is expected on the basis of eq .",
    "[ interpol ] as shown by the simulations .    a closer consideration of fig .  [ abb3 ]",
    "together with fig .",
    "[ abb6 ] , dividing the mean increase of bcg mass by the mean number of mergers leading to the bcg formation , shows that the brightest galaxy must have been built by mergers of galaxies of uniform mass @xmath13 independent of general conditions of the cluster .",
    "this is in accordance with the observation results of @xcite .",
    "figure [ abb8 ] gives information about the number of constructive mergers per final galaxy number , i.e. the fraction of galaxies that merged with other galaxies during the simulation .",
    "this percentage is equivalent to the averaged number of mergers a galaxy has undergone",
    ". this fraction rises going from high to small cluster radii and amounts to between some and about hundred per cent .",
    "toomre ( @xcite ) speculated that perhaps all elliptical cluster galaxies have been built by mergers . from the fraction of galaxies that are presently involved in gravitational interactions and the probable life time of this passing phenomena he calculated that merging of spiral galaxies happens for a fraction of about ten per cent of all cluster galaxies , in good agreement with the results of this work",
    "the fact that especially rich compact clusters which are assumed to be dynamical older systems than spiral rich ones have a significantly larger fraction of elliptical galaxies ( up to 35 per cent in the coma cluster ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) ) may have multiple reasons .",
    "first a comparison of the simulations in sects .",
    "[ simi ] and [ simii ] shows that mergers grind to a halt at rising fraction of intergalactic matter , as the fraction of prospective interacting galaxies decreases at constant total cluster mass due to mergers and destructions .",
    "hence the merger rate is higher in a cluster of earlier state of development ( corresponding to irregular spiral rich clusters ) than in the final state of compact clusters .",
    "so the fraction of elliptical galaxies in toomre s estimation has to be corrected upwards .",
    "secondly elliptical galaxies may be a result of disturbances caused by nearby passages without merging that would lead to its rise to the presently observed value .    the percentage of galaxies destroyed in encounters ( fig .  [ abb10 ] ) yields an estimate of the dark matter fraction in clusters provided by destroyed galaxies .",
    "this fraction amounts up to 60 per cent corresponding to a ratio of cluster mass and total galaxy mass of @xmath125",
    ".    further simulations with the presented model were carried out using other sets of parameters without leading to different results than discussed in this work .",
    "particularly an increase in galaxy numbers beyond a value of 1000 does not change anything , because the evolution of any model with scales comparable to clusters takes an imperceptible course at high galaxy numbers .",
    "there is a common result from all simulations of sect .  [ results ] : the cluster evolution is tightly related to the evolution of the brightest galaxy of this cluster . only at small galaxy numbers and simultaneously at small cluster radii the dynamical development due to the model described in sect.[model ] plays a noticeable role ( cf .",
    "e.g. fig .  [ abb6 ] ) . at the same time",
    "increasing merger action is a concomitant of increasing destruction of galaxies .",
    "so , in the parameter range of rapid evolution , the number of galaxies depleted such that the evolved small cluster looks like a compact group rather than an abell cluster .",
    "nevertheless merging is always the dominant process ( at least for the most massive galaxies ) . for clusters of presently observed richness and their most luminous member ( being the comparative value to our simulation ) the dynamical development of the mass spectrum and of correlated quantities as the bcg mass causes only little changes with respect to the initial conditions .    considering fig .",
    "[ abb2 ] and fig .",
    "[ abb4 ] the steadiness of bcg masses and their ensemble dispersion attract attention ( irrespective of compact groups ) .",
    "this approximate independence of masses on cluster radius is observed in reality , and there are two causes that balance each other : at the beginning of the simulation the bcg masses are small and rise with increasing richness . in the course of evolution mergers take place preferentially at low galaxy numbers resulting in a relatively constant bcg mass level after the development in dependence of the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath7 . taking into account an additional correlation between cluster radius and richness ( e.g. @xcite ) the bcg mass steadiness would turn out almost clearer , just as their dispersion would be narrower than stated in this work because of the restriction in parameter space .",
    "why does the bcg mass scatter remain significantly narrow even at the end of cluster development ?",
    "first of all the number of mergers is relatively small for the mentioned reasons ( between one and six merger events depending on the parameter set ) , and secondly the identity of a galaxy to be bcg is fixed only when the cluster development is complete .",
    "so , not the mass dispersion of a distinct galaxy fixed before the starting development is investigated , but the mass dispersion of a galaxy that is a posteriori identified to be the most massive one . therefore the bcg mass dispersion turns out to be smaller than in the case of any individual galaxy chosen at the beginning of the simulation and following its evolution ."
