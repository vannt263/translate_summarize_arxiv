    "nuclear double @xmath5-decay with two neutrinos is a rare and exotic process occurring in nuclei with long lifetimes .",
    "since goeppert - mayer predicted that there is double @xmath5-decays in 1935 @xcite , many researches have been carried out on double @xmath6-decay with two neutrinos or without neutrinos @xcite .",
    "plenty of results can be found in the references of the articles @xcite .",
    "although much experimental effort has been devoted to double @xmath6-decay , only the half - lives of eleven nuclei with double @xmath0-decays were obtained and the half - life of a single nucleus with double electron capture ( ecec ) was measured due to the difficulty of experimental detection in this field @xcite . on double @xmath1 decay ( @xmath7 ) , experimental data of definite half - lives are still not available @xcite .",
    "theoretically there are many successful calculations on the double @xmath0-decay half - lives @xcite .",
    "however , calculations on the double @xmath1-decay half - lives are much less as they are compared with those on double @xmath0-decay @xcite .",
    "haxton et al .",
    "estimated the half - lives of six nuclei from mass number a=78 ( @xmath8 ) to mass number a=136 ( @xmath9 ) and showed that their half - lives for double @xmath1-decay ranged approximately from @xmath10 years to @xmath11 years @xcite . since the calculations from haxton et al .",
    "@xcite , thirty years have passed and the data of nuclear masses have been updated significantly @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to calculate the half - lives of double @xmath12-decay with new nuclear mass tables because the half - lives are very sensitive to the decay energies .",
    "recently , suhonen made the theoretical investigation of double @xmath1-decay for two nuclei , @xmath8 @xcite and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "as definite double @xmath1-decay half - lives are not available in experiments now , it is interesting to make a complete calculation on the possible candidates of double @xmath1-decay and to predict new candidates for future experiments .",
    "based on the 2012 nuclear mass table @xcite , we calculate the decay energy of all possible double @xmath1-decay emitters and pay special attention to the parent nuclei where they are denoted with a symbol ( @xmath14 ) in the table .",
    "the number of possible double @xmath1-decay emitters is 40 in the mass table @xcite and their mass number ranges from a=36 ( @xmath15 ) to a=252 ( @xmath16 ) @xcite . in accordance with textbooks and published articles ,",
    "the decay energy of double @xmath3-decay is defined as @xmath17\\,c^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where m(a , z ) is the mass excess of the parent nucleus and m(a , z-2 ) is the mass excess of the daughter nucleus .",
    "@xmath18 is the rest mass of an electron ( or a positron ) and @xmath19 is the speed of light in vacuum ( @xmath20 in natural units ) .",
    "our numerical calculations for the 40 possible emitters shows that many of them have negative decay energy to double @xmath1-decay or have approximately zero decay energy .",
    "only eight of them have significantly positive energies for double @xmath1-decay .",
    "we list the eight emitters ( parent nuclei ) and their daughter nuclei in table 1 , together with the decay energy and the isotopic abundance ( is ) of parent nuclei ( or their @xmath21-decay half - lives ( @xmath22 ) when @xmath23-decay is observed ) .",

    "in summary , we collect the experimental data of possible double @xmath1-decay nuclei based on the 2012 nuclear mass table and find that eight nuclei have significantly positive decay energies . a systematic calculation of double @xmath1-decay half - lives for the eight nuclei",
    "is carried out with the analytical formula being a natural generalization of the systematic law from double @xmath29-decay to double @xmath1-decay .",
