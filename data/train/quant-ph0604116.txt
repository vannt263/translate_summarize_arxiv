    "it is not a trivial problem how to describe the dissipative and irreversible dynamics of quantum systems , since the schrdinger equation applies to closed systems and describes unitary evolutions . in the standard approach to this issue ,",
    "one puts the system in a large reservoir to allow energy exchange and dissipation .",
    "then , one applies the schrdinger equation to the total ( closed ) system , system s+reservoir b , and extracts the dynamics of system s by tracing out the reservoir degrees of freedom , @xmath0 which exhibits a non - unitary evolution and is described by a master equation .",
    "here , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the density operators of the total system and system s , respectively .",
    "one of the targets of this article is to discuss a hypothesis that is taken for granted in most of such approaches : factorized ( uncorrelated ) initial conditions @xmath3 are usually assumed in the derivation of master equations without any reasoning about the validity and the necessity of this hypothesis @xcite .",
    "we will discuss in the following a derivation of master equations for generic ( correlated ) initial states .",

    "we define two projection operators : @xmath4 defined by ( [ eqn : p ] ) and @xmath18 they are projection operators since they satisfy @xmath19 assuming the normalization of the reference state @xmath20 .",
    "one of the main issues of the present article is to discuss the choice of the reference state @xmath6 .",
    "we do not know at this moment which state should be taken as the reference state @xmath6 .",

    "let us now start the derivation of the master equation for @xmath2 defined by ( [ eqn : partialtrace ] ) .",
    "consider the initial - value problem for the total system , @xmath24 where the initial density operator @xmath25 is _ not _ assumed to be factorized like ( [ eqn : factorizedinitialstate ] ) . by projecting the liouville equation ( [ eqn : a1 ] ) onto the two subspaces defined by @xmath4 and @xmath26 , and noting the properties ( [ eqn : projliouv ] ) and ( [ eqn : plp ] ) , one gets    [ eqn : a3 ] @xmath27    respectively , where @xmath28 by formally integrating out the second equation and plugging the result into the first , one gets the following equation for the @xmath4-projected operator in the interaction picture @xcite , @xmath29 this is an _",
    "exact _ and _ non - markovian _",
    "master equation since the first term on the right - hand side contains a memory integral .",
    "the last term , on the other hand , represents the contribution arising from a possible initial correlation between system s and reservoir b. in fact , this term is absent when the initial state @xmath25 is factorized like ( [ eqn : factorizedinitialstate ] ) and the reference state of the projector is accordingly chosen as @xmath30 .",
    "we are interested in the fate of this inhomogeneous term in the following arguments , when there is an initial correlation between system s and reservoir b.",
    "let us make the markovian approximation here , since the exact master equation ( [ eqn : nonmarkovme ] ) is usually too complicated to handle for general systems and the markovian approximation is valid for various practical situations . in this article",

    "this rescaling in time eliminates the memory , and the system exhibits a markovian dynamics in the scaled time @xmath34 .    now consider the density operator @xmath35 that satisfies , for any nonvanishing @xmath11 , @xmath36 with the initial condition @xmath37 by integrating ( [ eqn : a6 ] ) , one gets @xmath38 which is arranged into the form @xcite @xmath39 where    @xmath40\\\\ \\mathcal{i}^{(\\lambda)}(\\tau ) & = \\lambda\\sum_m\\mathcal{p}\\tilde{q}_m\\mathcal{l}_\\mathrm{sb } \\mathcal{r}_m^{(\\lambda)}(\\tau)\\mathcal{q}\\rho_0 .",
    "\\label{eqn : correlationterm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the important feature is that the kernel @xmath41 and the contribution of the initial correlation @xmath42 are both governed by the operator @xmath43 therefore , the van hove limit of this key operator @xmath44 completes the van hove limit of the master equation ( [ eqn : reduceddynamics ] ) .",
    "as we will see later , the van hove limit of @xmath44 results in @xmath45 and it immediately leads us to the conclusion that , in van hove s limit , the memory kernel @xmath41 in ( [ eqn : memory ] ) is reduced to a markovian generator @xmath46 while the correlation term @xmath42 in ( [ eqn : correlationterm ] ) disappears @xmath47 so that the reduced dynamics ( [ eqn : reduceddynamics ] ) becomes @xmath48 the master equation in van hove s limit reads therefore    [ eqn : me ] @xmath49 with the initial condition @xmath50    that is , even if the initial state @xmath25 is not in a factorized form , but rather there is entanglement , or simply a classical correlation , between system s and reservoir b , all correlations disappear in van hove s limit and system s behaves as if the total system started from the factorized initial state ( [ eqn : diffeq ] ) with a reservoir state @xmath51 specified below .",
    "the key formula ( [ eqn : keyformula ] ) , and therefore the master equation ( [ eqn : me ] ) in van hove s limit , are proved under the following assumptions :    1 .",
    "the initial ( correlated ) state of the total system , @xmath25 , belongs to a single sector .",
    "that is , @xmath25 is given in the form @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the state which specifies the sector and @xmath54 s are bounded operators ; 2 .",
    "the state @xmath6 is mixing , and therefore the reservoir liouvillian @xmath55 bears a simple eigenvalue @xmath56 .",
    "we assume in addition that the remaining part of the spectrum of @xmath55 is absolutely continuous ; 3 .",
    "the projection operator @xmath4 adopted in ( [ eqn : keyformula ] ) and ( [ eqn : me ] ) must be defined in terms of @xmath51 that is mixing and `` contained '' in the initial state @xmath25 of the form ( [ eqn : condinitialstate ] ) .",
    "the state @xmath6 is called mixing with respect to the reservoir dynamics @xmath57 iff @xmath58 for any bounded superoperators @xmath59 and @xmath60 of the reservoir b , where @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "one of the typical mixing states is the thermal equilibrium state of bosons at finite temperature @xmath62 @xcite , which often appears in the literature . among other interesting mixing states ,",
    "there are nonequilibrium steady states , where system b consists of two reservoirs with different temperatures and steady current flows between them .",
    "such a situation is also within our scope .",
    "note here that a state @xmath25 that refers [ in the sense of ( [ eqn : condinitialstate ] ) ] to two ( or more ) different mixing states of an infinite reservoir can not be a physical state , since it is the superposition of states belonging to different inequivalent sectors .",
    "( imagine , for example , the superposition of states with different temperatures . )",
    "hypothesis ( i ) is therefore reasonable from this point of view .",
    "the important consequence of mixing is that it implies the existence of the point spectrum @xmath56 of @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "let us consider the time evolution , driven by the reservoir free liouvillian @xmath55 , of the expectation value of any operator @xmath63 , starting from the initial state @xmath25 of the kind ( [ eqn : condinitialstate ] ) , where @xmath64 s are operators of system s and @xmath65 s bounded operators of reservoir b. then , the mixing property ( [ eqn : mixingb ] ) of @xmath51 yields @xmath66\\displaybreak[0]\\\\ \\xrightarrow{t\\to\\infty } \\sum_i\\sum_j{\\mathop{\\mathrm{tr}}\\nolimits}_\\mathrm{b}\\{x_j\\omega_\\mathrm{b}\\}{\\mathop{\\mathrm{tr}}\\nolimits}\\ { a_jl_i(1_\\mathrm{s}\\otimes\\omega_\\mathrm{b})l_i^\\dag \\ } = { \\mathop{\\mathrm{tr}}\\nolimits}[d({\\mathop{\\mathrm{tr}}\\nolimits}_\\mathrm{b}\\{\\rho\\}\\otimes\\omega_\\mathrm{b } ) ] , \\label{eqn : diagonalprojectionb}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] and in this sense , we have @xmath67 for any state @xmath25 belonging to the sector of @xmath68 .",
    "this shows that @xmath55 bears one and the only simple eigenvalue ( in the relevant sector ) , which is @xmath56 .",
    "it is essential to note that , if @xmath55 admits more simple eigenvalues , such as for an ergodic state @xmath6 @xcite , it is not possible to derive a master equation as we will see later .",
    "recall further that mixing does not exclude a singular continuous spectrum , as far as it is transient , i.e. , riemann ",
    "lebesgue s lemma holds @xcite . hypothesis ( ii )",
    "therefore assumes stronger conditions than mixing .",
    "finally , eq .  ( [ eqn : bathrelaxation ] ) also shows that the eigenprojection @xmath69 belonging to the simple eigenvalue @xmath56 , @xmath70 acts on the state @xmath71 in the relevant sector as @xmath72 the projector @xmath4 suggested in hypothesis ( iii ) is nothing but this eigenprojection @xmath69 : the proper choice of the projector is @xmath73 where the reference state @xmath6 should be endowed with the mixing property and contained in the initial state as ( [ eqn : condinitialstate ] ) .",
    "a wrong projector yields secular terms and prevents us from deriving a master equation , as we will see in the next section .",
    "let us finally prove the key formula ( [ eqn : keyformula ] ) with the projector ( [ eqn : properp ] ) .",
    "it requires a few steps , since the spectral property of @xmath74 given in ( [ eqn : clp0 ] ) is not known .",
    "we start by noting that @xmath75 and hence @xmath76 .",
    "one therefore obtains @xmath77 in van hove s limit , irrespective of the spectrum of @xmath74 .",
    "second , the convolution @xmath78 is bounded for any @xmath79 , _ provided the projector is properly chosen as @xmath80 and the point spectrum of @xmath81 is removed by the projection @xmath82_. see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "now , by using @xmath83 we expand the relevant quantity ( [ eqn : key ] ) as @xmath84 let us split the first term into two contributions , the discrete and the continuous spectra of @xmath81 , by the projection operators @xmath69 and @xmath85 . for @xmath86 ,",
    "one gets @xmath87 which shows that the only possible divergence of the relevant operator in ( [ eqn : key ] ) in van hove s limit @xmath31 _ comes from the point spectrum of @xmath81 _ ( i.e.  the first term of the last expression ) . _",
    "if @xmath80 , however , the divergent term disappears due to @xmath88 : the contributions of the point spectrum are properly removed by @xmath82 . _",
    "the correct projection operator @xmath80 allows us to arrange the second term in ( [ eqn : expansion ] ) into @xmath89\\\\ = \\lambda\\frac{\\mathcal{q}}{\\mathcal{l}_0+i\\omega_m-0^+ } { e}^{i\\omega_m\\tau/\\lambda^2 } { \\int}_0^{\\tau/\\lambda^2}{d}t\\ , { e}^{\\mathcal{l}_0(\\tau/\\lambda^2-t)}\\mathcal{q } \\mathcal{l}_\\mathrm{sb}\\mathcal{q}{e}^{\\mathcal{l}_0't}\\\\ { } -\\lambda\\frac{\\mathcal{q}}{\\mathcal{l}_0+i\\omega_m-0^+ } \\mathcal{l}_\\mathrm{sb}{\\int}_0^{\\tau/\\lambda^2}{d}t\\,\\mathcal{q } { e}^{(\\mathcal{l}_0'+i\\omega_m)t } , \\label{eqn : higherterm}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] and we arrive at the recurrence formula @xmath90\\\\ & { } + \\lambda\\frac{\\mathcal{q}}{\\mathcal{l}_0+i\\omega_m-0^+ } { e}^{i\\omega_m\\tau/\\lambda^2 } { \\int}_0^{\\tau/\\lambda^2}{d}t\\ , { e}^{\\mathcal{l}_0(\\tau/\\lambda^2-t)}\\mathcal{q } \\mathcal{l}_\\mathrm{sb}\\mathcal{q}{e}^{\\mathcal{l}_0't}\\nonumber\\\\ & { } -\\lambda\\frac{\\mathcal{q}}{\\mathcal{l}_0+i\\omega_m-0^+ } \\mathcal{l}_\\mathrm{sb}\\mathcal{r}_m^{(\\lambda)}(\\tau)\\quad ( \\tau>0 ) .",
    "\\label{eqn : recurrence}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the integral in the second term is the convolution ( [ eqn : convolution ] ) , which is bounded for @xmath91 since the point spectrum of @xmath81 is removed by the projection @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , by iterating the expansion ( [ eqn : recurrence ] ) twice and by noting @xmath92 together with ( [ eqn : highest ] ) , we derive the key formula ( [ eqn : keyformula ] ) .    in summary ,",
    "the correct projector @xmath80 helps us to manage the subtle point spectrum @xmath56 of @xmath93 . with a wrong projector",
    ", we would fail to appropriately remove it , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : keyformula ] ) would not hold anymore , and @xmath44 would diverge in van hove s limit .",
    "this is because the wrong operator projects the reservoir onto a wrong state , so that the system evolution is frustrated , and develops secular terms in @xmath94 [ like in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : contpointspec ] ) ] .    as stressed in sec .  6",
    ", the reference state of the reservoir must be mixing in order that no discrete eigenvalue different from @xmath56 exists .",
    "otherwise , the point spectrum ( except @xmath56 ) is out of control , since we do not know the eigenprojections other than @xmath69 , and again the emergence of secular terms is inevitable .",
    "moreover , it should be noticed that the mixing property of the reservoir is crucial even for a _",
    "factorized _ initial state like ( [ eqn : factorizedinitialstate ] ) .",
    "in this article , we described the derivation of master equations via nakajima  zwanzig s projection operator method in the presence of the initial correlations with a reservoir . in van hove",
    "s limit , the initial correlation disappears and the total system behaves as if it started from a factorized initial condition .",
    "it was demonstrated that ( even for a factorized initial condition ) the choice of the projection operator is crucial and a wrong projection provokes secular terms .",
    "the mixing property of the reservoir is essential to the derivation of master equations .",
    "the factorization of the initial state in van hove s limit implies that the total system is _ factorized at any moment _ in the scaled time @xmath34 , since the `` initial time '' @xmath95 has no particular status .",
    "it is actually possible to prove it , i.e.  @xcite @xmath96 it is worth noting that the interaction between system s and reservoir b is not essential to the factorization : _ free evolution eliminates the correlation , and the reservoir relaxes into the mixing state @xmath51_. indeed , for any state @xmath25 of the total system of the type ( [ eqn : condinitialstate ] ) with a mixing state @xmath6 , we have @xmath97 where the contribution of the continuous spectrum decays out due to the mixing property .",
    "[ see eq .",
    "( [ eqn : bathrelaxation ] ) . ] in the rescaled time @xmath34 , the factorization is very rapid ( order @xmath98 in the scaled time @xmath34 ) , and the total system looks factorized at any moment .",
    "the timescales of the factorization and the mixing are related not only to the spread of the initial correlation and the perturbation from the mixing state but also to the size of the relevant reservoir observables .",
