    "quasars are particularly useful because their high intrinsic ultraviolet luminosities can be used as a background light source to be absorbed by intervening gas .",
    "studies of quasars out to redshifts of @xmath6 have put the strongest constraints yet on when the universe was reionized ( fan et al .",
    "the absence of gunn - petersen troughs along most lines of sight at @xmath7 shows that cosmic reionization was just about complete by @xmath8 .",
    "the high electron scattering optical depth of microwave background photons shows that the first phase of reionization occurred significantly earlier than @xmath8 ( dunkley et al .",
    "the reionization history at @xmath5 is still quite uncertain .",

    "it is now widely believed that the high luminosities of quasars are generated via gravitational potential energy released as matter falls towards supermassive black holes .",
    "reverberation mapping has shown the existence of a relationship between broad emission line velocity , luminosity and black hole mass which allows black hole masses to be estimated for all quasars ( kaspi et al .",

    "the canada - france high-@xmath1 quasar survey ( cfhqs ) is a survey based on multi - color optical imaging at the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) to discover quasars at redshifts @xmath10 much less luminous than those discovered by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "the cfhqs quasars are 10 to 75 times less luminous than the main sdss sample ( fan et al .",

    "the range in luminosity is essential for an accurate determination of the quasar luminosity function and for studying lower mass black holes than those powering sdss quasars .",

    "the six quasars whose discovery we present in this paper were found from several different optical imaging surveys which all form part of the cfhqs .",
    "the cfhqs uses several datasets with different magnitude limits to sample a range of quasar luminosities . because ultracool brown dwarfs are also found from this type of optical imaging , the cfhqs shares imaging data with the canada - france brown dwarf survey ( cfbds ) .",

    "it is important to note that cfhqs / cfbds followup is still ongoing and there are likely many more quasars to be found in this survey over the next couple of years .",
    "for this reason , we defer discussion of the @xmath8 quasar luminosity function to a future publication when there will be some areas of the cfhqs with well defined selection criteria and completeness .",

    "partially , this is due to its high redshift . the simulations of quasar colors as a function of redshift from willott et al .",

    "although the emission line is very narrow by quasar standards , a fit to the red side of ly@xmath34  suggests an intrinsic symmetric gaussian would have fwhm@xmath48 and in addition there is a residual broader component .",
    "these velocities are too great to be caused by normal galactic processes and indicate an active nucleus .",
    "note that if cfhqsj0216 - 0455 is accreting at the eddington limit , then its low absolute magnitude implies a black hole mass of @xmath49 .",
    "therefore it is not too surprising to find a relatively narrow emission line in this quasar .",
    "however , near - ir spectroscopy of the mgii  line will be required to derive a virial black hole mass .",
