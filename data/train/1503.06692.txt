    "people making a decision in a ballot are expected to follow a rational behavior .",
    "rational arguments based on utility functions ( payoff ) have been considered in the literature regarding vote modeling  @xcite .",
    "the rational hypothesis , however , tends to consider the individuals as isolated entities .",
    "this might actually be the reason why it fails to account for relatively high turnout rates in elections  @xcite .",
    "the presence of a social context increases the incentive for a voter to actually vote , as he or she can influence several other individuals towards the same option  @xcite .",
    "this effect is not only restricted to turnout , but also applies to the choices expressed in the election  @xcite .",
    "it is easy to find examples of people showing their electoral preferences in public in the hope of influencing their peers .",
    "still social influence can also act in more subtle ways , without the explicit intention of the involved agents to influence each other .",
    "the collective dynamics of social groups notably differs from the one observed from simply aggregating independent individuals  @xcite .",
    "social influence is thus an important ingredient for modeling opinion dynamics , but it requires as well the inclusion of a social context for the individuals  @xcite .    even though nowadays the pervasive presence of new information technologies has the potential to change the relation between distance and social contacts , we assume that daily mobility still determines social exchanges to a large extent .",
    "human mobility has been studied in recent years with relatively indirect techniques such as tracking bank notes  @xcite or with more direct methods such as tracking cell phone communications  @xcite",
    ". a more classical source of information in this issue is the census . among other data ,",
    "respondents are requested by the census officers their place of residence and work .",
    "census information is less detailed when considered at the individual level , but it has the advantage of covering a significant part of the population of full countries .",
    "recent works analyzing mobile phone records have shown that people spend most of their time in a few locations  @xcite .",
    "these locations are likely to be those registered in the census and , indeed , census - based information has been also used recently to forecast the propagation patterns of infectious diseases such as the latter influenza pandemic  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we follow a similar approach and use the recurrent mobility information collected in the us census as a proxy for individual social context . this localized environment for each individual accounts mostly for face - to - face interactions and leaves",
    "aside other factors , global in nature , such as information coming from online media , radio and tv .",
    "our results show that a model implementing face - to - face contacts through recurrent mobility and influence as imperfect random imitation is able to reproduce geographical and temporal patterns for the fluctuations in electoral results at different scales .",
    "we have investigated the voting patterns in the us on the county level .",
    "we have used the votes for presidential elections in years 1980 - 2012 . for each county @xmath0 , we have data about the county geographic position , area , adjacency with other counties as well as data regarding population @xmath1 , and number of voters @xmath2 for each party @xmath3 for every election year @xmath4 ( note that @xmath5 , since not everybody is entitled to vote ) .",
    "raw vote counts are not very useful for comparing the counties as populations are distributed heterogeneously",
    ". therefore we switch from vote counts to vote shares @xmath6    since the votes received by parties others than republicans and democrats are minority , we have focused on the two main parties .",
    "we have further considered mostly relative voteshares @xmath7 , which are absolute vote shares minus the national average for a given party every electoral year @xmath8 where i stands for the number of counties .",
    "the relative voteshares show how much above ( positive ) or below ( negative ) the national average are the results in given county .",
    "+ our main focus is on the persistence of voting patterns . we define a _ stronghold _ to be a county which relative voteshare remains systematically positive ( or negative ) .      in the sirm model",
    "@xmath9 agents live in a spatial system divided in non - overlapping cells .",
    "the @xmath9 agents are distributed among the different cells according to their residence cell .",
    "the number of residents in a particular cell @xmath10 will be called @xmath11 . while many of these individuals may work at @xmath10",
    ", some others will work at different cells .",
    "this defines the fluxes @xmath12 of residents of @xmath10 recurrently moving to @xmath13 for work . by consistency , @xmath14 .",
    "the working population at cell @xmath10 is @xmath15 and the total population in the system ( country ) is @xmath16 . in this work ,",
    "the spatial units correspond to the us counties and the population levels , @xmath11 , and commuting flows , @xmath12 , are directly obtained from the 2000 census .",
    "we describe agents opinion by a binary variable with possible values @xmath17 or @xmath18 .",
    "the main variables are the number of individuals @xmath19 holding opinion @xmath17 , living in county @xmath10 and working at @xmath13 .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath20 stands for the number of voters living in @xmath10 holding opinion @xmath17 and @xmath21 for the number of voters working at @xmath13 holding opinion @xmath17 .",
    "we assume that each individual interacts with people living in her own location ( family , friends , neighbors ) with a probability @xmath22 , while with probability @xmath23 she does so with individuals of her work place . once an individual interacts with others , its opinion is updated following a noisy voter model @xcite : an interaction partner is chosen and the original agent copies her opinion imperfectly ( with a certain probability of making mistakes ) .",
    "a more detailed description of the sirm model can be found in @xcite .",
    "pursuing the topic of persistence and changes in opinion , as expressed by voting results , we have investigated the _ strongholds _ of both parties in usa .",
    "figure [ strongholds ] shows the spatial arrangement and the duration of the strongholds ( measured in elections ) for data of the us presidential elections during the period 1980 - 2012 and simulations using the electoral results of 1980 as initial condition .",
    "it can be seen at a glance , that the strongholds are not randomly distributed across the country , but clustered .",
    "this indicates that some form of correlation is present between the voting patterns .",
    "the republican strongholds seem to be concentrated mostly in the central - west , while democrat strongholds are dispersed mostly through the eastern parts , including urbanized areas .",
    "this is in agreement with the population distributions , republican strongholds being mostly lower populated counties , while democrats strongholds include some significant cities .",
    "we quantify in figure [ strongholds_decay ] the temporal evolution of the strongholds of the election data for the period 1980 - 2012 as well as for the strongholds forecasted by simulations after 9 elections .",
    "the influence of the commuting network and their interactions was revealed by contrasting the simulations results with and without network interaction .",
    "the evolution of the number of strongholds observed in the data at early stages is well described by the model with commuting interactions . for longer times",
    ", the model predicts that the number of strongholds will decay with time following an exponential law as shown in figure [ strongholds_decay ] . in the absence of commuting interaction ,",
    "the number of strongholds decreases at a slower rate .",
    "furthermore , the model overestimate the number of strongholds in this case since no other mechanisms than internal fluctuations act driving the county relative voteshare @xmath7 towards the average .",
    "counties set as strongholds at the beginning of the simulation remains strongholds for a longer time .",
    "we further test the accuracy of our model by computing the percentage of strongholds accurately predicted .",
    "as figure [ percenthits ] shows , the model with no commuting interactions reproduces a higher percentage of strongholds , however , it also gives higher and increasing number of false positives . on the contrary ,",
    "the model with commuting interactions maintain a flat rate of false positive below 20% .",
    "the accuracy of the model in this case remain higher than 50% after @xmath24 elections .",
    "another question is what determines how long a county would be a stronghold for ?",
    "we try to answer this question for the model by looking into the dependence of the strongholds duration with respect to the initial voteshare of the counties .",
    "as figure [ strongholds_cidependence ] shows , there is a linear dependence for the duration of being a stronghold with the distance to the mean voteshare .",
    "counties with initial larger deviation from the mean voteshare tend to be strongholds longer time .",
    "the fitting reveals that every tenth of relative voteshare corresponds on average to a stronghold duration of @xmath25 elections .",
    "we have studied the persistence on the electoral system using the recently introduced social influence and recurrent mobility ( sirm ) model for opinion dynamics which includes social influence with random fluctuations , mobility and population heterogeneities across the u.s .",
    "the model accurately predicts generic features of the background fluctuations of evolution of vote - share fluctuations at different geographical scales ( from the county to the state level ) , but it does not aim at reproducing the evolution of the average vote - share .    we have contrasted the evolution of the number of strongholds of the election data for the period 1980 - 2012 with the strongholds forecasted by simulations finding a good agreement between them .",
    "the evolution of the number of strongholds observed in the electoral data at early stages is well described by the model with commuting interactions . however , the number of strongholds observed in the data changes abruptly after the presidential election of 2008 .",
    "our model is not able / does not intend to reproduce this behavior since it involves external driving forces not included in the model .",
    "our results also shows a good agreement between data and simulations for the location and duration of the strongholds .",
    "strongholds are not randomly distributed across the country , but clustered .",
    "this indicates that some form of correlation is present between the voting patterns .",
    "the model reproduces nicely the spatial concentration of the both types of strongholds .",
    "republican strongholds are mostly concentrated in the central - west , while democrat strongholds are dispersed mostly through the eastern parts , including urbanized areas .    as for the duration of the strongholds , we have found a linear dependence for the duration of being a stronghold with the distance to the mean voteshare .",
    "counties with initial larger deviation from the mean voteshare tend to be strongholds for a longer time , on average , 5 elections for each tenth of relative voteshare . when commuting interactions are taken into consideration , our model exhibits an accuracy higher than 50% for up to @xmath24 elections .",
    "the lack of this interactions causes an overestimation of the number of strongholds with an associated increase of the number of false positive decreasing the prediction accuracy of the model .",
    "our contribution sets the ground to include other important aspects of voting behavior and demand further investigation of the role played by heterogeneities in the micro - macro connection .",
    "further elements will have to be included in order to produce predictions mimicking more accurately real electoral results .",
    "some examples are the effects of social and communication media or the erosion of the governing party .",
    "the use of alternative communication channels is expected to affect voting behavior ."
