    "the general catalogue of variable stars ( gcvs ) @xcite gives a determination of mira ( omicron ) ceti - type variables : `` these are long - period variable giants with characteristic late - type emission spectra ( me , ce , se ) and variation amplitudes from 2.5 to 11 magnitudes in @xmath6",
    ". their periodicity is well pronounced , and the periods lie in the range between 80 and 1000 days .",
    "infrared amplitudes are usually less than those in the visible and may be @xmath7 2.5 mag .",
    "for example , in the _ k _ band they usually do not exceed 0.9 mag . ''",
    "due to the large amplitude of variability exceeding 2.5 mag in the _ v _ band , mira variables in nearby galaxies may be confused with optical novae .",
    "the confusion can be solved , if subsequent spectral or photometric investigations reveal a mira - type star with a cool m - type spectrum and a long periodic variability .",
    "recently , peculiar red novae were introduced as a new class of astrophysical objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is represented by stars such as v838 mon , v4332 sgr and v1006/7 in m31 .",
    "nova sgr 1943 ( v1148 sgr ) may possibly also belong to this class .",
    "their remnants may be cool luminous l- or m - type supergiants , which in the course of discovery may be confused with both mira - type stars and classical novae .",
    "nova sgr 1943 reached a maximum photometric brightness of 8.0 mag , it was described by @xcite as a late k - type star with tio bands in the spectrum .",
    "it was found that the star is not of mira - type , and later the star was lost .    in a search for novae in nearby galaxies one may run into similar problems .",
    "a cool supergiant may be misidentified as a nova when an unfiltered ccd image is compared with @xmath8 or @xmath6 images .",
    "the m31 nova candidate 2008 - 09b @xcite turned out to be a star with m9-type spectrum .",
    "it may be a red nova or even a red supergiant showing no variability at all .",
    "there are two additional nova candidates in m31 that turned out to be luminous mira - type stars : m31n 1995 - 11e @xcite , m31n 2007 - 11 g @xcite .",

    "an outburst of a source with coordinates @xmath9 , @xmath10 ( j2000 ) in m33 was detected by @xcite .",
    "they reported it as a possible nova ( with 18.6 mag ) detected in five frames taken around 2009 august 17.807 ut exposed by 60 sec using the 0.40-m f/9.8 reflector and unfiltered ccd of the miyaki argenteus observatory , japan , reaching a limiting magnitude of 20.2 .",
    "nothing was visible at this location on their previous frames taken on 2008 december 25.559 ut and 2009 august 07.737 ut with limiting magnitudes of 20.0 and 19.4 , respectively .",

    "dozens of images were found , most of them come from medium - size telescopes equipped with wide field mosaic ccd cameras .",
    "the star position is well placed on the frames of the calar alto observatory taken in 1989 and 1998 with the 80/120-cm schmidt telescope , on the frames taken in 2001 and 2002 in @xmath15 bands with the 8.2-m subaru telescope of the national astronomical observatory of japan .",
    "one @xmath6 band observation from the 4.2-m william herschel telescope , and three sdss @xmath16 band observations from the 2.54-m isaac newton telescope were used as well , both telescopes belong to the isaac newton group of telescopes at the roque de los muchachos observatory at la palma , spain .",

    "we created a finding chart for the star from high - quality @xmath0 band image taken with the subaru telescope on 2002 november 4 ( fig .",
    "a relatively bright visual companion is located 2.1 arcsec north - east of the variable .",
    "@xcite cataloged the position of this star as @xmath21 , @xmath22 ( j2000 ) and give @xmath8 , @xmath6 , @xmath0 , and @xmath17 band magnitudes of 21.40 , 21.11 , 20.94 , and 20.71 , respectively .",
    "the observations of the lggs @xcite were obtained from october 2000 to september 2001 . the variable star is not included in the catalog , as it is only detected on the @xmath17 band image taken during the survey on 2001 september 18 ( criterion for inclusion in catalog is detection in the three bands @xmath23 ) .",
    "most of the data in table 1 relate to the light curve maximum . both ascending and descending branches of the light curve are not fully covered .",
    "the observations during these phases come mostly from the survey by @xcite .",
    "the survey presents observations when the star had a brightness between 22 and 25 mag in the @xmath0 band .",
    "the accuracy of these observations @xcite varies from 0.04 mag at @xmath0 = 22 mag to 0.37 mag at @xmath0 = 25 mag .    to search for periodicities we used a method proposed by @xcite which is based on the phase dispersion minimization . in this search",
    "we used only the observations in _",
    "r _ band because they represent the best sampling among the total data set .",
    "the periodogram was calculated in the period range between 200 and 7000 days ( fig .",
    "the output parameter there is the inverse dispersion value @xmath24 described by @xcite , maxima in the periodogram correspond to dispersion minima .",
    "there are essentially no peaks with period values less than 200 days .",
    "this range of periods is not shown in the figure .",
    "a period of 665 days shows the highest amplitude .",
    "there are two lower amplitude peaks at 3500 and 406 days ( fig .",
    "2 ) . however , these periods give much worse light curves .",
    "longer periods contradict with the fast changes of brightness on ascending and descending branches of the light curve @xcite .",
    "the phased light curve in the @xmath0 band is presented in fig .",
    "it was calculated with the following light elements @xmath25 [ efemeries ]    figure 3 shows that we do not resolve and possibly not even cover the minimum of the light curve .",
    "the star in minimum brightness is not brighter than @xmath0 = 25.4 mag .",
    "the total amplitude of the variability is bigger than 7 mag in the @xmath0 band .",
    "also the ascending branch is not well covered .",
    "therefore , the epoch of the maximum can only be constrained to @xmath26 days .",
    "however , it is obvious that the light curve of this mira variable is asymmetric , the ascending branch is steeper than the descending one .",
    "we tried to refine the maximum in the light curve using archival observations of the infrared satellite spitzer @xcite . in five observations on 2004 january 09 , july 22 , august 16 , and 2005 january 21 and august 25 , the star varied in the range of 14.24  14.97 mag , 14.16  14.64 mag , and 13.66 - 14.04 mag in the 3.6 , 4.5 , and 8 @xmath27 m bands , respectively .",
    "a maximum is found during july / august 2004 corresponding to phases in the interval 0.180.22 according to equation 1 .",
    "therefore the infrared maximum seems not to be in phase with the optical maximum exactly , but it is very close to it ( see fig .",
    "the calibrated spectrum of [ hbs2006 ] 40671 in the 4300 - 7880   spectral region is shown in fig .",
    "4 . molecular tio bands dominate in the spectrum .",
    "we classify the star as an oxygen - rich ( m - type or o mira ) star @xcite .",
    "strong narrow emission lines of hydrogen are present as well ; this is typical for mira stars during maximum light . using the spectrum we estimate a contribution of the tio bands into the star brightness in @xmath8 and @xmath6 bands .",
    "they are @xmath280.28 mag and @xmath290.16 mag .",
    "these values agree with the spectral type m1  m2 @xcite .",
    "we have also determined the spectral type of the star using [ tio]@xmath30 and [ tio]@xmath31 indices introduced by @xcite and measured in our calibrated spectrum .",
    "the spectral indices were derived from fluxes measured in 30    bandpasses centered at three wavelengths each for [ tio]@xmath30 ( 6125 , 6180 and 6370  ) and for [ tio]@xmath31 ( 7025 , 7100 and 7400  ) as [ tio]@xmath32 and [ tio]@xmath33 , respectively .",
    "these index values correspond to spectral class m3 .",
    "such a spectrum is natural for mira variables in maximum light , while in the minimum they have usually later spectra .",
    "the h@xmath34 emission line of [ hbs2006 ] 40671 is very narrow and not resolved in our spectrum .",
    "its equivalent width is ew = 9  .",
    "for h@xmath34 we measure a heliocentric radial velocity of @xmath35 km / s .",
    "that this high radial velocity is not caused by calibration problems was verified by measuring the radial velocity of the [ oi ] @xmath366300 sky line which was determined as as expected .",
    "also , at a distance of @xmath37 from [ hbs2006 ] 40671 , by chance the high ionization hii region z378 @xcite was captured in the slit .",
    "the heliocentric radial velocity of its h@xmath34 line is @xmath38 km / s .",
    "this velocity is in good agreement with that of the hi radio emission at the position ( @xmath39 km / s , * ? ? ?",
    "the difference of @xmath40 between the hii region and the star s location in the galaxy body may produce a radial velocity shift of 5  10 km / s .",
    "therefore we find a strong negative excess in the h@xmath34 radial velocity of [ hbs2006 ] 40671 of @xmath41 km / s over the galaxy radial velocity .    to check whether this negative excess of the h@xmath34 radial velocity also is reflected in other features of the spectrum of [ hbs2006 ] 40671 , we cross - correlated it with spectra of known standard stars .",
    "we used two red variables , v934 her ( hd 154791 , 4u 1700 + 24 , m2 iii ) and kk per ( hd 13136 , m2 iab - ib ) .",
    "the cross - correlation region was 5850  6700  excluding h@xmath42 emission and interstellar nai lines .",
    "the spectrum of v934 her was taken with the sao 1-m zeiss telescope on 2006 april 6.95 ut . according to @xcite it is an x - ray binary with a period of p = 404 @xmath433  days .",
    "the radial velocity amplitude of the primary is only k = 0.75 @xmath430.12  km / s .",
    "the systemic velocity of v934 her is @xmath440.1  km / s .",
    "the cross - correlation resulted in a radial velocity of @xmath45  km / s for the mira star .",
    "we obtained almost the same value ( @xmath46  km / s ) using the second standard star kk per ( its radial velocity is @xmath470.4  km / s , * ? ? ?",
    "we conclude that the star has a big negative peculiar radial velocity compared to the body of the galaxy ( hi data ) of @xmath48  km / s .",
    "its h@xmath42 emission is redshifted relative to the star by @xmath49  km / s .",
    "such a shift might be explained by stellar pulsations .",
    "however , it could also be caused by the superposition of the emission line on an absorption line that is not resolved in our spectrum .",
    "the huge peculiar velocity can not be explained by the star binarity . to get an orbital velocity of @xmath50  km / s in a few solar mass binary",
    "the orbital period must be less than 10 days , and the orbital separation less than 0.2  a.u .",
    "this is impossible due to the huge sizes of miras .",
    "we tried to investigate if [ hbs2006 ] 40671 is positioned in front of or behind the disk of m33 which would indicate motion away from or to the disk , respectively .",
    "however , the signal to noise of the spectrum in the range of expected diffuse interstellar bands ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was not sufficient .",
    "according to our data from the 6-m and 1-m telescopes , the observed photometric colours of [ hbs2006 ] 40671 during maximum are @xmath51 and @xmath52 mag . taking into account the distance modulus of m33 @xmath53 mag ( the distance @xmath54 kpc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the galactic extinction value @xmath55 mag ( @xmath56 mag ) in that direction @xcite we find an absolute magnitude of the star near maximum brightness ( v@xmath57 mag at the pulsation phase 0.05 ) of m@xmath58 .",
    "this is consistent with luminosity classes ib  iab . for an m3-type star",
    "the bolometric correction amounts to @xmath42.34 mag @xcite .",
    "this leads to a bolometric magnitude in the brightness maximum of m@xmath59 .",
    "unfortunately , we have not enough data to estimate @xmath6 band pulsation magnitude or mean magnitude",
    ".    2mass data @xcite show [ hbs2006 ] 40671 on 1997 december 5 , in the pulsation phase of 0.54 , at a brightness of 17.30 @xmath60 , 15.89 @xmath61 and 15.45 @xmath62 mag in @xmath63 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "there are more observations of the star in the @xmath64 bands taken from 2005 september 29 to december 16 ( pulsation phases 0.840.96 ) with the 3.8-m ukirt telescope equipped with wfcam @xcite .",
    "the brightness of the star during this period was 16.86 , 16.24 and 15.66 mag in the @xmath64 bands , respectively .",
    "these data confirm the typical mira behaviour , i.e. the decrease of pulsation amplitude with increasing wavelength .",
    "however we have not enough data to study the infrared light curve in detail .",
    "@xcite found that the @xmath1 band amplitudes of o mira variables is smaller for shorter periods . from the relations in that paper ,",
    "the o mira variables with periods longer than 420 days should show total @xmath1 amplitudes smaller than 0.4 mag .",
    "we use the 2mass data for a luminosity estimate .",
    "we find an absolute magnitude of the [ hbs2006 ] 40671 as m@xmath65 with a possible error of . applying a bolometric correction of @xmath66 mag determined by @xcite to this @xmath1 band magnitude we find m@xmath67 .",
    "@xcite present period - luminosity ( pl ) relations for lmc mira variables , where they found that the o mira variables with periods longer than @xmath68  days are overluminous ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "fitting the overluminous branch of the long - period mira variables ( without the star c2 whose status is less certain , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we find for our star with the 665-day period that the expected mean luminosity is m@xmath69 mag .",
    "this agrees well with our estimate from the 2mass data . using pl relations for bolometric luminosities for the overluminous long - period mira variables both from @xcite and @xcite we find very similar results , the mean expected luminosity for the 665-day star is m@xmath70 mag .",
    "this value is close to m@xmath67 , found above from the 2mass data taken in the minimum .",
    "on the basis of our spectral classification , we determined the bolometric luminosity of @xmath71 mag is in the brightness maximum .",
    "the bolometric luminosities of o - type mira variables are notably changing during the pulsation cycle . using the relations found by @xcite",
    "one may expect that in o mira variables with periods longer than 420 days the difference between maximal and mean bolometric luminosity is larger than 0.5 mag .",
    "we conclude that luminosities of [ hbs2006 ] 40671 found by us are in line with the statistical relations , but the star s parameters put it in the extreme tail of these relations .    in the presence of the huge amplitude of [ hbs2006 ] 40671 in the @xmath0 band , not less than 7 mag",

    "40671 is similar to the mira - type variable discovered by @xcite in the ic1613 galaxy ( m@xmath73 mag and @xmath74  day ) .",
