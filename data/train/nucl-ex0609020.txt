    "the primary goal of the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) is to produce and study a state of high density deconfined nuclear matter called the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "measurements of the production of @xmath0-meson created at rhic au+au collisions can provide insight on the dense matter created in the collisions .",
    "because @xmath0-meson is expected to have a small cross - section for interactions with other non - strange particles , and its life time is relatively long ( @xmath341 fm/@xmath4 ) , it may keep information of the early stage of the system s evolution .",
    "the observation of meson and baryon grouping in the nuclear modification factor ( @xmath5 ) and elliptic flow ( @xmath1 ) measurements at intermediate transverse momentum ( @xmath6 ) @xcite has been interpreted as a manifestation of bulk partonic matter hadronization through multi - parton dynamic such as recombination / coalescence of partons @xcite .",
    "@xmath0-meson provides unique sensitivity to test these theoretical scenarios , since @xmath0-meson has a mass heavier than proton and close to the lambda while it is a meson .",
    "the hypothesis of kaon coalescence as a dominant source for @xmath0-meson production has been ruled out from the star 2002 measurements @xcite .",
    "if @xmath0 flows , it may be a strong signal of the partonic collectivity formed at rhic . based upon these reasons , the studies on the property of @xmath0-meson at rhic energies",
    "is of great interest .",

    "dashed lines represent the exponential fits to the distributions and dotted lines are the results of levy function fits .",
    "error bars represent statistic errors only.[fig1 ] ]     spectra among different collision systems ( au+au , d+au and pp at @xmath8 gev ) in their most central centrality bins.[fig2 ] ]    insight into particle production can be gained by examining the shape of the @xmath0-meson @xmath6 distributions as a function of centrality @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the @xmath0-meson transverse momentum distributions as a function of centralities for au + au collisions ( runiv ) at @xmath9 gev @xcite .",
    "it is observed that the shape of the spectra evolves as a function of centrality .",
    "the central data can be fitted equally well by both exponential function and levy functions , while the more peripheral spectra can only be fitted better by the levy function . comparing with the peripheral data ,",
    "the yield at high-@xmath6 region for central data is suppressed .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] @xcite shows the comparison among different reaction systems ( au+au at 200 gev / c , d+au at 200 gev / c and p+p at 200 gev / c ) in their most central bins .",
    "the fact that the @xmath10 normalized spectra of au+au collisions at 200 gev is an exponential shape and those of d+au and p+p at 200 gev / c are levy shapes may indicate different reaction mechanism",
    ". the exponential shape at central 200gev / c au+au data may be hints of thermalization of the system too .",
    "recently , it was predicted @xcite that the dominant production mechanism for @xmath0-meson , ( and similarly for the multi - strange baryon , @xmath2 ) , in the range 2@xmath11 8 gev / c is the thermal recombination of strange quarks while the contribution from fragmentation processes in this @xmath6 range is suppressed by a few orders of the magnitude in comparison",

    "it is clearly seen that the model describes data well with @xmath6 up to @xmath3 4 gev / c while the deviation at higher @xmath6 range may imply that the contribution to particle production from fragmentation processes is larger than that expected by the model .     and @xmath2 @xmath6 spectra for most central collisions compared to the recombination model predictions @xcite .",
    "the sum of all contributions to the model is shown as the solid lines and the thermal - thermal ( tt ) recombination is indicated by the dashed lines .",

    "@xmath16 and @xmath15 also agree within errors @xcite .",
    "the results agree with na49 s @xcite , but disagree with na50 s @xcite .",
    "thus there is still something for @xmath0 production to be learned . in this case , the di - electrons channel for @xmath0-meson production measurement from star will be of great interest .",
    "this measurement will be achieved with the planned upgrade of the star detector with a full - barrel time of flight detector ( tof ) which is expected to significantly increase the particle identification capability @xcite .",

    "the shaded bands represent the uncertainties in the glauber model calculations for @xmath21@xmath22@xmath23 and @xmath21@xmath24@xmath23.[fig5 ] ]    from the figure , we can see that at intermediate @xmath6 , the @xmath5 of baryon ( @xmath18 ) is larger than that of mesons ( @xmath19 and @xmath0 ) , which implies that particle production in this @xmath6 region is driven by the particles types , not by their masses since @xmath0-meson s mass is close to @xmath18 while it is a meson .",
    "the @xmath5 results are consistent with the partonic recombination model predictions @xcite that the centrality dependence of the yield at intermediate @xmath6 depends more strongly on the number of constituent quarks than on the particle mass .",
    "there also may be a tendency for values of @xmath5 for all particles to approach each other at higher @xmath6 .",
    "in non - central au+au collisions , the overlap region is anisotropic ( nearly elliptic ) .",
    "large pressure built up in the collision center results in pressure gradient which is dependent on azimuthal angle , which generates anisotropy in momentum space , namely elliptic flow .",
    "once the spatial anisotropy disappears due to the anisotropic expansion , development of elliptic flow also ceases .",
    "this kind of self - quenching process happens quickly , therefore elliptic flow is primarily sensitive to the early stage equation of state ( eos ) @xcite .",

    "@xmath1 of @xmath27+@xmath28 and @xmath29 from @xcite are plotted together for comparison .",
    "the most striking thing in the figure is that the @xmath0-meson has a non - zero @xmath1 in the hydrodynamic region ( @xmath30 gev/@xmath4 ) and it has a significant @xmath1 signal at @xmath31 gev/@xmath4 which is comparable to that of the @xmath27+@xmath28 . since the formation of @xmath0-meson through kaon coalescence at rhic has been ruled out by previous star measurements @xcite , and the low interaction cross - section of @xmath0-meson with other non - strange particles makes the contribution to flow due to hadronic re - scattering processes very small @xcite , therefore it may be possible to directly measure the flow of strange quark via the flow of @xmath0-meson .",
    "additionally , since the @xmath0-meson @xmath1 values as a function of @xmath6 are similar to those of other particles , this indicates that the heavier @xmath32-quarks flow as much as the lighter @xmath33 and @xmath34 quarks .",
    "this can happen if there are a significant number of interactions between the quarks before hadronization .",
    "it is the signal of partonic collectivity of the system .",
    "a prediction @xcite from the naive coalescence model which is implemented in a multi - phase transport ( ampt ) model with the string melting scenario @xcite is also plotted here .",
    "the model describes the data quite well at @xmath35 gev / c .",
    "this is another hint of coalescence of strange quark as dominant production mechanism for @xmath0-meson .",
    "further evidence can be obtained from the number - of - constituent - quark ( ncq ) picture in figure  [ fig6 ] ( right panel ) .",
    "the strong suppression of high-@xmath6 particle yield  @xcite and the disappearance of one jet in back - to - back jet correlation  @xcite have been observed in rhic au + au central collisions at @xmath36 = 200 gev , which can be interpreted by jet quenching mechanism  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the lost energy will be redistributed in the soft @xmath25 region .",
    "these soft associated particles which carry the lost energy have been reconstructed via two - particle azimuthal angular correlation of charged particles in star experiment @xcite , and the interesting mach - like structure has been experimentally observed in au + au collisions at @xmath36 = 200 gev  @xcite as well as theoretically interpreted .",
    "for instance , it was proposed that a mach shock wave happens when jet travels faster than sound in the medium @xcite , or it can also be produced with a cherenkov radiation mechanism @xcite , or was attributed to medium dragging effect in ref .",
    "@xcite etc .",
    "in addition , partonic transport model is able to give the mach - like cone phenomenon for central au+au collisions at rhic and shows the parton cascade is essential for describing experimental mach - like structure @xcite .    in this section ,",
    "we shall present two - particle correlation function , especially for those trigged by multi - strange particles , such as @xmath0 and @xmath2 with higher @xmath25 which is beyond the @xmath25 region we discussed in the section of @xmath26 , to further understand behavior of @xmath0 mesons .",

    "it is possible to induce such kind of picture if the jet velocity is faster than the sound velocity when it passes through the dense matter .",
    "also the deflect may occur when the associated particles try to traverse the dense qcd medium . from the comparison of different triggers , it is found that a little wider for away - side correlations trigged by any hadrons than the one trigged by @xmath0 or @xmath2 , while it keeps almost same width for near - side peaks . the former may indicate that @xmath32 or @xmath38 quarks has weak partonic interactions with @xmath33 or @xmath34 quarks , which results in a narrower width of away - side peaks for @xmath0/@xmath2-trigged correlation . of course , we selected a little wider @xmath25 range for @xmath0 and @xmath2 triggers due to the limited statistics , which may have a small effect on the differences of di - hadron correlations .",

    "the measurement of @xmath0-meson transverse momentum spectra as a function of centrality for au+au collisions at @xmath36 = 200 gev shows that for peripheral collisions , the spectra has a deviation of exponential shape because of the distinct power - law tail and are best described by a levy function while for the central data , the power - law tail is suppressed and it can be well described by both levy or exponential function . in other words , clear central suppression of transverse momentum spectra has been observed .",
    "collisions among different systems ( au+au , d+au , p+p at @xmath36 = 200 gev ) indicate that the central suppression only exists in the au + au systems .",
    "the satr measurement of nuclear modification factor ( @xmath5 ) conclusively demonstrated that the @xmath0-meson @xmath5 is much similar to the @xmath5 of @xmath43 than @xmath18 , which confirms the grouping of hadron @xmath5 observable at rhic is a baryon - meson type dependence but not a mass type dependence .",
