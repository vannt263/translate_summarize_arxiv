    "the advent of deep radio surveys reaching flux densities well below 1 mjy ( mitchell & condon 1985 ; windhorst et al .",

    "; hopkins et al . 1998",
    "; richards 2000 ) revealed a new population of faint sources more numerous than the agn - powered radio galaxies dominating the strong - source population .",
    "this corresponds to a steepening of the differential source counts over non - evolving predictions at levels @xmath11 mjy .",
    "the faint counts suggest that significant evolution has occured over the redshift range spanned by the observed population .",
    "photometric and spectroscopic studies ( thuan et al . 1984 ; windhorst et al . 1985 ; thuan & condon 1987 ; benn et al .",
    "1993 ) suggest that the faint excess at 1.4 ghz is composed predominately of star - forming galaxies similar to the nearby starburst population dominating the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( _ iras _ ) 60-@xmath12 m counts ( benn et al .",
    "indeed , this is supported by the strong correlation between radio ( 1.4 ghz ) and far - infrared ( 60-@xmath12 m ) flux densities of disk galaxies ( helou , soifer & rowan - robinson 1985 ) , implying a significant proportion of starburst galaxies at faint radio flux densities .",
    "the overall observed source - count distribution from faint ( @xmath12jy ) to bright ( @xmath13mjy ) flux densities can not be explained by starbursts alone .",
    "evolutionary models of radio source counts need to invoke two separate populations ( eg .",
    "danese et al .",
    "1987 ; rowan - robinson et al . 1993 ; hopkins et al . 1998 ) .",
    "condon ( 1989 ) describes these populations as starbursts and monsters , each powered by different mechanisms : ` starbursts ' deriving their radio emission from supernova remnants and hii regions and ` monsters ' from compact nuclear related activity ( eg .",
    "active galactic nuclei ; agns ) .",
    "the proportion of agn is much greater at higher flux densities @xmath13 mjy ( kron , koo & windhorst 1985 ; gruppioni et al .",
    "1998 ) , where a majority are associated with classical radio galaxies exhibiting extended ( fri and frii - type ) morphologies ( fanaroff & riley 1974 ) . the optical counterparts to sources at bright radio flux densities @xmath14 mjy is comprised mostly of ellipticals while at sub - mjy to @xmath12jy levels , the optical counterparts are identified as blue galaxies exhibiting peculiar ( compact , interacting and irregular ) morphologies ( kron , koo & windhorst 1985 ; gruppioni et al .",
    "studies of faint radio sources , namely their stellar population , how they evolve with redshift , and how they relate to local normal galaxies is progressing rapidly , however , much remains to be learned from the faintest ( @xmath12jy ) radio populations at redshifts @xmath15 .",
    "radio surveys are insensitive to the effects of absorption by dust which is known to bias surveys severely at optical / uv wavelengths .",
    "this is particularly important for derivations of the cosmic history of star formation and its relation to hierarchical models of galaxy formation .",
    "optical / uv studies have shown that there is an increase in both the space density of star - forming , morphologically disturbed galaxies ( eg . richards et al .",
    "1999 ) and also , the global star formation rate with redshift to @xmath16 ( eg . madau et al .",
    "similar evidence is emerging from studies of sub - mm sources ( blain et al .",
    "1999 ) and amongst the faint radio population at @xmath15 - the redshift range probed by the deepest surveys ( eg . cram 1998 ; haarsma et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "there has been much speculation as to whether global star - formation rates ( sfrs ) derived from radio observations exceed those determined from optical / uv studies .",
    "cram et al .",
    "( 1998 ) note that systematic discrepancies may exist between the various star formation indicators , which are not well understood ( see also schaerer 1999 ) .",
    "it is encouraging to see however that haarsma et al .",
    "( 2000 ) find global sfrs derived from 1.4ghz observations of the hubble deep field to exceed optically detetermined values by a factor of a few out to @xmath17 . indeed , an analysis of balmer decrements and optical  near - infrared colors in star forming galaxies by georgakakis et al .",
    "( 1999 ) from the phoenix deep survey ( hopkins et al .",
    "1998 ) , finds evidence for visual extinctions from one to a few magnitudes .",
    "currently , about 20% of existing micro - jansky radio samples remain unidentified to @xmath18 mag in hubble deep field images ( eg .",
    "richards et al .",
    "a majority of these could represent a significant population of dust - enshrouded starbursts and/or agn at high redshift .",
    "these results are in support of efforts to further understand the dust properties of star - forming galaxies .",
    "the primary aim of this paper is to introduce a new complete sample of radio sources selected at 1.4 ghz , uniformly selected over the flux range @xmath19 mjy ( 5@xmath20 ) from an area covering @xmath21 .",
    "although much larger area surveys to deeper radio sensitivities have been carried out ( eg .",
    "hopkins et al .",
    "1998 ) , the present study reports the results of more sensitive optical observations . archival near - infrared data for a subset of the sample are also presented .",
    "the near - infrared data is from the ongoing 2mass project , and represents a unique aspect of this study in the identification of radio - selected starbursts .",
    "although we currently lack valuable spectroscopic information , we combine radio  near - infrared  optical flux ratios , radio maps , and optical images to explore the properties of the entire sample .",
    "our deep optical identifications provide the opportunity to asses the importance of dust in star - forming systems via the observed radio  to  optical and near - infrared  to  optical colors .",
    "simple stellar synthesis models that include radio emission and reddening are used to constrain possible amounts of absorption .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in  2 , we discuss the radio observations and data reduction , present the radio catalog , and compare our results with data available from ( shallower ) all sky radio surveys .",
    "the optical photometric observations , their reduction and astrometric calibrations are discussed in  3 . our method for radio - optical identification ,",
    "the archival near - infrared data , radio - optical image overlays , and our optical / near - infrared catalog are presented in  4 .",
    "a study of the radio , near - infrared , and optical colors and constraints on synthesis models incorporating dust is presented in  5 .",
    "an application of our color - color analysis to select high - redshift ultraluminous infrared galaxies from deep radio surveys is discussed in  6 .",
    "all results and future prospects are summarised in  7 .",
    "observations were made with the vla c - configuration at 1.4 ghz on 1998 december 19 .",
    "this configuration yields a good compromise for resolution and surface - brigntness sensitivity .",
    "the @xmath1 confusion limit for this configuration is only @xmath22jy / beam at 1.4 ghz ( mitchell & condon 1985 ) since the synthesised beam size ( full width at half power ; fwhp ) is @xmath23 arcsec .",
    "the resulting radio positions have rms errors @xmath24 arcsec , except for extended sources with multiple components , sufficient for making optical identifications . at 1.4 ghz",
    "the fwhp of the vla primary beam is 31 arcmin and approximately corresponds to the diameter of our final imaged field .",
    "this relatively large coverage avoids field - to - field variations in source counts induced by high - redshift clustering . although surveys at higher frequencies ( eg .",
    "8 ghz ) can reach lower flux densities than at 1.4 ghz , most radio sources have spectral indices @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) so that the population being sampled is similar .",
    "to provide uniform sensitivity over the full area of our field , we observed seven positions arranged in a filled hexagonal pattern with a separation of @xmath27 between pointing centers .",
    "the resulting root mean square ( rms ) map noise is thus nearly constant ( cf .",
    "condon et al .",
    "our field was centered on ra(2000)=@xmath28 , dec.(2000)=@xmath29 .",
    "this field was chosen for its relatively low foreground galactic - cirrus emission likely to affect optical / near - infrared identifications and also for the absence of bright radio galaxies .",
    "the integration time on each pointing was @xmath24 hour .",
    "this allowed us to reach an rms noise of @xmath30jy in regions free from bright contaminating sources ( see   [ radnoise ] for more details ) .",
    "our observations were made in spectral line mode with four intermediate frequencies ( ifs ) , each divided into 7 spectral channels of width 3.125 mhz .",
    "the advantage of this mode is to minimize bandwidth smearing ( i.e. chromatic aberration ) which reduces the point - source sensitivity away from the pointing center and causes appreciable image distortion .",
    "additionally , the spectral line mode is less prone to narrowband interference noise spikes . with continuum mode",
    "however , we would have had a little over twice the bandwidth and a factor @xmath31 lower noise .",
    "the data were analysed with the nrao aips reduction package .",
    "we observed 3c 48 to calibrate the visibility amplitudes , using @xmath32 and @xmath33 jy at 1.365 and 1.435 ghz , respectively .",
    "the calibration was applied using the split task . the calibrated data from each pointing were edited and imaged separately , cleaned , and restored with 15 arcsec fwhp gaussian beams .",
    "the seven separate images were weighted and combined as described in condon et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to produce a final @xmath34 map with nearly uniform sensitivity and corrected for primary - beam attenuation .",
    "the resulting rms noise of our final map after correcting for primary - beam attenuation is not uniform over the entire field , but increases by up to 30% near a strong ( @xmath35 mjy ) source near the edge of our field . despite this variation in sensitivity",
    ", we were able to divide our @xmath36 field into four equal ( @xmath37 ) regions within which the rms noise varies by no more than a few percent .",
    "these constant - noise regions simplify the application of an automated source - finding algorithm over a single continuous region ( see below ) .",
    "the lowest and highest rms noise amongst these regions was @xmath38jy / beam and @xmath39jy / beam respectively .",
    "see table  [ tbl1 ] for the region definitions .",
    "the rms noise of each region was estimated from the gaussian core of the amplitude distribution of the pixel values as produced by the aips task imean . in figure",
    "[ pixhist ] , we show the distribution in pixel values of our entire @xmath40 field .",
    "the rms deviation in peak flux density derived from a fit to this histogram is @xmath41jy / beam .",
    "figure  [ contfull ] shows a contour map of our entire radio field .",
    "each constant - noise region in table  [ tbl1 ] was used for the source extractions . within each region ,",
    "we searched for radio sources down to a peak flux density @xmath42 times the rms value of the region .",
    "the sources were extracted by the aips task sad which uses gaussian fits to estimate the fluxes , positions , and angular sizes of the selected sources . for faint sources however , unconstrained gaussian fits may be unreliable ( see condon 1997 ) . for this reason",
    ", we adopted the following method for the source extraction : first , we ran the task sad with a @xmath43 detection threshold to obtain an initial list of candidates , we then derived the peak flux densities of the faint sources ( with @xmath44 ) using the maxfit task .",
    "this task uses a second order interpolation algorithm and is known to be more accurate .",
    "only sources with a maxfit peak flux density @xmath45 were retained .",
    "for these faint sources , the total flux density was estimated using the task imean , which integrates the ( median background subtracted ) pixel values in a specific rectangle .",
    "the rectangle was chosen to encompass as much of the source as possible .",
    "for all other parameters ( sizes , positions and position angles ) we retained the values obtained from the initial gaussian fits .",
    "only two sources had irregular morphologies showing multiple components . for these",
    ", the total ( background subtracted ) flux was determined using the task tvstat which allows an integration over a specific irregular area defined to encompass as much of the source as possible .",
    "the numbers of sources detected in each constant - noise region are summarised in table  [ tbl1 ] .",
    "a total of 62 sources were detected with flux densities @xmath45 over an area of @xmath46 .",
    "within poisson uncertainties , this number is consistent with source counts from surveys by ciliegi et al .",

    "the different components of multiple sources are labelled `` c1 '' and `` c2 '' . in figure",
    "[ fhist ] , we show the distribution of peak flux densities and the total to peak flux ratio as a function of peak flux for all sources .",
    "sources with ratios @xmath53 in figure  [ fhist]b are primarily due to uncertainties on measured fluxes as estimated from the two dimensional gaussian fits .",
    "uncertainties in peak fluxes are typically @xmath54 , while total flux estimates are more uncertain due to a sensitive dependence on the gaussian fitting procedure .",
    "errors in total fluxes are typically @xmath55 .",
    "contour maps of radio sources with available optical data are shown in figure  [ optradim ] .",
    "the @xmath36 region that we observed with the vla was also covered by the nrao vla sky survey ( condon et al .",
    "1998 , nvss ) .",
    "the nvss covers the sky north of @xmath56 at 1.4 ghz with @xmath57 resolution and limiting flux density of @xmath58 mjy ( @xmath1 ) . to this limit",
    ", 17 of our sources were found to be in common with the nvss public catalog .",
    "one source in our catalog however is a double component source and is unresolved by the nvss .",
    "a comparison of flux densities derived in this study with those from this catalog is shown in figure  [ nvss ] .",
    "it is evident that our derived flux densities are on average slightly lower than those from the nvss .",
    "this was also reported in a larger comparison study by ciliegi et al .",
    "( 1999 ) using a similar observational set - up and can be explained by the difference in resolutions used in the two surveys : @xmath59 vs. @xmath57 .",
    "high - resolution surveys tend to miss flux from low - surface - brightness emission .",
    "although the effect is only marginal for bright sources , it may become important for attempts to detect faint , low - surface - brightness objects at high redshift .",
    "optical ccd photometry of our radio field was carried out on the 5-m hale telescope at palomar observatory during the nights of 27 - 29 august 1997 .",
    "these fields were initially selected for subsequent deep mid - ir imaging with the _ wide field infrared explorer _ mission ( _ wire _ ) , but the mission failed to perform to expectations . the carnegie observatories spectroscopic multislit and imaging camera ( cosmic ; kells et al .",
    "1998 ) mounted at the @xmath60 prime focus with a tek 2k ccd was used to image nine @xmath61 fields in the gunn @xmath62 ( 6550 ) filter . each optical field",
    "comprised of three optical pointings offset by @xmath63 , each with integrations of 600 sec giving a total 1800 sec per field .",
    "this resulted in a limiting magnitude of @xmath3 mag ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the seeing was typically @xmath64 ( fwhm ) .",
    "the optical fields do not cover our entire @xmath36 radio field .",
    "the nine slightly overlapping optical fields correspond to an areal coverage @xmath65 , or about 70% of the radio map .",
    "the ccd data were reduced with standard tasks in the iraf package .",
    "frames were first bias - subtracted , then flat - fielded using dome flats .",
    "bad pixels and columns were removed by interpolating between adjacent pixels and lastly , the individual dithered frames were median combined to remove cosmic ray hits .",
    "calibration was performed using standard stars from thuan & gunn ( 1976 ) .",
    "these were used to correct for atmospheric extinction from varying airmass and provide the instrumental zero point .",
    "photometric uncertainties , estimated using these standards , are no more than @xmath66 mag .",
    "sources in the reduced optical frames were extracted using the daophot package in iraf ( stetson 1987 ) .",
    "this package has the benefit of performing photometry in crowded fields , which is the case in most regions of our optical fields .",
    "it performed the following steps : first , sources were extracted above a given threshold , given as a multiple of the total ccd noise ( sky and read noise , @xmath67 ) .",
    "we adopted threshold values of 4.5 - 5@xmath67 , just high enough to avoid large numbers of spurious detections .",
    "second , simple aperture photometry was performed on these identified sources .",
    "this required a specification of the aperture radius which is likely to contain most of the light of our target source , and width of a surrounding annulus to estimate and subtract the sky background .",
    "we adopted a radius of six arcsec and annulus width of four arcsec .",
    "next , a point spread function ( psf ) was determined in each of our nine fields .",
    "this involved an interative technique to remove contamination from neighbouring sources in crowded fields near our psf candidates .",
    "simultaneous psf fitting on all sources was then performed to identify sources which were previously hidden in crowded regions .",
    "finally , the magnitudes determined from psf fits were aperture corrected to a common aperture size as used on our standard stars .",
    "aperture corrections were typically 0.22 mag . a final visual inspection removed any spurious detections .",
    "a total of @xmath68 - 390 sources were extracted from each @xmath61 field to a limit of @xmath3 mag .",
    "previous optical surveys find typically 380 - 520 sources within this area to this limit , and the variation is primarily due to clustering .",
    "such fluctuations are found to be significant on such relatively small scales ( eg .",
    "metcalfe et al . 1991 ) .",
    "the astrometry on the optical images was based on 10 - 12 apm catlog stars in each field ( maddox et al . 1990 ) .",
    "the ccmap and cctran tasks in the iraf immcoords package were used to compute plate solutions relating pixel positions to astrometric coordinates .",
    "astrometric coordinates for all sources on the frames were then determined . by comparing the positions of several sources common to the apm catalog and our fields , we found that our rms position uncertanties are typically @xmath69 .",
    "we assigned optical identifications and estimate their reliability using a robust likelihood ratio ( @xmath70 ) analysis .",
    "this general method has frequently been used to assess identification probabilities for radio and infrared sources ( eg",
    ". de ruiter , willis & arp 1977 ; prestage & peacock 1983 ; sutherland & saunders 1992 ; lonsdale et al .",
    "the method , which computes the probability that a suggested identification is the ` true ' optical counterpart , is outlined as follows :    for each optical candidate @xmath71 in the search area of some radio source @xmath72 , we calculated the value of the dimensionless difference in radio and optical positions : @xmath73^{1/2 } , \\label{rij}\\ ] ] where the @xmath74 s and @xmath75 s represent right ascensions and declinations respectively , and @xmath20 s standard deviations .",
    "we chose a moderately large search radius of @xmath76 to allow for the maximal position uncertainties : @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( assuming @xmath79 , where @xmath80 ) .",
    "such a radius is also small enough to avoid large numbers of chance associations .",
    "given @xmath81 , we must now distinguish between two mutually exclusive possibilities : ( 1 ) the candidate is a confusing background object that happens to lie at distance @xmath81 from the radio source or ( 2 ) the candidate is the ` true ' identification that appears at distance @xmath81 owing solely to radio and optical position uncertainties .",
    "we assume that the radio and optical positions would coincide if these uncertainties were zero .",
    "this assumption however is not valid when the centroid of an extended radio source is used , and is further discussed below .    to distinguish between these cases",
    ", we compute the likelihood ratio @xmath82 , defined as : @xmath83}{2\\pi n(<m_{i } ) \\left[(\\sigma_{\\alpha_{i}}^{2 } + \\sigma_{\\alpha_{j}}^{2 } ) ( \\sigma_{\\delta_{i}}^{2 } + \\sigma_{\\delta_{j}}^{2})\\right]^{1/2 } } , \\label{lr}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 is the _ local _ surface density of objects brighter than candidate @xmath71 .",
    "the likelihood ratio @xmath82 is simply the ratio of the probability of an identification ( the rayleigh distribution : @xmath85 ) , to that of a chance association at @xmath62 ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "@xmath82 therefore represents a ` relative weight ' for each match @xmath87 , and our aim is to find an optimum cutoff @xmath88 above which a source is taken to be a reliable and likely candidate .",
    "its advantage over alternative methods ( purely based on finding the lowest random chance match , eg .",
    "downes et al .",
    "1986 ) is that it allows for a possible distant candidate to still be the ` true ' identification even when there is still a high chance of it being a spurious background source .",
    "it is important to note that our form for @xmath82 ( eq .  [ lr ] ) slightly differs from that used by earlier studies ( eg . lonsdale et al .",
    "1998 ) in that it does nt contain the multiplicative `` @xmath89 '' factor in the numerator .",
    "this factor represents the apriori probability that a `` true '' optical counterpart brighter than the flux limit exists amongst the identifications . for our purposes",
    ", we will treat @xmath82 as simply a a relative weight measure for each radio - optical match , just for the purposes of assigning an optimal cutoff for reliable identification ( see below ) .",
    "we are not concerned with its absolute value , which is required when computing formal probability measures from @xmath70 . for simplicity ,",
    "we have therefore set @xmath90 in this work .",
    "the optical surface density as a function of magnitude to be used in computing @xmath70 was determined from the total number of objects visible in our optical frames .",
    "the variation in surface density in the vicinity of each radio source caused by possible clustering effects was found to be small : no more than 5% on @xmath91 scales .",
    "the distribution of @xmath70 values for all possible radio source - candidate matches is shown by the shaded histogram in figure  [ lrhisto ] . following lonsdale et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , we generate a truly random background population with respect to the radio sources by offseting the radio source positions by @xmath92 .",
    "@xmath70 values for each radio source were then re - computed and their distribution is given by the thick - lined histogram in figure  [ lrhisto ] .",
    "a comparison of the number of associations for ( true ) radio source positions with the number of associations found for random ( offset ) positions will enable us to determine a critical value @xmath88 for reliable identification . from these distributions , we compute the reliability as a function of @xmath70 : @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the number of true and random associations respectively .",
    "the reliability computed in this way also represents an approximate measure of the identification probability for a candidate with given @xmath70 .",
    "figure  [ relfig ] illustrates the reliability as a function of @xmath70 . above @xmath96 ,",
    "the reliabilities are @xmath97 because few random associations exceed this value of @xmath70 ( fig .",
    "[ lrhisto ] ) . as a good working measure we therefore assume a cutoff @xmath98 above which a source is taken to be a likely candidate .",
    "the determination of reliabilities via the @xmath70 method is insensitive to variations in @xmath84 across the field or uncertainties in its derivation , and also the assumption of gaussian error ellipses in the radio and optical positions .",
    "such uncertainties are `` normalised out '' when one computes the ratio of random to true number of associations within a search radius when estimating the reliability ( eq .  [ reliability ] ) .",
    "lonsdale et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have shown that the absolute value of @xmath70 itself depends on the characteristics of the source population being identified ( eg .",
    "stars versus galaxies ) . different populations ( assuming they could be classified a - priori using some diagnostic ) map into different underlying surface densities at the ` identifying ' wavelength , implying that distributions in @xmath70 ( eq .  [ lr ] ) will also be different . for a robust determination of the reliability in such situations , see lonsdale et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "there are two complications to consider in the above method .",
    "the first is when one attempts to identify extended ( or resolved ) radio sources with this method . for all radio sources ,",
    "we have used the positions of centroids derived from two - dimensional gaussian fits in computing the @xmath70 for optical candidates . for unresolved sources with",
    "( gaussian fitted ) sizes @xmath99 ( the synthesised fwhp beam width ) , the source is likely to have a compact central component and the optical position is expected to lie close to its quoted radio centroid . for an extended ( resolved )",
    "source however , the radio and optical positions may differ considerably since errors in the radio centroids are only @xmath100 . in such cases , if @xmath101 the identification may still be valid , since its low @xmath70 value could purely be due to a real large positional offset .",
    "the second complication is when a radio source has more than one optical candidate within its search radius with @xmath102 .",
    "this occured in about 20% of cases and was primarily due to contaminating stars .",
    "we assess these ambiguities and increase the robustness of our identifications by visually examining all optical candidates according to the following criteria :    1 .",
    "if candidates have @xmath101 for a radio source with @xmath103 , then identification is classified as _",
    "uncertain_. 2 .",
    "if candidates have _ very low _ reliability , @xmath104 ( for _ unresolved _ radio sources ) , or there are no objects in the search radius , then radio source is classified as _",
    "empty field_. 3 .",
    "if @xmath105 , i.e. where reliability is _ moderately `` low '' _ , then identification is also uncertain .",
    "if more than one optical candidate exists with @xmath102 , then only source(s ) with extended ( galaxy - like ) optical profile is taken as the identification .",
    "point sources associated with quasar nuclei are not considered in our identification scheme due to their relatively low surface density compared to galaxies ( @xmath106 ) in sub - millijansky radio samples .",
    "5 .   for unique , @xmath102 candidates ,",
    "its optical profile is also checked for confirmation .",
    "of the 62 radio sources , 43 lie within our optically imaged @xmath65 field .",
    "we found optical identifications for 26 to @xmath3 mag with reliabilities @xmath107 .",
    "four sources have identifications classified as uncertain owing to a moderately low identification reliability of @xmath108 ( and @xmath109 ) .",
    "five more are uncertain because they have extended radio structure and large possible positional offsets between optical and radio centroid positions .",
    "eight radio sources lie in `` definite '' optical empty fields with no candidates brighter than @xmath3 mag .",
    "other optical follow - up studies found similar results .",

    "we do this by relating the star - formation rates derived from empirical calibrations involving the uv and radio bands as follows .",
    "the 1.4 ghz radio emission from star - forming systems is believed to be primarily synchrotron emission from cosmic rays accelerated in supernova remnants plus a small ( @xmath131 ) thermal contribution from hii regions ( condon & yin 1990 , condon 1992 ) .",

    "we must emphasise that this relative radio flux is only that associated with the star - formation process .",
    "possible additional contributions , such as contaminating agn , are not considered in this model .",
    "we calculated flux ratios involving the radio , near - infrared and optical bands using evolutionary synthesis models for ellipticals ( e / so ) , early ( sab / sbc ) and late ( scd / sdm ) type spirals , and `` very blue '' starbursts ( sb ) .",

    "this approximation is most accurate for the reddest wavelengths of starburst galaxy spectra ( @xmath169-@xmath170 m ) , although breaks down severely at @xmath171(calzetti et al . 1999 ) .",

    "( 1999 ) .",
    "figure  [ rr ] shows @xmath173 as a function of @xmath126 color for all sources with available optical and near - infrared data .",
    "our reason for using @xmath126 color is that the @xmath6 band yielded more `` definite '' detections than the other near - infrared bandpasses .",
    "although the numbers are still relatively small , this facilitates the best comparison with the synthesis models .",

    "figure  [ rk ] shows the radio  to  near - infrared flux ratio @xmath180 , defined analagous to eq.[[ro ] ] , as a function of @xmath126 color .",
    "the near - infrared emission is dominated by old stars and is less affected by dust than the optical .",
    "the radio  to  near - infrared flux ratio should therefore be relatively insensitive to dust . given the simplicity of our models , the two disk - like sources may not necessarily represent `` 0.1 gyr starbursts '' as indicated in fig .",
    "they could also belong to the sab / sbc or scd / sdm classes .",
    "for this to be true , the following additional components may play an important role in more ` realistic ' models : ` optically - thick ' dust that _ completely obscures _ both the @xmath6 and @xmath62 emission without causing appreciable reddening in @xmath126 color , or , contamination by at least an order of magnitude times more radio emission from a central agn than that produced purely by supernovae .",
    "the second possibility is favored by radio observations of a number of luminous infrared galaxies by norris et al .",

    "the large discrepancy between the four sources with elliptical morphologies ( labelled `` e '' ) and predictions from the early - type e / so models suggests the importance of a significant agn contribution to the radio emission .",
    "appreciable amounts of optically - thick dust suppressing the optical and near - infrared light ( except for extinction by diffuse , optically - thin dust ) is not favored by observations ( eg . goudfrooij & de jong 1995 ) .",

    "a comparison between the model @xmath180 values with actual observed values implies that such agn will contribute a factor @xmath184 times more radio emission than that produced by any underlying star formation activity in these systems .",
    "it is important to note that the ratio of agn - to - stellar powered radio activity has a huge spread for the elliptical population in general , and that the factor @xmath184 only illustrates a property specific to the ellipticals in our radio sample .    to summarise ,",
    "our use of a simple synthesis model that includes radio emission and dust reddening to analyse the properties of sub - mjy radio sources has shown the following : first , the presence of dust with extinctions @xmath185 mag and possibly greater , consistent with previous more direct determinations , and second , that the level of radio emission from non - stellar processes such as agn could be easily inferred and constrained",
    ". this will be particularly important for starbursts hosting seyfert nuclei where a comparison with more sophisticated dust models may be required to infer the relative contributions .",
    "since the emission ( and dust absorption ) properties from normal galaxy populations are reasonably well known , a color - color diagram such as fig .",
    "[ rr ] could provide a potential diagnostic for selecting ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( uligs ) to high redshift .",
    "the relatively low sensitivity of the infrared - astronomical satellite ( iras ) has primarily confined ulig selection to the local universe ( sanders & mirabel 1996 ) , although there is some speculation that recently discovered faint `` scuba '' sources at sub - millimetre wavelengths could represent their high - redshift counterparts ( eg .",

    "a study of their properties and importance to galaxy evolution therefore requires observations at wavelengths virtually immune to dust absorption .",
    "radio frequencies provide an excellent window of opportunity .",

    "we have used the synthetic seds generated by devriendt et al .",
    "( 1999 ) to model the starburst emission .",
    "these authors used a self - consistent modelling approach to predict the stellar optical / uv / near - ir emission , its reprocessing into the mid - ir  to  sub - mm by dust , and the nonthermal stellar - powered radio emission based on the empirical radio  to  far - ir luminosity correlation . due to its strong agn - dominated nature , the starburst synthetic sed predicted by devriendt et al . for mrk 273 differs appreciably from that observed in the _ radio_. for this source , we therefore used the devriendt et al .",

    "luminous systems classified as uligs however ( arp 220 and mrk 273 ) , will tend have higher radio  to  optical flux ratios which could be easily selected .",
    "this can be explained by the well - observed correlation between far - infrared luminosity and far - ir ( @xmath191m)to  optical spectral slope ( soifer et al .",
    "consequently , the most ir - luminous systems with the largest far - ir  to  optical ratios are also likely to have a high level of radio - emission due to its strong correlation with ir luminosity .",

    "thus , to limiting sensitivities reached by existing 1.4 ghz surveys , such a method may not probe the highest redshifts .",
    "nonetheless , as shown in fig .",
    "[ rkother ] , such systems could still be well separated from normal galaxies to this redshift .",
    "assuming an arp 220-like sed and moderate luminosity evolution ( @xmath196 ) , the surface density of uligs to @xmath193 is expected to be of order @xmath197 at @xmath198jy , or about @xmath199 of the integral count to this sensitivity ( richards 2000 ) .",

    "<S> radio properties are presented for 62 detected sources . </S>",
    "<S> deep optical imaging to gunn @xmath3 mag using the hale 5-m telescope covering @xmath4 is reported for a subset of 43 sources . </S>",
    "<S> this optical follow - up is much deeper than that of existing larger area radio surveys of similar radio sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> archival @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7-band photometry from the two - micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) is also presented . using a robust likelihood - ratio technique </S>",
    "<S> , we optically identified 26 radio sources with probabilities @xmath8 , nine are uncertain / ambiguous detections , and eight are empty fields . </S>",
    "<S> comparisons with a stellar synthesis model that includes radio emission and dust reddening suggests that the near - infrared  to  optical emission in a small , bright sub - sample is reddened by ` optically thin ' dust with absorption @xmath9 mag , regardless of morphological type . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with other , more direct determinations of absorption . </S>",
    "<S> the radio  to  optical(near - infrared ) flux ratios of early - type galaxies require significant contamination in the radio by an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , consistent with the current paradigm . using our simple modeling approach </S>",
    "<S> , we also discuss a potential diagnostic for selecting ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( uligs ) to @xmath10 from microjansky radio surveys . </S>"
