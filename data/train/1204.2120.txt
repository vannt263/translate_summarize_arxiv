    "the main conclusions of this research are the following :    * 1 . *",
    "the percentage of the chaotic orbits decreases as the mass of the spherical halo increases .",
    "therefore , the mass of the dark halo can be considered as an important physical quantity , acting as a controller of chaos in galaxies showing small asymmetries .",
    "one expects to observe a smaller fraction of chaotic orbits in asymmetric triaxial galaxies with a dense spherical halo , while the fraction of chaotic orbits would increases in asymmetric triaxial galaxies surrounded by less dense spherical dark halo components .",
    "it was found that the l.c.e in both the 2d and the 3d models decreases , as the mass of halo increases , while the l.c.e increases as the scale length @xmath10 of the halo increases .",
    "this means that not only the percentage of chaotic orbits , but also the degree of chaos is affected by the mass or the scale length of the spherically symmetric dark halo component .",
    "the @xmath0 gives fast and reliable results regarding the nature of motion , both in 2d and 3d galactic potentials .",
    "for all calculated orbits the results given by the @xmath0 coincide with the outcomes obtained using the l.c.e or the @xmath55 spectral method .",
    "the advantage of the @xmath0 is that is faster than the above two methods .",
