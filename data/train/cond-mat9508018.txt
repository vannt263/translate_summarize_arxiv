    "thus , the ground state of the system corresponds to some integer value of charge , and the states with different values of @xmath8 are separated from it by the electrostatic gap @xmath12 .",

    "for example , at @xmath13 the ground state can have either charge @xmath14 or @xmath3 .",

    "this discussion is done for the weak - tunneling case , but the conclusion that the peak conductance is of the order of @xmath2 is valid for the strong tunneling as well .",
    "the theory of conductance oscillations in the strong - tunneling regime is developed in sections [ spinless ] and [ withspin ] . in section [ scaling ]",
    "we discuss the scaling properties of our problem .",
    "in particular , we show that the quadratic temperature dependence of the off - peak conductance at @xmath20 is universal and holds for arbitrary transmission coefficients .",
    "let us first consider the weak - tunneling case .",
    "the linear conductance is given by eqs .",

    "one should note that in the derivation of eqs .",
    "( [ orthodox ] ) and ( [ cotunneling ] ) only the lowest - order terms of the perturbation theory in tunneling amplitudes were taken into account .",
    "this is usually justified at @xmath28 .",
    "however , it was shown in ref .",
    "that near a half - integer @xmath9 and at low temperatures the higher - order corrections lead to large logarithmic renormalizations of the tunneling amplitudes .",
    "the nature of these renormalizations can be understood in terms of the analogy@xcite between the coulomb blockade and the kondo problem .",
    "we will now discuss this analogy and correct the results ( [ orthodox ] ) and ( [ cotunneling ] ) to take into account the renormalizations of the tunneling amplitudes .    for simplicity",
    "we start with the quantum dot weakly coupled to a _ single _ lead .",
    "such a system can be described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath29 here @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the annihilation operators for the electrons in the lead and in the dot respectively , and @xmath32 is the characteristic charging energy , @xmath33 ; coupling between the dot and the lead is described by tunneling hamiltonian with the matrix element @xmath34 .",
    "finally , @xmath35 is the operator of the number of electrons in the dot , counted from that at the ground state of the system without tunneling , @xmath36 .    due to the last term in eq .",

    "the energy of such a virtual state is of the order of @xmath32 , and to complete this scattering process an electron has to tunnel from the dot to the lead .",
    "it is instructive to calculate the second - order amplitude of scattering between two states in the lead , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , near the fermi level : @xmath39 .",

    "clearly , the total amplitude diverges logarithmically at @xmath41 , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the density of states in the dot .",
    "the logarithmic singularity at @xmath44 originates from the degeneracy of the electrostatic energy for states with @xmath45 and @xmath46 extra electrons in the dot .",
    "let us now concentrate on the case of the dimensionless gate voltage @xmath9 very close to @xmath47 .",
    "in this case the logarithmic renormalizations are large , and to find the scaling properties of the scattering amplitudes , we can restrict our consideration to the energy scales smaller than @xmath32 .",
    "thus when constructing the perturbation series for a tunneling amplitude we will neglect all the processes in which the system visits virtual states with the charge @xmath48 different from 0 or 1 .",
    "another important property of the hamiltonian ( [ tunnel_hamiltonian ] ) is that the perturbation ",
    "the tunneling term  always changes the charge of the dot by 1 .",
    "suppose that at the first step of a high - order tunneling process an electron tunnels from the lead to the dot thus changing @xmath48 from 0 to 1 .",
    "then at the next step an electron will have to tunnel from the dot to the lead ( changing @xmath49 ) , because otherwise a virtual state with @xmath50 and correspondingly large energy @xmath51 would have been created . at the third step an electron tunnels from the lead to the dot , changing @xmath52 , and so on .",
    "one can easily see that exactly the same perturbation series for scattering amplitudes is obtained from the hamiltonian of the anisotropic kondo model , @xmath53 where @xmath54 are the linear combinations of pauli matrices , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 is the impurity spin , @xmath57 .",
    "a formal discussion of this mapping can be found in ref .  ; here we only mention the relations between the parameters of the hamiltonians ( [ tunnel_hamiltonian ] ) and ( [ kondo ] ) .",
    "the values of the electron spin @xmath58 and @xmath59 correspond to the electron being in the lead and the dot respectively .",
    "similarly , the values of the impurity spin @xmath60 and @xmath61 correspond to the states with the number of particles in the dot @xmath45 and 1 .",
    "magnetic field @xmath62 is identified with the energy splitting of the @xmath45 and @xmath46 states , @xmath63 .",
    "finally , the tunneling matrix element @xmath34 is mapped to the exchange constant @xmath64 .",
    "it is well known that at low temperatures and magnetic fields the exchange constant @xmath65 of the kondo model renormalizes logarithmically . as a result @xmath65 grows , and the system approaches the strong - coupling fixed point . in the context of the coulomb blockade problem , this means that at @xmath44 and @xmath20 the tunneling amplitudes grow until the conductance of the barrier becomes of order @xmath2 .    using the analogy with the kondo problem",
    ", one can actually find the renormalizations of the tunneling amplitudes . in the leading logarithm approximation",
    "one can use the poor man s scaling technique.@xcite the result@xcite can be written down in terms of the renormalization of the transmission coefficient @xmath25 of the barrier between the lead and the dot , @xmath66 here @xmath67 is the bare value of the transmission coefficient , and @xmath68 .",
    "when @xmath25 becomes of the order of unity , the leading logarithm approximation fails .",

    "the condition allows only the values of the gate voltage not too close to the resonance , @xmath81 .    as we have seen , if one starts with the weak - tunneling case , in the vicinity of the resonances in @xmath82 the tunneling amplitude grows , and the system approaches the strong - coupling regime .",
    "therefore one can use the results of the weak - tunneling approach to find the universal features of the peaks in conductance which should also persist in the strong - tunneling case .",
    "such features are : ( i ) the @xmath20 value of the peak conductance ( [ peak_conductance ] ) for symmetric barriers is of the order of @xmath2 , and ( ii ) away from the centers of peaks the temperature dependence of the conductance at @xmath20 is @xmath83 .",
