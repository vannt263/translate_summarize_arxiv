    "entanglement or quantum correlations between many space - separated subsystems has been recognized as one of the most intrinsic properties of quantum mechanics and provides the basis for many genuine applications of quantum information theory .",
    "it is , then , quite natural to look for physical situations in which quantum entangled states are obtained .",
    "most of the theoretical and experimental effort has so far been devoted to unveil physical realizations of quantum states describing two quantum correlated subsystems .",
    "the search for physical systems displaying clean three - party entanglement is not simple . in this paper",
    ", we shall analyze decays of particles as a natural scenario for fulfilling such a goal .",
    "more precisely , we shall show that the decay of ortho - positronium into three photons corresponds to a highly entangled state .",
    "let us now review what entanglement can be used for and why it is interesting to look for quantum correlation between more than two particles .",
    "in 1935 einstein , podolsky and rosen @xcite , starting from three reasonable assumptions of locality , reality and completeness that every physical theory must satisfy , argued that quantum mechanics ( qm ) is an incomplete theory .",
    "they did not question quantum mechanics predictions but rather quantum mechanics interpretation @xcite .",
    "their argument was based on some inconsistencies between quantum mechanics and their local - realistic premises ( lr ) which appear for quantum states of bipartite systems , @xmath0 .",
    "it was in 1964 when bell @xcite showed that any theory compatible with lr assumptions can not reproduce some of the statistical predictions of qm , using a gedankenexperiment proposed in @xcite with two quantum correlated spin-@xmath1 particles in the singlet state |s=(|01-|10 ) . in his derivation , as it is well - known , quantum correlations or entanglement have a crucial role .",
    "actually , the singlet state is known to be the maximally entangled state between two particles .",
    "the conflict between lr and qm arises since the latter violates some experimentally verifiable inequalities , called bell inequalities , that any theory according to the local - realistic assumptions ought to satisfy .",
    "it is then possible to design real experiments testing qm against lr ( for a detailed discussion see @xcite ) .",
    "correlations of linear polarizations of pair of photons were measured in 1982 showing strong agreement with quantum mechanichs predictions and violating bell inequalities @xcite .",
    "nowadays , bell inequalities have been tested thoroughly in favor of qm @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been pointed out that some predictions for quantum systems having quantum correlations between more than two particles give a much stronger conflict between lr and qm than any entangled state of two particles .",
    "the maximally entangled state between three spin-@xmath1 particles , the so - called ghz ( greenberger , horne and zeilinger ) state @xcite [ ghzst ]    lr model ( see @xcite and also @xcite for more details ) .",
    "it is then of obvious relevance to obtain these ghz - like correlations .",
    "producing experimentally a ghz state has turned out to be a real challenge yet a controlled instance has been produced in a quantum optics experiment @xcite .",
    "entanglement is then important for our basic understanding of quantum mechanics .",
    "recent developments on quantum information have furthermore shown that it is also a powerful resource for quantum information applications .",
    "for instance , teleportation @xcite uses entanglement in order to obtain surprising results which are impossible in a classical context .",
    "a lot of work has been performed trying to know how entanglement can be quantified and manipulated .",
    "our aim in this paper consists on looking for ghz - like correlations , which are truly three - party pure state entanglement , in the decay of ortho - positronium to three photons .",
    "the choice of this physical system has been motivated mainly by several reasons .",
    "first , decay of particles seems a very natural source of entangled particles .",
    "indeed , positronium decay to two photons was one of the physical systems proposed long time ago as a source of two entangled space - separated particles @xcite . on a different line of thought , some experiments for testing quantum mechanics have been recently proposed using correlated neutral kaons coming from the decay of a @xmath2-meson @xcite . in the case of positronium ,",
    "three entangled photons are obtained in the final state , so it offers the opportunity of analyzing a quantum state showing three - party correlations similar to other experiments in quantum optics .",
    "the structure of the paper goes as follows .",
    "we first review the quantum states emerging in both para- and ortho - positronium decays .",
    "then , we focus on their entanglement properties and proceed to a modern analysis of the three - photon decay state of ortho - positronium . using techniques developed in the context of quantum information theory ,",
    "we show that this state allows in principle for an experimental test of qm finer than the ones based on the use of the singlet state .",
    "we have tried to make the paper self - contained and easy to read for both particle physicists and quantum information physicists .",
    "the first ones can found a translation of some of the quantum information ideas to a well - known situation , that is , the positronium decay to photons , while the second ones can see an application of the very recent techniques obtained for three - party entangled states , which allow to design a qm vs lr test for a three - particle system in a situation different from the ghz state .",
    "let us start reminding some basic facts about positronium .",
    "positronium corresponds to a @xmath3 bound state .",
    "these two spin-@xmath1 particles can form a state with total spin equal to zero , para - positronium ( p - ps ) , or equal to one , ortho - positronium ( o - ps ) . depending on the value of its angular momentum",
    ", it can decay to an even or an odd number of photons as we shall see shortly .",
    "positronium binding energy comes from the coulomb attraction between the electron and the positron . in the non - relativistic limit ,",
    "its wave function is @xcite ( r)=e^-= e^ipr(p)=e^ipr , where @xmath4 , i.e. twice the bohr radius of atomic hydrogen , and @xmath5 is the electron mass . note that the wave function takes significant values only for three - momenta such that @xmath6 , which is consistent with the fact that the system is essentially non - relativistic .",
    "the parity and charge conjugation operators are equal to u_p=(-1)^l+1u_c=(-1)^l+s , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the orbital and spin angular momentum .",
    "positronium states are then classified according to these quantum numbers so that the ground states are @xmath9 , with @xmath10 , for the p - ps and @xmath11 , having @xmath12 , for the o - ps .",
    "positronium is an unstable bound state that can decay to photons .",
    "since a @xmath13-photon state transforms as @xmath14 under charge conjugation , which is an exact discrete symmetry for any qed process such as the decay of positronium , we have that the ground state of p - ps ( o - ps ) decays to an even ( odd ) number of photons @xcite",
    ". the analysis of the decay of positronium to photons can be found in a standard qed textbook @xcite .",
    "para - positronium lifetime is about 0.125 ns , while for the case of ortho - positronium the lifetime is equal to approximately 0.14 @xmath15s @xcite .",
    "the computation of positronium decays is greatly simplified due to the following argument .",
    "the scale which controls the structure of positronium is of the order of @xmath16 . on the other hand ,",
    "the scale for postrinomium annihilation is of the order of @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , it is easy to prove that positronium decays are only sensitive to the value of the wave function at the origin . as a consequence",
    ", it is possible to factor out the value of the wave function from the tree - level qed final state computation @xcite . a simple computation of feymann diagrams will be enough to write the precise structure of momenta and polarizations which describe the positronium decays .",
    "furthermore , only tree - level amplitudes need to be computed since higher corrections are suppressed by one power of @xmath17 .",
    "let us now proceed to analyze the decays of p - ps and o - ps in turn .",
    "para - positronium ground state decays into two photons .",
    "because of the argument mentioned above , the determination of the two - photon state coming from the p - ps decay is simply given by the lowest order feynmann diagram of @xmath18 .",
    "since positronium is a non - relativistic particle to a very good approximation , the three - momenta of @xmath19 and @xmath20 are taken equal to zero , and the corresponding spinors are replaced by a two - component spin .",
    "this implies that the tree - level calculation of the annihilation of p - ps into two photons is equal to , up to constants , [ ampl ] m(e^+e^-)~^c_+m_2_- , where ( see @xcite for more details ) @xmath21 is the two - component spinor describing the fermions , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 gives m_2=_perm(_1^*_2^*)ki_22 a(k_1,_1;k_2,_2)i_22 , where @xmath24 stands for the circular polarization vector associated to the outgoing photon @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the @xmath27 identity matrix .",
    "more precisely , for a photon having the three - momentum vector @xmath28 , the polarization vectors can be chosen @xmath29 where @xmath30 and they obey @xmath31 from the expressions of the polarizaton vectors and the three - momentum and energy conservation , it follows that the scalar term @xmath32 is a(k,_1;-k,_2)=-(_1+_2 ) , and it verifies [ scalar ] & & a(k,+1;-k,+1)=-a(k,-1;-k,-1 ) + & & a(k,+1;-k,-1)=-a(k,+1;-k,-1)=0 .",
    "the two fermions in the para - positonium ground state are in the singlet state , @xmath33@xmath34@xmath35@xmath34@xmath36 , and then , using the previous relations for @xmath32 and ( [ ampl ] ) , the two - photon state resulting of the p - ps desintegration is [ p - psdes ]    equivalent to a maximally entangled state of two spin-@xmath1 particles .",
    "this is a well - known result and was , actually , one of the physical system first proposed as a source of particles having the quantum correlations needed to test qm vs lr @xcite .",
    "the ground state of ortho - positronium has @xmath12 and , due to the fact that charge conjugation is conserved , decays to three photons . repeating the treatment performed for the p - ps annihilation",
    ", the determination of the three - photon state resulting from the o - ps decay requires the simple calculation of the tree - level feynmann diagrams corresponding to @xmath37 .",
    "its tree - level computation gives , up to constants , [ ampl3 ] m(e^+e^-)~^c_+m_3_- , and the @xmath27 matrix @xmath38 is equal to @xcite m_3=_cyclicperm .",
    "( ( ^*_2 ^*_3-_2 _ 3 ) ^*_1 + ( ^*_2_3 + ^*_3_2 ) _ 1 ) , where @xmath39 using ( [ epsprop ] ) we can rewrite @xmath38 in the following way @xmath40 where @xmath41 notice that the helicity coefficient @xmath42 for the cyclic permutations of @xmath43 explicitly enforces the vanishing of the @xmath44 and @xmath45 polarizations , @xmath46 on the other hand , the rest of structures are different from zero @xmath47 and similar expressions for the other cyclic terms .    the original @xmath3 in the ortho - positronium could be in any of the three triplet states .",
    "it can be shown , using ( [ ampl3 ] ) and ( [ amplvec ] ) , that when the initial positronium state is @xmath33@xmath34@xmath48@xmath34@xmath49 , the decay amplitude is proportional to @xmath50 , while the same argument gives @xmath51 for @xmath33@xmath34@xmath48@xmath34@xmath52 and @xmath53 for @xmath33@xmath34@xmath48@xmath34@xmath54 .",
    "now , considering the explicit expressions of the polarization vectors ( [ epsilon ] ) , with @xmath55 without loss of generality , and ( [ nzterms ] ) , it is easy to see that the three - photon state coming from the o - ps decay is , up to normalization , [ finst ] |_0(k_1,k_2,k_3)= & & ( 1-k_1k_2)(|++-+|+ ) + + & & ( 1-k_1k_3)(|+-++|-+- ) + + & & ( 1-k_2k_3)(|-+++|+ ) , when the third component of the ortho - positronium spin , @xmath56 , is equal to zero , and [ finst2 ] |_1(k_1,k_2,k_3)= & & ( 1-k_1k_2)(|++--|+ ) + + & & ( 1-k_1k_3)(|+-+-|-+- ) + + & & ( 1-k_2k_3)(|-++-|+ ) , when @xmath57 .",
    "the final state of the o - ps decay is , thus , an entangled state of three photons , whose quantum correlations depend on the angles among the momenta of the outgoing three photons . for the rest of the paper we will consider the first family of states ( @xmath58 ) although equivalent conclusions are valid for the second one . in the next sections we will analyze the entanglement properties of the states @xmath59 , using some of the quantum information techniques and comparing them to the well - known cases of the singlet and ghz state",
    "the quantum correlations of the three - photon entangled state obtained from the o - ps annihilation depend on the position of the photon detectors , i.e. on the photon directions we are going to measure .",
    "our next aim will be to choose from the family of states given by ( [ finst ] ) the one that , in some sense , has the maximum amount of ghz - like correlations . in order to do this ,",
    "we first need to introduce some recent results on the study of three - party entanglement .",
    "the set of states @xmath60 form a six - parameter dependent family in the hilbert space @xmath61 , so that each of its components is equivalent to a state describing three spin-@xmath1 particles or three qubits ( a qubit , or quantum bit , is the quantum version of the classical bit and corresponds to a spin-@xmath1 particle ) .",
    "two pure states belonging to a generic composite system @xmath62 , i.e. @xmath63 parties each having a @xmath64-dimensional hilbert space , are equivalent as far as their entanglement properties go when they can be transformed one into another by local unitary transformations .",
    "this argument gives a lower bound for the entanglement parameters a generic state @xmath65 depends on . since the number of real parameters for describing it is @xmath66 , and the action of an element of the group of local unitary transformations @xmath67 is equivalent to the action of @xmath68 , which depends on @xmath69 real parameters , the number of entanglement parameters is bounded by @xmath70 . for our case",
    "this counting of entanglement parameters gives six , since we have @xmath71 , and it can be proved that this is indeed the number of nonlocal parameters describing a state in @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "the above arguments imply that six independent quantities invariant under the action of the group of local unitary transformations will be enough , up to some discrete symmetry , to describe the entanglement properties of any three - qubit pure state . given a generic state @xmath72 [ genst ] |=_i , j , k t_ijk|ijki",
    ", j , k=1,2 , where @xmath73 are the elements of a basis in each subsystem , a , b and c , the application of three local unitary transformations @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 transforms the coefficients @xmath77 into t_ijk=u_i^au_j^bu_k^ct _ . from this expression",
    "it is not difficult to build polynomial combinations of the coefficient @xmath77 which are invariant under local unitary transformations @xcite .",
    "these quantities are good candidates for being an entanglement parameter .",
    "for example , one of these invariants is t_i_1j_1k_1t_i_1j_2k_2^t_i_2j_2k_2t_i_2j_1k_1^=tr(_a^2 ) , where @xmath78 is the density matrix describing the local quantum state of a ( and the same happens for b and c ) .",
    "in @xcite the six linearly independent polynomial invariants of minor degree were found ( a trivial one is the norm ) and a slightly modified version of these quantities was also proposed in @xcite . in the rest of the paper",
    "we will not consider the norm , so the space of entanglement parameters of the normalized states belonging to @xmath61 has dimension equal to five .",
    "a particularly relevant polynomial invariant is the so - called tangle , @xmath79 , introduced in @xcite .",
    "there is strong evidence that somehow it is a measure of the amount of `` ghz - ness '' of a state @xcite .",
    "it corresponds to the modulus of the hyperdeterminant of the hypermatrix given by the coefficients @xmath77 @xcite , which from ( [ genst ] ) corresponds to [ tangle ] ( |)=|hdet(t_ijk)|=|_i_1i_2 _ i_3i_4 _ j_1j_2 _ j_3j_4 _ k_1k_3 _ k_2k_4t_i_1j_1k_1t_i_2j_2k_2t_i_3j_3k_3t_i_4j_4k_4| , where @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "this quantity can be shown to be symmetric under permutation of the indices @xmath82 .",
    "because of the interpretation of the tangle as a measure of the ghz - like correlations , we will choose the position of the photon detectors , from the set of states ( [ finst ] ) , the ones that are associated to a maximum tangle .",
    "in the figure [ tangledet ] it is shown the variation of the tangle with the position of the detectors .",
    "it is not difficult to see that the state of ( [ finst ] ) with maximum tangle corresponds to the case @xmath83 , i.e. the most symmetric configuration , that we shall call `` mercedes - star '' geometry .",
    "the normalized state obtained from ( [ finst ] ) for this geometry is [ state ] |=(|++-+|++|+-++|-+-+|-+++|+ ) .",
    "note that the ghz state has tangle equal to @xmath84 , while the value of the tangle of ( [ state ] ) is lower , [ stangle ] ( |)= .",
    "it is arguable that a `` mercedes - star '' geometry was naturally expected to produce a maximum tangle state .",
    "indeed , ghz - like quantum correlations do not singularize any particular qubit .",
    "let us also mention that the state we have singled out has some nice properties from the point of view of group theory .",
    "it does correspond to the sum of two of the elements of the coupled basis resulting from the tensor product of three spin-@xmath1 particles , @xmath85 , @xcite"
