    "casimir forces are usually attractive interactions measurable at small separations , but recent theoretical works  @xcite have predicted a variety of situations in which these forces can be modified by using complex microstructures .",
    "in addition , by utilizing different choices of materials the casimir force can be changed in both magnitude  @xcite and sign  @xcite . however , with some exceptions  @xcite , the qualitative aspects of these effects can be explained through a combination or competition of forces calculated using some form of the proximity force approximation ( pfa , a common heuristic description of the casimir force as pairwise interactions between parallel surface patches )  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of interest to consider situations in which geometry not only allows the casimir force to be modulated ( e.g. , by reducing or changing the sign of the force ) , but also creates effects that can not be accounted for by pfa .    in this article ,",
    "we introduce and examine a geometry that exhibits both of these qualities .",
    "we examine the configuration shown in  fig .",
    "[ fig : config ] , consisting of two identical microstructured slabs consisting of periodic arrays of dielectric nanowires .",
    "we compute the exact casimir force for this geometry using a combination of existing scattering theory techniques  @xcite , to be described below .",
    "we find that the microstructure of the slabs leads to a number of interesting qualitative effects : the force between the slabs can be dramatically modulated by rotating the two slabs at fixed surface - surface separation . in vacuum ,",
    "the force between the slabs can be significantly reduced ( more than halved as the rotation angle changes ) , and if the slabs are immersed in a fluid , the sign of the force can flip .",
    "it turns out that , even at moderate separations @xmath0 , pfa ( an uncontrolled approximation ) can not capture either of these effects .",
    "specifically , consider the behavior of the casimir force between the slabs as they undergo lateral translations @xmath1 ( at @xmath2 the slabs are mirror - symmetric ) and rotations @xmath3 . at @xmath4 ,",
    "the slab microstructures are aligned as in  fig .",
    "[ fig : config ] ( upper ) , while for @xmath5 the slabs are crossed , as in  fig .",
    "[ fig : config ] ( lower ) . as @xmath1 and @xmath3",
    "are varied , the slab surface - surface separation @xmath6 is kept fixed . from a simple geometric argument , it is clear that for vacuum - separated wires pfa predicts the following bound on the casimir force between two identical slabs : @xmath7 ( a positive force is attractive ) . here",
    "@xmath8 denotes the force when @xmath9 .",
    "this bound is insensitive to the details of the exact pfa used , and simply relies on the fact that the wire surface - surface separations are minimized at @xmath10 and maximized when @xmath11 .",
    "although a pfa prediction must be valid as @xmath12 , for the systems examined in this work we find that the bound  eq .",
    "( [ eq : intro_bound ] ) is violated even at moderate distances @xmath0 . for vacuum - separated metallic / dielectric ( e.g. , gold or silica ) nanowires and",
    "no substrate , this implies that changing the orientation of the wire arrays ( i.e. , their geometry ) plays a stronger role in reducing the force than simply reducing the pairwise surface - surface separation between the slabs . in another case to be discussed , in which the wires are gold , the substrate silica , and the fluid ethanol , the bound  eq .",
    "( [ eq : intro_bound ] ) is also valid .",
    "however , we find from exact calculation that while pfa predicts @xmath13 and @xmath14 , the opposite is in fact true , i.e. , aligned slabs are always attracted to each other , while crossed slabs are _ repelled_. therefore , in our case at @xmath15 the sign of the force can therefore be modulated by rotating the slabs ( but not translating them ) , an interesting possibility for experiments that we discuss later .",
    "to understand these effects qualitatively , we find that a much more suitable framework is the effective medium approximation ( ema ) , in which the microstructured slabs of  fig .",
    "[ fig : config ] are describable as an homogeneous medium with a given anisotropic permittivity tensor @xmath16 ( here and below , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 will be used to denote effective , homogenized permittivities ) .",
    "we are able to compute the effective @xmath20 tensor for this configuration from our scattering method  @xcite , and we find that for the gold - silica - ethanol configuration , the deduced effective - medium parameters follow an ascending sequence @xmath21 . this ascending sequence is known to lead to repulsion  @xcite for uniform , isotropic materials , and we find below that the effect is also present for anisotropic materials and individual polarizations ( although in this case , as discussed below , an ascending sequence is not sufficient for repulsion ) .",
    "one expects the ema to be strictly valid as @xmath22 , however in our case it turns out , somewhat surprisingly , to be qualitatively accurate down to @xmath23 ( a mathematical proof of why the ema holds at such short separations , at least for crossed slabs , is given in  appendix  [ sec : appb ] ) .",
    "further , we find that for realistic materials ( gold wires , silica substrate , immersed in an ethanol fluid ) and geometry parameters , this orientation induced repulsion at fixed surface - surface separation between the two slabs holds down to separations @xmath24 .",
    "previous works  @xcite have discussed the possibility of using geometry to create artificial constitutive relations ( e.g. , effective permeability @xmath25 to obtain casimir repulsion or chirality @xmath26 to achieve force reduction ) . however , it has been rigorously proven  @xcite that no such media with @xmath27 can be constructed from metallic / dielectric constituents so as to exhibit repulsion in vacuum , and computations involving the exact microstructures  @xcite have shown that chirality effects are only present at separations so large that they can not conceivably be detected . therefore , while in some circumstances ema can be a useful qualitative guide ( and rigorously accurate in certain limits ) , it must be used with caution  ideally , as a supplement to exact calculations .",
    "orientation dependence ( and the resulting casimir torque ) between slabs has previously been considered for two birefringent plates with weak anisotropy  @xcite , and for corrugated metallic plates  @xcite .",
    "although the torques in these systems are in principle measurable , the change in the force with orientation is small , and the forces are always attractive .",
    "ref .   showed a large orientation dependence for theoretical uniaxial conductors , and suggested a possible realization via nanowire arrays , but without calculation in the latter case and without changing the sign of the force .    in the present work ,",
    "we analyze this effect for periodically - patterned , vacuum - separated suspended membranes ( which form a potentially promising medium for casimir force measurements  @xcite ) and for gold wires on silica substrate , immersed in ethanol . in both cases ,",
    "we find  eq .  ( [ eq : intro_bound ] ) is violated down to @xmath0 .",
    "in the former case , we find that the force is @xmath28 lower for crossed slabs compared to aligned slabs ( for any @xmath1 ) at large separations , while at separations comparable to the unit cell ( e.g. , @xmath29 ) there is a more modest , but still significant , @xmath30 reduction . for the latter system",
    ", we find that aligned slabs are attractive for all @xmath1 down to @xmath24 while crossed slabs are repulsive in this range . these examples",
    "demonstrate a system in which effective - medium theory is correct and gives predictions that differ from pfa in a highly nontrivial way . given that nanowire arrays below @xmath31 can be fabricated with current technology  @xcite and that for these dimensions the predicted effects occur down to sub-@xmath29 length - scales , these effects",
    "should be experimentally accessible .",
    "after presenting these results , we argue how they may be experimentally detectable ( assuming suitable fabrication techniques ) and estimate force magnitudes in the hypothetical case where one of the slabs is replaced by either a sphere or cylinder with a wire pattern stamped on its surface .",
    "in this work , we perform casimir force calculations with a semi - analytic scattering method using a combination of results from ref .  , which efficiently computes the exact casimir force between periodic arrays with one dimensional of translation - invariance .",
    "our implementation differs somewhat from previous scattering methods ( e.g. ,  refs .  ) in that it is particularly well - suited to unit cells with objects of compact cross - section , such as the wires in  fig .",
    "[ fig : config ] ( rather than , e.g. , extended rectangular gratings ) .",
    "while we are primarily interested in objects of circular cross - section in the current work , the present method can be extended in a straightforward manner to treat unit cells with arbitrarily shaped compact objects using an existing boundary - element method  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we have checked the results with a brute - force finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd )  @xcite method and found good agreement , and additionally these computations show similar results for square wires . also , the effects are not significantly different at zero temperature and 300 k , so we work exclusively in the former limit .    the two plates are separated from each other by a distance @xmath6 in the @xmath32 direction , and the slab is termed @xmath1-directed if the wires are along the @xmath1 axis ( similarly for @xmath33 ) .",
    "the slabs are aligned if both slabs are @xmath1- or @xmath33-directed , and crossed if they are not .",
    "the zero - temperature casimir interaction energy for a @xmath34-directed slab displaced by @xmath35 from a @xmath36 directed slab ( @xmath37 ) is : @xmath38 where @xmath39 are the scattering matrices of planewaves for the two slabs , @xmath40 is the planewave translation matrix for relative displacement @xmath35 between the slabs , and the integral of transverse wavevector components @xmath41 is over the first brillouin zone .",
    "see  ref .   for a detailed derivation and a partial review of precursors  @xcite . for the present work ,",
    "we require an efficient method of computing the scattering matrices from periodic arrays , which we describe in more detail in  appendix  [ sec : method - scattering ] .    for sufficiently large distances ,",
    "the relevant frequencies and wave - vectors are unable to probe the structure of the arrays and consequently an effective medium approximation should produce good results . in our case , such an effective medium should have a much larger conductivity in the direction of the wires as compared to the other orthogonal directions even in the static limit ( this being one of the motivations for the current configuration ) , so it is clear that an anisotropic ema is called for .",
    "fortunately , casimir interactions between anisotropic homogeneous media have been studied by several authors  @xcite , allowing us to build upon their results .",
    "we use the method of  ref .",
    "( outlined in  appendix  [ sec : method - ema ] ) to obtain the scattering matrices assuming a known permittivity @xmath17 . in the subsequent analysis , we also require the inverse procedure : given the scattering matrices ( computed using the method of  appendix  [ sec : method - scattering ] ) of the exact structure , retrieve the best - fit ema @xmath17 .",
    "this procedure quickly becomes intractable if arbitrary @xmath17 and @xmath42 are allowed .",
    "instead , we assume @xmath43 and @xmath44 exhibit no dependence on @xmath45 aside from its polarization . for @xmath46 the scattering matrices for each polarization reduce to the standard fresnel formula for reflection off isotropic interfaces .",
    "their inversion then yields the effective dielectric tensor :    @xmath47",
    "in the configuration of  fig .  [ fig : config ] , the wires have radius @xmath48 and period @xmath49 ; we take the wire centers to be in the substrate and the wire surface to be tangent to the substrate surface to maximize the wire - wire interactions .",
    "the permittivities of wires , substrate , and fluid are respectively @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 for imaginary frequency @xmath53 .",
    "the materials used for the wires , substrate , and fluid are gold , ethanol , and silica , respectively . for gold ,",
    "we use a plasma model with @xmath54 ( the addition of a small loss term does not change the results significantly ) . for silica and ethanol",
    "we use standard oscillator models  @xcite .",
    "we first compute the casimir forces when the intervening medium is vacuum ( @xmath55 ) , comparing the force @xmath56 for aligned slabs with the force @xmath8 for crossed slabs . in the aligned case ,",
    "the force can depend on @xmath1 ( leading to a lateral component of the force ) , and in this case @xmath57 refers only to the _ normal _ component of this force . in the crossed case @xmath58",
    "there is no @xmath1-dependence .",
    "although there is no sign change for vacuum - separated slabs , this configuration is of interest because it can be fabricated as a single suspended - membrane structure for each orientation  @xcite , and may be easier to work with than a fluid system .",
    "figure  [ fig : results - vac ] shows results for wires composed of perfect metal , gold , and heavily doped silicon , the latter being more conventional for fabrication .",
    "we plot the ratio @xmath59 ( the shaded regions indicate the full range of this ratio as @xmath1 is varied ) , which serves two purposes . first , it indicates the required relative accuracy in a force measurement needed to discern the orientation - dependence of the force in an experiment .",
    "second , it indicates the transition from the pfa to the ema regimes via  eq .",
    "( [ eq : intro_bound ] ) : if the force is determined as a sum of pairwise interactions , then the total force is maximized when the pairwise surface - surface distances are minimized .",
    "a simple geometric argument shows that the net distance is maximized for @xmath11 . on the other hand , this distance is minimized for @xmath10 .",
    "the bound  eq .",
    "( [ eq : intro_bound ] ) then follows .",
    "it turns out that the force is always attractive in this situation , so we have the further bound @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , pfa predicts that there is a range of @xmath1 such that @xmath61 .",
    "by contrast , ema predicts the inequality @xmath62 ( there is no @xmath1-dependence in this approximation ) .",
    "this inequality stems from the following scattering - theory argument : for @xmath63 , the exponential suppression of @xmath64 in @xmath65  @xcite implies that the force is dominated by the scattering of planewaves at normal incidence ( @xmath66 ) . for normal incidence ,",
    "the reflection matrix @xmath67 is anisotropic but diagonal in polarization , and can be computed from an effective anisotropic dielectric tensor : @xmath68 : @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the matrix elements for incident light polarized parallel and perpendicular , respectively , to the wires . for normal incidence ,",
    "@xmath72 does not contribute , and we define @xmath73 and @xmath74 . due to the high permittivity of the wires and the low permittivity of the substrate , we expect @xmath75 and @xmath76 [ note that @xmath77 is real ] . when the wires are aligned , the relevant product of scattering matrices in the energy integrand is @xmath78 , and when they are crossed the term is @xmath79 , implying @xmath80 . from  fig .",
    "[ fig : results - vac ] , this bound is clearly violated in doped si for @xmath81 , and for other materials at smaller @xmath6 .",
    "note that this includes a region @xmath82 for which there is still a strong @xmath1-dependence of this ratio , indicating that while ema is not strictly valid , it still has more predictive power than pfa .    as @xmath83 , the force ratios should approach a constant determined by @xmath84 : this ratio is @xmath85 for all three materials .",
    "however , this limit is approached very slowly ( @xmath86 for perfect metal / gold wires ) .",
    "the ema @xmath6-dependence is due both to constituent material dispersion and an effective geometric dispersion in @xmath68 induced by the geometry of the wires . as @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the former limit follows from the @xmath90 divergence of @xmath91 as @xmath87 ( if we add a dissipative term to @xmath91 , the divergence is only @xmath92 but this crossover occurs at frequencies too low to affect the present results ) .",
    "the latter limit follows from the fact that the static polarizability of the wires in the transverse direction is finite , implying that their contribution to the scattering amplitude vanishes as @xmath93 .",
    "therefore , as @xmath87 , @xmath19 depends only on the substrate , which has semi - infinite extent ; we have checked this relation numerically and found good agreement .",
    "@xmath94 can then be obtained by computing the force between two anisotropic plates , with @xmath95 and @xmath96 .    for all @xmath97 ,",
    "the orientation - dependence of the force is quite strong ( @xmath98 ) . in this range ,",
    "the absolute pressure is approximately @xmath99 of the corresponding pressure between two homogeneous perfect metal plates . as differences of this magnitude between vacuum - separated plates",
    "have been measured on the @xmath100 length scale , we are hopeful that this departure from pfa can be detected experimentally .     over aligned wires @xmath101 between vacuum - separated nanowires of perfect metal , gold , and doped silicon ( dopant density @xmath102 ) .",
    "@xmath103 corresponds to using non - dispersive @xmath104 for all materials ( because @xmath53 is in units of @xmath105 ) .",
    "shaded regions indicate the range of values that @xmath57 takes over all relative lateral displacements @xmath1 of the wire centers , with their higher ( lower ) boundary indicating the force for @xmath106 ( @xmath107 .",
    "pfa predicts , via  eq .",
    "( [ eq : intro_bound ] ) , that the maximum of this ratio should exceed 1 , which is only true for si at @xmath108 , and for gold / perfect metal at lower separations .",
    "inset : details of the configuration examined . ]      in the previous example the force is always attractive , because @xmath109 for all @xmath53  @xcite .",
    "however , if the medium between the slabs is a fluid such that @xmath110 , the above ema analysis predicts that the force in the crossed configuration should be repulsive as @xmath111 since by the fresnel formula at @xmath112 , @xmath113 , leading to the well - known casimir repulsion for an ascending sequence of @xmath20 for each polarization  @xcite .",
    "by contrast , in the aligned configuration the force is attractive when @xmath2 due to mirror symmetry  @xcite , and the intuition that this attraction holds for non - zero @xmath1 is confirmed by calculation . however , strong corrections to this argument occur at finite separations : waves with nonzero @xmath114 and @xmath115 contribute , and are not in general polarized along the @xmath1 or @xmath33 axes .",
    "these waves will couple to both @xmath18 and @xmath19 on each reflection .",
    "the sign of the resultant reflection coefficient will usually be the same for both @xmath33- and @xmath1-directed slabs , leading to attractive contributions .",
    "further , the microstructure can also lead to significant corrections , possibly eliminating the effect for separations comparable to the unit cell @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "as such separations are necessarily required for experiments , we require exact results to verify that this effect persists in experimentally accessible regions .",
    "the exact results are shown in  fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] ; as in  fig .  [",
    "fig : results - vac ] , shaded regions show the @xmath1-dependence .",
    "the results show a clear attractive - repulsive transition as the slab orientation is varied between the aligned and crossed configurations .",
    "this effect persists for both the ideal case of perfect metals @xmath116 and dispersive materials at @xmath117 ; both show qualitatively similar behavior . for crossed slabs ,",
    "the repulsion is fairly flat over a @xmath118 range . at first sight , it is temping to ascribe the repulsive force observed for crossed wires to pfa - line interactions between opposing areas where metallic wires face dielectric substrate and thus feel a repulsive force .",
    "however , if this were the case , then by the same argument ( and  eq .",
    "( [ eq : intro_bound ] ) ) , @xmath119 should exhibit an even stronger repulsion .",
    "this is clearly not the case in  fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] for @xmath120 ; rather , the results for repulsion are consistent with the ema argument given above .",
    "to estimate the magnitude of this repulsion , for @xmath117 the repulsive pressure is approximately @xmath121 of the pressure between parallel perfectly - conducting plates separated by a comparable distance @xmath6 in vacuum , e.g , @xmath122 .",
    "repulsive forces in fluids on this order of magnitude have been measured  @xcite , therefore these forces are potentially within reach of current or near - future measurement techniques ( the force in more realistic sphere - plate and cylinder - plate geometries will be considered in  sec .  [",
    "sec : geometries ] below ) .",
    "interestingly , when the wires are crossed and @xmath6 varies there is an attractive - repulsive transition at a critical separation @xmath123 .",
    "this leads to an unstable equilibrium with respect to @xmath6 .",
    "( the crossed configuration is always unstable with respect to orientation . )",
    "this transition , as mentioned above , is attributed to the eventual dominance of attractive forces as separation goes to zero .",
    "however , we will see below that such a transition is predicted by ema as well , and is therefore not due entirely to proximity effects .",
