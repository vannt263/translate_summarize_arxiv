    "in an earlier paper @xcite , hereafter referred to as i , we have explored the lhc implications of imposing @xmath0 quasi - yukawa unification ( qyu ) at the grand unification scale ( @xmath12 gev ) .",
    "this modified approach to the third family ( @xmath0 ) yu @xcite can be motivated by the desire to construct realistic supersymmetric models of grand unified theories ( guts ) which also incorporate realistic masses and mixings observed in the matter sector .",
    "for instance , the desired quarks and charged lepton masses for the second family fermion can be incorporated , following @xcite , by including higgs fields in the ( 15,1,3 ) representation of @xmath1 ( 4 - 2 - 2 ) @xcite , which develop a non - zero gut scale vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) .",
    "the third family yukawa couplings receive , in this case , sizable new contributions , and the deviations from exact yu can be stated as follows @xcite :    @xmath13    where @xmath2 measures the deviation from the exact yu . restricting the deviation to @xmath14",
    "we refer eq.([qyu ] ) to qyu condition .",
    "the 4 - 2 - 2 model has many salient features distinguishing it from other high scale theories @xcite .",
    "the discrete left - right ( lr ) symmetry reduces the number of gauge couplings from three to two with @xmath15 .",
    "it also requires gaugino masses of @xmath16 and @xmath17 to be equal at @xmath4 .",
    "the matter fields of each family belong to @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the lr symmetry requires the existence of right handed neutrino .    in this paper",
    "we reconsider qyu in the framework of 4 - 2 - 2 defined above , taking into account the fact that the mssm gaugino masses @xmath20 at @xmath4 can be non - universal .",
    "in particular , we assume the following asymptotic relation @xcite    @xmath21    which follows from the assumption of left - right symmetry at @xmath4 and the fact that @xmath22 derived from 4 - 2 - 2 is given as follows ;    @xmath23    here @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the asymptotic gaugino masses for @xmath22 , @xmath16 and @xmath27 , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are diagonal generators of @xmath17 and @xmath30 respectively .",
    "the setup of our paper is as follows . in section [ sec : scan ] we briefly explain our scanning procedure and list the experimental constraints that we impose on the data obtained from our scans . in section [ sec : spec ]",
    "we show the fundamental parameter space that is allowed by the experimental constraints and qyu .",
    "section [ sec : coan ] provides the implications for dark matter sector such as coannihilation channels and the resonance solution .",
    "section [ sec : higgsinodm ] considers a higgsino - like lsp and emphasize the implications for direct detection experiments .",
    "section [ sec : isasoft ] compares the isajet and softsusy , and the small variations in their phenomenology .",
    "we also present the benchmark points obtained from the different scans to exemplify our results .",
    "finally , we conclude our study in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in our scan , we employ isajet 7.84 @xcite , softsusy-3.4.1 @xcite and superiso relic v3.3 @xcite to calculate the low scale observables .",
    "the gauge and yukawa couplings are first estimated at the low scale .",
    "isajet evolves the gauge couplings and the yukawa couplings of the third family up to @xmath4 , while softsusy performs the calculations in the three family approximation in evolution of yukawa couplings .",
    "we do not strictly enforce the gauge unification condition @xmath31 , since a few percent deviation from the gauge coupling unification can be generated by unknown gut - scale threshold corrections @xcite .",
    "hence , @xmath4 is calculated to be the scale where @xmath32 and @xmath33 deviates a few percent .",
    "after @xmath4 is determined , the soft supersymmetry breaking ( ssb ) parameters determined with the boundary conditions defined at @xmath4 are evolved together with the gauge and yukawa couplings from @xmath4 to the weak scale @xmath34 .",
    "the susy threshold corrections to the yukawa couplings @xcite are taken into account at the common scale @xmath35 in isajet , while softsusy evaluates them at the electroweak scale .",
    "the entire parameter set is iteratively run between @xmath36 and @xmath4 using full 2-loop rges , and the ssb parameters are extracted from rges at the appropriate scales @xmath37 .",
    "we have performed random scans over the following parameter space :    @xmath38    taking eq.[gaugino422 ] into account .",
    "we use the @xmath39 notation in which @xmath40 is the universal ssb mass term for the particles , and @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 are ssb mass terms for the gauginos of @xmath22 , @xmath16 and @xmath27 respectively , @xmath41 is the universal ssb term for trilinear scalar interactions , @xmath42 is the ratio of vevs of the mssm higgs doublets , @xmath43 is coefficient of the bilinear higgs mixing term , and @xmath44 is the top quark mass . note that we set the top quark mass to 173.3 gev @xcite , and our results are not too sensitive to a @xmath45 variation in @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "we employ the metropolis - hasting algorithm as described in @xcite , and require all collected points to satisfy radiative electroweak symmetry breaking ( rewsb ) with lsp neutralino .",
    "the rewsb gives a crucial theoretical constraint on the parameter space @xcite .",
    "after collecting data , we impose constraints from the mass bounds @xcite , rare decays of b - meson such as @xmath46 @xcite , @xmath47 @xcite , and @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "after obtaining the region allowed by the lhc constraints , we also apply the wmap bound @xcite on the relic abundance of lsp neutralino .",
    "isajet interfaces with isatools @xcite for b - physics and relic density observables , while we interface softsusy with superiso relic in order to calculate these observables .",
    "the experimental constraints imposed in our data can be summarized as follows :    @xmath49    we emphasize here the mass bounds on the higgs boson @xcite and gluino @xcite .",
    "we allow a few percent deviation from the observed mass of the higgs boson , since there exist about a 2 gev error in estimation of its mass arising due to theoretical uncertainties in the calculation of the minimum of the scalar potential , and experimental uncertainties in @xmath44 and @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "besides these constraints , we require our solutions to do no worse than the sm in comparing predictions for the muon anomalous magnetic moment . note that we relax the wmap bound to @xmath51 on the solutions obtained from superiso relic in order to take into account uncertainties in the calculation of the relic abundance of lsp neutralino .",

    "isajet and softsusy are in good agreement regarding results of the mass spectrum .",
    "in the previous section we have focused on the fundamental parameter space and the mass spectrum of the colored particles .",
    "since we accept only those solutions which lead to lsp neutralino , it is worth investigating the implications of 4 - 2 - 2 on the dark matter observables . indeed ,",
    "if the lsp neutralino is mostly a bino , its relic abundance is usually so high that it can not be consistent with the wmap observation .",
    "however , one can identify various coannihilation channels that reduce the relic abundance of neutralino to the desired ranges .",
    "4 - 2 - 2 has some rich phenomenological implications and allows various coannihilation channel scenarios at the low scale @xcite , since it allows asymptotically different masses for the gauginos as given in eq.([gaugino422 ] ) . on the other hand ,",

    "in contrast to earlier studies , the mssm gaugino masses at @xmath4 are non - universal but consistent with the gauge symmetry @xmath6 . the thermal relic abundance of the lsp neutralino is compatible with the wmap bounds through the chargino and stau coannihilation channels , as well as the a - resonance solution .",

    "<S> we explore the dark matter and lhc implications of @xmath0 quasi yukawa unification in the framework of supersymmetric models based on the gauge symmetry @xmath1 . the deviation from exact yukawa unification is quantified by a dimensionless parameter @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , such that the yukawa couplings at @xmath4 are related by @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to earlier studies which focused on universal gaugino masses , we consider non - universal gaugino masses at @xmath4 that are compatible with the gauge symmetry @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we perform two independent scans of the fundamental parameter space , one of which employs isajet , while the other uses softsusy interfaced with superiso . </S>",
    "<S> these scans reveal qualitatively similar allowed regions in the parameter space , and yield a variety of neutralino dark matter scenarios consistent with the observations . </S>",
    "<S> these include stau and chargino coannihilation scenarios , the @xmath7resonance scenario , as well as higgsino dark matter solution which is more readily probed by direct detection searches . </S>",
    "<S> the gluino mass is found to be @xmath8 tev , the stop mass is @xmath9 tev , while the first two family squarks and sleptons are of order @xmath10 tev and @xmath11 tev respectively . </S>"
