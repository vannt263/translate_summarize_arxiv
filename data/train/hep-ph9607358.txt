    "the bhabha scattering process consists in fact of two distinct processes ( especially at the z peak ) : one is the small angle bhabha ( sabh ) process below about @xmath1 in the scattering angle , which is dominated by the gamma @xmath2-channel exchange and another one , the large angle bhabha ( labh ) process above @xmath1 , which gets important contributions from various @xmath3-channel ( annihilation ) exchanges .",
    "the sabh process is employed almost exclusively to determine the luminosity in the @xmath4 colliders , using dedicated luminometer sub - detectors .",
    "the labh provides input data for precision electroweak tests of the standard model ( sm ) , in particular the electron partial width @xmath5 of the z boson . in this presentation",
    "we shall concentrate mainly on the sabh process . at lep at @xmath6 , in the @xmath7@xmath8 angular range",
    "it gives about four times more events than z decays .",
    "it is therefore ideally suited for precise measurements of the luminosity from the point of view of statistical error .",
    "even more important , it is dominated by `` known physics '' , that is by @xmath2-channel exchange of a photon  it is therefore calculable from `` first principles '' , i.e. from the lagrangian of the quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) with the standard quantum field theory methods , feynman diagrams , etc .      at present , the luminosity measurement at lep using the sabh process has a very small statistical and experimental systematic error , typically @xmath9 .",
    "the uncertainty of the theoretical calculation of the sabh process has to be combined with this error .",
    "it is called the `` theoretical error '' ( the theory uncertainty ) of the luminosity .",
    "it was last year reduced to @xmath10 @xcite and is now at the level of @xmath11 @xcite : in spite of the progress , it is still a dominant component of the total luminosity error .",
    "this error enters into that of the total cross section measured at lep .",
    "the experimental precision of the so - called invisible width ( number of neutrinos ) is strongly dependent on the precision of the luminosity measurement .",
    "the other quantities used for tests of the sm are also affected . in table",
    "[ stmod ] we show the influence of the luminosity error on the lep measurable used in the test of the sm .",

    "both experimental and theoretical components in the error of the luminosity went from the level of 2% to 0.1% . why was it always difficult to reduce the theoretical error even further ?",
    "the main obstacles were the need for non - trivial calculations of the higher - order contributions and the complicated event selection ( es ) in the actual measurement . due to the complicated es ,",
    "the phase - space boundaries in the calculation of the sabh cross section are too complicated for any analytical calculation .",
    "the calculation has to be numerical , the best being in the form of the monte carlo event generator mceg",
    ". the theoretical calculation would be completely useless if in the calculation of the sabh cross section we did not control its `` technical precision '' , corresponding to _ all _ possible numerical uncertainties .",
    "the control over the technical precision is probably the most difficult and labour - consuming part of the enterprise .      in the recent years",
    "the lep collaborations have used the bhlumi monte carlo event generator to calculate the sabh cross section for any type of experimental es .",
    "the program , originally written in 1988 @xcite , was published in 1992 @xcite with the first - order qed matrix element @xmath60 ( exponentiation according to the yennie - frautschi - suura theory ) and its matrix element was recently upgraded by means of adding the missing second - order in the leading - logarithmic approximation @xcite .",
    "bhlumi provides multiple soft and hard photons in the complete phase - space in all versions .",
    "the multi - photon integration over multi - photon phase - space remains essentially unchanged in bhlumi since the first version .",
    "gradual improvements concern mainly the matrix element .",
    "more and more cross - checks are built up in order to better determine its technical precision , see @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"<,>,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      following the above results the new estimate of the total theoretical error for the bhlumi cross section was obtained .",

    "the older results of ref .",
    "@xcite and the conservative projection of the theoretical error for lep2 are also given .",
    "the main progress is done for the missing photonic @xmath61 , which was reduced by 30% .",
    "this result is based on the agreement between bhlumi and sabspv for all four standard event selections , see example in fig .",
    "[ fig : sical92-alf2exp ] . the agreement within 0.1% between bhlumi and nllbha for the unrealistic bare1 trigger",
    "was also taken into account .",
    "the estimate of the missing photonic @xmath62 contribution is based on the result from the new calculation embodied in the lumlog event generator ( sub - generator in bhlumi ) @xcite .",
    "as we see , the older value of this contribution was underestimated .",
    "the light pair contribution was also previously underestimated and as a result of work and discussion within the working group it went up to 0.03% .",
    "there is a condition attached to the use of 0.03% for pairs ",
    "one has to use at least the ll calculation of the light pair production effect .",
    "if not , then 0.04% is recommended .",
    "the new , slightly better value of the vacuum polarization error is the result of recent works @xcite and @xcite . the corresponding programs for vacuum polarization are included in bhlumi @xcite .",
    "the improved calculation with a new smaller error tag for the z exchange was done during the workshop and published in ref .",
    "the corresponding improvement of the matrix element for the z exchange is implemented in bhlumi @xcite .",
    "the highest priority is now to calculate @xmath61 contributions and to implement them in the bhlumi monte carlo event generator .",
    "when this correction is under complete control , then the remaining biggest problem will be to determine and reduce the technical precision of the monte carlo calculation .",
    "( at present , technical precision is combined with the missing @xmath61 contribution . )",
    "there is an ongoing effort to calculate complete @xmath61 for the sabh process , see for instance refs .",

    ", we shall present the new unpublished numerical result for some important @xmath61 contribution , coming from the cracow  knoxville group .",
    "finally , let us mention only briefly the main results of the bhabha working group on the labh process . in the working group",
    "the first systematic comparison of seven different calculations was done .",
    "the agreement of 0.5% close to the z position was reached and at lep2 agreement at the level of 2% was seen .",
    "most of the programs were of the monte carlo type and the comparison was made for two realistic es s , calorimetric and non - calorimetric , each for two values of the collinearity cut .",
    "the resulting precision estimate essentially confirmed the expectation .",
    "the important achievement was that it was the first systematic comparison of the labh programs for a wide range of event selections .",

    "@xcite is up to 0.015% .",
    "this has to be multiplied by factor 2 because only the emission from the upper line is taken into account .",
