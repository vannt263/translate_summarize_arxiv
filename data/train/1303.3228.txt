    "the topic of quantum criticality continuously raises scientific interest because it is believed to be at the heart of the physics of emergent phenomena such as unconventional superconductivity , hidden order and the breakdown of the fermi liquid model.@xcite the phase transition from the disordered paramagnetic to ordered ferromagnetic state ( fm ) in zero magnetic field is a prototypical example of a critical point , i.e. , a second - order phase transition .",
    "the inherently low curie temperatures of metallic fms makes them ideal systems to investigate magnetic quantum criticality , because the curie temperature @xmath5 is often easily suppressed to zero temperature using an external tuning parameter such as pressure @xmath6 or chemical composition @xmath7 , resulting in a fm quantum critical point ( qcp ) .",
    "however , detailed experimental work on archetypal fm metals such as mnsi,@xcite uge@xmath8@xcite , and zrzn@xmath8@xcite , has demonstrated that the situation is more complex than this simple model would suggest .",
    "for these compounds , the fm phase is suppressed to zero temperature at a first - order transition ; i.e. , no quantum critical behavior is observed .",
    "this can be understood theoretically in various ways : e.g. , ( 1 ) additional fermionic modes may couple to the fm critical fluctuations and are expected to generically drive the phase transition to first - order,@xcite or ( 2 ) magnetoelastic coupling may cause a phase transition to become first order .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , each of these systems exhibit additional complicating factors that make it difficult to derive the universal behavior of fm quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) ; mnsi is a long - period helimagnet ( therefore only locally fm ) in which the thermal phase transition is weakly first - order,@xcite uge@xmath8 is a strongly uniaxial fm , and zrzn@xmath8 exhibits a marginal fermi liquid ground state.@xcite    these difficulties are further underlined by uru@xmath9re@xmath1si@xmath8 , which is believed to exhibit a fm qcp.@xcite uru@xmath9re@xmath1si@xmath8 has its own set of peculiarities , including unconventional critical scaling of the magnetization , non - fermi - liquid behavior not only in vicinity of the qcp but also within the fm phase , and @xmath10 scaling of the magnetic fluctuations not expected for conventional qcp scenarios in fms.@xcite a further issue may be the disorder associated with tuning via chemical substitution , which , in principle , may smear out the phase transition .",
    "we note that at least some of the unconventional behavior of uru@xmath9re@xmath1si@xmath8 may be understood within a theory that describes a fm kondo lattice.@xcite however , it is still unclear whether quantum phase transitions of fm metals are universally first - order .",
    "moreover , as pointed out by pfleiderer , both first- and second - order qpts may lead to interesting new phenomena in metallic systems.@xcite    the interest in the nature of fm qpts has been further intensified by the recent discovery of unconventional superconductivity ( sc ) in uranium - based compounds .",
    "the compounds uge@xmath8 ( under pressure),@xcite urhge,@xcite uir ( under pressure),@xcite and ucoge@xcite exhibit microscopic coexistence of sc and itinerant electron fm that is apparently associated with the uranium ions .",
    "this has led to the suggestion that the scing electrons in the uranium - based fm superconductors may pair in triplet states with parallel alignment of the electron spins , since such a configuration may not be subject to the same magnetic pair - breaking effects for a singlet sc ( although orbital pairbreaking could still be present ) .",
    "furthermore , it has been proposed that the sc in these compounds is mediated by critical fluctuations associated with a fm qcp.@xcite naturally , this raises the question of how the proposed first - order nature of fm phase transitions influences the sc state , since in that case critical fluctuations will be absent .",
    "in addition , sc with triplet pairing is thought to be extremely sensitive to disorder,@xcite demonstrating the need for a model system in which disorder effects on fm sc may be studied systematically .    in the present manuscript , we expand on our recent results for the alloy series uco@xmath0fe@xmath1ge which may shed some light on these questions.@xcite we report transport , magnetic , and thermal properties , which reveal an evolution from ferromagnetism in ucoge towards pauli paramagnetism in ufege.@xcite in agreement with a recent report which was restricted to small iron dopant concentrations,@xcite we find that @xmath5 initially increases and the superconducting critical temperature @xmath11 is rapidly suppressed . at higher iron concentrations , @xmath5 ,",
    "the ordered magnetic moment @xmath12 , and the magnetic entropy @xmath13 pass through a maximum and are then suppressed smoothly towards a quantum phase transition near @xmath14 .",
    "non - fermi - liquid ( nfl ) behavior is observed in the electrical resistivity and specific heat near @xmath15 .",
    "we also find that @xmath5 is suppressed with fe substitution in a manner that is consistent with theoretical expectations for a three dimensional itinerant electron ferromagnet.@xcite these findings point to the presence of a fm qcp at @xmath15 where deviations from theoretical predictions in the critical low @xmath16 behaviors are likely due to disorder .",
    "remarkably , we also find that samples with @xmath17 and 0.2 are very similar , suggesting that apart from the absence of sc ( above 50 mk , the lowest temperature to which the samples were measured ) around @xmath15 , the fm dome is symmetric with respect to its magnetic properties .",
    "the substitutional system uco@xmath0fe@xmath1ge thus presents a unique opportunity to investigate how disorder influences fm quantum critical fluctuations and their resulting emergent phenomena , namely superconductivity and/or non - fermi - liquid behavior , by comparing the qcp situated near @xmath18 ( accessible via pressure@xcite ) with the qcp at @xmath15 that is more affected by disorder .",
    "samples of uco@xmath0fe@xmath1ge , with various concentrations spanning the range from @xmath17 to 1 , were prepared using an arc furnace in a zirconium gettered argon atmosphere on a water cooled copper hearth .",
    "the starting materials were cut from solid pieces of pure uranium ( new brunswick lab , 3n ) , cobalt ( alfa aesar , 99.9+@xmath19 ) , iron ( alfa aesar , 99.99+@xmath19 ) and germanium ( alfa aesar puratronic , 99.9999+@xmath19 ) . after melting , each sample was flipped over and re - melted .",
    "this process was repeated five times in order to ensure homogeneous mixing of the starting materials .",
    "each as - grown boule was cut in half using a diamond wheel saw , and half of the sample was sealed under vacuum in a quartz tube and annealed at 900@xmath20c for 10 days .",
