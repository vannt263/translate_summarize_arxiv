    "now , as the creation of trapped bose - einstein condensates @xcite has nearly become a standard technique , the interest in the field has turned to the manipulation of trapped condensates . a major goal is the creation of coherent atomic beams emerging from bose condensates .",
    "such a device , now called an atom laser , was first realized in the mit - group @xcite .",
    "this experiment created a rather small number of strong pulses of atoms . recently two groups were able to produce continuous @xcite or at least quasi - continuous @xcite coherent atomic beams .",
    "after the initial proposals of atom - laser models ( see references in @xcite ) the theoretical treatment of atom lasers has focused on two major lines : the work in @xcite starts with the coupled gross - pitaevskii equations ( gpe ) ( and generalizations thereof like the hartree - fock - bogoliubov theory ) and analyzes the corresponding solutions either numerically or analytically .    on the other hand , the studies in @xcite",
    "concentrate on the characterization of atom lasers using master equations analogous to the work on optical lasers and calculate properties like the linewidth of atom lasers .",
    "there are two different means of coherent outcoupling , _",
    "i.e _ getting atoms out of atom traps , which are investigated both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "a radio frequency can be used to flip the spin - state of magnetically trapped atoms to an untrapped state ; this so called radio - frequency outcoupling @xcite has been used in @xcite .",
    "an output coupler based on raman transitions was first described in @xcite and implemented by the nist - group @xcite . in rf - outcoupling ,",
    "the atomic beam just falls downwards whereas two - photon raman - outcoupling can be arranged in such a way that the outcoupled atoms acquire momentum and the resulting beam may thus be pointed in a specific direction .    like in our previous work @xcite we concentrate on rf - outcoupling describing the setup of the hnsch - group @xcite by a 1d - model based on coupled gpes . in @xcite",
    "we were able to characterize the experimental output rate in a satisfactory way , differences were mainly due to the reduced dimensionality of the model . here , we want to investigate a slightly different setup that was recently realized experimentally : instead of only one rf - field bloch _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used two radio frequencies for outcoupling .",
    "consequently , the coherently outcoupled atoms have two different energies which leads to a pulsed , coherent atomic beam",
    ". we will analyze the output properties of such a device depending on the detunings of the radio frequencies and their difference .",
    "the paper has the following structure : in sec .",
    "[ sec : gpetheory ] we set the notation by introducing the basic facts about gpes and rf - atom lasers . in sec .",
    "[ sec : airy ] we first show how stationary falling waves can be described by appropriate combinations of airy functions .",
    "these are used to model the output of the two - mode atom laser and to calculate its average output rate .",
    "the analytical results of this section are then compared with numerical solutions of the coupled gpes ( sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] ) .",
    "it turns out that the visibility of the pulse pattern of the beam can be related to the correlation function of the trapped bose gas ( here at @xmath1 , see also @xcite ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] we summarize our results .",
    "the properties of bose condensates of atomic vapors at zero temperature are very well described by the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is a nonlinear schrdinger equation for the order parameter of the system , namely the macroscopic wavefunction of the bose condensate , and accounts also for the coherence properties of the condensate .",
    "it may thus serve as a starting point for considerations in coherent atom optics with bose condensates as it was done in @xcite : the authors generalized the gpe to a system of coupled equations that describe the physics of the trapped and untrapped states of a bose gas coupled via an rf - field including the interaction due to collisions .    in the present article , we modify this approach to a situation where the trapped atoms are exposed to two radio frequencies .",
    "such a setup has already been analyzed experimentally @xcite .",
    "we focus on a trap with rb-87 atoms in the @xmath0 hyperfine - manifold .",
    "the three zeeman sublevels with @xmath2 are described by macroscopic wavefunctions @xmath3 ; after applying the dipole approximation the system of generalized gpes reads @xmath4 we assume that all zeeman levels interact with the same s - wave scattering length @xmath5 so @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 denotes the total density in the trap divided by the number @xmath8 of particles .",
    "the interaction between the atoms and the radio frequency fields with frequencies @xmath9 and @xmath10 is described by @xmath11 where @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) is the rabi frequency corresponding to the magnetic field strength @xmath14 .",
    "we now define @xmath15 to be the average radio frequency and @xmath16 as the difference between the two driving fields . in order",
    "to get rid of the high frequencies , we apply the transformation @xmath17 and skip all terms @xmath18 ( rotating wave approximation ) .",
    "this turns eq .",

    "this is computationally very demanding . in earlier work @xcite",
    "a one - dimensional ( 1d ) approach has proven to be quite successful . usually , the traps used in experiments are elongated in the horizontal plane . like in @xcite",
    "we choose coordinates where the @xmath21-axis points _ downwards _ , the long axis of the trap is denoted by @xmath22 , the short horizontal one by @xmath23 .",
    "taking gravity into account , the total effective potentials in @xmath21-direction are then given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the detuning from the transitions at the trap center ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "due to gravity the output coupling proceeds mainly in the vertical direction so it is natural to choose this direction as the 1d axis for our model .    to obtain the effective interaction strength @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : veff ] ) we require the chemical potential in thomas - fermi approximation in the 1d model ( for the trapped @xmath28 state ) to equal the one of the full 3d situation .",
    "this leads to @xmath29 with @xmath30 .    the 1d approximation of eq .",

    "( [ eq : gpe1d ] ) which is characterized by @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the condensate is hardly affected in this regime , it merely changes its overall size due to the loss of atoms by the outcoupling process @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we have pointed out that the coupling between the trapped and untrapped states is concentrated spatially to the crossing points of the effective potentials in eq .",
    "( [ eq : veff ] ) . in the present case where two radio frequencies are present ,",
    "one expects two such points of maximal coupling .",
    "they are located at @xmath33 corresponding again to the crossing points of the effective potentials for either the radio frequency @xmath9 or @xmath10 ( see fig .  [",

    "[ fig : densities2res ] the densities of the states @xmath28 and @xmath34 ( @xmath0 ) are shown for a specific situation .",
    "the condensate is in the @xmath28 state , the plot shows a snapshot of the density distributions after @xmath35 of outcoupling ( for further computational details see sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] ) .",
    "the distribution for the @xmath36 state demonstrates clearly that the points @xmath37 are indeed the points of maximum outcoupling ; if one considers the two radio frequencies separately , these points correspond to the classical turning points in the effective potentials in eq .",
    "( [ eq : veff ] ) ( see @xcite ) .",
    "= 0.47    in the weak coupling region we are considering here , the state @xmath38 , which is also untrapped , is hardly populated at all .",
    "for this reason , its density distribution is not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : densities2res ] and we will not discuss it further . nevertheless , it is included in all numerical calculations .",
    "outside the condensate region , the untrapped @xmath39 state feels only the gravitational potential because the mean field contribution in @xmath40 is practically zero there . therefore , the wavefunction for the falling particles is a linear combination of airy functions , which are the solutions of the schrdinger equation for a linear potential",
    ". the usual airy function @xmath41 does not suffice to describe a continuous , stationary beam of falling atoms . in analogy",

    "the wavefunction @xmath47 , though being a solution of the schrdinger equation for a homogenous gravitational field , is not normalizable due to the exponential growth of @xmath48 in the classical forbidden region @xmath49 .",
    "this is to be expected , as it describes a situation where particles are flowing steadily to @xmath50 without a source of particles at some finite @xmath21 .",
    "nevertheless , we are only interested in the classically allowed region where the solution is perfectly analogous to a freely falling wave",
    ".    we will later make use of the asymptotic forms ( @xmath50 ) of @xmath51 and @xmath52 @xcite @xmath53 to obtain a nice interpretation for @xmath54 .",

    "one usually measures the probability density @xmath54 via some imaging technique . if the two energies @xmath59 are not too different from each other with respect to the mean energy @xmath63 , _ i.e. _ @xmath64 , then eq .  ( [ eq : psi0 ] ) can be taylor - expanded around @xmath65 . taking the asymptotic forms in eq .",

    "( [ eq : psi0 ] ) describes the output of the atom laser only after it has reached a kind of stationary operation .",
    "we therefore use @xmath74 merely as a free parameter to shift the pulses in time .      to determine the normalization factor of the wavefunction @xmath61 in eq .",
