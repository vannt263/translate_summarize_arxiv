    "statistical methods are required because , experimentally , some quantities can not be determined individually , but only as weighted average quantities ( this is the case for instance in emission / absorption spectra of highly ionized atoms ) . moreover , explicit quantum calculations can be inappropriate , e.g. if the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian are not known with sufficient precision .",
    "in addition , global methods can reveal physical properties hidden by a detailed treatment of levels and lines ( `` one can not see the wood for the trees '' ) @xcite .",

    "@xcite for the moments @xmath29 ( with @xmath30 ) of several kinds of transition arrays ( relativistic or not ) .",
    "it is useful to introduce the reduced centered moments of the distribution defined by    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the center - of - gravity of the strength - weighted line energies , @xmath33 is the standard deviation and @xmath34 is the total area of the distribution .",
    "the use of @xmath35 instead of @xmath28 allows one to avoid numerical problems due to the occurence of large numbers .",
    "the first values are @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the distribution @xmath3 is therefore fully characterized by the values of @xmath39 , @xmath32 , @xmath40 and of the high - order moments @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "the first four moments are often sufficient to capture the global shape of the distribution @xmath3 .",
    "the third- and fourth - order reduced centered moments @xmath43 and @xmath44 are named _ skewness _ and _",

    "the kurtosis is usually compared to the value @xmath45 for a gaussian .",
    "however , the choice of the distribution does not play any role in the derivation of the moments .",
    "in order to investigate the impact of skewness and kurtosis , it is possible to use the gram - charlier expansion series @xcite :    @xmath46    with    @xmath47    where @xmath48 , @xmath49 is the order of the moment and @xmath50 is the hermite polynomial of order @xmath51 obeying the recursion relation :    @xmath52    with @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the gram - charlier expansion series uses the reduced centered moments @xmath55 of the discrete distribution @xmath3 .",

    "[ fig1 ] ) , it exhibits some negative features .",
    "the levels of an electronic configuration verify approximate symmetries , which are called couplings in atomic spectroscopy .",
    "in fact , highly asymmetrical line distributions can be found due to some large @xmath60 exchange slater integral .",
    "this may happen in arrays of the type @xmath61 , which are very numerous , because in highly charged ions , the transitions decaying to the ground configuration belong to arrays of this type .",
    "the skewness increases steeply as a function of atomic number @xmath62 along an iso - electronic sequence .",
    "assuming hydrogenic behaviour , slater and spin - orbit integrals vary as @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "it was shown in that case by bauche et al .",
    "@xcite that @xmath43 behaves roughly as @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , asymmetry is particularly pronounced for highly ionized heavy atoms .",
    "they can also occur in situations where the spin - orbit interactions are strong enough to split the transition array ( medium- or high-@xmath62 elements ) . in the latter case ,",
    "the asymmetrical shape of the array can also be restored by considering the superposition of symmetrical subarrays .",
    "in fact , the impact of skewness is usually small in the conditions typical of the laser experiments conducted to date ( density of the order of 0.01 g/@xmath65 and temperature of a few tens of ev ) .",
    "[ fig2 ] displays the comparison between a skewed gaussian ( fourth - order gram - charlier ( see eq .",

    "the spectra are almost indistinguishable .",
    "if one wants to take into account the effect of asymmetry , it can be fruitfully done using the nig ( normal inverse gaussian ) distribution @xcite :    @xmath69    where @xmath70 is a modified bessel function of the third kind .",

    ", the nig ( see fig . [ fig3 ] ) can not have negative values .",
    "moreover , the validity domain of the nig is wider than the positivity domain of gram - charlier distribution , as shown in fig .",
    "the nig distribution enables one to model symmetric or asymmetric distributions with possibly long tails in both directions .",
    "the tails are much more prominent than in the gaussian distribution .",
    "an interesting choice to study solely the effects of the kurtosis is the generalized gaussian distribution ( gg ) , defined by :    @xmath74    where @xmath75 is a positive real number , and @xmath76 is the ordinary gamma function .",
