    "visible light communication ( vlc ) is an attractive field of optical wireless communications ( owc ) that exploits visible light emitting diodes ( vleds ) as optical sources .",
    "this technology which has emerged in recent years , uses the visible band of the electromagnetic spectrum . as a result",
    ", it offers an immense unregulated bandwidth for communication in the presence of illumination . furthermore , as light does not penetrate through walls , secure communication along with enabling frequency reuse between two rooms would be possible .",
    "moreover , since the active area of photo - detectors ( pds ) used in vlc is thousands of times greater than the wavelength of light , multipath fading does not occur , however , multipath distortion still can exist in such systems @xcite .    the demand for wireless bandwidth capacity as predicted by cisco ( cisco vni .",
    "feb 2015 ) shows a 10 times growth in mobile traffic for the next five years . on the other hand , during the same years , the mobile carriers are predicted to be accelerated by @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "in addition , most of mobile traffic takes place in indoor environments and at fixed locations .",
    "this makes vlc a highly probable technology for wireless access networks of the future home and office .",
    "as mentioned earlier , vlc provides illumination in parallel to communication .",
    "additionally , flicker mitigation and intensity control , also known as dimming control , are two noticeable requirements of such systems according to ieee 802.15.7 task group @xcite .",
    "thus , utilizing robust modulation schemes that supply high data rate along with dimming control are imperative .",
    "some dimming adaptable procedures for flicker - free high data rate vlc systems based on ieee 802.15.17 standard are studied in @xcite .    among different kinds of modulation schemes , pulse position modulation ( ppm ) and",
    "its families are appropriate for intensity modulation with direct detection ( im / dd ) communication systems such as vlc , since the chips within a code word can directly modulate a driver at the transmitter side . in recent years",
    ", many research interests have been attracted to overlapping ppm ( oppm ) and its applications due to its high spectral efficiency and low bandwidth requirement . in @xcite a method for supporting dimming by changing the amplitude of oppm symbol pulses is proposed .",
    "nevertheless , this may result in undesired chromaticity shift of the emitted light due to the characteristics of leds @xcite .",
    "researchers in @xcite proposed multiple ppm ( mppm ) to support dimming while transmitting data stream .",
    "they explored that mppm outperforms variable ppm ( vppm ) and variable on - off keying ( vook ) , in terms of spectral efficiency and power requirement .",
    "moreover , a solution to address the dimming control along with data transmission is suggested in @xcite by changing oppm code word weight .",
    "this research is inspired by the need to design a vlc system with more spectral efficiency and less power requirement . in this paper ,",
    "regarding dimming support by changing code weights of oppm symbols @xcite , we consider a practical scenario within a standard room , and we design a system according to constraining parameters . to do so ,",
    "we first determine an interval for dimming percentage in which the illumination standards are taken into account .",
    "then , we calculate the maximum data rate for inter - symbol interference- ( isi- ) free transmission by simulating the dispersive channel response .",
    "next , we propose a method to determine the maximum usable code length corresponding to a maximum bit error rate ( ber ) in the presence of different brightness percentages .",
    "owing the fact that the modification in modulation and using coding schemes are essential to performance enhancement of vlc systems @xcite , we suggest to apply trellis coded modulation ( tcm ) in order to take advantage of the corresponding coding gain which results in an improvement in the power requirement of oppm . also , the validity of such application is depicted by simulation results .",
    "vlc systems use im / dd transmission approach since it is an efficient technique in short range indoor wireless optical applications . in this work",
    ", we assume the non - directed line - of - sight ( los ) vlc link in which transmitters and receivers have a wide range of transmission and field of view ( fov ) , respectively ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . considering the baseband channel model for optical system , the photo - current generated by the receiver pd is given by ; @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the pd responsivity , @xmath4 is the transmitter optical power , @xmath5 represents the convolution operator , and @xmath6 is the receiver noise .",
    "this noise can be modeled as a signal dependent additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) with double sided power spectral density of @xmath7 as @xcite ; @xmath8 in which @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are shot noise variance , thermal noise variance , and the received power due to multipath reflection , respectively itself takes both incoming optical signal ( desired and undesired interfering signals ) and ambient background light into account . ]",
    "@xcite . moreover , the fact that @xmath4 represents the instantaneous optical power , necessitates @xmath12 as well as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the average optical power constraint of the transmitter led @xcite .",
    "[ 1 ]       consider an @xmath15-ary modulation scheme in the presence of awgn and the maximum likelihood ( ml ) sequence detection , as well .",
    "the @xmath15 non - negative symbols @xmath16 are sent with the bit rate @xmath17 every @xmath18 seconds . the average signal power is@xcite ; @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "assuming high signal to noise ratio ( snr ) , the ber is dominated by two nearest signals and is given by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the minimum euclidean distance between any pairs of valid symbols .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "1 , the electrical bit sequence , @xmath23 , is turned to parallel to be modulated by oppm encoder . then , after passing through filter and being normalized , the resulted modulated symbols , @xmath24 , will be sent to block tx , containing driver circuit and led arrays . in the case of oppm , the symbol interval @xmath25 is divided to @xmath26 chips and the temporal signal equation would be ; @xmath27 where @xmath28s , for @xmath29 , are binary @xmath26-tuples of weight @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is a rectangular pulse with unit amplitude in the interval @xmath32 $ ] . note that @xmath33 is always positive and fulfills the power constraint mentioned in .",
    "the @xmath30 ones are restricted to be successive whereby the bandwidth requirement in this modulation scheme becomes smaller compared to that of @xmath15-ppm or mppm .",
    "this advantage is offset by a reduction in the number of oppm alphabet size .",
    "the number of symbols in oppm is @xmath34 and the bandwidth requirement is given by ; @xmath35 hence , the maximum achievable bit rate and the spectral efficiency can be respectively calculated as follows @xcite ; @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the duty cycle .",
    "now , in contemplation of controlling the intensity of incident light , one can change the weight of symbols , @xmath30 , while remaining the number of chips , @xmath26 , unchanged @xcite .",
    "this technique is shown in fig . 2 in which four dimming levels are illustrated .",
    "obviously , in the cases of @xmath38 and @xmath39 , i.e. , full brightness and full darkness , respectively , no data could be transmitted .",
    "we also refer to @xmath40 as the perceived brightness percentage in that it is more compatible with the nonlinear response of the human eye to the linear changes in the intensity of visible light @xcite .    [ 2 ] .,title=\"fig:\",width=326 ]      the photo - current generated by pd is proportional to the received optical power ; therefore , the snr in a vlc link is proportional to the square of received average optical power .",
    "this issue makes vlc system vulnerable to the link length , i.e. , by increasing the distance between the transmitter and the receiver , the snr will significantly decrease due to the path loss .",
    "the snr is given by @xcite ; @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 stand for transmitted and received terms , respectively .",
    "@xmath44 is the portion of channel dc gain arising from the los link .",
    "the total channel dc gain resulted from both los and non - los ( nlos ) links is defined as @xmath45 .",
    "furthermore , the transfer function @xmath46 would be @xmath47 , in which the contribution due to the los link depends on the distance between the transmitter and the receiver , @xmath48 , as illustrated in fig . 1 ; while the second term relies on modulation frequency besides the room dimensions .",
    "the impulse response in the time domain is defined as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 represents dirac delta function and @xmath51 is the light velocity .",
    "additionally , the channel dc gain is @xcite ; @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes the pd active area , @xmath54 is lambert s mode number of a radiation lobe , @xmath55 in which @xmath56 represents the semi - angle at half power of an led , @xmath57 and @xmath58 represent the optical bandpass filter transmission and non - imaging concentrator gain of the receiver , and @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the angle of irradiance and incidence , respectively , as shown in fig .",
    "1 . thus , the received optical power from los path is @xmath61 .    for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we consider only the first reflection which is more dominant than the higher order reflections .",
    "so , the nlos channel response is given by @xcite ; @xmath62 where @xmath63 represents the reflectors surface ( consists of four walls in the hypothetical room ) , @xmath64 is reflection index of the @xmath65th reflector , @xmath66 is the element area of reflectors , and @xmath67 denotes the number of reflectors , i.e. , walls . for a diffused link scenario , two components are involved .",
    "first , elements of surfaces receive light from transmitter led .",
    "second , these elements re - emit a portion of received light to pd , as depicted in fig",
    "in this section , we design a system according to what was introduced in section ii . to do so , we first investigate a valid interval for dimming by which the illumination standards within a room are taken into account .",
    "then , we obtain the maximum bit rate at which the isi could be neglected and we compare it with the maximum achievable bit rate offered by oppm modulation , at a predetermined modulation bandwidth , with respect to different dimming levels . afterward , we propose a well - known coding scheme , namely tcm , to be applied to oppm in order to take advantage of the offered coding gain .",
    "finally , from the ber point of view , the minimum required code length to reach a maximum probability of error regarding channel constrains are investigated using mc simulations . with respect to designing a dimming compatible indoor vlc system assuming practical situation of an office room",
    ", we contemplate a @xmath68 @xmath69 room having four fixtures of leds as well as a table of height @xmath70 m under one of the fixtures with a pd on its center .",
    "this scenario is shown in fig .",
    "furthermore , the specification of transmitters and receivers utilized in simulations is summarized in table 1 where some of led and pd parameters are extracted from @xcite .    [ 3 ]      number of led fixtures & @xmath71 + led fixture area & @xmath72 @xmath73 + number of leds within a fixture & @xmath74 + led spacing in a fixture & @xmath75 cm + led power & @xmath76 mw + semi - angle at half power & @xmath77 + center luminous intensity & @xmath78 cd +   + position & @xmath79 m + area & @xmath80 @xmath81 + fov & @xmath82 + ambient light current & @xmath83 ma + responsivity & @xmath84 a / w +      the main goal of vlc systems is to provide illumination as well as communication .",
    "therefore , in an office environment the illumination generated by leds must satisfy illumination standards .",
    "the horizontal illuminance resulted by oppm modulation with dimming support on a surface is given by ; @xmath85 where @xmath86 represents the center luminous intensity of leds . according to @xcite , the standard illuminance level within an office room is between @xmath87 and @xmath88 lux .",
    "the variation of horizontal illuminance in terms of different dimming levels in the hypothetical room is depicted in fig .",
    "4 . note that this figure is obtained at the position of pd shown in fig .",
    "3 . hence ,",
    "concerning the illumination budget , a range of @xmath89 to @xmath90 percent of perceived brightness would be achievable .",
    "moreover , the distribution of illuminance within the room at @xmath91 of perceived brightness is illustrated in fig .",
    "it is worth to be mentioned that the acquired interval for dimming , fulfills the standard around the table on which the pd is installed .",
    "[ 4 ]     [ 5 ]   of perceived brightness.,title=\"fig:\",width=307 ]      the bit rate in vlc systems is affected by multipath reflections . an established criterion for defining its upper bound",
    "is root mean square ( rms ) of delay spread which is given by@xcite ; @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the mean delay resulted by nlos paths and @xmath94 is the dispersive channel impulse response , described in . therefore , to guarantee an isi - free transmission , the maximum bit rate should be less than @xmath95 .",
    "the delay spread parameter depends on room dimensions , location of transceivers , and also the fov of pd .",
    "6 depicts the distribution of rms delay spread within the room .",
    "this parameter at the position of pd in the hypothetical room is obtained as @xmath96 ns .",
    "hence , the bit rate would be upper bounded by @xmath97 mbps .",
    "on the other hand , the maximum bit rate theoretically achievable for different modulation schemes , namely vook , mppm , and oppm , versus @xmath89 to @xmath90 percent of perceived brightness is illustrated in fig .",
    "the oppm modulation scheme not only gives the highest bit rate ( e.g. , up to @xmath98 mbps compared to mppm and vook @xcite which give @xmath99 mbps and @xmath100 mbps , respectively , at @xmath101 of perceived brightness ) , but also referring the peak value of oppm bit rate , which is @xmath98 mbps , is less than the upper bound achieved due to channel constraint , namely @xmath97 mbps .",
    "note that the modulation bandwidth of leds is supposed to be about @xmath99 mhz , because although the bandwidth offered by off - the - shelf phosphor - based leds is about @xmath102 mhz , it could be improved to @xmath99 mhz by installing a blue filter on pd in order to remove the yellowish component of the received light @xcite .",
    "[ 6 ]     [ 7 ]       it is widely known that tcm improves system performance without increasing the required bandwidth . since oppm symbols have relatively low duty cycle and equal energy , if the duty cycle @xmath103 stands fix , then doubling the number of symbols @xmath15 leads the bandwidth to remain constant @xcite . for this reason , the number of chips of the eventuated tcm @xmath104-oppm can be calculated as @xmath105 and the equivalent weight would be @xmath106 .",
    "however , by applying tcm to oppm the minimum hamming distance between symbols decreases which causes to a growth in the probability of error .",
    "fortunately , the arisen coding gain via set partitioning retrieves the performance degradation of reduced minimum hamming distance .",
    "8 outlines the set partitioning of the oppm with @xmath107 .",
    "the bandwidth requirement of the tcm @xmath104-oppm is the same as uncoded oppm and can be calculated using , yet the required average power could be lessened as is described in the following .",
    "considering the minimum hamming distance as @xmath108 for uncoded oppm @xcite , the ber would be ; @xmath109 by solving the last equation for @xmath14 , the average required optical power of the uncoded oppm can be extracted as ; @xmath110 nevertheless , for tcm @xmath104-oppm we have ; @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the minimum hamming distance between tcm @xmath104-oppm symbols .",
    "therefore , the consequent coding gain , in terms of db , is given by ; @xmath113 for the sake of achieving the coding gain , @xmath112 needs to be greater than four , e.g. , examine @xmath114-oppm with @xmath115 .",
    "a coding gain equal to @xmath116 db is attainable by choosing a @xmath71-state set partitioning of the tcm @xmath117-oppm with @xmath118 along with the same bandwidth requirement .",
    "altogether , the superiority of trellis coded oppm over uncoded oppm is depicted in fig .",
    "9 , in which the power requirement to achieve a ber of @xmath119 through the given room is plotted in terms of the qualified dimming interval . as mentioned in , although the required power for uncoded and tcm @xmath104-oppm with @xmath120 are the same , increasing @xmath112 to @xmath121 and @xmath122 leads to a reduction of @xmath123 db and @xmath0 db in power requirement , respectively with the same bit rate .",
    "[ 8 ]     [ 9 ] ) in terms of allowable dimming interval at the location of pd within the hypothetical room.,title=\"fig:\",width=326 ]      as the third part of system design considered in this paper , we need to analyze the system from the ber viewpoint .",
    "referring and assuming @xmath124 for uncoded oppm and also @xmath125 , one can write ; @xmath126 in this equation , @xmath26 is the code length which needs to be chosen in order to achieve an acceptable bit error probability .",
    "to do so , the maximum ber of @xmath127 as a threshold for forward error correction ( fec ) is supposed .",
    "the parameter @xmath7 in contains the contributions of shot noise , thermal noise , and multipath reflections .",
    "therefore , we simulate the system shown in fig . 1 in two steps .",
    "_ step i : _ a transmitter containing oppm encoder sends modulated symbols through the channel in which the noise is considered to be awgn . at the receiver side the temporal data streams after passing through a filter which is matched with the transmitted pulse shape , @xmath31 , and being sampled with rate @xmath128 , are detected using a hard decision block . finally , the bit error probability is calculated using mc simulation , in terms of different snrs .",
