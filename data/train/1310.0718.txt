    "the terminology `` intensive and extensive quantity '' was introduced by richard c. tolman @xcite in order to distinguish between different thermodynamical parameters , properties , variables , etc .",
    "therefore , the defining of such quantities as intensive or extensive may depend on the way in which subsystems are arranged @xcite . in order to characterize possible critical phenomena of the nuclear collisions , which likely become complex at ultra high energy ,",
    "various signatures have been proposed @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that the critical phenomena of intensive or extensive variables @xcite should be differentiated .",
    "the extensive variables , like total charge multiplicity , obtain about equal contributions from the initial ( due to fluctuations in spectators ) and final stage ( resonances ) .",
    "the intensive variables , like particle ratios , are well described by resonances at the freeze - out @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we show how the distinguishability between extensive and intensive quantities behaves at various energies and with different initial conditions .",
    "the implication of statistical - thermal models on high - energy physics dates back to about six decades @xcite .",
    "koppe introduced an almost - complete recipe for the statistical description of particle production @xcite .",
    "the particle abundances in fermi model @xcite are treated by means of statistical weights .",
    "furthermore , fermi model @xcite gives a generalization of the _  statistical model ",
    "_ , in which one starts with a general cross - section formula and inserts into it a simplifying assumption about the matrix element of the process , which reflects many features of the high - energy reactions dominated by the density in phase space of the final states . in 1951",
    ", pomeranchuk @xcite came up with the conjecture that a finite hadron size would imply a critical density above which the hadronic matter can not be in the compound state , known as hadrons . using all tools of statistical physics , hagedorn introduced in 1965 the mass spectrum to describe the abundant formation of resonances with increasing masses and rotational degrees of freedom @xcite which relate the number of hadronic resonances to their masses as an exponential .",
    "accordingly , hagedorn formulated the concept of limiting temperature based on the statistical bootstrap model .    the statistical and thermodynamical variables , properties and parameters can be classified into intensive , extensive , normalized intensive and extensive , process and conjugate .",
    "there are physical properties which neither intensive nor extensive , e.g. electric resistance , invariant mass and special relativity .",
    "the intensivity is apparently additive and therefore a state variable .",
    "the intensive ( bulk ) properties do not depend on the system size or the amount of existing material .",
    "therefore , it is scale invariant .",
    "the extensivity is field and point variable but not additive .",
    "the extensive properties are additive for independent and non - interacting subsystems .",
    "they are directly proportional to the amount of existing material .",
    "normalized intensive and extensive quantities are densities .",
    "they are not additive .",
    "the process depends on past history of the system .",
    "therefore , they are differentiable , inexactly .",
    "the conjugates are intensive and extensive pairs , like temperature and entropy . for example , in grand canonical ensemble , strongly intensive quantities have been suggested as fluctuation measures not depending on the system volume and its fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the charge distribution is inclusive , while isotropically resolved particle observation is an exclusive property .",
    "we review the evolution of some statistical and thermodynamical quantities measured in difference sizes of the high - energy collisions at different energies .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "the intensivity and extensivity of statistical properties are shortly reviewed in section [ sec : inexstat ] .",
    "the dissipative properties are elaborated in section [ sec : inexdiss ] .",

    "other intensive properties can be derived from these known ones .",
    "an exclusive property implies that energy and momentum , for instance , of all products are measured .",
    "the intensivity means that some quantities of the products are left unmeasured .    an extensive comparison between the particle multiplicity @xmath3 per participating nucleon at mid - rapidity in central heavy - ion collisions  @xcite and the corresponding results from @xmath0+@xmath0(@xmath1 )  @xcite and @xmath2+a collisions  @xcite is presented in fig . [ nfigjbrkepsltau ] .",
    "it is obvious that the energy dependence of the total multiplicity is distinguishable . in order words ,",
    "the initial state plays an essential role .",
    "the extenstivity can be related to canonical ensemble , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the hamiltonian , while grand canonical ensemble is related to intensivity , @xmath6 where @xmath7 stands for the degrees of freedom . with dirac delta function and",

    ", it can also be concluded that the statistical - thermal models including hrg seem to excellently describe the hadronization at very large energies and the condition deriving the chemical freeze - out at the final state of hadronization , the constant degrees of freedom or @xmath14 , seems to be valid at all center - of - mass - energies spanning between ags and lhc .",

    "the rapid decrease of @xmath27 at very low energy , fopi data , refers to _ bounce - off_. increasing @xmath29 , a _ squeeze - out _ will set on . at larger energies ,",
    "the behavior can be described by _ in - plane elliptic flow _ due to pressure gradient .",
    "the elliptic flow shows a rich structure ; a transition from in - plane to out - of - plane and back to in - plane emission .",
    "apparently , it is sensitive to the properties of the medium created in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "there are evidences that the elliptic flow of charged and identified particles indicates a strong rise of the expansion velocity of the medium ( radial fow ) at rhic vs lhc .    on the other hand",
    ", it was assumed that there are no correlations due to elliptic flow in pp collisions at rhic energy @xcite .",
    "the methods of measuring elliptic flow can hardly be employed with the currently available number of recorded pp interactions of alice at the lhc .",
    "furthermore , none of available microscopic monte carlo ( mc ) models describes the development of anisotropic flow in elementary hadron - hadron interactions yet @xcite .",
    "particular non - perturbative approach was suggested as a mechanism of anisotropic flow might be a leading one in hadron collisions , since those have smaller geometrical extension and the probability of hydrodynamical generation of elliptic flow is lower compared to the collisions of nuclei @xcite .",

    "the hagedorn temperature in @xmath12 collisions seems to be smaller than that in @xmath13 collisions .",

    "a much more systematic measurement would help in proving or disproving such a conclusion .",
    "the ultimate goal of the physics program of high - energy collisions is the study of properties of strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions of temperature and/or compression .",
