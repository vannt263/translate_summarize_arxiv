    "one of the fundamental questions in physics is whether the fundamental constants are truly constant . indeed",
    "the possibility of cosmological variation of `` constants '' has long been proposed@xcite . among the fundamental constants , the gravitational constant",
    "@xmath0 is the least accurately measured .",
    "the value of @xmath0 is measured in the laboratory and applied to all scales . to check for the constancy of @xmath0",
    ", tests should be done at different spatial and temporal scales .",
    "there are many tests at redshifts of order 0 .",
    "for example , the lunar laser ranging experiment , which monitors the distance between the earth and the moon by laser ranging technique , can be used to put a bound on the variation of @xmath0@xcite .",
    "if @xmath0 varies during the history of the earth , the surface temperature and size of the earth would change .",
    "however the earth does not preserve a good record of the gravitational conditions .",
    "increase in @xmath0 causes the sun to burn at a faster rate , and the depth of the convective zone is affected , which can be observed in the vibrational modes of the sun , in particular the @xmath9 mode@xcite .",
    "since an increase in @xmath0 also shortens the life spans of stars , the ages of stars in globular clusters can be used to put a constraint on the deviation of @xmath0 from its present value @xcite . because the chandrasekhar mass @xmath10 sets the mass scale of neutron stars , by observing the masses of neutron stars formed at different redshifts , limits on @xmath0 in the past 10 gyr or so have been derived in @xcite .",
    "the highest redshift , of about @xmath11 , constraint comes from big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "an increase in the expansion rate during the epoch of bbn causes the freeze - out to occur earlier , and the abundances of neutron and hence @xmath12he are enriched@xcite . for details of various experiments and observations ,",
    "see the review article by uzan@xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    on the theory side , there have been grand unification theories and string / m theory motivated models predicting that some of the fundamental `` constants '' , such as the fine structure constant @xmath13 and the newtonian gravitational constant @xmath0 , may vary over time . in theories with extra dimensions , the effective gravitational constant in 4d spacetime depends on the more fundamental mass scale in the bulk and the size of the extra dimensions@xcite . if the size of the extra dimensions evolves over time , the effective constants in 4d will vary as well .",
    "for example , the dgp model@xcite has been put forward to explain the recent observation that the universe is in an accelerating phase without invoking the dark energy .",
    "it was argued that the acceleration is due to the leakage of gravity into the extra dimensions .    to select promising ones from the myriads of models in the literature , one may constrain possible variations of the fundamental `` constants '' using observational data .",
    "there have been efforts trying to constrain the possible variation of @xmath0 using cosmological data .",
    "in particular , since the cosmic microwave background anisotropies ( cmba ) is sensitive to many cosmological parameters , it could be used to constrain the variation of @xmath0 .",
    "cmba is unique because it offers a long look back time .",
    "the physics of cmba is particularly clean as it involves only well known physics in the linear regime .",
    "one approach is to constrain the variation of @xmath0 in some particular types of models , _",
    "e.g. _ the cmba spectra in the brans - dicke cosmology are discussed in ref .",
    "however , given the multiplicity of models in the literature , it seems more practical to use a simple and generic parametrization for @xmath0 . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors have used the cmba power spectra to constrain the possible variation of @xmath0 with a parameter @xmath14 as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the present laboratory - measured value .",
    "it was assumed that @xmath14 is a constant over the age of the universe ( and only suddenly becomes 1 at the present time ) .",
    "however this assumption is unrealistic since we know that @xmath0 should converge to its present value to avoid conflicts with other experiments and observations .",
    "we shall call the convergence of @xmath0 to its present value _",
    "one can imagine that @xmath0 may vary in many different manners over the history of the universe , and so it is hopeless to deal with all possibilities one by one . in this article",
    "we study two generic stabilization schemes .",
    "one of them is instantaneous stabilization .",
    "that is we consider an abrupt gravitational transition and model the variation of @xmath0 by a step function : @xmath17 where @xmath2 is the scale factor and @xmath18 is the scale factor at which stabilization occurs .",
    "another is that @xmath0 varies smoothly and we parametrize it as a linear function of @xmath2 : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the scale factor at the time of photon decoupling .",
    "our main goal is to constrain the range of @xmath21 in eq .",
    "[ eq : parametrization1 ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : parametrization2 ] .",
    "we assume that the underlying mechanism for the variation of @xmath0 does not affect other physics so that the standard cmba calculation with the modifications of eq",
    ".  [ eq : parametrization]-  [ eq : parametrization2 ] is valid . the friedmann equation is modified as @xmath22 with @xmath23 where a dot denotes derivative with respect to the conformal time , @xmath24 is the present hubble parameter , @xmath25 is the density parameter of the non - relativistic matter , @xmath26 is the density parameter of radiation , and @xmath27 is the density parameter of the cosmological constant .",
    "note that we consider a flat universe here .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the effects of variation of @xmath0 on the cmba power spectra are investigated in section  [ sect : effect ] . in section  [",
    "sect : mcmc ] , we study the constraints on the variation of @xmath0 by the three year wmap data using the method of markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) and discuss the results obtained .",
    "section  [ sect : conclusion ] is devoted to the conclusion .",
    "it has been pointed out in ref .  @xcite that the cmba angular power spectrum does not change using the simple prescription eq .",
    "[ eq : parametrization ] as far as the dynamical equations are concerned .",
    "the ratio between the sound horizon and the distance to the last scattering surface ( lss ) , @xmath28 , will not change if both are blown up by the same factor due to the varied gravitational constant in the flat universe .",
    "however , the scaling is not perfect since the recombination physics does introduce another scale .",
    "the recombination is dictated mainly by the binding energy of hydrogen atom , which is not affected by a change in the gravitational constant .",
    "if the expansion rate is greater during the epoch of recombination , it will be more difficult for the protons and electrons to recombine , and the ionization fraction @xmath29 will increase .",
    "the probability density that a photon last scatters at a conformal time @xmath30 is given by the visibility function ( for a review of cmba physics , see for example @xcite ) , @xmath31 with @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the number density of electrons and @xmath34 is the thomson cross - section .",
    "the increase in @xmath29 broadens @xmath35 , resulting in more severe damping of the high @xmath36 peaks .",
    "however the duration that the photons stay in contact with the lss is also shortened as the expansion rate is greater .",
    "because the two effects partially cancel each other , the damping is not increased much even when @xmath0 is increased by a large amount . in fig .",
    "[ fig : gspectrum ] , we show the temperature power spectra for @xmath37 and 3 compared to the unchanged one ( @xmath38 ) for the case of of instantaneous stabilization with the stabilization redshift @xmath39 . a large change in @xmath0 is required for noticeable changes in the spectra .",
    "the damping effect can be partially compensated by reionization , and so the details of reionization such as the degree of reionization affect the sensitivity of the spectra to @xmath14 .",
    "the above conclusion that the cmba angular power spectrum is not sensitive to the value of @xmath0 is based on the assumption that the gravitational constant remains different from the present laboratory - measured - value till `` yesterday .",
    "'' however @xmath0 must converge to its present value so that there is no conflict with the low - redshift constraints . when @xmath0 changes as described in eq .",
    "[ eq : parametrization1 ] or eq .",
    "[ eq : parametrization2 ] , the expansion history of the universe is modified , the fractional change in the sound horizon at the epoch of decoupling is different from that in the conformal distance to the lss , and the resultant cmba spectra will be distorted .",
    "[ fig : g_varywithz ] shows the temperature power spectra with instantaneous stabilization at @xmath40 and 10 .",
    "note that the `` standard '' spectrum ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) nearly coincides with the one for @xmath43 and @xmath42 . if , however , the stabilization redshift is at @xmath44 , the spectrum for @xmath45=1.2 ( 0.8 ) shifts to larger ( smaller ) @xmath36 scales .",
    "in fact , it is conceptually simpler to compare the one for @xmath46 , @xmath42 to the one with @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the size of the sound horizon is the same for both cases while the distance to the lss is increased for @xmath44 ; as a result @xmath28 becomes smaller and the spectrum shifts to high @xmath36 scales .",
    "the same argument applies to the one with @xmath48 and @xmath44 , but with the opposite effect .",
    "because of the dramatic gravitational transition , we observe an enhanced late integrated sachs wolfe ( isw ) effect in the small @xmath36 scales .",
    "we observe similar sideway shifts in the e - type polarization and te cross polarization spectra as well . in fig .",
    "[ fig : e_g_stab ] , we show the e - polarization power spectra with instantaneous stabilization at @xmath42 and 10 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors proposed that the degeneracy between the expansion rate and the scalar spectral index @xmath49 can be lifted by measuring the polarization , because the formation of polarization is proportional to the width of the visibility function .",
    "an increase in @xmath0 causes the power of the polarization spectrum to increase in small @xmath36 scales and then decrease in large @xmath36 scales .",
    "but the effect of stabilization is much more appreciable .",
    "when @xmath0 varies linearly with @xmath2 , its effects on the cmba power spectra are still dominated by the sideway shifts discussed in the instantaneous stabilization scenario , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : glinear ] .",
    "the effects are qualitatively similar for the two stabilization schemes that we use .",
    "since our prescription is simple , we can easily estimate the amount of shift in the cmba spectrum due to stabilization .",
    "this calculation is similar to that of the cmb shift parameter@xcite . from eq .",
    "[ eq : friedmann ] , we have the conformal distance to the lss @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the present conformal time , and @xmath52 is the conformal time at cmb decoupling .",
    "one immediately sees that if @xmath53 is larger , the conformal distance will be smaller .",
    "this is reasonable because it takes less time for the universe to expand to its present size .",
    "the peak positions in the cmba temperature angular power spectrum in a flat universe can be characterized by @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the sound horizon : @xmath56 the sound speed @xmath57 is given by @xmath58 with @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are mass densities of baryons and radiations respectively .",
    "it should be pointed out that the sound horizon also depends on @xmath14 through @xmath30 .",
    "hence if @xmath62 at the epoch of cmb decoupling , the size of the sound horizon will also be smaller .",
    "in fact , the reduction rates for @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the same if there is no stabilization ; the effects of @xmath14 are exactly cancelled , a manifestation that the peaks do not shift if there is no stabilization . however , when there is stabilization , two different scales will be introduced and the peak positions will shift .",
    "we now illustrate with the case of instantaneous stabilization .",
    "the calculations can be simplified by noting that if there is no stabilization , the peaks do not shift even if @xmath65 .",
    "the sound horizon is the same irrespective of stabilization if it takes place after decoupling .",
    "hence we only need to compare the conformal distance between the case with stabilization and the one without it : @xmath66 where the subscript @xmath67 denotes no stabilization and @xmath68 denotes with stabilization . from eq .",
    "[ eq : ldr_relation ] , the shifts in the peak positions due to the change in @xmath0 are given by @xmath69 plugging in the standard @xmath70cdm model parameters , we have @xmath71 one may proceed similarly for linear variation of @xmath0 , but it is too cumbersome to write down the results explicitly .",
    "we display @xmath72 against @xmath45 in fig .",
    "[ fig : semianalytic_shift ] .",
    "we see that the shift in @xmath36 from the simple arguments here agrees with the full numerical calculations in fig .",

    "[ eq : simplifiedeq ] tracks closely the one from complete calculations of @xmath55 and @xmath73 .",

    "for the plot on the left , the thick ( red ) solid curve corresponds to @xmath18=0.1 and the dashed curve to @xmath18=0.5 .",

    "because the cmba angular power spectra are sensitive to various parameters , to be consistent , other relevant parameters should also be varied when fitting with data .",

    "the cmba constraints on @xmath117 will be potentially one of the best constraints .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to strengthen the constraint by including the matter power spectrum as well since enhanced isw effects are induced by the gravitational stabilization .",
    "previously , cmba was used to constrain the variation of @xmath0 without considering stabilization . not only are the resultant limits weak , but also this assumption does not respect many tight local constraints . in this work we consider two simple and generic parametrizations of @xmath0 , the instantaneous stabilization and linear stabilization .",
    "stabilization causes appreciable sideway shifts in the cmba power spectra , and hence the sensitivity of cmba to the variation of @xmath0 is enhanced .",
    "we use the three year wmap data to constrain the model parameter(s ) and other cosmological parameters . for the case of instantaneous stabilization , we simultaneously constrain @xmath45 and @xmath92 to [ 0.89 , 1.13 ] and [ 0 , 5.57 ] to @xmath90 intervals . for the linear stabilization scenario , @xmath84 is set to 0 and we get the 95% confidence interval [ 0.89 , 1.13 ] , which is equivalent to @xmath118 yr@xmath119 .",
