    "superposition principle is a basic feature of quantum mechanics ( qm ) .",
    "when applied to composite systems superposition leads to nonlocal coherences and quantum correlations ( entanglement ) which have been extensively studied in the last years , and are even expected of central interest for physics to come @xcite .",
    "as it is known , quantum coherences and entanglement are potential resources in various quantum information processes , even if they suffer any sort of environmental action which represents a serious obstacle towards these applications . on the other hand , it is just this fragility with respect to the environment , that is , the propensity to disperse information throughout inaccessible degrees of freedom that explicates the quantum - classical transition @xcite .    an interesting point raised in @xcite concerns the possible finite time disentanglement for bipartite systems , as opposite to the usual local decoherence asymptotic time . an experimental evidence of this peculiar trait of entanglement has been reported recently by almeida et al .",
    "this issue has been analyzed @xcite in a simple and realistic model where two initially entangled two - level atoms separately interact with the multimode vacuum noise of two distinct cavities .",
    "the authors find out that the nonlocal decoherence may take place suddenly or at least as fast as the sum of the normal single atom decay rates .",
    "this sudden death of entanglement has been analyzed also for two jaynes - cummings ( jc ) atoms @xcite .",
    "also in this case the dynamics of the entanglement between the atomic internal variables shows different peculiarities for different initial states , with possible sudden decays that are however followed by periodic revivals , due to recovery of information by the system , being the cavities lossless .    in this paper",
    "we wish to investigate if the separate non dissipative interaction of each two - level atom with one only degree of freedom but of continuous variables , may play the role of the interaction with a reservoir leading to an irreversible disentanglement of the bipartite system .",
    "as well known , the optical stern - gerlach ( osg ) model @xcite gives the opportunity of modifying the jc model by including the interaction between the internal and the external atomic dynamics via the e.m .",
    "mode of the cavity field , so actually providing the coupling of each qubit to one only degree of freedom .",
    "it has already been shown that this non dissipative coupling leads to a decoherence in the dynamics of a single atom @xcite and also affects the entanglement in the internal dynamics of two atoms that successively interact with the same cavity @xcite .",
    "as will shown in what follows , the same interaction gives rise to a disentanglement of the bipartite system which exhibits strong analogies with the disentanglement generated by the vacuum noise @xcite .",
    "let us consider two identical isolated two - level atoms , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively crossing two distinct ideal cavities , @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( in a direction orthogonal to the cavity axis ) , as in the osg model .",
    "these two uncoupled subsystems are described by the total hamiltonian @xmath5 where , in resonant conditions and in the rotating wave approximation for both atoms ,    [ hab ] @xmath6    to simplify the notation we will sometimes use the indices @xmath1 and @xmath2 to indicate the two subsystems @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the cavity fields are , as usually , described by the bosonic operators @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and the two cavity frequencies @xmath13 , as well as the coupling constants @xmath14 for the two subsystems , are assumed to be the same . the @xmath15 spin operators @xmath16 , @xmath17 account for the internal dynamics of @xmath18-th atom , while the conjugate variables @xmath19 and @xmath20 describe the external motion of the same atom along the axis direction of the corresponding cavity ( @xmath21 )",
    ".    when the initial uncertainties @xmath22 of the atomic wave packets are sufficiently small with respect to the wavelength @xmath23 of both modes @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) assumes the form ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite for one atom case ) @xmath24 where @xmath25 are constant of motion .",
    "similarly for the subsystem @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath26 is the ( operatorial ) rabi frequency depending on the atomic position ( with respect to a nodal point of the related cavity mode function ) and on the excitation number of the @xmath18-th subsystem . using previous results @xcite for the one atom case ,",
    "it is easy to show that the evolution operator may be written as @xmath27 where @xmath28 and it has been assumed that each atom enters the own cavity at the same time .",
    "in this section we will analyze for the two different configurations considered in ref.@xcite , the time evolution of the initial entanglement between the two qubits under the effects of the interaction of each qubit with its own cavity and , consequently , of the coupling with its own translational motion .",
    "we will see that , differently from the usual jc model , in this case the elements of the reduced density matrices that describe the atomic internal dynamics show damped oscillations as a consequence of the osg effect which causes a splitting of the atomic packets . as we will see later",
    ", this damping affects the entanglement decay whose rate is actually related to the phase space distance of the scattered packets .",
    "the section ends with a brief account of the results for the one atom osg model , which are useful to explicate relations and differences between the decay rates of nonlocal entanglement and local coherences .",
    "let us first suppose that the configuration of the entire system at time @xmath29 may be written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 describe the translational dynamics along the cavity axes of atoms @xmath1 and @xmath2 , while @xmath33{\\left\\vert00\\right\\rangle},\\,\\ ( 0\\leq\\gamma\\leq\\frac{\\pi}{2})\\ ] ] shows that the two qubits are initially in a superposition of the bell s states usually denoted @xmath34 , and the two cavities are in the vacuum state .",

    "however , while the population decay depends on the square distance @xmath63 between the packets moving in opposite directions ( through the scalar product @xmath81 ) , the coherence experiences a four time slower decay since it depends on the square distance @xmath82 between one of the moving packet and the standing packet related to the ground state ( scalar product @xmath83 ) .",
    "it is moreover to stress that , because of the non dissipative character of the decay , the qubit upper population does not go to zero , as in the spontaneous emission , but tends to half of the initial value .",
    "as it is generally convenient for these bipartite mixed states we will analyze the time evolution of the entanglement between the internal variables of the two atoms , looking at the concurrence @xcite .",
    "it is not difficult to show that the concurrence of the state ( [ roabmatrix1 ] ) is @xmath84 the entanglement with the non relevant systems causes a degradation of the nonlocal correlation between the qubits . according to previous results ( see , for example @xcite ) , and as shown in fig.[fig1 ] , state ( [ chi0 ] ) gives rise to asymptotic disentanglement with the same rate of the decoherence . because of",
    "the particular dynamics of the osg model , in this case the disentanglement rate is one half time the population decay rate .",
    "finally , we note that , for @xmath85 , i.e. when translation dynamics of the center of mass of the two atoms is not taken into account , the concurrence ( [ concu ] ) reduces to that derived in @xcite for the two jc atoms case .",
    "more interesting results are expected for the initial state ( [ chi02 ] ) , for which the concurrence is @xmath86 where @xmath87 the behavior of concurrence ( [ concu2 ] ) is shown in fig.2 .",
    "also in this case , the coherence @xmath88 between the two atoms goes to zero as @xmath69 in the previous case does .",
    "however , the concurrence experiences in this case a sudden death because of the probabilities @xmath89 of finding the atoms in the two states @xmath35 and @xmath65 which are not correlated to the others and which tend to @xmath90 for long time . figure ( [ fig2 ] )",
    "makes evident the strong dependence of the entanglement life - time on the parameter of the initial two qubit state ( [ chi02 ] ) , similarly to the theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite results .",
    "however , in this two last papers it is outlined that only some initial entanglements may undergo to sudden death . on the contrary , due to the particular environmental action of the osg model , there is no threshold in our case .",

    ".      we will now inquire on the separability of the reduced density matrices ( [ roabmatrix1 ] ) and ( [ roabmatrix2 ] ) adopting the peres - horodecky test @xcite . as it is known , for two qubits the non - negativity of the eigenvalues of the partial transposed matrix works as a necessary and sufficient condition for the separability .",
    "consider first the partial transposed of ( [ roabmatrix1 ] ) , @xmath95 whose elements are given by eq.s ( [ coeff2 ] ) .",
    "we easily find that three eigenvalues of ( [ sigabmatrix1 ] ) ,    @xmath96^{1/2},\\label{eig11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    are non - negative , while the forth eigenvalue @xmath97^{1/2}\\ ] ] assumes only non - positive values , as figure ( [ fig3 ] ) shows .",
    "we wish to point out that for the initial state ( [ chi0 ] ) the two qubits display epr correlations @xcite for all times , but for isolated points ( see fig.([fig1 ] ) ) .",
    "accordingly , one can see from the analytical expression of @xmath98 ( more accurately than from fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) ) that the bipartite system is not separable but for isolated points , and tends to the separability for long times",
    ".    finally , for the density matrix ( [ roabmatrix2 ] ) relative to the initial state ( [ chi02 ] ) the partial transposition gives @xmath99 whose elements are given in this case by eq.s ( [ coeff3 ] ) .",
    "as in the previous case , three eigenvalues @xmath100 are non - negative , while a forth eigenvalue @xmath101 takes on negative values for some time intervals ( see figure ( [ fig4 ] ) ) , in exact correspondence with the existence of a concurrence ( see figure ( [ fig2 ] ) ) .",
    "in this paper it has been analytically derived the time evolution of the initial entanglement of two atoms which separately interact with two distinct cavities .",
    "we have used the optical stern - gerlach model to include the external translational dynamics of each atom .",
    "the presence of entanglement has been ascertained trough the concurrence and the separability and we have found , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , that the two atom internal dynamics follows different patterns and becomes irreversibly separable in different times , depending on the different initial configurations . as found in other contests @xcite which use different environments and where the disentanglement is due essentially to spontaneous emission , also in the osg model the entanglement may undergo to an irreversible sudden death .",
    "in addition , the particular non dissipative environment here considered suddenly destroys the initial entanglement of bell s states @xmath0 superposition ( eq . [ chi02 ] ) for any initial value of @xmath94 .",
    "this can in part be ascribed to the peculiar dynamics of the qubits in the osg model in which the population @xmath89 ( matrix ( [ roabmatrix2 ] ) ) of the non correlates states @xmath35 and @xmath65 does not go to zero , but tend to @xmath90 for long time .",
    "we can consequently conclude that nonlocal coherences manifest an amazing fragility even towards a non dissipative environment made of a single degree of freedom ."
