    "the phase diagram of hot and dense matter out of quarks and gluons described by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) has attracted theoretical and experimental interest for decades  @xcite .",
    "we can define one phase transition associated with chiral symmetry restoration in the vanishing quark mass limit ( i.e.  @xmath1 ) which is commonly referred to as the chiral phase transition . in the quenched limit with infinitely heavy quark mass ( i.e.@xmath2 ) ,",
    "on the other hand , we can define another phase transition from the hadron ( glueball ) phase to the color deconfinement phase .",
    "the question is then the nature of these phase transitions with intermediate quark masses of two light ( _ up _ and _ down _ ) and one heavy ( _ strange _ ) flavors .",
    "we stress that the chiral and deconfinement phase transitions are conceptually distinct phenomena and , theoretically speaking , they reside in the opposite limits with respect to the quark mass .",
    "nevertheless , the standard qcd phase diagram on the plane of the temperature @xmath3 and the chemical potential @xmath4 has only a single transition or crossover boundary . whether this is really the case is not trivial _ a priori _ and not quite settled yet .",
    "it is the result from the monte - carlo integration of the ( quenched ) qcd partition function on the lattice that had led us to this phase diagram with a single phase boundary  @xcite .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein for historical background . ) later on , the lattice qcd simulation with dynamical quarks  @xcite have confirmed that the chiral and deconfinement phase transitions occur at the same temperature ( or at different but close temperatures  @xcite ) .",
    "this observation suggests that two phenomena of chiral restoration and color deconfinement should be locked by some dynamical mechanism so that they should take place ( nearly ) at once .",
    "we can find the first successful study based on dynamical model to give an account for this locking mechanism in the work by gocksch and ogilvie  @xcite .",
    "they have constructed the effective action of qcd by means of the strong coupling and large dimensional expansions .",
    "the same action has been discussed at finite @xmath3 and @xmath4 also by ilgenfritz and kripfgantz  @xcite .",
    "there were proposed some generic mixing arguments which aim to explain the coincidence of critical temperatures in a model independent way  @xcite . the mixing effect , however , does not suffice to force two crossovers to be a single one in view of the associated peaks in the susceptibility ; two separate crossovers ( susceptibility peaks ) with mixing for each can not be ruled out .",
    "that means , the mixing effect is a necessary but not sufficient condition in order to realize the coincidence in a way seen on the lattice  @xcite .",
    "thus , the locking between chiral restoration and deconfinement should need more tangled dynamical properties of two phenomena .    to reveal the relevant dynamics",
    ", the present author proposed a useful model  @xcite based on the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite with the polyakov loop degrees of freedom augmented , which was inspired by the strong coupling analyses  @xcite .",
    "the peculiar feature in this model is that we can uniquely determine the coupling between the chiral condensate , which is an order parameter for the chiral phase transition in @xmath1 , and the polyakov loop , which is an order parameter for the deconfinement phase transition in @xmath2 .",
    "the model inputs and outputs have been carefully compared to the lattice qcd data by ratti , thaler , and weise  @xcite and they named this hybrid description as the _ pnjl model_.    the pnjl model has been generalized to the three - flavor case recently  @xcite . in the present paper we shall extensively explore the phase diagrams in the three - flavor pnjl model by changing four physical variables , namely , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , the light quark mass @xmath5 , and the heavy quark mass @xmath6 . first we revisit the choice of the polyakov loop effective potential that can not avoid ambiguity in the pnjl model approach .",
    "we claim that a careful consideration is necessary for the effective potential form .",
    "once we fix the pure gluonic sector by specifying the potential , we can calculate the mean - fields of the chiral condensate and the polyakov loop to draw the phase diagrams .",
    "although it is usually assumed implicitly , we have no first - principle insight into the locking of two crossovers in the finite - density region .",
    "the lattice monte - carlo simulation is of no practical use except when @xmath4 is much smaller than @xmath3 .",
    "so far it seems that almost nothing but the pnjl model can access both transitions at any density . strictly speaking , in fact , the mean - field treatment of the pnjl model is not totally free from the sign problem .",
    "detailed analyses in ref .",
    "@xcite support that the saddle - point of the mean - field energy leads to an appropriate estimate for the mean - fields , however .",
    "hence , we will not argue the sign problem any more in the present work .    in this paper",
    ", after we check that our results from the three - flavor pnjl model are consistent with the state - of - art lattice simulation at zero chemical potential  @xcite , we will shift our emphasis toward the qcd ( chiral ) critical end - point in the last half .",
    "it should be noted that the terminal point of the first - order phase boundary has a second - order phase transition characterized by the universality class of the z(2 ) ising model and this special point is often called the qcd critical point .",
    "the search for the critical point is one of the most interesting problems in finite density qcd because it provides us with a firm milestone for our quest for the qcd phase diagram .",
    "if we are lucky enough to find out the critical point as predicted in theory , we can get confident about our theory reliability .",
    "this is , so to speak , a mutual correspondence between theory and experiment , which is an ideal situation for sound scientific developments .",
    "the existence of the qcd critical point has not been established yet .",
    "we can not exclude a possibility that the qcd phase transition is smooth everywhere in the @xmath4-@xmath3 plane , while there are a pile of indirect evidences for its existence  @xcite . in model studies , in fact , a minor modification in the treatment could easily smear a first - order phase transition out into a crossover , as demonstrated later . in particular we shall pay attention to two obscure factors which may significantly affect where the critical point is and even whether it exists .",
    "those two factors are the magnitude of the @xmath0-breaking anomaly interaction and the vector - channel interaction .",
    "the former , the @xmath0-breaking term , induces a six - quark vertex called the t  hooft term which mixes three different flavors up and is responsible for the first - order phase transition in the chiral limit  @xcite . it could be possible at finite temperature and density that the t  hooft interaction",
    "is reduced by instanton suppression  @xcite .",
    "the latter effect , i.e.  the vector - channel interaction term , does not break chiral symmetry and the zeroth component directly couples the quark density .",
    "it is thus likely that the finite - density environment enhances or induces interactions in the vector channel which could weaken the first - order phase transition  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall quantify these effects on the location of the qcd critical point using the three - flavor pnjl model .",
    "the present author proposed the pnjl model action in ref .",
    "@xcite inspired by the effective action in strong - coupling qcd with dynamical quarks  @xcite .",
    "it is possible to some extent to elaborate a field - theoretical setup for the pnjl model starting with the lagrangian density  @xcite . for this purpose",
    "it is required to assume a homogeneous mean - field distribution of the polyakov loop . in other words , the temporal component of the gauge field , @xmath7 , in euclidean space - time",
    "must be approximated by a spatially constant mean - field , so that one can perform the one - loop integration with respect to thermal quarks in a closed form .",
    "this thermal integration leads to the unique coupling between the chiral condensate and the polyakov loop .",
    "spatial uniformity is in fact a mean - field ansatz , however , and it makes a contrast to the strong - coupling framework  @xcite , as we shall discuss shortly .    in the pnjl model the polyakov loop is therefore put in as a global mean - field rather than a local dynamical variable , which is analogous to the treatment of the chiral condensate in the ordinary njl model ; the lagrangian density with a shift by the mean - field is sometimes referred to as the mean - field lagrangian that contains no kinetic term for the mean - field .",
    "such an approximation should work to investigate the bulk property of the thermodynamic system , while we have to be aware that the mean - field model can not properly deal with the spatial structure of confined objects .",
    "it is beyond the scope of the simple pnjl model framework , for instance , to extract the heavy - quark potential .",
    "all the model ingredients are thus given as mean - field variables .",
    "here we would prefer to start with the mean - field free - energy after one - loop integration for the model setup .",
    "let us decompose the free - energy below into four pieces and discuss them in order .",
    "that is , the total free - energy ( or the grand potential ) is a sum of four contributions ; @xmath8 where @xmath9 represents the condensation energy in the chiral sector , @xmath10 the zero - point energy which is important in the njl model formulation , @xmath11 the thermal quark contribution with the polyakov loop coupling coming from the dirac determinant , and @xmath12 gives the effective potential in terms of the polyakov loop variable . as indicated in eq .",
    "( [ eq : total_energy ] ) , we can deduce the first three from the standard njl model and the last one from the pure gluonic theory .",
    "we can read the condensation energy from the standard njl model lagrangian . using the notation by hatsuda and kunihiro  @xcite , we write the four - quark interaction in the scalar channel and the six - quark t  hooft interaction as @xmath13 \\,,\\ ] ] and @xmath14\\,,\\ ] ] respectively . for later convenience",
    "we also give an expression for the vector - channel interaction ; @xmath15 for the moment we will work only in the @xmath16 case .",
    "here , @xmath17 s are the gell - mann matrices in flavor space ( with @xmath18 ) and the matrix determinant is taken also in flavor space . in the mean - field approximation with three condensates , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 ,",
    "the scalar four - quark interaction is rewritten as @xmath22 in the @xmath23-quark sector and likewise for @xmath24-quarks and @xmath25-quarks . in this way",
    "we can readily reach the following expression for the condensation energy ; @xmath26 we see that the six - quark interaction induces the flavor - mixing interaction indeed which makes the phase transition of first - order in the presence of massless three flavors .",
    "the zero - point energy diverges and requires the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath27 to regularize the three - momentum integration .",
    "since the njl model is a non - renormalizable cutoff theory depending on the choice of @xmath27 , the zero - point energy contribution largely affects the model output . with the quasi - quark energy dispersion relation , @xmath28 ,",
    "the zero - point energy can be expressed simply as a summation of all @xmath29 , that is , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the spin degrees of freedom , @xmath32 is the number of colors , and the particle and anti - particle contributions cancel @xmath31 in the denominator of @xmath29 .",
    "the constituent quark mass is defined as a sum of the current quark mass and the mean - field as @xmath33 which is understood from the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ex_u ] ) .",
    "the thermal quark energy is where we can uniquely introduce coupling between the chiral condensate and the polyakov loop . in the pnjl model , under the assumption of the presence of the spatially uniform polyakov loop background , the one - loop free - energy is modified as @xmath34\\notag\\\\   & \\quad + \\ln\\det\\bigl[1+l^\\dagger{\\mathrm{e}}^{-(\\varepsilon_i(p)+\\mu)/t}\\bigr ]    \\bigr\\ } \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let us comment on preceding works  @xcite in which a similar coupling form is addressed .",
    "we note that the above expression is identical with that in the strong coupling expansion but the physics content is slightly different .",
    "the polyakov loop @xmath35 is a mean - field from the beginning here , whereas the strong coupling calculation at finite temperature decouples the temporal hopping from spatial link variables  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the quark excitation is static in the strong - coupling leading order , and the above expression results at each lattice site in this way , that is , @xmath35 could be a local variable in the strong coupling expansion .",
    "it is noteworthy that the three - momentum integration above is finite and has no need for the ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "we can thus relax the cutoff in the thermal quark energy , though we found that the @xmath25-quark sector behaves unnaturally at extremely high temperature without the cutoff , which is of no importance practically . in this work",
    "we will not impose the momentum cutoff onto the thermal quark energy in order to let the thermodynamic quantities free from cutoff artifact .",
    "the polyakov loop @xmath35 is an @xmath36 matrix in color space and is defined originally in terms of @xmath7 .",
    "the explicit form of the polyakov loop is irrelevant in our study because we treat it as a model variable and will not return to the original definition of the polyakov loop in terms of the gauge field .    in the simplest mean - field approximation",
    "one can express the free - energy as a function of the traced polyakov loop expectation value defined by @xmath37 it should be mentioned that we must distinguish @xmath38 and @xmath39 at finite density  @xcite ; both @xmath38 and @xmath39 are real , and nevertheless , @xmath40 whenever @xmath41 .",
    "this is because a finite chemical potential gives rise to a @xmath42-odd term like @xmath43 $ ] in the average weight leading to @xmath44)^2\\rangle>0 $ ] for small @xmath4 .",
    "we can also give an intuitive explanation ; @xmath39 represents the exponential of the free - energy gain , @xmath45 , by the presence of an anti - quark .",
    "the test charge brought in by an anti - quark can be more easily screened in a medium with more quarks than anti - quarks .",
    "therefore , @xmath46 , that means , @xmath47 for a positive @xmath4 .",

    "since the polyakov loop corresponds to the longitudinal gauge field , the stefan - boltzmann limit should be saturated by the transverse gluons but not the polyakov loop .",

    "the locking of chiral restoration and deconfinement remains at finite density in this sense .",
    "it would be misleading , however , to dive into a conclusion that two phenomena of chiral restoration and deconfinement simultaneously take place in the high density region . in view of the polyakov loop behavior at low temperatures , in fact ,",
    "the discontinuous jump is tiny and the expectation value of the polyakov loop stays vanishingly small even at @xmath197 where chiral symmetry is restored .",
    "therefore , the discontinuous jump in the polyakov loop signifies a first - order phase transition from nearly confined matter ( @xmath198 ) with chiral symmetry breaking ( @xmath199 ) to nearly confined matter ( @xmath198 ) with chiral symmetry restoration ( @xmath200 ) .",
    "it is an interesting question how the polyakov loop behaves such differently from the chiral condensates in the region of low temperature and high density .",
    "this is because center symmetry is not broken at zero temperature even in the presence of dynamical quarks , and therefore , the expectation value of the polyakov loop must stay vanishing .",
    "the reason for preserved center symmetry is to be understood intuitively as follows ; when the quark density is specified by a certain chemical potential , each energy level is occupied by a quark up to the fermi surface .",
    "because quarks have color degeneracy , red , green , and blue quarks always sit on the same energy level , which makes a color singlet .",
    "one can easily see this really happening in the model from the dirac determinant given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : det_lp ] ) and ( [ eq : det_la ] ) . that is , when @xmath201 we only have the second term out of the whole particle contribution , @xmath202 that is exponentially dominant for large @xmath203 .",
    "this second term , @xmath204 , actually represents the three - quark occupation which does not couple @xmath38 and thus not break center symmetry .",
    "the third and fourth terms are one - quark and two - quark ( which is equivalent to one anti - quark in color ) contributions with non - trivial ( non - singlet ) color .",
    "consequently , the polyakov loop is insensitive to whether the quark degrees of freedom are present in the system or not . strictly speaking",
    ", the pnjl model can not deal with confinement , namely , nucleon wavefunctions as a bound state out of three quarks , but still , the low temperature region always has a signature of confinement ( @xmath198 ) with respect to quarks .",

    "@xcite is that the baryon or quark number density serves as an order parameter to tell the quarkyonic phase from the hadronic phase .",

    "one likely explanation for this is that the t  hooft ( six - quark ) coupling constant , @xmath59 , is weaker in the njl model estimate than realistic because of cutoff artifact .",
    "it should be mentioned that the value of @xmath59 is fixed to reproduce the @xmath64 mass , which is as large as @xmath245 and is greater than the cutoff @xmath246 .",
    "it is not unlikely that the strength of @xmath59 has been underestimated to reproduce such a large mass in this cutoff model .    , where @xmath247 is a value fixed in the vacuum in the hatsuda - kunihiro parameter set.,width=283 ]    figure  [ fig : gd ] shows the first - order transition boundary on the @xmath5-@xmath6 plane . here",
    "@xmath247 denotes the standard value in the hatsuda - kunihiro parameter set .",
    "because @xmath247 has been fixed in the vacuum , @xmath59 in a hot and dense medium might take a different ( presumably smaller ) value .",
    "as we anticipated , the first - order region becomes wider with larger @xmath59 and narrower with smaller @xmath59 .",
    "it should be noted that the plot is made in the linear scale in fig .",
    "[ fig : gd ] , while the scale is logarithmic in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_mm ] .",
    "one can then expect that the qcd critical point should move accordingly as @xmath59 changes .",
    "we show the location of the qcd critical point for various values of @xmath59 in fig .",
    "[ fig : nocep ] .",
    "we can learn two lessons from this figure : one is that the qcd critical point can be located at higher temperature and lower density if @xmath59 is underestimated in the njl model study due to too heavy @xmath64 out of model reliability .",
    "the other is in a sense opposite to the first one .",
    "the qcd critical point might be absent from the qcd phase diagram if @xmath59 is suppressed by the effective @xmath0 restoration at high density .",
    "actually , only @xmath248 reduction is enough to make the qcd critical point disappear from the phase diagram . if the suppression is exponential like @xmath249  @xcite , @xmath248 reduction is within a reasonable reach .",
    "then , one could change the scenario in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_mm ] by introducing a @xmath4-dependent value for @xmath59 .",
    "for instance , if one assumes an exponential ansatz , @xmath249 , one could find some @xmath250 that produces a boundary surface with bending behavior that the first - order transition region shrinks with increasing @xmath4 .",
    "it is not only the @xmath0 anomaly term but also the vector - channel interaction term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vec ] ) that can affect the location of the qcd critical point .",
    "we remark that @xmath251 does not break chiral symmetry at all , and besides , the zeroth component corresponds to the density operator @xmath252 .",
    "therefore , it is conceivable to expect that the finite density environment brings about non - zero @xmath253 even though we choose @xmath253 to be zero in the vacuum .",
    "there is no constraint at all for the choice of induced @xmath253 at finite density .",
    "we have no knowledge on even its sign .",
    "since we regard @xmath253 in the present study as induced in dense quark matter , the choice of @xmath253 has nothing to do with the vector meson property in the vacuum .",
    "[ it might be related to an in - medium modification . ]",
    "it is presumably appropriate to measure the strength of @xmath253 in unit of @xmath58 , and we just try various values of @xmath253 to grasp a feeling of its effect .",
    "there are two modifications necessary to accommodate the vector - channel interaction .",
    "the condensation energy should be @xmath254 where we already defined @xmath206 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nq ] ) . at the same time",
    ", the quark chemical potential should be replace by the renormalized one , @xmath255 like the quark mass replaced by the constituent one .",
    "then , we have to solve the number constraint equation , @xmath256 , together with the four gap equations self - consistently . in view of the condensation energy part",
    ", positive @xmath253 seems to decrease the free energy for non - zero @xmath206 , but the chemical potential renormalization overcomes it and the free energy becomes greater . because chiral symmetric phase has smaller @xmath196 and thus larger @xmath206 , the vector - channel interaction with @xmath257 delays chiral restoration .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : vector ] in the same way as in fig .",
    "[ fig : nocep ] .",
    "it is remarkable that the qualitative feature is quite similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : nocep ] .",
    "thus , we can draw the same conclusions as in the case of the @xmath0 anomaly term .",
    "the qcd critical point could be absent again in the case when @xmath253 is greater than around @xmath258 .",
    "the critical value turns out to be consistent with the known value in the two - flavor case  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the normalization of @xmath58 in refs .",
    "@xcite is different from the present convention by a factor @xmath31 .",
    "this value of critical @xmath253 is small as compared to the empirical value suggested by the fierz transformation . if we take care of the effect of the effective @xmath0 restoration , as we illustrate in fig .",
    "[ fig : nocep ] , the critical @xmath253 could be even smaller .",
    "we have formulated the @xmath110 flavor pnjl model with a simple ansatz for the polyakov loop effective potential .",
    "we first confirmed that our model setup works pretty well to account for recent results in the zero - density lattice qcd simulation .",
    "we then explored our perspective toward the finite - density qcd phase transition .",
    "the phase diagram in our model study turns out to have three ( crossover ) boundaries corresponding to @xmath259-quark chiral restoration , @xmath25-quark chiral restoration , and deconfinement characterized by the polyakov loop expectation value .",
    "we have also computed the quark number density and found that its behavior is governed by the @xmath23-quark chiral condensate .",
    "our phase diagram is consistent with the large @xmath260 argument and , in particular , we identified the phase region with vanishing polyakov loop and nonzero quark number density as the quarkyonic phase",
    ".    it would be intriguing to include the diquark condensates to describe a family of the color superconducting phases .",
    "the large @xmath260 argument can not access physics of color superconductivity , and thus , nothing so far could predict the fate of the quarkyonic phase region under the effect of color superconductivity .",
    "one possibility is that the quark - hadron continuity realizes at low temperature and high density , and there appears crossover from the quarkyonic phase to the color superconducting phase , which is to be interpreted as crossover from confined to deconfined quark matter .",
    "we remark that this continuity scenario requires three flavors and there have already been other scenarios ( i.e.  phase transitions with the coexisting regions ) within the pnjl model framework  @xcite .    also , we have closely investigated parameter dependence of the location of the qcd critical point .",
    "we demonstrated that the qcd critical point moves quite easily in accord to the choice of the @xmath0 anomaly strength and the vector - channel interaction . both are not under theoretical control at finite density .",
    "in fact , we have found that the critical values of these parameters are within a conceivable range in dense quark matter .",
    "that means , not only the location but also the existence of the qcd critical point is not robust at all in the model study .",
    "although we limited our discussions only to numerical results in this paper , it could be viable to examine the density dependence of the columbia diagram in an analytical way  @xcite .",
    "analytical understanding should be useful for the lattice qcd study from the zero density approaching toward the critical point .    to establish the existence or non - existence of the qcd critical point , anyway",
    ", we must wait for future development of the finite - density lattice simulation , or experimental confirmation .",
    "[ see also refs .",
    "@xcite for proposed experimental signatures . ]    finally , let us refer to some of recent attempts in the pnjl model .",
    "the neutrality condition has been considered in ref .",
    "it is known that the neutrality plays an important role especially in bulk superconducting quark matter . because the ( untraced ) polyakov loop is a color matrix ,",
    "there arise non - trivial coupling between the polyakov loop and the color chemical potential , which may bring a subtle difficulty involving the gauge choice .",
