    "however , the most pressing problem for a direct ism - solar system isotopic connection concerns the fact that , while @xmath0n and d meteoritic hotspots do seem to correlate in some samples ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "yet , as has been noted by several authors @xcite , the low - temperature interstellar environments most conducive to producing large @xmath0n enrichments , should also produce concomitantly enormous molecular d / h ratios ( e.g. in ammonia or hcn ) .",
    "thus , one would expect @xmath0n and d hotspots to _ always _ be spatially correlated , contrary to what is seen .",
    "this presents a serious challenge for ion - molecule fractionation chemistry .    in cold interstellar environments",

    "the major interstellar collision partner , molecular hydrogen , has a 170.5  k difference in zero point energy between the @xmath20 ( antiparallel spins ) and the @xmath21 ( aligned nuclear spins ) forms ; this allows some endoergic reactions to proceed , even at low temperatures , if a substantial fraction of the h@xmath1 is in the higher energy form , @xmath22-h@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that a high h@xmath1 ortho - to - para ratio ( opr ) therefore inhibits ( ` poisons ' ) the production of h@xmath1d@xmath3 in reaction ( 1 ) , suppressing the overall deuteration .",
    "the fractionation of @xmath0n may also be influenced by the opr of h@xmath1 .",
    "ammonia formation is initiated by the production of n@xmath3 from n@xmath1 by he@xmath3 , which then reacts in @xmath23 followed by a sequence of ion - molecule reactions with h@xmath1 through to nh@xmath24 and a final electron dissociative recombination .",
    "reaction [ amminitreac ] has an activation energy of @xmath25200 k @xcite which , at low temperatures , can be overcome by the internal energy of _ o_-h@xmath1 .",
    "thus , ammonia formation and the related @xmath0n fractionation in dark clouds are dependent on the h@xmath1 opr @xcite , a distinction not made in earlier models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a recent re - assessment of the opr dependence in the original experimental data by @xcite indicates that previous work has overestimated the low - temperature rate coefficient for reaction [ amminitreac ] , involving _",

    "in this letter we quantify the effect the h@xmath1 opr has on interstellar @xmath0n fractionation , and demonstrate that this can account for the isotopic anomalies observed in primitive solar system materials .",
    "we consider the chemical evolution of the central regions of a static prestellar core @xcite with a gas density @xmath26(h@xmath1)=10@xmath27 @xmath28 , a temperature of 10  k and a visual extinction of @xmath29@xmath3010 magnitudes .",

    "other temperature - dependent h@xmath1 reactions have energy barriers that are too high for the ground - state energy difference between the spin types to have a significant effect at 10 k.    initially the h@xmath1 opr is set to the high temperature statistical equilibrium value of 3 .",
    "measurements in the diffuse ism by @xcite are consistent with an h@xmath1 opr around 1 ; we find adopting this lower value has little effect on our results .",
    "the reaction @xmath40 is exothermic by 170.5 k and so @xmath22-h@xmath1 is efficiently converted into @xmath41-h@xmath1 at low temperatures .",

    "[ 15nnetworkfig ] ) , the he@xmath3 chemistry dictates the time - scale of fractionation .",
    "in particular , the rate for the reaction @xmath43 has previously been assigned widely different values at 10 k , ranging from 1.1@xmath3210@xmath44  @xmath37s@xmath34 @xcite to 2.5@xmath3210@xmath45  @xmath37s@xmath34 @xcite .",

    "[ 15nnetworkfig ] ) , the inclusion of a spin - state dependence does not significantly affect the evolution of fractionation in the nitriles : the @xmath0n enhancement starts to build up from the initial pool of atomic @xmath0n early on , and continues to increase until gas - phase abundances have dropped to below 10@xmath45 .",
    "the @xmath12n/@xmath0n ratios in gas phase hcn and hnc lie in the range @xmath55 .",
    "when all nitriles are frozen out , the @xmath0n enhancement in the bulk of nitrile ices ( cn , hcn , hnc , h@xmath13cn ) is @xmath565 .",
    "the inclusion of spin - state dependence does however have a dramatic effect on the @xmath0n fractionation in ammonia .",
    "the relative delay in the timing of the late enhancement peak in the current model , as compared to @xcite , stems from the higher rate ( @xmath57 ) of reaction ( [ hepreac ] ) ( see sect .  [ he+sect ] ) .",
    "however , the main difference is that the nh@xmath13 enrichment is not monotonic in time .",
    "the sharp decrease starting around 2@xmath3210@xmath52 years ( time b ) ( i.e. an increase in @xmath12nh@xmath13/@xmath0nh@xmath13 ) , is caused by the inefficiency of reaction ( [ amminitreac ] ) as the @xmath22-h@xmath1 abundance drops ( see fig .",

    ", we compare abundances to isotopologue ratios at crucial times in the evolution , marked by vertical lines a , b , and c in fig .",
    "[ standardmodfig ] .",
    "initially , the limiting reaction for fractionation is the production of @xmath0n@xmath3 , and the @xmath12n/@xmath0n ratio in ammonia is simply double that of @xmath12n@xmath1/@xmath12n@xmath0n . as gas - phase co",
    "gets depleted after @xmath5610@xmath58 years ( a ) , more he@xmath3 becomes available to produce @xmath0n@xmath3 , which starts to enrich the nitrogen hydrides beyond that of n@xmath1 .",
    "however , after @xmath5610@xmath52 years , the h@xmath1 opr drops below @xmath59 ( b ) , reaction ( [ amminitreac ] ) becomes less efficient , and more @xmath0n@xmath3 is instead circulated back into molecular nitrogen by @xmath60 @xcite , lowering the @xmath0n fraction in ammonia to less than half the elemental fraction .",
    "the reason for ammonia to subsequently become @xmath0n enriched after 10@xmath27 years ( c ) is that the molecular nitrogen fraction decrease substantially .",
    "this both reduces the fraction of @xmath0n@xmath3 converted back into molecular form ( fig .",
    "[ 15nnetworkfig ] ) , and decreases the amount of @xmath12n@xmath3 available to produce @xmath12nh@xmath13 .",
    "fractionation changes in the bulk of amine ices follows the pattern of gas - phase fractionation , but with a time lag and not as pronounced extreme values .",
    "while the bulk of amine ices on grains has @xmath0n fractions within 30% of the elemental fraction , at any given time the fractionation in the outer monolayer may show much larger variations @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ 15ndfig ] the calculated deuterium fractionation in h@xmath5 is plotted together with the molecular @xmath0n fractionation .",
    "the d / h ratios in other gas phase molecules , in atoms , and therefore also in the accreted molecular ices , will closely follow that of h@xmath5 .",
    "the increase in deuteration follows very closely the drop in @xmath22-h@xmath1 abundance , and after 2@xmath3210@xmath52 years ( time b ) , ratios of d / h@xmath301% are predicted .",
    "these trends in both deuteration and opr evolution agree well with previous investigations @xcite .    fig .",
    "[ 15ndfig ] shows that gas phase chemistry can indeed reproduce the requisite range of d and @xmath0n enrichments in nitrile and amine functional groups .",
    "three fractionation patterns develop as the core evolves :    \\(i ) for times less than about @xmath61 years , gaseous nitriles can develop large enrichments in @xmath0n ( @xmath62 ) but will only be modestly enriched in d , as observed ( e.g. dnc / hnc @xmath63 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; this will be reflected in the accreted ices .",
    "ammonia will be similarly enriched in d but less enriched in @xmath0n than the nitriles . at this stage",
    "the nitrile gas - grain fractionation is complete .",
    "\\(ii ) between @xmath64 years , the remaining ammonia can become highly fractionated in d but is either not enriched , or even depleted , in @xmath0n .",
    "\\(iii ) beyond @xmath65 years , ammonia becomes very highly enriched in both d and @xmath0n .",
    "thus , the model naturally produces a range of d-@xmath0n fractionation in nitrile and amine functional groups that is qualitatively consistent with that found in primitive organic matter . in general , the highest @xmath0n enrichments and lowest d enrichments should be carried by nitriles .",
    "amines could account for the fractionation of material that is highly enriched in d only , as well as the material that is simultaneously highly enriched in both d and @xmath0n .",
    "this functional - group dependency has already been noted in analyses of meteoritical samples .",
    "however , an important caveat is that conversion of nitriles to amines by h and d additions on grain surfaces ( e.g. hydrogenation of hcn to ch@xmath1nh and ch@xmath13nh@xmath1 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has to be negligible .",
    "the 30% enrichment of the bulk ammonia ice can not account for all the enhanced ammonia fractionation measured in carbonaceous chondrites ( @xmath66 ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , we predict @xmath67 as the highest gas phase enrichment and this will lead to higher @xmath68 ratios in the uppermost monolayers of the stratified ices @xcite .",
    "interstellar gas phase @xmath6 ratios in nitriles have been measured in several galactic sources selected for being unlikely to have experienced significant isotopic fractionation @xcite . for cold dark cores ,",
    "fewer measurements exist ; our model predicts very low @xmath6 ratios for hcn and hnc . for ammonia , the observed @xmath68 ratios in dense protostellar cores ( @xmath69 ,",
    "* ) are consistent with the modest enrichments which can occur within @xmath70 years .",
    "the measurement of @xmath71 in l1544 @xcite is consistent with the prediction that @xmath0n nuclei can be underabundant in ammonia .",
    "it also suggests a chemical age of @xmath72 years for the fractionated ammonia gas ( fig .",
