    ", however , the evidence of physical states being bound states is indirect .",
    "especially the plethora of hadrons finds a natural explanation in the assumption of hadrons being composite but their constituents do not exist as free particles .",
    "this phenomenon is called _",
    "confinement_.    the focus of these lectures is the infrared behaviour of qcd  green functions ( for recent reviews see _ e.g. _",
    "refs.@xcite ) and what they tell us about confinement .",
    "it will be seen that from this perspective the confinement mechanisms for gluons , quarks , and colored composites show some distinctive features .",
    "another virtue of the presented approach is the fact that qcd green functions can be employed directly in hadron phenomenology .",
    "this opens up a road to the ambitious aim of verifying or falsifying confinement pictures experimentally .",
    "a property of qcd which can also be infered from the hadron spectrum is the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry .",
    "a correct description of this non - perturbative phenomenon within functional approaches requires that the chiral ward identities between green functions are respected , see _",
    "e.g. _ refs .",
    "schemes fulfilling this condition exist , and the resulting description of meson physics is impressingly successful ( although many properties of mesons still have to be understood ) .",
    "recently the possibility of an ab initio description of the nucleon in functional approaches to continuum quantum field theory has opened up , and my third lecture will describe the first few steps in such a direction .",
    "the confinement problem has proven to be notoriously difficult , see _",
    "e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein for a brief review of ( some of ) the currently investigated theories of confinement . to mention two reasons out of many",
    "why the confinement problem is especially hard to solve let me first remark that the length scale of confinement is a physical scale . based on renormalization group ( rg ) considerations one can then conclude that there has to exist an rg invariant confinement scale which is related to the renormalization scale @xmath0 via the @xmath1-function @xcite : @xmath2 this relation clearly shows that the confinement scale possesses an essential singularity in the coupling constant @xmath3 .",
    "therefore it is not accessible in perturbation theory , and confinement can not be described perturbatively .",
    "in addition , as anticipated and also verified in the course of these lectures , confinement is related to infrared singularities .",
    "numerical lattice monte - carlo calculations are always restricted to finite volumes , and infrared properties can only be investigated by carefully studying the infinite volume limit . from this remark",
    "it is obvious that , to complement the lattice approach , a _",
    "non - perturbative continuum _",
    "approach is highly desirable if one aims at an understanding of confinement .        to obtain confinement the least requirement on the fundamental fields of qcd",
    "is that they do not represent particles , or phrased otherwise , that they do not appear as asymptotic states in the @xmath4-matrix .    as a matter of fact ,",
    "some relations between different confinement scenarios become most transparent in a covariant formulation which includes the choice of a covariant gauge , of course .",
    "first we note that covariant quantum theories of gauge fields require indefinite metric spaces . abandoning the positivity of the representation space already implies to give up one of the axioms of standard quantum field theory . maintaining the much stronger principle of locality , gluon confinement",

    "there a semi - definite physical subspace can be defined as the kernel of the ( onto its positive frequency part projected ) field operator @xmath5 .",
    "the physical states @xmath6 fulfilling @xmath7 then correspond to ( equivalence classes of ) states in this subspace .",
    "covariance implies , besides transverse photons , the existence of longitudinal and timelike ( `` scalar '' ) photons in qed .",
    "the latter two form metric partners in the indefinite space : they cancel against each other in every @xmath4-matrix element and therefore do not contribute to observables . to be more precise : the unphysical states have to be kept when inserting a complete unity ( in the language of feynman diagrams , in loops ) .",
    "they destructively interfere in between amplitudes ( _ i.e. _ feynman diagrams ) containing these states as asymptotic states ( _ i.e. _ external lines ) .",
    "a simple example of such feynman diagrams is given in fig.[photons ] .",
    "in qcd cancelations of unphysical degrees of freedom in the @xmath4-matrix also occur but are more complicated due to the self - interaction of the gluons , transverse gluons scatter into longitudinal ones and vice versa . in perturbation theory one obtains _ e.g. _ amplitudes for the scattering of two transverse into one transverse and one longitudinal gluons to order @xmath8 .",
    "a consistent quantum formulation in a functional integral approach leads to the introduction of ghost fields @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite . to order @xmath8",
    "a ghost loop then cancels all gluon loops which describe scattering of transverse to longitudinal gluons .",
    "the proof of this cancelation to all orders in perturbation theory has been possible by employing the brst symmetry of the covariantly gauge fixed theory  @xcite . at this point one",

    "the semi - definite physical subspace @xmath23 is defined on the basis of this algebra by those states which are annihilated by the brst charge @xmath17 , @xmath24 . since @xmath25 ,",
    "this subspace contains the space @xmath26 of so - called daughter states @xmath27 which are images of their parent states in @xmath28 . a physical hilbert space is then obtained as the space of equivalence classes , the brst cohomology of states in the kernel modulo those in the image of @xmath17 , @xmath29 this hilbert space is isomorphic to the space of brst singlets .",
    "all states are either brst singlets or belong to quartets , this exhausts all possibilities .",
    "this generalization of the gupta - bleuler condition on physical states , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath30 , eliminates half of these metric partners from all @xmath4-matrix elements ( leaving unpaired states of zero norm which do not contribute to any observable ) .",
    "are the transverse gluons also part of a brst quartet ?",
    "are gluons confined this way as conjectured in refs .",
    "@xcite ? before we return to this question it is illustrative to have a closer look into the issue of gauge fixing .",
    "[ gribov ]      a detailed illustration of the issue of the non - uniqueness of gauge fixing @xcite has been given in the lectures by dan zwanziger @xcite .",

    "illustrated in fig .  2 a gauge orbit intersects @xmath32 several times and therefore gauge fixing is not unique .",
    "the so - called minimal landau gauge obtained by minimizing @xmath33 along the gauge orbit is usually employed in corresponding lattice calculations , it restricts the gauge fields to the gribov region @xmath34 where the faddeev operator @xmath35 is strictly positive definite .",
    "phrased otherwise : on the boundary of the gribov region , the gribov horizon , the faddeev operator possesses at least one zero mode .",
    "unfortunately this is not the whole story .",
    "there are still gribov copies contained in @xmath36 @xcite , therefore one needs to restrict the gauge field configuration space even further to the region of global minima of @xmath33 which is called the fundamental modular region .",
    "a lot of effort has been devoted to an estimate of the corresponding effects in lattice studies , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "these provided evidence that for green functions of lattice gauge theory the effects due to gribov copies are not too large .",
    "the situation may be even better for the continuum field theory : from an approach using stochastic quantisation zwanziger argued that gribov copies inside the gribov region have no effect on the green functions of the theory @xcite .",
    "what remains to be implemented within a functional approach in continuum field theory is to cut off the functional integral over gauge fields at the boundary @xmath37 as already suggested by gribov .",
    "the solution has been found by zwanziger @xcite : one has to require that the ghost propagator is more singular in the infrared than a simple pole , @xmath38      in the covariant gauge confinement depends on the realization of the unfixed global gauge symmetries .",
    "the identification of the brst singlets with color singlets is possible only if the charge of global gauge transformations is brst exact _ and _ unbroken , _ i.e. _ , well - defined in the whole of the indefinite metric space @xmath28 .",
    "then brst singlets are the physical states and are thus constituting the physical hilbert space @xmath39 .",
    "the sufficient conditions for this are provided by the kugo - ojima criterion @xcite : the current @xmath40 is globally conserved , @xmath41 , and its two terms are of the form of a total derivative .",
    "the first term corresponds to a coboundary with respect to the space - time exterior derivative while the second term is a brst coboundary .",
    "the corresponding charges are denoted by @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively , @xmath44 for the first term herein there are only two possibilities , it is either ill - defined due to massless states in the spectrum of the field operator @xmath45 , or else it vanishes .    in qed massless photon states",
    "contribute to the analogues of both currents in  ( [ globg ] ) , and both charges on the r.h.s .  in ( [ globc ] )",
    "are separately ill - defined .",
    "one can employ an arbitrariness in the definition of the generator of the global gauge transformations ( [ globc ] ) to multiply the first term by a suitable constant such that these massless contributions cancel .",
    "this way one obtains a well - defined and unbroken global gauge charge which replaces the nave definition in ( [ globc ] ) .",
    "there are two independent structures in the globally conserved gauge currents in qed which both contain massless photon contributions .",
    "these can be combined to yield one well - defined charge as the generator of global gauge transformations leaving any other combination spontaneously broken , such as the displacement symmetry which leads to the identification of the photon with massless goldstone bosons @xcite .    in case",
    "the term @xmath45 contains no massless discrete spectrum , _ i.e. _ , if there is no massless particle pole in the fourier transform of transverse gluon correlations , one obtains @xmath46 .",
    "in particular , this is the case for channels containing massive vector fields , _",
    "i.e. _ in theories with higgs mechanism .",
    "it is expected to be also the case in any color channel of qcd with confinement for which it actually represents one of the two conditions formulated by kugo and ojima . in both these situations",
    "the brst exact charge is @xmath47 the second of the two conditions for confinement is that this charge be well - defined in the whole of the indefinite metric space @xmath28 .",
    "together these conditions are sufficient to establish that all brst singlet physical states in @xmath39 are also colour singlets , and that all coloured states are thus subject to the quartet mechanism .",
    "the second condition thereby provides the essential difference between higgs mechanism and confinement .",
    "the operator @xmath48 determining the charge @xmath43 will in general contain a _ massless _ contribution from the elementary quartet due to the asymptotic field @xmath49 in the antighost field which is defined in the ( weak ) asymptotic limit : @xmath50 . in the resulting relation @xmath51 the dynamical parameters",
    "@xmath52 determine the contribution of the massless asymptotic state to the composite field operator @xmath53 .",
    "these parameters can be obtained in the limit @xmath54 from the euclidean correlation functions of this composite field , _",
    "e.g. _ ,    @xmath55    the theorem by kugo and ojima asserts that all @xmath56 are well - defined in the whole of @xmath28 ( and do not suffer from spontaneous breakdown ) , if and only if @xmath57 then the massless states from the elementary quartet do not contribute to the spectrum of the current in @xmath43 , and the equivalence between physical brst singlet states and color singlets is established .    within the described mechanism the physical state space of yang - mills theory contains only colourless states .",
    "the coloured states are not brst singlets and therefore do not appear in @xmath4-matrix elements , they are unobservable . in the following",
    "i will provide evidence that the transverse gluons are brst quartet states with gluon - ghost , gluon - antighost and gluon - ghost - antighost states in the same multiplet .",
    "gluon confinement then occurs as kind of destructive interference between amplitudes ( _ i.e. _ feynman diagrams ) containing these states as asymptotic states ( _ i.e. _ external lines ) . the members of quartets are frequently said to be `` confined kinematically '' .",
    "this brst quartet mechanism can be summarized as follows :    * perturbatively , just as in qed , one such quartet , the elementary quartet , is formed by the massless asymptotic states of longitudinal and timelike gluons together with ghosts and antighosts which are thus all unobservable . *",
    "non - perturbatively , and in contrast to qed , however , the quartet mechanism also applies to transverse gauge field , _ i.e. _ gluon , states .",
    "a violation of positivity ( see the next subsection ) for such states then entails that they are also unobservable .    in landau gauge a sufficient criterion for relation ( [ ko1 ] ) and",
    "thus for this type of confinement to occur is given by the infrared behaviour of the ghost propagator : if it is more singular than a simple pole the kugo - ojima confinement criterion is fulfilled @xcite .",
    "note that _",
    "e.g. _ in maximally abelian gauge the kugo  ojima scenario is not applicable @xcite and thus one does not expect the ghost propagator to be ir enhanced .",
    "this has been recently confirmed in lattice calculations @xcite .      given these considerations",
    "it is obvious that if states with transverse gluons violate positivity these states do not belong to @xmath58 and are thus not physical states .",
    "one had to conclude that the transverse gluons belong to a brst quartet ( together with a gluon - ghost , a gluon - antighost , and a 2-gluon state ) .",
    "therefore it is sufficient to show positivity violation in the gluon propagator to prove this kind of gluon confinement .    at this stage",
    "it is interesting to point out that more than 25 years ago the contradiction between antiscreening of gluons ( and thus asymptotic freedom ) on the one hand and positivity of the gluon propagator on the other hand has been noted @xcite . in qcd in linear covariant",
    "gauges one obtains the following relation for the spectral sum rule of gluon correlation function @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the one - particle contribution , @xmath61 is the gluon renormalization constant and @xmath62 its corresponding anomalous dimension . due to",
    "antiscreening @xmath63 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath64 , and therefore one has to conclude that @xmath65 for some values of @xmath66 .",
    "this means nothing else than positivity violation in the gluon propagator . however , what is needed to compellingly demonstrate such a positivity violation is to verify these arguments beyond perturbation theory .",
    "there is another important issue which is also related to the question of positivity : how is the cluster decomposition theorem circumvented in yang - mills theory ? including the indefinite metric spaces of covariant gauge theories this theorem can roughly be summarized as follows @xcite : for the vacuum expectation values of the local product of two field operators @xmath67 and @xmath68 , being at a large spacelike separaration @xmath69 of each other , one obtains the following bounds depending on the existence of a finite gap @xmath70 in the spectrum of the mass operator @xcite @xmath71 for @xmath72 .",
    "herein , positivity entails that @xmath73 , but a positive integer @xmath74 is possible for the indefinite state space of gauge theories .",
    "therefore , in order to avoid the decomposition property for products of unobservable operators @xmath67 and @xmath68 which together with the kugo - ojima criterion is equivalent to avoiding the decomposition property for colored clusters , there should be no mass gap in the indefinite space @xmath28 .",
    "of course , this implies nothing on the physical spectrum of the mass operator in @xmath39 which certainly should have a mass gap .",
    "in fact , if the cluster decomposition property holds for a product @xmath75 forming an observable , it can be shown that both @xmath67 and @xmath68 are observables themselves .",
    "this then eliminates the possibility of scattering a physical state into color singlet states consisting of widely separated colored clusters ( the `` behind - the - moon '' problem ) @xcite .",
    "it has to be noted that the kugo - ojima criterion implies the absence of a massless particle pole in the color charge operator , and therefore in @xmath76 .",
    "this shows that the unphysical massless `` excitations '' which are necessary to avoid the cluster decomposition property are not the transverse gluons .    in the following compelling evidence for the above described aspects of qcd in the covariant gauge , and",
    "thus for this kind of gluon confinement , will be presented .",
    "it has to be emphasized , however , that this description is purely ` kinematical ' , _ i.e. _ nothing is stated about the dynamics of confinement .",
    "[ dses ]    the tool which will be employed to study the above raised questions is the set of dyson",
    " schwinger equations ( dses ) . the ones for the propagators of landau gauge qcd are displayed in fig .",
    "one sees that the propagators couple to higher @xmath77-point functions which are in general unknown .",
    "thus the questions arises : what can be infered from these equations ?",
    "is it possible to derive exact results ?",
    "surprisingly the answer is : yes , if one is willing to accept some reasonable assumptions about the mathematical properties of green functions .",
    "[ ggv ]    it will be shown that the general properties of the ghost dyson - schwinger equation and one additional assumption , namely that qcd green s functions can be expanded in asymptotics series in the infrared , allow to prove the kugo - ojima confinement criterion and the gribov - zwanziger condition @xcite .",
    "the starting point is the non - renormalization of the ghost - gluon vertex in landau gauge to all orders in perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "it does not acquire an independent ultraviolet renormalization , and even more , it stays bare for vanishing out - going ghost momentum @xmath78 , _",
    "these properties have been verified non - perturbatively @xcite .",
    "due to this the ghost - gluon vertex can not be singular for vanishing momenta which has important consequences .    to fix the notation we note that in landau gauge the gluon and ghost propagators are parametrized by the two invariant functions @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively . in euclidean momentum space one",
    "has @xmath81 after renormalization these propagators depend also on the renormalization scale @xmath0 . furthermore assuming that the qcd green functions can be expanded in asymptotic series , _",
    "e.g.  _ , @xmath82 the integral in the ghost dyson ",
    "schwinger equation can be split in up in three pieces .",
    "the infrared integral is too complicated to be treated analytically .",
    "the ultraviolet integral , on the other hand , does not contribute to the infrared behaviour . as a matter of fact , it is the resulting equation for the ghost wave function renormalization which allows one to extract definite information @xcite without using any truncation or ansatz .",
    "the results are that the infrared behaviour of the gluon and ghost propagators is given by power laws , and that the exponents are uniquely related such that the gluon exponent is -2 times the ghost exponent .",
    "as we will see later on this implies an infrared fixed point for the corresponding running coupling .",
    "the signs of the exponents are such that the gluon propagator is infrared suppressed as compared to the one for a free particle , the ghost propagator is infrared enhanced : the infrared exponent of the ghost propagator is negative , @xmath83 .",
    "this exact inequality implies that the kugo - ojima confinement criterion and the gribov - zwanziger condition are both fulfilled .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that no truncation or specialized ansatz has been used to obtain this result .",
    "the one employed assumption , namely that one is allowed to expand green functions in asymptotic series , is not considered to be problematic . besides this only the general structure of ghost dse and multiplicative renormalizibility have been used .",
    "the fact that the ghost - gluon vertex is only subject to a finite renormalization turns out to be the property which makes the tower of dses tractable .",
    "given that the yang - mills propagators obey infrared power laws , can one determine the infrared exponents of higher @xmath77-point functions ?",
    "to this end the corresponding @xmath77-point dses have been studied in skeleton expansion , _",
    "i.e. _ a loop expansion using dressed propagators and vertices , and an asymptotic expansion has ben applied to all primitively divergent green functions @xcite .",
    "it turns out that in this expansion the green functions can only be infrared singular in the kinematical limit where all external momenta go to zero .",
    "thus to determine the degree of possible singularities it is sufficient to investigate the dses in the presence of only one external @xmath84 .",
    "as an example consider the dse for the three - gluon vertex . in fig .",
    "5 we see the full equation , in fig .  6",
    "an approximation in the lowest order of a skeleton expansion . in the presence of one ( small ) external scale",
    "the approximated dse has a selfconsistent power law solution given by @xmath85 .",
    "thus the vertex is strongly singular in the infrared .",
    "one can show by induction that this solution is also present if terms to arbitrary high order in the skeleton expansion are taken into account .",
    "therefore the skeleton expansion provides the correct infrared solution of the dses .",
    "[ 3gv ]     [ 3gs ]    the following general infrared ( ir ) behaviour for one - particle irreducible green functions with @xmath86 external ghost legs and @xmath87 external gluon legs can be derived : @xmath88 very recently it has been shown @xcite by exploiting dses and exact renormalization group equations that this ir solution is unique .",

    "the infrared solution described above verifies the infrared dominance of the gauge fixing part of the covariantly gauge fixed qcd action conjectured in ref .",

    "limit the location of the singularity closest to the origin is @xmath250  mev when using the dse solution and 390 mev when adjusting to lattice data .",
    "this then implies finally a  range  of quark propagator parameterizations to be used .    as the parameterization of ref .",
    "@xcite is based on dse solutions and/or lattice data with different values of the current mass the dependence of the quark propagator functions on the current masses is kept quite precisely .",

    "[ massfunction ]      in an on - going investigation @xcite the two - quark scattering kernel @xmath243 is calculated for the complex momenta needed in the faddeev equation .",
    "the results presented here are , however , calculated using a further approximation , namely by representing the two - quark correlation function in terms of a sum over separable correlations , @xmath251 which is pictorially shown in fig .  23 .",
    ".,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] [ diquarks ]    hereby @xmath252 denotes the diquark propagator and @xmath253 the diquark amplitudes .",
    "the sum extends over scalar and axial - vector correlations . for the amplitudes we take into account the corresponding leading dirac structures @xmath254 with @xmath255 being the charge conjugation dirac matrix .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath256 , reflecting the non - pointlike structure of quark - quark correlations , are determined from an  on - shell  bethe - salpeter equation for the quark pair . in this way",
    "the confined nature of `` diquarks '' is not taken into account , and one obtains masses for the `` diquarks '' . in the chiral limit ,",
    "depending on the quark propagator parameterization , one obtains @xmath257 gev , @xmath258 gev . the quark pole mass and the diquark masses as a function of the current mass are plotted in fig .",
    "[ massensweep - dq ]     [ dqprop2.eps ]    given the knowledge about the diquark bsas and the diquark masses the diquark propagator can be quite accuratelly represented by the sum of a constant and a quark loop , see fig .",
    "the constant is hereby chosen such that the correct `` diquark msss '' is reproduced .      plugging the separable approximation for the two - quark scattering kernel @xmath243 into the faddeev equation leads to a coupled set of quark - diquark bethe - salpeter equations which is best formulated for the the vertex functions @xmath259 related to the bsas via @xmath260 the quark - diquark bethe - salpeter equations then read : @xmath261     [ q - dq - bse ]    the interaction between the spectator quark and the correlated quark - quark pair is quark exchange , which is also the least interaction required to reinstate the pauli principle .",
    "this interaction is attractive as antisymmetrisation in colour requires the symmetrisation in all other quantum numbers .",
    "the bethe - salpeter vertex function for the nucleon can be decomposed into @xmath262    @xmath263     + with constraints on the dirac matrices @xmath264 such that    * the nucleon has spin @xmath265 , positive parity and positive energy .",
    "* the two independent momenta * * = baryon momentum , and * * = quark - diquark relative momentum , + are basis vectors .",
    ".the partial wave decomposition of the nucleon in its rest frame . [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]      [ kappa ]    the absolute value of the magnetic moments is also too large . in addition to look at the isoscalar and isovector values one can compare directly to an estimate without pions @xcite , see table  iii , which is quite favourable for the interpretation of having mostly missed the pion cloud .",
    "plotting the anomalous magnetic moments against the pion mass and comparing to corresponding results from lattice data and their chiral extrapolation @xcite provides further evidence for this interpretation .",
    "the nucleons mass , electromagnetic form factors , charge radii and magnetic moments have been calculated in a poincar covariant faddeev approach    * employing dressed quarks and `` diquarks '' , obtained from the quark dse and diquark bse ( the corresponding propagators agree with lattice data where available . ) * as well as using dressed quark- and diquark - photon vertex functions . * the results describe the nucleons quark core without pion contributions and are obtained * * without model parameters * , the only input scale is @xmath152 ( @xmath266 into dses , @xmath267 or @xmath268 in lattice calculations ) .",
    "in these lectures i have attempted to demonstrate the progress made within functional approaches to strong continuum qcd and its application to hadronic physics .",
    "of course , further improvements are possible and highly desirable at every step of these investigations .    within landau gauge a consistent qualitative picture for all qcd propagators and vertex functions has emerged .",
    "first results within coulomb gauge , see also the lectures by dan zwanziger , allow for a first more general interpretation of the results .",
    "the importance of the gribov horizon in both gauges can possibly give a hint about the nature of confining field configurations .",
    "besides the fundamental issues of confinement and dynamical generation of masses qcd green functions can serve as a first - principles input into a description of hadronic properties .",
    "the ideal calculations of this kind have the minimal parameter set of qcd and make real predictions .",
    "the results obtained so far allow for the optimistic view that a coherent description of hadronic states and processes based on the dynamics of confined quarks and yang - mills fields can be realized in the near future .",
    "hereby different methods based on the qcd green functions will yield complementary information .",
    "lattice calculations provide evidence that truncations of the infinite hierarchy of dyson ",
    "schwinger and/or renormalization group equations have been done reasonably . on the other hand , results based on the full set of these equations as well as on truncated equations help to understand the lattice data .",
    "to explain confinement is one of the truly fundamental challenges to contemporary physics .",
    "understanding confinement will allow us to link the microscopic degrees of freedom of qcd , the quarks and gluons , to the measurable strong interactions in hadronic and nuclear physics .",
    "as long as the confinement phenomenon stays mysterious the standard model of particle physics lacks an important part , something essential in the fundamental laws of nature is then still unknown to us .",
    "although _ infrared qcd _ has posed us extremely challenging problems it is worth pursuing its research .",
    "the work reported was done in collaboration with a number of colleagues and students .",
