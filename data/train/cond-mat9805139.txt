    "numerical simulations sometimes are not a very efficient tool for studying systems with complex phase diagrams where an analytical control of the phase behavior of the system would be very helpful .",
    "if one is not interested in the critical behavior of the system , a very useful generalization of mean field methods for studying the phase diagram of spin systems is given by the cluster variation method ( cvm ) @xcite .",
    "this method generally gives a very accurate description of the phase diagram that can be appreciated when a comparison is possible with exact or monte carlo results @xcite .",
    "it has been extensively used for the calculation of equilibrium thermodynamics properties of spin models .",
    "the cvm is based on the application of the variational principle of the statistical mechanics with the simplification that the density matrix of the system is factorized over clusters inside which the system is treated exactly .",
    "the size of these cluster , sometimes called `` maximal clusters '' , depends on the accuracy requested and on the necessity of including all the interaction of the system and of reproducing the structure of the ground - states .",
    "correlation functions have been calculated in the framework of cvm approximation only in few simple cases .",
    "some properties of the pair correlation function of the two - dimensional ising model have been studied in the pair ( bethe ) and plaquette approximation levels of the cvm @xcite .",
    "the cvm has been also applied to the study of the correlation function in the disordered phase of the two - dimensional annni ( axial next nearest neighbors ising ) model @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a procedure for the calculation of correlation functions that can be generally applied to any choice of maximal cluster in the cvm scheme .",
    "it can be also implemented in numerical calculations together with the natural iteration method @xcite which is a numerical minimization procedure very convenient for calculating the maximal cluster density matrix in the most complex cases . in particular",
    "we apply our procedure to study the behavior of the pair correlation functions in the paramagnetic phase of the ising model with nearest neighbors ( nn ) , next - to - the - nearest neighbors ( nnn ) , and plaquette ( p ) interactions in two and three dimensions . in three dimensions , the phase diagram of this model",
    "can be correctly studied by implementing the cvm cube approximation with 8 independent site magnetizations in order to take into account the complex ground - state structure .",
    "our goal will be to calculate the pair correlation function in the same approximation used for the phase diagram .    the model with nn , nnn and p interactions has the same hamiltonian of the symmetric two - dimensional eight - vertex model @xcite .",
    "in three - dimensions this model is interesting also because it constitutes a realization of interacting random surfaces on a lattice @xcite .",
    "indeed , the peierls interfaces between domains of different sign can be interpreted as an ensemble of interacting surfaces with a boltzmann weight depending on the area , the mean curvature and the length of the intersection lines between the surfaces @xcite .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the phase diagram of this model , studied in mean field approximation , can well describe the phase diagram of experimental systems like fluid mixtures of water , oil and surfactant or other complex fluids .",
    "recently , the model with nn , nnn and p interactions has been also put in relation with string theory and in particular with a discretized string model ( the so - called gonihedric model ) characterized by a zero energy cost for the area of surfaces @xcite . the cvm cube approximation has been applied to the study of the phase diagram of the model with nn , nnn and p interactions in the parameter region corresponding to the gonihedric model @xcite .",
    "a question of particular interest in the phase diagram of models with competing interactions is the behavior of the pair correlation function in the paramagnetic phase . here ,",
    "generally , the so called `` disorder line '' separates a region where the pair correlation has the usual exponentially damped behavior from a region where the correlation develops an oscillatory exponentially damped behavior @xcite . in the case of the three - dimensional model with nn , nnn ,",
    "p interactions , this latter region can be identified with the microemulsion phase of surfactant systems which is a disordered phase but with an ordered structure on short length - scales @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this model , the possibility of calculating the correlation functions in the same cvm approximation used for the phase diagram is interesting also for some physical applications .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in sect .",
    "ii we briefly summarize the cvm procedure and discuss how correlation functions can be calculated . in sect .",
    "iii we consider the bidimensional eight - vertex model .",

    "in this section we first briefly describe the cvm approximation .",
    "we refer to the papers of refs . @xcite for further details",

    "suppose to have a spin hamiltonian defined on a given lattice as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the inverse of the temperature , @xmath2 is the interaction parameter for the cluster @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the product of spins @xmath5 on the sites @xmath6 .",
    "the first step of the cvm procedure is to choose a set of maximal clusters @xmath7 in which the system is treated exactly such that each cluster @xmath8 is included in one maximal cluster @xmath9 .",
    "then the cvm approximated free energy of the system can be expressed @xcite as the minimum of @xmath10 here the first sum is the internal energy of the system with the @xmath11 being variational parameters representing the expectation value of the multisite product of spins @xmath4 .",
    "the second term in the r.h.s of ( [ eq : genf ] ) is the entropy of the system and is a sum over all the clusters which are possible subclusters of the maximal clusters .",
    "the set of coefficients @xmath12 depends on the lattice structure and on the choice of the maximal cluster ; they can be easily found applying the eqs.(16 ) in the paper by an @xcite .",
    "the trace tr is the sum over the allowed configurations and @xmath13 is the density matrix for the cluster @xmath3 . in the case of ising spins @xmath14 one can write @xmath15 \\label{eq : rh}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the number of the sites in the cluster @xmath3 , the sum extends over all the subclusters @xmath1 of the cluster @xmath3 , and @xmath17 .",
    "a consequence of eq . ( [ eq : rh ] ) is that @xmath18 for a cluster @xmath19 .",
    "the parameters @xmath11 have to verify the minimization conditions @xmath20    in order to study the pair correlation function for a group of spins @xmath21 , it is convenient to introduce a local external field in the starting hamiltonian coupled to all clusters of the same type of @xmath22 . for one of these clusters",
    "the equilibrium condition becomes @xmath23 therefore the connected pair correlation function is given by @xmath24 where we have used the linear response theorem and the equilibrium conditions ( [ eq : equih ] ) .",
    "now , the free energy @xmath25 can be considered formally as a function of the independent variables @xmath26 instead of the @xmath27 .",
    "therefore the last term of the above equation can be evaluated through its inverse matrix that can be calculated by differentiating ( [ eq : equihgamma ] ) with respect to @xmath28 : @xmath29    once that the above matrix is obtained , its fourier transform can be simply inverted and will give the requested correlation function in fourier space .",
    "however , except that in the simplest cases , writing the matrix @xmath30 can be a complicate task from a computational point of view and requires some further considerations that we present here in a general way and that will become more transparent when applied to specific examples in the next sections .    in the matrix @xmath30 there appear generally derivatives like @xmath31 ( see , e.g. , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gamma - bruta],[eq : kappa_i ] ) ) where @xmath32 is a cluster of different type of @xmath3 .",
    "the evaluation of these derivatives can be performed by differentiating the state equations for @xmath11 with respect to @xmath26 .",
    "this procedure will give a system of linear equations @xmath33 in the variables @xmath31 .",

    "this procedure will be more clear and it will be shown in explicit cases in the next two sections .",
    "finally we observe that a great simplification occurs when we want to calculate the correlation function in the paramagnetic phase of a system with only even interactions . in this case only the derivatives @xmath31 , where @xmath3 and @xmath22 have both an odd ( or even ) number of sites , are different from zero .",

    "the plaquette density matrix @xmath43 can be calculated by minimizing the free energy ( [ eq : fplac - acca ] ) via the natural iteration equations @xcite ; then , after partial traces , one can work out the phase diagram of the system . in fig .",
