    "in 2005 miao @xcite proved a theorem generalizing the classic uniqueness result of bunting and masood - ul - alam @xcite for static black holes .",
    "this classic theorem proves that a time - symmetric slice of a static black hole , or more precisely a three - dimensional asymptotically flat riemannian manifold with a totally geodesic boundary where the killing vector vanishes , must be a time - symmetric slice of schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "miao was able to reach the same conclusion under much weaker assumptions , namely by replacing the conditions on the boundary from being totally geodesic and with vanishing killing to simply being minimal .",
    "as in bunting and masood - ul - alam s theorem , miao s result deals with static , time - symmetric and asymptotically flat initial data sets for vacuum . a key ingredient in miao s proof was to show that in such an initial data set , existence of a minimal surface implies the existence of a totally geodesic surface where the killing vector vanishes and moreover , that the given minimal surface must coincide with it .",
    "hence , the black hole uniqueness proof implies that the exterior of the minimal surface must coincide with the exterior of the time symmetric slice of schwarzschild spacetime outside the black hole .",
    "since for static , time - symmetric , vacuum slices the set of points where the killing vector vanishes is known to be a totally geodesic surface , the key step in miao s proof can be rephrased as saying that a minimal surface can not penetrate the exterior region where the killing vector is timelike .    in this paper",
    "we extend this result in three different directions .",
    "firstly we allow for non - vanishing matter as long as the null energy condition is satisfied .",
    "secondly , our initial data sets are no longer required to be time - symmetric . in this case",
    "the natural replacement for minimal surfaces is that of marginally outer trapped surfaces ( motss ) . and finally we relax the condition of asymptotic flatness to just assuming the presence of an asymptotically untrapped barrier ( defined below ) . in this general setting we prove two results , one for the stationary and one for the static case . in the stationary case , we show that any bounding mots satisfying a suitable reasonable property can not lie in the outer region where the killing vector is timelike .",
    "the precise statement is given in theorem [ theorem1 ] .",
    "in the static case we can strengthen this result and show that no bounding mots satisfying the same property can _ penetrate _ into the exterior region where the killing is timelike .",
    "the precise statement is given in theorem [ theorem2 ] .",
    "these results for motss also hold for weakly outer trapped surfaces .",
    "we emphasize that these results represent an extension of miao s uniqueness theorem in the following sense . in the case of",
    "static , time - symmetric , asymptotically flat and vacuum initial data sets , an untrapped barrier always exists and all the conditions in our theorems are automatically fulfilled .",
    "hence , existence of a minimal surface implies , from theorem [ theorem1 ] , that there must exist a surface of fixed points for the killing vector .",
    "secondly , the non - penetration property ( theorem [ theorem2 ] ) shows that the given minimal surface must coincide with this totally geodesic surface and then the bunting and masood - ul - alam black hole uniqueness proof applies to show that the region outside the minimal surface must be isometric to the time - symmetric slice of schwarzschild spacetime outside the black hole .",
    "theorem [ theorem1 ] also generalizes a result in @xcite where it was proven that strictly stationary spacetimes can not contain closed trapped nor marginally ( non - minimal ) trapped surfaces .",
    "notice that the definition of trapped or marginally trapped restricts _ both _",
    "null expansions of the surface , while weakly outer trapped surfaces only restrict one of them .",
    "the proof given by miao relies strongly on the vacuum field equations , so we must resort to different methods .",
    "the main technical tool that will allow us to extend miao s result in such generality is a recent powerful theorem by andersson and metzger @xcite , which asserts , roughly speaking , that the boundary of the weakly outer trapped region in initial data sets is either empty or a smooth marginally outer trapped surface .",
    "the existence of such an outermost surface in the minimal case was already known ( see @xcite and references therein ) and was in fact an important step in the proof by miao . with this generalization to the non - time - symmetric",
    "setting at hand , it is natural to ask whether miao s results also extend and in which sense .",
    "investigations involving stationary and static spacetimes have followed a general tendency over the years of relaxing global assumption in time and trying to work directly on slabs of spacetimes containing suitable spacelike hypersurfaces .",
    "this is particularly noticeable in black hole uniqueness theorems , where several conditions can be used to capture the notion of black hole ( not all of them immediately equivalent ) . in this paper , we follow this trend and work exclusively at the initial data level , without even assuming the existence of a spacetime containing it . in some circumstances the existence of such spacetime",
    "can be proven , for example by using the notion of killing development @xcite or by using well - posedness of the cauchy problem and suitable evolution equations for the killing @xcite .",
    "the former , however , fails at fixed points ( see below for the definitions ) and the second requires specific matter models , not just energy inequalities as we assume here .",
    "thus , at the level of generality we work on this paper , the existence of a spacetime can not always be guaranteed and dealing directly with initial data sets puts the problem into a more general setting . in particular , some of our results generalize known properties of static spacetimes to the initial data setting , which may be of independent interest .",
    "all the definitions we put forward are therefore stated in terms of initial data sets . however , since they are motivated by a spacetime point of view , we often explain briefly the spacetime perspective before giving the definition for the abstract initial data set .",
    "we finish the introduction with a brief summary of this work . in section [ preliminaries ]",
    "we define initial data set as well as killing initial data set .",
    "then we introduce the so - called killing form , give some of its properties and recall the definition of mots in terms of initial data sets . in section [ staticitykid ]",
    "we discuss the implications of imposing staticity on a killing initial data set and state a number of useful properties of the boundary of the set where the static killing vector is timelike , which will be important to prove our main theorems .",
    "some of the technical work required in this section is related to the fact that we are not a priori assuming the existence of an spacetime , and some of the results may be of independent interest .",
    "finally , section [ mainresults ] is devoted to stating and proving the two theorems discussed above on non - existence of motss in the outer timelike region , one for the stationary case and another for the static one .",
    "we start with the standard definition of initial data set ( throughout this paper latin indices run form 1 to 3 , greek indices run for 0 to 4 and boldface letters denote one - forms ) .",
    "an * initial data set * @xmath0 is a 3-dimensional connected manifold @xmath1 endowed with a riemannian metric @xmath2 , a symmetric , rank - two tensor @xmath3 , a scalar @xmath4 and a one - form @xmath5 satisfying @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the scalar curvature and @xmath8 the covariant derivative of @xmath2 and @xmath9 .    for simplicity , we will often write @xmath10 instead of @xmath11 when no confusion arises .    in the framework of the cauchy problem for the einstein field equations",
    ", @xmath1 is an embedded spacelike submanifold of a spacetime @xmath12 , @xmath2 is the induced metric and @xmath3 is the second fundamental form , which is defined as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the covariant derivative of @xmath15 , @xmath16 is a unit future directed normal one - form to @xmath1 and @xmath17 are arbitrary vector fields tangent to @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath18 . let @xmath19 be the einstein tensor of @xmath15 . the initial data energy density @xmath4 and energy flux @xmath20 are defined by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a basis vector field for @xmath23 .",
    "when @xmath24 and @xmath25 , the initial data set is said to be * vacuum*.    as remarked in the introduction we will regard initial data sets as abstract objects on their own , independently of the existence of a spacetime , unless explicitly stated .",
    "consider now a spacetime @xmath12 admitting a local isometry generated by a killing vector field @xmath26 , i.e. @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the lie derivative along @xmath29 and let @xmath10 be an initial data set in this spacetime .",
    "we can decompose @xmath26 along @xmath1 into a normal and a tangential component as @xmath30 where @xmath31 . inserting this into the killing equations and performing a 3 + 1 splitting on @xmath10 it follows ( see @xcite , @xcite ) , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the ricci tensor of @xmath2 , @xmath34 are the remaining components of the einstein tensor and @xmath35 .",
    "thus , the following definition of killing initial data becomes natural @xcite .",
    "an initial data set @xmath11 endowed with a scalar @xmath36 , a vector @xmath37 and a symmetric tensor @xmath38 satisfying equations ( [ kid1 ] ) and ( [ kid2 ] ) is called a * killing initial data * _ ( kid)_.    in particular , if a kid has @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath39 then it is said to be a * vacuum kid*.    a point @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is called a * fixed point*. this name is motivated by the fact that when the kid is embedded into a spacetime with a local isometry , the corresponding killing vector @xmath26 vanishes at @xmath43 and the isometry has a fixed point there .    a natural question regarding kids is whether they can be embedded into a spacetime @xmath12 such that @xmath36 and @xmath37 correspond to a killing vector @xmath26 .",
    "the simplest case where existence is guaranteed involves `` transversal '' kids , i.e. when @xmath44 everywhere .",
    "then , the following spacetime , called _ killing development _ of @xmath45 , can be constructed @xmath46 where @xmath47 notice that @xmath48 is a complete killing field with orbits diffeomorphic to @xmath49 which , when evaluated on @xmath50 decomposes as @xmath51 , in agreement with ( [ killingdecomposition ] ) .",
    "the killing development is the unique spacetime with these properties .",
    "further details can be found in @xcite .",
    "notice also that the killing development can be constructed for any connected subset of @xmath1 where @xmath52 everywhere .",
    "a useful object in spacetimes with a killing vector @xmath26 is the two - form @xmath53 , usually called * killing form * or also papapetrou field .",
    "this tensor will play a relevant role below .",
    "since we intend to work directly on the initial data set , we need to define a suitable tensor on @xmath10 which corresponds to the killing form whenever a spacetime is present .",
    "let @xmath54 be a kid in @xmath12 . clearly we need to restrict and decompose @xmath53 onto @xmath54 and",
    "try to get an expression in terms of @xmath36 and @xmath37 and its spatial derivatives . in order to use ( [ killingdecomposition ] )",
    "we first extend @xmath55 to a neighbourhood of @xmath1 as a unit and hypersurface orthogonal , but otherwise arbitrary , vector field ( the final expression we obtain will be independent of this extension ) , and define @xmath36 and @xmath37 so that @xmath37 is orthogonal to @xmath55 and ( [ killingdecomposition ] ) holds .",

    "we recall that @xmath8-covariant derivatives correspond to spacetime covariant derivatives projected onto @xmath1 .",
