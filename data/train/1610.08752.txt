    "in the last decades , a lot of attention has been dedicated to understanding how the macroscopic elasticity of polymer hydrogels is controlled by the properties of single polymer strands and by network disorder .",
    "most of these studies  @xcite have focussed on the case of filamentous networks , in which the constitutive polymers have persistence lengths @xmath0 larger that the network mesh size @xmath1  which is relevant to many biopolymers .",
    "they have shown , in particular , that large chain stiffnesses give rise to spectacular mechanical responses , such as pre - stress - induced stiffening or softening , negative normal stress , etc .",
    "few works  @xcite , however , have addressed recently the case  which is relevant to many hydrogels , such as gelatin or synthetic polymer gels  where the persistence length @xmath0 of polymer strands lies in an intermediate range between the monomer size @xmath2 and the mesh size @xmath1 .",
    "the elasticity of such `` flexible polymer networks '' is usually treated in the framework of the classical theory of rubber elasticity , which suggests that their shear modulus is @xmath3 ( in 3d ) .",
    "this expression is often used in practice to estimate network mesh - sizes from measurements of the shear modulus , but only arises from approximate scaling arguments  @xcite , or from a mean - field theory  @xcite where the end - to - end distances of chain segments are supposed to follow the same gaussian statistics as if they were independent .",
    "this assumption overlooks the fact that chains fluctuate around a state of mechanical equilibrium ; as we shall see , it amounts to a very stringent ansatz about the correlations between end - to - end and contour lengths .    in this paper , we study in detail how the distribution of contour lengths and the high - stretch stiffening of individual chain segments affect the macroscopic shear modulus .",
    "we address these issues using a 2d numerical model of gel , in which disorder is introduced by varying the contour lengths of polymer strands that form a triangular network .",
    "the model takes into account the existence of excluded volume effects  la flory - rehner  @xcite , and is tested for different expressions of the single chain response to large extensions .",
    "the shear modulus of such a system can be decomposed into a sum of three terms : @xmath4 which are respectively the opposite of the chain pressure @xmath5 , the elastic `` constant '' @xmath6 , and the non - affine term @xmath7 .",
    "even though the respective importance of these three terms depends on disorder strength and swelling level as well as on the importance of stretch - stiffening , we show that , in the range of parameter values relevant for usual flexible gels , these three contributions are ordered according to the following hierarchy : @xmath8 .",
    "namely , the non - affine contribution to the shear modulus is small enough for the born approximation @xmath9 to provide , for all practical purposes , a very satisfactory estimate of the shear modulus .",
    "the elastic constant @xmath6 contributes at most a fraction of @xmath10 less than typically 1520% and is all the weaker that the persistence length is small .",
    "the chain pressure term is always dominant , but its value depends on both the distribution of chain segment stiffnesses and on the accomodation of elastic disorder by mechanical equilibration .",
    "this hierarchy of the contributions is specific to flexible polymer gels , in constrast with semi - flexible or rigid polymer networks .",
    "we choose to specialize to 2d networks with a fixed , triangular topology , as illustrated on fig .  [",
    "fig : pictures ] . the nodes represent permanent crosslinks and the links flexible polymer strands that rotate freely at the nodes .",
    "the number of monomers on the strand connecting nodes @xmath11 and @xmath12 is denoted @xmath13 .",
    "we define the system free - energy as @xmath14 , where the two terms account respectively for : + ( i ) the elastic free - energy of individual strands in an ideal solvent , @xmath15 where the sum runs over all strands @xmath16 , with @xmath17 the distance between nodes @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and the subscript @xmath18 in @xmath19 accounts for its dependence on @xmath13 .",
    "+ ( ii ) a flory - rehner - like contribution  @xcite that accounts for excluded volume effects . to model it",
    ", we consider that the number of monomers lying in a given network triangle @xmath20 is @xmath21 .",
    "the average monomer concentration in a network triangle is thus @xmath22 with @xmath23 the triangle area . in the spirit of the flory - rehner mean - field approximation  @xcite , we then set : @xmath24 where the sum runs over all triangles , and @xmath25 is the 2d excluded volume parameter .",
    "now we need to specify the expression of the elastic free - energy @xmath19 of individual chains that enters equation  ( [ eq : fch ] ) .",
    "we consider that the persistence length @xmath0 is small compared with the average mesh size .",
    "so long as the end - to - end distance @xmath17 of any strand is much smaller than its contour length @xmath26 , elasticity is purely entropic , and we can use for @xmath19 the standard gaussian expression  @xcite : @xmath27 it is well - known , however , that this expression is insufficient at high stretch , i.e. when @xmath28 approaches 1 .    a standard model for the large stretch response is the freely jointed chain  @xcite , for which the relation between elongation and applied force is provided , in 3d , by a langevin function .",
    "although the associated free - energy does not possess an explicit analytic expression , a satisfactory approximation is provided by the cohen expression  @xcite , which interpolates between the small stretch ( @xmath29 ) gaussian and the nearly taut ( @xmath30 ) limits . in appendix",
    "[ app : fjc ] we derive the analogous expression for a 2d freely - jointed chain containing @xmath31 kuhn segments ; it reads : @xmath32 with @xmath33 as needed , @xmath34 reduces to the gaussian expression in the limit @xmath29 .",
    "it is known that the logarithmic growth of the freely - jointed chain free - energy underestimates the hardening of the single chain response at high stretch levels .",
    "this effect certainly becomes all the more important that the persistence length increases and , in the limit of high stiffnesses , the worm - like chain ( wlc ) model provides a much better description of the stretch - force relation . to tackle the problem of intermediate persistence lengths , blundell and terentjev  @xcite have proposed a model of the single chain response that interpolates between the gaussian and the wlc relations",

    "clearly @xmath70 in the initial configuration , where @xmath65",
    ".    the born approximation of affine deformation amounts to assuming that node positions vary with @xmath64 as @xmath71 with fixed antecedents that coincide with the initial node positions . to separate the affine and non - affine contributions to the elastic response",

    "this is realized by writing @xmath74 which defines @xmath75 .",
    "we are interested in the static elastic response , which entails that , under loading , the system remains at mechanical equilibrium , i.e. that the force on each node vanishes at all times : @xmath76 we denote @xmath77 the node positions at mechanical equilibrium under strain @xmath64 . in a disordered system , as @xmath64 varies , the @xmath77 follow trajectories that , in general , are not affine .",

    "since moreover , in the limit @xmath87 , @xmath86 tends to the initial ( reference ) configuration , it turns out that @xmath88 can be interpreted as the force induced by an infinitesimal affine deformation @xmath89  @xcite . in view of equation  ( [ eq : naff ] )",
    ", the non - affine displacement field characterized by @xmath90 can be interpreted as the linear elastic response of the system to this field of virtual forces .",
    "this framework can be used to write explicit expressions for stresses and elastic stiffnesses , which are first and second derivatives of the free - energy with respect to strain .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that elastic stiffnesses  @xcite , defined as @xmath91 with @xmath92 the system area , can be decomposed as  @xcite : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the born approximation for the stiffness tensor , which assumes that the nodes follow affine trajectories , and the non - affine contribution @xmath95 results from the non - affinity of the displacement field .      since @xmath14 ,",

    "since hydrogels are incompressible on time scales where poroelasticity is irrelevant , their elasticity is characterized , for all practical purposes , by their response to shear .",
    "we thus focus here on the case of simple shear deformation , for which @xmath101 in this case , the linear elastic response is characterized by the shear modulus @xmath102 , which , according to equations  ( [ eq : s])-([eq : na ] ) , can be decomposed into a born and a non - affine contributions .",

    "this observation sharply constrasts with the assumptions of rubber elasticity , which overlooks mechanical equilibration , and postulates that chains are independent , with a gaussian statistics for end - to - end vectors .",
    "it follows that @xmath197 is independent of @xmath13 , which leads to predicting a constant @xmath149 . since @xmath6",
    "[ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : c ] ) ] vanishes for gaussian chains , rubber elasticity predicts the shear modulus to be disorder - independent .",
    "let us now turn to panel  ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : bim ] , which displays the shear modulus along with the three terms of its decomposition @xmath183 . in all cases ,",
    "the chain pressure term @xmath198 provides the largest contribution .",
    "the elastic constant @xmath6 captures departures from gaussianity .",
    "it vanishes for gaussian chains .",
    "it remains weak for the fj model , is comparable to @xmath199 for the bt one , and in both cases grows with disorder strength .",
    "this latter effect results primarily from the fact that in both models @xmath200 is a concave function of @xmath128 , a property which is expected to hold rather generally for stretch - hardening chain free - energies . of course , like chain pressure , the exact value of @xmath6 in the fj and bt models depends on the correlations evidenced in fig .",
    "[ fig : bim : g ] between chain end - to - end distances and monomer numbers .",
    "yet , as we saw above , mechanical equilibration does not destroy the constrast of stretch ratios between short ( more taut ) and long chains , and hence the value of @xmath6 grows with disorder strength .",
    "the non - affine contribution @xmath7 also increases with disorder , as intuitively expected . yet , strikingly , it only contributes a small fraction of the shear modulus : @xmath201 remains smaller than 1% for both the gaussian and fj models ; it reaches at most @xmath202 for the highest disorder strength with the bt model .",
    "it thus turns out that the effect of disorder on the shear modulus is , for all practical purposes , captured by the born approximation : @xmath9 . as both terms grow similarly with disorder , so does the shear modulus @xmath10 .      in order to illustrate how disorder impacts the elastic response of the network to swelling , we compare on fig .",
    "[ fig : bim : swelling ] the swelling response of a @xmath57 network with its homogeneous ( @xmath151 ) counterpart , both using the bt model of chain free - energy . for pedagogical purposes",
    ", our swelling range extends up to a very high  of course unrealistic  level ( @xmath203 ) .",
    "all the measured quantities vary much more steeply with swelling level , in the disordered network .",
    "this can be ascribed to the hardening sensitivity of the short chains .",
    "for example , at @xmath203 , the end - to - end distances of shorts chains are strongly peaked around @xmath204 , which corresponds to a very high stretch ratio @xmath205 .",
    "by contrast , the long chains exhibit rather modest stretch ratios @xmath206 , their end - to - end distances being broadly distributed about @xmath207 .",
    "it is thus primarily the short chains that are responsible for the disordered - induced enhancement of stiffening with swelling .",
    "( color online ) dependence of network properties on the swelling level for the bt model , comparing the homogeneous @xmath151 network ( dot - dashed ) with a disordered network with @xmath57 ( solid ) .",
    "parameters : @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "here we have analyzed in detail the case of flexible networks , in which the persistence length @xmath0 remains substantially smaller than the contour length of inter - crosslinks polymer chain segments .",
    "their modulus can be decomposed into three terms , @xmath183 which present different sensitivities to chain flexibility and network disorder .",
    "we have shown that : + ( i ) the non - affine contribution vanishes in the limit of either very flexible ( gaussian ) chains or of homogeneous ( non - disordered ) networks . as a consequence , it contributes only a few percents of @xmath10 if we limit ourselves to a realistic range of disorder @xmath208 and swelling levels .",
    "hence , the shear modulus is very well captured by the born approximation : @xmath9 + ( ii ) the elastic constant @xmath6 vanishes in the limit of flexible ( gaussian ) chains , but is non - zero for stretch - hardening chains even in the absence of disorder .",
    "it thus presents values that are systematically larger that @xmath7 .",
    "however , it contributes only a small fraction of @xmath10 at reasonable disorder and swelling levels .",
    "+ ( iii ) in all cases , @xmath10 is dominated by the chain pressure contribution @xmath209 , all the more so that chains are more flexible .",
    "+ this hierarchy of importance between the three contributions ( @xmath8 ) is specific to flexible networks , in contrast with networks made of rigid polymers exhibiting finite average end - to - end distances on the scale of the mesh size @xmath1 .",
    "of course , the specific value of @xmath149 ( and of @xmath10 ) depends on both the distribution of chain stiffnesses and on the accomodation of this elastic disorder by mechanical equilibration .",
    "a trivial effect of disorder  captured in the regular network approximation , which assumes that crosslinks lie on a regular lattice  is that shorter ( stiffer ) chains tend to be more taut than long ( softer ) ones , which entails that disorder strongly enhances the stretch - hardening effects .",
    "mechanical equilibration mitigates this effect by introducing correlations between end - to - end distances and chain contour lengths .",
    "these joint effects bring in a noticeable contribution to @xmath10 even in the case of fully - flexible ( gaussian ) chains , in contradiction with the prediction of rubber elasticity .",
    "we are grateful to tristan baumberger for stimulating our interest in the subject and for illuminating discussions .",
    "we compute the 2d polymer entropic elasticity following the usual route . a chain is supposed to comprise @xmath128 monomers of size @xmath2 . to take into account the finite persistence length ,",
    "it is decomposed into @xmath210 kuhn segments of fixed size @xmath211 and orientation @xmath212 .",
    "the kuhn segments are attached at their end points and can rotate and overlap freely .",
    "one end of the polymer is held fixed , and a force @xmath213 is applied at the other , which amounts to introducing a potential @xmath214 , with @xmath215 the end - to - end vector . under equilibrium at temperature @xmath216 ,",
    "the partition function is @xmath217 with @xmath218 with @xmath219 and @xmath220 a modified bessel function of the first kind .",
    "the average end - to - end vector is : @xmath221 so that the norm of the end - to - end distance is @xmath222 , with @xmath223 .    in order to invert approximately this relation",
    ", we note that for small @xmath224 , at lowest order , @xmath225 , whence @xmath226 ; and for large arguments , @xmath227 , whence @xmath228 .",
    "the inverse relations , respectively @xmath229 ( when @xmath230 ) and @xmath231 ( when @xmath232 ) . in the spirit of the cohen approximation for the 3d case  @xcite , we interpolate between these two limits using the rational function @xmath233 .",
    "so we write @xmath234 . from this",
    ", we derive the expression for the elastic the free - energy @xmath235 of the freely jointed chain that appears in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fj ] ) : @xmath236 where @xmath211 and @xmath33",

    "it is convenient , for any vector @xmath240 to define @xmath241 ; also , we assume  without loss of generality  that all triangles are oriented counterclockwise , so that the area of a triangle reads @xmath242 .",
    "the force exerted on node @xmath11 can be decomposed into the contributions of both the chain and flory free - energies : @xmath243 the chain contribution @xmath244 is of the form : @xmath245 where the summation counts any pair once , and where @xmath246 denotes the force exerted by @xmath12 on @xmath11 : @xmath247 the last equation is newton s second law .",
    "the flory contribution reads : @xmath248 where @xmath249 is the force caused on node @xmath11 , by the three body interaction between nodes @xmath250 , @xmath251 and @xmath252 .",

    "thanks to the translation and rotation invariance of @xmath254 , the forces it induces on the summits verify : @xmath255 and @xmath256 with @xmath257 the vector product .",
    "the general expression for @xmath258 reads : @xmath259 with @xmath260      let us consider an arbitrary deformation @xmath64 .",
    "as in section  [ sec : naff ] , under the conditions of mechanical equilibrium , the nodes follow trajectories @xmath77 that are not identical in general to their affinely displaced values @xmath261 ; the non - affine displacements can be characterized by considering the zero strain antecedents : @xmath78 during deformation .",

    "the second term vanishes in the rhs since @xmath263 does , by definition of mechanical equilibrium , so that : @xmath264 this property , which is independent of the form of the total free - energy , states that the cauchy stress can be computed by considering that deformation is associated with affine displacements only , since the derivative is taken at fixed @xmath265 .",
    "the hessian matrix @xmath268 is needed to compute the non - affine displacement fields from eq .",

    "thus the hessian transform can be viewed a the series of two operations : a discrete gradient @xmath287 , followed by an operation denoted @xmath288 , which applies on the field of pair differences @xmath286 .",
    "this separation results from the fact that the free - energy function is only a function of the stretches @xmath286 .",
