    "if the response @xmath0 is very rare compared with the response @xmath1 , we are in presence of a rare event configuration also called class imbalance .",
    "this problem recently got computer scientists attention : they aimed at reducing computational costs by bypassing the class imbalance with resampling methods @xcite @xcite @xcite . with these methods , the variance in estimating model parameters increases",
    "statisticians are aware of this problem and complex procedures such as local case - control sampling were proposed @xcite ( a method initiated in epidemiology @xcite ) .    in a recent work ( 2007 ) by art b. owen @xcite , the opposite approach is considered : the class imbalance is infinitely increased in order to reach the theoretical distribution of the majority class observations .",
    "owen proved that under some overlap conditions the model parameters are finite ( apart from the intercept ) and built a limit system of equations related to exponential tilting , whose solution is the new estimate .",
    "the resulting equations include the distribution of the infinite class expressed through integrals , which are not easy to infer .",
    "this may explain that this work was broadly ignored ( the author found it when sections [ section2 ] and [ section3 ] were already completed ) .    in our approach ,",
    "the observations of the majority class are infinitely replicated and the owen s limit distribution becomes the observed distribution .",
    "this situation is a kind of degenerate case between resampling ( we repeat observations ) and infinitely class imbalance ( the observed distribution is chosen as the theoretical one ) . unlike owen",
    "s result , our limit normal equations can be interpretated as the first order conditions of a new likelihood .",
    "+ the idea of this work comes from the analysis of highly imbalanced binary spontaneous reports databases .",
    "such databases are gathered by many countries and institutions ( fda , mhra , who , ... ) .",
    "imbalanced logistic regression with binary predictors gives maximum likelihood estimate ( mle ) very close to its limit imbalanced counterpart .",
    "this result makes possible the study of lasso - type regularization problem and the development of effective algorithms to provide model selection .",
    "so far , only disproportionality methods are routinely used @xcite for spontaneous report databases : predictors are analysed one by one , leading to a great number of false positive signals @xcite .",
    "mathematical tools adjusted to binary data for regression are surprisingly barely developed by scientists ( only boolean matrices have been studied by some authors @xcite ) .",
    "this results in an inflation of empiric methods using lasso regularization in recent years ( from @xcite to @xcite ) .",
    "this is a worrying trend because recommendations made by these experts shift towards more complicated experimental methods and time - consuming algorithms , not towards a deeper mathematical understanding .",
    "this work is motivated by the need to better analyse this kind of applied problem .",
    "the paper contains three main sections in which we present the following results : +    * in section [ section2 ] , we investigate the properties of the logistic normal equations with binary predictors .",
    "simple existence and uniqueness conditions of silvapulle s type are found and some exact solutions presented .",
    "an invariance property in presence of intercept links this particular solution ( called `` square solution '' ) to the limit imbalanced problem .",
    "we then acquaint ourselves with the issue of variance inflation of the imbalanced problem by computing the fisher information . + * in section [ section3 ] , we derive owen - type equations with a first order term evaluating the convergence rate . for the limit system of equations ,",
    "the existence and uniqueness of the solution is proved with a new method leading to the minimization of a kullback - leibler divergence under linear constraints .",
    "a rescaling procedure on the initial likelihood and the previously found divergence justify the introduction of a rescaled likelihood corresponding to our limit imbalanced logistic regression problem . in a bayesian framework ,",
    "the jeffreys penalty does not significantly decrease the variance of the estimator but other more appropriate priors , such that exponential ones , could help to reduce it ( chosen according to the situation ) .",
    "the closeness in simulation between limit estimates and classical estimates compels us to go one step further with the study of regularization paths , in particular if the model is known to be sparse .",
    "+ * in section [ section4 ] , we look at a lasso regularization problem for the rescaled likelihood , which has a clear interpretation as a shift on the predictor means for the class of interest .",
    "we succeed in finding some path estimators in a few particular cases ( independence and orthogonal design ) . in presence of correlation , we present an effective path following algorithm by piecewise logarithmic functions giving precise estimates .",
    "we conclude by explaining the need of an analysis of the correlation structure between predictors .",
    "this leads to simple algorithmic procedures with small computational costs for which many different prior penalties could be easily tested .",
    "two examples are given using the french spontaneous reports database .",
    "+    the expressions `` infinitely imbalance '' and `` limit imbalance '' are considered as synonymous , although we recommend the use of the second one in our context due to the simple unique limit we impose and an analogy with hydrodynamic limits ( in fluid dynamics ) while the first expression is related to the underlying distribution introduced by owen .",
    "+ we conclude this article by discussing the many opportunities that arise with the introduction of a rescaled likelihood in a bayesian context and of the path following algorithm by logarithmic functions .",
    "the binary logistic regression ( blr ) problem consists in the determination of coefficients @xmath2 maximizing a smooth and concave likelihood function given by the relation @xmath3 where @xmath4 is indexed from zero with @xmath5 corresponding to the intercept . binary design matrices @xmath6 and @xmath7 with @xmath8 are of full rank : they aggregate the @xmath9 binary predictors .",
    "vectors of weights @xmath10 and @xmath11 save repetitions for distinct observations in response classes @xmath12 and @xmath13 separately .",
    "the binary structure favours repetitions in the sequence of observations , which justifies these notations .",

    "to conclude this section , we study the asymptotic behavior of the estimator for large @xmath117 and @xmath118 . since the mle ( intercept excluded ) remains the same with or without a class imbalance ( see the invariance property ) , we have a glimpse of a general property in class imbalance .",

    "notice that , with a result around @xmath136 , the approximate path is often very close to the exact one , this is due to close @xmath137 terms in the t sequence ( see ( [ tseq ] ) ) .",

    "a convergence study of all possible existing algorithms for the primal and dual problems could be performed with different class imbalances and an evaluation of the first order term .",
    "the variance reduction is a central issue that has to be treated in a bayesian framework .",

    "moreover , this algorithm can take into account the correlation structure between predictors to further shrink computational costs .",
    "the values for @xmath25 , @xmath142 and for matrix @xmath139 could be shifted in order to incorporate absolute bias , temporal bias , under - reporting and similarity or correlation corrections .",
