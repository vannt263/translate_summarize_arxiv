    "low - density - parity - check ( ldpc ) codes @xcite are special , not only because they can approach virtually error - free transmission limit , but mainly because a computationally efficient iterative decoding scheme , the celebrated belief propagation ( bp ) decoding , is readily available . for an idealized code on a tree , the bp algorithm is exactly equivalent to the symbol - map decoding , which is reduced to block - map ( or simply maximum likelihood , ml ) , in the asymptotic limit of infinite snr . for any realistic code",
    "( with loops ) , the bp algorithm is approximate , and it should actually be considered as an algorithm solving iteratively nonlinear equations , called bp equations .",
    "the bp equations describe extrema ( e.g. minima are of main interest ) of the bethe free energy @xcite . minimizing the bethe free energy , that is a nonlinear functional of the probabilities / beliefs , under the set of linear ( compatibility and normalization ) constraints , is generally a difficult task .",
    "linear programming decoding , introduced in @xcite , is a close relative of bp which can be viewed as a relaxed version of maximum likelihood ( ml ) decoding .",
    "relation of the lp decoding to the bethe free energy approach @xcite , and thus to bp equations and decoding , was noticed in @xcite , and the point was elucidated further in @xcite . in short , lp may be considered as large snr asymptotic limit of bp , where the later is interpreted as an extremum of the bethe free energy functional .",
    "both bp and lp are computationally efficient but suboptimal , i.e. incapable of matching performance of the maximum - likelihood ( ml ) .",
    "performance of an error - correcting scheme can be measured in terms of the frame error rate ( fer ) dependence on the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "fer decreases as snr increases .",
    "even though bp and lp decodings are suboptimal with respect to ml at all snrs , the difference in fer is only order one in the water - fall regime of small snrs .",
    "the situation becomes significantly worse in the error - floor domain of moderate to large snrs where fer for bp / lp is parametrically , i.e. orders of magnitude , larger than fer for ml .",
    "length of the error - correction code brings another dimension into the problem .",
    "the longer the code the lower is the value of fer where the water - fall - to - error - floor transition happens . on the other hand ,",
    "standard monte - carlo ( mc ) numerics is incapable to determine ber below @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , understanding and describing the error - floor by an alternative , and hopefully more insightful , method is in great demand @xcite .",
    "one such useful insight came through recent efforts @xcite to understanding error - floor in terms of the most probable of the dangerous configurations of the noise , so - called instantons , contributing most to fer .",
    "bp / lp decodes the instantons into the so - called non - codeword pseudo - codewords @xcite .",
    "it was recognized that for moderate and large snrs splitting of the two ( fer vs snr ) curves , representing ml decoding and approximate bp / lp decoding , is due to the pseudo - codewords , which are confused by the suboptimal algorithm for actual codewords of the code .",
    "describing bp / lp error - floor translates into finding pseudo - codewords with low effective distance .",
    "we discuss the instanton / pseudo - codeword approach in this presentation .",
    "the two main themes reviewed are instanton - amoeba @xcite and lp - based pseudo - codeword search ( pcs ) algorithms @xcite for finding low effective distance instantons / pseudo - codewords .",
    "instanton - amoeba , introduced in @xcite , is an efficient numerical scheme which finds instanton / pseudo - codeword by means of a simplex ( amoeba ) optimization .",
    "the algorithm is initialized with a random simplex and many sequential attempts are required to built the instanton / pseudo - codeword frequency spectra of the code .",
    "the scheme is ab - initio by construction , thus it requires no additional assumptions .",
    "it is also generic , in that there are no restrictions related to the type of decoding or channel .",
    "the instanton - amoeba method is general but also computational resources consuming .",
    "lp - based pseudo - codewords search ( pcs ) algorithm , suggested in @xcite , is an efficient alternative to the instanton - amoeba .",
    "formally , one step of the pcs constitute sequential repetition of the lp algorithm , where the entry information , log - likelihoods , are updated according to a feedback from the previous iteration in the sequence . like in the instanton - amoeba case",
    ", each step of the algorithm starts from a randomly selected configuration of the noise and ends at a low weight pseudo - codeword .",
    "pcs takes advantage of some special features of lp resulted in monotonicity of the procedure .",
    "we experimentally observed that effective distance of the result always decreases , or stays the same , after a single pcs circle .",
    "the two methods , instanton - amoeba and lp - based pcs , can also be viewed as complementary ingredients of one package aiming at exploring the error - floor domain .",
    "thus , results of the pcs algorithm can be naturally used as a starting guess for the instanton - amoeba and vice - versa .",
    "the material in the manuscript is organized as follows .",
    "relation between lp and bp decodings is elucidated , via the unifying bethe free energy approach , in section [ sec : bethe ] .",
    "we introduce the instanton - amoeba method in section [ sec : amoeba ] .",
    "lp - based pcs algorithm is described in section [ sec : pcs ] .",
    "simulation results demonstrating utility of the instanton - amoeba and the pcs algorithms are described in section [ sec : results ] . here",
    "we discuss @xmath1 $ ] and @xmath2 $ ] codes also presenting some monte carlo simulations .",
    "discussion of open problems , given in section [ sec : concl ] , concludes the presentation .",
    "we consider a generic linear code , described by its parity check @xmath3 sparse matrix , @xmath4 , representing @xmath5 bits and @xmath6 checks .",
    "the codewords are configurations , @xmath7 , which satisfy all the check constraints : @xmath8 , @xmath9 ( mod  @xmath10 ) .",
    "the codeword sent to the channel is polluted and the task of decoding becomes to restore the most probable pre - image of the output sequence , @xmath11 .",
    "probability for @xmath12 to be a pre - image of @xmath13 is @xmath14 where one writes @xmath15 if @xmath16 ; @xmath17 is the normalization coefficient ( so - called partition function ) ; the kronecker symbol , @xmath18 , is unity if @xmath19 and it is zero otherwise ; and @xmath20 is the vector of log - likelihoods dependent on the output vector @xmath21 . in the case of the awgn channel with the snr ratio , @xmath22 , bit transition probability is , @xmath23 , and the log - likelihood becomes , @xmath24 . the optimal block - map ( maximum likelihood )",
    "decoding maximizes @xmath25 over @xmath12 @xmath26 and symbol - map operates similarly , however in terms of the marginal probability at a bit @xmath27    bp and lp decodings should be considered as computationally efficient but suboptimal substitutions for map decodings .",
    "both decodings can be conveniently derived from the so - called bethe - free energy approach of @xcite which is briefly reviewed below .",
    "( see also @xcite . ) in this approach trial probability distributions , called beliefs , are introduced both for bits and checks , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "the set of bit - beliefs , @xmath30 , satisfy equality and inequality constraints that allow convenient reformulation in terms of a bigger set of beliefs defined on checks , @xmath31 , where , @xmath32 , is a local codeword associated with the check @xmath33 .",
    "the equality constraints are of two types , normalization constraints ( beliefs , as probabilities , should sum to one ) and compatibility constraints @xmath34 additionally all the beliefs should be non - negative and smaller than or equal to unity .",
    "the bethe free energy is defined as a difference of the self - energy and the entropy , @xmath35 : @xmath36 optimal configurations of beliefs minimize the bethe free energy subject to the equality constraints ( [ comp ] ) . introducing the constraints as the lagrange multiplier terms to the effective lagrangian and looking for the extremum with respect to all possible beliefs",
    "leads to @xmath37 where the set of @xmath38 fields ( which are lagrange multipliers for the compatibility constraints ) satisfy @xmath39 these are the bp equations for ldpc codes written in its standard form . these equations are often described in the coding theory literature as stationary point equations for the bp ( also called sum product ) algorithm and then @xmath38 variables are called messages .",
    "the bp algorithm , initialized with @xmath40 and iterating eqs .",
    "( [ eta ] ) sequentially from right to left , is exact on the tree .",
    "this is the bp algorithm discussed in the paper . however , let us notice for the sake of completeness , that even though significance of the bp equations for map decoding of actual codes ( with loops ) was established @xcite , the standard tree - motivated choice of the bp iterations scheduling is not obvious .",
    "possible lack of the iterative algorithm convergence ( to respective solution of the bp equation ) is a particular concern , and some relaxation methods were recently introduced to deal with the problem @xcite .",
    "lp is a close relative of bp which does not have this unpleasant problem with convergence .",
    "originally , lp decoding was introduced as a relaxation of ml decoding @xcite .",
    "( [ ml ] ) can be restated as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the polytope spanned by all the codewords of the code .",
    "looking for @xmath12 in terms of a linear combination of the codewords , @xmath43 : @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 , one observes that block - map turns into a linear optimization problem .",
    "lp - decoding algorithm of @xcite proposes to relax the polytope , expressing @xmath12 in terms of a linear combination of local codewords associated with checks , @xmath47",
    ". we will not give details of this original formulation of lp here , because we prefer an equivalent formulation elucidating connection to bp decoding .",
    "one finds that bp decoding , understood as an algorithm searching for a stationary point of the bp equations , turns into lp decoding in the asymptotic limit of large snr . indeed in this special limit the entropy terms in the bethe free energy can be neglected and the problem turns to minimization of a linear functional under a set of linear constraints .",
    "the similarity between lp and bp ( the later one identified with a minimum of the bethe free energy @xcite ) was noticed in @xcite and it was also discussed in @xcite . stated in terms of beliefs ,",
    "lp decoding minimizes the self - energy part ( [ e_bethe ] ) of the full bethe free energy functional under the set of linear equality constraints ( [ comp ] ) and also linear inequalities guaranteeing that all the beliefs are non - negative and smaller than or equal to unity .",
    "this gives us full definition of the so - called large polytope lp decoding .",
    "one can run it as is in terms of bit- and check- beliefs , however it may also be useful to re - formulate the lp procedure solely in terms of the bit beliefs . the small polytope formulation of lp is due to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "indeed , self - energy is stated only in terms of bit beliefs , and moreover one rewrites it just in terms of @xmath48 , excluding @xmath49 from the consideration .",
    "furthermore , one can also exclude check beliefs , replacing them by a set of inequality constraints imposed on @xmath50 .",
    "the later remain the only set of variables stayed in the small polytope formulation , @xmath51 : @xmath52",
    "goal of decoding is to infer the original message from the received output , @xmath13 . assuming that coding and decoding are fixed and aiming to characterize performance of the scheme , one studies frame - error - rate ( fer ) @xmath53 , where @xmath54 if an error is detected and @xmath55 otherwise . in symmetric channel fer",
    "is invariant with respect to the original codeword , thus all-@xmath56 codeword can be assumed for the input . when snr is large fer , as an integral over output configurations , is approximated by , @xmath57 where @xmath58 are the special instanton configurations of the output maximizing @xmath59 under the @xmath54 condition , and @xmath60 combines combinatorial and phase - volume factors .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ inst ] for illustration . generally , there are many instantons that are all local maxima of @xmath59 in the noise space .    for the awgn channel ( considered as the main model example ) finding",
    "the instanton means minimizing @xmath61 with respect to the noise vector @xmath13 in the @xmath5-dimensional space and under the condition that the decoding terminates with an error .",
    "instanton estimation for fer at the highest snr , @xmath62 , is @xmath63 , while at moderate values of snr many terms from the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ fer ] ) can contribute to fer comparably .    in our instanton - amoeba numerical scheme instanton with the smallest effective distance , @xmath64 ,",
    "was found by a downhill simplex method also called `` amoeba '' , with accurately tailored ( for better convergence ) annealing .",
    "we repeat the instanton - amoeba evaluation many times , always starting from a new set for initial simplex chosen randomly .",
    "@xmath65 , as a function of noise configuration inside the area of unsuccessful decoding , has multiple minima each corresponding to an instanton .",
    "multiple attempts of the instanton - amoeba evaluations gives us not only the instanton with the minimal @xmath66 but also the whole spectra of higher valued @xmath66 .",
    "instanton is a highly probable configuration of the noise leading to an error . decoding applied to the instanton configuration results in the so - called pseudo - codeword @xcite .",
    "effective distance , @xmath66 , characterizing an instanton and its respective pseudo - codeword , should be compared with the hamming distance of the code , @xmath67 , which measures minimal number of flips ( from @xmath56 to @xmath68 and vice versa ) required for changing from the all zero codeword to another codeword of the code .",
    "instanton / pseudo - codeword with @xmath69 will completely screen contribution of the respective codeword into fer at the largest snrs .",
    "we will see below in section [ sec : results ] ) that this situation is actually realized for one of the codes discussed .",
    "we develop two different versions of  amoeba \" ,  soft \" and  hard \" . in",
    " soft amoeba \" the minimization function decreases with noise probability density in erroneous area of the noise , while in area of successful decoding the function is made artificially big ( to guarantee that the actual minimum is achieved inside the erroneous domain ) . in the `` hard amoeba '' case minimization",
    "is performed only over all orientations of the noise vector , while the length of the vector corresponds exactly to respective point at the error surface , that is the surface separating domains of errors from the domain of correct decoding .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ inst ] for illustration .",
    ") this special point at the error surface is found numerically by bisection method . in @xcite",
    "the  hard amoeba \" was used . in @xcite",
    "we found that even though the  hard amoeba \" outperforms the  soft amoeba \" for relatively short codes , the later one has clear advantage in the computational efficiency for mid - size and long codes .",
    "once an instanton is found numerically , its validity can be verified against a theoretical evaluation .",
    "this theoretical approach , introduced in @xcite , is based on the notion of the computational tree ( ct ) of wiberg @xcite built by unwrapping the tanner graph of a given code into a tree from a bit for which one determines the probability of error .",
    "the concept of ct is useful because the result of iterative decodings at a bit of an ldpc code and at the tree center of the respective ct are equal by construction @xcite .",
    "the initial messages at any bit of the tree are log - likelihoods and , therefore , the result obtained in the tree center is a linear combination of the log - likelihoods with integer coefficients , so the error surface condition becomes @xmath70 with integer @xmath71 that depend on ct structure .",
    "for awgn channel the instanton length is equal to @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "the definition of @xmath71 was generalized in @xcite . in spite of its clear utility",
    "the ct approach becomes impractical for larger number of iterations .",
    "thus , we actually use the ct approach only to verify validity of the instanton - amoeba results for relatively small number of iterations .",
    ".,width=297 ]    suppose a pseudo codeword , @xmath73 , corresponding to the most damaging configuration of the noise ( instanton ) counted from the all zero codeword , @xmath58 , is found .",
    "then finding the instanton configuration itself ( i.e. respective configuration of the noise ) is not a problem , one only needs to maximize the transition probability with respect to the noise field , @xmath13 , taken at @xmath74 under the condition that the self - energy calculated for the pseudo - codeword in the given noise field @xmath13 is zero ( i.e. equal to the value of the self energy for the zero code word ) .",
    "the resulting expression for the optimal configuration of the noise ( instanton ) in the case of the awgn channel is @xmath75 , and the respective effective distance is @xmath76 .",
    "this definition of the effective distance was first described in @xcite , with the first applications of this formula to lp decoding discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "note also that the expressions are reminiscent of the formulas derived by wiberg and co - authors in @xcite and @xcite , in the context of the computational tree analysis applied to iterative decoding with a finite number of iterations .",
    "let us now introduce the pseudo - codeword - search algorithm @xcite inspired by the aforementioned median procedure .    * * start : * initiate a starting configuration of the noise , @xmath77 .",
    "noise is counted from zero codeword and it should be sufficiently large to guarantee convergence of lp to a pseudo - codeword different from the zero codeword . * * step 1 : * lp decodes @xmath78 to a codeword @xmath79 . * * step 2 : * find @xmath80 , the weighted median in the noise space between the pseudo codeword , @xmath81 , and the zero codeword . the awgn expression for the weighted median is @xmath82 . * * step 3 : * if @xmath83 , then @xmath84 and the algorithm terminates .",
    "otherwise go to step 2 , assigning @xmath85 .",
    "( @xmath86 prevents decoding into the zero codeword , keeping the result of decoding within the erroneous domain . ) * * output * configuration @xmath87 is the configuration of the noise that belongs to the error - surface surrounding the zero codeword .",
    "( the error - surface separates the domain of correct lp decisions from the domain of incorrect lp decisions . ) moreover , locally , i.e. for the given part of the error - surface equidistant from the zero codeword and the pseudo codeword @xmath88 , @xmath87 is the nearest point of the error - surface to the zero codeword .",
    "we repeat the algorithm many times picking the initial noise configuration randomly , however guaranteeing that it would be sufficiently far from the zero codeword so that the result of the lp decoding ( first step of the algorithm ) is a pseudo - codeword distinct from the zero codeword .",
    "we showed in @xcite that the pcs algorithm converges in a relatively small number of iterations .",
    "for the sake of completeness , let us also notice that there are some lp - specific limitations which are carried over to the bare pcs algorithm .",
    "thus , lp decoding operates with the local codewords while their number grows exponentially with check degrees , @xmath89 .",
    "however , this undesirable complexity of lp can actually be dealt with .",
    "it was noticed in @xcite that only relatively few of the lp constraints are actually used in decoding .",
    "some suggestions were introduced to overcome the problem @xcite . even though any of the complexity reduction method can probably be used to improve performance of pcs , our only tests so far were based on the dendro - ldpc method of @xcite .",
    "the dendro - ldpc approach suggests to change the graphical representation of the model by replacing all checks of high degree by dendro - subgraphs ( trees ) with appropriate number of auxiliary checks of degree three and number of punctured , i.e. not transmitted , bits of degree two .",
    "we showed in @xcite that the dendro - code and the original code have identical set of codewords and pseudo - codewords .",
    "moreover , for any configuration of the channel output the results of map decodings are identical for the two codes .",
    "another result , reported in @xcite , is that the described above pcs algorithm works flawlessly for the dendro - codes .",
    "the dendro version of the algorithm is actually identical to the one described above under exception of what concerns the punctured nodes .",
    "first , one should always zero the log - likelihoods at all the punctured nodes and , second , calculating the weighted medians one should exclude punctured nodes from the sum .",
    "our direct attempts to extend the pcs algorithm to bp decoding did not succeed . in this",
    "regards , we attribute success of the pcs in the lp case to the fact that the weighted median ( @xmath86 ) of the zero codeword and a pseudo codeword _ is not _",
    "decoded into the zero codeword , generating a new pseudo - codeword with effective distance smaller or equal to ( but never larger than ! ) the one of the initial pseudo - codeword .",
    "this monotonicity feature is apparently lucking in the standard iterative bp . in spite of",
    "that we still found an indirect way of using the pcs lp results for analysis of the bp decoding .",

    "we anticipate that an ensemble approach , e.g. of the type discussed in @xcite , and an individual code instanton approach , of the type discussed in this work , employed together , as complementary parts of one package , could actually be very useful in designing new efficient and application specific coding schemes .",
    "let us conclude by noticing , that instanton analysis of the bp / lp decoding can be easily extended to variety of interesting correlated channels , e.g. inter - symbol - interference channel .",
    "the approach can also be tuned to other problems in communications , storage , operational research and network science , wherever it is necessary to analyze algorithms of statistical inference in an extreme , low probability domain unaccessible to standard monte - carlo methods .",
