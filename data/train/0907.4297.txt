    "absorbing states , i.e. , states which systems may fall into but never escape from , and phase transitions into them are expected to be ubiquitous in nature . for instance , spreading or contamination processes like fires or epidemics exhibit such transitions when the propagation rate changes : initially active ( infected ) regions eventually disappear forever at low rates , i.e. , the absorbing state is reached , while they can be sustained ( pandemic regime ) for fast - enough propagation .",
    "examples abound far beyond : hundreds of numerical models , describing , e.g. , catalytic reactions , granular flows , and calcium dynamics in living cells , to name but a few , have been shown to exhibit such absorbing phase transitions @xcite .",
    "such phase transitions also naturally arise from general problems such as synchronization @xcite , self - organized criticality @xcite , spatiotemporal intermittency @xcite , and depinning @xcite .",
    "the vast majority of these transitions share the same critical behavior , that of the `` directed percolation '' ( dp ) class @xcite , as long as they are continuous .    deep theoretical issues",
    "underpin this situation . whereas universality is well understood for systems in thermodynamic equilibrium ,",
    "this is still not the case for systems driven out of equilibrium , where even the relevant ingredients determining the class are not well understood . in this context ,",
    "absorbing phase transitions are central because of their genuine nonequilibrium character , since absorbing states directly imply violation of the detailed balance .",
    "janssen and grassberger @xcite conjectured that the dp universality class contains all continuous transitions into a single effective absorbing state in the absence of any extra symmetry or conservation law .",
    "the dp class thus appears as the simplest , and most common case , as testified by overwhelming numerical evidence .",
    "however , the situation has been quite different in experiments . over the last twenty years and more",
    ", a number of experiments have been performed in situations where dp - class transitions would be theoretically expected , but they have always yielded mixed and/or partial results with limited accuracy @xcite ( table [ tbl : earlierexperiments ] ) . this lack of fully convincing experimental realizations , in contrast with the wealth of numerical results , has been found surprising and a matter of concern in the literature @xcite .",
    "recently , though , studying a spatiotemporal intermittency regime occurring in turbulent liquid crystals , we found a transition whose complete set of static critical exponents match those of the dp class @xcite .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to provide a comprehensive report on this transition including not only a more complete description of experiments designed to investigate the static critical behavior , but also new experiments giving access to dynamic critical behavior .    ",

    "note that the meaningful figure is that of the total system size , which is at least four orders of magnitude larger than in earlier experimental studies ( table [ tbl : earlierexperiments ] ) . in the following , we vary @xmath63 and fix the frequency at @xmath76 , at roughly one third of the cutoff frequency @xmath77 which separates the conducting and the dielectric regimes of electroconvection @xcite .    disclinations being topological defects , the spontaneous nucleation of dsm2 in a dsm1 domain is in principle forbidden .",
    "it is indeed an essentially unobservable rare event , except along the edges of the electrode and for very high voltages , far from the range investigated in the present paper .",
    "therefore , the fully dsm1 state serves as an absorbing state . on the other hand , dsm2 domains introduced externally , or present initially in the system can remain sustained in the bulk for large enough voltages , but eventually disappear for voltages lower than a certain threshold @xmath78 . closely above @xmath78 , a regime of spatiotemporal intermittency ( sti )",

    "this implies that the contamination process of dsm2 is indeed driven by the anisotropic , fluctuating shear flow of surrounding dsm1 .",

    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we now return to our initial remark concerning the surprising scarcity of experimental realizations of dp - class transitions ( table [ tbl : earlierexperiments ] ) .",
    "one central difficulty lies in the necessity to avoid , as much as possible , quenched disorder , which is known to be relevant .",
    "it is theoretically known that such disorder does affect dp criticality and even destroys it for strong disorder @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical and numerical studies show that even weak disorder changes the asymptotic critical behavior @xcite , but the characteristic length / time scale separating dp and disordered , so - called `` activated '' critical behavior grows fast with decreasing strength of disorder @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to work with systems made of macroscopic units , where quenched disorder is expected to be negligible .",
    "we consider that the quenched disorder in our system , which may take the form of inhomogeneities in the electrodes or impurities in the sample , is also sufficiently weak .    still , our dsm1-dsm2 transition seems to be the only fully convincing one .",
    "three factors explain , in our view , why our experiments provided such clear dp scaling laws .",
    "\\(a ) _ large system size and fast response_. as already mentioned , one great advantage to work with electroconvection is that very large aspect ratios can easily be realized .",
    "the number of effective degrees of freedom of our cell is @xmath52 , which is orders of magnitude larger than any earlier experiment ( table [ tbl : earlierexperiments ] ) .",
    "this considerably suppresses finite - size effects and allows to observe scaling on several orders of magnitude .",
    "similarly , the typical microscopic timescales of liquid crystals are very short ( of the order of @xmath216 ) , providing accurate statistics in reasonable laboratory time .",
    "\\(b ) _ almost perfectly absorbing state_. the condition for being an absorbing state , i.e. , that the system can _ never _ escape once it entered , appears to be somewhat too strict from the experimental point of view . indeed",
    ", spontaneous nucleation of the active state seems to have been present at least in some of the past experiments @xcite , which blurs the critical behavior beyond some finite scales .    on the other hand , our active state , dsm2 ,",
    "consists of topological defects , whose spontaneous formation is in principle forbidden . of course this may occur in practice , as suggested from the observation of vanishing hysteresis at the dsm1-dsm2 transition @xcite , but",
    "the nucleation rate remains so low that we can not directly observe it , constituting an almost perfectly absorbing state .",
    "( c ) _ fluctuating absorbing state_. in most earlier experiments and numerical studies , the absorbing state has been essentially fluctuation - free , or laminar .",
    "this is indeed a natural choice suggested from the minimal theory of dp , and causes of course no problem in numerical studies . in experiments , however , such absorbing states may typically cause long - range effects through the rigidity of their laminar pattern and/or the propagation of soliton - like objects , which may further reduce the effective system size and even break dp scaling @xcite .",
    "in contrast , our absorbing state , dsm1 , is itself a fluctuating , turbulent state .",
    "long - range interactions are then likely to be killed by the local turbulent fluctuations of dsm1 , which may have led to the observation of clean dp critical behavior .",
    "it is noteworthy to remark that the chat - manneville coupled map lattice @xcite , a deterministic numerical model for absorbing phase transitions with a non - chaotic ( laminar ) absorbing state , exhibits non - dp critical behavior probably due to soliton - like objects propagating through laminar regions .",
    "interestingly , an elementary modification to render its absorbing state itself chaotic does lead to dp scaling @xcite .    in conclusion",
    ", we have experimentally found that the dsm1-dsm2 transition in the electroconvection of nematic liquid crystals , showing an absorbing transition into spatiotemporal intermittency , clearly belongs to the dp universality class .",
    "both static and dynamic critical behavior has been investigated with the help of the newly developed experimental technique to create a seed of dsm2 , confirming a total of 12 critical exponents , 5 scaling functions , 8 scaling relations , and in particular the rapidity symmetry , in full agreement with those characterizing the dp class in @xmath217 dimensions . we hope that this first clear and comprehensive experimental realization of a dp - class transition will trigger further studies of absorbing phase transitions and of related situations with genuinely non - equilibrium critical properties . in this respect the recent works of cort _ et al .",

    "every analysis presented in the paper is performed using binarized images , where dsm2 domains are distinguished from the absorbing dsm1 background .",
    "we give here a detailed description of the binarizing algorithm we used .",
    "the binarization is carried out in the following manner : ( a ) we prepare three successive images taken at 15 frames per second , and remove the inhomogeneity of the incident light intensity .",
    "( b ) we then normalize the obtained intensity @xmath218 of the three images with respect to mean @xmath219 and standard deviation @xmath220 of the dsm1 intensity at a given voltage , namely @xmath221 . note that we can separately measure the intensity of the fully dsm1 state even above the threshold @xmath78 , since dsm1 always appears first when the voltage is applied .",
    "( c ) since dsm2 domains have lower transmittance than dsm1 , we extract the regions where the normalized intensity is less than a certain threshold @xmath222 . here",
    "we chose @xmath223 , determined so as to obtain a good agreement with direct visual observations , particularly in movies .",
    "( d ) taking into consideration that dsm2 domains move much slower than the local intensity fluctuations in dsm1 ( recall that dsm1 is itself a turbulent state ) and that the minimum dsm2 area is @xmath80 @xcite , where @xmath123 is the depth of the cell , we take the logical intersection ( `` and '' operator ) of the three successive images , and then remove clusters with area smaller than @xmath80 .",
    "clusters are screened out in this way , and their binarized images in the middle frame are used as final images . in other words ,",
    "the intersection is used only for comparison with the minimum area .",
    "( e ) finally , we cut off the periphery of the image of width @xmath224 , since this region is biased in the step ( d ) .",
    "the size of the binarized images reduces to @xmath225 , which roughly corresponds to @xmath226 effective degrees of freedom .",
    "we confirmed that the chosen threshold ( @xmath223 ) works well all over the range of voltages we investigate , and that no dsm2 region is falsely detected when binarizing images of the fully dsm1 phase .",
    "typical results of the binarization are shown in fig .",

    "[ sec : criticalspreading ] , we have slightly modified the binarization algorithm in order to detect dsm2 patches originating only from the prepared seed , and not to miss them . to this end , we have reduced the intensity threshold @xmath227 to @xmath228 , and instead , binarized only within a target region , defined from positions of dsm2 patches in previous images ( position of the seed for the first image ) and assumed maximal displacement of dsm2 , which is chosen to be much larger than the actual displacement , namely , @xmath123 during successive two images taken at @xmath229 fps and extrapolated diffusively .",
