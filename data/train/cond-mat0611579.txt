    "ruthenocuprate system rusr@xmath0__re__@xmath5ce@xmath6cu@xmath0o@xmath1 ( ru1222 ) ( _ re _ = rare - earth element , @xmath7 ",
    "@xmath8 ) has been shown to exhibit peculiar magnetic behavior , the origin of which is still elusive . from the first reports  @xcite it has attracted much attention due to the possible coexistence of the ferromagnetic and superconducting order parameters .",
    "it is assumed that the magnetism originates from the ruo@xmath2 planes , while the superconductivity is confined to the cuo@xmath2 planes as in other high - t@xmath9 materials .",
    "later , the sister compound rusr@xmath0__re__cu@xmath0o@xmath10 ( ru1212 ) has also revealed this possibility  @xcite and at the present there is a good amount of results from various techniques , including neutron diffraction  @xcite , muon spin rotation  @xcite , dc and ac susceptibility  @xcite and mssbauer spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "however , this has not produced any definitive conclusion about the state of the magnetic order in ruthenocuprates .",
    "the main difficulty lies in the fact that the results from the magnetization  @xcite , mssbauer  @xcite , esr  @xcite and @xmath11sr  @xcite suggest the existence of the ferromagnetic component with saturation moment around @xmath12 while the neutron diffraction has shown antiferromagnetic long - range order  @xcite with a possible ferromagnetic component @xmath13 .",
    "xue and coworkers have suggested the phase - separation scenario for both compositions  @xcite with the ferromagnetic islands inside the antiferromagnetic matrix which would somewhat reconcile two opposing hypotheses .",
    "evidence that at high temperatures only about 15% of the volume is ordered in ru1222 system  @xcite supports this scenario but the microscopic picture is still lacking .",
    "recently , a new compound in the ruthenocuprate family with the formula rusr@xmath0rece@xmath0cu@xmath0o@xmath14 ( ru1232 ) has been synthesized  @xcite .",
    "it shows similar magnetic behavior as well as superconductivity .",
    "no detailed investigation has been published so far on this compound .    in this report",
    "we focus our attention on the ru1222 system , particularly on the parent composition rusr@xmath0__re__@xmath5ce@xmath6cu@xmath0o@xmath1 with @xmath15 .",
    "it is not superconducting because stoichiometricaly the copper ions are in the 2 + state ( no doped holes ) and ru ions are in the 5 + state . on the other hand it should be less permeable to the oxygen inhomogeneities which are unavoidable for the @xmath16  @xcite . in previous report",
    "@xcite the existence of a magnetic transition around @xmath17 k has been shown , below which the zero field cooled ( zfc ) and field cooled ( fc ) magnetization curves start to branch , indicating a development of an ordered phase .",
    "below this temperature @xmath11sr  @xcite and mssbauer spectroscopy  @xcite revealed that only 15% of the sample volume is ordered .",
    "the main magnetic transition occurs at @xmath18 k  @xcite where ac and dc susceptibilities start to rise sharply indicating some kind of a ferromagnetic transition , although frequency dependence of the peak has been observed and the spin - glass order suggested  @xcite .",
    "below @xmath19 the time relaxation of ac susceptibility and the inverted butterfly hysteresis has been observed  @xcite . from @xmath11sr",
    "@xcite and mssbauer spectroscopy  @xcite a 100% of the sample volume is in the ordered state .",
    "for the compositions with @xmath20 there is a superconducting transition around 30 k.    alongside this main features , an anomaly around 130 k has been observed but it has been argued that it is not a bulk transition  @xcite . also , between the main peak at @xmath19 and the superconducting transition cardoso and coworkers noticed thermal hysteresis with the peak in the imaginary part of the ac susceptibility for the @xmath21 composition which shifts with the frequency  @xcite .",
    "they ascribed it to the rearrangement of the spins within the spin - glass state .",
    "we have performed detailed investigation of the real and imaginary part of the ac susceptibility in the ru1222 system at low temperatures . here",
    "we present , to the best of our knowledge , for the first time the low temperature transition in ru1222 system .",
    "we have investigated two different batches of the ruthenocuprate rusr@xmath0__re__@xmath5ce@xmath6cu@xmath0o@xmath1 with @xmath15 composition which were prepared at different times following the solid - state reaction procedure .",
    "x - ray diffraction measurements indicated that the impuritiy levels are very small ( @xmath22 )  @xcite .",
    "we have denoted the samples with s1 and s2 .",
    "the signal from the samples did nt change through several years , indicating good stability of the composition .",
    "ac susceptibility measurements were taken by the use of a commercial cryobind system .",
    "all the measurements were conducted in the heating regime with a heating rate below 2 k / min .",
    "magnetization measurements were performed using a commercial quantum design mpms5 squid magnetometer .",
    "samples were cooled down from 250 k to 2 k in zero field , then the measuring field would be applied and the zfc magnetization curve measured up to 250 k. after cooling the sample in the presence of the field , the fc curve was measured while increasing the temperature .",
    "in fig .  [ temp_dependence ]",
    "we present temperature dependence of the real and imaginary part of the ac susceptibility for two samples of the ru1222 system with the @xmath15 composition .",
    "both samples show similar behavior , including the main peak at @xmath18 k , a shoulder around 60 - 70 k  @xcite ( visible in the imaginary part ) and a drop in the real part below 30 k accompanied with a kink in the imaginary part around 10 k ( @xmath23 ) . for the s1 sample",
    "there is a visible signature of the anomaly around 130 k that is not present for the s2 sample .",
    "taking into account that below 130 k both curves appear almost identical , we can conclude that the anomaly does not influence basic magnetic ordering in the ru1222 system .",
    "this conclusion is in agreement with observations from @xmath11sr that the anomaly does not show a bulk character  @xcite .",
    "worth mentioning , s2 sample shows somewhat larger signal in both real and imaginary part of the ac susceptibility below @xmath19 but eventually at the lowest temperatures the signals become equal in magnitude , suggesting a similar ground state .",
    "dc magnetic measurements of the s1 sample are shown in fig .",
    "[ squid ] . for small fields around @xmath19",
    "there is a strong increase in the signal below which a cusp in the zfc curve develops and the branching between fc and zfc curves starts to grow .",
    "this has been attributed to the emergence of the weak ferromagnetic state  @xcite .",
    "the fc  zfc divergence is present at temperatures as high as 200 k , around the temperature where @xmath11sr and mssbauer spectroscopy revealed the ordering of the minority fraction  @xcite . around 50 k",
    "there is a kink in the zfc curves also observed by cardoso and coworkers  @xcite .",
    "zfc curve measured in 10 oe does not show a drop indicating that the sample was cooled not in zero but in a field with finite value .",
    "we ascribe this effect to the remanent field in the superconducting magnet . as the field increases , the cusp in the zfc curve broadens and moves to lower temperatures . for @xmath24",
    "oe there is no difference between the fc and zfc curves .",
    "now we proceed to the main result of this report : the low temperature transition in the ru1222euce system .",
    "we have investigated the frequency dependence of the ac susceptibility of the ru1222euce system and in the figs .",
    "[ low_s1 ] and  [ low_s2 ] we show the relevant temperature region around 10 k of the imaginary part for the s1 and s2 samples , respectively .        as the frequency of the driving field is increased , there is an overall shift of the signal to higher values , indicating greater energy dissipation in the sample . for both samples there",
    "is a kink in the curves which shifts to higher temperatures as the frequency is increased . due to the roundness of the kink ,",
    "a straightforward determination of the characteristic temperature is not possible .",
    "therefore , for each frequency , we have fitted linear parts of the curve below and above the kink and then used the crossing of the two lines to define @xmath23 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ low_s1 ] .",
    "there is a small difference in obtained @xmath23 for two samples . in the investigated frequency range ,",
    "s1 exhibits a kink between 4 k and 6 k , while the kink for s2 spans from 6 k to 8 k. in the same temperature window the real part of the ac susceptibility shows a minor change in the slope of the curve and varies only slightly with frequency ( not shown ) .        after extracting the characteristic temperature for each frequency ,",
    "we can search for an appropriate description of the frequency dependence @xmath25",
    ". a quantitative measure of the frequency shift can be obtained from the ratio @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "cardoso and coworkers used this ratio as a signature of the presence of the spin - glass order below the main magnetic transition at @xmath19 . in our case , this ratio is in the range of 0.1 which is somewhat lower than the characteristic superparamagnetic value but substantially larger than the spin - glass values which go as low as 0.005 ( _ _ cu__mn ) but can be as high as 0.06 ( eu@xmath27sr@xmath28s )  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ arrhenius ] we show the frequency dependence of the characteristic temperature @xmath23 through the arrhenius law    @xmath29    known to describe well the superparamagnetic systems  @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath30 is the frequency of the magnetic field , @xmath31 is the attempt frequency and @xmath32 is the potential barrier between the two easy orientations of the superparamagnetic particle .     for the s1 and s2 samples .",
    "the dashed lines are best fits using the arrhenius law ( see text ) . ]",
    "extracted parameters of the arrhenius law are @xmath33 hz , @xmath34 k and @xmath35 hz , @xmath36 k for the s1 and s2 samples , respectively .",
    "the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ arrhenius ] represent the best fits using the above values .",
    "the main question to be answered here is to what kind of a transition does the above described event belongs to .",
    "as shown above it displays a pattern familiar for blocking of the superparamagnetic particles . here",
    ", spins on the magnetic ions are connected through some kind of an internal interaction into a cluster whose total spin fluctuates at high temperatures but is blocked in the easy axis direction at lower temperatures .",
    "intrinsic to this scenario is a phase separation between the superparamagnetic particles and the matrix in which these particles are dispersed . in ruthenocuprates",
    "a phase separation has been proposed to account for a variety of conflicting measurements  @xcite .",
    "specifically , @xmath11sr  @xcite and mssbauer spectroscopy  @xcite showed that only 15% of the sample gets ordered around 180 k , while the rest of the volume orders at the main magnetic transition temperature @xmath19 . in that context , the presence of another species of superparamagnetic particles in the system should not be neglected .",
    "relatively small change in the real part of the ac susceptibility below the blocking temperature suggests only a minor volume fraction and explains why it went unnoticed so far .",
    "there is also a question about the origin of the superparamagnetic particles , i.e. are they intrinsic to the material or impurity related .",
    "recently , felner and coworkers investigated the origins of the high temperature phase separation and suggested either high concentration regions of ru@xmath37 ions or minor srru@xmath38cu@xmath39o@xmath40 magnetic phase to be responsible for the formation of the ordered fraction  @xcite .",
    "additionally , they showed that the parent composition with @xmath15 is intrinsically different with respect to the samples with less ce .",
    "for @xmath16 there is a depletion of oxygen which compensates the charge disbalance caused by an increase in the _",
    "re_/ce ratio .",
    "the lack of oxygen ions can be inhomogeneously distributed throughout the material , inducing the phase separation .",
    "interestingly , the investigation of the @xmath41 composition ( the only non - superconducting composition besides the @xmath15 ; not shown ) , prepared at the same time as the s1 sample , shows no evidence for a superparamagnetic blocking similar to the one described in this report for the @xmath15 composition .",
    "also , the fact that we have observed the same feature in two different samples of the same @xmath15 composition prepared at different time suggests that this is not related to a specific batch .",
    "this leads us to conclude that the origin of the superparamagnetic particles could be intrinsically connected to the parent composition with @xmath15 .",
    "in the variety of magnetic features known to exist in the ruthenocuprate family we have observed another one . below 10 k",
    "there is a kink in the imaginary part of the ac susceptibility for the ru1222euce samples which shows frequency dependence characteristic of the blocking of the superparamagnetic particles .",
    "the real part of the ac susceptibility and dc measurements show minor change in the same temperature window .",
    "only the parent compound with @xmath15 composition reveals this transition while in the @xmath41 composition it is absent .",
    "this could be a good indication of the intrinsic behavior in the material beacuse it has been shown that compositions with @xmath16 are affected by the change in the oxygen content and the ru valence differs from the 5 + value  @xcite .",
    "since only two samples have been investigated , an impurity related conclusion should not be discarded as yet .",
