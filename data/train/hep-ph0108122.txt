    "the actual measurement performed by the e821 collaboration is of the muon s _ anomalous _ magnetic moment , which is to say , the coefficient @xmath0 of the non - renormalizable operator @xmath8 within the standard model , @xmath0 is predicted to be  @xcite @xmath9 it has been claimed that the quoted uncertainty is actually too small  @xcite ; the dominant uncertainty is the hadronic contribution to the photon polarization diagrams which is extracted from experimental measurements of @xmath10 in the vicinity of the low - energy meson resonances .",
    "however , strong arguments have been made to reinforce the quoted values  @xcite , and we will accept them here as given .",
    "the measurement made by e821 is  @xcite : @xmath11 from which one deduces a discrepancy between the experiment and the standard model of @xmath12 that is , the measured value is _ larger _ than the prediction by @xmath13 .",
    "the susy contributions to @xmath0 have been known since the early days of susy and have become more complete with time@xcite . in this paper",
    "we will follow the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite which has the advantage of using the standard conventions of haber and kane  @xcite ; any convention which we do not define here can be found in either of these two papers .",
    "before we begin the discussion of our work , let us review briefly a few of the analyses to date .",
    "the first paper to use the new e821 data in the context of susy was that of czarnecki and marciano  @xcite who only attempted to approximately bound the sparticle spectrum .",
    "more complete analyses followed quickly thereafter by everett  @xcite and feng and matchev  @xcite .",
    "the former  @xcite argued that only very large values of @xmath2 were generically consistent with the data ; given those , a @xmath14 upper bound of @xmath15 could be placed on some sparticle ( gaugino or slepton ) for @xmath16 , and @xmath17 for both a chargino and the muon sneutrino .",
    "the latter analysis  @xcite found a model - independent @xmath1 limit on the mass of the lightest `` observable '' sparticle of @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "martin and wells did a more complete analysis , but focussed on the lighter chargino and charged smuon .",
    "their model - independent analysis found no upper bound on the chargino mass at @xmath1 but found @xmath20 . with the added assumption of gaugino mass unification ( , @xmath21 ) ,",
    "the lighter chargino was bounded by about @xmath22 at @xmath23 .",
    "the lack of a strong upper bound on the chargino was due to the neutralino contributions at small @xmath2 ( all the way down to @xmath24 ) which can explain the e821 data without any chargino piece at all .",
    "finally , there have been a number of other papers  @xcite which have studied the susy contributions within specialized scenarios which we will not discuss here .      in the mass eigenbasis",
    ", there are only two one - loop susy diagrams which contribute to @xmath0 , shown in figure  1 .",
    "the first has an internal loop of smuons and neutralinos , the second a loop of sneutrinos and charginos .",
    "but the charginos , neutralinos and even the smuons are themselves admixtures of various interaction eigenstates and we can better understand the physics involved by working in terms of these interaction diagrams , of which there are many more than two .",
    "we can easily separate the leading and subleading diagrams in the interaction eigenbasis by a few simple observations .",
    "= 4.25 in    first , the magnetic moment operator is a helicity - flipping interaction .",
    "thus any diagram which contributes to @xmath0 must involve a helicity flip somewhere along the fermion current .",
    "this automatically divides the diagrams into two classes : those with helicity flips on the external legs and those with flips on an internal line . for those in the first class , the amplitude must scale as @xmath25 ; for those in the second , the amplitudes can scale instead by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 represents the mass of the internal susy fermion ( a chargino or neutralino ) . since @xmath28 , it is the latter class that will typically dominate the susy contribution to @xmath0 .",
    "therefore we will restrict further discussion to this latter class of diagrams alone .",
    "secondly , the interaction of the neutralinos and charginos with the ( s)muons and sneutrinos occurs either through their higgsino or gaugino components .",
    "thus each vertex implies a factor of either @xmath29 ( the muon yukawa coupling ) or @xmath30 ( the weak and/or hypercharge gauge coupling ) .",
    "given two vertices , the diagrams therefore scale as @xmath31 , @xmath32 or @xmath33 .",
    "in the standard model , @xmath29 is smaller than @xmath30 by roughly @xmath34 . in the minmal susy standard model ( mssm ) at low @xmath2 , this ratio is essentially unchanged , but because @xmath29 scales as @xmath35 , at large @xmath2 ( @xmath36 ) the ratio can be reduced to roughly @xmath37 .",
    "thus we can safely drop the @xmath31 contributions from our discussions , but at large @xmath2 we must preserve the @xmath32 pieces as well as the @xmath33 pieces .",
    "the pieces that we will keep are therefore shown in figures  2 . in fig .",
    "2(a)-(e ) are shown the five neutralino contributions which scale as @xmath33 or @xmath32 ; in fig .",
    "2(f ) is the only chargino contribution , scaling as @xmath32 .",
    "the contributions to @xmath0 from the @xmath38th neutralino and the @xmath39th smuon due to each of these component diagrams are found to be : @xmath40 and for the @xmath41th chargino and the sneutrino : @xmath42 the matrices @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are defined in the appendix along with the functions @xmath46 . a careful comparison to the equations in the appendix will reveal that we have dropped a number of complex conjugations in the above expressions ; it has been shown previously  @xcite that the susy contributions to @xmath0 are maximized for real entries in the mass matrices and so we will not retain phases in our discussion .",
    "= 4.25 in    in many of the previous analyses of the mssm parameter space , it was found that it is the chargino - sneutrino diagram at large @xmath2 that can most easily generate values of @xmath47 large enough to explain the observed discrepancy . from this observation",
    ", one can obtain an upper mass bound on the lightest chargino and the muon sneutrino . however , this behavior is not completely generic .",
    "for example , martin and wells have emphasized that the @xmath48 neutralino contribution can _ by itself _",
    "be large enough to generate the observed excess in @xmath0 , and since it has no intrinsic @xmath2 dependence , they could explain the data with @xmath2 as low as 3",
    ". we can reproduce their result in a simple way because the @xmath48 contribution has a calculable upper bound at which the smuons mix at @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 with @xmath52 . then @xmath53 where we have used the fact that @xmath54 and @xmath55 and have included a 7% two - loop suppression factor .",
    "though any real model will clearly suppress this contribution somewhat , this is still @xmath56 times larger than needed experimentally .",
    "this pure @xmath48 scenario is actually an experimental worst - case , particularly for hadron colliders .",
    "the only sparticles that are required to be light are a single neutralino ( which is probably @xmath57-like ) and a single @xmath58 .",
    "the neutralino is difficult to produce , and if stable , impossible to detect directly .",
    "the neutralino could be indirectly observed in the decay of the @xmath58 as missing energy , but production of a @xmath58 at a hardon machine is highly suppressed . in the worst of all possible worlds , e821 could be explained by only these two light sparticles , with the rest of the susy spectrum hiding above a tev .",
    "further , even the `` light '' sparticles can be too heavy to produce at a @xmath59 linear collider .",
    "while this case is in no way generic , it demonstrates that the e821 data by itself does not provide any sort of no - lose theorem for run  ii of the tevatron or even for the lhc and nlc .",
    "this raises an important experimental question : how many of the mssm states must be `` light '' in order to explain the e821 data ? in the worst - case , it would appear to be only two . even in the more optimistic scenario in which the chargino diagram dominates @xmath47 , the answer naively appears to be two : a single chargino and a single sneutrino . in this limit ,",
    "@xmath60 where we have bounded @xmath61 by 10 by assuming @xmath62 .",
    "but this discussion is overly simplistic and we can do much better , as we will see .",
    "there are a total of 9 separate sparticles which can enter the loops in fig .",
    "[ simple ] : 1 sneutrino , 2 smuons , 2 charginos and 4 neutralinos .",
    "the mass spectrum of these 9 sparticles is determined entirely by 7 parameters in the mssm : 2 soft slepton masses(@xmath63 , @xmath64 ) , 2 gaugino masses ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) , the @xmath67-term , a soft trilinear slepton coupling ( @xmath68 ) and finally @xmath2 .",
    "of these , @xmath68 plays almost no role at all and so we leave it out of our discussions ( see the appendix ) . and in some well - motivated susy - breaking scenarios , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are also correlated .",
    "thus there are either 5 or 6 parameters responsible for setting 9 sparticle masses .",
    "there are clearly non - trivial correlations among the masses which can be exploited in setting mass limits on the sparticles .",
    "first , there are well - known correlations between the chargino and neutralino masses ; for example , a light charged @xmath69 implies a light neutral @xmath70 and vice - versa .",
    "there are also correlations in mixed systems ( , the neutralinos , charginos and smuons ) between the masses of the eigenstates and the size of their mixings .",
    "consider the case of the smuons in particular ; their mass matrix is given in the appendix .",
    "on diagonalizing , the left - right smuon mixing angle is given simply by : @xmath71 the chargino contribution is maximized for large smuon mixing and large mixing occurs when the numerator is of order or greater than the denominator ; since the former is suppressed by @xmath25 , one must compensate by having either a very large @xmath67-term in the numerator or nearly equal @xmath72 and @xmath73 in the denominator , both of which have profound impacts on the spectrum .",
    "there is one more correlation / constraint that we feel is natural to impose on the mssm spectrum : slepton mass universality .",
    "it is well - known that the most general version of the mssm produces huge flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) unless some external order is placed on the mssm spectrum . by far , the simplest such order is the demand that sparticles with the same gauge quantum numbers be degenerate .",
    "thus we expect @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "then the mass matrix for the stau sector is identical to that of the smuons with the replacement @xmath76 in the off - diagonal elements .",
    "this enhancement of the mixing in the stau sector by @xmath77 implies that @xmath78 . in particular , if @xmath79 then @xmath80 and qed will be broken by a stau vev .",
    "given slepton universality , this imposes a constraint on the smuon mass matrix : @xmath81 or on the smuon mixing angle : @xmath82 where @xmath83 are the positive roots of @xmath84 . while not eliminating the possibility of @xmath85",
    ", this formula shows that a fine - tuning of at least 1 part in 17 is needed to obtain @xmath86 mixing .",
    "we will not apply any kind of fine - tuning criterion to our analysis , yet we will find that this slepton mass universality constraint sharply reduces the upper bounds on slepton masses which we are able to find in our study of points in mssm parameter space .",
    "( as an aside , if one assumes slepton mass universality at some susy - breaking messenger scale above the weak scale , yukawa - induced corrections will break universality by driving the stau masses down . this effect",
    "would further tighten our bounds on smuon masses and mixings . )",
    "the above discussion has an especially large impact on the worst - case scenario in which the @xmath48 contibutions dominates @xmath47 . for generic points in mssm parameter space",
    ", one expects that @xmath87 which reduces the size of the @xmath48 contribution by a factor of 17 . as a byproduct",
    ", the masses required for explaining the e821 anomaly are pushed back towards the range that can be studied by a @xmath59 linear collider .",
    "now that we have established the basic principle of our analysis , let us carry it out in detail .",
    "we will concentrate on three basic cases .",
    "the first case is the one most often considered in the literature : gaugino mass unification .",
    "here one assumes that the weak - scale gaugino mass parameters ( @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) are equal at the same scale at which the gauge couplings unify .",
    "this implies that at the weak scale @xmath88 .",
    "the second case we consider is identical to the first with the added requirement that the lightest susy sparticle ( lsp ) be a neutralino .",
    "this requirement is motivated by the desire to explain astrophysical dark matter by a stable lsp .",
    "finally we will also consider the most general case in which all relevant susy parameters are left free independent of each other ; we will refer to this as the `` general mssm '' case .",
    "the basic methodology is simple : we put down a logarithmic grid on the space of mssm parameters ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath67 ) for several choices of @xmath2 .",
    "the grid extends from @xmath89 for @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , and from @xmath90 for @xmath91 , up to @xmath92 for all mass parameters . for the case in which gaugino unification is imposed",
    "@xmath66 is no longer a free parameter and our grid contains @xmath93 points . for the general mssm case our grid contains @xmath94 points .",
    "only @xmath95 is considered since that maximizes the value of @xmath47 .",
    "finally , for our limits on @xmath2 we used an adaptive mesh routine which did a better job of maximizing @xmath47 over the space of mssm inputs . by",
    "running with grids of varying resolutions and offsets we estimate the error on our mass bounds to be less than @xmath96 .",
    "perhaps the most important information that can be garnered from the e821 data is an upper bound on the scale of sparticle masses . in particular",
    ", one can place upper bounds on the masses of the lightest sparticle(s ) as a function of @xmath47 .",
    "previous analyses have often followed this approach , deriving upper bounds on the lightest sparticle from among the gauginos and sleptons , or even more specifically , from among the charginos and smuons .",
    "we too derive bounds on the lightest sparticles , but as we have argued in the previous section , we can also derive bounds on the second , third , and even fourth lightest sparticles through the mass correlations .",
    "these bounds on additional light sparticles provide an important lesson . without them there remains the very real possibility that the e821 data is explained by a pair of light sparticles and that the remaining susy spectrum is out of reach experimentally .",
    "but our additional bounds will give us some indication not only of where we can find susy , but also of how much information we might be able to extract about the fundamental parameters of susy  the more sparticles we detect and measure , the more information we will have for disentangling the soft - breaking sector of the mssm .    in fig .",
    "[ massfig ] we have shown the upper mass bounds for the lightest four sparticles assuming gaugino mass unification .",
    "these bounds are not bounds on individual species of sparticles ( which will come in the next section and always be larger than these bounds ) but simply bounds on whatever sparticle happens to be lightest . the important points to note are : _ ( i ) _ the maximum values of the mass correspond to the largest value of @xmath2 , which is to be expected given dominance of the chargino diagram at large @xmath2 ; _ ( ii ) _ the @xmath1 limit ( central value ) of the e821 data requires _ at least _ 4 sparticles to lie below roughly @xmath97 ; and _ ( iii ) _ for low values of @xmath2 a maximum value of @xmath47 is reached ( we will return to this later ) .        the same plots could be produced with the additional assumption that the lsp be a neutralino , but we will only show the case for the lsp bound , in fig .",
    "[ lspfig ] . in this figure",
    ", the solid lines correspond to a neutralino lsp , while the dotted lines are for the more general case discussed above ( , they match the lines in fig .",
    "[ massfig](a ) ) .",
    "notice that for @xmath98 there is little difference between the cases with and without a neutralino lsp .",
    "furthermore , at the extreme upper and lower values of @xmath2 there is little difference .",
    "it is only for the intermediate values of @xmath2 that the mass bound shifts appreciably ; for @xmath99 it comes down by as much as @xmath90 compared to the more general case .",
    "= 4.25 in    finally , we consider the most general mssm case , , without gaugino unification . here",
    "the correlations are much less pronounced , but interesting bounds still exist .",
    "for example the central value of the e821 data still demands at least 3 sparticles below @xmath59 ( rather than four for the previous cases ) . in figure  [ nongutmaxes ]",
    "we demonstrate this explicitly by plotting the masses of the four lightest sparticles for @xmath100 and a wide range of @xmath47 .",
    "we see that dropping the gaugino unification requirement has one primary effect : the mass of the lsp is significantly increased .",
    "this is because the lsp in the unified case is usually a @xmath101 but is nt itself responsible for generating @xmath47 . in the general case ,",
    "the lsp must participate in @xmath47 ( otherwise its mass could be arbitrarily large ) and so is roughly the mass of the _ second _ lightest sparticle in the unified case , whether that be a @xmath58 or @xmath102 .",
    "otherwise the differences between the more general mssm and the gaugino unified mssm are small .",
    "in particular we still find that at least 4 sparticles must be light , though the @xmath1 bound of @xmath22 for the unified case extends now slightly to @xmath3 .",
    "= 4.25 in    we have summarized all this data on the lsp in table  [ masstable ] where we have shown the mass bounds ( using both the @xmath1 limit and the central value of the e821 data ) on the lsp for various @xmath2 values and with our various assumptions .",
    "the last line in the table represents an upper bound for any model with @xmath103 : @xmath104 for the e821 @xmath1 lower bound ( central value ) of @xmath47 .",
    "but perhaps of equal importance are the bounds on the next 3 lightest sparticles ( the `` 2lsp , '' `` 3lsp '' and `` 4lsp '' ) : @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "thus there must be at least 4 sparticles below @xmath3 even in the most general mssm scenario , and at least two sparticles accessible to a @xmath108 linear collider .",

    "these bounds will of mathematical necessity be higher than those derived in the previous section , but still provide important information about how and where to look for susy . in particular , they can help us gauge the likelihood of finding susy at run  ii of the tevatron or at the lhc .",

    "first , the plot assumes gaugino unification ; dropping that assumption can lead to significantly heavier masses for the @xmath116 though not for the @xmath115 ; this is because the light @xmath115 is needed to participate in the magnetic moment , while @xmath116 can decouple .",
    "second , we have also assumed a neutralino lsp ; this is to be expected since the event topology for the trilepton signal assumes a stable , neutralino lsp .",
    "finally , on the @xmath131-axis is actually plotted @xmath111 , but in every case we examined with gaugino unification , the difference in the maximum masses of @xmath115 and @xmath116 differed by at most a few gev .",
    "this is because they are both dominantly wino - like in the unified case and thus have masses @xmath132 .",

    "what does the measurement of @xmath0 tell us with regards to our chances for seeing susy at @xmath134 ? and how many sparticles will be actually accessible to such a collider ?",
    "the analysis of the previous section can put a lower bound on the number of observable sparticles at a linear collider as a function of @xmath47 and @xmath2 and we show those numbers as a histogram in fig .",
    "[ nlchist ] . in this figure",

    "the thinner bars represent smaller @xmath2 .",
    "as is to be expected , the number of light states increases with increasing @xmath47 and with decreasing @xmath2 .",
    "however note that there are no @xmath136 lines for @xmath137 since there is no way to explain such large @xmath47 values at low @xmath2 .",
    "= 4.25 in    we see from the figure also that for @xmath138 there is no guarantee that a @xmath59 machine would produce on - shell sparticles ; this is not to be taken to mean that one should not expect their production , simply that @xmath0 can not guarantee it .",
    "however for @xmath133 , the @xmath1 limit on @xmath0 from e821 indicates that at least 2 to 3 sparticles will be accessible to a @xmath59 machine .",
    "this counting does not include extra sleptons due to slepton mass universality ; for example , a light muon sneutrino also implies light tau and electron sneutrinos , and likewise for the charged smuon .",
    "a similar bar graph can also be made for a @xmath139 machine , though we do not show it here .",
    "however the relevant numbers can be inferred from fig .",
    "[ massfig ] ; we see that such a machine is guaranteed to produce at least three sparticles for @xmath103 at the e821 @xmath1 limit .",
    "deviations in the muon anomalous magnetic moment have long been advertised as a key hunting ground for indirect signatures of susy . and it may be that we finally have the evidence we need in the @xmath13 deviation reported by e821 . if this signal is real and if susy is the correct explanation for it , then light sparticles are requisite . in this analysis ,",
    "we have confirmed , extended and overridden some of the bounds on these light sparticles that have appeared previously . in particular , for the @xmath1 lower bound on @xmath47 derived from the e821 data , we obtain the following for the most general mssm parametrization :    * there must be at least 4 sparticles with masses below @xmath3 ( @xmath22 for unified gauginos ) ; * the lightest sparticle must lie below @xmath4 ( @xmath140 for unified gauginos ) ; * there is no lower bound on @xmath2 ( the central value of the e821 data requires @xmath5 ) ; * the @xmath113 and the @xmath118 must lie below @xmath141 while one neutralino must fall below @xmath142 ( those bounds become @xmath143 and @xmath144 respectively for unified gauginos ) ; * there is no upper bound on @xmath111 ( the data s central value requires @xmath6 ) ; * if @xmath133 , then a @xmath59 linear collider is guaranteed to produce at least 2 sparticles , and run  ii / iii of the tevatron is likely to see a trilepton signature ( assuming a stable neutralino lsp ) ; for @xmath145 , neither of these can be guaranteed .    in the most interesting theoretical scenario ,  gaugino unification with a neutralino lsp , the bounds on susy masses can be much lower , with the neutralino lsp below @xmath146 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 below @xmath147 and sleptons below @xmath148 .",
    "our only important simplifications were to drop the dependence on @xmath68 from the smuon mixing matrices , and to assume slepton mass universality .",
    "if e821 has discovered evidence for susy , then it is clear that we have many more discoveries awaiting us .",
    "the current data implies that the lhc will find susy directly ; such a discovery for the tevatron or the nlc is not guaranteed , though the data on @xmath0 greatly enhances the likelihood that these programs will be successful .",
