    "a classical problem of classroom mechanics and military academies is the border of the so - called safe domain .",
    "a projectile is set off from a point @xmath0 with an initial velocity @xmath1 whose modulus is fixed by the intrinsic properties of the gun , while its direction can be varied arbitrarily .",
    "its is well - known that , in absence of air friction , each trajectory is a parabola , and that , in any vertical plane containing @xmath0 , the envelope of all trajectories is another parabola , which separates the points which can be shot from those which are out of reach .",
    "this will be shortly reviewed in sec .",
    "[ constant ] .",
    "amazingly , the problem of this envelope parabola can be addressed , and solved , in terms of elementary geometrical properties .    in elementary mechanics ,",
    "there are similar problems , that can be solved explicitly and lead to families of conic trajectories whose envelope is also a conic section .",
    "examples are the motion in a kepler or coulomb field , or in an harmonic potential",
    ". this will be the subject of secs .",
    "[ kepler ] and [ harmo ] .",
    "it is intriguing , that the property of ellipses unveiled by the case of the harmonic potential is not very well known ( following an e - mail survey around some mathematician colleagues ) , and is not easily proved by simple geometrical reasoning .",
    "it turns out , actually , that the mechanics problem provides one of the simplest sets of equations leading to the desired proof .",
    "this contrasts with the problem of kepler ellipses . here",
    ", the purely geometrical proof is astonishingly simple , and overcomes in efficiency and elegance the proof that can be written down by elementary calculus .",
    "it is hoped that students will be encouraged to carry out the solution to these problems from both a geometrical view point and a sober handling of the basic equations .",
    "kepler motion and other classical problems of elementary mechanics have been treated very elegantly in several textbooks and articles , a fraction of which insist convincingly on the geometrical aspects .",
    "it is impossible to quote here all relevant pieces of the literature .",
    "some recent articles @xcite allow one to trace back many previous contributions .",
    "in particular , the problem of the safe domain in a constant field is well treated in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the point of view of successive trajectories of varied initial angle and the point of view of simultaneous firing in all directions are both considered .",
    "the case of coulomb or kepler motion is treated in some detail by french @xcite , with references to earlier work by macklin , who used geometric methods .",
    "the case of rutherford scattering starting from infinite distance can be found , e.g. , in a paper by warner and huttar @xcite , and in ref .",
    "@xcite , while the case of finite initial distance is discussed in a paper by samengo and barrachina @xcite .",
    "hence , we shall include in our discussion the cases of constant force and inverse squared - distance force only for the sake of completeness .",
    "the envelope of ellipses in a harmonic potential is also treated in ref .",
    "@xcite , but with standard envelope calculus .",
    "the geometric approach presented here is new , at least to our knowledge .",
    "let us assume a constant force @xmath2 whose direction is chosen as the vertical axis .",
    "this can be realized as the gravitational field in ballistics , or an electric field acting on non - relativistic charged particles .",
    "it is sufficient to consider a meridian plane @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath4 denotes the angle of the initial velocity @xmath5 with respect to the @xmath6 axis , then the motion of a projectile fired from the origin @xmath0 is @xmath7      eliminating the time , @xmath8 , in eq .",
    "( [ c : eq : para1 ] ) , and introducing the natural length scale @xmath9 of the problem leads to the well - known parabola @xmath10 examples are shown in fig .  [ figpara1 ] .",
    "each trajectory is drawn for both positive and negative times , @xmath11 corresponding to the time of firing from @xmath0 .",
    "this is equivalent to putting together the trajectories corresponding to angles @xmath4 and @xmath12",
    ".    equation ( [ c : eq : para2 ] ) can now be seen from a different view point : given a point @xmath13 of coordinates @xmath6 and @xmath14 , is there any possibility to reach it with the gun ?",
    "the answer is known : nearby points , or points located downstream of the field can be reached twice , by a straight shot or a bell - like trajectory .",
    "points located far away , or too much upstream are , however , out of reach .",
    "the limit is the parabola @xmath15 as seen , e.g. , by writing ( [ c : eq : para2 ] ) as a second - order equation in @xmath16 and requiring its discriminant to vanish .",
    "this envelope is shown in fig .",
    "[ figpara1 ] .     a few trajectories corresponding to various shooting angles in a constant gravitational field , and their envelope ( dotted line ) . ]",
    "the parabolas ( [ c : eq : para2 ] ) have in common a point @xmath0 , and their directrix , @xmath17 , which is located at @xmath18 .",
    "the equation can , indeed , be read as @xmath19 revealing the focus @xmath20 located at @xmath21 , i.e. , on a circle , with centre at @xmath0 , of radius @xmath22 , at an angle @xmath23 with the horizontal .",

    "the equality is satisfied when @xmath13 , @xmath20 and @xmath0 are aligned . from @xmath23 , a result pointed out by macklin @xcite is recovered , that the tangent to the envelope is perpendicular to the initial velocity of the trajectory that is touched .",
    "( if @xmath13 is on the envelope , @xmath29 and the tangent is the inner bisector of @xmath30 . )",
    "a more peaceful view at the safe domain is that of an ideal firework : projectiles of various angle @xmath4 are fired all at once , with the same velocity @xcite . at a given time @xmath8 , they describe a circle ( a sphere in space ) @xmath31 with the centre at @xmath32 , i.e. , falling freely , and a growing radius @xmath33 .",
    "the problem of safety now consists of examining whether eq .  ( [ c : eq : circ1 ] ) has any solution in @xmath8 for given @xmath6 and @xmath14 .",
    "this is a mere second - order equation , whose vanishing discriminant leads back to the parabola ( [ c : eq : par3 ] ) .",
