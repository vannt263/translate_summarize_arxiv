    "@xmath1 multilayer systems are thought to be the next  generation magneto ",
    "optical recording media , because their performance is very similar to that of the rare  earth based materials , which are already in use@xmath2 .",
    "although , in the last decade a large amount of experimental investigations has been performed on these systems , realistic theoretical investigations , are still lacking up to now .",
    "the propagation of electromagnetic waves in any multilayer system can exactly be described by using either a @xmath3 matrix@xmath4 or @xmath5 matrix@xmath6 formalism . however , according to our knowledge , up to date , these techniques have been only used to simulate magneto  optical properties of multilayers using exclusively bulk optical data from experiments .",
    "the present contribution completes these kind of theoretical investigations . here",
    "the complex kerr effect is calculated on a first principle basis by using the theoretical layer  resolved optical conductivity tensor of the investigated layered system as input for the @xmath3 matrix formalism appropiate for polar geometry at normal incidence .",
    "the complex optical conductivity tensor is calculated using luttinger s formula@xmath7 by means of a contour integration technique@xmath8 , which permits the computation to be performed at nonzero temperatures and for finite life  time broadening . in combination with the spin ",
    "polarized relativistic screened korringa  kohn ",
    "rostoker band structure method@xmath9 , this technique has been shown to provide the most adequate first principles computational scheme of the complex optical conductivity tensor for layered systems , without using kramers  konig relations , taking into account , however , both , the inter and the intra  band contributions on the same footing@xmath10 .",
    "the computational accuracy is permanently controlled applying the gauss  konrod quadrature and the recently developed cumulative special  points method@xmath11 . in the present contribution ,",
    "all the layer  resolved complex optical conductivity tensors have been obtained with an accuracy of 0.001 a.u . by taking 35 ( 2 )",
    "matsubara poles at 300 k in the upper ( lower ) complex semi  plane and a life  time broadening of 0.048 ryd",
    ". the fermi level of -0.038 ryd corresponds to that of a paramagnetic fcc ",
    "pt bulk substrate ( lattice parameter of 7.4137 a.u . ) .",
    "the @xmath3 matrix formalism has been adopted for polar geometry at normal incidence , for two reasons , namely ( 1 ) kerr measurements are mainly recorded under these conditions@xmath12 ; and ( 2 ) in the case of polar geometry , the solutions of the characteristic equation are analytically known and hence within the iterative algorithm of mansuripur@xmath13 , the recursion relations are simple form .",
    "the form of @xmath3 matrices can even be more simplified by neglecting the difference in the diagonal optical conductivity tensor elements .",
    "starting from the substrate , once the surface reflectivity matrix has been iteratively evaluated , the kerr rotation angle @xmath14 and kerr ellipticity @xmath15 , respectively , are obtained directly by using the following exact formulas@xmath16 @xmath17 and @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the complex reflectivity of the right and left  handed circularly polarized light .",
    "the theoretical kerr spectra for fcc(111)@xmath20 layered system , with three pt cap layers and in addition with three @xmath21 bilayers in  between the cap layers and @xmath22 , respectively , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : moke - pmsub ] . in the experiments",
    "the pt cap layers on the top of co layer are deposited to prevent the oxidation of the surface@xmath23 .",
    "we have shown that strictly speaking the @xmath24 multilayer systems exhibit perpendicular magnetization only in presence of pt cap layers .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that due to the pt cap layers the kerr effect is enhanced in comparison with uncapped @xmath25 .",
    "the three @xmath26 bilayers on the top of @xmath20 increase dramatically the kerr effect , putting the theoretical kerr rotation angle in shape and magnitude in a very good agreement with the experimental data@xmath12 .",
    "however , because the systems considered here are much smaller than those used in experiments , a strict quantitative comparison of the kerr spectra can not directly be made .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     in conclusion , by combining our technique , which permits to obtain the layer ",
    "resolved optical conductivity tensor on a first principle basis , with a proper description of the light propagation in multilayer systems , like the @xmath3 matrix formalism , a very realistic description of the magneto  optical kerr effect can be given .",
