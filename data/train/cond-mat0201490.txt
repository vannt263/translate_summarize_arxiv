    "the nature of the ground - state of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) many - electron system in a perpendicular magnetic field has been for a number of years a subject of intense experimental and theoretical investigation . since the discovery of the integer and fractional quantum hall effects@xcite , this has been one of the richest sources of fundamental new physics in condensed matter . the transition from a liquid to a wigner crystal ( wc )",
    "state , originating from strong electron - electron correlations at low density in strong magnetic fields , has received considerable attention ( see _ e.g. _ ref . 2 and references given therein ) .",
    "more recently , novel and intriguing behaviors of 2d electron transport in high landau levels have been reported@xcite . in such regime of weak magnetic fields",
    "koulakov _ et al._@xcite predicted that charge density waves ( cdw ) would break the translational symmetry in one direction and form stripes .",
    "they also predicted stabilization of a novel 2d - cdw state with more that one electron per unit cell .",
    "such a `` bubble '' phase arising from spin - triplet electron pair formation and 2d lattice ordering has been confirmed in systematical numerical studies of haldane _",
    "et al._@xcite and of shibata and yoshioka@xcite .    in the present work",
    "we introduce a new possible low - temperature phase for a 2d electron system in a perpendicular magnetic field , namely a localized paired - electron state consisting of a spin - singlet electron pair in each cell , and investigate its stability at low densities against the more conventional wc state containing a single electron per cell .",
    "we have in mind situations where the zeeman splitting can be neglected@xcite . in free space , where the land @xmath3-factor of an electron is @xmath4 , the zeeman splitting is exactly equal to the cyclotron splitting .",
    "it turns out , however , that this is incorrect , for example , in a gaas heterostructure for the following reasons : ( i ) the small effective mass in the conduction band increases the cyclotron energy by a factor of @xmath5 ;",
    "( ii ) the effective coupling of the electron spin to the external magnetic field is reduced by spin - orbit scattering by a factor of @xmath6 , making the effective land factor @xmath7 .",
    "thus the zeeman energy is about @xmath8 times smaller than the cyclotron energy@xcite .",
    "this study has two main motivations .",
    "firstly , from the solution of the simple problem of two - electrons moving on a plane under parabolic confinement@xcite it emerges that the effective radial potential for the relative motion develops a pronounced minimum at sufficiently weak field .",
    "the minimum occurs even in the case of vanishing angular momentum ( @xmath9 ) and is the result of the competition between the coulomb repulsion and the localizing effects of the magnetic field and of the confinement .",
    "this feature may hide , in the many - body context and at sufficiently low electron densities , some new phase transition to a spin - singlet ( for @xmath9 ) paired electron state in weak magnetic fields .",
    "secondly , and following early work on a @xmath9 paired state in the 3d electron gas@xcite , such a state was found in a variational calculation@xcite to be a possible competitor to the conventional 3d - wc in zero field .",
    "a mixed spin state with a preference for spin pairing has been proposed to occur in some regions of the liquid phase from experiments on 2d electron systems in the ultra - quantum limit@xcite .",
    "in our evaluation of the energetics of the paired state we introduce an improved circular - cell approximation for an interacting 2d electron gas on a uniform positive background .",
    "we first study by this approach the conventional unpaired - electron wc state in a magnetic field@xcite .",
    "each electron is treated as a distributed charge cloud , which can be taken to a good approximation to be localized within a cell if the density is not too high and the field is not too small  the radius of the circular cell being available as an additional variational parameter@xcite .",
    "our results are in close agreement with those obtained in earlier approaches .",
    "we then adopt a similar method to deal with two interacting electrons within each circular cell .",
    "this yields new and more complex expressions leading to a window of thermodynamic stability for the paired - electron state at higher values of the electron density .",
    "the layout of the paper is briefly as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we present our treatment of the energy of the unpaired - electron 2d - wc in a magnetic field and compare our results with earlier ones and with the energy of the laughlin liquid state .",
    "section [ sec3 ] summarizes the main results for the problem of two electrons moving in a plane under an applied magnetic field .",
    "section [ sec4 ] reports our treatment of the singlet - paired state and section [ sec5 ] gives a variational calculation of the energy of this state and a determination of the phase boundary between the unpaired and the singlet - paired states .",
    "finally , section vi summarizes our main conclusions .",
    "some technical points of detail are worked out in an appendix .",
    "a 2d system of carriers in a pure semiconductor sample subject to a magnetic field @xmath10 is expected to undergo a transition to an ordered triangular lattice structure at sufficiently low temperature @xmath11 and filling factor @xmath0@xcite . here , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the areal carrier density and @xmath14 is the magnetic length .",
    "the ground - state energy of such a 2d - wc has been evaluated by a number of authors with various methods . in the following",
    "we shall indicate by @xmath15 the values of the ground - state energy after subtraction of the energy of the lowest landau level ( ll ) .",
    "the leading term of a low - density expansion is given by a classical madelung - potential calculation@xcite , leading to @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the dielectric constant of the host medium and @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 the effective rydberg and bohr radius .",
    "following early hartree - fock calculations@xcite and a classical - plasma simulation for the determination of the energy of the laughlin liquid@xcite , a variational calculation based on a correlated magnetophonon wave - function for the wc@xcite gave the result @xmath21 and predicted that the crystal energy would be lower than that of the liquid only at values of @xmath0 lower than @xmath22 .",
    "subsequent work by vignale@xcite used current - density functional theory in the projected local - density approximation and located the upper filling factor for the liquid - solid transition at @xmath1 , in fairly good agreement with the experimental evidence .    in our approach",
    "we model the 2d interacting electron system on a uniform positive background as a collection of non - interacting disks , each having a wigner - seitz radius @xmath23 to be eventually treated as a variational parameter and containing a single electron in a trial wave function with a variational width parameter @xmath24 .",
    "specifically , we adopt a gaussian trial wave function normalized to unity , @xmath25 the single - particle density thus is @xmath26 . taking the areal density of the background as @xmath27 , the total electronic charge inside the disk radius",
    "is determined by @xmath28 and we must require @xmath29 in order to avoid charge leakage errors . as noted by nagy@xcite , the handling of @xmath23 as a variational parameter ensures that the error involved in setting the electrical potential outside the disk to zero is minimized .",
    "the potential energy @xmath30 created by the positive background inside the circular cell is given in terms of the gauss hypergeometric function @xmath31 by@xcite @xmath32 this result is equivalent to the more familiar expression @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind ( see ref . , p. 591 ) .",
    "the self - interaction energy of the background is thus given by @xmath35 having used the result @xmath36 .",
    "similarly , the interaction energy of the electron with the background is @xmath37 for @xmath29 eq .",

    "this can be obtained in closed form , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the modified bessel function of the @xmath45-th order ( see appendix ) .",

    "we shall see below that the `` anharmonic corrections '' implied by eq .",

    "we have taken the vector potential in the symmetric gauge , @xmath53 , and used the fact that the wave function ( [ prima ] ) is an isotropic state of zero angular momentum .",

    "equation ( [ tot ] ) , after insertion of eqs .",
    "( [ ture ] ) , ( [ cm ] ) and ( [ megane ] ) is minimized numerically with respect to the variational parameters @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the equilibrium values of these parameters are shown in figure [ fig1 ] as functions of @xmath60 for two values of the magnetic field .",
    "the ratio @xmath61 should be appreciably smaller than unity for internal self - consistency and the extent to which this consistency criterion is satisfied is shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "it is evident from figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] that for these values of the field the harmonic approximation is applicable for the estimation of the variational parameters whenever the consistency criterion @xmath62 is satisfied .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] reports our results for the ground - state energy @xmath63 as a function of the filling factor in the lowest ll , after subtraction of the kinetic energy @xmath64 from the total energy @xmath65 and rescaling to @xmath66 energy units .",
    "the left panel in figure [ fig3 ] shows that @xmath63 in these units is still weakly dependent on the field intensity at values of @xmath0 larger than about @xmath67 .",
    "the right panel in figure [ fig3 ] compares our results for @xmath63 in the range @xmath68 with those obtained in the correlated wigner crystal approach of lam and girvin@xcite ( see eq .",
    "( [ cwc ] ) ) .",
    "it is also seen that the classical limit of bonsall and maradudin@xcite is approximately recovered for @xmath69 .",
    "it is also seen from figure [ fig3 ] ( left panel ) that the ground - state energy of the unpaired wc as obtained in the present approach crosses the energy of the laughlin liquid as reported by levesque _",
    "et al._@xcite at @xmath70 .",
    "this value for the upper critical filling factor of the liquid - solid transition agrees with that reported by vignale@xcite and , as discussed by this author , there is strong experimental evidence supporting the fact that the crystal exists even at filling factors as large as @xmath71-@xmath72@xcite .",
    "however , again as discussed by vignale , it appears that the liquid - solid transition is not a simple crossing of two phases occuring at a single value of @xmath0 .",
    "rather , it shows a complex reentrant behavior , with the liquid phase being stable at or near the fractional quantum hall effect fractions and the solid phase being stable in between .",
    "we would also like to remark that the simple choice @xmath73 , which ensures that the wigner - seitz cell is electrically neutral , implies only small changes relative to the prescription proposed by nagy@xcite .",
    "we in fact find that when we take @xmath73 the critical filling factor at which the liquid - solid transition occurs shifts from @xmath70 to @xmath74 .    finally , we briefly comment on the issue of landau level mixing ( llm ) , as studied in detail by zhu and louie@xcite and by price",
    "_ et al._@xcite .",
    "llm is important when the ratio between the magnetic energy ( of order @xmath75 ) and the coulomb energy ( of order @xmath76 ) becomes smaller then unity , _ i.e. _ for @xmath77 .",
    "this effect is included in our approach through the use of a trial wave function having a variational width@xcite and becomes unimportant as @xmath60 increases and @xmath78 approaches the value @xmath79 for which eq .",
    "( [ prima ] ) becomes the exact lowest - energy eigenfunction of the single - particle hamiltonian .",
    "this asymptotic behavior is clearly seen from figure [ fig1 ] ( left panel ) .",
    "having assessed numerically the range of validity of the harmonic approximation ( ha ) for the estimation of the model variational parameters , we proceed to report a number of analytic results which follow from it .",

    "( [ ha ] ) with respect to @xmath81 and @xmath82 yields the results shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",

    "( [ a1 ] ) , @xmath93 while @xmath94 converges with increasing @xmath60 to the value @xmath95 ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "that is , nagy s",

    "the expression for the ground - state energy becomes @xmath97\\ , ryd^{*}\\ , .\\ ] ] however , this simple analytic expression for the energy of the unpaired wc in a magnetic field is not sufficiently accurate on the energy scale needed for the comparisons made in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "in this section we motivate the introduction of a paired state for the wc by discussing the spin - singlet ground - state and effective interaction potential for two electrons moving in a plane under a perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "as is known from the work of taut@xcite , this is an example of a quasi - exactly soluble problem with a hidden @xmath98-algebraic structure@xcite : an exact solution exists for special values of the field .",
    "our aim will be to use the analytic form of the wave function determined in such a case in order to make a reasonable _ ansatz _ for the variational treatment which will be developed for the paired phase in the next section .",

    "two main points of this two - electron problem need emphasizing .",
    "firstly , the effective potential @xmath119 entering the schr \" odinger equation for the reduced wave function @xmath120 at @xmath121 is @xmath122 and develops a minimum for @xmath123 ( see figure [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "this fact will motivate the introduction of the paired phase in the next section .",
    "secondly , in a solid semiconducting medium the parameter @xmath118 becomes @xmath124 @xmath118 being the vacuum value .",
    "thus , using @xmath125  and the values @xmath126 and @xmath127 for a gaas heterostructure , we find that the minimum is present in @xmath128 for all values of magnetic field _ lower _ than @xmath129 tesla .",
    "we return to the circular cell model to develop a variational approach to the total energy in the case of a localized paired phase in a spin - singlet configuration .",
    "two electrons are placed inside each disk of radius @xmath23 , the pair wave function being taken in the form @xmath130 where @xmath131 and @xmath24 are variational parameters and @xmath132 is a normalization constant . the single - pair case treated in section [ sec3 ] is recovered by setting @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "notice that the relative motion of the two electrons is described in eq .",
    "( [ tr ] ) by a gaussian factor times a linear superposition of the hermite polynomials of zeroth and first order : thus the _ ansatz _ ( [ tr ] ) allows level mixing due to the electron - electron interactions and is the natural extension of the variational - width method used for the unpaired phase in section [ sec2 ] .",

    "( [ vale ] ) .",
    "finally the contribution @xmath151 in eq .",
    "( [ 30 ] ) is given by @xmath152 the center - of - mass and relative motion states and hamiltonians being immediately obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ hh ] ) and ( [ tr ] ) .",

    "it depends on the three variational parameters @xmath58 , @xmath154 and @xmath131 .",
    "the equilibrium values of @xmath81 and @xmath82 as functions of @xmath60 show the same trends as displayed in figure [ fig1 ] for the unpaired phase .",
    "however , the asymptotic value of @xmath155 for an electron pair is reduced by a factor of @xmath156 and that of @xmath94 is @xmath157 , increased by a factor @xmath156 over the unpaired state as one expects from the double occupancy of the cell .",
    "internal consistency of the theory is ensured by the ratio @xmath158 being smaller than about @xmath159 , both in the full calculation and in the harmonic approximation , for values of @xmath160 and of the field @xmath161 tesla .",
    "the equilibrium value of @xmath131 as a function of @xmath60 is displayed in figure [ fig4 ] for two values of the field .",
    "the two electrons in each cell are pushed closer together as the magnetic field increases , leading from eq .",
    "( [ 28 ] ) to a decrease of @xmath162 with increasing field as is shown in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] reports the energy @xmath163 of the paired phase ( that is , after subtraction of the kinetic energy in the lowest ll and reduction to @xmath164 energy units ) as a function of the filling factor extending up to @xmath165 .",
    "the residual dependence of @xmath163 on the magnetic field extends into the high-@xmath60 ( low-@xmath0 ) regime , as illustrated in the inset in figure [ fig5 ] on a magnified scale , and a finite value is attained by @xmath163 as @xmath166 .",
    "these features are a consequence of the coulomb interaction between the two electrons inside each cell .",
    "the result in figure [ fig6 ] have been fitted to the functional form @xmath167 , where @xmath168 the values of the coefficients in this fitting formula are reported in table [ table1 ] for various values of the magnetic field .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] compares the energies per electron of the unpaired and paired phases as functions of @xmath60 .",
    "the two curves cross at two values of @xmath60 for each value of the field , but the crossing at lower @xmath60 is to be discarded as it corresponds to situations where charge leakage out of the circular cell is unacceptably high ( @xmath169 ) .",
    "the conclusion from the physically significant crossing at larger @xmath60 , therefore , is that at each value of the magnetic field in the range from @xmath170 to @xmath171 tesla the paired phase becomes stable relative to the unpaired one as @xmath60 decreases .    from the location of the physically acceptable crossing of the energies of the two phases in figure [ fig7 ] we obtain their phase boundary in the @xmath172 plane , which is reported in figure [ fig8 ] .",
    "this shows a region of thermodynamic stability for the paired phase ( at least relative to the unpaired one ) in the left portion of the plane , before charge leakage outside the cell boundary is expected to occur in an important way so that the model becomes unreliable ( to the left of the dash - dotted line in the figure ) . within numerical accuracy",
    "we find that the boundary between the two phases is actually set by the @xmath173 line in the plane@xcite .",
    "therefore , the present simple model predicts that electron clusterization may occur only in landau levels above the lowest one .",
    "of course , the unpaired state in the @xmath174 region ( on the right of the @xmath173 line ) could become stable against the laughlin liquid only for @xmath175 , as already discussed in connection with figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "we should emphasize that the ground - state energy difference that we estimate between the paired and the unpaired state is quite appreciable as long as the magnetic field intensity lies in the range that we have illustrated in our calculations .",
    "the difference decreases with the field intensity , so that more refined calculations would be needed at low fields .",
    "we have presented a variational study which approximately accounts for the ground - state energetics of a 2d many - electron system with coulomb interactions at low density and in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "the method consists of an improved 2d version of the well - known spherical cell approximation and is applied to two distinct situations , a single - electron state and a spin - singlet paired state . for the former it gives new analytical and numerical results which are in close agreement with the state - of - the - art calculations on the 2d wigner crystal .",
    "the evaluation of the spin - paired state has been motivated by previous studies and suggests that this state may be stable in a range of system parameters corresponding to landau levels above the lowest one .",
    "it remains to be seen whether such a paired state would be confirmed in more sophisticated treatments allowing in particular for inter - cell corrections .",
    "it may be also emphasized at this point that we have not examined the stability of the spin - singlet paired state against the emergence of spin - polarized states .",
    "evidence from measurements of knight shift of the @xmath176 nuclei in n - doped gaas@xcite indicates that this quantity , which is proportional to the spin polarization , drops precipitously on either side of @xmath173 , which is evidence that the charged excitations of the @xmath173 ground state are finite - size skyrmions .",

    "<S> we present a variational study of both unpaired and spin - singlet paired states induced in a two - dimensional electron gas at low density by a perpendicular magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> it is based on an improved circular - cell approximation which leads to a number of closed analytical results . </S>",
    "<S> the ground - state energy of the wigner crystal containing a single electron per cell in the lowest landau level is obtained as a function of the filling factor @xmath0 : the results are in good agreement with those of earlier approaches and predict @xmath1 for the upper filling factor at which the solid - liquid transition occurs . </S>",
    "<S> a novel localized state of spin - singlet electron pairs is examined and found to be a competitor of the unpaired state for filling factor @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding phase boundary is quantitatively displayed in the magnetic field - electron density plane . </S>"
