    "the interface between galaxies and the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is to examine the spectra of bright background objects for absorption features at the redshifts of foreground galaxies .",

    "a crucial requirement for the success of such studies is the availability of accurate redshifts for the foreground galaxies . to illustrate this point , we note that observationally inferred outflow velocities correspond to a change in redshift of order @xmath11 and that at @xmath12 the difference in hubble velocity across a proper distance of 1  mpc , which exceeds the virial radius of the typical star - forming galaxy at that redshift by more than an order of magnitude , corresponds to @xmath13 . clearly , the systematic errors on the redshifts of foreground objects need to be @xmath14 in order to map the physical properties of the gas in and around the haloes of galaxies .",
    "the most accurate galaxy redshifts are measured from absorption lines arising in stellar atmospheres .",
    "rest - frame optical stellar absorption features are routinely detected in spectra of galaxies in the local universe . for high-@xmath15 galaxies rest - frame uv",
    "stellar absorption lines are detectable in stacks of @xmath16 high - quality spectra and have been used to verify the accuracy of redshift calibrations @xcite .",
    "one can also measure accurate redshifts from nebular emission lines from stellar hii regions .",
    "lines such as h@xmath0 ( @xmath176563 ) , h@xmath18 ( @xmath174861 ) , and [ ] ( @xmath194959 , 5007 ) are strong and easily accessible for galaxies in the nearby universe because they are in the rest - frame optical .",
    "measuring redshifts from these lines is , however , more difficult for high-@xmath15 galaxies .",
    "nebular lines are redshifted into the observed frame near - infrared , and at these wavelengths spectroscopy with ground based instruments is complicated by the bright night - sky , as well as by strong absorption features produced by molecules in the earth s atmosphere .",
    "the prospects for near - ir spectroscopy , at least for bright objects , will improve when multi - object near - ir spectrographs come online ( e.g. keck i / mosfire ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but near - ir spectroscopy will remain challenging for fainter objects .",
    "alternatively , one may resort to measuring redshifts using spectral lines that lie in the rest - frame uv and can thus be observed with optical spectrographs .",
    "such lines include the ly@xmath0 emission line at 1216 , when present , and uv absorption lines arising in the interstellar medium , of which the strongest are ( @xmath171335 ) , ( @xmath171394 ) , and ( @xmath171527 ) . however , these lines are not ideal as they do not provide accurate redshift measurements .",
    "ly@xmath0 photons are resonantly scattered , and the observed line profile depends on the kinematics and the amount of gas that is scattering the photons , as well as on the dust content ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the observed velocities of interstellar absorption lines also depend on the kinematics of the gas that produces them .",
    "most high - redshift galaxies observable with current facilities have sufficiently high star formation rates to drive galactic scale winds .",
    "these winds carry some interstellar material out of the galaxies and this causes both the ly@xmath0 emission line and interstellar absorption lines to be systematically offset by a few hundred @xmath20 from the galaxy systemic redshifts , as measured from nebular lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in surveys of high - redshift ( @xmath21 ) star - forming galaxies ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite dealt with these issues by measuring redshifts from rest - frame uv lines , obtaining near - ir spectroscopy for a subset ( @xmath22 ) of galaxies , and then calibrating the redshifts measured from rest - frame uv lines using the rest - frame optical nebular lines .",
    "this calibration was then applied to the rest of the sample that lacked near - ir spectroscopy .",
    "however , galaxy populations other than lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) may require their own calibrations .",
    "this is a problem as calibration using nebular lines is often not possible .",
    "for example , most of the galaxies found by future surveys with integral field spectrographs , such as the multi unit spectroscopic explorer ( muse , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , will only be detected in ly@xmath0 .",
    "also , even for the lbgs at @xmath21 it is possible that the subsample that is observed in the near - ir is not quite representative of the whole sample , for example because galaxies need to be sufficiently bright to do near - ir spectroscopy .    in this paper",
    "we present and apply a method for calibrating redshifts measured from rest - frame uv lines using the absorption features from the surrounding igm as seen in the spectra of background qsos .",
    "several studies have found that the mean strength of ly@xmath0 absorption increases as the distance to the nearest galaxy decreases ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "by using the fact that the mean absorption profiles must be symmetric with respect to the systemic galaxy redshifts if the galaxies are oriented randomly with respect to the lines of sight to the background qsos , we determine the optimal average velocity offset for which the observed mean absorption profile is symmetric around the positions of the galaxies along the line of sight ( los ) .",
    "although the same principle was used to verify the accuracy of the calibrations proposed in @xcite and @xcite , this is the first time that the igm absorption is used for calibration itself .",
    "the use of absorption by the igm makes the method independent of the galaxies luminosities , and does not require rest - frame optical observations .",
    "we find that the required offsets for redshifts based on ism absorption lines and ly@xmath0 emission lines agree with the calibrations inferred by direct comparison with nebular line redshifts .",
    "using this method we also confirm that different galaxy subsamples require different calibrations depending on the galaxies spectral morphology .    throughout this work we use @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 @xcite . unless stated otherwise , all distances are proper .",
    "the data sample used in this study is partially ( 3 out of 15 fields ) described in steidel et al .",
    "( 2003 ; 2004 ) , @xcite , and @xcite , while the full survey will be presented elsewhere . here",
    "we give only a brief description .",
    "this redshift survey was constructed to select galaxies whose @xmath26 colors are consistent with star - forming galaxies at redshifts @xmath27 .",
    "the survey was conducted in 15 fields with typical size @xmath28 , centred on bright background qsos for which there were high - resolution spectra suitable for probing lyman-@xmath0 absorbing gas in the same redshift range .",
    "the technique for optically selecting galaxies is described in detail in adelberger et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ( their bx / bm sample ) .",
    "all 659 galaxies used here have been followed up spectroscopically with the optical spectrograph keck i / lris - b ( fwhm @xmath29 ; * ? ? ?",
    "a subset of 49 galaxies has been observed with the near - ir spectrograph keck ii / nirspec @xcite at a higher resolution ( fwhm @xmath30 ) than achieved by lris - b ( see * ? ? ? * for details on this galaxy sample ) .",
    "the sample used here is part of a larger sample , with a few thousand galaxies , from which we selected all galaxies within 2 mpc from the los to the background qsos , and with redshifts that fall in the ly@xmath0 forest redshift ranges of the qsos in their fields .",
    "we define the ly@xmath0 forest range as the part of the spectrum between the quasar s ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath18 emission lines , excluding the region @xmath31 from the quasar s redshift ( to avoid the proximity zone ) .",
    "the qso observations were conducted between 1996 and 2009 with the keck i / hires echelle spectrograph .",
    "the spectra have a resolution of @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) and were rebinned into pixels of 0.04 .",
    "they cover the wavelength range @xmath34 .",
    "the reduction was done using t. barlow s makee package , and the spectra were normalized using low order spline fits .",
    "the typical s / n in the ly@xmath0 forest region lies between 40 and 160 .",
    "repeated observations of the same galaxies suggest that the typical statistical measurement uncertainties are @xmath35 for redshifts measured from ism absorption lines ( @xmath36 ) , @xmath37 for redshifts measured from ly@xmath0 emission lines ( @xmath38 ) , and @xmath39 for redshifts measured from nebular emission lines ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "the systematic offsets between these redshifts and the true ( i.e.  systemic ) redshifts , which is the subject of this paper , may of course be larger .",
    "absorption spectra of background objects ( qsos , grbs , or star - forming galaxies ) can be used to study the intervening igm .",
    "observations generally show an increase in the mean ly@xmath0 and metal absorption as the distance to the nearest galaxy decreases .",
    "one expects to find an average absorption profile that is symmetric around the galaxies positions along the los .",
    "this is true even if the igm is not distributed isotropically around galaxies , which can for example occur if the mean absorption at a given distance from a galaxy correlates with the galaxy s inclination . assuming that the galaxies are oriented randomly with respect to the los",
    ", we still expect to see a symmetric absorption profile when averaged over an ensemble of galaxies redshift than the red side , and the mean ly@xmath0 absorption at a random location is known to increase with redshift , we do expect the intergalactic ly@xmath0 absorption to be slightly weaker on the blue side .",
    "however , the magnitude of this effect ( the mean transmission varies by 0.002 over @xmath41 at @xmath42 ; e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is negligible compared to the enhancement in the mean absorption near galaxies . ] .",
    "if the measured redshifts of galaxies are systematically offset from their systemic redshifts , then the mean profile will be symmetric around some other velocity point , offset from the observed redshift by an amount equal to the systematic shift in galaxy redshifts ( see fig .",
    "[ drawing ] for an illustration ) . in this paper",
    "we use this principle to calibrate the systematic offsets between the observed and systemic ( i.e. true ) redshifts for the galaxies in our sample .",
    "one could imagine that instead of measuring the offset from the average absorption profile , we could measure offsets for individual galaxies by observing the igm absorption features around them , and then find the average of such estimated offsets .",
    "however , near the redshift of a galaxy one often finds several lines at different velocities , of which some are associated with the galaxy in question , but the others are produced by , for example , a cloud that is associated with a neighboring galaxy or an intervening cloud . if the absorption line associated with such a cloud were stronger than that due to the gas associated with the galaxy , then we would infer the wrong offset . also , at small impact parameters even a cloud that is associated with the galaxy in question could potentially have kinematics that is not dominated by gravity ( e.g. , it could be a part of the galactic outflow ) ; and at any point in the forest there could be absorption completely unrelated to the observed redshift .",
    "this is not a problem when using the average absorption profile , given that it is equally likely for such a line to be at a positive as at a negative velocity with respect to the galaxy .",
    "we use ly@xmath0 rather than metal lines , because the metal - line absorption is usually only enhanced within a couple of hundred kpc from galaxies , and our sample does not include a sufficiently large number of galaxies with such small impact parameters ( see the discussion below on the required number of galaxies ) .",
    "however , at higher redshifts , where the ly@xmath0 forest starts to saturate , it might be advantageous to use metal lines , as long as the survey contains sufficient galaxies .",
    "we compare the `` blue '' and `` red '' sides of the median ly@xmath0 absorption profile , within @xmath43 of the galaxy redshifts of all the foreground galaxies with impact parameters , @xmath44 , smaller than 2 mpc .",
    "we try a large number of velocity offsets , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the observed redshift , and @xmath47 is the speed of light . note that a positive @xmath48 indicates that the observed redshifts systematically underestimate the true redshifts.we verified that there is no justification for using a redshift dependent offset  either because our redshift range is too small for evolution to matter ( @xmath49 ) , or because there is no dependence on redshift in this galaxy population .",
    "the analysis involves the following steps : _",
    "i ) we assume that the observed redshifts are systematically offset from the systemic redshifts by @xmath48 and assign each galaxy a new redshift @xmath50 ; _ ii ) for each galaxy we shift the qso spectrum into the galaxy s rest - frame ; _ iii ) for each galaxy we interpolate the flux in the qso spectrum within @xmath51 from @xmath52 in velocity bins of @xmath53 to get an absorption profile ; _ iv ) we find the median flux profile as a function of velocity separation from galaxies ; _ v ) we compare the `` blue '' ( @xmath54 ) and the `` red '' ( @xmath55 ) side of the median flux profile using @xmath56 statistics : @xmath57 where b@xmath58 and r@xmath58 are the blue and red median flux arrays , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the errors on the median flux , and the sum extends over all velocity bins within @xmath61 from the assumed redshifts .",
    "the errors on the median flux profiles are estimated by bootstrap resampling .",
    "we recreated the galaxy sample 1000 times by dividing each qso field into redshift bins of @xmath62 and then randomly drawing redshift intervals to recreate each field , allowing for individual intervals to be selected multiple times .",
    "each bootstrapped galaxy sample consists of galaxies whose redshifts fall in the selected redshift intervals .",
    "we chose an interval of @xmath62 because this length is larger than the correlation length of lbgs @xcite .",
    "these five steps are repeated for a large number of assumed redshift offsets , yielding a reduced @xmath63 curve ( see fig .",
    "[ emism1d ] ) .",
    "we expect the @xmath56 to reach a ( local ) minimum for the offset that brings the measured redshifts closest to the true redshifts .",
    "note that the @xmath56 will also have a small value if the applied redshift offsets are very large , because in that case the absorption will no longer be correlated with the assumed locations of galaxies , the median flux profile will be flat , and the blue and red sides will agree .",
    "we therefore search for @xmath56 minima only between the inferred @xmath56 maxima ( see fig .",
    "[ emism1d ] for the characteristic shape of the @xmath56 curves ) . in practice",
    "we do this as follows : _",
    "i ) _ we smooth the @xmath56 curve with a boxcar average with @xmath64 width ; _ ii ) _ we find the global @xmath56 maximum and determine the fwhm of the @xmath63 peak it belongs to ; _ iii ) _ we search for the second ( local ) @xmath56 maximum that is at least one fwhm away from the first one ; _ iv ) _ we find the @xmath56 minimum between these two peaks , in the un - smoothed curve .",
    "_ _ _ _ _    the value that we chose for the maximum impact parameter , @xmath65 , is a compromise between the need for a strong absorption signal ( the mean absorption is stronger for galaxies with smaller impact parameters ) , and the need for a large number of galaxies ( there are more galaxies with larger impact parameters ) .",
    "we verified that using smaller maximum impact parameters gives consistent results .",
    "any maximum impact parameter in the range to test smaller maximum impact parameters .",
    "] 0.5 - 2 mpc yields redshift calibrations that agree with those obtained for the @xmath66 sample within the estimated errors .",
    "however , the required number of galaxies does depend on the adopted maximum impact parameter . for @xmath67 and @xmath66 , we obtain converged results if we use @xmath68 and @xmath69 galaxies , respectively , although the error bar on the inferred systematic shift continues to decrease slowly if more galaxies are included .",
    "we also varied the velocity range around each galaxy . in this case",
    "there is a tradeoff between the strength of the signal and the number of pixels available for statistics .",
    "we found that the velocity range of @xmath51 generally gives the tightest confidence intervals around the estimated offsets , but the results are insensitive to the precise velocity range chosen .",
    "we apply the above method to our sample and estimate systematic velocity shifts for the subsamples listed in fig .",
    "[ comparisonexclms_short ] .",
    "we make a distinction between the whole sample and the nirspec subsample due to the possibility that this subset is not representative of the whole sample ( see * ? ? ? * for details on the sample selection and possible biases ) .",
    "in fig .  [ emism1d ] we plot the reduced @xmath56 as a function of the assumed velocity offset .",
    "we find that the best offset for redshifts measured from ly@xmath0 emission is @xmath3 ( i.e. , the ly@xmath0 emission line is systematically redshifted with respect to the systemic velocity ) , while for redshifts measured from ism absorption lines we find @xmath4 ( i.e. , the ism absorption lines are systematically blueshifted ) .",
    "we estimated the confidence intervals around the best estimates for @xmath9 or @xmath10 using the bootstrap method , described in section  [ method ] .",
    "we perform all the steps described in section  [ method ] on samples created by bootstrapping the original sample , resulting in a best - fit @xmath48 for each bootstrap realization of the galaxy sample .",
    "the error on the estimate of @xmath48 is the @xmath70 confidence interval around the median @xmath48 from the 1000 bootstrap realizations .",
    "these 1@xmath5 confidence intervals are shown as the light blue shaded regions in fig .",
    "[ emism1d ] together with the @xmath56 curve .",
    "we prefer to determine confidence intervals by using bootstrap resampling rather than @xmath71 because the former is more robust .",
    "indeed , we found that for small galaxy samples the @xmath56 curves become too noisy for @xmath71 estimates to work , while for large samples they yield errors slightly larger than those estimated from bootstrap resampling .",
    "contrary to @xmath71 , bootstrap resampling does not require the errors on the median flux profile to be gaussian .",
    "it also does not require the different velocity bins to provide independent measurements , which they in fact do not because the individual absorption lines are broader than the bins in @xmath48 .",
    "bootstrap resampling merely requires that the redshift regions into which we divide the fields are independent , which is true since , as already mentioned , they are larger than the galaxies correlation length .",
    "we thus only use the @xmath56 curve to find the @xmath48 that minimizes the difference between the blue and red sides .    for the subset of galaxies with near - ir data ,",
    "the nebular lines provide accurate markers of the systemic redshifts of the individual galaxies . comparing these with the rest - frame uv lines , we find median offsets of @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( based on 42 and 86 galaxies , respectively , including objects that are not within 2  mpc of the los to a qso ) .",
    "the quoted uncertainties correspond to the 1@xmath5 confidence interval around the median , estimated by bootstrap resampling the galaxy sample 1000 times .",
    "these results are shown as red polygons in fig .",

    "mean offsets of @xmath75 and @xmath76 . while our result for @xmath77 agrees with the direct estimate ,",
    "the best estimates for @xmath10 differ significantly .",
    "we therefore employ our igm calibration method for the subsample with nebular redshifts .",
    "for ly@xmath0 the resulting offset is @xmath78 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the direct estimate ( @xmath72 ) from nebular lines for the same galaxies .",
    "both disagree with our measurement for the full sample ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "we emphasize that our measurement of @xmath10 for the near - ir sample is based on only 26 galaxies , which is generally insufficient to obtain a converged result . indeed",
    ", we find that our method fails for the subsample of 48 galaxies with both ism absorption and nebular emission lines .",
    "the reduced @xmath63 curve is noisy and does not show two clear peaks , which causes the best - fit velocity offset to vary strongly with the velocity interval over which we measure the median flux .",
    "although the @xmath63 curve for the subsample of near - ir galaxies with ly@xmath0 emission does look normal and we found the result to be insensitive to the precise velocity interval used , the number of galaxies may well be too small to obtain a robust measurement .",
    "galaxies whose redshifts have been measured only from their ly@xmath0 emission feature tend to be those with poorer continuum s / n , due either to faintness or to poor observing conditions .",
    "such galaxies are under - represented in the near - ir subsample because their redshifts are considered less secure and therefore were selected against for near - ir spectroscopic follow - up @xcite .",
    "it has also been observed that the velocity offset of ly@xmath0 emission is anti - correlated with the ly@xmath0 equivalent width @xcite  stronger ly@xmath0 lines are expected to have velocities closer to the galaxy systemic redshift .",
    "these two effects are likely responsible for the differences between the full sample and the smaller near - ir subsample .",
    "this difference sends a warning that describing a galaxy population with a single number is not the best strategy given that the line offsets depend on galaxy spectral morphology .",
    "thus , conclusions drawn from the near - ir subsample may not be generally applicable and separate redshift calibrations are needed for each sample of interest .",
    "however , we do confirm the finding from @xcite that absorption line offsets are less sensitive to galaxy spectral morphology than ly@xmath0 emission line offsets .",
    "this justifies the strategy taken in @xcite and @xcite to use redshifts measured from ism absorption lines when they are available ( @xmath79 of the sample ) .    as an additional test of our igm calibration method",
    ", we measure the systematic velocity offset for redshifts measured from nebular emission lines , which are known to be close to systemic positions .",
    "the resulting offset , which is based on a sample of 49 galaxies , is @xmath80 , i.e. consistent with zero , as expected ( fig .",
    "[ comparisonexclms_short ] ) .",
    "we have demonstrated that one can use the fact that ly@xmath0 absorption by the igm is correlated with proximity to galaxies to calibrate the redshifts inferred from ly@xmath0 emission and ism absorption lines . in other words",
    ", we measured the systematic offsets in the observed redshifts .",
    "we will now use the same idea to constrain the statistical ( i.e.  random ) offsets .",
    "statistical scatter in individual galaxy redshift offsets may be caused by measurement and instrumental errors , but in our case it is probably dominated by the variations in the intrinsic galaxy properties . by comparing redshifts inferred from rest - frame uv lines with those from nebular lines for the subset of 89 galaxies that have been observed in the near - ir , one not only finds a large systematic offset , but there is also a significant scatter of @xmath81 for ly@xmath0 redshifts , and @xmath82 for ism redshifts .",
    "we use all galaxies with impact parameters smaller than 2 mpc , and measure the median absorption around them .",
    "we then repeat the procedure after applying a random redshift offset to the redshift of each galaxy , drawn from a gaussian distribution with mean zero and standard deviation @xmath5 .",
    "we do this many times for increasing values of @xmath5 .",
    "we then compare the resulting median flux profiles with the original ( i.e.  @xmath83 ) median absorption profile .",
    "we expect that the two profiles will be consistent with each other as long as the added random offsets are small compared with the true random offsets . using this method",
    "we obtain 1@xmath5 upper limits on the random redshift offsets of @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) for ly@xmath0 redshifts , using mean ( median ) statistics , and @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) for ism redshifts , which is consistent with the independent estimates based on the subsample with redshifts from nebular lines .",
    "the quoted values are upper limits because we measure the amount of scatter needed to cause a significant difference with respect to the original absorption profile , i.e. the value we find exceeds the actual scatter that is present in the sample .",
    "measuring accurate redshifts for high-@xmath15 galaxies is a daunting task .",
    "distant objects are faint , making even ground - based rest - frame uv observations challenging . added to this",
    "is the complexity of the gas kinematics and radiation transport , which may cause absorption and emission features to be systematically offset from the true systemic redshifts .",

    "by utilizing the fact that the mean absorption profiles must be symmetric with respect to the true galaxy redshifts if the galaxies are oriented randomly with respect to the los , we calibrated the redshifts measured from rest - frame uv spectral lines .",
    "our results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ comparisonexclms_short ] .",
    "we found that observed ly@xmath0 emission redshifts require a systematic shift of @xmath3 ( i.e.  the ly@xmath0 lines are redshifted with respect to the systemic velocity ) and that ism absorption redshifts need an offset of @xmath4 ( i.e.  the ism lines are blueshifted ) .",
    "for the nebular lines we found @xmath89 , which is consistent with zero , as expected .",
    "we compared our calibrations to those obtained by direct comparison with nebular emission lines , which should be close to systemic , for a subsample observed with nirspec / keck . while our measurements for @xmath9 agree , the direct measurement for the systematic offset of the ly@xmath0 emission line , @xmath72 , differs significantly .",
    "however , when we applied our method to the nirspec subsample we found @xmath78 , in agreement with the direct measurement .",
    "the discrepancy between the ly@xmath0 offsets between the near - ir subsample and the full sample reflects the fact that the line offset depends on galaxy spectral morphology , which is different for the nirspec subsample due to the way in which these galaxies were selected .",
    "after having demonstrated that one can use igm absorption to measure systematic galaxy redshift offsets , we also estimated upper limits on the random offsets for individual galaxies . in our case",
    "these random offsets are likely dominated by intrinsic scatter rather than by measurement errors .",

    "<S> rest - frame uv spectral lines of star - forming galaxies are systematically offset from the galaxies systemic redshifts , probably because of large - scale outflows . </S>",
    "<S> we calibrate galaxy redshifts measured from rest - frame uv lines by utilizing the fact that the mean ly@xmath0 absorption profiles around the galaxies , as seen in spectra of background objects , must be symmetric with respect to the true galaxy redshifts if the galaxies are oriented randomly with respect to the lines of sight to the background objects . </S>",
    "<S> we use 15 bright qsos at @xmath1 and more than 600 foreground galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts at @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> all galaxies are within 2 mpc proper from the lines of sight to the background qsos . </S>",
    "<S> we find that ly@xmath0 emission and ism absorption redshifts require systematic shifts of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> assuming a gaussian distribution , we put 1@xmath5 upper limits on possible random redshift offsets of @xmath6 for ly@xmath0 and @xmath7 for ism redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> for the small subset ( @xmath8 percent ) of galaxies for which near - ir spectra have been obtained , we can compare our results to direct measurements based on rest - frame optical , nebular emission lines , which we confirm to mark the systemic redshifts . while our @xmath9 agrees with the direct measurements , our @xmath10 is significantly smaller . </S>",
    "<S> however , when we apply our method to the near - ir subsample which is characterized by slightly different selection effects , the best - fit velocity offset comes into agreement with the direct measurement . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms the validity of our approach , and implies that no single number appropriately describes the whole population of galaxies , in line with the observation that the line offset depends on galaxy spectral morphology . </S>",
    "<S> this method provides accurate redshift calibrations and will enable studies of circumgalactic matter around galaxies for which rest - frame optical observations are not available .    </S>",
