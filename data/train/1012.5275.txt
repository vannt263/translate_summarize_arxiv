    "is related to the tubular structures that characterize the nexus initial conditions . in fig.[fig : nexus.ic ] , an example of initial energy density distribution is shown .",

    "an interesting effect that has been experimentally studied is the dependence of the two - particle correlation function on the azimuthal angle of the trigger particle @xmath1 with respect to the event plane @xcite . in a mid - central window ,",

    "the symmetrical one - tube events are included : @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which turns the plots symmetrical with respect to the origin .    in the in - plane case , in which the azimuthal angle of the trigger goes from @xmath35 to @xmath36 ( and from @xmath37 to @xmath38 ) , the two - particle correlation shows a peak at 0 and at @xmath3 as a consequence of the excess of particles at @xmath30 .",

    "( for instance , a configuration with @xmath46 produces a valley at @xmath47 , in the azimuthal distribution ) .",
    "however , when the two - particle correlation is integrated over tube position in order to obtain the final correlation for in - plane ( or out - of - plane ) triggers , certainly those configurations close to the example we chose ( @xmath22 ) dominate , because they produce an excess of particles , in comparison with the averaged azimuthal distribution , at @xmath30 ( in - plane ) and @xmath39 ( out - of - plane ) .",
