    "entanglement is nowadays recognized as a fundamental resource for quantum information processing ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "it explicitly appeared long before the dawn of quantum information science and without any reference to discrete variables ( qubits ) @xcite .",
    "in fact , it first came to light in the context of continuous variables @xcite .",
    "thus , its characterization must necessarily include the latter as well .",
    "along this line , important milestones have appeared in terms of continuous variables and more specifically gaussian states ( see e.g.  @xcite and reference therein ) .",
    "although bipartite entanglement can be conveniently characterized ( e.g.  in terms of purity or von neumann entropy ) @xcite , the characterization of multipartite entanglement remains a challenging problem , together with the definition of a class of quantum states that exhibit high values of multipartite entanglement .",
    "recently , the notion of maximally multipartite entangled state ( mmes ) was introduced in the qubit framework @xcite .",
    "these states have a large ( in fact , maximum ) value of average bipartite entanglement over all balanced bipartitions of a system of qubits @xcite .",
    "they are solution of an optimization problem and minimize a suitably defined cost function , that can be viewed as a potential of multipartite entanglement .",
    "a mmes is called  perfect \" if its average entanglement saturates the maximum bipartite entanglement for all bipartitions .",
    "perfect mmess exist for @xmath2 and 6 qubits , they do not exist for @xmath3 , @xmath4 @xcite , while the case @xmath5 is still an open problem . in terms of potential applications in quantum information science ,",
    "mmess are the ideal resource for initializing a quantum internet @xcite and could be useful in several multiparty quantum information protocols ( like e.g.  controlled teleportation @xcite or quantum secret sharing @xcite ) .",
    "the concept of mmes was extended to the framework of continuous variable ( and gaussian ) systems in @xcite .",
    "there a gaussian mmes is a state with a maximal rank for any bipartition of the @xmath6 party system in the limit of infinite squeezing @xcite .",
    "notice that such a state allows perfect quantum teleportation among its @xmath6 parties . here , with the aim of characterizing gaussian mmess",
    ", we adopt a different viewpoint , by introducing a constraint on the maximal mean energy allowed per user ( which , eventually , will be let to go to infinity ) . hence , we look for states that present the maximal amount of bipartite entanglement compatible with the given constraint . we will show that , following this definition , perfect mmess exist in the continuous variable gaussian setting only for @xmath7 . for @xmath8",
    "a simple argument shows that perfect mmess do not exist , hence manifesting the phenomenon of _ entanglement frustration _",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "then , for @xmath9 we study the distribution of entanglement among the bipartitions . finally , we find examples of mmess and provide numerical evidence that bipartite entanglement can be optimally distributed for @xmath10 .",
    "a system composed of @xmath6 identical ( but distinguishable ) subsystems is described by a hilbert space @xmath11 , with @xmath12 and @xmath13 , which is the tensor product of the hilbert spaces of its elements @xmath14 .",
    "examples range from qubits , where @xmath15 , to continuous variables systems , where @xmath16 .",
    "we will denote a bipartition of system @xmath17 by the pair @xmath18 , where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , with @xmath22 , the cardinality of party @xmath23 ( of course , @xmath24 ) . at the level of hilbert spaces we get @xmath25 a crucial question in quantum information is about the amount of entanglement between party @xmath23 and party @xmath26 .",
    "when the total system is in a pure state @xmath27 , which is the only case we will consider henceforth , the answer is simple , and can be given , for example , in terms of the purity @xmath28 of the reduced density matrix of party @xmath23 , @xmath29 indeed , this quantity can be taken as a measure of the entanglement of the bipartition @xmath18 .",
    "its range is @xmath30 where @xmath31 with the stipulation that @xmath32 .",
    "the upper bound @xmath33 is attained by unentangled , factorized states @xmath34 . on the other hand , when @xmath35 , the lower bound , which depends only on the number of elements @xmath36 composing party @xmath23 , is attained by maximally bipartite entangled states ,",
    "whose reduced density matrix is a completely mixed state @xmath37    note , however , that for continuous variables , @xmath38 , the lower bound @xmath39 is not attained by any state .",
    "therefore , strictly speaking , in this situation there do not exist maximally bipartite entangled states , but only states that approximate them .",
    "this inconvenience can be overcome by introducing physical constraints related to the limited amount of resources that one has in real life .",
    "this reduces the set of possible states and induces one to reformulate the question in the form : what are the physical minimizers of ( [ eq : piadef ] ) , namely the states that minimize ( [ eq : piadef ] ) and belong to the set @xmath40 of physically constrained states ?",
    "in sensible situations , e.g.  when one considers states with bounded energy and bounded number of particles , the purity lower bound latexmath:[\\[\\pi_{\\mathrm{min}}^{n_a , \\mathcal{c } } = \\inf\\{\\pi_a ,    longer zero and is attained by a class of minimizers , namely the _ maximally bipartite entangled states_. if this is the case , we can also consider multipartite entanglement and ask whether there exist states in @xmath40 that are maximally entangled for every bipartition @xmath18 , and therefore satisfy the extremal property @xmath42 for every subsystem @xmath19 with @xmath43 . in analogy with the discrete variable situation , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 , we will call a state that satisfies ( [ eq : perfectmmesdef ] ) a _ perfect mmes _ ( subject to the constraint @xmath40 ) .    since the requirement ( [ eq : perfectmmesdef ] ) is very strong , the answer to the quest can be negative for @xmath46 ( when @xmath0 it is trivially satisfied ) and the set of perfect mmes can be empty .",
    "we remind that for a system of @xmath6 qubits , i.e.  when @xmath47 , perfect mmess exist for @xmath48 , do not exist for @xmath3 , @xmath4 @xcite , while the case @xmath5 is still open .",
    "this is a symptom of frustration @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that this frustration is a consequence of the conflicting requirements that entanglement be maximal for all possible bipartitions of the system .    in the best of all possible worlds one",
    "can still seek for the ( nonempty ) class of states that better approximate perfect mmess , that is states with minimal average purity .",
    "we therefore consider the _ potential of multipartite entanglement _ @xcite @xmath49}\\end{array}\\!\\!\\right)^{-1}\\sum_{|a|=[n/2]}\\pi_a\\ ] ] where the sum runs over all balanced bipartition , with @xmath50 $ ] , where @xmath51 $ ] denotes the integer part .",

    "[ basicdef ] , in order to obtain sensible results , we will impose impose a suitable energy constraint .",
    "here we do not allow more than @xmath80 mean excitations for each bosonic mode , i.e.@xmath81 this constraint introduces a cutoff in the hilbert space of each quantum oscillator .",
    "a particular example of gaussian state is the thermal state @xmath82 with @xmath80 thermal excitations per mode described by a gaussian wigner function with vanishing first moments and cm @xmath83 obviously , @xmath82 satisfies the constraint ( [ energy ] ) .",
    "we now show the following    [ min_thermal ] among all gaussian states , the thermal state is the unique state that minimizes purity under the constraint ( [ energy ] ) .",
    "the corresponding minimal purity is @xmath84    * proof : * we prove that the thermal state is the unique minimizer of the purity among the gaussian states satisfying the inequality @xmath85 which constrains the average mean energy per mode .",
    "this is indeed sufficient to prove the proposition since all the states satisfying ( [ energy ] ) also satisfy ( [ energy_relax ] ) .",
    "the inequality ( [ energy_relax ] ) can be written in terms of the vector of first moments and the trace of the cm as follows @xmath86    now we notice from eq .",

    "a three - mode gaussian mmes has all the three single - mode reduced systems in a thermal state .",

    "the non existence of perfect gaussian mmess for @xmath8 is easily seen by inspecting the @xmath6-mode cm .",
    "indeed , the generic submatrix of @xmath130 modes is of the form @xmath131 where @xmath108 is a @xmath132 matrix and @xmath133 . for @xmath8",
    ", the definition of perfect gaussian mmes implies that @xmath134 this condition must hold for all bipartitions @xmath18 and , therefore , all off - diagonal sub - matrices are zero . as a consequence ,",
    "the cm of the gaussian state is diagonal of the form @xmath135 .",
    "such a cm describes a thermal state with @xmath80 thermal excitation per mode , in contradiction with the requirement that the global state of the @xmath6 oscillators is pure .",
    "we have seen that perfect mmess only exist for @xmath136 . for @xmath114",
    "we now numerically search for @xmath6-mode pure states minimizing the cost function ( [ merit ] ) , under the energy constraint ( [ energy ] ) .",

    "a good distribution of entanglement should be rather insensitive to a change of bipartition .",
    "a fairly distributed multipartite entanglement should therefore be characterized by a distribution ( over balanced bipartition ) with a small standard deviation @xcite .",

    "we will call a mmes with @xmath151 a _ uniformly optimal mmes _ , because it has an optimal distribution of entanglement : entanglement ( and frustration ) is fairly distributed over all bipartitions that attain the minimal value of purity allowed by frustration . of course , a perfect mmes is uniformly optimal .",
    "figure [ dchi_n ] displays the peculiar behavior of the standard deviation of the purity : such standard deviation has a different behavior as a function of @xmath80 for different values of @xmath6 . for @xmath152 and @xmath153 ,",

    "nonetheless , interestingly enough , they have an optimal distribution of entanglement : @xmath151 ( for @xmath10 ) .",
    "by contrast , a non optimal entanglement distribution has been found for mmes with @xmath3 and @xmath154 .",

    "we have shown that perfect gaussian mmess ( that saturate the maximum mean energy ) only exist for @xmath0 and @xmath158 , while the phenomenon of entanglement frustration appears already for @xmath8 .",
    "curiously , we found clear numerical evidence that although perfect gaussian mmess do not exist for @xmath152 and @xmath153 , for these particular values of @xmath6 , bipartite entanglement can be optimally distributed , in the sense that the standard deviation of purity over balanced bipartitions ( [ variance ] ) can be made to vanish .",
    "we numerically found that , by contrast , such standard deviation _ can not _ be made to vanish ( and bipartite entanglement is therefore not optimally distributed ) for @xmath3 and @xmath154 .",
    "this peculiar situation is reminiscent of that encountered with qubit mmes , where perfect mmess exist for @xmath152 and @xmath153 ( qubits ) , but do not exist for @xmath3 and ( probably @xcite ) @xmath5 .",

    "additional research is needed in order to investigate the large @xmath6 behavior and clarify the underlying structure of entanglement frustration .",
    "we emphasize again that this frustration is a consequence of the conflicting requirements that entanglement be maximal for all possible bipartitions of the system .",
    "the same phenomenon is also worth studying under different constraints , like , for instance , the ( weaker ) energy constraint ( [ energy_relax ] ) .    from a more applicative perspective",
