    "hadrons containing a single bottom quark have received much attention recently . over the last decade , the bottom meson sector has been investigated in great detail at the @xmath4 factories ( belle and babar ) and using the tevatron at fermilab . with the recent d@xmath3 measurement of the @xmath2 baryon @xcite",
    ", we are rapidly approaching a complete picture of the ground - state bottom baryon sector as well . the start up of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) will dramatically increase our knowledge of @xmath4 physics ; both the dedicated @xmath4 physics experiment , lhcb , and the general purpose atlas and cms experiments expect to observe unprecedented numbers of @xmath5 pairs , many of which will hadronise to bottom mesons and baryons .    in the bottom meson sector , many important observations have been made in the last decade , dramatically refining our knowledge of flavour physics .",
    "the ckm mechanism of the standard model currently provides a good description of current flavour - changing measurements of @xmath6 and @xmath7 mesons , bringing us into the precision era of flavour physics @xcite .",
    "the various lhc experiments aim to investigate the decays of bottom baryons with enough precision to further test the standard model .",
    "in particular , the fact that bottom baryon polarisation can be measured may uncover new right - handed couplings .",
    "to search for physics beyond the standard model in these systems , it is necessary to have accurate predictions from the standard model .",
    "typically , this requires non - perturbative evaluations of matrix elements from lattice qcd and thus an understanding of bottom hadrons in lattice qcd .",
    "the simplest properties of the bottom hadrons are their masses .",
    "before more complicated bottom observables can be predicted with any rigour , it is necessary to have reliable lattice calculations of the masses and mass splittings .",
    "there are many lattice studies of the mass of the @xmath6 mesons in the literature but fewer of the bottom baryons @xcite and , only recently , the first unquenched bottom baryon calculations have appeared @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we use light up and down quark masses to study the spectrum of bottom baryons and mesons . for the bottom quark , we work in the static ( @xmath8 ) limit . since the bottom quark mass , @xmath9",
    ", many properties of the physical bottom hadrons are expected to be close to those of hadrons containing a single , infinitely massive ( static ) quark , with corrections suppressed by powers of @xmath10 .",
    "such corrections can be addressed systematically in heavy quark effective theory ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "our calculations use domain - wall fermions for the light and strange quarks and make use of the dynamical gauge configurations generated by the rbc and ukqcd collaborations using domain - wall quarks @xcite .",
    "we currently work at a single lattice spacing , @xmath11  fm @xcite and focus on a volume of spatial side , @xmath12  fm , for a range of quark masses corresponding to pion masses between 275 and 750  mev .",
    "this paper is organised in the following manner . in section [ sec : deta - latt - calc ] , we present the details of the lattice calculations we have carried out .",
    "we discuss the mass splittings we observe in section  [ sec : su3-mass - splittings ] before concluding in section  [ sec : conclusions - outlook ] .",
    "the lattice qcd calculations presented here are based on the ensembles of 2 + 1 flavour lattices generated by the rbc and ukqcd collaborations @xcite .",
    "these ensembles use the iwasaki gauge action @xcite with @xmath13 and a domain wall quark action using the length of the fifth dimension , @xmath14 .",
    "the parameters of the ensembles used this work are shown in table [ tab : ensemble ] and we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for further details .",
    ".parameters of the ensembles of rbc / ukqcd gauge configurations used in this calculation . for full details , see the original works , refs .  .",

    "in this paper , we have presented a study of the mass splittings between mesons and baryons containing one static quark using lattice calculations based on the domain - wall fermion rbc / ukqcd ensembles .",
    "we have used domain wall quarks with a range of masses , the lightest set corresponding to a pion mass of @xmath16275  mev and at a single lattice spacing , @xmath11  fm . in general , the splittings we extract agree well with experiment .",
    "those involving the @xmath2 tend to be smaller than found experimentally as also found recently in the lattice calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite , but the discrepancy is barely significant at our current level of precision once the quark mass extrapolations are accounted for .",
    "our chiral extrapolations are somewhat _ ad hoc _ at present as the axial couplings between @xmath4-hadrons and light pseudoscalar mesons that appear in hh@xmath17pt are relatively unknown , making extrapolations using the results of chiral perturbation theory problematic .",
    "ongoing calculations of these charges will allow us to control better the mass difference extrapolations .",
    "additionally , the effects of the slightly unphysical strange quark mass need to be accounted for .",
    "our calculations are performed in the static limit of the @xmath4 quark and so our extracted values for the splittings are subject to uncertainties @xmath18 when compared to the experimental bottom hadron spectrum . in the future ,",
    "we intend to revisit these calculations using either non - relativistic qcd or the fermilab heavy quark formalism .",
    "we also intend to extend our calculations to other lattice spacings and volumes as they become available .",
