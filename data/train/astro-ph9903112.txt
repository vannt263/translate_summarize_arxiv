    "the accurate measurement of the fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background down to scales of a few arcmins by the forthcoming satellite missions map and planck will require a thorough analysis of all the astrophysical sources of submm / mm anisotropies , and a careful separation of the various foreground components ( bouchet _ et al .",

    "_ 1998a , bouchet & gispert 1999 ) . among them , the foreground due to resolved / unresolved ir / submm galaxies that are present at all redshifts on the line of sight was poorly known , until observations and analyses in the last three years began unveiling the `` optically dark '' ( and infrared  bright ) side of galaxy evolution at cosmological distances . in parallel to this observational breakthrough , a strong theoretical effort has opened up the way to a modelling of these galaxies that was able to implement the basic astrophysical processes ruling ir / submm emission in a consistent way . as a consequence of this",
    ", it is now possible to have a more general view on the problems of foreground separation , and on the capabilities of cmb missions to put new constraints on the number and properties of these sources .    in the _ local _ universe , we know from iras observations that about 30 % of the bolometric luminosity of galaxies is radiated in the ir ( soifer & neugebauer 1991 ) .",
    "local galaxies can be classified in a luminosity sequence from spirals ( e.g the milky way  the brightest spirals in the ir have a bar ) , and mild starbursts ( e.g. m82 ) , to the `` luminous infrared galaxies '' ( say , with @xmath0 ) , and `` ultra  luminous infrared galaxies '' ( say , with @xmath1 ) that radiate more than 95 % of their bolometric luminosity in the ir / submm .",
    "the ir / submm emission of these sources is due to dust that absorbs uv and optical light , and thermally reradiates with a broad spectral energy distribution ranging from a few @xmath2 m to a few mm .",
    "most of the heating is due to young stellar populations but , in the faintest objects , the average radiation field due to old stellar populations can be the main contributor , and , in the brightest objects ( especially the ulirgs ) , the question of the fraction of the heating that is due to a possible active galactic nucleus is still difficult to assess .",
    "however , recent work based on iso observations shows that starbursting still dominates in 80 % of ulirgs , whereas the agns power only the brightest objects ( genzel _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 , lutz _",
    "1998 ) .",
    "now , ir / submm observations are beginning to unveil what actually happened at higher redshift .",
    "the detection of the `` cosmic infrared background '' ( hereafter cirb ) at a level twice as high as the `` cosmic optical background '' ( hereafter cob ) has shown that about 2/3 of the luminosity budget of galaxies is emitted in the ir / submm range ( puget _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) . in the same time",
    ", the first deep surveys at submm wavelengths have discovered the sources that are responsible for the cirb , with a number density much larger than the usual predictions based on our knowledge of the local universe ( smail _ et al .",
    "the optical follow  up of these sources is still in progress , but it appears that some ( most ? ) of them should be the moderate and high  redshift counterparts of the local lirgs and ulirgs discovered by the iras satellite and thoroughly studied by the iso satellite .    we shall hereafter focus on these dusty sources with thermal radiation , and we refer the reader to the paper by toffolatti and coworkers ( this volume ) , for the description of the foreground due to radiosources that emit free  free and synchrotron radiations at larger wavelengths .    a consistent approach to the early evolution of galaxies is particularly important for any attempt at predicting their submm properties .",
    "three basic problems have to be kept in mind , that explain why it is so difficult , starting from general ideas about galaxy evolution , to get a correct assessment of the number density of faint submm sources and of the level of submm fluctuations they generate .    first , it is difficult to extrapolate the ir / submm properties of galaxies from our knowledge of their optical properties .",
    "it is well known that there is no correlation between the optical and ir fluxes  see e.g. soifer _ et al . _",
    "( 1987 ) for an analysis of the statistical properties of the `` bright galaxy sample '' .",
    "interestingly , the galaxies with the highest luminosities also emit most of their bolometric luminosity in the ir .",
    "if young stars are the dominant source of heating , it turns out that the strongest starbursts mainly emit in the ir / submm .",
    "1 shows a sequence of spectral energy distributions for local galaxies with various ir luminosities , very much in the spirit of fig . 2 of sanders & mirabel ( 1996 ) .",
    "the sources have been modelled by devriendt _",
    "( 1999 , see section 5 ) under the assumption that starbursts are the dominant source of heating .",
    "now , it is known that local lirgs and ulirgs are interacting systems and mergers ( e.g. sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "it is consequently plausible that their number density should increase with redshift , when more fuel was available for star formation and more interactions could trigger it . as a matter of fact , the hubble deep field ( hdf , williams _",
    "1996 ) has unveiled a large number of irregular / peculiar objects undergoing gravitational interactions ( abraham _ et al . _ 1996 ) .",
    "such a large number of interacting systems is of course predicted by the paradigm of hierarchical clustering , but the quantitative modelling of the merging rates of _ galaxies _ , and of the influence of merging on star formation is highly uncertain .",
    "second , we might have kept so far the prejudice that high  redshift galaxies have little extinction , simply because their heavy ",
    "element abundances are low ( typically 1/100 to 1/10 of solar at @xmath3 ) .",
    "however , low abundances do not necessarily mean low extinction .",
    "for instance , if we assume that dust grains have a size distribution similar to the one of our galaxy ( @xmath4 with @xmath5 ) , and are homogeneously distributed in a region with radius @xmath6 , the optical depth varies as @xmath7 , whereas the total dust mass varies as @xmath8 . for a given dust mass and size distribution ,",
    "there is more extinction where grains are small , and close to the heating sources .",
    "this is probably the reason why thuan _",
    "( 1998 ) observed a significant dust emission in the extremely metal  poor galaxy sbs0335 - 052 . in this context , modelling chemical evolution and transfer is not an easy task .",
    "third , distant galaxies are readily observable at submm wavelengths .",
    "2 shows _ model _",
    "spectra of an ulirg as it would be observed if placed at different redshifts .",
    "there is a wavelength range , between @xmath9 @xmath2 m and @xmath10 mm , in which the distance effect is counterbalanced by the `` negative k ",
    "correction '' due to the rest ",
    "frame emission maximum at @xmath11 @xmath2 m . in this range ,",
    "the apparent flux of galaxies depends weakly on redshift to the point that , evolution aside , a galaxy might be easier to detect at @xmath12 than at @xmath13 .",
    "the observer ",
    "frame submm fluxes , faint galaxy counts , and diffuse background of unresolved galaxies are consequently very sensitive to the early stages of galaxy evolution .",
    "note that this particular wavelength range brackets the maximum of emission of the cmb . as a consequence ,",
    "any uncertainty in the modelling of galaxy evolution at high @xmath14 will strongly reflect on the results of the faint counts of resolved sources , and on the fluctuations of the foreground of unresolved sources .    in sections 2 and 3",
    ", we report respectively on the recent observation of the cirb , and the faint submm counts with the iso satellite and the _ scuba _ instrument on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( see the review by mann and coworkers in this volume ) . in section 4 , we briefly mention the efforts to correct the optical surveys for the effect of extinction , that give a lower limit of the number of submm sources from the number of sources detected at optical wavelengths . in section 5 , we resume various attempts developped so far to compute consistent optical / ir spectra , and to model ir / submm counts . in section 6 ,",
    "we summarize recent developments of the semi  analytic modelling of galaxy formation and evolution where the computation of dust extinction and emission is explicitly implemented . finally , in section 7 , we sketch an overview of the sensitivities of forthcoming instruments that should greatly improve our knowledge of ir / submm sources , and we emphasize the capability of the planck _ high frequency instrument _ to get an all  sky survey of bright , dusty sources at submm wavelengths .",
    "the epoch of galaxy formation can be observed by its imprint on the background radiation that is produced by the accumulation of the light of extragalactic sources along the line of sight .",
    "the direct search for the cob currently gives only upper limits .",
    "however , estimates of lower limits can be obtained by summing up the contributions of faint galaxies .",
    "the shallowing of the faint counts obtained in the hdf ( williams _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) suggests that these lower limits are close to convergence .    in the submm range , puget _",
    "( 1996 ) have discovered an isotropic component in the _ firas _ residuals between 200 @xmath2 m and 2 mm .",
    "this measure was confirmed by subsequent work in the cleanest regions of the sky ( guiderdoni _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) , and by an independent determination ( fixsen _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) , giving a mean value of the background @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the wavelength in units of 100 @xmath2 m . the analysis of the _ dirbe _ dark sky has also led to the detection of the isotropic background at 240 and 140 @xmath2 m , and to upper limits at shorter wavelengths down to 2 @xmath2 m ( schlegel _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 , hauser _ et al .",
    "recently , a measure at 3.5 @xmath2 m was proposed by dwek & arendt ( 1998 ) .",
    "the results of these analyses seem in good agreement , though the exact level of the background around 140 and 240 @xmath2 m is still a matter of debate .",
    "the controversy concerns the correction for the amount of galactic dust in the ionized gas uncorrelated with the hi gas . a new assessment of the issue by lagache _",
    "( 1999 ) leads to values of the cirb that are in good agreement with the fit of _ firas _ data by fixsen _",

    "( 1998 ) . figure 3 displays the various determinations .",
    "it appears very likely that this isotropic background is the long  sought cirb ( puget _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 , dwek _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) . as shown in fig . 3",
    ", its level is about 510 times the no  evolution prediction based on the local ir luminosity function determined by iras .",
    "there is about twice as much flux in the cirb than in the cob . if the dust that emits at ir / submm wavelengths is mainly heated by young stellar populations , the sum of the fluxes of the cirb and cob gives the level of the cosmic background associated with stellar nucleosynthesis ( partridge & peebles 1967 ) .",
    "the bolometric intensity ( in w m@xmath17 sr@xmath18 ) is  : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the physical emissivity due to young stars at cosmic time @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the effective redshift for stellar he and metal nucleosynthesis .",
    "an approximate census of the local density of heavy elements @xmath23 @xmath24 mpc@xmath25 , taking into account the metals in the hot gas of rich galaxy clusters ( mushotzky & loewenstein 1997 ) gives an expected bolometric intensity of the background @xmath26 nw m@xmath17 sr@xmath18 .",
    "this value is roughly consistent with the observations for @xmath27  2 .    of course",
    ", it is not clear yet whether star formation is responsible for the bulk of dust heating , or there is a significant contribution of agns . in order to address this issue",
    ", one has first to identify the sources that are responsible for the cirb .",
    "the question of the origin of dust heating in heavily ",
    "extinguished objects is a difficult one , because both starburst and agn rejuvenation can be fueled by gas inflows triggered by interaction , and ir / submm spectra can be very similar if extinction is large .",
    "however , according to genzel _ et al . _",
    "( 1998 ) , the starburst generally contributes to 5090 % of the heating in local ulirgs .",
    "about 80 % of the ulirgs in the larger local sample of lutz _ et al . _",
    "( 1998 ) are dominated by the starburst , but the trend decreases with increasing luminosity , and the brightest objects are agn  dominated .",
    "now , it is very likely that the high  redshift counterparts of the local lirgs and ulirgs are responsible for the cirb .",
    "however the redshift evolution of the fraction and power of agns that are harbored in these distant objects is still unknown .",
    "various submm surveys have been achieved or are in progress .",
    "the firback program is a deep survey of 4 deg@xmath28 at 175 @xmath2 m with the _ isophot _ instrument aboard iso .",
    "the analysis of about 1/4 of the southern fields ( that is , of 0.25 deg@xmath28 , see fig .",
    "4 ) unveils 24 sources ( with a @xmath29 flux limit @xmath30 mjy ) , corresponding to a surface density five times larger than the no  evolution predictions based on the local ir luminosity function ( puget _ et al .",
    "it is likely that we are actualy seeing the maximum emission bump at 50100 @xmath2 m redshifted at cosmological distances , rather than a local population of sources with a very cold dust component , which seems to be absent from the shallow _ isophot _ survey at 175 @xmath2 m ( stickel _ et al .",
