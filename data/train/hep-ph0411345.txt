    "we now summarize the phenomenological consequences of type i see - saw models with a natural mass hierarchy and their type ii extensions with a natural mass degeneracy , for the low energy neutrino parameters and high - energy mechanisms as leptogenesis and minimal lepton flavour violation ( lfv ) . in order to compare the predictions of such natural see - saw models ( based on sequential dominance ) with the experimental data obtained at low energy , the renormalization group ( rg ) running of the effective neutrino mass matrix",
    "has to be taken into account .      for type",
    "i models with sequential dominance , the running of the mixing angles is generically small @xcite since the mass scheme is strongly hierarchical . when the neutrino mass scale is lifted , e.g.  via a type ii upgrade , a careful treatment of the rg running of the neutrino parameters , including the energy ranges between and above the see - saw scale @xcite , is required .",
    "dependent on @xmath57 in the mssm , on the size of the neutrino yukawa couplings and on the neutrino mass scale , the rg effects can be sizable or cause only small corrections .      at present , the cp phases in the lepton sector are unconstrained by experiment . in type",
    "i see - saw models based on sequential dominance , there is no restriction on them from a theoretical point of view .",

    "since the cp phases are small , there can be no significant cancellations in @xmath64 .",

    "if the dominant right - handed neutrino is the lightest one then the rate for @xmath74 is well below observable values .",
    "therefore @xmath75 provides a good discriminator between the two cases of dominance . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that the rate for @xmath76 may determine the order of the sub - dominant neutrino yukawa couplings in the flavour basis .",
    "in sequential dominance we have seen that one of the right - handed neutrinos effectively decouples from the see - saw mechanism .",
    "if the decoupled right - handed neutrino is also the heaviest then it would be expected to play no part in phenomenology . in this case",
    "sequential dominance reduces to effectively two right - handed neutrino models @xcite .",
    "recently there have been several studies based on the `` minimal see - saw '' involving two right - handed neutrinos @xcite , and it is worth bearing in mind that such models could naturally arise as the limiting case of sequential dominance .",
    "sequential dominance has recently also been applied to sneutrino inflation @xcite , @xcite .",
    "requiring a low reheat temperature after inflation , in order to solve the gravitino problem , forces the sneutrino inflaton to couple very weakly to ordinary matter and its superpartner almost to decouple from the see - saw mechanism .",

    "the renormalisation group corrections need to be taken into account , although for a natural hierarchy such corrections are only a few per cent @xcite .    as an example of a model based on a non - abelian family symmetry , we briefly review the model proposed in @xcite .",
    "the model uses the largest family symmetry @xmath79 consistent with @xmath80 guts . an important further motivation for @xmath79",
    "family symmetry is , in the framework of sequential dominance , to relate the second and third entries of the yukawa matrix , as required to obtain an almost maximal 23 mixing in the atmospheric neutrino sector @xcite .",
    "the theoretical requirements that the neutrino yukawa matrix resembles the quark yukawa matrices , and therefore has a large 33 element with no large off - diagonal elements and a texture zero in the 11 position leads uniquely to the dominant right - handed neutrino being the first ( lightest ) one . assuming this then the atmospheric neutrino mixing angle is given by @xmath82 .",
    "the sequential dominance conditions which were assumed earlier will here be derived from the symmetries of the model .",
    "thus this model provides an example of the application of sequential dominance to realistic models of flavour , and shows how the conditions of sequential dominance which were simply assumed earlier can motivate models based on guts and family symmetry which are capable of explaining these conditions . in other words , the conditions for sequential dominance can provide clues to the nature of the underlying flavour theory .",
    "the starting point of the model is the observation that an excellent fit to all quark data is given by the approximately symmetric form of quark yukawa matrices @xcite @xmath83where the expansion parameters @xmath84 and @xmath85 are given by @xmath86    this motivates a particular model in which the three families are unified as triplets under an @xmath79 family symmetry , and @xmath87 under an @xmath80 gut @xcite , @xmath88 where the @xmath80 is broken via the pati - salam group resulting in : @xmath89 further symmetries @xmath90 are assumed to ensure that the vacuum alignment leads to a universal form of dirac mass matrices for the neutrinos , charged leptons and quarks @xcite . to build a viable model",

    "the charged lepton mass matrix is of the georgi - jarslkog @xcite form which , after including radiative corrections , gives an excellent description of the charged lepton masses . in the neutrino sector",

    "analytic estimates of neutrino masses and mixing angles for sequential dominance were derived in section 3 @xcite . with the dominant right - handed neutrino of mass @xmath16 being the lightest one , the matrices in eq.[seq1 ]",
    "should be re - ordered as follows before comparing to the neutrino matrices in eqs.[ynu ] and [ mrra ] : @xmath123 the above re - ordering of course leaves the results in eqs.[masses ] and [ angles ] unchanged .",
    "the analytic estimates for the neutrino masses are obtained by comparing the matrices in eqs.[seq2 ] to those in eqs.[ynu ] and [ mrra ] then using the results in eqs.[masses ] and [ angles ] : @xmath124and neutrino mixing angles : @xmath125the physical lepton mixing angle @xmath26 receives a large contribution from the neutrino sector @xmath126 at the high energy scale , for this choice of parameters , compared to the current chooz limit @xmath127 .",
    "however the physical mixing angles will receive charged lepton contributions @xcite and all the parameters are subject to radiative corrections in running from the high energy scale to low energies , although in sequential dominance models these corrections are only a few per cent @xcite . thus the model predicts that @xmath26 is close to the current chooz limit , and could be observed by the next generation of long baseline experiments such as minos or opera .",
    "neutrino mass allows the possibility that the baryon asymmetry of the universe is generated by out - of - equilibrium decay of lepton - number violating majorana right - handed ( s)neutrinos , whose decays result in a net lepton number which is subsequently converted to a net baryon number by sphaleron transitions .",
    "this mechanism is known as leptogenesis @xcite . in models which give a natural neutrino mass hierarchy , if the dominant right - handed neutrino is the lightest one then the washout parameter @xmath128 , which is rather too large compared to the optimal value of around @xmath129 ev , while if the dominant right - handed neutrino is either the intermediate one or the heaviest one then one finds @xmath130 or arbitrary @xmath131 , which can be closer to the desired value @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that if the dominant right - handed neutrino is the lightest one , and there is a 11 texture zero , as is the case in the @xmath0 model discussed in the last section , then there is a link between the cp violation required for leptogenesis , @xmath132 , and the phase @xmath58 measurable in accurate neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite .",

    "the diagrams are shown in figure [ fig : leptogenesis_triplet_susy ] .",
    "the result we obtained for the supersymmetric case is new and we corrected the previous result in the scenario based on the standard model . @xcite .",
    "we subsequently derived a general upper bound on the decay asymmetry and found that it increases with the neutrino mass scale :    [ eq : boundseffdecayass]@xmath133    it leads to a lower bound on the mass of the lightest right - handed neutrino , which is significantly below the type i bound for partially degenerate neutrinos .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that these results are in sharp contrast to the type i see - saw mechanism where an upper bound on the neutrino mass scale is predicted .",
    "here we find no upper limit on the neutrino mass scale which may be increased arbitrarily .",
    "indeed we find that the lower bound on the mass of the lightest right - handed neutrino decreases as the physical neutrino mass scale increases .",
    "this allows a lower reheat temperature , making thermal leptogenesis more consistent with the gravitino constraints in supersymmetric models .",
    "in this talk we have discussed how a natural neutrino mass hierarchy can follow from the type i see - saw mechanism , and a natural neutrino mass degeneracy from the type ii see - saw mechanism , where the bi - large mixing angles can arise from either the neutrino or charged lepton sector .",
    "the key to achieving naturalness is the idea of sequential dominance of right - handed neutrinos , namely that in the see - saw mechanism one of the right - handed neutrinos dominates and couples with approximately equal strength to the @xmath135 and @xmath136 families , leading to an approximately maximal atmospheric mixing angle .",
    "a second right - handed neutrino then plays the leading sub - dominant role , and couples with approximately equal strength to all three families , leading to a large solar mixing angle .",

    "we have summarised the phenomenological implications of such a natural approach to neutrino model building , and have discussed some of the model building applications , focussing on the @xmath0 model .",
    "we then turned to leptogenesis and mentioned the possible link between the leptogenesis phase and the phase measurable in neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "we then pointed out that in natural type ii models the leptogenesis asymmetry parameter becomes proportional to the neutrino mass scale , in sharp contrast to the type i case , which leads to an upper bound on the neutrino mass scale , allowing lighter right - handed neutrinos and hence making leptogenesis more consistent with the gravitino constraints in supersymmetric models .        for",

  "abstract_text": [
    "<S> in this talk we show how a natural neutrino mass hierarchy can follow from the type i see - saw mechanism , and a natural neutrino mass degeneracy from the type ii see - saw mechanism , where the bi - large mixing angles can arise from either the neutrino or charged lepton sector . </S>",
    "<S> we summarize the phenomenological implications of such natural models , and discuss the model building applications of the approach , focussing on the @xmath0 model . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that in such type ii models the leptogenesis asymmetry parameter becomes proportional to the neutrino mass scale , in sharp contrast to the type i case , which leads to an upper bound on the neutrino mass scale , allowing lighter right - handed neutrinos and hence making leptogenesis more consistent with the gravitino constraints in supersymmetric models .    </S>",
