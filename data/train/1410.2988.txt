    "data mining techniques are useful in order to discover efficiently the hidden interesting and useful information from large databases , where the implication of interesting and useful information depends on the problem formulation and the application domain .",
    "an important data mining task that has received considerable research attention in recent years is the discovery of association rules from the transactional databases @xcite .",
    "the traditional association rules mining ( arm ) techniques depend on support confidence framework in which all items are given same importance by considering the presence of an item within a transaction , but not the profit of item in that transaction .",
    "the goal of such techniques is to extract all the frequent itemsets , then generate all the valid association rules @xmath0 from frequent itemset @xmath1 whose confidence has at least the user defined confidence threshold . in other words , given a subset of the items in an itemset , we need to predict the probability of the purchase of the remaining items in a transactional database .",
    "nevertheless , this support - confidence framework does not provide the semantic measure of the rule but only it provides the statistical measure as the relative importance of items is not considered .",
    "however , such measure is not an adequate measure to the decision maker as the itemset can not be measured in terms of stock , cost or profit , called utility .    in order to address the above shortcoming of support confidence framework , several researchers have focused on weighted association rule @xcite . in such framework , the weights of items ( the importance of items to the user ) are considered and it also varies differently in application domains . however",
    ", this framework has two pitfalls .",
    "firstly , these schemes still consider the support of an itemset to measure their importance and secondly , these models do not employ the quantities or prices of items purchased .",
    "several researchers have also proposed itemset share measure , which is the fraction of some numerical value in order to overcome these shortcomings @xcite . @xcite",
    "proposed a share - confidence model to discover association rule among numerical attributes which are associated with items in a transaction .",
    "carter et al.s share - confidence model deals with the amount - share that is a fraction of total weight but not the utility value , such as the net profit , total cost @xcite . as a result",
    ", this model does not accomplish to conventional utility mining @xcite in which the requirements of decision makers are used to extract the itemsets with high utility , the utility of itemset is no less than the user specified minimum utility threshold , which are composed of weights and purchased quantities .",
    "the weight represents the importance of distinct items known as _ external utility _ , and the purchased quantity in each transaction is known as _ internal utility _ of the items .",
    "the product of external utility with sum total of internal utility of an item is called _ utility _ of the item . as utility does not satisfy _ downward closure property _",
    "@xcite , most of the methods proposed in the literature are applied to find the candidate high utility itemsets first and then to identify high utility itemsets by an additional database scan .",
    "some researchers proposed methods to find high utility itemsets without candidate generations @xcite .",
    "the traditional support - confidence model is limited by the number of rules generated that are often not interesting to the user especially when the confidence threshold is very low and some interesting rules are missed when the confidence threshold is very high . in the extracted rule set , most of the rules share the same semantic measure or statistical measure with other rules , and they are called the redundant rules .",
    "henceforth , it limits the usefulness of the rule set for the user to validate and take decisions . to discover the non - redundant association rules in support - confidence framework ,",
    "several approaches have been proposed in the literature @xcite . in general , the frequent closed itemsets @xcite and frequent generators @xcite are used to discover non - redundant association rules .",
    "however , these methods are developed for support - confidence framework .",
    "therefore , in this paper we raise an important question as follows .",
    "how can we compress the association rules in high utility itemset mining ?",
    "we aim to answer this question by integrating the concept of frequent closed itemsets and frequent generator to high utility itemset .",
    "to represent high utility itemset compactly , @xcite introduced the concept of utility frequent closed patterns , where the notion of high utility itemset is different from that of the conventional utility mining .",
    "later , @xcite proposed the maximal high utility itemset , and @xcite proposed the high utility closed itemset . in these works , there is no algorithm was provided to generate rules .",
    "so , if we apply traditional association rule mining , the rules generated from these high utility itemsets would contain redundancy , and also of huge size as they compactly represent high utility itemsets but not the rules .    in order to apply the condensed representation of association rules in support - confidence framework to high utility itemset mining",
    ", we first integrate the concept of minimal generators of support - confidence framework to the high utility mining . to extract high utility closed itemsets with their generators simultaneously an algorithm named _ huci - miner _",
    "( high utility closed itemset - miner ) algorithm has been proposed . from the generated high utility",
    "closed itemsets with their generators , various condensed representations of association rules from the literature can be extracted from high utility itemsets .",
    "experiments are carried out to show the compactness of the extracted high utility itemsets .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows . in section 2 , we briefly review the existing works proposed in the literature . in section 3 , we provide some basic preliminaries .",
    "section 4 introduces our proposed huci - miner algorithm .",
    "we also discuss the procedure for deriving high utility closed itemsets and generators . in section 5 , we simulate the proposed algorithms method in real and synthetic datasets .",
    "finally , the paper ends with the concluding remarks in section 6 .",
    "in this section , we review the existing methods for high utility itemset mining and generation of non - redundant association rules in support - confidence framework . in the support - confidence framework , the non - redundant association rules are generated from the frequent closed itemsets and their generators .",
    "we also review existing works on generation of frequent closed itemsets together with their generators as it is essential for generation of non - redundant association rules .",
    "the traditional association rule mining methods @xcite are based on support - confidence framework , where all items are considered with the same level of importance .",
    "the methods proposed in @xcite to extract association rule follow this classical statistical measurement producing the same result on a given minimum support and minimum confidence",
    ". the weighted association rule mining ( warm ) generalizes the traditional framework by giving importance to items , where importance is given as weights .",
    "@xcite introduced the concept of weighted support of itemsets and weighted association rules on the basis of costs assigned to both items and transactions .",
    "later , considering only the item weights into account , @xcite proposed the weighted support of association rules .",
    "however , the weighted support of the association rules does not satisfy the downward closure property , which results in the performance degradation . in order to overcome such problem , by considering transaction weight ,",
    "@xcite provided the concept of weighted downward closure property . considering both support and weight of itemsets",
    ", @xcite then presented a new strategy , called the weighted interesting pattern mining ( wip ) .",
    "@xcite further proposed a warm method that automates the process of weight assignment to the items by formulating a linear model .    in warm framework ,",
    "note that the quantities of items in transactions are not considered .",
    "considering items quantities in transactions and their individual importance , high utility itemset mining ( huim ) received a considerable research attention @xcite .",
    "yao et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a mathematical model of utility mining by generalizing the share - confidence model @xcite .",
    "as utility mining does not fulfill the _ downward closure property _ , @xcite proposed the two - phase algorithm that uses the _ transaction - weighted downward closure property _ to prune the candidate high utility itemsets in the first phase and then all the complete sets of high utility itemsets are obtained in the second phase . to reduce the number of candidate itemsets in the first phase , @xcite also proposed an isolated items discarding strategy ( iids ) to the level - wise utility mining method .",
    "@xcite proposed a fp - growth based algorithm @xcite that uses a tree structure , named ihup - tree , and efficiently generates the candidate high utility itemsets for incremental and the interactive mining . to further reduce the number of itemsets in the first phase , tseng et al .",
    "@xcite proposed the tree - based methods , named the up - growth and up - growth@xmath2 , which use several strategies to decrease the estimated utility value of an itemset , and as a result , they enhance the performance . to avoid the level wise candidate generation and test strategy",
    ", @xcite proposed a concurrent algorithm , called the chui - mine , for mining huis from transaction databases using their proposed data structure chui - tree to maintain the information of huis .",
    "their proposed algorithm generates the potential high utility itemsets using two concurrent processes : the first process is used for construction and dynamic pruning the tree , and then placing the conditional trees into a buffer , and the second one for reading the conditional pattern list from the buffer and mining huis . to speed up the execution and reduce the memory requirement in the mining process , @xcite proposed an efficient utility mining approach that adopts a projection - based indexing mechanism that directly generates the required itemsets from the transactions database .",
    "@xcite proposed a novel tree - based candidate pruning technique , called the high utility candidates prune ( huc - prune ) , for avoiding more database scans and the level - wise candidate generation .    to avoid the computational cost of candidate generation and utility computation",
    ", @xcite then proposed a data structure , named the utility - list , to store both the utility information about an itemset and the heuristic information for pruning the search space . using the constructed utility - lists from a mined database",
    ", they developed an efficient algorithm , called the hui - miner , which mines high utility itemsets without candidate generation in a depth - first search manner .",
    "their algorithm works in a single phase by directly identifying high utility itemsets in an efficient way and it is also scalable . to reduce the cost of join operation in the calculation of the utility - list of an itemset in hui - miner , @xcite improved the hui - miner incorporating with the items co - occurrences strategy ( named as fhm ) that is about six times faster the hui - miner .      to generate both frequent closed itemsets",
    "( fci ) and generators , @xcite proposed the close algorithm that is based on level - wise searching approach with the help of apriori property .",
    "@xcite proposed the zart algorithm that generates fcis with their generators in a level - wise manner .",
    "they further proposed the eclat - z algorithm @xcite that mines frequent itemsets in a depth - first way and the fcis with their generators are identifies in level - wise manner .",
    "an effective method , named as touch @xcite , was developed by combining the fci method charm @xcite and the frequent generator ( fg ) mining algorithm , talky - g @xcite .",
    "the fcis are mined using charm and fgs are mined using talky - g and , then touch associates the generators to their closed itemsets using a suitable hash function .",
    "@xcite introduced the closer concept to high utility itemsets .",
    "they called the extracted itemsets as closed@xmath2 high utility itemsets . on incorporating closure based on support of itemsets",
    ", they proved , first mining the set of high utility itemsets and then applying closed constraint produces the same result while mining all the closed itemsets first and then applying the utility constraint .",
    "they proposed an effective method named as chud ( closed@xmath2 high utility itemset discovery ) for mining closed+ high utility itemsets .",
    "further , they proposed a method called the dahu ( derive all high utility itemsets ) , to recover all high utility itemsets from the set of closed@xmath2 high utility itemsets without further accessing the database .",
    "in addition , they proposed apriorihc and apriorihc - d algorithms @xcite and mentioned that chud performs better than apriorihc and apriorihc - d . however , no suitable method for high utility closed itemset with their generator is proposed for high utility itemset mining .    to reduce the number of association rules extracted in support confidence - framework , several methods have been developed in the literature @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed the representative association rules ( rr ) with the help of a cover operator that represents a set of association rules .",
    "@xcite proposed a method to reduce the number of association rules and the extracted rules , called the general rules , which have shortest antecedent and shortest consequent giving an equivalence class of rules of same support and confidence .",
    "@xcite defined the min - max rules having minimal antecedent and maximal consequent .",
    "their proposed method eliminates the non - redundant rules as min - max exact and min - max approximate rules from the frequent closed itemsets and their generators .",
    "furthermore , to reduce more rules , @xcite proposed the concept of @xmath3-tolerance , which is a relaxation on the closure defined on the support of frequent itemset .",
    "@xcite proposed an informative basis to reduce the number of association rules , which is further efficiently compressed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite filtered the min - max rules by defining redundancy and provided the reliable exact basis and reliable approximate basis of the same inference capacity .",
    "@xcite further obtained a small and crisp set of association rules by the help of confidence boost of a rule , which eliminates the rules with similar confidence .",
    "in this section , we first discuss some basic preliminaries .    let @xmath4 be a finite set of items , where each item @xmath5 , have an external utility @xmath6 in the utility table .",
    "a subset @xmath7 is called an itemset , if @xmath8 contains @xmath9 distinct items @xmath10 , where @xmath11 , called a @xmath9-itemset .",
    "let @xmath12 be the task relevant database composed of utility table and the transaction table @xmath13 , containing a set of @xmath14 transactions , where each transaction @xmath15 , in the database be associated with a unique identifier , say @xmath16 .",
    "in every transaction @xmath17 each item @xmath5 has a non - negative quantity @xmath18 , which represents the purchased quantity known as internal utility of the item @xmath19 in the transaction @xmath20 .",
    "each itemset @xmath8 has a statistical measure called the support of @xmath8 , which is defined by the ratio of the number of transactions containing @xmath8 to the total number of transactions @xmath21 , and denoted by @xmath22 . in other words , @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath24 be the set of all the itemsets in @xmath12 having positive support and @xmath25 an association rule is an implication of the form @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "the itemsets @xmath8 and @xmath30 are called antecedent and consequent of the rule @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "association rules are associated with two statistical measures , which are support and confidence .",

    "thus , the utility of item @xmath52 in @xmath54 is @xmath55 .",
