    "rx j1914 + 24 was discovered during the course of the _ rosat _ all - sky survey and was found to show a modulation in x - rays on a period of 9.5 min ( motch et al 1996 ) . in further observations ,",
    "cropper et al ( 1998 ) detected only the 9.5 min period which they suggested was the binary orbital period .",
    "this implied a very small binary dimension .",
    "this together with the x - ray light curve , which was consistent with zero for half the 9.5 min period , led them to propose that the system is a polar ( those magnetic cataclysmic variables  mcvs  in which the accreting white dwarf has a magnetic field strong enough to synchronise its spin period with the binary orbital period ) .",
    "this would imply that the 9.5 min period seen in x - rays was both the spin period of the accreting white dwarf and also the binary orbital period .",
    "for an orbital period this short the secondary star could not be a main sequence star as in the case of ordinary mcvs .",
    "it could , however , be a he white dwarf .",
    "if confirmed , rx  j1914 + 24 would be the first binary system in which both components are white dwarfs and magnetically synchronised  a double degenerate polar .",
    "furthermore , its orbital period would be the shortest of any known stellar binary system .",
    "observations by ramsay et al .",
    "( 2000 ) gave supporting evidence for the double degenerate polar interpretation .",
    "these include : discovery of the optical counterpart ( in the @xmath0 band ) in which only one period was seen ( the 9.5 min period seen in x - rays ) ; no periods other than the 9.5 min period in further x - ray data ; an x - ray spectrum which is very soft and typical of polars ; large variations in its long - term x - ray light curve which are typical of polars , and infrared colours which are not consistent with that of a main - sequence star .",
    "ramsay et al.(2000 ) also found that the peak intensity in the x - ray and @xmath0 band light curves were approximately anti - phased .",
    "they interpreted the x - ray flux as originating from the accretion region on the white dwarf , while the @xmath0-band flux originated from the irradiated face of the mass donating white dwarf .",
    "this was consistent with the observation that the @xmath0-band flux was not polarised .",
    "in this paper we present further observations of rx  j1914 + 24 .",
    "we discuss these results in relation to the double degenerate polar model of cropper et al ( 1998 ) and ramsay et al ( 2000 ) .",
    "we also consider several alternative models for rx  j1914 + 24 .",
    "rx  j1914 + 24 was observed on 1999 june 6 in the @xmath1 band using the 8-m subaru telescope on hawaii and the cooled infrared spectrograph and camera ( cisco ) in its imaging mode .",
    "each exposure was 5  sec in duration , and after every 12 exposures an offset was applied to the telescope so that a flat field could be obtained .",
    "the observation lasted @xmath21 hour .",
    "conditions were good and the seeing was @xmath20.4 arc sec .",
    "an image using all the frames ( each frame was shifted in position so the stellar images were coincident ) is shown in figure [ finding ] .    to make an accurate determination of the position of the optical counterpart of rx  j1914 + 24 , we matched the positions of stars in the subaru image with those in the digitised sky survey .",
    "the accurate positions of these stars were then taken from the usno a1.0 catalogue .",
    "we then determined the position of rx  j1914 + 24 using the astrometry package astrom ( wallace 1998 ) : @xmath3 = 19@xmath4  14@xmath5  26.1@xmath6 , @xmath7 = + 24@xmath8  56@xmath9  43.6@xmath10 .",

    "the conditions were photometric on the first two nights .",
    "the seeing was typically 1@xmath10 . to obtain circular polarimetry data",
    "a 1/4-waveplate was inserted into the optical path : this split the light into both polarised beams on the loral 2k@xmath122k ccd so that 2 images of each star were recorded .",

    "we would not regard this dip as significant if observed in only one band , but its presence in 3 bands ( taken at different epochs ) suggests that it is indeed significant .",
    "the presence of a 1/4 waveplate and calcite block in the optical path allowed us to search for circular polarisation in rx  j1914 + 24 .",

    "we can make a very crude estimate of the temperature difference between the irradiated and non - irradiated hemispheres of the secondary star , if we assume they have equal areas and the emission can be approximated by a blackbody . in reality neither assumption is likely to be an accurate approximation , as the emission is probably characterised by a blackbody component together with another component which is due to irradiation .",
    "other effects , such as limb darkening will also complicate matters . assuming a mean temperature for the secondary of t=20000k we find that the observed amplitude variations require a temperature difference of @xmath210002000k between the irradiated and non - irradiated parts of the secondary .",

    ", we find that the width of the dip is @xmath420.03 cycles .",
    "the phasing of the optical / infrared light curve with respect to the x - ray curve suggests that it could be due to a stream which partially obscures the irradiated surface of the secondary .",
    "since the dip is so narrow , the stream should have a small diameter .",
    "suppose rx j1914 + 24 consists of a magnetic white dwarf accreting material from its companion . for a dipole magnetic field ,",
    "one can define a magnetospheric radius , @xmath43 , at which point the magnetic pressure balances the ram pressure of the accretion flow .",

    "the azimuthal angular span of the accretion stream is approximately constant from the @xmath51 point towards the primary and hence the width of the dip seen in the optical can be estimated if we can determine the radius of the stream at the @xmath51 point .",
    "the radius of the stream at the @xmath51 point , @xmath52 , is roughly given by @xmath53 where @xmath29 is the scale height of the unperturbed atmosphere , given by @xmath54 and @xmath55 is the surface temperature of the secondary star , @xmath56 is the mean molecular mass , @xmath57 is the mass of the secondary ( pringle 1985 ) . in our double degenerate polar interpretation , we have @xmath57=0.08 , giving @xmath58  cm from the nauenberg ( 1972 ) mass - radius relationship for white dwarfs . for a helium atmosphere , @xmath56=4 and for @xmath59",

    "cropper et al .  ( 1998 ) suggested that rx  j1914 + 24 is a double degenerate polar to explain the lack of a second period in the _ rosat _ data and the shape of the x - ray light curve .",
    "the more extensive study of ramsay et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , added weight to this argument : the x - ray spectrum is typical of polars ; a main sequence secondary star was found to be inconsistent with the infrared colours ; and a more detailed search of the x - ray and optical data continued to reveal only a single period .    at this point",
    "it maybe useful to briefly summarise the arguments that support the presence of mass transfer in rx  j1914 + 24 .",
    "the fact that we observe a modulation in x - rays and the optical is not by itself indicative of mass transfer : for instance , a modulation is seen in the non - interacting white dwarf re  j0317@xmath62853 due to its rotation ( barstow et al .",
    "1995 ) . on the other hand , since the optical and x - ray light curves are out of phase ( figure [ fold ] ) it is much more likely that it is indeed an interacting binary .",
    "further , ramsay et al .  (",
    "2000 ) found a large variation in the long - term x - ray light curve which can be explained in terms of mass - transfer variations .",
    "these features support the double degenerate polar model .",
    "however , in this model we would also expect to detect optical polarisation and emission lines  which we do not detect .",
    "we now go on to address these issues .",
    "@xmath0-band polarimetry by ramsay et al .",
    "( 2000 ) failed to detect significant circular polarisation in the system .",
    "the anti - phasing of the @xmath0-band and x - ray light curves indicates that the optical flux is unlikely to originate from cyclotron emission .",
    "ramsay et al .  ( 2000 ) concluded that the magnetic field of the primary must be sufficiently high for the cyclotron emission to peak in the uv , or sufficiently low for it to be at infrared wavelengths .",
    "alternatively , they suggested that no shock formed owing to the small dimensions of the system .",
    "our @xmath14 band polarimetric and spectropolarimetric observations presented in this paper extend the non - detection of circular polarisation to shorter wavelengths , so that the high - field option above can be considered less tenable .",
    "unfortunately no infrared circular polarimetry is available to test the low field option .",
    "a second difficulty with the double degenerate polar model is that we find that _ no _ detectable emission lines .",
    "a general ( indeed almost defining ) feature of accreting binary stars is the presence of emission lines . in the case of am cvn systems ( non - magnetic interacting double - degenerate binary systems ) the donor is a low - mass helium white dwarf . in these systems ,",
    "no hydrogen lines are visible , but strong helium lines are present ( eg marsh , horne & rosen 1991 ) .    if mass transfer does occur , the lack of emission lines may be due to continuum emission from the heated face of the secondary which far exceeds the flux from any line emission from the accretion stream . assuming the temperatures of the heated secondary and the accretion stream are approximately similar , then the flux ratio from the secondary and the stream is simply proportional to the relative emitting areas . for the secondary",
    ", the area is @xmath63 @xmath64 . crudely , the projected area of the stream is @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the radius of the stream and @xmath67 the orbital separation . in  [ dip ]",
    "we estimate the radius of the stream as @xmath68 and @xmath69 cm ( ramsay et al 2000 ) , giving an area of @xmath70 @xmath64 .",
    "the flux ratio is therefore @xmath2100 . for a hot accretion stream ,",
    "say @xmath7130000 k , line emission would be suppressed and therefore the flux ratio of 100 must be regarded as a lower limit . although the double degenerate polar model predicts weak optical emission lines to be present , we will require a spectrum of much higher signal to noise than the spectra obtained in  2 to test this .",
    "despite the success of the double - degenerate polar model in explaining many of the characteristics of the system , the absence of both detectable circular polarisation and line emission requires some explanation .",
    "the arguments discussed earlier indicate that it is possible to explain the absence of these features , but only by adopting particular values for the magnetic field and that the emission lines are so weak that we did not detect them in our relatively low signal to noise spectra .",
    "we have therefore explored whether there may be alternative models for rx j1914 + 24 which would explain its characteristics more naturally .",
    "we consider below three alternatives : a double - degenerate algol model , a neutron star - white dwarf pair and an electrically driven model .      in normal algol systems ,",
    "the accretor is an early main sequence star , the donor either a late type giant or sub - giant star .",
    "for relatively short period systems ( less than @xmath26 days ) , the radius of the primary , @xmath72 , is large enough compared to the minimum distance between the stream and the center of the primary ( @xmath73 ) , that the accretion stream will impact directly onto the primary without forming an accretion disc .",
    "here we consider the case when both the primary and secondary are white dwarfs with negligible magnetic fields .",
    "we show in figure [ algol ] , for a range of combinations of @xmath46 , @xmath73 and @xmath72 .",
    "we also show for interest , the radius from the primary at which a disc starts to form  the circularisation radius @xmath74 .",
    "figure [ algol ] shows that for @xmath750.5the stream will impact directly onto the primary .",
    "this model has the advantage that it would naturally account for the lack of optical polarisation .",
    "in addition , if the accretion stream flow impacts with the primary over a range of azimuth , it is likely that the brightness of the accretion site would not be uniform .",
    "this would result in a non - symmetric x - ray light curve : this is consistent with the x - ray light curves shown in figure [ fold ] .",
    "however , as with the double degenerate polar model , emission lines ( possibly weak ) would be expected to be observed in optical spectra .",
    "after we submitted this paper , we became aware of a paper by marsh & steeghs ( 2002 ) who also propose this double - degenerate algol model for rx j1914 + 24 .",

    "however , if the neutron star is accreting at a low rate , say from material located in the binary system which maybe the remnants of a previous evolutionary phase , then the predicted luminosity could equal the observed luminosity .    we conclude that a neutron star - white dwarf model for rx j1914 + 24 is only viable if the neutron star is accreting material which has been left over from a previous phase of binary evolution .",
    "this scenario is attractive in the sense that we would not expect to observe significant levels of polarisation in the optical band .",
    "further , we would not necessarily expect to observe optical line emission if the neutron star was accreting spherically .",
    "in addition , if accretion was occurring onto one of the magnetic poles of the neutron star the x - ray light curve could match the observed x - ray profile for a wide range of geometries .",
    "as in the double degenerate polar interpretation the hot polar cap could irradiate the secondary white dwarf and cause a phase shift in the x - ray / optical data .      in our double degenerate polar model the less massive degenerate star ,",
    "the secondary , must fill its roche - lobe in order to facilitate the mass - transfer process .",
    "suppose that the companion is now slightly denser and unable to fill its roche lobe .",
    "the companion is still tidally locked into synchronous rotation with the orbit , while the magnetic primary may not be in perfect synchronism .",
    "the secondary will then traverse the magnetic field of the primary . because white dwarfs are highly conductive , a large e.m.f .",
    "will be induced across the secondary .",
    "if the space between the two white dwarfs is filled with plasma , current loops can be set up ( closed circuits ) , and the system acts like a unipolar inductor .",
    "dissipation occurs mainly in the atmospheres of the white dwarfs , where the resistance is highest .",
    "we now consider an alternative to our accretion driven scenarios .",
    "one example of a cosmic unipolar inductor is a planet - moon system .",
    "a well known example is the jupiter - io system , of which a bright trail of foot - points of the magnetic - field lines traversed by io are observed on the surface of jupiter ( clarke et al 1996 ) .",
    "another type of unipolar inductor is a white dwarf - planet system .",
    "for such a system with an orbital period of 10 hrs , electrical energy with a power @xmath80  erg  s@xmath37 ( li , ferrario & wickramasinghe 1998 ) can be generated .",
    "a double - degenerate unipolar inductor can produce a large emf because of the strong magnetic field of primary dwarf and the large diameter of the secondary white dwarf .",
    "thus the electrical current and hence the power that it generates should be significantly larger than a planet - moon or a white dwarf - planet system .",
    "the details of the unipolar - inductor model for double - degenerate star are presented in wu et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "this model predicts x - ray emission from both magnetic poles .",
    "we would expect the emission from each foot - point to result in light curves which were ` top - hat ' in appearance .",
    "the x - ray light curves shown in figure 2 are consistent with a combination of two such light curves .",
    "further , if the foot - points of the current carrying field - lines remain fixed with respect to the secondary ( as in the jupiter - io system , clarke et al 1996 ) then asynchronous rotation will not manifest itself in orbital period changes .",
    "the stability of the x - ray light curves is consistent with this scenario .",
    "further , a luminosity of @xmath81 erg  s@xmath37 ( cf  [ extinc ] ) can be produced if the system deviates sufficiently from synchronism ( eg 1/1000 ; wu et al , 2002 ) . as there is no accretion column and no accretion shock , no strong emission lines or circular polarisation",
    "are expected .",
    "thus , the unipolar inductor can naturally account for the two main difficulties with the accretion models .",
    "we have presented optical and infrared spectra of rx j1914 + 24 : no strong emission lines are present .",
    "further , there is no evidence for significant levels of polarisation . in the double",
    "degenerate polar model , emission lines and detectable levels of polarisation are expected .",
    "it is , however , possible that the emission lines are too faint to have been detected in our spectra .",
    "we have also explored other alternative models : a double degenerate algol , a neutron star - white dwarf pair and a cosmic unipolar inductor .",
    "the latter model is attractive in that the non - detection of polarisation and emission lines is a natural consequence of this model .",
    "it can also account for the x - ray luminosity if the system has a small degree of asynchronism .",
