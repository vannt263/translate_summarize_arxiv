    "fission and spallation play a prominent role in nuclear physics , presenting paramount importance in nuclear reactions , being active fields of current investigation . nuclear energy , for instance , which followed the discovery of fission , has been of profound importance to mankind . besides , fission and spallation are interesting as a large scale collective motion of the nucleus , and they are important exit channels for many nuclear reactions as well .    fission is a slow process with respect to nuclear timescales , involving the deformation of the nucleus .",
    "the disintegration of the nucleus into two fragments of similar masses is accompanied by a complete rearrangement of the nuclear structure .",
    "the dynamical process that leads to fission determines the fragments features in the final states .",
    "a plethora of experimental investigations , regarding mass and energy distributions of fragments in the fission of nuclei from pb to no @xcite , has confirmed the validity of the hypothesis on the existence of independent fission modes , as first stated by turkevich and niday @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis has been reinforced by theoretical works by pashkevich @xcite and brosa @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "these studies showed that multimodality of the mass and energy distributions of fission fragments is due to the valley structure of the deformation potential energy surface of a fissioning nucleus .",
    "the properties of fragments produced in the fission of actinide and pre - actinide nuclei provide important information concerning the relationship among different fission components .",
    "spallation reactions , resulting from the interaction between high - energy projectiles and heavy target nuclei , can be straightforwardly described .",
    "in fact , the nucleons from a target nucleus are spalled due to the bombardment of an energetic nucleon , leaving behind fragments",
    ". their mass and atomic numbers are smaller than the ones associated to the target nucleus itself .",
    "serber was the first one to come up with the theoretical description of the spallation mechanism @xcite .",
    "he proposed a two stage model , consisting of a intra - nuclear cascade ( inc ) followed by statistical de - excitation . according to this framework",
    ", the first step is regarded in terms of collisions between the incident particle and the individual nuclear particles  nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "after the inc , the residual nucleus is left into an equilibrium state , wherein the excitation energy is shared by a large number of nucleons . if the excitation energy is greater than the binding energy of particles , emission of nucleons and light fragments ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) and other reaction channels  as evaporation , ( multi)fragmentation and fission  are possible . some of the nucleons ejected during the spallation reactions have sufficient energy to induce further spallation reaction with neighboring nuclei inside a thick target , leading to a multiplication of the emitted neutrons .",
    "it is therefore possible to produce intense neutron fluxes from high energy beams .",
    "these fluxes could compete with reactor ones .",
    "spallation reactions in heavy elements are also particularly interesting , since the fission process provides a prominent competing reaction , which can have effects on the cross sections of the other reactions .",
    "in this study the main aim is to discuss the prominent features of spallation and fission reactions in the context of the mechanism of interaction of intermediate- and high - energy projectiles with heavy nuclei .",
    "some examples of fundamental research on the dynamics of projectile - nucleus interaction will be presented .",
    "the determination of the distribution in @xmath9 and @xmath10 of the residual nuclei resulting from the interaction allows to estimate the contribution of the different reaction channels such as evaporation , ( multi)fragmentation and fission , the total reaction cross section .",
    "thereafter we will compare these contributions to previous investigations .",
    "the nuclear fission and spallation phenomena have been studied by several methods and techniques , including direct and inverse kinematics @xcite . in these studies the basic mechanism , responsible for the development of various processes that usually occur during the interaction between intermediate- and high - energy projectiles and heavy nuclei targets , has been determined . particularly , the experiments performed in inverse kinematics by schmidt @xmath5 @xcite represent the comprehensive study of the fission fragment charge distributions in a large variety of actinides and pre - actinides .",
    "on the other hand , the induced - activity method is a prominent and convenient tool to study the nuclear properties of reaction residues , based upon the @xmath11-ray spectroscopy .",
    "measurements by the induced - activity method allow to construct charge and mass distributions of reaction products , as well as to determine the main kinematic characteristics of reaction fragments and to estimate their angular momenta .",
    "the scientific interest of the results presented in this work is evinced by the main relevant data on numerous studies of nucleon - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus interactions that have been previously obtained in the literature .",
    "the investigations of the different reactions in various conditions of excitation can shed new light on the mechanism of reactions , and the features of interactions of the distinct nucleons with the nucleus can be derived .",
    "the modification of either the incident energy or the target nucleus ( or both ) leads to a very rich spectrum of phenomena that we present here , which have to be described theoretically .",
    "the next argument to present the main results of investigations is to provide conditions to understand how the mechanism of nucleon - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus interactions is modified , into transitions toward more complex systems .",
    "the nuclear data for the production of residual nuclides are basic quantities for the calculation of radioactive inventories of spallation targets in spallation neutron sources and in accelerator - driven devices for energy amplification and for transmutation of nuclear waste .",
    "finally , presenting such results has a great importance for the model and code improvement as well . a reliable and comprehensive experimental database for reactions",
    "should be extended by forthcoming further experimental investigations , in order to allow benchmarking of new developed models .",
    "in off - line experiment , the target nucleus is initially excited by an incident beam of charged particles , photons , neutrons or heavy - ions .",
    "hence the induced target is displayed into a special hall for measurements .",
    "after irradiation , both stable and radioactive nuclides are produced , being characterized by different half - lives and decay energies .",
    "high resolution ge @xmath11-ray spectrometry plays a prominent role in the experiment .",
    "@xmath11-ray spectrometry serves to identify radionuclides and to measure their activities .",
    "it is thus necessary to identify the energies of all @xmath11-rays of interest .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath11-spectra , the unambiguous identification of nuclides and the selection of activities used in the final calculation of cross section turned out to be the most time - consuming step in the experiments .",
    "the identification of the reaction products is conducted through the definition of the half - lives , energies and intensities of the nuclear @xmath11-transitions of the radioactive fragments @xcite .",
    "1 presents the @xmath11-spectrum from the irradiated @xmath1th sample at 50 mev bremsstrahlung photons , having measurement time of 30 h. the @xmath11-peak areas are used to calculate the cross sections of reaction products .",
    "a considerable amount of data has been obtained for nucleon - induced reactions on different targets by using induced - activity method @xcite .",
    "the main goal of these studies was to provide a database for model calculations of the production of cosmogenic nuclides in extraterrestrial matter by solar and galactic cosmic ray protons @xcite .",
    "therefore , the detailed subjects of such studies were dedicated mainly to measure of large amount of excitation functions of the reaction residues .",
    "we derive in what follows the framework for determination of the nuclide production cross section used in our investigations .",
    "the production of radioactive isotope is defined by the following differential equation : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the decay constant , @xmath14 is the cross section of a given isotope ( @xmath15 ( in 1/@xmath16 units ) , @xmath17 is the number of the produced isotope , @xmath18 denotes the incident particle beam intensity ( min@xmath19 ) , and @xmath20 stands for the number of target nuclei ( in 1/@xmath16 units ) .",
    "this equation is easily solved if @xmath18 does not depend upon the irradiation time . in this case , the number of nuclei formed during irradiation is determined by following equation : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the irradiation time .",
    "if we denote by @xmath23 the time of exposure between the end of the irradiation and the beginning of the measurement , then the number of formed nuclei of an isotope under interest will decrease exponentially as : @xmath24    hence , the number decays @xmath25 during the time of measurement @xmath26 reads @xmath27 from eq.(4 ) we can obtain the reaction fragment production cross section in the absence of a parent isotope  that may contribute to the measured cross section via @xmath28- decays  which usually considered as an independent cross section ( i ) by using the following equation : @xmath29 eq.(5 ) also takes into account the @xmath11-ray detection efficiency ( @xmath30 ) , the intensity of @xmath11-transitions ( @xmath31 ) , the total coefficient of @xmath11-ray absorption , both in the target and the detector materials ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "if the cross section of a given isotope includes a contribution from the @xmath28-decay of neighboring unstable isobars , the cross section calculation becomes more complicated ( diagram 1 ) . in these cases ,",
    "the measured number of isotope atoms is considered as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is an independent cross section , defined by eq.(5 ) , @xmath35 is the number of nuclei formed by the decay of the parent isotopes during the time of irradiation , and @xmath36 is the number of nuclei formed by the decay of the given isotopes after irradiation .",
    "a & ^f_ab & b    as a result , we obtain the following equation : @xmath37,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the subscripts @xmath10 and @xmath38 label variables referring to , respectively , the parent and the daughter nucleus ; the coefficient @xmath39 specifies the fraction of @xmath10 nuclei decaying to a @xmath38 nucleus ( @xmath40 , when the contribution from the @xmath41-decay corresponds 100% ) ; and @xmath42 is the total photo - peak area associated with the decays of the daughter and parent isotopes .",
    "if the cross section of formation of the parent isotope is known from experimental data , or if it can be estimated on the basis of other sources , hence the independent cross sections of daughter nuclei can be calculated by the relation @xcite : @xmath43,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the effect of the precursor can be negligible in some limiting cases .",
    "indeed , when either the half - life of the parent nucleus is very long or when its contribution is very small . in the case",
    "where the parent and daughter isotopes can not be experimentally separated , the calculated cross sections are classified as cumulative ones ( c ) .",
    "it should be mentioned that the use of the induced - activity method imposes several restrictions on the registration of the reaction products .",
    "for example , it is not possible to measure stable and very short - living isotopes .    in our experiments , the irradiation time , @xmath22 , is usually chosen from a few minutes to several hours .",
    "the time @xmath23 changes from various minutes to several months , and the time of measurements , @xmath26 , varies from various minutes to several dozens of hours .",
    "the target is consistently measured several times .",
    "the advantage of choosing the time by this scheme is that it allows to measure with high precision and accuracy the cross section of reaction products within a wide range of half - lives , from short - lived ( dozens of minutes ) to long ones .",
    "the reliability of the obtained data such as , for instance , charge and mass distributions , strongly depends upon the number of independent cross sections measured in the experiment . in such purpose ,",
    "the formula that takes into account the @xmath41-decay feeding of two precursors , has been elaborated .",
    "let us consider the scheme of three nuclei decay ( or three different states of nuclei ) ( diagram 2 ) .",
    "for example , @xmath10 may represent isomeric state and @xmath38 the ground state of the nucleus under study ) .",
    "after analogous assumptions we will have @xcite :    a & ^f_ac & c & & + ^f_ab &  f_bc & & ( 1,1 ) & + b & & & & + & ( 1,1 ) & & & + & & & & +    @xmath44,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where for simplicity we define : @xmath45 finally , one can obtain the formula of production cross section for @xmath46-nucleus : @xmath47 -   \\frac{\\lambda_{b}}{\\lambda_{b}-\\lambda_{c } } \\sigma_{b}\\biggl(f_{bc } + f_{ab}f_{bc } \\frac{\\lambda_{b}}{\\lambda_{b}-\\lambda_{c } } \\left(1 + \\frac{\\lambda_{a}}{\\lambda_{a}-\\lambda_{b}}\\right)\\biggr ) \\nonumber\\\\&&\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad- \\sigma_{a } f_{ac } \\frac{\\lambda_{a}}{\\lambda_{a}-\\lambda_{c}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the application of the induced - activity method allows to study the important features of the reaction in different nuclei and in wide energy ranges , such as the charge , spin and mass distributions of the target residues , and kinematics characteristics as well .",
    "it represents a straightforward method to measure the high - spin states of nuclides .",
    "achieved results of the above mentioned method are very important for both theoretical and practical point of view .",
    "moreover , study of the light nuclei structure is very interesting from astrophysical aspects .",
    "on the other hand the induced - activity method allows simultaneously to investigate such processes as fission , ( multi)fragmentation and evaporation - spallation .",
    "thus , one can reconstruct the whole picture of interaction and investigate different reaction channels on different target and in wide energy ranges .",
    "the multimodal fission approach @xcite is based on the assumption that experimental mass distributions are a superposition of mass distributions of individual fission modes .",
    "these modes are produced by the valley structure of the deformation potential energy surface .",
    "it is supposed that there are three distinct fission modes for the heavy nuclei ",
    "symmetric ( s ) mode and two asymmetric modes  standard 1 ( s1 ) and standard 2 ( s2 ) .",
    "s mode fragments are strongly elongated with masses around @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is a mass of fissioning nucleus .",
    "the s1 mode is characterized by high kinetic energies of fission fragments , spherical mass of heavy fragment @xmath50 , charge @xmath51 and number of neutron @xmath52 .",
    "kinetic energies of s2 mode fragments are lower than those of s1 mode , heavy slightly deformed fragments has mass @xmath53 , influenced by the deformed proton shell @xmath54 and neutron shells @xmath55 .    according to the model @xcite , the total mass - yield is obtained by the sum of the three gaussian functions @xcite : @xmath56 ,   \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the fragment mass number ; @xmath57 is the mean mass number , which determines the center of the gaussian functions ; and @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 denote the contribution , dispersion and position parameters of the @xmath61 gaussian functions .",
    "the indexes @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively designate the asymmetric and symmetric components .      competition between symmetric and asymmetric fission is thought to be connected to shell effects in the deformed nucleus .",
    "the presence of these shell structures leads to the existence of symmetric and asymmetric fission modes or channels .",
    "the contribution of each fission mode that changes with excitation energy as well as shell effects fade with higher excitation energy , leaving a nucleus which merely possesses a symmetric fission mode .    using the electron beams obtained at the synchrophasotron of yerevan physics institute we investigated the photofission reactions in @xmath0u , @xmath1th and @xmath2ta targets at the bremsstrahlung end - point energies 50 and 3500 mev .",
    "the details of the measurements can be found in @xcite .",
    "the measurements of radionuclides production yields allowed to determine the distribution in @xmath9 and @xmath10 of the residual nuclei resulting from the interaction .",
    "the yields of stable and short - lived nuclei unmeasurable by induced - activity method , were estimated by using the approximation with gaussian functions for charge distributions @xcite : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the independent yield of the nuclide ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "the values @xmath67 ( the total chain yield for given mass number @xmath10 ) , @xmath68 ( the most probable charge for @xmath9 distribution isobars for mass chain @xmath10 ) and @xmath46 ( the width parameter of distribution ) were considered as a free parameters .",
    "the relative contributions of symmetric and asymmetric channels could be quite different for different fissioning nuclei .",
    "fission is well known to be predominantly symmetric for pre - actinides with @xmath69 and for heavy actinides with @xmath70 .",
    "however , for actinides @xmath71 , fission is a mixture of two channels ( asymmetric and symmetric ) .",
    "furthermore , the standard channel splits into s1 and s2 channels @xcite .",
    "the mass distributions obtained during the fitting procedure for @xmath0u , @xmath1th and @xmath2ta at end - point energy @xmath72 mev are plotted in figs . 2 - 7 .",
    "in the case regarding 50 mev , the mass - yield for @xmath0u , @xmath1th targets were decomposed in assumption of mixture distribution , for @xmath2ta target the representation has agreed with the assumption of a symmetric mass distribution .    in the analysis of experiments with bremsstrahlung beam , the latter has a continuous spectrum .",
    "hence , the measurements at high energy include also low - energy photons .",
    "taking into account such aspect , to the decomposition of mass - yield at e@xmath73 = 3500 mev for @xmath0u , @xmath1th targets , we added two additional components , one symmetric and one asymmetric ( figs . 5 , 6 ) .",
    "integrating over the gaussian and multiplying by a factor 1/2 , due to the two fission fragments in each fission event , it gives an estimate for the total fission yield for each target .",
    "the values for the total fission yield ( @xmath74 ) , determined in this way , together with the contribution of symmetric ( @xmath75 ) and asymmetric ( @xmath76 ) fission to the total mass - yield as well as the values of the asymmetric - to - symmetric ratios ( @xmath77 ) are given in table 1 .",
    "the decomposition of the mass - yield distribution for @xmath0u , @xmath1th targets allowed to extract the yields of an asymmetric component at intermediate energies , from 50 mev to 3500 mev , for @xmath0u ( @xmath78 mb / eq.q . ) and @xmath1th ( @xmath79 mb / eq.q . ) targets . from the data",
    "obtained it follows that the asymmetric component is stronger in the case of @xmath0u .",
    "the presence of an asymmetric component in this energy range may be due to the low - energy photons of bremsstrahlung spectrum .",
    "comparison of the symmetric fission contribution in energy range from 50 mev to 3500 mev showed , that this mode is greater for @xmath1th ( @xmath80 mb / eq.q . ) than for @xmath0u ( @xmath81 mb / eq.q . ) .",
    "one can observe the clearly manifested growth of symmetric fission , when consider the relative contribution of this component to the total fission yield ( @xmath82 , % ) in energy range 50 - 3500 mev : for @xmath0u this value is 58% , and for the @xmath1th it corresponds to 72% .",
    "the increment of the symmetric fission contribution with increasing energy of the projectile can be caused due to several factors .",
    "on the one hand , an increment of the incident energy increases excitation energy of the fissioning nuclei @xcite , and hence the contribution symmetric binary nuclear decay increases . while the contribution of low - energy fission essentially asymmetric in nature . from another hand , because of the particle evaporation process that takes place before fission , a set of various fissioning nuclides exists . each of them has its own fission characteristics , excitation energy and angular momentum distributions . the symmetric component increases with excitation energy , which is coupled to an increment of neutron evaporation resulting in a larger contribution of the neutron deficient nuclides with a higher fissility parameter .",
    "the excitation energy for which symmetric fission starts to contribute gives rise to an amount of evaporated nucleons , corresponding to a certain neutron deficient nuclei .",
    "these nuclei are responsible for the symmetric contribution growth .",
    "the systematization of symmetric and asymmetric fission cross sections in a wide range of nuclei collected in @xcite showed that it is possible to use the empirical expression for estimation the probability of different fission modes . in order to characterize this factor quantitatively",
    ", the authors introduced a critical value of the fissility parameter in the following form : @xmath83 where @xmath9 is a charge of the fissioning nucleus and @xmath10 is mass of fissioning nucleus . according to @xcite , for the nuclei with @xmath84 values greater than the critical value ,",
    "the symmetric fission mode was dominant .",
    "however , at smaller values of the fissility parameter , the main fission channel leads to an asymmetric fragment distribution .",
    "the larger contribution of symmetric fission for @xmath1th than for @xmath0u at high energies one can explain by larger contribution of neutron deficient fissioning systems with high excitation energies .",
    "the prediction of the multimode - fission model has been used for the first time to analyze the mass distributions of fragments originating from @xmath3am , @xmath0u and @xmath4np targets irradiated by 660-mev protons @xcite ( figures 8 - 10 ) .",
    "the determination of fundamental properties of individual components of the mass distribution and the contributions of these components as well has made it possible to establish a dominant role of the symmetric fission mode ( table 2 ) at this energy range . since the neutrons and protons numbers are almost the same for @xmath3am and @xmath4np , the relative fractions of the different fission components are similar . in our measurements",
    "the mean masses of the fissioning nuclei at a given proton energy were obtained @xmath85 , @xmath86 ( @xmath87 for @xmath3am ) ; @xmath85 , @xmath88 ( @xmath89 for @xmath0u ) ; @xmath90 , @xmath91 ( @xmath92 for @xmath4np ) , where @xmath49 and @xmath93 are the mass and the charge of the fissioning nucleus , respectively . according to the criterion ( 13 ) ,",
    "the difference between @xmath84 and @xmath94 is greater for @xmath3am and @xmath4np nuclei .",
    "therefore symmetric fission in these nuclides is expressed stronger than for @xmath0u .",
    "the presence of the asymmetric fission component may be attributed to a broad mass and excitation energy distributions of fissioning nuclei .    in the above mentioned photo- and proton - induced fission reactions , we estimated the fissility of actinides under study .",
    "the fissility ( @xmath95 ) is defined as the ratio of total fission cross section ( @xmath96 ) and the total inelastic cross section @xmath97 .",
    "the total fission cross sections were determined by using a fitting based on eq . ( 11 ) , and the total inelastic cross section values were estimated using cascade - evaporation model @xcite .",
    "11 shows the fissility for @xmath3am , @xmath0u , @xmath4np and @xmath1th targets from data for photo- and proton - induced fission @xcite , as a function of the fissility parameter ( @xmath84 ) of the fissioning nucleus . from fig .",
    "11 one can see that the fission probability increases while going to the higher values of the fissility parameter : the fissility of the heavier element is higher .",
    "all fissility values for the targets studied in the case of fission induced by protons and photons at different energies are still below unit .",
    "this fact indicates a saturation of the fission probability for heavy nuclei at intermediate energy range .",
    "moreover , for @xmath0u target the fissility has the same value in both photo- and proton - induced fission reactions .",
    "the dependence of fissility of @xmath3am , @xmath0u , @xmath4np and @xmath1th targets for photo- and proton - induced fission @xcite on excitation energy of fissioning nucleus are shown on fig .",
    "12 together with experimental data of different probes and calculations from @xcite .",
    "the excitation energy values for the reactions under study have been taken from @xcite . in @xcite a semi - empirical approach for the fission probability of neutron- , proton- and photon - induced fission in the energy range from several tens of mev to 3 gev has been proposed . as can be realized from fig .",
    "12 , regarding data from different experiments obtained in reactions with proton , neutrons , and photons , the data respective to our work is in satisfactory agreement .",
    "this fact confirms the universal mechanism of nuclear fission , which depends on the excitation energy as well as upon mass and charge characteristics of the fissioning nucleus and does not depend on the type of projectile .",
    "our investigation has been devoted to the analysis of the experimental results obtained in photo- and proton - induced reactions with actinides @xcite using the simulation code crisp @xcite .",
    "crisp is a monte carlo code for simulating nuclear reactions , where the reactions proceed in the two stages : the intranuclear cascade ( mcmc code ) and the evaporation / fission process ( mcef code ) .",
    "crisp code calculated spallation yields and neutron multiplicities for reactions induced by high - energy protons , as well as has already been used in studies of the accelerator driving system ( ads ) nuclear reactors @xcite .",
    "the main feature of the intranuclear cascade calculation with crisp is the multicollisional approach @xcite where the full nuclear dynamics is considered in each step of the cascade . in this process",
    "the nucleus is modelled by an infinite square - potential which determines the level structure for protons and neutrons .",
    "the effects of the nuclear potential are present in the transmission of the particles through the nuclear surface or through an effective mass according to the walecka mean field approximation @xcite",
    ". one important feature of the code , in simulating the intranuclear cascade , is the pauli blocking mechanism , which avoids violation of the pauli principle . in the crisp code",
    "a strict verification of this principle is performed at each step of the cascade , resulting in a more realistic simulation of the process .",
    "after nuclear thermalization , the competition between fission and evaporation processes , which includes neutrons , protons and @xmath6-particles , is determined by the ratios between their respective widths according to the weisskopf model for evaporation and to the bohr - wheeler model for fission .",
    "these ratios are given by : @xmath98 \\right\\rbrace ,   \\label{gamap}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath99   \\right\\rbrace .",
    "\\label{gamaa}\\ ] ] for evaporation and by @xmath100   \\right\\rbrace ,   \\label{gamaf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath101}{(4a^{2/3}a_f e_n ) } ,   \\label{kf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for fission .",
    "the parameters @xmath102 stand for the density levels calculated by dostrovsky s parametrization @xcite and @xmath103 is given by @xmath104 where @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the separation energies for neutrons , protons and alphas , respectively , and @xmath108 is the fission barrier .",
    "@xmath109 stands for the coulomb potential . at each @xmath110 step of the evaporation ,",
    "the excitation energy of the compound nucleus is modified by @xmath111 where @xmath112 denotes the kinetic energy of the emitted particle .",
    "it should be noted that the crisp does not describe the ( multi)fragmentation process of nuclei at the current stage of calculation , however the initial work of implementation is already in the progress .",
    "the fission process has been successfully described by the multimodal fission approach ( it also called as random neck rupture model ( mm - rnrm ) ) @xcite , based on the collective effects of nuclear deformation during fission via a liquid - drop model and takes into account a single - particle effects via microscopic shell model corrections .",
    "crisp code was then adapted to consider the multimodal approach by using the eq.(11 ) .",
    "considering the different channels of fission , crisp reproduced different aspects of photo- and proton - induced fission as the spectrum of fissioning nuclei , charge- and mass - distribution of the fission fragments , calculate the fissility values for actinides under study .",
    "the calculation by crisp allowed us also to distinguish the pre- and post - scission neutrons , and compare this values with experimental values of total neutrons emission .",
    "the results from crisp together with experimental isobaric distribution for photo- and proton - induced fission reactions in actinide targets are shown in figs .",
    "13 and 14 , respectively @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , the agreement between the calculation and the experimental data is fairly good for both type of reactions .",
    "such agreement is clearly shown for low energies photons ( fig .",
    "13 ( a , b ) ) , where the calculations reproduce the experimental features quite well . at bremsstrahlung energy 3500 mev",
    "the discrepancy becomes larger .",
    "the reason of it could be explained by the continuous character of bremsstrahlung spectrum due to influence of low - energy part .",
    "however , in the case of th we can see more realistic calculations even at high energy of photons . for proton - induced fission ( fig .",
    "14 ) , the calculations reproduce the shape of the experimental distributions : position and width of the peaks for symmetric and asymmetric modes are in fair agreement with the experimental data . however , the calculated distributions by crisp code are systematically below the data for @xmath3am and @xmath4np targets , indicating that the calculations of total fission cross sections underestimate the experimental ones .    another very interesting phenomenon of fission , that has been confirmed by crisp calculation , is the presence of superasymmetric binary fission in @xmath0u and @xmath4np targets at proton energy 660 mev @xcite .",
    "we have applied the induced - activity method to identify unambiguously in general 115 isotopes as a intermediate - mass fragment ( imf ) in the mass range @xmath113 u. there is a consideration that the formed nuclides could be produced in a very asymmetric binary decay of heavy nuclei originating from the spallation of heavy targets .",
    "the imfs , i.e. particles heavier than helium isotopes but lighter than fission residues , appear as reaction products for all target nuclei . as it was discussed in @xcite",
    ", imfs was observed in the binary decay of a compound nucleus includes fission and evaporation with a natural transition in between , may appear from the first reaction stage excited sufficiently high residual , and it might be called fission in a generalized sense .",
    "one of the possible ways of the origin of imfs is that they represent the products of the fission of a species with @xmath114 u @xcite . or , for instance",
    ", deep spallation may be accompanied not only by emission of nucleons and light charge particles but emission of imfs .",
    "an alternative explanation of the origin of the products with @xmath115 u was suggested by the intranuclear cascade model @xcite , according which these fragments are the result of the fission of species with @xmath116 u that are highly excited .",

    "we conclude that intermediate mass fragments produce mainly as a result of the binary decay of the excited nuclei produced at the first stage of the collisions and the contribution of the ( multi)fragmentation process for all targets is small .    to take into account the possibility of a superasymmetric fission , we included the additional asymmetric mode , s3 , to the crisp code , which can be described by the usual gaussian shape from mm - nrm . in fig .",

    "the calculations not only give a schematic description of reality , but they enable us to improve the data from previous calculations @xcite and estimate the part of the fission cross section originating from symmetric and asymmetric fission modes .",
    "the superasymmetric mode contributes with 0.6% and 1.2% of the total fission cross section for the @xmath0u and @xmath4np targets , respectively .",

    "the effect of the excitation energy on the probability of product formation in different spin states may be displayed in two ways .",
    "first , the spin of the primary fission fragment increases with the increase of excitation energy due to contribution of higher degrees of freedom into the collective motion ; second , the difference in the excitation energy causes the difference in the de - excitation process , so during the evaporation of neutrons and @xmath11-quanta a broad distribution is obtained for fragments with higher excitation energy .",
