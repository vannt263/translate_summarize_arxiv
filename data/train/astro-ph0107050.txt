    "polars , or am her systems , are interacting binary systems in which the magnetic field of the accreting white dwarf is strong enough to prevent the formation of an accretion disc .",
    "it also forces the spin period of the white dwarf to be synchronised with the binary orbital period . in these systems",
    ", the accreting material leaves the red dwarf secondary , follows a ballistic trajectory before getting coupled by the magnetic field of the white dwarf and funnelled directly onto the white dwarf surface .    just above the white dwarf",
    "photosphere , the accretion flow is strongly shocked , at which point the temperature reaches @xmath150kev . some of this radiation is intercepted by the white dwarf where it is thermalised and re - radiated as soft x - rays .",
    "an additional source of soft x - rays is dense blobs of material which penetrate into the white dwarf photosphere and heat it directly .",
    "in addition , there is a cyclotron component which is strongest in the optical band ( for the magnetic field strength found in polars : @xmath110200 mg ) .",
    "this arises from electrons spiralling around the magnetic field lines close to the shock .",
    "prior to the launch of the _ rosat _ x - ray satellite in 1990 the relative strength of the three emission components was a major issue ( eg king & watson 1987 ) .",
    "observations of several polars showed that the strength of the soft x - ray component relative to the hard x - ray component was in excess of that predicted by simple accretion models ( eg heise et al 1985 ) . with the results derived using _",
    "it became clear that many polars showed this ` soft x - ray excess ' ( ramsay et al .",
    "1994 ) . during epochs",
    "when the accretion rate was in an ` intermediate ' level of accretion , ramsay , cropper & mason ( 1995 ) found that the relative strength of the soft x - ray flux was less than in ` high ' accretion states : indeed am her showed a ` soft x - ray deficiency ' in this state .",
    "they hypothesized that for lower accretion rates , a shock does not form over the whole of the accretion region .",
    "a significant uncertainty in the results of ramsay et al ( 1994 ) was the poor constraint on the hard x - ray flux since _ rosat _ did not extend to energies much higher than @xmath12kev . with the launch of _ xmm - newton _",
    "we are able , for the first time , to detect both the soft and hard x - ray components clearly .",
    "this paper presents an analysis of the spectra of the first polars to be observed using _ xmm - newton_.",
    "dp leo and ww hor were observed using _ xmm - newton _ in nov and dec 2000 respectively : the observation log is shown in table [ obslog ] .",
    "both objects were detected in all three epic detectors ( turner et al 2001 , stder et al 2001 ) , which were configured in full window mode and used the thin filter . neither object was detected in the rgs detectors . during the dp leo observations ,",
    "there were time intervals of enhanced particle background .",
    "these intervals were removed from the spectral analysis , reducing the exposure by 16ksec in the epic detectors .",
    "the observations of ww hor were not significantly effected by increased particle background . by comparing the x - ray and optical flux with previous observations , it was concluded that both systems were in an intermediate state of accretion ( cf pandel et al 2001 ) .    before extracting source spectra ,",
    "the data were processed using the first public release of the _ xmm - newton _ science analysis system .",
    "spectra were extracted from the epic pn camera data using an aperture of @xmath2 in radius centered on the source , chosen so that the aperture did not cover more than one ccd .",
    "this encompasses @xmath185 percent of the integrated psf ( aschenbach et al 2000 ) . in the case of the epic mos data ,",
    "the source was in the centre of the ccd and a radius of @xmath3 was used ( encompassing @xmath190 percent of the integrated psf ) .",
    "background spectra were extracted from the same ccd on which the source was detected , scaled and subtracted from the source spectra .    since the response of the epic pn detector is not well calibrated at present below @xmath10.2kev , energies below this were ignored in the subsequent analysis .",
    "also the pn response function used assumes only single pixel events , so we extracted only these events to construct our pn spectrum . for the epic mos detectors , which are currently better calibrated at lower energies , we fitted energies above 0.1kev .",
    "the response files used in the analysis are listed in table [ response ] .",

    "the integrated epic pn and mos1 spectra of ww hor are shown in figure [ wwspec ] . whilst we observe hard x - ray emission above 2kev in ww hor for the first time",
    ", there is no evidence for a soft blackbody component with the sort of temperature seen in dp leo .",
    "this is unusual , since even for systems in a reduced rate of accretion a soft x - ray component is expected .",
    "weak fe k@xmath4 line emission is present at 6.7 kev . in the pn spectrum",
    "there is evidence for an emission line due to fe fluorescence near 6.4kev .",
    "we modelled the integrated epic spectra from each detector separately using the model described in ",
    "[ model ] together with a neutral absorber . as in dp leo",
    "we fix , at 1 g s@xmath5 @xmath6 , @xmath7 at 10 and the metal abundance at solar .",
    "we obtain good fits : the best fit model parameters are shown in table [ fits ] .",
    "we find a very low absorption column .",
    "the mass of the white dwarf is @xmath11.1@xmath0 . using a distance of 430pc ( bailey et al 1988 ) we estimate the unabsorbed , hard bolometric luminosity to be @xmath8 ergs s@xmath5",
    "this is similar to that found for other am her systems in intermediate accretion states ( ramsay , cropper & mason 1995 ) . indeed , when we compare the phase averaged observed flux in the 0.12.0kev band in _ xmm - newton _",
    "( @xmath9 ergs s@xmath5 @xmath6 in mos1 ) with the _ rosat _ observation of ww hor , made when it was in an intermediate state ( @xmath10 ergs s@xmath5 @xmath6 ) , we find that they are very similar .",
    "we can investigate whether a low temperature soft x - ray component could be absorbed by a modest absorption column . in the lowest energy bands the best calibrated instrument is the epic mos1 detector .",
    "we added a blackbody component with temperature @xmath11=10 and 15 ev to the model used above ( cf @xmath1230 ev for dp leo ) .",
    "we find that such a low temperature blackbody is ` hidden ' by an absorption column consistent with our upper limit ( 5.6@xmath13 @xmath6 ) .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath14 is 8.5@xmath15 and 4.3@xmath15 ergs s@xmath5for 10 and 15ev respectively .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath16=0.4 and 0.2 : these values are broadly similar to that found for polars in intermediate accretion states ( ramsay , cropper & mason 1995 ) .",
    "( 15,10 ) ( -16,-1 . )    ( -4,3.8 )",
    "when ww hor was observed using _ rosat _",
    "it was found that both a blackbody and a bremsstrahlung component were required to fit the x - ray spectrum ( ramsay , cropper & mason 1995 ) . when ww hor was observed using _ xmm - newton",
    "_ , it was at very similar x - ray flux levels compared to the _ rosat _ observation .",
    "further , the x - ray bolometric luminosity of ww hor is approximately similar to dp leo ( implying similar mass transfer rates ) if we assume similar distances . why do we therefore observe a soft x - ray component in dp leo and",
    "not ww hor ?",
    "we suggest that the accretion region was more spread out in the _ xmm - newton _ observation of ww hor compared to the _ rosat _ observation , thereby decreasing the local heating rate and causing the temperature of any soft x - ray component to decrease .",
    "if it was sufficiently low ( say @xmath17=10 or 15ev ) , we showed in  [ wwhor ] that even a very modest amount of absorption would prevent us from detecting this soft x - ray component .",
    "it is not clear why the accretion region would cover a larger area of the white dwarf .",
    "one possible reason could be that for relatively low mass transfer rates , accretion occurs onto a wide range of magnetic azimuths , resulting in a more extended accretion region .",
    "this is thought to be one of the reasons why intermediate polars ( which have less strong magnetic fields than polars ) do not show a soft x - ray component ( eg king & lasota 1990 ) .",
    "we now briefly comment on the derived masses for the white dwarfs in these systems . in the case of ww hor",
    ", we find a mass of @xmath11.1@xmath0and for dp leo @xmath181.3@xmath0(table [ fits ] ) .",
    "the mass of the white dwarf in both systems is at the upper end of expectations .",
    "there are no other accurate estimates for the mass of the white dwarf in these two systems .",
    "several magnetic cvs were found to have similar masses to ww hor in the survey of such systems using _ rxte _ data and the same emission model as used here ( ramsay 2000 ) .",
    "similarly , the mass of sirius b is 1.034@xmath190.026 ( holberg et al 1998 ) .",
    "other massive non - accreting white dwarfs have been found ( eg re j0317858 ; 1.311.37@xmath0 , ferrario et al 1997 ) . in the case of dp leo ,",
    "however , the mass of the white dwarf is very heavy indeed and would be the heaviest white dwarf within an accreting magnetic system yet found .",
    "ramsay ( 2000 ) found that the mass distribution of isolated non - magnetic white dwarfs and white dwarfs in magnetic cvs are significantly different : the white dwarfs in magnetic cvs are biased towards heavier masses .",
    "however , it was not clear if this was due to selection effects : it is possible that high mass polars are more likely to be discovered than low mass polars .    in calculating the mass of the white dwarf we use the nauenberg ( 1972 ) approximation for the white dwarf mass - radius relationship :",
    "this approximates the hamada & salpeter ( 1961 ) mass - radius relationship for carbon white dwarfs over the range 0.31.2 @xmath0 , and is consistent with the best mass - radius data for the white dwarfs 40 erib and sirius b ( provencal et al 1988 ) .",
    "however the appropriate mass - radius relationship is still a matter of debate . in the case of dp leo ,",
    "where we estimate a white dwarf of mass @xmath181.3@xmath0 , there is some additional uncertainty for our mass estimate since for the very heaviest white dwarfs the mass - radius relationship is very uncertain .",
    "hamada & salpeter ( 1961 ) also show the mass - radius relationship for fe core white dwarfs .",
    "white dwarfs with fe cores are thought to be formed when a white dwarf with a onemg core ignites through an accretion - drived collapse ( isern , canal & labay 1991 ) .",
    "the maximum mass for such a white dwarf is @xmath11.1@xmath0 . using this mass - radius relationship",
    "we obtain a mass of @xmath11.1@xmath0 , again close to the maximum .",
    "alternatively , it is possible that additional cooling processes not included in our model could become important for white dwarfs greater than 1.0@xmath0 .",
    "this would have the effect of modifying the temperature - height profile of the post - shock region and hence the implied x - ray spectrum .",
    "if the volume of gas emitting 10kev was underestimated , then this may also account for the deficit of fe line emission in dp leo (  [ dpleo ] ) .",
    "in general , however , additional cooling terms work to soften the x - ray spectrum , resulting in a higher gravitational potential ( and hence white dwarf mass ) to fit the observed spectrum .",
    "it is also possible that the absorption is more complex than a simple neutral absorber , as was found to be the case in the polar by cam ( done & magdziarz 1998 ) .",
    "this would make the continuum appear harder , so overestimating the shock temperature and hence the white dwarf mass .",
    "the higher temperature continuum would also underpredict the plasma iron lines fluxes .",
    "given that both these features are seen in our model fits , we added a partial covering component and also an ionized absorption component to our model . the resulting fits and masses",
    "were not significantly improved with the exception of the mos1 data which gave masses which were 0.10.2 @xmath0lighter .",
    "data of higher signal to noise would be required to test the necessity of more complex absorption models .",
    "based on observations obtained with xmm - newton , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and the usa ( nasa ) .",
