    "soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) are a class of peculiar high - energy sources discovered through their recurrent emission of soft @xmath0-ray bursts .",
    "these bursts have typical durations of @xmath10.1 s and luminosities in the range 10@xmath2 - 10@xmath3 ergs s@xmath4 ( see @xcite for a review of this class of objects ) . occasionally , sgrs also emit giant bursts that last up to a few hundred seconds and exhibit remarkable pulsations that reveal their spin periods ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the bursting activity and the persistent emission observed in the @xmath10.5 - 10 kev energy range are generally explained in the framework of the `` magnetar '' model ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , as caused by a highly magnetized ( @xmath510@xmath6 g ) slowly rotating ( @xmath7 5 - 8 s ) neutron star . in this model magnetic dissipation causes the neutron star crust to fracture .",
    "these fractures generate sudden shifts in the magnetospheric footpoints , which trigger the generation of alfvn pulses , which in turn accelerate electrons above the pair - production threshold , resulting quickly in an optically thick pair - photon plasma .",
    "the cooling of this plasma generates the typical short bursts of soft @xmath0-ray radiation .",
    "the longer bursts are powered by magnetic reconnection , and involve the entire neutron star magnetosphere .",
    "sgr 180620 is one of the most active soft gamma - ray repeaters .",
    "here we report new observations of this source obtained with the integral satellite in september and october 2003 during a period of moderate bursting activity @xcite .",
    "these data have two advantages compared to previous observations in the soft @xmath0-ray energy range of bursts from this source .",
    "first , they have been obtained with an imaging instrument , thus we can exclude that the bursts originate from a different source in the field .",
    "second , they have a good sensitivity and time resolution which allows us to study the spectral evolution of relatively faint bursts .",
    "in july 2003 a new active period of was detected by the ipn ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the source remained active throughout the month of august and so an integral target of opprotunity observation ( too ) was triggered .",
    "integral observed it for 240 ks starting on september 3 2003 , and 3 faint bursts were detected .",
    "afterwards the monitoring of the source continued during the galactic center deep exposure ( gdce ) as part of integral core program observations ( yielding an additional exposure of about @xmath11 ms on the source ) , during which 21 bursts have been detected .",
    "all the bursts have been detected and localized in near real time by the integral burst alert system ( ibas ; @xcite ) , using ibis @xcite data in the 15 - 200 kev range .",
    "the burst detection rate vs. time is shown in fig .",
    "[ detection ] .",
    "all the bursts have been localized within 2 arcminutes from the x - ray position of the quiescent counterpart @xcite . since the typical error circle is 2.5 arcmin ( 90% c.l .",
    ", see @xcite ) , we are confident that all the bursts originate from and not from the possible newly discovered soft gamma - ray repeater sgr 1808 - 20 @xcite , which is located at 15 arcmin from the source .",
    "we have analyzed only isgri @xcite data , since picsit @xcite in its standard operation mode does not have the combined time resolution and sensitivity to study such short bursts .",
    "the background subtracted ibis / isgri light curves of the bursts , binned at 10 ms , are shown in fig .",
    "[ lc ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in order to increase the signal - to - noise - ratio , they were extracted from isgri pixels illuminated by the source for at least half of their surface and selecting counts in the 15 - 100 kev energy range ( most of the bursts had little or no signal at higher energy ) .",
    "the bursts were detected at various off - axis angles , ranging from 2.5 to 13.3 degrees , corresponding to a variation of 80% in the instrument effective area .",
    "the light curves shown in fig .",
    "[ lc ] have been corrected for this vignetting effect .",
    "the total number of net counts actually recorded for each burst is indicated in the corresponding panel .",
    "the burst positions in instrumental coordinates are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fov ] ( see also tab . [ bigtab2 ] ) .    as can be seen most of the bursts",
    "are located in the partially coded field of view of ibis .",
    "a few bursts fall within the jem - x @xcite field of view , but unfortunately they are the faintest ones .",
    "the only burst for which a simultaneous ibis / jem - x detection has been obtained ( see fig .",
    "[ ibisjemx ] ) , is the one with instrumental coordinates y=0.97@xmath8 and z=2.22@xmath8 ( burst number 8) .",
    "this burst has a rather small fluence : 2.2@xmath910@xmath10 erg @xmath11 ( 15 - 100 kev )",
    ".    none of the bursts has been found in a preliminary analysis of spi @xcite data , but further analysis is underway .",
    "only one burst fell into the omc @xcite field of view , but the large extinction towards the object ( a@xmath12 30 mag ) prevents the detection of any optical emission ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the light curves shown in fig .",
    "[ lc ] have shapes typical for sgr bursts . from the light curves we determined the @xmath13 duration of each burst ( i.e. the time during which 90% of the total burst counts are accumulated ) .",
    "the @xmath13 values , reported in tab .",
    "[ bigtab2 ] , range typically from @xmath10.1 to @xmath10.2 s for single peaked bursts and can be as long as @xmath10.6 s for double peaked bursts .",
    "in fact the @xmath13 values of these bursts include the `` interpulse '' period .",
    "some bursts are preceded by a small precursor .",
    "the peak flux and fluence for each burst were first derived in counts units from the light curves of fig.[lc ] , and then converted to physical units adopting a constant conversion factor derived from the spectral analysis of the brightest bursts ( see below ) .",
    "the resulting 15 - 100 kev peak fluxes and fluences are reported in tab .",
    "[ bigtab2 ] and are respectively in the range ( 450)@xmath14 erg @xmath11 s@xmath4 ( @xmath15=10 ms ) and ( 260)@xmath16 erg @xmath11 .",
    "their integral distributions are shown in fig .",
    "[ log ] .    within the large uncertainties ,",
    "the fluence distribution is consistent with the power law slope found by @xcite using _ rxte _ data .",
    "many of these bursts are the faintest ever imaged from sgrs at these energies .    for the bursts with more than 500 net counts we could perform a detailed spectral analysis .",
    "the 15 - 200 kev spectra , integrated over the whole duration of each burst , were well fitted by an optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung ( ottb ) model , which is the spectral model that typically provides good fits to sgr bursts above 20 kev . using the latest available response matrices , we measured temperatures ( @xmath17 ) between 32 to 42 kev .",
    "these values are in the typical range of temperatures found in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) for short bursts from .",
    "we tried other models , like a power law or a black body , but they were clearly ruled out .",
    "small known calibration uncertainties at low energies ( @xmath18 40 kev ) do not affect much our spectra , whose errors are dominated rather by statistical uncertainties than by systematic ones .",
    "the ottb fit to the spectrum of burst number 22 is shown as an example in fig .",
    "[ sp ] .",
    "adopting a temperature @xmath17=38 kev ( consistent with the average spectra of the brightest bursts ) we derived a conversion factor of 1 count s@xmath4 = 1.5@xmath910@xmath19 erg @xmath11 s@xmath4 ( 15 - 100 kev ) , which we adopted for all the bursts .",
    "@xcite have used these data , to investigate the time evolution of the bursts spectra , using time - resolved hardness ratios ( @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the background subtracted counts in the ranges 40 - 100 kev and 15 - 40 kev respectively ) . analyzing the 12 bursts with more than 200 net counts , they found that some bursts show a significant spectral evolution , while others , particularly those with a `` flat topped '' profile , do not .",
    "some examples are given in fig .",
    "[ trehr ] .",
    "in addition the variation of the hardness ratio versus intensity ( @xmath23 ) has been investigated . considering all the time bins of all the bursts ( see fig .",
    "[ hi ] ) , @xcite found a hardness - intensity anti - correlation .",
    "the linear correlation coefficient of the data corresponds to a chance probalility smaller than 10@xmath24 of being due to uncorrelated data . in addition , according to an f - test , the data are significantly ( at a 5.2 @xmath25 level ) better described by a linear fit than by a constant value .",
    "we have verified that there is no correlation between the hardness ratios of the individual bursts and the off - axis angle at which they have been detected .",
    "in adition we have verified that the vignetting correction procedure used in @xcite is consistent with the values of the flux of the crab nebula measured in different positions in the field of view of ibis .",
    "persistent ( quiescent ) emission from has been discorvered at x - ray ( @xmath1810 kev ) energies @xcite . up to now no detection at higher energies has been reported for any of the sgrs .",
    "we have analyzed ibis , jem - x and spi data of the too ( 240 ksec ) , but we did not find convincing evidence of quiescent emission .",
    "on the other hand analyzing ibis / isgri core program data ( @xmath11 msec of exposure on ) , we detect the source at @xmath16 @xmath25 level in ibis / isgri ( see fig . [ isgri ] ) in the 20 - 40 kev band .",
    "the flux is @xmath13 mcrab , consistent with an extrapolation of the spectrum measured at lower energies @xcite .",
    "although a detection with such a relatively small significance is also compatible with background systematic noise in the significance maps , the positional coincidence with the x - ray counterpart strengthens the detection .",
    "also spi data have been searched for quiescent emission .",
    "482 pointings around the position of ( core program and too data ) have been used , yielding a total exposure of @xmath10.798 ms . for the spiros @xcite analysis tool",
    "the catalogue of the sources detected by ibis / isgri has been used as an input .",
    "a significance map was generated in the energy range between 28 and 48 kev .",
    "the measured flux is 0.69@xmath260.15@xmath910@xmath24 photons @xmath11 s@xmath4 .",
    "this flux ( @xmath1 10 mcrab ) is slighly higher than the one measured by ibis , but considering that the spi detection level is just @xmath1 4.4 @xmath25 , and that systematic errors are still present at this stage in the analysis of both instruments , we can consider the two results as consistent with each other .",
    "further gcde observations during integral ao-2 will surely help to further assess the detection and the source flux .    concerning jem - x core program data , the analysis has still to be completed and will surely be helpful in order to better asses the possible ibis and spi detection .",
    "the detection of pulsed emission is at the moment below our sensitivity .",
    "we can summarize our results as follows :    * for the first time good evidence for spectral evolution of weak sgr bursts is presented and a hardness - intensisty anti - correlation within the bursts has been found @xcite .",
    "this results represent a new challenge for the _ magnetar _ model , which predicts that the effetive temperature of the burst should vary weakly during the bursts , while we detect large spectral variations whitin the bursts as for number 9 and 22 .",
    "* we report for the first time the possible detection , in ibis and spi data , of the quiescent emission above 10 kev .",
    "* ibis is a very sensitive detector for sgr bursts , with fluences down to @xmath110@xmath10 erg @xmath11 in imaging mode .",
    "in fact in just 1.5 months it detected twice as many bursts from this source as batse during its whole lifetime @xcite . *",
    "the search of pulsed emission is at the moment below the sensitivity threshold for our data .",
    "* will be observed again during integral ao-2 allowing to study this source more deeply .",
    "we finally note that since january 2004 the integral burst alert system ( ibas ) is distributing alerts also for sgr bursts .",
    "two examples are a @xmath10.2 s long burst from detected at 10:24:08.35 ut on march 9 2004 @xcite and the @xmath10.5 s long faint burst detected at 13:02:06.33 ut on march 16 ( ibas alert n. 1677 ) .",
    "the alert messages have been distributed just @xmath120 seconds after the bursts , allowing for prompt follow - up observations at other wavelenghts .",
    "this feature will be particularly useful in case of major bursts like the ones from sgr 1900 + 14 or sgr 0526 - 66 .",
    "this work has been partially supported by the italian space agency ( asi ) .",
