    "the problem of boundary lubricated friction of two perfect sliding crystal surfaces is fascinating both from the fundamental point of view and for applications in the wider context of nanofriction.@xcite intriguing and unexpected behavior of the relative lubricant velocity have recently been reported in numerical simulations , depending on the `` degree '' of geometrical incommensurability defining the moving interface .",
    "the main nontrivial feature is the asymmetry in the sliding velocity of the intermediate lubricant sheet relative to the two substrates.@xcite .",
    "moreover , and even more strikingly , the lubricant mean velocity takes a constant , `` quantized '' , value uniquely determined by the incommensurability ratios of the three spatial periodicities involved  the two sliders and the interposed solid lubricant  and is insensitive to other physical parameters of the model .",
    "the sliding steady state versus overall sliding velocity , as well as other parameters , is characterized by perfectly flat plateaus in the ratio of the time - averaged lubricant center of mass ( c.m . ) velocity to the externally imposed relative speed @xmath1 of the two sliders .",
    "this amounts to a kind of `` dynamical incompressibility '' or dynamic pinning , namely , identically null velocity response to perturbations or fluctuations trying to deflect the relative lubricant velocity away from its quantized value .",
    "the occurrence of this surprising regime of motion was ascribed to the intrinsic topological nature of this locked dynamics .",
    "this phenomenon , investigated in detail in rather idealized one - dimensional ( 1d ) geometries @xcite , was explained by the grip exerted by one slider onto the topological solitons ( called kinks or antikinks in one - dimension ) that the embedded solid lubricant lattice forms with the other slider .",
    "the pinning of these solitons by the first slider causes their rigid dragging at the full sliding speed @xmath1 . as a result",
    "the overall mean lubricant speed is a fixed ratio @xmath2 of the slider s speed , strictly determined by the soliton spatial density , a purely geometrical factor @xmath3 .",
    "simulation evidence of this particular sliding regime was also confirmed for a less idealized 1 + 1-dimensional ( 1 + 1d ) model of boundary lubrication @xcite , where lennard - jones ( lj ) interacting atoms were allowed to move freely , parallel and perpendicularly to the sliding direction .",
    "solitons formed in this case too , and their influence transmitted from one slider to the other across the lubricant film even when the thickness is as large as six atomic layers .    in this work , we simulate lubricated sliding in a fully 3d prototypical model .",
    "we again find that , under fairly general conditions , the lubricant slides relative to a fixed surface with a mean relative lubricant velocity component in the driving direction @xmath4 , which is `` quantized '' to a basically parameter - independent value @xmath5 , much as was observed for the essentially 1d models .",
    "confirming its soliton nature here too , we characterize the properties and limitations of the quantized - velocity dynamics in the 3d model , showing that the quantized sliding is robust against wide - range variations of different model parameters .",
    "an intuitive and suggestive picture of the advancing solitons in the quantized state can be appreciated by the side view of the 3d geometry of fig .",
    "[ snap : fig ] .",
    "one can note the characteristic `` caterpillar '' motion executed by the lubricant particles in contact with the closest - matched crystal surface . in the 3d geometry",
    "actually the soliton ( moir ) pattern is a 2d feature , which in general implies additional characteristics , such as mismatches induced by relative lattice rotation @xcite . in this 3d study",
    "we will however restrict our investigation to mutually aligned incommensurate geometries , deferring the rotated cases to future work .",
    "we represent the two confining 3d crystal surfaces by perfectly periodic 2d ( @xmath6 ) monolayers , rigidly arranged in close - packed triangular lattices representing , e.g. the ( 111 ) face of a cubic crystal . between these two rigid planar sliders",
    "we insert @xmath7 layers of generally crystallized but mobile lubricant atoms , see fig .",
    "[ snap : fig ] .",
    "each layer is composed of point - like classical particles of unit mass ( @xmath8 ) . while the reciprocal intra - layer positions of top and bottom slider atoms are of course fixed , the atoms composing the lubricant film move freely under the action of pairwise ( 6,12 ) lj interactions among one another and with the rigid atoms forming the top and the bottom surfaces .",
    "the standard lj interaction @xmath9 \\,,\\ ] ] is characterized by depth @xmath10 and radius @xmath11 .",
    "we truncate the interaction at a cutoff radius @xmath12 and shift the 2-body potential energy to eliminate the energy discontinuity as follows : @xmath13    the motion of the @xmath14-th lubricant particle is ruled by the equation of motion @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the position of the @xmath14-th lubricant particle ; @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the positions of the top and bottoms slider atoms , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the numbers of the bottom , lubricant and top particles , and @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the truncated 2-body potential energies for the interactions between bottom - lubricant , lubricant - lubricant and top - lubricant particles , respectively , characterized by generally different @xmath25 and @xmath26 parameters , as specified below . @xmath27 and @xmath28 are a damping force and a random force respectively , used to implement a langevin dynamics , as detailed below .    by convention , we select the bottom slider as our reference frame . the top slider is forced to move rigidly along @xmath29 at a fixed horizontal velocity @xmath30 , under an external downward force @xmath31 applied to each particle in the slider .",
    "it also generally moves along the @xmath32 and @xmath33 axes ( its inertia equals the total mass @xmath21 of its atoms ) under the interaction between its atoms and those of the lubricant film .",
    "for these @xmath34 and @xmath35 components , the motion of the top slider is described by @xmath36 where the components of the thermostat force @xmath37 are discussed below .",
    "as all equations for @xmath38 are the same , irrespective of @xmath39 , in practice their solution only differs by a translation @xmath40 ( where @xmath41 are the initial positions of the rigid top 2d lattice ) , so that equations for @xmath42 and @xmath43 only are integrated .      the total force needed to maintain the top slider at the fixed velocity @xmath1 compensates exactly the total force which the lubricant exerts on the top slider itself : @xmath44 the work of this frictional force @xmath45 represents the total joule heat that the advancing top layer pumps into the mechanical system over a time interval @xmath46 .",
    "to remove this joule heat , to reach a steady state , and to control the rise of lubricant temperature in this driven system , we use a standard implementation of the langevin dynamics , eq .  , including a phenomenological viscous damping term , plus a gaussian random force @xmath47 . to avoid biasing the lubricant motion by privileging either the bottom or the top reference frame , the damping force includes two contributions representing the energy dissipation into both sliders @xmath48 taking into account this twofold contribution to dissipation , the zero - average gaussian random forces satisfy @xmath49 ( with @xmath50 components ) , so that in a non - sliding regime ( @xmath51 ) the langevin thermostat leads to a stationary state characterized by standard boltzmann equilibrium average kinetic energy of the lubricant : @xmath52",
    "the damping force contribution representing the energy dissipation into the top slider requires a force balance ( newton s third law ) term in eqs .   and for the top layer : @xmath53 while the @xmath34 and @xmath35 components of this additional term have a real influence on the top motion through eqs .   and",
    ", of course its @xmath29 component does not .",
    "it only contributes to the external force @xmath54 required to maintain the top velocity @xmath29 component constant and equal to @xmath55 , with the last term in eq .  .",
    "as long as the value of @xmath56 is so small @xcite that it produces an underdamped dynamics , the thermostat perturbs the atomistic dynamics only marginally . under this condition ,",
    "the langevin method represents a simple but numerically stable and effective phenomenological approach to describe energy dissipation into the substrates occurring e.g. , through the excitation of phonons and ( in the case of metals ) of electron - hole pairs , etc .",
    "we verified that all qualitative results are insensitive to the value of @xmath56 ( as long as it is small enough ) , although quantitative issues such as the precise boundary of the quantized sliding regime do depend on @xmath56 .",
    "more refined methods were proposed and adopted in similar simulations @xcite but to investigate the occurrence and main properties of the quantized sliding phenomenon , a simple langevin approach to power dissipation is sufficient and appropriate .",
    "the sliding system involves three generally different solids , two sliders and a lubricant , which in their crystalline state are characterized by generally different lattice spacings : @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 . for the particle - particle interaction inside the lubricant",
    "we take the lj radius @xmath60 so as to compensate approximately first - neighbor repulsion with second- and third - neighbor attraction .",
    "interactions within each of the rigid sliders are of course not needed .",
    "however , one could still introduce them for convenience with radii @xmath61 and @xmath62 = @xmath63 , and fix slider - lubricant interaction radii @xmath64 and @xmath65 e.g.  by means of the lorentz - berthelot mixing rules @xcite : @xmath66 in practice however we fix the radii according to @xmath67 , and for simplicity , we fix the same interaction energy @xmath68 for all pairwise coupling terms , unless otherwise noted .",

    "typical physical values are also indicated . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we consider a set of `` natural '' units in terms of @xmath26 ( energy ) , @xmath63 ( length ) , and @xmath69 ( mass ) .",
    "all quantities are then expressed as dimensionless numbers . to obtain a physical quantity in its explicit dimensional form",
    ", one should multiply its simulated numerical value by the corresponding natural units listed in table  [ units : tab ] .",
    "the spacings @xmath58 , @xmath57 , and @xmath63 , and the angles of relative rotation , define the initial conditions for the sliders and the lubricant lattices .",
    "each atomic layer is initially a perfect 2d triangular lattice .",
    "we stack complete layers , realizing an fcc crystalline film of lubricant as it would be at low temperature .",
    "the initial vertical separation between successive lubricant layers is of the order of @xmath70 .",
    "the three different spacings @xmath58 , @xmath63 and @xmath57 give rise to two independent ratios affecting the 2d lattice mismatches : @xmath71    we perform the numerical integration of eqs .  , and by means of an adaptive fourth - order runge - kutta - fehlberg method , when @xmath72 , or , for finite @xmath73 , a 6-steps runge - kutta algorithm involving langevin random forces , eq .  .",
    "in order to explore with ease a large number of different configurations and to follow their evolution long enough for the top and lubricant to advance by several lattice spacings , our simulations involve a number of lubricant atoms @xmath74 , which is exceedingly small compared to those involved in a realistic sliding interface ( easily of the order of @xmath75 in a @xmath76m@xmath77 ) . to alleviate the effect of finite size and impose precise lattice - spacing ratios",

    "the lubricant is of course confined by top and bottom sliders . in the simple case in which the crystalline directions of the bottom , lubricant , and top lattices are parallel",
    ", it is straightforward to construct the appropriate supercell , whose side @xmath79 is an integer multiple ( e.g.  the smallest multiple ) of all three 2d lattice spacings , which have therefore to be taken mutually commensurate .",
    "for example , for @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , the smallest supercell is obtained by taking @xmath84 .",
    "the quantized velocity state was interpreted in 1d as the dynamical pinning of the periodic soliton pattern on the comparably long - wavelength corrugation potential produced by the top substrate @xcite .",
    "isomorphic to a static depinning transition ( the role of particles now taken by the moving kinks of the lubricant - substrate interface ) , although different in nature , this pinning should be particularly robust for perfect one - to - one commensurate matching of the inter - soliton spacing @xmath85 and the top - slider lattice spacing @xmath58,@xcite a condition where the soliton dragging should be especially effective in producing the quantized state .",
    "whenever the top lattice and the soliton pattern are aligned along the same crystalline directions , it makes sense to define a length ratio @xmath86 defining a `` coverage '' , and whose actual value depends on the spacing of solitons @xmath85 . the latter in turn",
    "is tuned by the geometric mismatch condition between the lubricant and bottom layers , as detailed in sect .",
    "[ qss : sec ] .    for most of the simulations described in the following",

    "a simulation will represent the steady dynamical state of the system provided ( i ) that the simulation time is much longer than the relaxation times of all quantities of interest and ( ii ) that it yields a sufficiently long sampling of fluctuations to obtain accurate time averages in the dynamical steady state . in all our calculations we discard an initial transient , extending usually for a comparably long time ( @xmath90 to @xmath91 time units ) , related to the poor damping produced by the relatively weakly coupled thermostat ( @xmath92 ) .",

    "we minimize systematic errors by evaluating these averages over one or several periods .",
    "when we run simulations with different @xmath1 , we set the total evolution time of each simulation @xmath93 by fixing the product @xmath94 , so that in a simulation the top slider advances by the same distance .",
    "we take at least @xmath95 length units for each simulation , and we also include a condition that @xmath93 never decreases under @xmath90 time units , which is usually sufficient because when @xmath1 is changed in small steps transients are shorter than the one illustrated in fig .  [",

    "we ran several batches of md simulations to characterize the properties and boundaries of this plateau of quantized - velocity dynamics in the 3d model .",
    "to evaluate the dragging of solitons and the ensuing velocity - quantization phenomenon in 3d , for each lubricant layer we need to compute the mean flux @xmath99 of lubricant particles crossing a line of length @xmath100 transverse to the pulling direction . by dividing @xmath99 by a hypothetical flux @xmath101 of lubricant particles all moving across the @xmath100 line at speed @xmath1 ,",

    "in contrast , for increasing @xmath1 , beyond a critical speed @xmath164 the quantized state is generally lost .",
    "the reason for the existence of such a maximum speed is that the quantized state is based on the forced advancement of a soliton deformation at speed @xmath1 along the lubricant crystal .",
    "as soon as @xmath1 is larger than the lubricant speed of sound , the amplitude of this soliton wave decays rapidly due to inertia , until it disappears together with the quantized state .",

    "we use sequences of linked md simulations to investigate the termination of the quantized - sliding state , as @xmath1 is changed in small steps .",
    "a similar study was carried out for the 1d frenkel - kontorova model @xcite and for the 1d and 2d analogous of the present sliding model @xcite , where a hysteretic termination of the plateau was identified in underdamped dynamics . as @xmath1",
    "is increased adiabatically , coming from the low - speed quantized state , there is a good chance that the ensuing sliding state remains quantized .",
    "this quantized sliding will therefore generate a plateau of constant @xmath168 , extending until a critical speed @xmath164 , where the pinning of solitons to the top slider corrugation loses its battle against the dissipative forces acting on the lubricant layer , represented by eq .  .",
    "for @xmath169 , a non - quantized state ensues , characterized by an irregular lubricant motion , and a center - mass speed fluctuating non periodically far from the quantized value @xmath170 . upon adiabatic decreasing @xmath1 from this high - speed non - quantized state , the quantized state is usually recovered at a speed lower than the depinning @xmath165 , a clearly hysteretic unpinning - pinning dynamical transition . in the intermediate range , the velocity ratio @xmath171 is therefore a multi - valued function of @xmath1 .",
    "figure  [ hysteresis : fig]a illustrates this hysteretic depinning for the fully - commensurate @xmath172 model of fig .",
    "[ modelsketch ] , with @xmath173 and @xmath72 .",
    "the precise value of @xmath174 is obtained by ramping @xmath1 up in small steps ; at every step the integration starts from the final configuration of the preceding step . for these model parameters ,",
    "we estimate @xmath175 .",
    "following the same procedure with downward steps to locate the speed of recovery of the quantized state , we obtain @xmath176 .",
    "the hysteretic loop is due to the `` dynamically metastable '' nature of the dynamically pinned state .",
    "the finite simulation time @xmath93 and the absence of thermal fluctuations ( @xmath177 ) can leave the system locked in a dynamically unfavorable state , which survives until the system jumps into the appropriate dynamically favored state .    the friction force reported in fig .",
    "[ hysteresis : fig]b , exhibits a nontrivial structure .",
    "around @xmath178 , 0.39 , 0.44 , 0.58 , and 0.82 , the friction force ( and consequently the dissipated power ) is seen to peak and then drop to a smaller value .",
    "these friction peaks arise at the resonances of the `` washboard '' frequency of the advancing lubricant crystal with the bottom lattice with specific vibrational normal modes of the lubricant lattice .",
    "the resonance are reflected by peaks in the lubricant internal kinetic energy , see fig .",
    "[ hysteresis : fig]c . across these resonant peaks ,",
    "the value of @xmath2 remains mostly stable , except at the last of these transitions , marking the end of the quantized plateau , with @xmath2 moving away from the @xmath140 value , again coinciding with a significant drop in friction . at resonant peaks rearrangements of the pinned configuration",
    "may occur , with the top layer displacing to grab and drag the soliton pattern to a different mutual arrangement , always guaranteeing the regular advancement of the solitons / antisolitons realizing the dynamically pinned state and the associated quantized velocity .",
    "a similar phenomenon is observed on the way back , decreasing @xmath55 : the friction force and the lubricant internal kinetic energy undergo several small jumps corresponding to washboard resonances related to the top - layer advancement over the non - quantized quasi - static state .",
    "corresponding to the resonances also @xmath179 has small bumps , until eventually the plateau state is recovered , with a sudden jump in the friction force .",
    "the hysteretic depinning regime observed in the present fully 3d model is therefore richer than that observed in the purely 1d model @xcite or in the 1 + 1d model of refs .  .",
    "if the ideal one - to - one geometrical interlocking between the top corrugation and the lubricant soliton pattern ( @xmath180 , i.e.  @xmath181 ) is of course an especially favorable condition for the occurrence of dynamical pinning , we do find velocity quantization even for @xmath182 , although not for all investigated values of @xmath89 . assuming that the previously unraveled 1d mapping to the frenkel - kontorova model @xcite is also meaningful in the present richer interface geometry , the coverage ratio should thus affect the robustness of the velocity plateau .",
    "indeed , simulations with simple integer ratios , such as @xmath162 and @xmath183 , do show quantized sliding essentially equivalent to the case with @xmath88 . other configurations with fractional @xmath89 , where the top - lattice crystal lines turn to be more pronouncedly out - of - registry with the lubricant soliton pattern , give rise to a weakening , or even the loss , of the quantized plateau .",
    "by following the quantized plateau up to its critical speed for several values of the mismatch ratio @xmath184 , ranging from solitonic ( @xmath185 ) to antisolitonic ( @xmath186 ) , we find a rather erratic dependence of @xmath165 on @xmath87 . in this case , the different degree of efficiency of the grip on solitons and thus of robustness of the quantized dynamics , may be partially related to random initial conditions , hardly a controllable element .      to investigate the robustness of the quantized state against thermal fluctuations , we run finite - temperature simulations in the same conditions as the zero - temperature runs discussed until now .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ temperature : fig ] .",
    "for low temperature @xmath187 and @xmath188 ( not shown ) , even though the trajectories of individual particles are affected by thermal fluctuations , @xmath2 exhibits no significant deviation from @xmath177 .    for larger",
    "@xmath189 and @xmath190 we observe deviations and fluctuations around the quantized plateau speed , see fig .",
    "[ temperature : fig ] .",
    "similar deviations were found in the 1 + 1d model @xcite .",
    "notice that these deviations in @xmath2 reflect very wide instantaneous fluctuations , often far exceeding the average lubricant velocity .",
    "the averaging over a finite simulation duration @xmath93 integrates out these large fluctuations , suggesting that , over an appropriately reduced range of @xmath1 , the system fluctuates around the quantized sliding state , which still dictates the average lubricant advancement speed .",
    "if longer simulations were carried out , further averaging would decrease the fluctuation amplitude , thus indicating that the thermal regime is indeed randomly fluctuating around the dynamically pinned state . in temperature",
    ", the dynamical depinning tends to occur at a generally smaller driving speed .    for even larger",
    "@xmath191 , the tendency to in - plane thermal expansion of the lubricant layer , frustrated by the in - plane pbc , resolves in the expulsion of a small fraction of atoms from the lubricant layer , which thus gets rid of the soliton - originating mismatch to the bottom layer . as a result ,",
    "the quantized sliding state is completely absent at such high temperature .",
    "we also investigate the effect of changing the load applied between the sliders , squeezing the lubricant layer among them . the lubricant in turn",
    "is not perfectly flat , because in - register regions are composed by hollow - site atoms , which move closer to the bottom slider , while the soliton regions consist of atoms occupying bridge or top sites , which are therefore pushed upward . in matched ( @xmath88 ) configurations and in the ensuing quantized sliding state ,",
    "the top slider atoms tend to catch over the in - register regions which are the most vertically depressed lubricant areas , rather than over the solitons , where the lubricant is sticking out locally . as a result ,",
    "the applied load squeezes down onto the in - register regions , and affects the solitonic regions more marginally .",
    "thus , the increased load should make it more difficult for the soliton pattern to unpin itself from the top - layer corrugation .    to investigate the load dependence of the quantized plateaus we consider several @xmath166 values , and for each of them we cycle @xmath1 up in small steps , as described in sect .",
    "[ drivingv : sec ] , to determine @xmath165 .",
    "we collect the resulting values of @xmath165 for varied load in fig .",
    "[ load : fig ] , which shows that , by increasing @xmath166 , @xmath165 generally rises , thus indicating that , as expected , the quantized state is extended under a larger load @xmath166 .",
    "( a )    ( b )    in boundary lubrication , the lubricant as a rule solidifies into a multiplicity of layers , whose thickness is gradually reduced by squeeze - out under pressure , until a single layer is just an extreme possibility .",
    "it is therefore important to verify whether the plateau dynamics is an exclusive prerogative of the single lubricant layer studied so far , or whether it will occur even for multilayer solid lubricant films  although of course with generally smaller and less robust plateaus .",
    "figure  [ 5layers : fig ] displays the typical arrangement of lubricant particles relative to the substrates in a lubricant multi - layer configuration .",
    "soliton deformation affect mostly the lubricant layer in direct contact with the bottom substrate .",
    "the atoms of the uppermost lubricant layer are spaced almost regularly , but the residual vertical displacements can be sufficient for the soliton pattern to ingrain in the top substrate .",
    "for multiple lubricant layers ( up to @xmath192 ) , we recover quantized velocity plateaus , for the case examined of full matching @xmath88 , with @xmath193 and @xmath177 .",
    "we evaluate the robustness of the quantized sliding state by determining the critical speed @xmath165 where the quantized plateau ends in this multilayer lubricant case .",
    "figure  [ multilayers : fig ] shows that the broadest plateau is achieved for @xmath194 .",
    "its width is still as large at @xmath195 ; further lubricant thickening reduces @xmath165 progressively .",
    "this decrease is not surprising , as the power - law weakening of soliton - induced corrugation across the film makes the grip on solitons by the top slider harder and harder for thicker and thicker layers . for @xmath196",
    ", we could detect no quantized - sliding dynamics , even at very small @xmath1 .",
    "we present a simulation study of the relative sliding of rigid incommensurate crystal surfaces separated by a 3d solid and fully mobile lubricant film , whose interatomic interactions were assumed to be of lj type .",
    "the `` quantization '' of the lubricant s sliding speed previously uncovered in much more idealized , lower dimensional models is fully confirmed in this more realistic case .",
    "the quantized relative speed plateau as a function of overall sliding speed is detected very clearly and demonstrated to extend over broad parameters ranges including applied load , number of lubricant layers and commensuration ratio between the top layer and the soliton lattice .",
    "focusing mainly on unrotated lattices and a single lubricant layer , we find perfect plateaus at the same geometrically determined velocity ratio @xmath140 as observed in the 1d and 2d models , both in case of solitons ( forward lubricant sliding ) and of antisolitons ( backward soliton sliding ) .",
    "we find that the soliton pinning to the top slider leading to plateau quantization is abandoned by increasing the sliding velocity @xmath1 above a critical value @xmath165 .",
    "it is eventually retrieved when @xmath1 is reduced back down to @xmath197 , thus with a hysteresis .",
    "the quantized sliding state is strengthened by an applied load .",
    "although the optimal rate of commensuration for quantization to occur is perfect 1:1 matching ( @xmath147 ) between soliton lattice and top slider lattice of kinks to the upper slider lattice , weaker but definite quantized regimes exist even for @xmath198 .    in the attempt to address slightly more realistic conditions",
    ", we also model a multilayer as opposed to monolayer lj solid lubricant ; and a monolayer and a bilayer of solid ar acting as a lubricant between a flat graphite surface and a nanopatterned slider .",
    "quantized sliding is recovered in both cases , although in a rather fragile form for @xmath199 .",
    "we see no reason for the same moir - pattern dragging mechanism to be restricted to lj systems : it is likely to show up in many sliding - friction experiments , as long as a crystalline lubricant thin film ( e.g.  a graphene layer ) is sandwiched in between two different lattice - mismatched crystalline sliders .",
    "the present preliminary investigation of thermal effects confirms the robustness of the quantized state . like for the 1 + 1d model of refs .",
    ", we find that ( i ) the quantized plateau becomes noisy , with the relative lubricant velocity @xmath2 fluctuating around @xmath140 , ( ii ) the dynamical depinning , rather than a sharp hysteretic transition , behaves as a continuous crossover , and ( iii ) this crossover occurs at a generally smaller speed @xmath1 .",
    "a further systematic investigation of thermal effects and of the mutual rotation of the three crystalline layers promises nontrivial developments .",
    "we acknowledge useful discussion with p. ballone and i.e. castelli .",
