    "the number of electronic equipments is increasing rapidly in automotive vehicles , aircrafts , and many other safety critical systems .",
    "consequently , the reliability of wired networks and electric connections is becoming more and more important .",
    "for example , in automotive industry , a goal is to develop compact and easy to use devices for the diagnosis of electric connection failures in garage or at the end of the production chain .",
    "these devices should be capable of detecting and locating failures in cables and in connectors .",
    "another goal is on - board diagnosis : the diagnosis device will be integrated to the vehicle in order to detect failures under normal working conditions of the vehicle . to find faulty wiring in such networks , it is not always possible to measure end - to - end cable impedances , because the number of available diagnostic port plugs is limited , and furthermore , for diagnosis purpose , it is not sufficient to detect a high end - to - end impedance as it is also necessary to locate the fault within the cable . in such situations time or frequency domain reflectometry ( tdr , fdr )",
    "are the most commonly used methods : a high frequency signal ( a short travelling pulse for tdr , a standing wave for fdr ) is sent down a wire at some point and the signal reflected by the network is measured at the same point and analyzed for fault detection and location  @xcite .",
    "automatic fault detection and diagnosis using reflectometry methods is the subject of intense research , both on the technologies of `` smart wiring systems '' and reflectometers  @xcite and on the foundations of the tdr / fdr methods .",
    "most studies are concerned with various aspects of mathematical modeling and simulation of microwave propagation in networks , from network complexity  @xcite to reduced order modeling of high frequency phenomena like skin effect  @xcite .",
    "the inverse problem of fault detection and localization for a network is in general studied in simulation or experimentally . for this problem",
    ", the available theory is developed mainly in the framework of inverse scattering theory limited to very simple networks ( segment , half - line , line ) ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the inverse scattering problem ( isp ) for a star - shape network @xmath0 of transmission lines .",
    "some of the branches of the network are extended in a direction @xmath1 to @xmath2 and the others admit a finite length .",
    "the network is assumed to be non - dissipative ; i.e. the series resistance @xmath3 and the shunt conductance @xmath4 per unit length are assumed to vanish and therefore , we are dealing with @xmath5-wires .    the main concern here is to derive some information concerning the topology and the geometry of the network , applying a very few scattering information . indeed , fixing an infinite branch @xmath6 ( see figure  [ fig : graph ] )",
    ", we generate a high - frequency time varying voltage at its infinite end and measuring the intensity at the same end , we would like to derive information such as the number of infinite branches @xmath7 and the wave travelling time @xmath8 of the finite segments @xmath9 .    here , in order to model our network , each branch is parameterized through its own length .",
    "the central node is assumed to be the zero ( origin ) of all the branches .",

    ", we provide the mathematical model consisting of the transmission line equations on each one of the network branches and the boundary conditions ( kirchhoff rules ) coupling these equations together .",
    "next , for the case of a simple transmission line , we provide a brief review of an old result by i. kay  @xcite , transforming the inverse scattering problem for one - dimensional nonuniform non dissipative transmission lines to the inverse scattering problem for a schrdinger operator .",
    "we extend this result to the case of our network by defining relevant boundary conditions .",
    "finally , we provide a result ensuring the essential self - adjointness of the schrdinger operator on the graph with the aforementioned boundary conditions .",
    "the existence of a unique self - adjoint extension allows us to start the study of the scattering theory and the scattering solutions .",
    "next , in section  [ sec : scat ] , we solve the scattering problem by providing the scattering solutions . in this aim , we apply the jost solutions on semi - infinite branches  @xcite and the fundamental solutions on the finite segments  @xcite .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : asy ] , we study the asymptotic behavior of the reflection coefficient in the limit of high - frequency waves and we prove how this limit provides us the needed information on the topology and the geometry of the graph .",
    "in the absence of dissipation , the transmission line equations writes @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively denote the intensity of the current and the voltage at time @xmath27 and position @xmath1 of a finite or infinite branch .",
    "let us index these functions as @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , defined on the branches @xmath32 .    at the central node ,",

    "i.e. for @xmath37 the equation   becomes @xmath38 applying the liouville transforation @xmath39 and the conventions @xmath40 , @xmath41 , etc , and setting @xmath42^{\\frac{1}{4}}u(k , x)\\ ] ] the equation   writes @xmath43 here , the potential @xmath44 is defined as follows : @xmath45^{-\\frac{1}{4}}\\frac{d^{2}}{dx^{2}}\\left [ \\frac{c(x)}{l(x)}\\right]^{\\frac{1}{4}}.\\ ] ] note that , the new coordinate @xmath46 here has the dimension of time .",

    "in particular the length @xmath47 of a finite transmission line is transformed into the correspoindg wave travelling time : @xmath48      the @xmath5-transmission line equations defined on each edge for @xmath49 are equivalent to the schrdinger equations @xmath50 in this new formalism , the boundary condition   writes @xmath51 here , applying the assumptions of the section  [ sec : intro ] , the functions @xmath52^{\\frac{1}{4}},\\qquad j\\in\\{1,\\cdots , n+m\\}\\ ] ] are well defined , strictly positive and regular .",

    ", we only need to show that at a node connecting @xmath65 edges , we have @xmath65 linearly independent linear boundary conditions . at the terminal edges of @xmath66",
    "this is trivially the case as there is one branch and one boundary condition . at the central edge",
    "it is not hard to verify that   and   define such boundary conditions as well .",
    "this implies that the operator @xmath56 is essentially self - adjoint and therefore that it admits a unique self - adjoint extension .",
    "we are now ready to start the study of the scattering solutions .",
    "we are interested in the scattering solution where a signal of frequency @xmath36 is applied at one end of one of the infinite branches .",
    "in fact , in general , one might be interested in a experiment where signals of different amplitudes @xmath67 are applied at all ends of the infinite branches .",
    "in such a case , we will be seeking a scattering solution satisfying the asymptotic behavior at @xmath68 @xmath69 however , the experiment we consider here corresponds to the simple case @xmath70 the main result of this section , may be expressed as follows :    [ thm : scattering ] there exists a unique solution @xmath71 of the scattering problem , satisfying    * @xmath72 ; * @xmath73 satisfy the boundary conditions   and  ; * for each @xmath74 , there exist @xmath75 and @xmath76 such that @xmath77    the coefficients , @xmath75 and @xmath78 , in   and   appear to be unique .",
    "they are called respectively the reflection and the transmission coefficients .",
    "we proceed the proof of the theorem  [ thm : scattering ] by constructing such a solution and by showing that such a construction is unique .    in this aim , we apply two different types of solutions : 1- the so - called jost solutions on half - lines  @xcite and 2- the fundamental solution of the one - end sturm - liouville equation  @xcite .      the jost solutions @xmath79 and @xmath80 on the half line @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is a potential defined on @xmath81 , are the solutions of the schrdinger integral equations @xmath83 under the decay assumption a4 on @xmath82 , these volterra type integral equations admit unique solutions .",
    "in fact , one only needs to apply the standard iterative methods for the proof of existence and uniqueness of solutions to volterra type integral equations ( see e.g.  @xcite , pages 138 - 139 , for a proof ) .",
    "the fundamental solution , @xmath89 , is a solution of the schrdinger equation , @xmath90 where @xmath91 denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath46 .",
    "this solution may be expressed through the following integral representation  @xcite , @xmath92 here the kernel @xmath93 is a solution of the following integral equation @xmath94 where we have extended the potential @xmath82 to be zero outside the interval of its definition .",
    "the integral equation   admits a unique solution ( cf .",
    "@xcite , theorem  1.2.2 ) .",
    "applying the same result , for a potential @xmath82 in @xmath95 , this solution satisfies @xmath96 furthermore , simple computations imply@xmath97and@xmath98where @xmath99 and @xmath100 denote respectively the derivatives with respect to the first and the second coordinates @xmath46 and @xmath27 . for a potential @xmath101 , this together with   implies @xmath102      for this construction , we distinguish between three types of edges .",
    "define @xmath103 note that @xmath104 and therefore , at least for @xmath36 large enough , @xmath105 is non - zero and @xmath106 is well - defined .",
    "furthermore , note that @xmath106 satisfies the schrdinger equation @xmath107 and through the requirement   and by  , at @xmath108 @xmath109 consider now the wronskian @xmath110 where the derivatives are taken with respect to the position @xmath111 .",
    "it is not a hard task to verify that the above wronskian is a constant function of @xmath111 .",

    "applying   together with the definition of the fundamental solution  , we have @xmath133 and therefore , just as in above there exists a constant @xmath134 such that @xmath135 at this point , we can apply the boundary conditions at the centeral node  , in order to find the @xmath136 constants @xmath75 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
