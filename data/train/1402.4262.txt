    "the flocking of animals @xcite relies on organisms sensing each other s presence , orientation and direction of movement .",
    "physical scientists interested in this spontaneous breaking of rotation invariance in living systems have adopted a variety of approaches to the problem @xcite , including experiments in vivo and in vitro @xcite , computer simulations and theory .",
    "artificial analogues of self - propulsion @xcite are currently a subject of intense interest , both as a controlled testing ground for theoretical predictions and as a rich source of new phenomena and applications .",
    "we focus here on the case of macroscopic particles with a stepwise tapered rod - like shape , with inelasticity and static friction , placed on a rapidly vibrating surface .",
    "the tilt of the particle takes up the vibrational energy and , through a frictional mechanism already described elsewhere @xcite , transduces it into directed motion along the surface .",
    "it is proper to regard such particles as self - propelling : the sustained energy input from the vibrating surface is nutrient or fuel , the tilt of the particle is the motor coordinate , the direction of motion is set by the particle orientation , not by an external force , and the net in - plane force on particle plus base is zero .",
    "the motility mechanism can be viewed as a noisy ratchet @xcite with the novelty that the asymmetry is carried not by the substrate but by the particle , as in @xcite .",
    "a single such motile rod on a bare vibrated surface translates , with mean speed 0.36 cm s@xmath0 and standard deviation 0.25 cm s@xmath0 , where the statistics is obtained from 150 rods , primarily in the direction of the vector from its thick end to its thin end . that vector itself executes rotational diffusion , losing memory of its initial orientation on long enough time scales . as a result ,",
    "the centre of mass of the rod describes a persistent two - dimensional random walk in the plane of the surface on which it lies .",
    "anisotropy is crucial : spheres , lacking a distinguished axis , can not tilt and thus can not achieve _ motility _ , i.e. , _",
    "self_-propulsion , by means of the mechanism that animates the rods .",
    "a sphere can move laterally only if pushed or dragged by the motile rods ; an isolated sphere on a vibrating surface simply bounces in place @xcite .",
    "the movements of a single motile rod amidst a sea of spherical beads were shown earlier @xcite to display some remarkable statistical properties as a consequence of the obstacles to rod motion presented by the beads . in the present work",
    "we look for novel interaction effects , structural or dynamical in origin , in the collective behaviour of motile rods dispersed amongst spherical beads .",
    "our curiosity is amply rewarded : we find that the rods self - organise into a globally oriented moving state at remarkably low concentration provided the bead background is dense enough .",
    "a well - defined phase transition separates this ordered state or _",
    ", from the disordered isotropic phase .",
    "we create a detailed mechanistic simulation model of this system , which reproduces the phenomena observed and uncovers the underlying physical processes .",
    "we integrate the insights from experiment and simulation into a simple analytical theory whose predictions are borne out by our observations .",
    "our work demonstrates for the first time the formation of a true flock in a collection of dry grains .",
    "our discovery that a small concentration of motile particles can coherently transport a large passive cargo , with an efficiency that increases with the load , could find applications in granular flow .",
    "we speculate further that the mutual interaction of a small population of motile living organisms and a background of non - motile material could yield self - organisation of the former and enhanced transport of the latter .",
    "fig . [ flock0 ] shows a representative image of our granular flock . despite their low concentration the rod display a high degree of orientational order .",
    "this and further results emerge from our experiments on a mixture of stepwise tapered rods and spherical beads confined between surfaces subjected to rapid vertical vibration ( see fig .",
    "[ snapshot]a and methods ) .",
    "the system is initialised by introducing the beads into the sample cell and distributing the rods amidst the beads , to yield a homogeneous rod - bead monolayer .",
    "we then study the nature of the statistically stationary state of the vibrated rod - bead mixture as a function of the area fractions @xmath1 and @xmath2 , defined as the fraction of the surface covered by the two - dimensional projections of the beads and rods respectively .",
    "we monitor the centroid positions @xmath3 of all the particles and the tail - to - head unit vectors @xmath4 , where @xmath5 labels the particle in question , and all vectors lie in the horizontal plane .",
    "with increasing @xmath1 ( or , less surprisingly , @xmath2 ) the system is seen to undergo a phase transition from a disordered state to one in which the rod orientation vectors are aligned .",
    "correspondingly , the rods move in random directions in the low - density state ( fig .",
    "[ snapshot]b and supplementary movie 1 ) and coherently at high densities ( fig . [ snapshot]d and supplementary movie 2 ) . at long times",
    "the global movement in the ordered phase is a clockwise or anticlockwise circulation with equal probability ( supplementary fig .",
    "1 ) , with the orientation vectors aligned parallel to the boundary .",
    "the direction of circulation once selected does not change for the duration of the experiment .",
    "we have checked that neither crystalline order nor mechanical rigidity of the bead bed is an essential ingredient in promoting the flocking of the rods .",
    "for example , the flock in fig .",
    "[ flock0 ] is on a liquid - like bead background .",
    "further , rods in an amorphous bead bed , generated by using a mixture of bead sizes , are also seen to self - organise into a flock ( supplementary fig . 2 and supplementary note 1 ) . creating and maintaining a homogeneous state in bidisperse systems is complicated by size - segregation effects , which is why we have continued to work with beads of a single size .",
    "the rich physics that enters when the bead medium is a single- or multidomain crystal requires a separate study , now underway .    in a confined geometry the simplest flock consists of particles globally circulating around a common centre , which is the motion seen in our experiments .",
    "accordingly , we resolve @xmath4 into local polar - coordinate components @xmath6 , which we use to evaluate the order parameter @xmath7 distinguishing isotropic and oriented states , and @xmath8 , which measures correlations of orientational fluctuations about the mean for pairs @xmath9 of rods with separation @xmath10 .",
    "the instantaneous in - plane bead - velocity unit vectors @xmath11 , transformed to the local polar frame to give @xmath12 , provide another measure of flocking , @xmath13 .",
    "the averaging denoted by the angle brackets is carried out over all rods and over all times in the steady state for @xmath14 , about 100 statistically independent images for @xmath15 , and 25 frames for @xmath16 ( frame rate @xmath17 s@xmath0 , and the plate is vibrated at 200 hz ) .",
    "the disordered and ordered phases are most clearly distinguished by growth kinetics .",
    "[ snapshot]c shows a typical disordered state with magnitude of the instantaneous order parameter , averaged over rods but not over time @xmath18 @xmath19 fluctuating just above zero , and fig .",
    "[ snapshot]e presents an ordered state where @xmath20 grows and saturates to a value close to @xmath21 which implies that polar rods are now moving parallel to the boundary .",

    "[ pdgr]a . for @xmath23",
    "we find that @xmath22 increases abruptly across the line @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "we identify this line , provisionally , as the location of the nonequilibrium phase transition between the disordered and ordered states , bearing in mind the effects of finite size and the sample boundary . correspondingly , fig .",
    "[ pdgr]c shows the experimentally measured polar order parameter as a function of @xmath1 for @xmath26 . at the smallest values of @xmath2 the phase boundary bends sharply upwards , possibly implying a true lower limit to the @xmath2 required to produce a flock regardless of @xmath1 . at the highest densities arrested states",
    "are observed , where rods either jam against the particles of the bead medium or cluster along the boundary ( supplementary fig .",
    "[ pdgr]e reports the variation of the steady - state orientational correlations @xmath15 ( scaled by its value at the smallest @xmath27 ) of the rods as the system approaches and then crosses the phase boundary .",
    "for @xmath28 spatial correlations consistent with a power - law are seen , while for larger or smaller @xmath1 , safely within the ordered or the disordered phase , correlations decay more rapidly .",
    "these observations can consistently be interpreted as pretransitional fluctuations in the vicinity of a nonequilibrium phase transition , although the system sizes explored are too small to permit a claim about the order of the transition . as effects of finite size limit the accuracy of our estimates of the value of the order parameter and the location of the phase transition , we present in supplementary fig .",
    "4a the correlation functions of the orientation without the mean subtracted .",
    "the flocking of the polar rods is accompanied by coherent motion of the beads ( fig .",
    "[ mediumop]a ) as well , as measured by the bead - velocity order parameter @xmath16 , which shows the same growth kinetics as @xmath22 ( fig.[mediumop]b ) .",
    "in order to understand the physics underlying this novel realisation of a flocking transition , and to explore which of the many possible control parameters are essential , we create a computer model of tapered rods and spherical beads . for convenience in simulation",
    "the rods are constructed by joining overlapping spheres in a straight line [ fig .",
    "[ snapshot]f ] , but their shape is chosen to resemble as closely as possible the stepwise tapered rods in the experiment .",
    "we have also tried other shapes such as a uniform taper and find qualitatively similar results which we do not present here .",
    "we carry out two types of studies , one in an enclosure constructed to imitate the experimental geometry , the other with periodic boundary conditions in the horizontal plane . in both cases the simulations , like the experiments , are three - dimensional , with a base and a lid permitting tightly confined motion in the third dimension .",
    "the energy input , precisely as in the experiment , is through vertical agitation of the container .",
    "the particles move according to the laws of newtonian mechanics",
    ". collisions of the particles with each other and with the bounding surfaces are governed by inelasticity and static coulomb friction .",
    "we add a small rotational noise to the dynamics of individual rods .",
    "this improves the fidelity of our imitation of the experimental system , in which minute imperfections in particle shape and base or lid topography endow each rod with rotational diffusion even when no beads or other rods are present .",
    "our simulation results can be seen in figs .",

    "the numerical experiment , moreover , can be performed in a periodic simulation box , eliminating the effects of sample boundaries .",
    "[ snapshot]k & l ( supplementary movie 5 ) and [ snapshot]m & n ( supplementary movie 6 ) show that the order parameter , now measured in a global cartesian frame , remains at values consistent with zero for all times at low @xmath1 , while at high @xmath1 it grows to saturation .",

    "as in the experiments , we present the `` unsubtracted '' correlation functions in supplementary fig .",
    "4b . for good measure",
    ", we also investigate and rule out , in supplementary fig .",
    "6 ( and supplementary note 2 ) , the possibility that the only role played by the beads is to reduce the rotational diffusion of rods .",
    "these simulation results establish beyond reasonable doubt that the phenomenon we observe is a phase transition , with the beads playing a direct role in mediating an aligning interaction amongst the rods .",
    "lastly , on theoretical grounds , in particular because the suspending medium of beads is compressible @xcite , we expect large number fluctuations in our system as in standard flocking models of the toner - tu type @xcite . in such systems ,",
    "large - scale correlated particle currents arise as a result of the coupling to easily excited and slowly decaying variations in the orientation field , both in the ordered phase @xcite and in the isotropic phase near onset @xcite . in methods",
    "we show that the separate conservation of rods and beads leaves unaltered the arguments @xcite for anomalously large number fluctuations .",
    "we have carried out a limited set of numerical studies of fluctuations in the number density of rods in the ordered and disordered phases , and find an excess in both cases ( fig .",
    "[ denfluc ] ) .",
    "our simulation measurements of the standard deviation @xmath31 in the number of polar rods in regions containing @xmath32 particles on average show that @xmath33 grows with @xmath32 .",
    "however , more extensive simulations or experiments are required for a useful fit to a power law or other dependence on @xmath32 , and to probe the relation of this phenomenon to known sources @xcite of enhanced density fluctuations in active systems .",
    "we now integrate the insights gained from experiment and simulation to construct a theory .",
    "the sequence of events in fig .",
    "[ notouch ] also seen in simulation studies , shows that coherently moving polar rods are able to entrain a stray rod initially moving in the opposite direction , through the bead flow they generate , as seen in supplementary movies 2 , 4 and 6 .",
    "these observations suggest that the coupling of flow and orientation lies at the heart of the phenomenon of flocking at a distance , as we now show through a minimal , universal hydrodynamic theory whose parameters and their dependence on @xmath1 we measure in our simulation .",
    "we also discuss the connection to the particular case of bricard _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "as we are concerned with large - scale ordering , we work with coarse - grained fields .",
    "our system is a suspension of polar rods in a _",
    "compressible _ two - dimensional fluid of beads on a substrate .",
    "the variables of interest are therefore the local order parameter @xmath34 , given by the average of the orientation vectors @xmath35 of the polar rods , and the number densities @xmath36 and @xmath37 of beads and rods respectively , in a small neighbourhood around point @xmath38 at time @xmath18 .",
    "below , for simplicity , we consider the limit of small rod concentration , and so treat only the bead density @xmath39 .",
    "a treatment with both densities is in methods .",
    "in addition , we include @xmath40 , the average bead - velocity vector in the neighbourhood , as it plays a crucial role in mediating the interactions that lead to order . in the dilute - rod limit @xmath16",
    "can be viewed as the total velocity field of both species .",
    "the equations of motion follow from a few general principles and some key elements of the dynamics of the system .",
    "conservation of particles is embodied in the continuity equation [ conteq ] _",
    "t + ( ) = 0 .",
    "newton s second law locally reads [ momeq ] _ t * v * = -(- ^2)*v * + - b + ... where we present only the leading - order terms in an expansion in powers of gradients and fields . in , @xmath41 damps motion with respect to the substrate and lid , the term in @xmath42 can be viewed as describing pressure forces , driving flow downhill in density for @xmath43 , and @xmath44 measures the degree to which orientation of the polar rods gives rise to propulsive flow .",
    "we note in passing here that such a term was argued to arise @xcite in the two - dimensional projection of the three - dimensional hydrodynamics of a suspension of motile organisms confined to a thin layer of fluid .",
    "we discuss below the somewhat different origin of the term in the case of our monolayer system .",
    "the viscosity @xmath45 describes transmission of momentum in the plane of the system .",
    "the local order parameter @xmath14 , again to leading order in gradients and fields , obeys [ peq ] _",
    "t * p * = - ( a - k ^2)*p * - a + ... where @xmath46 measures the rate at which an initial polarisation relaxes , presumably through rotational diffusion , and the magnitude and sign of @xmath47 characterise the tendency of rods to orient parallel or antiparallel to concentration gradients @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath48 determines the rate at which a uniform velocity ( with respect to the confining walls ) aligns the polarisation .",
    "the parameter @xmath49 governs spatial variations in the direction and magnitude of the order parameter .",
    "the ellipsis in and denotes contributions @xcite at higher orders in @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , discussed in methods .    the terms with coefficients @xmath44 and @xmath48 are the key players in and .",
    "no symmetry rules out their existence ; a phenomenological theory must therefore include them .",
    "however , the physics underlying these terms , especially as regards their _ signs _ , merits some discussion . recall that @xmath35 for the @xmath5th rod points from the thick to the thin end . depending on the detailed contact mechanics with the vibrating base ,",
    "the rod could propel itself on average parallel or antiparallel to @xmath35 .",
    "friction would cause the bead medium in the vicinity to be dragged in the direction of motion of the rod .",
    "a collection of such rods thus generates a force proportional to the mean polarisation @xmath14 .",
    "the parameter @xmath44 measures the strength of this forcing .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath44 should grow with the mean rod concentration and propulsion speed , and should further depend on the surface characteristics of a rod which influence its ability to carry the ambient medium with it , by dragging or pushing . a rod with spontaneous motion parallel ( antiparallel ) to @xmath35",
    "has @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) . by suitably engineering the geometry , mass distribution , surface properties and contact mechanics of a rod , and exploring a range of vibration parameters , it should be possible to make polar rods with a range of magnitudes and either sign of @xmath44 ; the rods we work with here have @xmath53 .",
    "the mechanics underlying @xmath48 is reminiscent of the interaction of wind with a weathercock .",
    "imagine a single tapered rod lying athwart a uniform flow of particles over a surface .",
    "although the momentum transfer is distributed uniformly across the rod , its mass is concentrated , and hence its pivot point shifted , towards one end .",
    "this leads to a net torque due to the flow , and a consequent rotation as shown in fig .",
    "[ parameters]a .",
    "geometrical arguments alone can not determine the sign of @xmath48 and hence the sense of rotation , and self - propelling activity could influence its value .",
    "it should be possible to engineer @xmath55 by using intrinsically higher - density material at the thin end , or a hollow interior at the thick end .",
    "the availability of a numerical simulation model provides independent measurements of all phenomenological parameters of importance to our theory . to measure @xmath48",
    ", we place a single polar rod initially pointing in the @xmath56 direction , and impose a flow of beads with velocity @xmath16 in the @xmath57 direction ( see supplementary movie 7 ) . by measuring the initial growth rate",
    "we estimate the parameter @xmath48 in , which we average over 50 such trials . independently , by measuring the rotational relaxation of a single rod , we infer @xmath46 . in a separate simulation , we impose a nonzero mean @xmath14 by applying an orienting field on a collection of rods . measuring the saturation value of the resulting macroscopic velocity yields",
    "@xmath58 in .",
    "the damping @xmath59 is readily estimated from the relaxation of an imposed initial velocity .",
    "[ parameters]b shows the dependence of these key parameters on area fraction @xmath60 .",
    "we comment in methods on the parameter @xmath47 , which plays only a minor role in our analysis .",
    "we ignore density variations in ( [ peq ] ) and ( [ momeq ] ) , replacing @xmath36 by its mean value @xmath60 which we treat as a parameter on which the coefficients depend . working with the spatial fourier components @xmath61 and @xmath62 of the velocity and order parameter at wavevector @xmath63 , ( [ momeq ] ) then tells us that , on time scales long compared to @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "substituting this value for @xmath16 in ( [ peq ] ) we obtain , to order @xmath66 , [ peqeff ] _ t * p * = - ( |a + |kq^2)*p * where @xmath67 and @xmath68 . the mechanism for spontaneous ordering now becomes clear . as @xmath48 is an increasing function of @xmath60 , @xmath69 can turn negative even if @xmath46 is positive .",
    "the state @xmath70 is then linearly unstable , and a state with nonzero @xmath14 on macroscopic scales will set in .",
    "let us now test our theory using our simulation measurements of the parameters .",
    "first , for the proposed mechanism to work , @xmath69 must be less than @xmath46 , i.e. , we predict @xmath71 .",
    "our simulations show that a rod drags beads in the direction of its own motion and that the flow of beads rotates neighbouring rods to point in , and thus move in , the direction of the flow .",
    "thus @xmath44 and @xmath48 have the same sign , confirming the prediction . secondly , fig .",
    "[ parameters]b shows that as @xmath72 is increased , @xmath58 ( for three values of @xmath2 ) increases and @xmath73 decreases , and the two quantities cross ( i.e. , @xmath69 crosses zero ) at a value of @xmath72 which decreases with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "therefore the theory predicts a phase transition to an ordered phase with increasing area fraction , and negative slope to the phase boundary in the @xmath2-@xmath1 plane , both of which are borne out by experiment .",
    "the intersection points in fig .",
    "[ parameters]b , corresponding to the mean - field estimate of the threshold area fraction , are , not surprisingly , somewhat lower than the measured values in the simulation , fig .",
    "[ pdgr]b .    within our mean - field treatment [ ( [ peqeff ] ) or the parent equations ( [ peq ] ) and ( [ momeq ] ) ] it is straightforward to see that the transition has a continuous onset and a diverging correlation length @xmath74 .",
    "our limited observations in experiment and simulation show an increasing correlation length upon approach to the transition .",
    "experience with standard flocking models would suggest @xcite instead a discontinuous transition , albeit with appreciable pretransitional fluctuations .",
    "larger - scale simulation studies including finite - size scaling analyses , now in progress , will determine the character and spatial structure of the onset of order for our rod - bead flock .",
    "note that orientability , motility and coupling to flow , rather than specifics of shape , were the essential ingredients of our theory . on symmetry grounds one can not therefore rule out the possibility that the self - propelled disks of @xcite , in a background of non - motile particles , could flock through the mechanism reported here ",
    "provided flow can reorient the disks in the manner required .",
    "our work is of importance as a remarkable example of cooperativity in active matter , with rods and beads giving rise to order that the former could not achieve at such low concentration and the latter could not aspire to at all .",
    "it suggests an original mechanism for creating a coherent motile composite by introducing a small number of orientable motile particles into a medium containing non - motile components , that transmit motion more effectively as their concentration is increased .",
    "a static image of the ordered state would give no clue to why the rods are lining up : the transmission of orientational information takes place through a viscous interaction which can be tuned through concentration .",
    "this works because our system is a monolayer , not a confined three - dimensional fluid .",
    "momentum transfer in the vertical direction is governed by friction with the bounding base and lid .",
    "only the transmission of momentum laterally in the plane of the system is governed by an effective viscosity arising from tangential forces between the beads with each other and with the rods .",
    "our simulations show that in - plane viscous effects , as measured by @xmath44 or @xmath45 in ( [ momeq ] ) , are enhanced by increasing bead concentration , while the out - of - plane damping @xmath59 stays constant .",
    "it is this key feature that gives us a system in which the flocking tendency can be tuned by varying the concentration of the non - motile actors , the beads .",
    "empirically , the system displays a flocking transition even if the bead medium is so concentrated that it crystallises .",
    "our simplified theory is restricted to the case where the system as a whole is fluid , not crystalline .",
    "how motile rods move through , and transmit their motion and orientation through , a highly ordered bead medium , remains a major open problem .",
    "the hydrodynamic theory we have presented is indifferent to the precise origin of motility .",
    "it matters only that a polar , motile object drags ambient inert particles , whose flow in turn reorients neighbouring polar particles .",
    "there is a priori no reason why this can not be realised in a system in which the motility mechanism does not required mechanical vibration or , for that matter , a vertical electric field as in @xcite .",
    "could living matter take advantage of such a general mechanism ?",
    "the reader should note that the flocking behaviour seen in our system was not inevitable , but relied on favourable signs of the parameters @xmath44 ( rods drag beads ) and @xmath48 ( the weathercock effect ) .",
    "an important direction that we are currently exploring is to design polar rods with the `` wrong '' relative sign of @xmath44 and @xmath48 .",
    "indeed all the parameters @xmath75 and @xmath46 can be manipulated at the scale of a single particle .",
    "increasing rotational noise , perhaps by roughening particle surfaces or increasing the vibration amplitude , should increase @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath59 could be changed by roughening the base and lid .",
    "the tendency of a polar rod to point along the flow is quantified by @xmath48 . the shape and the mass distribution of the rod are the likely properties governing this parameter .",
    "it seems to us that there are two mechanisms behind the term @xmath76 in : dragging by tangential forces at the sides of a rod , and the pushing of beads at the head of a rod .",
    "a detailed exploration of the effects of shape and surface friction would allows us to manipulate @xmath44 .",
    "much remains to be explored about this granular flock .",
    "deep in the ordered phase , the character of excitations about the uniform aligned state awaits study , as do the statistics of density and orientational fluctuations . just past the apparent onset of order ,",
    "does our system reproduce the banding instability of simple flocks , and is the character of this granular flocking phase transition discontinuous @xcite ?",
    "what is the nature of the competition between kinetic arrest and flocking as concentrations are increased ?    before closing , we return to the colloidal flock of bricard _",
    "@xcite , in which energy from a vertical electric field is transduced into rolling motion in a horizontal plane . in that system",
    "too , hydrodynamic coupling leads to a macroscopically aligned state of particle velocities .",
    "the most important distinguishing feature of our system is that the aligning interaction between the motile polar rods can be tuned by changing the concentration of the beads , which are themselves non - motile .",
    "furthermore , the suspending medium , namely , the fluid of beads , is compressible ( effects associated with overall incompressibility of grains plus air should arise in an airtight container . ) , which rules out the suppression of fluctuations found by bricard _",
    "_ @xcite ; the rods carry an intrinsic shape polarity ; the single - rod motility is not hydrodynamic in origin ; the hydrodynamics at all scales in our monolayer system is that of a two - dimensional fluid on a dissipative substrate @xcite ; the flow field around a single polar rod ( supplementary fig . 7 and supplementary note 3 ) is simply a screened monopole @xcite .    to summarise : we have created a system of macroscopic motile dry grains that flock spontaneously at low concentration , transmitting information about their orientation over large distances through the flow of an ambient medium of millimetre - sized beads .",
    "the beads , themselves non - motile , are cargo and coupling : increasing their number promotes flocking and enhances their own coherent transport .",
