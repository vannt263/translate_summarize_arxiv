    "complex iridium oxides recently emerged as a novel playground for correlated electron physics where strong spin - orbit coupling of 5@xmath5 ir , comparable to its modest coulomb @xmath6 , plays a critical role to produce unprecedented electronic phases .",
    "a notable example is the spin - orbital mott state with local @xmath7 = 1/2 wave function produced by the interplay between spin - orbit coupling and coulomb @xmath6 .",

    "the magnetic exchange takes the form of an anisotropic bond - dependent interaction .",
    "such bond - dependent coupling gives rise to strong frustration when iridium ions are placed on a tri - coordinated motif like honeycomb lattice , invoking a possible route for kitaev spin liquid @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for 180@xmath13 bond of ir - o - ir , relevant to sr@xmath2iro@xmath3 , the magnetic coupling is proposed to comprise isotropic heisenberg exchange and pseudodipolar interaction stemming from hund s coupling .",
    "the emergence of isotropic heisenberg coupling , rooted in the isotropic @xmath7 = 1/2 wave function , is rather unexpected since spin - orbit coupling is generally considered to produce magnetic anisotropy .",

    "in contrast to the previous data measured at a relatively high field of 0.5 t @xcite , @xmath31 shows a clear decrease with cooling below 200 k. this is consistent with the uudd stacking of canting moments in the ground state @xcite , where the net moments are zero .",
    "the bifurcation seen well below @xmath4 likely represents the uncompensated canting moments due to the pinning to crystalline defects such as stacking faults along the @xmath18-axis .",
    "we believe that the competition of very weak nearest and next - nearest interlayer couplings , as will be discussed below , is one of the origins for such pronounced pinning effect .",

    "the reduced slope at the zero field limit mirrors the suppressed in - plane susceptibility below 200 k in the temperature dependent susceptibility . measuring the magnetization above @xmath33 gives rise to a weakly ferromagnetic behavior as reported previously @xcite .",

    "the possible origin of this discrepancy is the reduced magnitude of isospin moments at high temperatures .",
