    "soft @xmath2-ray repeaters ( sgrs ; see @xcite for a recent observational review ) are sources both of bursts of hard x - rays/@xmath2-rays and softer quiescent x - ray emission .",
    "they are generally thought to be young ( @xmath13  yr ) neutron stars with extremely strong magnetic fields , or magnetars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this belief was motivated by the energetics of their bursts @xcite , their associations with young supernova remnants ( snrs ; @xcite ) , and the detection of x - ray pulsations with long ( 510  s ) periods and large ( @xmath14 ) spin - down rates @xcite .",
    "however , more recent observational evidence @xcite has shown that in most cases the sgr / snr associations are false and can be attributed to random chance @xcite . instead of being constrained by the snr associations ,",
    "the small ages of the sgrs are now limited by the proximity of the sgrs to sites of very massive star formation @xcite .    an alternate theory , first proposed @xcite for the emission from the related anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ; see @xcite ) , and",
    "now for the sgrs as well ( @xcite ; but see @xcite ) , is accretion from a `` fallback '' disk of material produced during the supernova explosion onto a central neutron star . in this model",
    ", the neutron stars are spinning near the equilibrium period which is proportional to the dipole field strength .",
    "this model then explains the spin - down and period clustering of the axps : for a typical field strength of @xmath15  g , the resultant spin period is @xmath16  s.    to date , no confirmed persistent counterparts have been found for sgrs at optical / ir or radio wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although @xcite may have found an infrared counterpart to sgr  1806@xmath1220 .",
    "it generally has been the case that when counterparts are identified at other wavelengths , especially optical or ir , there is considerable progress in our understanding of these objects .",
    "for example , the identification of an optical / ir counterpart of the axp 4u  0142 + 61 @xcite has posed the strongest challenge to accretion models . in view of this , it is important to press upon sensitive multi - wavelength observations of sgrs .",
    "here we present optical , ir , and radio observations of the very accurately localized sgr  1900@xmath314(@xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "sgr  1900@xmath314  had been a relatively innocuous source until late 1998 .",

    "august  27 , the spacecraft konus detected an intense burst of @xmath2-rays @xcite .",
    "arrival - time localization @xcite soon identified sgr  1900@xmath314  as the source .",
    "prompt radio observations detected a fading , non - thermal source @xcite coincident with the x - ray source @xcite , and timing of the x - ray emission revealed a 5.16-s pulsar @xcite with magnetar - like spin - down @xcite .",
    "the radio source associated with the 1998  august  27 burst is located at @xmath17 , @xmath18 , with uncertainty @xmath19 in each coordinate @xcite .",
    "searches for sgr  1900@xmath314  at wavelengths other than x - ray and @xmath2-ray have not detected any quiescent counterpart @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite did detect a young ( @xmath20  yr old ) radio pulsar ( psr  j1907@xmath30918 ) located in the vicinity0918  is located at @xmath21 , @xmath22 , with uncertainty @xmath23 in each coordinate @xcite .",
    "] of both sgr  1900@xmath314  and g042.8@xmath300.6 , suggesting that g042.8@xmath300.6  could be associated with psr  j1907@xmath30918  just as easily as with sgr  1900@xmath314 .",
    "@xcite have suggested that sgr  1900@xmath314  is somehow related to a compact cluster found in its vicinity ( about @xmath24 away ) .",
    "a similar cluster has been identified near sgr  1806@xmath1220 @xcite .",
    "we note , though , that no such cluster is found in the vicinity of sgr  0526 - 66 in the _ hst _ images presented by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , sgr  1806@xmath1220 and sgr  1900@xmath314  are found at low galactic latitudes in the inner galaxy and the chance coincidence probability with star clusters , the rare luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) and snrs is not negligible ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". indeed , there is now significant doubt about the association of sgr  1806@xmath1220 with the snr g10.0@xmath120.3 @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the presence of star clusters in the vicinity of sgr  1900@xmath314  appears intriguing , but while our radio maps are deeper than previous images ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we find no radio source or nebulae associated with this star cluster ( see figures  [ fig : l][fig : p - wide ] ) .    for the x - ray properties of sgr  1900@xmath314  in what follows",
    ", we use the power - law @xmath3 blackbody fit to the second epoch ( the one closer to normal quiescence ) of the recent _ chandra _ observations by @xcite : @xmath25 , power - law index @xmath26 , blackbody temperature @xmath27  kev , and an un - absorbed 0.510  kev x - ray flux @xmath28 ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "this is consistent with the _ asca _ measurements of @xcite .",

    "the hydrogen column density implies a visual extinction @xmath30  mag , assuming @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "these values differ significantly from those assumed for the star cluster ( @xmath3215  kpc , @xmath33  mag ; @xcite ) , and this difference may make the case for associating sgr  1900@xmath314  and the cluster less compelling .",
    "we have carried out a campaign at optical / ir and radio wavelengths to detect sgr  1900@xmath314 .",
    "the radio data can also determine the existence of a low surface - brightness nebula surrounding sgr  1900@xmath314 , and localize sgr  1900@xmath314relative to nearby snrs .",
    "see table  [ tab_obs ] for a log of all the observations .",
    "the optical data consist of 5 exposures taken by the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) aboard the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) , totaling 5195  s. the data were taken in imaging mode using the clear ( 50ccd ) filter , giving a bandpass centered at roughly @xmath34  nm and a full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath35  nm .",
    "the first exposure had a duration of 30  s , and was used for astrometry ( see below ) .",

    "we followed the standard drizzling reduction procedure @xcite expanding the individual pixels by a factor of two .",
    "this drizzling changed the pixel scale from @xmath37 to @xmath38 .",

    "* ) on the keck telescope .",
    "for the 54 stars that were not overexposed , we measured centroids and corrected for instrumental distortion using a bi - cubic function determined by j.  cohen ( 1997 , private communication ) .",
    "we used these to solve for the zero - points in each coordinate , the plate scale , and the position angle on the sky . after rejecting 8 outliers ( residual larger than @xmath40 ) , the root - mean - square residuals were @xmath41 in each coordinate",
    "this is somewhat larger than we found for other projects , but not atypical for relatively crowded galactic fields on the northern hemisphere . given this , the astrometry is tied to the usno - a2.0 system at the @xmath42 level . the typical accuracy with which the usno - a2.0 catalogue is on the international celestial reference frame ( icrf ) is about @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the astrometry was transferred to the stis image using 43 stars close to the radio position , solving again for plate scale , rotation and zero - points .",

    "the data were reduced with custom iraf software .",
    "the images were dark subtracted , flat - fielded , and corrected for bad pixels and cosmic rays .",

    "the phase calibrator was jvas  j1925 + 2106 , and the flux calibrator was 3c  48 .",
    "the data were then self - calibrated and combined for imaging .",

    "the rms noise is @xmath63 , largely due to confusion from unresolved sources in the galactic plane ; see figure  [ fig : l - tap ] .",
    "the 332  mhz data were taken at the vla in spectral - line mode with 32 channels of 97  khz each to aid in the excision of radio - frequency interference ( rfi ) .",
    "we reduced the observations in aips , following the procedure for low - frequency data reduction ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "then we phase ( using 3c  380 ) and gain ( using 3c  286 and 3c  48 ) calibrated the fringe visibilities .",
    "we again searched for and removed rfi , then averaged the channels together .",
    "we mapped and self - calibrated the data iteratively , using 3-dimensional fourier transforms in imagr , the basic aips deconvolution and imaging task .",
    "while imaging we used 25 planar facets arranged in a @xmath64 grid , each of which had @xmath65 @xmath66 cells .",
    "these facets were used to mitigate the effects of non - coplanar arrays that are present at low frequencies and with wide fields @xcite .",
    "finally , we re - assembled the facets and flattened them into a single planar map using the task flatn .",
    "the rms noise is @xmath67 , limited primarily by confusion due to unresolved emission in the galactic plane and to sidelobes from the bright w49 complex .",
    "the final beam size is @xmath68 , comparable to that of the tapered 1.4-ghz images ; see figures  [ fig : p - wide ] and [ fig : p - zoom ] .",
    "for the infrared and optical observations the astrometric uncertainty is @xmath45 . combined with the @xmath69 uncertainty from @xcite ,",
    "this gives us a 99% confidence radius of @xmath70 .",
    "we examined all sources in or near a circle of this radius around the position of @xcite . in the deepest observation , the @xmath1-band image ,",
    "we detect 7 sources that we label a ",
    "g on figures  [ fig : stis ] and [ fig : nirc ] ( only sources a  d are visible in figure  [ fig : stis ] ) . of these",
    ", c and d are significantly blended on all the images , as are sources c and g. sources e , f , and g are too faint to measure on the stis image , and sources e and f are too faint to measure on the @xmath0-band image .",
    "because of the degree of blending , we used a point - spread function ( psf ) fitting and subtraction technique to perform photometry on the infrared data , using the daophot package .",
    "first we measured the psf s of a number ( @xmath71 ) of stars in the field without close neighbors , and constructed an average psf for each image .",
    "we then fit this psf to each source in figures  [ fig : stis ] and [ fig : nirc ] , subtracted the fitted stellar profile from the images , and used the subtracted images to fit the sources that were hidden by the original source .",
    "after iterating this procedure , we were able to obtain consistent magnitudes for most of the sources .",
    "for the sources that we were able to fit , all had sizes consistent with unresolved sources . for the stis data , we adjusted the measured magnitudes to a nominal infinite aperture with a @xmath72  mag correction , based on the observed stis psf .",
    "we present the positions and magnitudes of sources a ",
    "g in table  [ tab : stars ] .    in figure",
    "[ fig : cc ] , we show a color - color diagram for the sources in table  [ tab : stars ] and 37 field stars for which we were able to perform reasonably accurate photometry in all bands .",
    "the sources from table  [ tab : stars ] all lie in the region populated by the other sources . in figure",
    "[ fig : cc ] we also show model main - sequence colors ( based on * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for @xmath7310  mag .",
    "these fit the majority of the points , with the exception of source d. however , since source d was blended with source c ( making the ir photometry less reliable ) and it is still in the region of the color - color diagram populated by other stars ( some of whom were slightly blended themselves ) , we consider it unlikely that d has significantly non - stellar colors , and therefore is probably not a counterpart to sgr  1900@xmath314  ( both the disk models for axps [ @xcite ] and the optical / ir detection of an axp [ @xcite ] have non - stellar colors , and we expect something similar for sgrs ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : hr ] we show color - magnitude diagrams for the sources in table  [ tab : stars ] and 37 field stars .",
    "again , the sources populate the same region ( although the field stars were chosen to be somewhat brighter than the faintest of the candidate sources ) , and are well bounded by model main sequences with @xmath74  kpc and @xmath7310  mag .",
    "source d , in particular , has slightly strange colors ( also as seen in figure  [ fig : cc ] ) but its magnitudes are well within the range of the main sequence . main sequences with @xmath3215  kpc and @xmath75  mag , such as those plotted in @xcite , are too faint and too red to match these sources .",
    "therefore the sources in table  [ tab : stars ] are likely to be in the foreground of the cluster found by @xcite .",
    "source g in figures  [ fig : stis ] and [ fig : nirc ] and in table  [ tab : stars ] is too faint for accurate photometry given its proximity to other sources .",
    "it could be a counterpart of sgr  1900@xmath314 , and we require additional deep , high - resolution infrared imaging to settle this issue .",
    "regardless , it is near our detection limit , so we can place general upper limits to the emission from sgr  1900@xmath314  of @xmath76  mag , @xmath77  mag , and @xmath78  mag , consistent with previously published limits @xcite .",
    "we show these limits along with the _ cxo _  x - ray spectrum @xcite in figure  [ fig : nufnu ] .",
    "these limits translate into unabsorbed ( `` u '' ) x - ray - to - infrared flux ratios @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( assuming @xmath81  mag ) .",
    "this last limit is only a factor of @xmath82 less than the detected x - ray - to-@xmath1 limit found for the axp 4u  0142@xmath361 ( f.  hulleman 2001 , personal communication ; see figure  [ fig : nufnu ] ) and thus we can exclude the basic disk model for axp / sgr emission ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) . if a disk does exist , then it must be truncated at @xmath83  cm . as seen for sgr  0526@xmath1266 @xcite",
    ", the optical / ir limits require that the x - ray power - law break between the x - ray and the optical bands , but allow for a continuation of the x - ray blackbody .",
    "we were able to detect but not photometer many luminous members of the massive star cluster that @xcite proposed as the origin of sgr  1900@xmath314 , as we only had a small number of exposures where the central m giant stars were unsaturated . in the remaining exposures these stars were too saturated to allow good psf subtraction , and their scattered light , bleed trails , and readout trails prevent accurate measurement of the stars in the cluster .",
    "we do not detect either sgr  1900@xmath314  or psr  j1907@xmath30918  in the radio images .",
    "we therefore have 3-@xmath4 limits on point source emission of 6  mjy ( 332  mhz ) and 1.5  mjy ( 1.4  ghz ) .",
    "we also have 3-@xmath4 limits on extended emission of @xmath84 ( 332  mhz ) and @xmath85 ( 1.4  ghz ) .",
    "we were able to detect snrs g042.8@xmath300.6 , g043.3@xmath1200.2 , g041.1@xmath1200.3 , and possibly g043.9@xmath1201.6 at 332  mhz ( figure  [ fig : p - wide ] ) .",
    "however , g041.1@xmath1200.3 , g043.3@xmath1200.2 , and g043.9@xmath1201.6 are too attenuated by the primary beam of the vla antennas for the flux measurements to be useful . for g042.8@xmath300.6",
    ", we measure @xmath86  jy , excluding the contributions of point sources ( see figure  [ fig : p - zoom ] ) , but we are likely missing some flux on the shortest baselines so this flux may be underestimated by 5%10% .",
    "the 332-mhz image ( figure  [ fig : p - wide ] ) shows three sources besides the known snrs that have shell - like morphologies but are in neither the current version of the galactic snr catalog @xcite nor any online database .",
    "we consider these sources to be candidate snrs , but with only limited data at other wavelengths we are unable to confirm an snr classification for any of the three .",
    "the sources could be regions or other similar sources and require additional confirmation .",
    "here we present what limited information we have on each .",
    "the first source is g043.5@xmath300.6  ( see figure  [ fig : snr ] ) .",
    "its center is at position @xmath87 , @xmath88 .",
    "it is circular , with radius @xmath89 .",
    "the total flux at 332  mhz is @xmath90  jy ( excluding the point source to the south - east ) , with an average surface brightness of @xmath91 .",
    "the edge appears to be brighter , with typical surface brightness of 68@xmath92 , while the interior is more typically 13@xmath92 .    without a measurement at another frequency ,",
    "it is hard to determine the properties of g043.5@xmath300.6 .",
    "we were not able to find any archival x - ray or radio data at this position that could definitively classify g043.5@xmath300.6 .",
    "however , there is a marginal detection in the 1.4-ghz nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; * ? ? ?",
    "the source is present in the nvss with the same general morphology although it is too faint to accurately measure a flux .",
    "this faintness , though , suggests that g043.5@xmath300.6  is not a thermal source , as it would have a nvss flux of @xmath93  jy and would then be easily detectable .",
    "there are two x - ray sources from the _ exosat _ medium - energy slew survey catalog @xcite that lie in or near g043.5@xmath300.6 : exms  b1906 + 095 and exms  b1906 + 094 .",
    "both sources had been associated with the x - ray binary 4u  1907 + 097 , which is within their @xmath94 position uncertainties , but the positions of the _ exosat _ sources are closer to g043.5@xmath300.6  than to 4u  1907 + 097 @xcite .",
    "it is therefore conceivable that the _ exosat _ sources are associated with regions of g043.5@xmath300.6 , but we require additional x - ray imaging to confirm this .",
    "we can estimate the distance to g043.5@xmath300.6  very roughly using the updated @xmath95-@xmath96 relation @xcite . assuming a spectral index @xmath97 , appropriate for many shell - type snrs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we find @xmath98 , which implies a linear diameter @xmath99  pc and distance @xmath100  kpc .",
    "we note that these numbers are extremely imprecise ( given both intrinsic uncertainties in the @xmath95-@xmath96 relation and in estimates of the 1-ghz surface brightness ) probably having errors approaching 100% .",
    "however , this value is consistent with g043.5@xmath300.6  being near the tangent point of spiral arm 3 of the @xcite electron density model .    also intriguing",
    "are the objects in figure  [ fig : p - wide ] marked g042.0@xmath1200.1 and g041.5 + 00.4 ( see figure  [ fig : p - hii ] ) .",
    "these objects have morphologies that are less well - determined than that of g043.5@xmath300.6  and are further out in the vla primary beam , so we can not make very useful measurements , but their shapes are suggestive of either snrs or regions",

    "the protruding region to the south - east of g042.0@xmath1200.1 was identified as an region on the basis of radio recombination lines by @xcite , but their data do not mention the rest of the complex and their angular resolution should be able to distinguish between the center of g042.0@xmath1200.1 and the smaller region .",
    "g042.0@xmath1200.1 is present in the nvss with similar morphology to the 332-mhz image and flux @xmath105  jy , suggesting a non - thermal spectrum and leading to a provisional classification as an snr .    g041.5 + 00.4 is centered at @xmath106 , @xmath107 .",
    "it has a complicated morphology , with a brightened rim to the north - east and a compact core to the south - west ( @xmath108 , @xmath109 ) , suggestive of a pulsar wind nebula .",
    "the source has an overall radius of @xmath110 and a 332-mhz flux of @xmath111  jy ( again , this is a highly uncertain value ) .",
    "comparison of the overall 332-mhz flux with the nvss flux of @xmath112  jy leads to a flat spectrum like that of core - dominated snr or an region .",
