    "correlated electrons on ladder lattices have been extensively investigated in the last two decades  @xcite , but relatively little attention has been paid to asymmetric ladders with two inequivalent legs . the one - dimensional ( 1d ) kondo - heisenberg model is the most studied asymmetric ladder system . it was used to investigate exotic superconducting correlations in stripe - ordered high - temperature superconductors @xcite as well as quantum phase transitions in heavy - fermion materials @xcite .",
    "additionally , a two - band hubbard model on a ladder lattice was the starting point of an investigation of pairing mechanisms in strongly repulsive fermion systems  @xcite .    in a different context",
    ", asymmetric ladder systems have been proposed as models for linear atomic wires deposited on the surface of a substrate  @xcite . in that case",
    ", one leg represents the wire while the second leg mimics those degrees of freedom of the substrate that couple to the wire .",
    "the study of such models provides a first approximation for the influence of the substrate on hallmarks of 1d physics such as the peierls instability  @xcite and the luttinger liquid @xcite .",
    "however , this approach has not been pursued systematically until now .",
    "1d electron systems have been studied extensively for more than 60 years  @xcite .",
    "well - established theories predict various anomalous properties of strictly 1d electron systems such as the peierls instability  @xcite , incommensurate charge and spin - density waves  @xcite , the dynamical separation of spin and charge excitations , and the luttinger liquid behavior of 1d conductors  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , quasi-1d electron systems have been realized in strongly anisotropic bulk materials such as bechgaard salts  @xcite and @xmath0conjugated polymers  @xcite .",
    "experimental and theoretical investigations have both demonstrated that even a weak coupling between 1d electron systems can play an essential role for their physical properties  @xcite .",
    "more recently , quasi-1d electron systems have been realized in atomic wires deposited on the surface of a semiconducting substrate  @xcite .",
    "for instance , it has been claimed that a peierls metal - insulator transition occurs in indium chains on a silicon substrate  @xcite and that luttinger liquid behavior is found in gold chains on a germanium substrate  @xcite .",
    "however , these claims remain controversial .",
    "a fundamental issue is that we have a poor theoretical knowledge of the influence of the coupling between wire and substrate . as investigations of interacting electrons on three - dimensional lattices with complex geometries",
    "are extremely difficult , the modeling of wire - substrate systems by much simpler asymmetric ladders  @xcite appears very promising .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a two - leg ladder system made of two inequivalent legs ; one is an interacting electron system described by the 1d hubbard model with on - site interaction @xmath1 and hopping integral @xmath2 , the other is a 1d electron gas ( fermi gas ) described by a tight - binding model with the same @xmath2 .",
    "the legs are coupled by an interchain ( or rung ) hopping @xmath3 .",
    "this is the simplest model of a correlated atomic wire coupled to a noninteracting substrate .",
    "it can also be seen as a special case of the general two - band hubbard model used to investigate pairing mechanisms @xcite .",
    "the model is further related to the kondo - heisenberg model  @xcite because the hubbard chain at half - filling has the same low - energy spin excitations as a heisenberg chain .",
    "thus , the asymmetric hubbard ladder can be seen as a generalization of the kondo - heisenberg model ( which corresponds to a mott insulator with infinitely large charge gap on the interacting leg ) to the case of a mott insulator with a finite gap for charge excitations .    here , we investigate the model properties for various values of the interaction @xmath1 and the rung hopping @xmath3 in a half - filled ladder , as well as at low doping away from half - filling .",
    "ground - state properties , excitation gaps , and spectral functions are determined accurately using the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) technique  @xcite and quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations  @xcite . furthermore , approximate analytical methods ( perturbation theory and mean - field approximation )",
    "are used to facilitate the interpretation of the numerical results .",
    "we find that the physics of the half - filled asymmetric ladder is very rich , with similarities to the kondo - heisenberg model  @xcite and the half - filled symmetric hubbard ladder  @xcite ( corresponding to a ladder with two identical legs ) in certain parameter regimes .",
    "furthermore , our results confirm that our model is a good starting point to investigate an atomic wire deposited on a substrate , but also reveal the limitations of representing the substrate by a single chain .",

    "the interchain hopping term @xmath3 transfers electrons from one chain to the other and hence creates excitations with energy larger than @xmath73 .",
    "consequently , for @xmath74 , a perturbative treatment is possible but merely yields corrections to the eigenenergies because the ground state is not degenerate .",
    "however , we expect the interplay of the hubbard interaction and the interchain hopping to induce effective interactions for the electrons in the fermi leg , as observed for the strong - interaction limit ( see sec .  [",

    "the effects of these effective interactions are not known _ a priori _ but , since a hubbard chain at half - filling has the same low - energy spin correlations as a heisenberg chain , we expect the low - energy physics of the weakly coupled chains to be similar to the kondo - heisenberg model with an effective rung exchange coupling @xmath75",

    "[ fig11](g ) and ( h ) , the lowest excitations have wave number @xmath267 for particle removal and @xmath268 for particle addition , respectively",
    ". the spectra are almost identical on the two legs .",
    "this agrees with the analysis of the weak - interaction limit in sec .",
    "[ sec : weak ] [ compare with fig .",
    "[ fig02](a ) ] and the dimer limit in sec .",
    "[ sec : dimer ] . indeed ,",
    "when @xmath3 is large enough , elementary excitations become almost ( anti-)symmetric with respect to a reflection in the rung direction .",
    "obviously , this case is very similar to a half - filled symmetric hubbard ladder with a strong rung hopping .    the markedly distinct spectral functions in fig .  [ fig11 ]",
    "confirm the existence of one metallic and three different gapped phases in the asymmetric hubbard ladder at half - filling .",
    "the phases can be characterized by the wave numbers of the low - energy excitations , in agreement with the analysis of limiting cases , the hartree - fock approximation , and the dmrg density profiles .",
    "in this work , we studied the rich physics of the half - filled asymmetric ladder model  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "in particular , we found three gapped phases that differ in the shape of their single - particle excitation spectra , in addition to a luttinger liquid phase . for strong hubbard interaction @xmath1 or weak",
    "interchain hopping @xmath3 , our model is related to the kondo - heisenberg model , whereas for weak hubbard repulsion @xmath1 or strong rung hopping @xmath3 , it is similar to that of a half - filled symmetric hubbard ladder .",
    "although we do not have enough data to draw a quantitative phase diagram , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] a schematic and tentative phase diagram that summarizes our findings .",
    "surprisingly , the overall structure is similar to the hartree - fock `` phase diagram '' in fig .",
    "[ fig06 ] including , in particular , the wave numbers of the lowest single - particle excitations .",
    "the main differences are the presence of a luttinger liquid phase at small interchain hopping and the absence of long - range antiferromagnetic order .",
    "the three gapped phases are not differentiated by a symmetry breaking or a gap closing but only by a change of the wave number of the low - energy excitations .",
    "similar transitions between phases with commensurate and incommensurate low - energy excitations were found previously in other models , such as the bilinear - biquadratic spin-1 chain  @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to determine phase boundaries numerically for phase transitions that do not involve any symmetry breaking or gap closing . in recent years",
    ", various measures of entanglement have been proposed as useful tools for the study of quantum phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "we examined one of them , the block entropy in the middle of the lattice , using the dmrg method .",
    "although we observed a different scaling of this entropy with block size in the gapless phase compared to the gapped ones , we did not found any feature which could help locate the boundaries between the three gapped phases .",
    "nevertheless , it is likely that dmrg calculations combined with one of the more sophisticated entanglement - based methods could provide a more precise phase diagram .",
    "the existence of a luttinger liquid phase has been demonstrated within the accuracy of our numerical methods .",
    "it should be kept in mind , however , that exponentially small energy scales usually associated with kondo physics are not accessible with these methods .",
    "therefore , we can not rigorously exclude the existence of other phases with exponentially small gaps in the limit of very small interchain hopping .",
    "we think that the best approach to solve this issue , and more generally to improve our understanding of the asymmetric hubbard ladder , is a more systematic investigation of the limiting cases in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] .",
    "on the one hand , effective models for the low - energy physics can be derived in the strong - interaction @xmath269 and dimer @xmath270 limits .",
    "they should be more amenable to our numerical methods and simple analytical approximations and could thus provide us with a better understanding of the upper and right - hand - side parts of the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] . on the other hand , it is likely that field - theoretical methods for weakly - coupled chains ( see sec .  [ sec : chains ] ) and weakly - interacting ladders ( sec .",
    "[ sec : weak ] ) could be used to investigate the left - hand and lower parts of the phase diagram .",
    "this study was motivated by the problem of correlated quantum wires deposited on a substrate . in this context",
    ", our results confirm that 1d correlated systems are extremely sensitive to their environment .",
    "their properties can be drastically modified by varying the strength of the hybridization ( the hopping @xmath3 ) between the interacting wire ( the hubbard leg ) and the noninteracting substrate ( the fermi leg ) . in that perspective",
    ", the study of asymmetric ladder models constitutes a useful approach for exploring the basic physics of a quantum wire deposited on a substrate .",
    "yet we also face some problems with this approach . clearly , it is not enough to represent the substrate by a single chain because the wire interaction can then dominate the full system as our results show .",
    "instead , the substrate should include many more explicit degrees of freedom than the wire .",
    "this could be realized using wider ladders with several legs representing the substrate .",
    "indeed , it is possible to map the hamiltonian of some wire - substrate systems exactly onto ladder models with an infinite number of inequivalent legs .",
    "( a similar idea has been recently used to map multiple multi - orbital impurities on a honeycomb lattice onto effective multi - leg ladder systems  @xcite . ) an effective ladder model with @xmath271 legs can then be seen as the `` @xmath272-th order '' approximation of the substrate degrees of freedom .",
    "we think that this approach could enable a more systematic study of wire - substrate systems in the future .",
    "in addition , in most experiments , the substrate is a band insulator .",
    "this condition can be easily realized using two or more orbitals per site but this will double the number of model parameters ( at least ) .",
    "this reveals the most serious practical difficulty : we do not know which parameter regime is appropriate for real systems such as atomic wires deposited on substrates .",
    "therefore , ladder models can not currently be used to study specific materials but can only provide generic information about the physics of quasi-1d electron systems .",
    "however , we think that systematic studies of effective @xmath272-leg ladder models could enable the determination of appropriate model parameters by comparison with experiments and first - principles simulations for wire - substrate systems .",
