    "the models with large extra dimensions involving 3-dimensional singular space - like surfaces with non - factorizable geometry , braneworlds @xcite , have attracted a lot of interest recently ( see @xcite for reviews ) . a key requirement for realizing",
    "the braneworld idea is that the various matter fields be localized on the brane .",
    "it is preferable to have a universal gravitational trapping mechanism for all fields .",
    "however , there are difficulties to realize such mechanism with the exponentially warp factor used in standard brane scenarios . in the existing ( 1 + 4)-dimensional models spin @xmath0 and spin @xmath1 fields are localized on the brane with the decreasing warp factor @xcite , spin @xmath2 field can be localized with the increasing warp factor @xcite , and spin @xmath3 fields are not localized at all @xcite . for the case of ( 1 + 5)-dimensions it was found that spin @xmath0 , spin @xmath3 and spin @xmath1 fields are localized on the brane with the decreasing warp factor and spin @xmath2 fields again are localized with the increasing warp factor @xcite .",
    "there exist also 6d models with non - exponential warp factors that provide gravitational localization of all kind of bulk fields on the brane @xcite , however , these models require introduction of unnatural sources .    to solve the localization and some other problems of the braneworlds with static geometric configurations there have appeared models which use time - dependent metrics @xcite .",
    "one such approach is proposed recently the standing wave braneworld model with gravi - scalar waves in the bulk @xcite .",
    "this kind of models can provide a natural alternative mechanism for universal gravitational trapping of zero modes of all kinds of matter fields .    to clarify the mechanism of localization used in standing waves",
    "braneworlds let us remind that standing electromagnetic waves , so - called optical lattices , can provide trapping of various particles by scattering , dipole and quadruple forces @xcite .",
    "it is known that the motion of test particles in the field of a gravitational wave is similar to the motion of charged particles in the field of an electromagnetic wave @xcite . thus standing gravitational waves",
    "could also lead to confinement of matter ( via quadruple forces ) .",
    "for example , the equations of motion of a system of spinless particles in the quadruple approximation has the form @xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the momentum and @xmath6 is the quadruple moment of the stress - energy tensor of the matter .",
    "the oscillating metric due to gravitational waves should induce a quadruple moment in the matter fields .",
    "if the induced quadruple moment is out of phase with the gravitational wave the system energy increases and the particles will feel a quadruple force , @xmath7 , which ejects them out of the high curvature region towards the nodes of standing waves .",

    "the standing waves solutions of the einstein equations are done by the oscillating metric function , @xmath387 where @xmath71 is the frequency of the waves and @xmath72 is some function depended on the extended extra dimension @xmath34 .",
    "the function ( [ v ] ) enters the equations of matter fields via exponentials : @xmath388 where @xmath28 is some constant . if @xmath71 is much larger than frequencies associated with energies of particles on the brane one can perform time averaging of oscillating exponents in the equations of matter fields . from the mathematical expression : @xmath389^m dt = \\left \\ { \\begin{array } { lr } 0 & ( m = 2n + 1)\\\\ \\frac { 2^{-m}m ! } { \\left [ ( m/2 ) ! \\right]^2 } & ( m = 2n ) \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] it follows the simple formula for the time averages of ( [ e - br ] ) @xcite : @xmath390 where @xmath173 is the modified bessel function of the zero order . to simplify equations of various matter fields on the brane within a standing wave braneworld model",
