    "singly ionized titanium is unique among the small number of atomic species whose interstellar absorption features can be observed from the ground , in that its ionization potential is nearly coincident with that of neutral hydrogen ",
    "so that is a dominant ion in regions , with negligible contributions from ionized ( ) gas . the column density ratio @xmath2()/@xmath2(h@xmath3 )  where h@xmath3 includes both neutral atomic and molecular hydrogen  thus gives a direct measure of the gas phase interstellar abundance of titanium .",
    "in principle , it is also fairly straightforward to obtain accurate column densities for .",
    "several lines of , with a range in strength , are available between 3060 and 3390    so that any effects of saturation in the strongest line at 3383   may be estimated .",
    "blending with stellar absorption features is not an issue for spectral types earlier than about b7 ( hobbs 1984 ) .",
    "the earliest surveys of absorption in the relatively nearby galactic ism indicated that even the @xmath73383 line is often fairly weak , and that the gas phase titanium abundance is significantly sub - solar in most sight lines ( wallerstein & goldsmith 1974 ; stokes 1978 ) .",
    "most of the titanium in the galactic ism appears to be depleted into dust grains , with less than 1 percent of the total ( assumed solar ) titanium in the gas in many sight lines .",
    "the @xmath2()/@xmath2(h@xmath3 ) ratio thus appears to be an excellent indicator of the overall level of depletion in a given line of sight  at least in the local galactic ism ( e.g. , jenkins 2004 , 2009 ) .",
    "because the lines are both weak ( typically ) and located in the near - uv , most subsequent surveys of interstellar have been undertaken at moderate spectral resolution ( 36 km  s@xmath1 ) toward relatively bright and generally lightly reddened background target stars ( albert 1983 ; albert et al . 1993 ; welsh et al .",
    "1997 ) ; some more reddened targets are included in the recent survey by hunter et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "comparisons of the absorption - line profiles and column densities of with those of and and examination of correlations with distance ( to the target stars ) have suggested that is distributed more similarly to , with both species primarily tracing the warmer , more smoothly distributed , more diffuse neutral component of the ism ( edgar & savage 1989 ; crinklaw , federman , & joseph 1994 ) .",
    "overall , the ratio @xmath2()/@xmath2 ( ) appears to be relatively constant , with a value of 0.30.4 ( albert 1983 ; hunter et al .",
    "2006 ) , even though both ti and ca can exhibit wide variations in depletion and even though can be either a dominant or a trace species in predominantly neutral regions .",
    "the distributions of both and are characterized by scale heights greater than 1000 pc perpendicular to the galactic disc  significantly larger than the roughly 200 pc scale height of ( albert 1983 ; edgar & savage 1989 ; albert et al .",
    "1993 ; albert , welsh , & danly 1994 ; lipman & pettini 1995 ) .",
    "titanium is thus less severely depleted , by a factor of order 4 , in the low galactic halo at 250 pc @xmath8 @xmath9z@xmath9 @xmath8 1000 pc , and is further enhanced in the gas phase in components at higher lsr velocities ( albert 1983 ) .    given the potential utility of as a depletion indicator , observations of have been employed in recent studies ranging from attempts to understand variations in the d / h ratio in the local ism to interpretations of the gas phase abundances in qso absorption - line systems .",
    "one possible explanation for the local variations in d / h is that deuterium could be preferentially depleted into dust grains ( jura 1982 ; tielens 1983 ; draine 2006 ) , in which case one would expect correlations between d / h and the depletions of various refractory elements , such as ti ( prochaska , tripp , & howk 2005 ; ellison , prochaska , & lopez 2007 ; lallement , hbrard , & welsh 2008 ) or si and fe ( linsky et al .",
    "while there does appear to be a correlation between the titanium depletion @xmath10(ti ) and d / h , the correlation is not as strong and the slope of the relationship is not as steep as might have been expected from the analogous relations seen for @xmath10(si ) and @xmath10(fe ) ( ellison et al .",
    "2007 ) . component - to - component differences between the depletions of ti and d ( prochaska et al . 2005 ) may be a factor .",
    "the gas phase abundances found for qso absorption - line systems must reflect both the nucleosynthetic history of the absorbers ( e.g. , the relative contributions of type i and type ii supernovae in enriching the ism ) and any ( selective ) depletion of various elements into dust  but disentangling the effects of those two factors is often difficult ( e.g. , lauroesch et al .",
    "1996 ; lu et al . 1996",
    "; prochaska & wolfe 2002 ; vladilo 2002 ; dessauges - zavadsky et al .",
    "2004 ) . in principle , comparisons between and may help to separate the two effects , as ti ( an @xmath11-element ) is overabundant , relative to fe and solar abundance ratios , in galactic metal - poor stars , but is typically more severely depleted than fe in the galactic ism ( e.g. , dessauges - zavadsky et al .",
    "2002 ; ledoux , bergeron , & petitjean 2002 ) . a super - solar ti / fe ratio in a qso absorber would thus seem to imply that more massive stars ( and associated type ii sne ) have dominated the heavy element enrichment of that system ( and that the effects of depletion are minimal )  _ if _ the depletion patterns in low - metallicity systems are similar to those found in our galaxy .    while the existing surveys of absorption have provided a general picture of the behaviour of titanium in the galactic ism , there are several aspects that remain poorly understood .",
    "the moderate spectral resolution of most of the existing data generally has not allowed detailed investigations of the properties of the individual interstellar components discerned in higher resolution spectra of , , and ( e.g. , welty , hobbs , & kulkarni 1994 ; welty , morton , & hobbs 1996 ; welty & hobbs 2001 ; price et al .",
    "2001 ) , which reveal variations in component properties ( e.g. , line widths , relative abundances ) on velocity scales of 12 km  s@xmath1 . moreover , while titanium is known to be severely depleted in some moderately reddened sight lines containing diffuse molecular material , little is known about the depletion behaviour of titanium in more heavily reddened sight lines ( which may include some denser gas ) .",
    "significantly enhanced depletions were not found for iron in several recent samples of translucent sight lines ( snow , rachford , & figoski 2002 ; jensen & snow 2007 ; miller et al .",
    "2007 ) , but enhanced depletions in individual dense components could have been masked by contributions from more diffuse gas in the relatively low - resolution _ fuse _ spectra ( fwhm @xmath0 20 km  s@xmath1 ) used in the first two studies .",
    "very little is known regarding the depletion behaviour of titanium ( and other elements ) in lower metallicity systems .",
    "for example , column densities have been reported for only a few sight lines in the lmc and smc ( caulet & newell 1996 ; welty et al .",
    "1999a , 2001 ; cox et al . 2006 , 2007 ) , where the current metallicities are typically 0.5 and 0.2 times solar , respectively ( e.g. , russell & dopita 1992 ; various references in the appendices in welty et al .",
    "1997 , 1999a ) .",
    "the relatively nearby magellanic clouds provide an important venue for studies of the interstellar abundance / depletion patterns in low - metallicity galaxies , because the total interstellar ( gas plus dust ) abundances of many elements may be inferred from analyses of the abundances in stellar atmospheres and gaseous nebulae .",
    "studies of the interstellar abundances in a small number of sight lines have revealed possible differences in depletion behaviour for mg , si , and ti ( versus fe and ni ) in at least some components in the lmc and smc ( welty et al .",
    "1997 , 1999a , 2001 , 2004 , and in prep .",
    "; see also sofia et al .",
    "2006 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we present several sets of absorption - line data , in order to further explore the behaviour of in different interstellar environments : ( 1 ) high - resolution ( fwhm = 1.31.5 km  s@xmath1 ) spectra of 17 relatively bright , lightly reddened galactic stars  to enable detailed comparisons with corresponding high - resolution spectra of , , , and  and thus estimation of the properties of individual components in those sight lines ; ( 2 ) moderate resolution ( fwhm = 3.44.5 km  s@xmath1 ) spectra of a number of fainter , more heavily reddened galactic stars  to investigate the depletion behaviour of ti in denser gas ; and ( 3 ) moderate resolution ( fwhm = 4.58.7 km  s@xmath1 ) spectra of 43 stars in the magellanic clouds  to examine the depletion behaviour of titanium in lower metallicity gas  to aid in understanding the abundances in even lower metallicity absorption - line systems seen toward distant qsos and gamma - ray bursts .",
