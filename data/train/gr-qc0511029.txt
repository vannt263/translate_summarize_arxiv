    "in this paper global solutions of the scalar wave equation in 2 + 1 and 3 + 1 dimensional flat wormholes are obtained . as a significant consequence of their non - trivial topology , wormholes admit closed timelike curves ( ctc s ) . as such",
    "they constitute a suitable framework for the study of the solutions of the scalar wave equation in a spacetime admitting closed timelike curves .",
    "again due to the topology of a wormhole , no single coordinate chart is sufficient to express the global geometry of the whole wormhole spacetime and it becomes necessary to develop techniques to handle global issues on the one hand and to investigate the propagation of scalar waves near closed timelike curves .",
    "it should be mentioned that there are works that study the scalar waves that are valid locally in a certain regions ( such as may be termed the throat ) of the wormhole @xcite .",
    "wormholes are widely studied and discussed , especially after the paper of morris and thorne , in the context of time travel @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the wave equation attracts attention in this sense that whether the anomalies of causality violations due to ctc s has corresponding footprints in the solutions of wave equation .",
    "the metric of the spacetime , as well as the topology , maybe the origin of the closed timelike curves , as in the case of gdel s universe @xcite .",
    "recently bachelot has studied the properties of wave equation on a class of spacetimes of this type @xcite .",
    "it may be an interesting question , whether the origin of the ctc s ( being topology induced or metric induced ) effects the global properties of the solutions .",
    "nevertheless , as proposed in the concluding remarks , the presence of ctc s due to topology does not seem to have a significant effect on the solutions of wave equation .",
    "cauchy problem of the scalar wave equation in the flat wormhole considered here is studied throughout by friedman and morris with a variety of other spacetimes admitting closed timelike curves @xcite,@xcite .",
    "they also proved that there exist a unique solution of cauchy problem for a class of spacetimes , including our case , with initial data given at past null infinity @xcite .    due to the wormhole structure ,",
    "the boundary conditions imposed in solving the helmholtz equation depends on the frequency .",
    "therefore spectral theorem is not applicable in a straight forward manner to express the solution of the wave equation as a superposition of  monochromatic wave solutions found in this work .",
    "however , in @xcite , it is proved using limiting absorption method that , the superpositions of the monochromatic wave solutions of the problem converge to the solution of wave equation .",
    "the problem can be handled as a cauchy problem with given initial data at past null infinity or alternatively as a scattering problem , i.e. finding scattered waves from wormhole handle given incident wave .",
    "our approach is similar to that used in scattering from infinite parallel cylinders @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 represents outgoing cylindrical ( or for 3 + 1 dimensions spherical ) waves emerging from the first and the second wormhole mouth respectively . in order to be able to apply the boundary conditions conveniently which arise from the peculiar topology of the wormhole in our case , it is necessary to express @xmath0 in terms of cylindrical ( spherical ) waves centered at second mouth and vice versa .",
    "addition theorems for cylindrical and spherical wave functions are employed for this purpose .",
    "the equations for the scattering coefficients of @xmath0 and @xmath1 that result from the boundary conditions in question are in general not amenable to direct algebraic manipulation .",
    "the multiple scattering method is applied to obtain an infinite series solution . on the other hand for some important limiting cases the equations solved explicitly .",
    "the solutions by these both methods are consistent with one other .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section ii , the spacetime is described and the general formulation of the problem is presented . in section iii , 2 + 1",
    "dimensional case is studied .",
    "the equations are presented , explicit solutions for two limiting cases are obtained , and finally the multiple scattering solution is applied . in section",
    "iv the same scheme as section iii  is followed for 3 + 1 dimensional case . in section v numerical verifications of the results obtained in section iii  are presented .",
    "section vi contains some concluding remarks .",

    "the solid line with ` + ' markers is the multiple scattering solution and the dashed line with ` x ' markers is the @xmath290 approximation solutions given by ( [ agd_b ] ) and ( [ agd_c ] ) .    [ ptb ]",
    "the principal purpose of the present work was to investigate the scalar waves in wormhole topology .",
    "as the wormhole considered is flat , no complications due to curvature arise .",
    "although the spacetime considered in this work admits ctcs for sufficiently large values of time lag @xmath23 , their existence has no influence on monochromatic waves .",
    "the closed timelike curves emerge when time lag @xmath23 is greater than @xmath291 .",
    "however , @xmath23 appears in the equations only as @xmath292 thus the solution remains the same for all integer @xmath138 s where @xmath293 and increasing @xmath23 does not change the nature of the solutions .",
    "this suggests that the presence of closed timelike curves does not have a dramatic effect on the scalar wave solutions .",
    "this should not be surprising considering that , in a wave equation , what really matters is presence of closed null curves , rather than closed timelike curves .",
    "it is reasonable to think that the existence of closed timelike curves will not effect the nature of the solutions as long as closed null curves are not present .",
    "ctc s are present in the flat wormhole spacetime studied here , but still they do nt have a significant effect on the solution . the reason is explained in @xcite : in this kind of spacetimes , the closed null curves are a set of measure zero and due to the diverging lens property of the wormhole , the strength of the field is weakened by a factor @xmath294 at each loop in the infinitely looping closed null geodesics .",
    "the complications related to closed timelike curves are due to difficulty in specifying a cauchy hypersurface when solving the cauchy problem .",
    "null geodesics are bicharacteristics of the wave equation and arbitrary initial data can not be properly posed in a null direction  @xcite .",
    "a spacelike hypersurface never contains vectors in a null direction , thus are good candidates for specifying initial data .",
    "however there always exist a null direction on a timelike point of a hypersurface . in the light of these discussions",
    "it can be conjectured that no complications arise on the solution of wave equation due to ctc s .",
    "the complications are mainly due to the nature of cauchy problem approach .    to make this point more apparent , let s consider a space - time with topology @xmath295 where @xmath296 is the temporal direction .",
    "clearly this spacetime admits closed timelike curves . in this spacetime , waves from only a discrete set of frequencies can exist due to periodicity conditions . but this restriction does not seem to be related to the existence of ctc s , because alternatively when a globally hyperbolic spacetime of topology @xmath297 is considered , it is easy to see that it has the same property : waves only from a discrete set of frequencies can exist in this spacetime , either .",
    "this observation also suggests that the restrictions on the solutions of wave equation are not due to existence of closed timelike curves .",
    "compactness of the topology in either temporal or spatial directions have both similar consequences .",
    "thus it is reasonable to expect that waves in a universe where time travel is possible , will have similar properties with globally hyperbolic ones .    if we consider the question in a purely mathematical point of view , the form of wave equation considered is almost symmetric with respect to time and space variables .",
    "for the 1 + 1 dimensions there is complete symmetry ( remembering that the minus sign on the time derivative does not effect the symmetry since it is always possible to reverse the signs ) and for higher dimensions the only difference is having more space variables .",
    "this suggest that there is no strong mathematical background for expecting disparate consequences of existence of ctc s compared to existence of closed curves along any space direction .",
    "on the other hand more space coordinates give rise to asymmetry between the spacelike hypersurfaces and the timelike hypersurfaces in cauchy problem due to the shape of the null cone : any timelike hypersurface passing through a spacetime point intersects the null cone of that point , while spacelike hypersurfaces does not .",
    "there is a strong analogy between 2 + 1 and 3 + 1 cases , which suggests that the results can be extended to @xmath298 dimensions easily . in any dimensions ,",
    "the solutions can be expressed in terms of spherical waves , @xmath299 , where @xmath182 is the radial distance and @xmath300 denotes the angular part @xcite .",
    "in addition , to be able to apply the same method , an addition theorem similar to that of the 2 + 1 and 3 + 1 dimensions is needed for this higher dimension .",
    "the similarity of ( [ 2da ] ) , ( [ 2db ] ) with ( [ 3da ] ) , ( [ 3db ] ) suggests that the solution for higher dimensions are readily given by these equations where the expressions of @xmath301 and @xmath302 in terms of @xmath303 and @xmath304 will be found using addition theorems of those dimensions .",
    "the author thanks cem tezer for his valuable guidance  and helpful discussions , john l. friedman for his significant comments , and ozgur sarioglu .",
