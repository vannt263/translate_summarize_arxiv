    "figure  [ fig : ese ] . because of the simultaneity of the events at different wavelengths , the time scales of the events , and light travel time arguments , eses are likely due to strong scattering by ionized structures , possibly in the galactic interstellar medium ( ism ; @xcite ) . first identified in the light curves of extragalactic sources ,",
    "eses have since been observed during a timing program of the pulsars @xcite and @xcite .",

    "these densities imply pressures @xmath6  k  @xmath5 or more , well in excess of the `` average '' interstellar pressure @xmath7  k  @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "a key issue regarding these ionized structures is their relationship to other phases of the interstellar medium .",
    "do they represent ( relatively ) isolated structures , perhaps in pressure balance with a lower density , higher temperature `` background '' phase @xcite ? or do they reflect a low level of cosmic - ray ionization within an otherwise neutral structure @xcite ? or are they perhaps not interstellar at all , but due to photoionized molecular clouds in the galactic halo @xcite ?",
    "this paper reports the first absorption measurements of a source ( ) while it was undergoing an . from these observations",
    "we can constrain the connection between the ionized structures responsible for eses and any neutral structures . in  [ sec : observe ] we describe the observations , in  [ sec : discuss ] we discuss the implications of our observations , and in  [ sec : conclude ] we present our conclusions and suggestions for future work .",
    "figure  [ fig : ese ] shows a portion of the 2.25 and 8.3  ghz light curve of as obtained by the us navy s extragalactic source monitoring program at the green bank interferometer @xcite . clearly evident is an approximately 50% decrease in the source s flux density at  2.25  ghz and an approximately 25% decrease at  8.3  ghz .",
    "the minimum occurred on or near 1992 may  25 ( jd  2448768.264 ) , and the 2.25  ghz flux density of the ese is nearly symmetric about this epoch .",

    "the shape of the line on  1991 september  6 is identical , though the maximum amplitude of the line differs by approximately 10% .",
    "we would not expect any change during the ese because the large primary beam of the vla antennas means that they are sensitive to emission on angular scales much larger than any structures plausibly responsible for the ese itself .",

    "the width of the emission line from our spectrum and the brightness temperature of the line are larger than that found by @xcite owing to the smaller diameter antenna in our case ( 25  m _ vs. _ 90  m ) .    because we are searching for changes in an absorption line with time , we discuss in detail the steps we took to calibrate these observations",
    ". our primary focus will be on the three observations with a common bandwidth and velocity resolution during the .",
    "the calibration of the wider bandwidth observations on 1992 june  6 was identical to the procedure described below .",
    "the calibration of the first epoch , 1991 september  6 , was extremely similar ; we shall only point out the minor ways in which it differed from the calibration of the other four observations .",
    "the conventional calibration of spectral - line observations involves determining a bandpass correction .",
    "with such widely distributed emission as for the line , position - switched observations of another source can not be utilized to find the bandpass correction , and frequency switching requires observations both above and below the line .",
    "furthermore , frequency switching can introduce phase jumps , which would then be propagated into the bandpass correction , and errors introduced in the frequency switching ultimately limit the bandpass that can be obtained @xcite . in this case ,",
    "frequency - switched observations both above and below the line were available only on 1991 september  6 and then only for .    more important than the shape of the bandpass during any particular observation , however , is its stability from one observation to the next , particularly during the . in order to assess this stability , we constructed bandpass corrections for each of the three ese epochs using the off - line scans on . for any given antenna at any epoch ,",
    "the amplitude of the bandpass correction was within 8.4% of unity with a standard deviation of approximately 5% and the maximum phase correction was no more than 75 with a standard deviation of approximately 5 .",
    "we decided ultimately to forego a bandpass correction .",
    "as further insurance against any bandpass - induced changes , we also excluded the first and last 16  channels from the analysis .",
    "we also repeated the calibration described here for the 1992 june  6 observations , including various bandpass calibrations determined from the off - line scans of .",
    "we discuss the results in more quantitative detail below , but the lack of a bandpass calibration produces no significant change in the absorption spectra we measure .    amplitude calibration was performed using and  .",
    "the frequency offsets between the on - line scans and the frequencies at which and   were observed contribute to less than a 0.1% bias in the flux density calibration .",
    "far more important is the contribution of the line emission to the system temperature of the on - line scans . in order to avoid a bias , we determined the antenna gain amplitudes for using the off - line scans only , then applied these to both the on- and off - line scans . for the 1991 september  6 observations , for which no off - line scans of were available , we used channels well outside the range over which the emission was seen .",
    "typical differences between the flux densities on- and off - line were 1015% . as is itself a vla calibrator and well approximated by a point source over the range of available baselines , the visibility phases were calibrated using the off - line scans on itself .",
    "the observations during the three ese epochs were acquired when the vla was in its most compact configurations ( dnc and d ) . in these configurations",
    "the emission may not be entirely resolved out , particularly on the shortest baselines . as a result there may be contamination of the spectra from the changing sky distribution of the emission moving through the vla s sidelobes as the vla tracks the source @xcite .",
    "after amplitude and phase calibration , we inspected the visibility amplitudes and phases on the shorter baselines for evidence of line contamination .",
    "we found that some shorter baselines did show phase and/or amplitude offsets characteristic of such contamination . as a precaution we eliminated baselines shorter than 125  m ( 600@xmath13 ) from further analysis for all epochs .    before imaging the data ,",
    "a single iteration of phase - only self - calibration was performed on a single continuum channel in the on - line data .",
    "the starting model was a point source , with the flux density appropriate for each epoch ( table  [ tab : log ] ) .",
    "is well approximated by a point source for all vla configurations , and we subtracted the continuum in the visibility domain , utilizing line - free channels of the on - line data to generate a linear baseline .",
    "we imaged and cleaned each channel of the data cube separately .",
    "we also produced a continuum image from the line - free channels of the on - line data ( prior to performing the continuum subtraction ) .",
    "absorption spectra were formed by integrating the continuum - subtracted data cube over a region whose size was that of the synthesized beam and which was centered on the position of .",
    "these were converted to opacity spectra using the flux density determined by fitting a gaussian function to the continuum image .",
    "figure  [ fig : absorb ] shows the resulting opacity spectra for the four epochs .",
    "all of the spectra show the presence of a strong absorption feature near  5  , a slight curvature resulting from the absence of a bandpass correction , and a typical rms determined outside the line of @xmath14 .",
    "our absorption spectra are in good agreement with that found by @xcite .    as a further assurance that our lack of a bandpass calibration has not introduced significant uncertainties",
    ", we repeated the above analysis using two different bandpass corrections applied to the 1992 june  6 observations .",
    "we applied a bandpass correction determined from the off - line scans of from 1992 june  6 and from 1992 june  24 . in both cases ,",
    "the spectral baseline after correction is more nearly constant with velocity .",
    "the rms uncertainty in the opacity spectrum increases slightly with the application of the 1992 june  6 bandpass correction and little , if at all , with the application of the 1992 june  24 bandpass correction .",
    "the increase in the rms uncertainty is approximately 25% from @xmath15 to @xmath16 . in order to account for the uncertainties resulting from the lack of a bandpass calibration and from any possible changes between epochs",
    ", we shall use the value @xmath17 as the value for the typical uncertainty in the opacity spectrum at all three epochs during the .",
    "in this section we first assess the extent to which there are any changes in the absorption spectra .",
    "we then discuss what this implies about neutral structures along the line of sight to during the .",
    "we shall consider three quantities that might be expected to change during the ese  the equivalent width of the line , @xmath18 ; the maximum absorption and its velocity ; and the shape of the line .",

    "the maximum optical depth for the ese epochs is @xmath19 and occurs at  5.8  .",
    "the equivalent width is @xmath20  , and from table  [ tab : sum ] the maximum difference in @xmath21 between any two epochs is 0.03  .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty in @xmath21 as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the velocity extent of the line , @xmath24  .",
    "thus , @xmath25  , and we conclude that there has been no change in the equivalent width of the line .    one notable difference between the absorption spectra of 1991 september  6 and the ese epochs is the change in the maximum optical depth .",
    "the maximum optical depth for all four of our epochs also differs from previous observations by @xcite , @xmath26 , and @xcite , @xmath27 .",
    "@xcite observed using an interferometer composed of the nrao 140  ft and  300  ft telescopes in  1980 and  1981 .",
    "@xcite observed using the phased vla in  1982 .",
    "there is some danger in comparing observations from different telescopes , and the large optical depth found by @xcite has a large uncertainty associated with it .",
    "nonetheless , these changes in the optical depth are indicative of a decreasing secular trend in the column density by  50% or more over the decade between the various observations .",
    "qualitatively , there do appear to be fine scale changes in the line shape from epoch to epoch during the .",
    "in particular the line has two , nearly equally deep minima on 1992 june  6 , but only a single deep minimum in the other two epochs .",
    "we assess the significance of this difference in the line shape quantitatively by finding the maximum difference in optical depth between two epochs at the same velocity ( columns  4 and  5 of table  [ tab : sum ] ) .",
    "the maximum optical depth difference between any two epochs occurs between 1992 june  6 and june  24 and is @xmath28 .",
    "the maximum difference between 1992 june  6 and july  28 is 0.045 .",
    "( the difference between 1992 june  24 and july  28 is half this value , reflecting their qualitatively more similar shapes . )",
    "we do not regard any of these differences as significant .",
    "the rms uncertainty in an individual opacity spectrum is @xmath29 . adding the uncertainties from two spectra in quadrature , the combined uncertainty is 0.021 , meaning that the maximum deviation is less than 2.3@xmath30 .",
    "we have also examined the difference spectra ( i.e. , the spectra formed by taking the difference in the absorption spectra at two epochs ) for any skewness .",
    "if line features either appear or disappear , one would expect an excess of either positive or negative deviations about the average .",
    "conversely , if the deviations are simply the result of measurement uncertainty , there should be a roughly equal number of positive and negative deviations about the average .",
    "the latter is the case for all three difference spectra .",
    "in addition to the line shape not changing by any significant amount , there is also no evidence for the appearance of additional absorption components at other velocities .",
    "the only significant absorption occurs between  @xmath31 and  10  for all four epochs .",
    "we can also compare the absorption spectrum from our wider bandwidth ( 1.56  mhz ; 1992 june  6 ) to those of @xcite as they have a similar velocity coverage .",
    "both spectra have a single deep absorption feature , with no significant absorption outside of it .",
    "our limit on changes in the optical depth during the ese of @xmath32 implies the neutral column density change during the ese must be limited to @xmath33 for the structure(s ) responsible for the . here",
    "@xmath0 is the spin temperature of the within the structure , and we have assumed that the structure responsible for this ese is optically thin to radiation .",
    "this assumption is justified by the lack of a large change in the profile .",
    "we consider @xmath34  k and @xmath35  k as possible values for @xmath0 .",
    "the former value is motivated from observations by @xcite who find a typical value of @xmath36   for 14 lines of sight with a galactic latitude @xmath37 ( has @xmath38 and is one of the 14 lines of sight observed ) .",
    "the latter value is motivated from models by @xcite and @xcite , who have both proposed a population of cold , small - scale structures .",
    "if @xmath34  k , then @xmath39  .",
    "this is not a stringent limit .",
    "models of ese lenses require electron column densities  @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "we presume that any structure associated with an ese lens will have a size scale of order the ese lens , namely au scale .",
    "if the neutral structure is in approximate pressure balance _ with the ese lens _ ( which itself may be overpressure with respect to the ambient medium ,  [ sec : intro ] ) , then the neutral structure would have column densities @xmath41  , well below this observational limit .",
    "if @xmath35  k , then @xmath42  .",
    "this limit marginally rules out heiles  ( 1997 ) proposed tiny - scale atomic structures ( tsass ) as being responsible for the .",
    "tsass are au - scale structures distributed throughout the galactic interstellar medium with neutral column densities @xmath43  and interior temperatures @xmath44  k. @xcite proposes tsass in order to explain observations of small ( angular ) scale changes in the opacity , though he does not associate tsass explicitly with eses .",
    "obviously , geometrical factors ( e.g. , a line of sight that does not cut through the center of a tsas ) could account for the discrepancy . other indications of an association between tsass and ionized structures are also not clear - cut .",
    "in favor of an association is that @xcite reproduced the ese light curve of by assuming a gaussian refracting lens passed in front of the source ; they find an electron column density of  @xmath45  @xmath5  pc is required to produce the light curve , comparable to what the tsass should have in their interiors due to photoionization @xcite . on the other hand a comparable change in the dispersion measure of psr  b0823@xmath4626 occurred @xcite with no change in the opacity @xcite .",
    "though , after the conclusion of the dm monitoring program , an opacity change was detected .",
    "our limit on @xmath47 appears to rule out galactic halo molecular clouds , the au - scale , -opaque structures that @xcite have proposed to explain eses .",
    "the photoionized skins of these clouds would provide the necessary refracting media for eses .",
    "we see no indication of a @xmath48 feature in our spectra ( though walker  2000 , private communication , has since suggested that @xmath49 might be more accurate ) .",
    "@xcite point out that , because of multiple imaging , an absorption line during an ese could saturate with a non - zero intensity , but @xcite find no evidence of multiple imaging in vlbi images of acquired at similar epochs as these absorption measurements .",
    "however , as halo objects , the clouds could have velocities approaching 500  ( i.e. , a velocity range of  1000  ) .",
    "the velocity range of our observations , even the wide bandwidth observations of 1992 june  6 , is considerably less , being no more than 250  .",
    "thus , a significant absorption line could have been present outside of our velocity range .",
    "all models considered thus far have explained an ese as being due to an ionized object , either partially or totally ionized , occulting a background source .",
    "an alternate possibility is suggested by the decrease in the optical depth observed between the 1991 september  6 observations and the epochs during the . if an ionizing source crossed the line of sight to and ionized some of the hydrogen , the result would be a decrease in the optical depth of the line .",
    "the difference in equivalent widths between 1991 september  6 and the epochs during the ese is 1.47  . the resulting total change in the column density , integrated over the line is @xmath50 .",
    "we assume that any such ionized region would be comparable in extent to the angular diameter of , about 0.5  mas ( fey , unpublished data ) . at a distance of  100  pc ,",
    "the total quantity of hydrogen that would have been ionized was @xmath51  atoms .",
    "an estimate of the ionizing rate required to maintain the ionization for this many atoms is , following @xcite , at least @xmath52 , assuming that the ionized region was approximately spherical . an a0 star would suffice as an ionizing source .",
    "we have determined the opacity spectra for at four epochs , including three as it underwent an extreme scattering event ( figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] ) .",
    "the absorption spectra from the four epochs are dominated by a strong absorption feature centered on an lsr velocity of  5  .",
    "the absorption feature itself is probably a blend of multiple components .",
    "our absorption spectra are quite similar to a lower - resolution spectrum obtained by @xcite .",
    "we find a secular trend of decreasing maximum optical depth during the decade between the observations of @xcite , @xcite , and those reported here . in the early 1980s ,",

    "the maximum optical depth change between any two epochs during the ese is @xmath32 ( @xmath55 ) which we do not regard as significant .",
    "the limit on the optical depth change , @xmath32 , implies a limit on the column density of any neutral structure(s ) associated with the ese lens , @xmath56 , having a spin temperature @xmath57  .",

    "some proposed colder structures are allowed .",
