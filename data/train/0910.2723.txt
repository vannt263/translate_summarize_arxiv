    "the standard @xmath0cdm model is based on einstein s gravitational theory ( gr ) and the cosmological principle : there is no special place in the universe - the universe is isotropic and homogeneous .",
    "the assumptions of an isotropic and homogeneous universe were used to develop the lematre - friedmann - robertson - walker ( lfrw ) expanding universe model , which forms the basis of the standard modern @xmath0cdm cosmology .",
    "although this model has successfully described the available cosmological observations , in particular , the wmap cmb data  @xcite , it has about 8 free adjustable parameters and relies heavily on the simplest assumption of maximal symmetry , the lfrw geometry of spacetime and that gr is the correct theory of gravity to describe the large scale structure of the universe .",
    "a disturbing feature of the standard @xmath0cdm model is that roughly 96 percent of the universe is invisible .",
    "approximately 30 percent is composed of  dark matter \" , while 70 percent is the dark energy that pervades the universe like a modern - day ether , and is responsible for the asserted acceleration of the expansion of the universe invoked to explain the supernovae observations  @xcite .",
    "the dark matter has been postulated to explain the rotation curve data of galaxies , the stability of clusters of galaxies , merging clusters such as the bullet cluster , gravitational lensing and the wmap data .",
    "after several years of searching for the ubiquitous dark matter , no successful detection of dark matter particles has been achieved . by its nature",
    "the dark matter particles interact only with gravity , so the existence of dark matter is inferred through gravitational observations such as galaxy rotation curves .",
    "the dark energy is a mysterious and undetectable uniform substance that has been identified with negative pressure vacuum energy .",
    "this interpretation falls prey to the serious lack of understanding of vacuum density in quantum field theory , leading to preposterous degrees of fine - tuning to agree with the  observed \" vacuum density associated with the cosmological constant @xmath0 . to avoid this problem",
    ", many modified gravity theories have been proposed that devote themselves to explaining the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "many of these theories suffer from maladies that render them unphysical .",
    "they can possess ghosts and instabilities and not be able to explain the precise relativistic corrections engendered by gr in the solar system , such as the cassini spacecraft observation of the eddington - robertson ppn parameter @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "an early extensive study of cosmological voids  @xcite in the exact lematre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) inhomogeneous solution of gr  @xcite , predicted that the luminosity distance in a void solution would depend on the red shift @xmath2 in a way that deviates from the lfrw model prediction  @xcite .",
    "the distance modulus calculated from the void model in 1994 - 95 suggested an _",
    "apparent _ acceleration of the expansion of the universe as inferred by an observer in an flrw spacetime  @xcite .",
    "indeed , four years before the celebrated supernovae sne ia observations , it was clear that _ if the inhomogeneous void scenario is correct _ , then the observed dimming of the supernovae light was to be expected .",
    "however , the void solution demanded that the observer be situated close to the center of the void to maintain the observed isotropy of the large scale structure of the universe .",
    "this would imply a violation of the cosmological copernican principle .",
    "the adherence to a dark energy such as the vacuum energy in the @xmath0cdm model , also suffers from an anti - copernican principle fine - tuning in coordinate time .",
    "the negative pressure dark energy and the associated acceleration of the expansion of the universe began dominating the evolution of the standard model when life first appeared on our planet .",
    "this is referred to as the  coincidence \" problem .",
    "thus , we are faced with having to make a choice between two theoretical evils , the dark energy scenario or the more conservative inhomogeneous void scenario .",
    "as has been recently demonstrated  @xcite , it is difficult with the presently available observational data to distinguish between the idealistic copernican principle cosmology and those cosmological models that violate it .",
    "one ongoing vexing problem with the postulate of a cosmological constant in the @xmath0cdm standard model is our lack of understanding of the vacuum density in physics .",
    "the notorious cosmological constant problem remains unresolved , leading to a huge fine - tuning problem .",
    "for example , in the standard electroweak model with a higgs particle the predicted vacuum density is of order @xmath3 times bigger than the vacuum density required in the @xmath0cdm model  @xcite .",
    "the problem becomes even more pronounced when energy scales reach the planck energy @xmath4 gev , resulting in a fine - tuning of order @xmath5 compared to the  observed \" cosmological constant .",
    "a relativistic modified gravity ( mog ) theory known as the scalar - tensor - vector gravity ( stvg ) theory has been applied successfully to fit astrophysical as well as cosmological data  @xcite without non - baryonic dark matter .",
    "thus , if exotic dark matter remains undetected ( as was the nineteenth century ether ) , then to explain the extensive astrophysical and cosmological data , we are forced to modify newtonian and einstein gravity . in  @xcite ,",
    "the mog was able to also explain the accelerated expansion of the universe without a cosmological constant , although this explanation was also subject to the fine - tuned coincidence problem .",
    "in contrast to this need to modify gravity to avoid postulating an undetected dark matter , the void solution to the sne ia supernovae observations does not require a modification of einstein s gravity theory due to its claim that there is no `` dark energy '' .",
    "an underdense void expands faster than its more dense surrounding galaxies , whereby younger supernovae inside the void would be observed to be receding more rapidly than older supernovae outside the void . by assuming the lfrw homogeneity , the mistaken conclusion",
    "would be reached that the expansion rate of the universe is accelerating , while in fact the local void and the global universe are actually decelerating .",
    "the local void scenario has been investigated by many authors . for a review ,",
    "see  @xcite and for more recent citations see  @xcite",
    ". there are other problems occurring in the void model , in addition to giving up the cosmological copernican principle .",
    "to fit the cmb data and other pertinent cosmological data , the radial size of the void required to fit the supernovae data is hundreds of mpc to gpc , and we must be close to the center of the void to avoid an unacceptably large cmb dipole  @xcite .",
    "another problem to be considered in the inhomogeneous void model is the assumed initial conditions of the universe . strictly speaking",
    ", simple models of inflation would be inconsistent with the existence of a large inhomogeneous void .",
    "however , there exists an alternative solution to the initial value horizon and flatness problems .",
    "this is based on a bimetric gravity variable speed of light ( vsl ) model  @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated by magueijo  @xcite that this model in conjunction with the dirac - born - infeld model can predict almost scale invariant primordial fluctuations in agreement with observations without inflation .",
    "this model would not necessarily negate the possibility of large , nonlinear and inhomogeneous voids .    in the following , we will review discoveries made in the early investigations of the void model  @xcite , and consider the age problem in cosmology and how the inhomogeneous cosmology can ameliorate this problem .",
    "we also consider the possible amplification of growth structure and its early onset in the inhomogeneous ltb model .",
    "we do not consider the important issue of confronting the void model with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) wmap data  @xcite .",
    "attempts to do this have been made in the recent literature  @xcite .",
    "these investigations remain inconclusive as to how well the void model can produce the acoustical power spectrum , the matter power spectrum associated with large scale surveys of galaxies and the observed baryon acoustical oscillations ( bao ) in the correlation function .",
    "the role of structure growth in the inhomogeneous models plays an important role in these cosmological calculations , as does the importance of contributions from ",
    "warm \" dark matter such as neutrinos with a mass not violating recent upper bounds obtained from wmap observations .",
    "we conclude that the void model has not been ruled out",
    ". however , the best fits to the cmb wmap data and the bao appear to require a low value of @xmath6 compared to measurements of @xmath7  @xcite . we should nonetheless be cautious about the true value of @xmath7 , for it has a long history of changing its value with time .",
    "moreover , in an inhomogeneous cosmology the value of the hubble constant is position dependent .",
    "the local measured value of @xmath7 near the center of the void is expected to be larger than in distant parts of the universe outside the void .",
    "this could accommodate fits to the cmb data at the surface of last scattering with lower values of @xmath7 than would be measured by an observer close to the center of the void .",
    "for the sake of notational clarity , we write the flrw line element @xmath8 where @xmath9 for a closed , flat and open universe , respectively , and @xmath10 .",
    "the general , spherically symmetric inhomogeneous line element is given by  @xcite : @xmath11 the energy - momentum tensor @xmath12 takes the barytropic form @xmath13 where @xmath14 and , in general , the density @xmath15 and the pressure @xmath16 depend on both @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",

    "the metric becomes : @xmath60 where @xmath61 and from ( [ dens ] ) the density is given by @xmath62 clearly , we have for finite @xmath63 that for @xmath64 the model tends to the flat einstein  de sitter case .    the flat case ( @xmath57 ) has been extensively studied  @xcite .",
    "the model depends on one arbitrary function @xmath65 and could be specified by assuming the density on some space - like hypersurface , say @xmath66 .",
    "however , specifying the density on the past light cone of the observer is more appropriate .    before we proceed to discuss the observational grounds for modeling a local void , we need to amplify the discussion of the ltb model by introducing basic features of the propagation of light .",
    "the high degree of isotropy of the microwave background forces us to the conclusion that we must be located close to the spatial center of the local ltb void .",
    "we place an observer at the center ( @xmath67 ) .",

    "we can not rule out the possibility yet that the inhomogeneous void cosmology can fit this data satisfactorily .",
    "the question as to how perturbation growth of structure both in the primordial cosmology and in later time cosmology is affected by inhomogeneous perturbation calculations is not yet fully understood .",
    "this means that we have to be cautious about applying computer codes such as cmbfast and camb , which were designed exclusively to give fits to data based on the standard @xmath0cdm model , to the more general inhomogeneous cosmology models .",
    "the problem of the age of the universe and the amplification of perturbation calculations of structure growth and correlation functions have been addressed here .",
    "we found that as already discovered 1n one of the first phenomenological investigations of the inhomogeneous void cosmology  @xcite , based on the exact pressureless lbt model , the age of the universe problem can be solved in these models and that an increased amplification and early onset of structure growth is to be expected .",
    "an alternative inhomogeneous cosmology model based on the szekeres - szafron  @xcite exact solution of einstein s field equations has been investigated  @xcite .",
    "the solution does not in general have any symmetry and incorporates pressure as well as energy density .",
    "a particular cylindrically symmetric szafron solution was studied , which can describe an early universe with non - uniform inflation , has homogeneous lfrw behavior at the surface of last scattering and can become inhomogeneous at a late time of the expansion of the universe .",
