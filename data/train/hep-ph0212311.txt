    "these massless pseudoscalars dominate the low energy dynamics of qcd and interact weekly at low energies @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the hadronic scale corresponding to the masses of the lightest nongoldstone hadrons .",
    "the most important order parameters of this pattern of ssb are the goldstone boson decay constant @xmath11 and the quark condensate is however more fundamental in the sense that @xmath12 means both necessary and sufficient condition for ssb , while @xmath13 corresponds to the sufficient condition only . ]",

    "the lagrangian of @xmath25 can be constructed on the base of symmetry arguments only ; the unknown information about the nonperturbative properties of qcd are hidden in the parameters known as low energy constants ( lec)@xcite .    in order to be able to treat the effective theory as an expansion in powers of @xmath26 (",

    "these are real and first order polynomials in @xmath98 , so that we can parametrize them with ( altogether 11 ) real parameters . adding to this the 2 extra real coefficients of @xmath1 part of the subtraction polynomial @xmath79 , it is possible to parametrize the @xmath1 amplitude @xmath75 in terms of 13 real free parameters[multiblock footnote omitted ] . as a result of the iterative procedure we get for the @xmath1 unitarity corrections @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 the following formulas : @xmath99 and where @xmath100 is the chew - mandelstam function , cf.@xcite .",
