    "the measurement of deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , @xmath79 , at hera has shown a rapid rise of the proton structure function @xmath80 with decreasing @xmath7 for @xmath81  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding increase of the virtual photon - proton cross section @xmath82 with the centre - of - mass energy @xmath83 is much stronger than that of @xmath84 for real photons  @xcite .",
    "the slower increase of the real photoproduction cross section is consistent with the energy behaviour of hadron - hadron total cross sections . in perturbative qcd",
    "the rise of @xmath0 at low @xmath7 is ascribed to an increase in the sea quark density  @xcite , and the significance thereof is discussed extensively in the literature  @xcite .",
    "one of the important questions is how far perturbative qcd retains its validity as one probes large parton densities . until now",
    "the hera measurements of @xmath0 have covered @xmath8 values above 4.5 @xmath85 .",
    "it is of great interest to extend the @xmath0 measurement to lower @xmath8 values and study the low @xmath7 behaviour in the transition region between photoproduction and dis .    in this paper ,",
    "@xmath0 measurements , from @xmath86 dis data , at @xmath87 and at @xmath8 values as low as 1.5  @xmath85 are reported .",
    "access to such low @xmath8 values is achieved in two different ways .",
    "for the first analysis ( svx ) hera is operated with the interaction point shifted in the proton direction in order to improve the acceptance for small positron scattering angles .",
    "the second analysis ( isr ) uses dis events from the nominal interaction point with initial state photon radiation where the radiated photon is detected .",
    "these events effectively have a lower initial positron beam energy and thus for a fixed acceptance of the positron scattering angle events with smaller values of @xmath8 can be reconstructed .",
    "the reconstruction of events having positrons scattered at small angles is improved compared to the 1993 analysis by the addition of the small angle rear tracking detector ( srtd ) .",
    "the data were taken with the zeus detector at hera in 1994 .",
    "hera operated with 153 colliding bunches of 820  gev protons and 27.5 gev positrons .",
    "additional unpaired positron and proton bunches circulated , which are used to determine beam related background .",
    "the root mean square of the proton bunch length was approximately 20 cm while the positron bunch length was negligible in comparison , leading to an interaction length having a root mean square of 10 cm .",
    "for the svx analysis , the mean interaction vertex was moved from @xmath88 = 0 to @xmath88 = 67 cm   axis pointing in the proton beam direction , and the @xmath89 axis horizontal , pointing towards the centre of hera .",
    "the origin is at the nominal interaction point . ] .",
    "approximately 5% of the proton current was contained in satellite bunches , which were shifted by 4.8  ns with respect to the primary bunch crossing time , resulting in a fraction of the @xmath4 interactions occurring on average + 72  cm upstream of the primary position .",
    "the svx analysis is based on an integrated luminosity of 58  @xmath90 collected while hera operated with the shifted interaction point .",
    "the isr analysis uses 2.5  @xmath91 of data taken with hera operating with the interaction point at the nominal position , @xmath92 .",
    "a description of the zeus detector can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the primary components used in these analyses are the uranium - scintillator calorimeter ( cal )  @xcite and the tracking detectors .",
    "the calorimeter covers 99.7% of the total solid angle and is subdivided into electromagnetic ( emc ) and hadronic ( hac ) sections with typical cell sizes of @xmath93 @xmath94 ( @xmath95  @xmath94 in the rear calorimeter ( rcal ) , i.e. in the positron beam direction ) and @xmath96  @xmath94 respectively .",

    "the interaction vertex is measured with a resolution along ( transverse to ) the beam direction of 0.4  ( 0.1 )  cm .",
    "the position of positrons scattered close to the positron beam direction is determined by the srtd which is attached to the front face of the rcal .",
    "the srtd consists of two planes of scintillator strips , 1 cm wide and 0.5 cm thick , arranged in orthogonal directions and read out via optical fibres and photomultiplier tubes .",
    "it covers the region of 68  @xmath102  68  @xmath103 in @xmath89 and @xmath104 and is positioned at @xmath105  cm .",

    "the lumi photon calorimeter is also used to measure the energy and position of photons from initial state radiation in dis events .",
