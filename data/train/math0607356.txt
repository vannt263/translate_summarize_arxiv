    "the fact that the curvature operator of the evolving metrics becomes either @xmath0-positive or nonnegative has been observed in @xcite .",
    "however , in @xcite there is no clear statement of the strong maximum principle , namely corollary [ strong1 ] , on which the observation relies . if evoking theorem 2.3 of @xcite , the splitting result on solutions of ricci flow on complete riemannian manifold with nonnegative curvature operator , we can write a similar statement even when @xmath80 is not assume to be compact . however , in this case the euclidean factor is only topological ( not isometric ) .",

    "in fact for @xmath123 $ ] it is transverse to the boundary of the set at all boundary points @xmath124 .",
    "we claim that there exists @xmath111 so small that @xmath125 , which is equivalent to that @xmath126 . for simplicity",
    "let @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "direct computation shows that @xmath130 which implies that @xmath131 and @xmath132 let @xmath133 be the eigenvalues of @xmath134 . then by the assumption ( [ pin1 ] ) we have that @xmath135 clearly we also have that @xmath136 we first check that @xmath43 satisfies the ricci pinching condition .",
    "in fact if @xmath137 are the eigenvalues of @xmath138 , from the above formulae we have that @xmath139 then there exist @xmath140 and @xmath141 such that for all @xmath142 $ ] , @xmath143 . then we can find @xmath144 such that for any @xmath145 $ ] , @xmath146 . hence @xmath147 satisfies the pinching condition of @xmath148 .",
    "now we check that @xmath149 .",
    "rewrite @xmath150 noticing that @xmath151 as @xmath152 , we can find @xmath153 such that for any @xmath154 $ ] we have that @xmath155 but the eigenvalue ( with respect to @xmath49 , where @xmath156 is a basis of @xmath33 consisting of eigenvectors of @xmath134 ) of the right hand side operator can be computed as @xmath157 using ( [ pin3 ] ) , the above can be bounded from below by @xmath158 if @xmath159 is close to @xmath160 .",
    "this shows that there exists @xmath161 such that for any @xmath162 $ ] , @xmath163 .",
    "now the virtue of the proof of theorem 5.1 in @xcite , along with the short time existence result of @xcite , shows that the ricci flow has long time solution .",
    "otherwise , by theorem 16.2 of @xcite , we would end up with a blow - up solution , which is nonflat , noncompact , but whose curvature operator @xmath164 . in view of schur",
    "s theorem , this is a contradiction .",
    "note that @xmath163 allows us to apply the generalized pinching set construction ( theorem 4.1 ) from @xcite , and since the evolving metric has positive curvature operator and the manifold is assumed to be noncompact , the injectivity radius always has a lower bound in terms of the size of the curvature .",
    "all these ingredients allow us to perform hamilton s blow - up analysis @xcite ( theorem 16.2 ) .",
    "we continue to show that the extra assumption that @xmath80 is noncompact will lead us to a contradiction by performing the singularity analysis of @xcite as @xmath165 . notice that for all @xmath166 , @xmath81 will stay in the cone @xmath120 for some fixed ( but sufficiently small ) @xmath159 , by the tensor maximum principle , which can be verified in the same way as proposition [ chen1 ] .",
    "now we claim that the curvature of @xmath26 satisfies that @xmath167 for some @xmath168 .",
    "let @xmath169 .",
    "first , by lemma [ keylemma1 ] we know that @xmath170 for some fixed small @xmath159 .",
    "thus we can find @xmath171 such that @xmath172 .",
    "now let @xmath173 and @xmath137 be the eigenvalues of @xmath138 . by the assumption we have that @xmath174 .",
    "now we compute the ricci curvature and its trace for @xmath175 . by the definition of @xmath176 we have that @xmath177 and @xmath178 letting @xmath179",
    "be the eigenvalue of @xmath175 we have that @xmath180 .",
    "therefore @xmath181 here we have used the fact that @xmath182 .",
    "this completes the proof of the claim ( [ ric - pin ] ) .    since for all @xmath26 , its ricci curvature satisfies ( [ ric - pin ] ) , this holds up on the blow - down / blow - up solutions , which after passing to its universal cover , are either a nonflat gradient steady soliton or a nonflat gradient expanding soliton , with nonnegative curvature operator , by results from @xcite ( theorem 16.2 , corollary 16.4 ) ( see also @xcite , theorem 4.2 and @xcite )",
    "this contradicts to corollary 3.1 of @xcite .",
    "in @xcite , the topology of so - called @xmath183-positive manifolds was studied . in view of the result of bhm - wilking ,",
