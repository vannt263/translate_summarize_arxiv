    "during the t  tauri phase , models have shown that giant planet formation rely heavily on the timescale and manner in which gas disks disperse ( see , e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we now know that some of this gas is incorporated into gaseous giant planets , while some is lost to the stars , and that most of the gas disappears on timescales of a few myr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , we still do not know whether most of the gas disks around t  tauri stars is photoevaporated by the star ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , blown away by wind @xcite , or accreted onto the star due to viscous diffusion @xcite .",
    "which mechanism dominates will determine how long gas resides in different parts of the disk . observing protoplanetary disks near their final stages may yield clue to this puzzle .",
    "debris disks are circumstellar disks that show emission from dust .",
    "these disks are detectable for up to a few gyr @xcite .",
    "both the level of emission and the fraction of stars with a detectable excess decay with time and can be interpreted , at least for the case of a stars , as steady state collisional processing of planetesimals formed during the proto - planetary disk phase @xcite .",
    "there is some evidence that gas may persist in debris disks for an extended period of time , at least in some systems .",
    "for example , atomic gas in keplerian rotation has been detected around the @xmath2myr old main - sequence star @xmath0pic @xcite .",
    "gas has also been found around post - t  tauri stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and even stars as old as 200myr ( e.g.  @xmath3her ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , it is not clear whether this gas is primordial ( left - over proto - planetary material ) or secondary , generated by , e.g. , sublimation of planetesimals @xcite , vaporization of colliding planetesimals @xcite , and/or photo - desorption of dust @xcite . if gas is indeed secondary ( as dynamical arguments suggest , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it presents an exciting new tool to study the compositions of solid bodies in extra - solar systems , unaccessible otherwise .",
    "in addition , even a small quantity of gas may also significantly affect the dynamics of the dust and cause grain concentrations , mimicking the bright rings seen in young debris disks like hr4796a @xcite .",
    "furthermore , gas present during late stages of planet formation could damp eccentricities of the planetesimals enough to reduce their relative speed , thereby aiding the build up of rocky planets .",
    "unfortunately , the information currently available on the manner in which gas disperses in circumstellar disks is scarce , owing to the great difficulty in detecting gas in these environments .",
    "accretion traces only the sub - au region of the disk , leaving the outer gas disk largely unconstrained .",
    "molecular emission from co in young circumstellar disks has been detected in the near - infrared ( nir ) and in the mm ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the nir emission is limited to hot co ( @xmath4k ) , while the detection of mm emission from cold co is hampered by limited sensitivity due to beam dilution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "direct detection of h@xmath5 in the ultra violet ( uv ) and nir is also made possible by either very hot or fluorescent gas ( pumped by ly@xmath6 , * ? ? ?",
    "the rotational lines h@xmath5 s(0 ) and s(1 ) emitted from colder gas ( @xmath7k ) are unfortunately weak and difficult to observe : a spitzer irs survey of young stars that are expected to have gas disks yielded only upper limits on the gas disk mass ( upper limits @xmath8 , * ? ? ?",
    "an alternative is to observe stellar light scattered resonantly by the gas , but this requires a spatially resolved disk to be detectable . to date , only the disk around @xmath0pic has been detected in such a way @xcite .",
    "should the disk be oriented edge - on , the circumstellar gas can also be observed in absorption ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    here , we study infrared atomic cooling lines as promising agents for characterizing gas in tenuous disks , including late stage protoplanetary disks and debris disks .",
    "three of the most abundant species , oxygen , carbon , and silicon , all have ground - state fine transitions at infrared wavelengths that act as effective coolants .",
    "oxygen , in the low - density environment of these disks , is likely to be in the atomic form : the molecular repositories for oxygen ( h@xmath5o , oh , and co ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are dissociated easily in the circumstellar environment , while the ionization potential for oxygen is sufficiently high for it to remain neutral .",
    "moreover , neutral oxygen does not have strong resonant transitions in the optical and uv , and is thus not easily removed by radiation pressure , unlike some other species @xcite .",
    "of all thermally excited cooling lines , the 63@xmath1 m line is expected to be the brightest for a large range of disk masses in late - type stars ( g  k ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , in optically thin disks around early - type stars ( f or earlier ) , carbon is expected to be significantly ionized @xcite , boosting the 158@xmath1 m cooling line . finally , if cooling by the and lines saturates ( i.e.  the line fluxes no longer rise with temperature due to the saturated occupation of the excited level , see eq .  [ [ eq : ninx ] ] ) , -cooling may become important .",
    "the 63@xmath1 m and 158@xmath1 m lines both lie within the spectral range of the far - infrared to sub - millimeter _ herschel _ space telescope , scheduled to start science operations in early 2010 .",
    "the telescope has a passively cooled 3.5 m mirror and three instruments pacs , spire , and hifi that together cover the 55672@xmath1 m with both imaging and spectroscopy capabilities .",
    "as such , herschel is well positioned to investigate the tenuous circumstellar disks we are discussing here and partly motivated this study .",
    "predicting the expected luminosity of gas and interpreting potential detections require detailed modeling of the physical circumstances , such as the radiation field from the star , the spatial distribution and content of the gas and dust , etc .",
    "debris disks are known to be dusty with little gas , meaning that the set of assumptions and approximations that can be used are different from other environments , such as the interstellar medium where well - tested codes exist ( e.g.  cloudy , * ? ? ?",
    "debris disks are generally optically thin , which simplifies the radiative transfer and enables modeling of more general three - dimensional distributions with less computational resources . on the other hand ,",
    "a more detailed treatment is required for the thermal balance , as fluorescence is generally important due to the strong radiation field from the star in combination with low gas densities .",
    "this implies computing the statistical equilibrium ( se ) for a large number of energy levels in cooling species .",
    "we have developed a numerical model ontario ( `` optically thin thermal and ionization equilibrium code '' ) to investigate the importance of 63@xmath1 m and 158@xmath1 m fine - structure cooling lines as tracers for gas in dusty but optically thin disks around early - type ( a  f ) stars .",
    "this is intended to complement similar analysis made for later - type stars ( g  k ) by @xcite .",
    "the code takes stellar flux , gas and dust profiles as input parameters and performs self - consistent computation of ionization and thermal balance (  [ sec : thermal ] ) in the disk .",
    "once elemental ionizations and gas temperature have been determined , a full se computation is performed for a number of atomic species to identify the dominant emission and absorption lines .    to test the code",
    ", we use the well - studied @xmath0  pictoris disk as a benchmark case in  [ sec : bpic ] , and compare the numerical model with observed gas disk properties . in  [ sec : fiducial ] , we keep stellar parameters at their @xmath0pic values but replace the gas and dust distributions with more simplified gaussian profiles , and take this configuration as the fiducial debris disk .",
    "fiducial case temperature and ionization profiles are analyzed in ",
    "[ sec : fid_temp ] and  [ sec : fid_ion ] .",
    "we also compute integrated luminosities for the main fine - structure cooling lines (  [ sec : fid_cool ] ) and identify the dominant emission and absorption lines (  [ sec : fid_spectr ] ) . in  [ sec : discussion ] we investigate the dependence of emitted line luminosities on the model parameters , in particular how they scale with disk gas , geometry , mass and composition , and the spectral type of the central star .",
    "conclusions are drawn in  [ sec : conclusion ] .    throughout the paper ,",
    "we adopt the cgs units except where noted .",
    "the ontario model was designed to simulate gas in dusty disks around early - type stars .",
    "the code self - consistently computes the thermal and ionization states of the gas in this environment .",
    "all gas is assumed to be present in atomic or ionized form : the hard radiation fields surrounding these early - type stars rapidly photo - dissociate molecules into individual atoms or ions @xcite ; thus no chemistry computation is included .",
    "ionizations for atomic elements from hydrogen to zinc are considered , up to the second ionization state .",
    "the model assumes both dust and gas to be optically thin , so no complex radiative transfer calculations are performed .",
    "this makes the code effectively zero - dimensional as each bin is treated independently of all others , greatly increasing computational performance .",
    "details of the code , including how ionization and statistical equilibrium is treated , is presented in the appendix . here",
    ", we discuss the main processes that enter the thermal balance .",
    "a number of heating and cooling mechanisms that determine the gas temperature in debris disks have been investigated by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ) and ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ) . observed upper limits on the gas content of debris disks @xcite and theoretical inferences @xcite suggest that gas in debris disk is non - primordial and is depleted in hydrogen .",
    "furthermore , even when assuming solar abundance of hydrogen , it was shown by that heating arising from h@xmath5 collisional de - excitation , photodissociation and formation on dust , as well as cooling from h@xmath5 ro - vibrational lines , are negligible when compared to the photoelectric heating by grains . for these reasons",
    ", we do not include h@xmath5-dependent heating and cooling processes .",
    "we do include , however , the atomic hydrogen contribution to cooling via ly@xmath6 emission at very high temperatures ( @xmath9k ) . also excluded from computation are coolings by vibrational / rotational transitions of molecular co and ch .",
    "these molecular species may arise from evaporating cometary bodies .",
    "however , they are believed to be quickly photo - dissociated around the early - type stars that are the target of this study @xcite .",
    "indeed , _ hst _",
    "uv observations of @xmath0pic failed to detect significant amounts of co in the system @xcite .",
    "relevant heating processes include : photoelectric heating by dust ( pe ) , photoionization of gas by the stellar light ( pi ) , and gas - grain collisions ( gg ) .",
    "the last one becomes a cooling mechanism for the gas when @xmath10 . for @xmath0pic - like disks , have shown that photoelectric ( pe ) heating is by far the dominant heating mechanism .",
    "pe is caused by energetic stellar photons striking dust particles , ejecting electrons from the grains .",
    "released electrons , in turn , contribute their kinetic energy to the gas .",
    "the pe heating rate per unit volume is given by @xcite as @xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    "\\label{eqn : gampe}\\ ] ] here , @xmath13 represents the total dust area per unit volume , coming from grains of radii between @xmath14 and @xmath15 , that stellar photons can intercept .",
    "@xmath16 is the charging potential of the grain , @xmath17 is its work function , @xmath18 is the overall absorption coefficient , @xmath19 is the photoelectric yield , @xmath20 is the stellar flux at a given frequency , @xmath21 is energy of the ejected electrons , and @xmath22 describes their energy distribution .",
    "following @xcite , we take @xmath23 . throughout this paper",
    "we assume a carbonaceous composition for the dust grains , giving a work function of @xmath24ev .",
    "also , @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 and the dimensionless factor @xmath28 is the highly uncertain photoionization yield .",
    "following @xcite , we take @xmath29 each photoelectric electron that makes it out of the grain carries with it an average energy of order @xmath30ev .",
    "the charging potential @xmath16 critically determines the heating capability of stellar photons  only stellar photons with energies above a threshold ( @xmath31 ) yield pe heating . the potential is independent of grain size and",
    "is obtained by equating the photoelectric charging current per unit area on the dust grain , @xmath32 to the thermal electron collection current , @xmath33 here @xmath34 is the electron sticking coefficient , @xmath35 is the electron density , obtained in our code from the ionization balance computation .",
    "@xmath36 is the gas temperature , @xmath37 the electron mass and @xmath38 the stefan - boltzman constant .",
    "[ [ eqn : je ] ] holds for positively charged grains ( @xmath39 ) , which is the case for debris disk gas densities . also ,",
    "as argued by @xcite , the charging potential depends logarithmically on disk parameters like electron density , gas temperature , etc .",
    "@xmath40 depends directly on the area covered by the dust and through eq .",
    "[ [ eqn : je ] ] on electron density @xmath35 . if we take the simplification that each liberated electron carries of order 1ev of energy to the gas ( second integral in eq .  [ [ eqn : gampe ] ] ) , we can estimate @xmath41 ( also see eq . [ [ eq : peguess ] ] ) .    also arising from eq .  [",
    "[ eqn : je ] ] is the dependence of pe heating on gas temperature , @xmath36 .",
    "since @xmath42 is generally a few @xmath43 ( ) , @xmath44 is the dominant term in the equation .",
    "hence , @xmath45 ( and in turn @xmath40 ) @xmath46 . at higher temperatures ,",
    "the coulomb focussing is weakened and electrons are less likely to be collected by the positively charged grains , hence @xmath42 becomes more positive , thus raising the @xmath47 threshold . as a result , the pe heating rate is reduced at higher gas temperatures .",
    "there is no runaway heating .    in practice , the double integrals of eq .",
    "[ [ eqn : gampe ] ] are pre - computed for a range of @xmath16 values . as the integrals are monotonic functions of @xmath16 , the value of @xmath16 is then obtained by equating the pre - computed thermal equilibrium calculation @xmath48 to @xmath45 .",
    "the heating rate per unit volume due to photoionization is @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the energy released per unit time , per unit atom ( @xmath54 ) during photoionization , the subscript @xmath55 denotes the ionization state .",
    "the photoionization rate is precomputed for a given stellar flux and recalled when needed .",
    "we follow atoms h through zn and through to their second ionization states ( see appendix for more details ) .",
    "following bw07 , we ignore drift heating due to differential velocity between gas and grains .",
    "this is justified in our problem where gas and grain are weakly coupled , and is also confirmed by the calculations of @xcite .",
    "when computing gas cooling , we include the fine structure lines 63.2 , 44.1 , 145.5@xmath1 m , 157.7@xmath1 m and 34.8@xmath1 m , the atomic cooling lines @xmath56   and ly@xmath6 , as well as free - free , and radiative recombination cooling .    for gas temperatures below 5000k , , and fine - structure transitions dominate the cooling @xcite . collisionally excited levels decay spontaneously , converting thermal energy to photons that are lost to space , effectively cooling the gas . while both collisions with free electrons and atoms / ions can lead to fine - structure cooling , we neglect the latter since electrons move faster .",
    "let @xmath57 be the population density in level @xmath54 .",
    "for sufficiently high electron densities ( and therefore collision rates ) , each level is populated according to the local thermal equilibrium ( lte ) , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the statistical weight of state @xmath54 , @xmath60 its excitation energy , @xmath61 the total number density of species x , and the summation runs through all energy levels . at lower densities ,",
    "a full statistical equilibrium calculation is required to determine @xmath57 .",
    "the threshold densities ( @xmath62 ) between se and lte are listed in @xcite for various transitions .",
