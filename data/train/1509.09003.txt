    "graphene , a two - dimensional honeycomb - lattice structure of carbon , is intrinsically a zero - gap semimetal@xcite .",
    "its internal binary degrees of freedom such as the valleys , sublattices , and top / bottom layers in multilayers leads to a two dimensional electron gas with valley selective chirality of the electrons near the fermi energy . as a consequence , breaking the spatial inversion symmetry through staggered ab sublattice potentials in graphene , or by applying a vertical electric field in rhombohedral multilayers  @xcite opens up a band gap that embodies a bulk valley - hall effect @xcite which is robust against disorder provided that the k and k@xmath0 valley coupling is weak @xcite . a variety of topologically distinct ground - states result in the presence of valley selective mass terms in the dirac hamiltonian of graphene @xcite and dirac fermion zero energy modes @xcite are expected when the local gap or mass of the dirac hamiltonian changes sign in real space .",
    "these zero modes have been proposed in solitons at domain walls of alternating single - double bonds of the carbon atoms in polyacetylene  @xcite whereas one dimensional ( 1d ) zero - lines of the local dirac gap in real space was proposed in bilayer graphene at regions where the applied perpendicular electric field changes sign  @xcite .",
    "the 1d zero - line modes ( zlm)@xcite due to kinks in the dirac mass are naturally expected in other graphenic honeycomb systems like monolayer graphene  @xcite , graphene superlattices  @xcite , multilayer graphene  @xcite and ab / ba stacking domain at opposite mass honeycomb lattice interfaces @xcite , or tilted multilayer grain boundaries@xcite .",
    "it is expected from theory that these zlms will have special transport properties compared to ordinary 1d channels .",
    "for instance , the analysis of the low energy hamiltonian indicates that the zlms associated with different valleys are time - reversal opposites encoded with opposite chirality that propagate along the same trajectory , and therefore have a substantial spatial overlap that would enhance their mixing in the presence of disorder .",
    "however , analyses based on a realistic tight - binding hamiltonian have shown that the zlms are extremely robust against backscattering for both short and long - range disorder , exhibiting long mean - free paths on the order of hundreds of micrometers for typical magnitudes of disorder strength expected in experiments .",
    "@xcite the reason for this unexpected robustness to backscattering has been attributed to the rather wide spread of the wave - functions across the zero - line that suppresses the backscattering probability , resulting in practically dissipationless transport along any curved zero - line trajectory .",
    "interesting transport features are expected in more complex geometries formed by intersecting zero - lines  @xcite in beam splitter geometries that dictate special current partition laws in transport channels in a network of zlms .",
    "these intersecting zero - line setups can in principle be realized by means of spatially - tunable electric fields in bilayer graphene or by a uniform field in systems with multiple stacking - fault domains  @xcite . despite that the zlms in graphene have been theoretically proposed for several years",
    "the experiments have shown a rather limited progress in their realization until a recent observation and transport measurement of a zero - line in a bilayer graphene deposited on sio@xmath1 displaying a stacking - fault domain wall  @xcite .",
    "it is desirable that the zlm can be designed in a more systematic manner in experiments , and the success in realizing them in gate tunable devices depends primarily on the degree of precision achievable in the alignment of the top - bottom electric gates used to generate the local band gap of bilayer graphene , as well as the achievable quality of the crystal .    in this article",
    "we address the question on the feasibility of experimental realization of zlm in gate tunable devices by providing a detailed account of the adverse effects that can be introduced in the zlms by the misalignment of gates and topological lattice defects . to this end",

    "the dimensions of the scattering region consist approximately of @xmath49 atoms for three different topological defects.,width=321 ]    to summarize this section , we show that zlm can still exist in systems with any kind of the three considered periodic topological defects . for single topological defect , we find that although the 1d propagating behaviour is not altered , the first kind topological defect leads to a significant degradation of the zlm due to its high dependence on the ab sublattice symmetry . on the contrary , the zlms are much more robust against the remaining two topological defects . as a general statement we can conclude that the presence of the topological defects can influence the rate of backscattering of the zlm but barely affects the confinement properties along the 1d zero - line .    .",

    "in summary , we have studied the influence of the device geometries and topological defects on the electronic structure and transport properties of zero - line modes in bilayer and single layer graphene systems .",
    "the analysis of the band evolution of the quantum valley hall edge modes and the zlms in bilayer graphene ribbons show that the edge modes of quantum valley hall effect will develop changing gaps as the ribbon orientation deviates from the zigzag direction , while the corresponding zlms remain all the way gapless except for the armchair direction .",
    "when the bilayer graphene ribbon evolves into the armchair type , the two pairs of zlms become completely mixed and leads to an abrupt opening of a small avoided gap .",
    "the zlms thus show more robustness than the edge modes of qvh states and the valley indices is distinguishable in non - armchair ribbons . to produce high quality zero line modes in bilayer graphene",
    ", the precise alignment of four identical gates are required in traditional device setups .",
    "we provided a theoretical analysis of two practical imperfections in the geometry of real samples : ( 1 ) the in - plane separation distance between the top / bottom gates can not be made arbitrarily small . to date the most achievable value is about 100  nm .",
    "( 2 ) the top gates and the bottom gates can not aligned preciously .",
    "our band structure calculations indicate that both the finite distance and the vertical misalignment of gates will suppress the zlm signal .",
    "specifically , the split distance will introduce localization of bulk states at the band edges and narrow the energy range of zlms and the misalignment between top and bottom gates will induce density imbalance of bound modes and greatly distort the dispersion curves of the zlm . in order to observe the zlms the upper limit of the split distance is about @xmath50  nm for electric controlled bilayer graphene systems    to simplify the experimental preparation we propose an alternative gate setup consisting of two global gates and two local gates . in the new setup",
    "the only adjustable parameter is the in - plane alignment between the two local gates .",
    "band structure calculations show that high quality zlms exist over a broad energy window in our proposed device setup .",
    "we then analyzed the effects of the topological point defects in the zero - line transport .",
    "for this purpose we simulated a single layer graphene system subject to ab staggered potentials in the presence of point defects along the zero - line .",
    "we find that the spatial confinement of the 1d kink states remains largely unaffected by all three types of topological defects and therefore the observability of their local density of states through scanning microscopy probes will not be decreased .",
    "however , the transport properties are affected by enhanced backscattering especially when the point defects eliminate the distinction between the ab sublattices , but the backscattering is not strong for the other types of point defects .",
    "our analysis of gate geometry effects and the relative robustness of the zlm to point defects based on lattice tight - binding and landauer - buttiker transport calculations suggests optimistic prospects for the detection of zlm signals in realistic top - bottom gated devices with currently available gate edge alignment precision on the order of a tens of nanometers .",

    "<S> breaking inversion symmetry in chiral graphene systems , _ e.g. _ , by applying a perpendicular electric field in chirally - stacked rhombohedral multilayer graphene or by introducing staggered sublattice potentials in monolayer graphene , opens up a bulk band gap that harbors a quantum valley - hall state . when the gap size is allowed to vary and changes sign in space , a topologically - confined one - dimensional ( 1d ) zero - line mode ( zlm ) is formed along the zero lines of the local gap . </S>",
    "<S> here we show that gapless zlm with distinguishable valley degrees of freedom k and k@xmath0 exist for every propagation angle except for the armchair direction that exactly superpose the valleys . </S>",
    "<S> we further analyze the role of different geometries of top - bottom gated device setups that can be realized in experiments , discuss the effects of their edge misalignment , and analyze three common forms of topological defects that could influence the 1d zlm transport properties in actual devices . </S>"
