    "ensembles of coupled oscillators are ubiquitous in nature . they arise in diverse areas of science including physics , biology , chemistry , neuroscience , social , electrical and ecological systems .",
    "examples include synchronous emission of light pulses by populations of fireflies @xcite , synchronized firing of cardiac pacemaker cells @xcite , synchronization in ensembles of electrochemical oscillators @xcite , both short- and long - range synchronization in the brain ( within and between neuronal ensembles ) @xcite , emission of chirps by a population of crickets @xcite , and synchronous clapping of audiences in auditoria .",
    "research into the dynamical properties of large ensembles of this kind has been a subject of intense interest since the 1960s @xcite .",
    "mean - field theory facilitates the study of such ensembles by reducing the dynamics of a number of oscillators to the dynamics of their mean field , i.e.  effectively of a single oscillator . in principle",
    ", each oscillator in the ensemble contributes to the dynamics of the mean field , so that the collective dynamics of the entire ensemble can be represented by the dynamics of the mean field .",
    "this approach has a good analytical background that enables identification of bifurcation boundaries and stability criteria for understanding the synchronization dynamics of the ensemble .",
    "although the mean field approach suggests consideration of the dynamics of just one oscillator in place of the ensemble dynamics , recent research has identified new phenomena such as intra - ensemble and inter - ensemble clustering @xcite that can only be understood in terms of ensembles .",
    "thus one should expect to model natural systems comprised of interacting entities as ensembles of coupled oscillators , rather than always approximating them as a single oscillator .",
    "synchronization , or concurrence between oscillatory systems , is a remarkable phenomenon that is often inescapable for coupled oscillators .",
    "phase synchronization was first reported by the dutch physicist chistiaan huygens well back in the 17th century based on his observation of two pendulum clocks that persisted in precise antiphase , seemingly indefinitely .",
    "thereafter , the phenomenon of synchronization has been studied theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite in great detail .",
    "it is well known that the control of synchronization in natural systems @xcite is of great important .",
    "the occurrence of synchronization is very important for e.g.  lasers and josephson - junction arrays @xcite , cardio - respiratory synchronization @xcite or temporal coding and cognition via brain waves @xcite .",
    "however the emergence of synchronized oscillations can also give rise to undesirable effects , as in the case of epileptic seizures @xcite , parkinson s tremor @xcite , or pedestrians on the millennium bridge @xcite .",
    "in real systems , the interactions between the oscillators are often asymmetric .",
    "examples include cardio - respiratory @xcite and cardio-@xmath0 ( eeg ) interactions @xcite , interactions among activator - inhibitor systems @xcite , coupled circadian oscillators @xcite , and the interactions between ensembles of oscillators in neuronal dynamics @xcite .",
    "neglecting coupling asymmetry , i.e.  assuming symmetric interactions , is an approximation that may simplify the analysis but which may also lead to a model that fails to describe important phenomena occurring in the system .",
    "we have already reported @xcite novel global clustering phenomena , and novel routes to inter - ensemble synchronization that occur only in the case of asymmetrically interacting systems .",
    "it is evident , therefore , that explicit consideration of asymmetry in the interaction may be essential to create a realistic model .    in this paper ,",
    "we supplement the preliminary account @xcite of our investigations of two asymmetrically interacting ensembles of oscillators by providing additional detail of the different synchronization regimes , and we extend it by reporting the effects induced by noise asymmetry .",
    "we thereby emphasize the importance of asymmetry  in coupling , noise and phase  in such systems .",
    "we show that it is the coupling and phase asymmetries that control their synchronization .",
    "we also report the occurrence of certain novel routes to inter - ensemble synchronization .",
    "we show that these routes are characteristic of asymmetrically interacting ensembles of oscillators and that they can not occur in systems where the interactions are symmetrical .",
    "these results yield new insights into how synchronization arises in coupled oscillator ensembles .",
    "this understanding is an essential prerequisite for the development of control schemes , paving the way to possible ways of controlling synchronization in real systems .",
    "we introduce the model of asymmetrically interacting ensembles of oscillators , and define their mean field , in sec.[model ] . in sec .",
    "[ stability ] we discuss analytically the stability of the _ incoherent _ ( i.e.  unsynchronized ) state in the thermodynamic limit and consider how it can be modelled numerically .",
    "[ sychregimes ] defines the five distinct synchronization regimes that we have identified , and discusses in turn how each of them is influenced by asymmetry in coupling , noise , and phase .",
    "the several routes followed to synchronization , and between different synchronization regimes , are discussed in sec .",
    "[ routes ] . finally , in sec.[summary ] we summarize the main results and draw conclusions .",
    "the energy emitted or absorbed by an individual oscillator in the ensemble will alter the physical states of the neighbors to which it is coupled ; in particular , the periods of its neighbors are altered ( either lengthened or shortened ) . the way in which the period is altered depends on the state of the neighbouring oscillator at the moment when it receives the impulse .",
    "one of the commonest scenarios to consider is an ensemble of nonlinear oscillators evolving in a globally attracting limit cycle of constant amplitude .",
    "such oscillators are called limit cycle or phase oscillators . if they are coupled in such a way that they will not be perturbed sufficiently to leave their limit cycles , then one degree of freedom is enough to describe the system dynamics .",
    "let us consider a system of two asymmetrically interacting ensembles of oscillators ( aieos ) .",
    "their phase dynamical equations can be written as @xcite @xmath1 the interactions are characterized by coupling parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 to quantify respectively the interactions within ( intra ) , and between ( inter ) , the ensembles ; @xmath4 and @xmath5 are @xmath6-periodic functions that describe coupling in the ensembles .",
    "the fact that @xmath7 implies that the oscillators in the ensembles are asymmetrically coupled .",
    "@xmath8 are the phases of the @xmath9th oscillator in each ensemble and @xmath10 refer to the ensemble sizes ; we take @xmath11 . from eq .",
    "( [ mod01 ] ) , it is obvious that each oscillator will run at its own characteristic frequency @xmath12 when uncoupled .",
    "however when coupled , there tends to arise a collective behavior in the ensemble . depending upon the strength of the coupling parameters , the oscillators either partially or completely synchronize .",
    "the emergence of synchronization is spontaneous beyond a critical value of the coupling parameter .",
    "the @xmath13 are independent gaussian white noises with @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the noise intensities ; @xmath19 represents noise asymmetry .",
    "phase asymmetry is introduced by phase shifts @xmath20 .",
    "the primary effect of the phase asymmetry is to synchronize the oscillators to an entrainment frequency that differs from a simple average of their natural frequencies .",
    "such asymmetry is widespread in natural systems like heart cells @xcite and the cardiorespiratory interactions @xcite .",
    "phase asymmetry is used to model synaptic information and time delays in neuronal networks and also in the phase reduction of nonisochronous oscillators @xcite .",
    "the natural oscillator frequencies @xmath21 are assumed to be lorentzianly distributed as @xmath22 with central frequencies @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the half - width at half - maximum .      when @xmath25 in the thermodynamic limit , each oscillator in the ensemble can be regarded as being coupled to the mean field .",
    "thus for infinitely many oscillators , synchronization can conveniently be defined and characterized by a mean - field ( order ) parameter @xmath26 here @xmath27 are the average phases of the oscillators in the respective ensembles and @xmath28 provide measures of the coherence of each oscillator ensemble , which varies from 0 to 1 .",
    "the amplitude of each order parameters @xmath29 vanishes when the oscillators in the corresponding ensemble fall out of synchronization with each other , and is positive for synchronized states , thus characterizing intra - ensemble synchronization . when @xmath30 constant the ensembles are mutually locked in phase , defining the state of inter - ensemble synchronization .",
    "geometrically , if we consider the phases of all the oscillators to be moving on the unit circle , then the mean field is the centroid of all the phases . with this characterization , we show that an increase of the coupling strength between two ensembles that are synchronized separately does not immediately result in their mutual phase - locking .",
    "rather , phase - locking occurs through either one of two different routes : in route - i the oscillators in the two ensembles combine and form clusters ; in route - ii one of the ensembles desynchronizes while the other remains synchronized .",
    "further , there also exists the possibility that phase - locking between the ensembles can not occur at all .",
    "in the limit @xmath31 , a density function can be defined as @xmath32 , to describe the number of oscillators with natural frequencies within @xmath33 $ ] and with phases within @xmath34 $ ] at time @xmath35 . for fixed @xmath36",

    "the analytic boundary is obtained from the condition @xmath164 and refers to the limit of infinitely many oscillators . for numerics",
    ", the ( asterisked ) boundary is obtained from the condition @xmath165 and refers to a finite number of oscillators .      in this subsection",
    "we focus on the noise - free case with a frequency distribution that has an infinitely sharp peak . in this case",
    ", the dynamics is reduced to that of two ensembles of identical oscillators ( the oscillators within the ensembles are identical while the ensembles themselves are non - identical ) .",
    "now the @xmath101 corresponding to intra - ensemble synchronization can be obtained from eq.([mod01 ] ) as @xmath167.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a linear stability analysis of eq .",
    "( [ mod01 ] ) then gives @xmath168 degenerate eigenvalues for each ensemble , namely @xmath169 that characterize the stability of the intra - ensemble synchronized states of ensembles 1 and 2 respectively .",
    "in addition , two eigenvalues @xmath170 and @xmath171 characterize the stability of inter - ensemble synchronization .",
    "hence the transition between inter - ensemble and intra - ensemble synchronization states occurs at the following bifurcation point @xmath172 note that @xmath101 varies from @xmath173 to @xmath174 as @xmath146 increases . for @xmath175 ( not shown in figures ) ,",
    "the stability condition is satisfied by both ensembles and so intra - ensemble synchronization occurs in both ensembles .",
    "when @xmath176 the stability condition is violated by either one of the ensembles and at that point a hopf bifurcation occurs . as a consequence ,",
    "intra - ensemble synchronization occurs in one of the ensembles . for the case",
    "@xmath177 , when @xmath101 varies from @xmath174 to @xmath178 for increasing @xmath146 and when @xmath176 the stability condition is violated by the first ensemble . on the other hand , when @xmath101 varies from @xmath178 to @xmath173 with increasing @xmath146 , the stability condition is violated by the second ensemble above @xmath179 .",
    "given that the system possesses distinct synchronization regimes , it is of interest to investigate the routes it follows to synchronization .",
    "as one would expect , the route depends on the coupling , noise and phase asymmetries .",
    "in particular , in the presence of coupling asymmetry , we have identified the following routes @xcite , grouped into the two different cases @xmath106 and @xmath180 , and assuming that we increase the inter - ensemble coupling parameter @xmath3 keeping all the other parameters fixed .",
    "when @xmath106 we find that there are at least three typical routes :    1 .",
    "the oscillators in the ensembles pass from the synchronization regime d2 through d1 to the region s1 .",
    "thus when the ensembles are synchronized separately , increasing @xmath3 results in inter - ensemble clustering which then leads to inter - ensemble synchronization or phase locking between the ensembles .",
    "this route is represented by line i - ii of fig .",
    "[ gmp1](b ) .",
    "2 .   there is also a possibility that when the ensembles are synchronized separately and when @xmath3 is increased , the intra - ensemble synchronization be destroyed in one of the ensembles , which on further increase of @xmath3 , leads to phase - locking between the ensembles .",
    "thus when the system is in region d2 increasing @xmath3 causes the system to pass through the region s2 to region s1 .",
    "inter - ensemble clustering does not occur in this route .",
    "if the ensembles are initially not synchronized ( that is in region ns ) , then increasing @xmath3 can cause phase - locking of the ensembles directly .",
    "thus the system can pass directly from region ns to to s1 .",
    "this route is characteristic of the case @xmath106 and can not occur in the presence of phase asymmetry .    in the presence of phase asymmetry ,",
    "i.e.  @xmath180 , the ensembles can follow any of the following routes to synchronization    1 .",
    "the ensembles pass from region d2 through d1 to s1 .",
    "this route is similar to route 1 that occurs for the case @xmath106 .",
    "note that when @xmath177 or @xmath181 only one entrainment frequency exists below @xmath111 and therefore this route does not occur for either cases ( due to the non - occurrence of region d1 ) .",
    "the ensembles pass from region d2 through s2 to s1 .",
    "this route does not incorporate the state of inter - ensemble clustering .",
    "3 .   when the ensembles are synchronized separately ( in region d2 )",
    ", increasing @xmath3 causes the disruption of synchronization in one of the ensembles leading to synchronization in the other ensemble ( region s2 ) .",
    "thus the ensembles pass from region d2 to s2 .",
    "this route is characteristic of phase asymmetry and can not occur for the case @xmath106 .",
    "4 .   if the ensembles are not synchronized , increasing @xmath3 will result in synchronization in either one of the ensembles .",
    "thus the ensembles pass from regions ns to s2 ( unlike ns to s1 in the absence of phase asymmetry ) .",
    "knowledge of these routes to synchronization is obviously important for the control of synchronization in real systems .",
    "one might intuitively suggest that the synchronization phenomena induced by coupling and noise asymmetries could also be obtained by choosing a sufficiently large difference between the mean frequencies of the two ensembles .",
    "however , the synchronization phenomena corresponding to the d1 and s2 regions can only be explained by introducing either coupling or noise asymmetries . as an illustration",
    "let us consider the eigenvalue for the noise - free case without coupling and phase asymmetries for @xmath182 @xmath183 for this case , the intra - ensemble synchronization takes place simultaneously in the two ensembles since the curves @xmath78 and @xmath111 coincide when @xmath184 becomes positive .",
    "although there occur two hopf bifurcations , they happen to be one and the same and hence one will not be able to explain the synchronization region s2 . a similar problem occurs also with the d1 synchronization regime for @xmath185 . therefore we must conclude that the introduction of coupling / noise asymmetries are crucial to account for certain synchronization phenomena and can never be replaced by the introduction of large difference between the mean frequencies of the two ensembles .",
    "it is therefore essential to take account of possible asymmetry while attempting to model natural systems .",
    "certain phenomena , like those discussed here , are attributable to asymmetries in the interactions . in this paper",
    ", we have investigated the role played by coupling , noise and phase asymmetries in two coupled phase oscillator ensembles .",
    "we have identified a global clustering phenomenon that may be characteristic of either the coupling or the noise asymmetry when the other is absent .",
    "phase asymmetry reduces the likelihood of global clustering and also introduces new routes that are characteristic of itself .",
    "thus phase asymmetry controls the routes to inter - ensemble synchronization .",
    "the phenomenon of inter - ensemble clustering that is characteristic of coupling asymmetry is found to occur even for symmetrically coupled systems if noise asymmetry is present .",
    "thus noise asymmetry is found to complement the effect of coupling asymmetry when the latter is absent .",
    "we therefore conclude that , in modeling real systems where synchronization arises , explicit consideration should be given to the effect of possible asymmetries in coupling , noise , and phase .",
