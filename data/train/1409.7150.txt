    "the galaxy distribution in large spectroscopic surveys , such as sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have revealed a complex hierarchical network of structure , called the cosmic web , composed of clusters , filaments , sheets , and voids ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the current paradigm of galaxy formation ,",
    "these structures arise from the linear growth of gaussian density fluctuations in a nearly homogeneous early universe .",
    "dark matter tends to flow out of the voids , accretes onto the sheets , collapses to the filaments , and finally accumulates onto the clusters at the intersections of the filaments . due to the accretion history of the universe ,",
    "the angular momentum of dark matter halos and galaxies are generated and affected by their large - scale environment .    according to the tidal torque theory ( ttt )",
    ", protogalaxies acquire their angular momentum by the asymmetric interaction between their inertia tensor and the local tidal field @xcite .",
    "the galaxy and halo spin directions are expected to be correlated with the principal axes of the local tidal tensor . over the past decades , both numerical simulations and real redshift surveys",
    "have revealed such correlation between halos / galaxies and their local large - scale structure @xcite .    using numerical simulations , @xcite found that halo spin vectors are preferentially aligned with the intermediate axes of the tidal field , which is consistent with the theoretical prediction using the linear tidal torque theory .",
    "similar trends are also claimed from observational data .",
    "based on the real - space tidal field reconstructed from the 2mass redshift survey , @xcite claimed that there is a clear intrinsic alignment between the galaxy spins and the intermediate principal axes of the tidal tensor .    for halos in filaments from n - body simulations ,",
    "recent studies reported a mass - dependence alignment signal between halo spins and filaments .",
    "the spins of low - mass halos tend to be parallel to filaments , while high - mass halos have orthogonal alignment @xcite . for halos in sheets ,",
    "the spin vectors tend to lie in the plane of the sheets , independent of halo mass @xcite .",
    "observationally , the picture is not as clear because of limited statistics and because of the difficulty of properly defining cosmic filaments from observational data .",
    "several studies have endeavored to solve this problem but give partly contradictory results @xcite .",
    "for instance , while @xcite found alignment signals between the spin vectors of galaxies and the surrounding large - scale structures ( e.g. filament and sheet ) , @xcite found no statistical evidence for departure from random orientations . using 2dfgrs and sdss , @xcite found that spiral galaxies located on the shells of cosmic voids have their spins aligned preferentially in the void surface , whereas , @xcite , who used the sdss dr7 and galaxy zoo samples , found that the spins of spiral galaxies around voids tend to be perpendicular to the void surface .",
    "based on sdss dr7 , a recent study by @xcite showed that there is a different alignment between spiral and elliptical galaxies , arguing that the spin of spiral galaxies tends to lie parallel to their host filaments , whereas the spin of elliptical galaxies are aligned preferentially perpendicular to their filaments .    in short ,",
    "observationally the spin alignment with the surrounding large - scale structure is still somewhat contradictory and inconclusive . in our previous paper @xcite , we examined the alignment between the major axes of galaxies and their surrounding large - scale structure .",
    "we found that red galaxies are very significantly aligned with their filaments , while blue galaxies are only marginally aligned with respect to their filaments . in this paper , we investigate the spin vectors of spiral galaxies with respect to the surrounding large - scale environments . here",
    "again we use the galaxy group catalog constructed from the sdss dr7 @xcite .",
    "the cosmic tidal field we used is directly reconstructed from the group catalog using the method described in @xcite .",
    "based on the signs of the eigenvalues of this tidal field , we classify the environments of groups into four categories : clusters , filaments , sheets , and voids .",
    "the morphologies of galaxies used here are those obtained from the galaxy zoo 2 catalog ( gz2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "we measure the spin vectors of spiral galaxies with respect to the principal axes of the local tidal tensor and study how these alignments depend on galaxy properties .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec_data ] , we present the observational data and the methodology used to measure the various alignment signals",
    ". the alignments of spiral galaxies with respect to cosmic web are present in section [ sec_result ] .",
    "we compare the observational results with dark matter halos from n - body simulations in section [ sec_sim ] .",

    "in what follows we describe the observational data we adopt to characterize the cosmic web and measure the alignment between the spin axes of galaxies relative to the large - scale structures .",

    "the continuity over this large area is essential and critical to reconstruct the real - space tidal field from the sdss survey . from the nyu - vagc ,",

    "the smoothing scale @xmath15 is related to the mass @xmath16 contained in the gaussian filter at mean density @xmath17 via @xmath18 , thus a smoothing scale @xmath19 corresponds to the mass @xmath20 .",

    "the direction of a filament at the location of a group can be identified with the eigenvector corresponding to the single negative eigenvalue . likewise , the normal vector of a sheet for a group is the eigenvector corresponding to the single positive eigenvalue of the tidal tensor .",
