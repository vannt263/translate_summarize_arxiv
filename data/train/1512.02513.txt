    "fast radio burst ( frb ) is the name given to a handful of sub - second radio transient signals detected over the last decade  @xcite . because of their many potential uses as tools for studying extreme physical environments and the universe up to redshifts of @xmath0  @xcite",
    ", there is a large effort underway to search for these signals , both in dedicated ongoing surveys and in archival data  @xcite .",
    "frbs manifest themselves as millisecond - duration events with dispersion measures of several hundred @xmath1 .",
    "no frb has yet been observed to emit more than one pulse  @xcite .",
    "rotating radio transient ( rrats ) is the name given to a group of sporadically pulsing sources  @xcite .",
    "the majority of rrats have been seen to repeatedly emit detectable pulses , and it seems clear , from the results of applying pulsar timing techniques  @xcite , that these sources are galactic neutron stars with intermittent and/or highly variable pulsar emission .",
    "single - instance rrat pulses are no different in appearance to frb pulses .",
    "the criterion for deciding whether such pulses should be classified as frb or rrat is comparison of the dispersion measure ( dm ) with the predicted galactic maximum of this parameter . in this paper , in   [ sec : ne2001 ] , we examine the uncertainty in this classification . then , in   [ sec : rrat_or_frb ] , we estimate the probability that various transients are galactic or extragalactic , before presenting our concluding thoughts in   [ sec : last_section ] .",
    "the parameter used in deciding whether a dispersed radio burst is an frb , i.e. extragalactic , is @xmath2 , the maximum galactic dm contribution for the particular line of sight .",
    "if the burst s dm exceeds @xmath2 then it is extragalactic , an frb , with an inferred @xmath3gpc - scale distance .",
    "if the burst s dm is less than @xmath2 then the source is galactic , a rrat , with an inferred @xmath3kpc - scale distance . in practice the model used",
    "has thusfar always been ne2001  @xcite ; more specifically `` ne2001b '' as per the labelling of @xcite . here",
    "we investigate the uncertainty of this model , and thus the uncertainty in the rrat / frb classification of dispersed radio bursts which have not been seen to repeat .",
    "there are a number of studies in the literature which have addressed the question of the accuracy of the ne2001 model for predicting distances .",
    "@xcite used distances to @xmath4 pulsars , determined from vlbi and pulsar timing measurements of parallax , to estimate the distribution of distance errors of the model .",
    "more recently , @xcite identified and corrected the lutz - kelker bias in the by - then enlarged sample of pulsar distance measurements derived from parallax , supernova remnant associations and neutral hydrogen absorption . taking the @xmath5 sources in @xcite with dm measurements ( i.e. those detected at radio wavelengths ) we produce a lutz - kelker corrected version of the distance error distribution of @xcite , shown in figure  [ fig : ne2001_dist_errors ] .",
    "an overestimate ( underestimate ) of the distance corresponds to an underestimate ( overestimate ) in the dm inferred _ at the correct distance _ , and correspondingly an overestimate ( underestimate ) in @xmath6 .",
    "thus the distribution of the ne2001 distance errors maps directly to ne2001 @xmath7 errors , i.e. rrat / frb classification .",
    "we can see that the distribution is skewed , with overestimates more likely with a ratio of @xmath8 . however , there is evidence of latitude dependence in the distribution . considering only those pulsars within @xmath9 degrees of the galactic plane",
    "the ratio of underestimated : overestimated distances is @xmath10 , but is @xmath11 for sources that are more than @xmath9 degrees from the plane . assuming that finer resolution in galactic latitude would see an insufficiently large sample for further resolution , below we consider only these three distributions in estimating the accuracy of rrat / frb labelling .",
    "a search of the literature ( see table  [ tab : ne2001_dist_errors ] for references ) shows that there are @xmath12 sources labelled as rrats , which have never been seen to show a second radio pulse . in table",
    "[ tab : ne2001_dist_errors ] these are considered in addition to the 16 published frbs .",
    "the probability that each of these events is extragalactic is tabulated , for each of the three distributions of ne2001 errors discussed above : derived from ( i ) the entire @xcite sample ; ( ii ) the @xmath13 degrees sub - sample ; and ( iii ) the @xmath14 degrees sub - sample . based solely on this simple assessment of ne2001 uncertainties ,",
    "frb classifications seem to be mostly sound , with perhaps one source being of uncertain progeny : frb  010621has a @xmath15 probability of being extragalactic . of the ` rrat ' sources , j1354@xmath1624 appears to have the highest likelihood of being a mis - labelled frb , with a probability of @xmath17 of being extragalctic .",
    "additional outside information can be used to build upon these estimates , where it is available .",
    "for example while one might argue the lack of scattering in frb  010621favours an extragalactic origin  @xcite , identifying a galactic explanation for frb  010621has been the subject of investigation by @xcite and @xcite , the latter suggesting that ionised gas unaccounted for in ne2001 can explain much or all of the excess dispersion .",
    "another key piece of additional information is the limit on repeatability . for frb  121102 ,",
    "@xcite suggest the observed spectrum , which is dramatically positive , is not intrinsic and a result of a far side - lobe detection . @xcite",
    "suggest the observed spectrum is an effect of free - free absorption in a nebula surrounding an extragalactic magnetar . in both scenarios",
    "the @xmath18 hours of followup may be insufficient to rule out underlying repetition .",
    "obtaining key additional information like this will be essential to elucidate the origins of sources like j1354@xmath1624 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have considered the uncertainty in the dm excess parameter @xmath6 , crucial in rrat / frb classifications in high time resolution radio surveys of the sky . by considering a simple probability - based estimator ,",
    "we have determined that the frb identifications made so far are reasonably secure with perhaps one exception ( frb  010621 ) . on the other side of the clasification",
    ", we find the ` rrat ' j1354@xmath1624 has a @xmath19 chance of being a mis - labelled frb ; this suggest it merits a deep observational study to address the question of whether it repeats .",
    "similarly , the cumulative probability of at least one rrat being mis - labelled is at the @xmath20 level ; a dedicated campaign to search for a second pulse from each of these sources is merited .",
    "a further concern is a potential bias in the reported single pulse events . in pulsar and transient surveys",
    "it is standard practice to consider a source to be a _ bona fide _",
    "astrophysical source only when it has been observed on at least two epochs  @xcite .",
    "this rule , coupled with finite available observing time for re - observing pulsar and transient candidates , continues to contribute to the difficulty in identifying those intermittent pulsars and rrats with the longest repetition timescales  @xcite .",
    "however , this rule is not applied to frbs : they are simply reported when detected .",
    "given this , and that much more observing time is spent closer to the galactic plane  @xcite we suspect a galactic - latitude dependent bias in the reported events .",
    "to enable correction for this effect survey teams should report single pulse events which appear to be of astrophysical origin , regardless of whether they are seen on a second epoch or have @xmath21 .",
    "probability - based classifiers could then be used for determining the galactic / extragalactic nature .",
    "the observed frb rate at parkes  @xcite is higher at higher latitudes . with a perfect electron density model and no reporting bias ,",
    "such a dependence can still arise , as a result of eddington bias of the population due to diffractive scintillation at high latitudes  @xcite . in this scenario",
    "the true rate is that at low latitudes , and the ` boost factor ' depends directly on the @xmath22 distribution  the steeper the distribution the larger the boost .",
    "but it is clear that the difference between the observed and intrinsic rates , and hence in our ability to uncover the true @xmath23 and luminosity distributions , is a combination of a number of effects . in this paper",
    "we have tried to tackle the effect of the uncertainty of ne2001 . with this , and a clear picture of single epoch pulse events , including those with @xmath21 ( most , but perhaps not all , will be within our galaxy ) , we will be able to determine trustworthy metrics for determining the cosmic history of frbs , whether or not they are standard candles , and their general utility as tools for precision cosmology .",

    "macquart , for valuable input that improved the quality of this paper ."
