    "the baryonic content of clusters of galaxies is dominated by the metal - rich , x - ray luminous intracluster medium ( icm ) that pervades the cluster potentials .",
    "x - ray observations permit precise measurements of the x - ray luminosities and temperatures ( @xmath6 ) of clusters , which can be related to the masses of these systems . for self - similar clusters with a characteristic density that scales as the mean density of the universe , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the redshift of formation of the cluster ( e.g. kaiser 1991 ; evrard & henry 1991 ) .",
    "since the bolometric luminosity is dominated by bremsstrahlung emission at x - ray wavelengths , we can then show that @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the mass fraction in x - ray gas .",
    "( the redshift dependency holds for an einstein - de - sitter universe and is modified for lower values of @xmath11 ; eke , navarro & frenk 1997 ) . in principle , studies of the @xmath12 relation may be used to examine the evolution of clusters and should , for example , enable the range of cluster formation redshifts to be estimated ( scharf & mushotzky 1997 ) .",
    "it is well known that the observed @xmath12 relation for clusters contains a significant intrinsic dispersion . within the simple theoretical framework outlined above",
    ", this dispersion should relate to the ages of the clusters .",
    "however , such simple models do not account for important physical processes that could effect the x - ray properties of clusters and , in particular , the effects of radiative cooling .    in the central regions of most ( @xmath13 per cent ) clusters , the cooling time of",
    "the icm is significantly less than the hubble time ( edge 1992 ; peres 1997 ) , which leads to the formation of cooling flows ( fabian 1994 ; allen & fabian 1997 ) .",
    "fabian ( 1994 ) showed that clusters with cooling flows are offset in the ( @xmath14 kev ) @xmath15 plane such that they have lower temperatures for a given luminosity ( or alternatively higher luminosities for a given temperature ) . before concluding that cooling - flow clusters are simply older than non - cooling flow systems , however , one must account for the effects of the cooling gas on the x - ray properties of the clusters .",
    "cooling flows can account for up to 70 per cent of the total x - ray luminosity of a cluster ( peres 1997 ; allen 1998 ) and contain gas with a wide range of densities and temperatures",
    ". a spectral fit to a cooling - flow cluster with a simple isothermal model will yield only a mean emission - weighted temperature that will be reduced with respect to the virial value .",
    "evidence for this effect was presented by allen , fabian & kneib ( 1996 ) , from a study of the nearby , luminous cooling - flow cluster pks0745 - 191 .",
    "these authors showed that explicitly accounting for the effects of the large cooling flow in this cluster leads to an x - ray determined mass value in excellent agreement with gravitational lensing measurements , but as much as a factor 3 greater than the mass inferred from a simple single - temperature x - ray analysis .",
    "allen ( 1998 ) presented results for a larger sample of clusters and showed that for all of the cooling flow clusters in that sample the virial temperatures , determined from multiphase x - ray analyses which accounted for the effects of the cooling flows , were significantly higher than those inferred from simple single - temperature models and lead to consistent x - ray and lensing mass measurements .",
    "a second issue relating to the @xmath12 results is the slope of the relation , which appears to fit @xmath16 ( edge & stewart 1991 ; david 1993 ; fabian 1994 ) rather than @xmath17 , as would be expected for simple gravitational collapse .",
    "this again suggests the absence of important physics from the models .",
    "one well - discussed possibility is that of pre - heating ( kaiser 1991 ; evrard & henry 1991 ) in which energy sources such as stars , supernovae and agn pre - heat the gas in the subclumps that merge to form present - day clusters .",
    "more recently , cavaliere ( 1997 ) have shown that accounting for the effects of shocks in cluster formation ( with plausible levels of pre - heating ) can lead to @xmath18 at intermediate x - ray luminosities , although at the highest luminosities the relation should flatten to @xmath19 .    in this letter",
    "we use the results from multiphase analyses of asca spectra and rosat high resolution imager ( hri ) data , for a sample of thirty of the most x - ray luminous known clusters ( with @xmath1 ) , to examine the effects of cooling flows on the @xmath12 relation .",
    "we show that explicitly accounting for the effects of cooling flows leads to a significant flattening of the slope of the relation , to a value @xmath20 , in agreement with the theoretical predictions . throughout this letter ,",
    "we assume @xmath21=50 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "0.2truein    0.2truein    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      the bolometric luminosities and x - ray temperatures for the clusters determined with the isothermal spectral model ( a ) are plotted in fig .  1 .",
    "@xmath24 has been adopted as the ordinate since this variable has the dominant statistical errors .",
    "( the statistical errors on the luminosities are negligible . )",
    "the wide dispersion in the @xmath25 plane is evident and is much greater than the average statistical error bar on the temperatures .",
    "the cf clusters clearly lie below the ncf objects .",
    "we have fitted the @xmath25 data with power law models of the form @xmath26 , using both standard @xmath27 and the akritas & bershady ( 1996 ) modification of the ordinary least squares statistic ( referred to by those authors as bivariate correlated errors and intrinsic scatter or bces ) .",
    "the results are summarized in table 2 .    with the temperatures and luminosities for the cf clusters corrected for the effects of cooling flows ( using spectral model c )",
    ", the @xmath0 relation appears more uniform ( fig .",
    "2 ) . the mean weighted variance about the best - fitting bces curves drops from 2.22 kev@xmath28 , using model a for all clusters , to 1.09 kev@xmath28 , when using model c for the cf systems .",
    "a further significant reduction in the dispersion is obtained by modelling the subsamples of cf and ncf clusters separately . for the cf clusters , the mean weighted variance about the best - fitting ( bces )",
    "curve is 0.98 kev@xmath28 using model a , and 0.46 kev@xmath28 using model c , indicating a significant improvement to the power - law fit when accounting for the effects of the cooling flows .",
    "( this improvement is also reflected in the @xmath27 values listed in table 2 ) .",
    "for the subsample of ncf clusters , the mean weighted variance about the best - fitting curve is only 0.24 kev@xmath28 .",
    "( we note that at least part of the residual offset between the cf and ncf clusters in fig .",
    "2 can be attributed to the effects of subcluster merger events in the ncf clusters , which will disrupt their core regions and reduce the central x - ray gas densities and luminosities by up to a factor of @xmath29 . )",
    "the most remarkable change to the @xmath0 results upon correcting for the effects of the cooling flows is in the slope of the relation . using the simple isothermal model ( a ) for all clusters we obtain @xmath30 ( using the bces estimator ) , in general agreement with the results from previous studies ( edge & stewart 1991 ; david 1993 ; fabian 1994 ) .",
    "using spectral model c for the cf clusters , however , the best - fitting slope determined from a fit to the whole sample is steepened to @xmath31 .    examining the subsamples of cf and ncf clusters separately , we obtain for the ncf clusters @xmath32 ( bces using spectral model a ) , with a marginally acceptable value for the reduced @xmath27 of 16.8 for 7 degrees of freedom .",
    "the high - luminosity ncf clusters thus maintain the slope determined from studies of lower - luminosity systems . for the cf clusters , using spectral model",
    "a we find @xmath33 ( bces ) , with an unacceptable @xmath27 of 1062 for 19 degrees of freedom .",
    "using spectral model c for the cf clusters , however , the slope is steepened to @xmath34 and the @xmath27 value substantially improved to a marginally acceptable value of 38.5 .",
    "our results demonstrate that accounting for the effects of cooling flows on the x - ray properties of the clusters steepens the @xmath0 relation ( or conversely flattens the @xmath12 relation ) . in particular , for the cf clusters",
    "the corrected @xmath12 relation is consistent with @xmath19 , in agreement with the simple models outlined in section 1 .",
    "we note that this result is not dominated by the extreme cluster rxj1347.5 - 1145 , which has the largest statistical uncertainty associated with its temperature and , therefore , a low weight in the fits .",
    "we have searched for biases in the results by splitting the clusters into two subsamples , with bolometric luminosities less than and greater than @xmath35  ( using spectral model c for the cf clusters ) .",
    "the fit results for the two subsamples show excellent agreement with each other and with the results for the sample as a whole .",
    "the slopes of the relations are not significantly altered if the @xmath14 kev x - ray luminosity rather than the bolometric luminosity is used .",
    "( this is not surprising since the bolometric luminosity of a hot , x - ray luminous cluster is dominated by the contribution in the 2 - 10 kev band . )",
    "we note , however , that the @xmath0 relation for the ncf clusters is further flattened ( the @xmath12 relation is steepened ) if spectral model b rather than model a is used for these systems if the absorbing column density is included as a free parameter in the isothermal spectral analysis .",
    "[ we have used model a , in preference to model b , for our analysis of the ncf clusters because it provides temperature results in better agreement ( where such a comparison is possible ) with the results from previous x - ray experiments which were less sensitive to the precise column density values ( _ c.f . _ david 1993 ) . for a more detailed discussion of the merits of the individual spectral models",
    "see allen ( 1998 ) . ]",
    "a comparison of our results with those of david ( 1993 ) shows that our best - fitting relation , accounting for the effects of the cooling flows , under - predicts the observed cluster temperatures at @xmath36 by @xmath37 kev .",
    "although the @xmath0 values for the lower - luminosity clusters will also be adjusted once the effects of their cooling flows have been accounted for ( this will be presented in future work ) the effects are unlikely to be sufficient to bring the lower - luminosity data points into agreement with the slope extrapolated from the high luminosity clusters .",
    "this implies that the @xmath0 relation is not a simple power - law across all luminosities but flattens at lower @xmath38 values ( the @xmath12 relation steepens ) .",
    "our results for clusters with @xmath39 are in good agreement with the predictions of cavaliere ( 1997 ) and support the suggestion that pre - heating of the icm significantly effects the x - ray properties of ( only ) lower - luminosity clusters .",
    "finally , we note that our results argue against the suggestion of david ( 1993 ) that the @xmath40 relation , determined from simple isothermal spectral analyses , may be reconciled with @xmath19 if the x - ray gas mass fraction , @xmath10 , correlates with the x - ray temperature as @xmath41 .",
    "the results on @xmath10 and @xmath24 plotted in fig.3 have a best - fitting power - law slope of @xmath42 ( using the bces orthogonal distance estimator ) , albeit with significant scatter .      within the simple theoretical framework outlined in section 1",
    ", we may expect clusters that have formed earlier to have a lower normalization in the @xmath0 plane .",
    "we have examined the evidence for evolution in the @xmath2 data by splitting the clusters into two subsamples with redshifts less and greater than the mean value of @xmath43 .",
    "this gives 16 clusters with @xmath44 and 14 with @xmath45 , with an approximately even mix of cf and ncf systems in the two subsamples ( 5 and 4 ncfs the low and high redshift subsamples , respectively ) .",
    "the mean redshifts for the low@xmath46 and high@xmath46 clusters are 0.14 and 0.29 , respectively .",
    "4 shows the @xmath25 data for the two subsamples ( using spectral model c for the cf clusters ) . using the low@xmath46 clusters as a calibrator ( feigelson & babu 1992 ) we determine an offset between the high@xmath46 and low@xmath46 systems such that the normalization of the high@xmath46 subsample is a factor of @xmath47 higher than that for the low@xmath46 clusters .",
    "we thus find no evidence for significant evolution in the @xmath0 relation over the range of redshifts covered by our study .",
    "the results presented in this letter demonstrate that our understanding of the physics within clusters , and in particular the effects of radiative cooling , must be improved before definitive statements about the origin and evolution of clusters can be made from the @xmath0 relation .",
    "ncf clusters generally show evidence for recent or ongoing merger events , that have disrupted their central x - ray gas distributions and lead to apparent conflicts between x - ray and gravitational lensing mass measurements for these systems ( allen 1998 ) .",
    "in contrast , optical , x - ray and gravitational lensing studies of cf clusters show these systems to be regular and dynamically - relaxed and to exhibit excellent agreement between their x - ray and lensing mass measurements ( allen 1996 ; allen 1998 ) .",
    "we conclude that the x - ray data for cf clusters , corrected for the effects of cooling flows , should provide an accurate measure of the virial properties of these clusters , and the best basis for comparisons with theoretical models .",
