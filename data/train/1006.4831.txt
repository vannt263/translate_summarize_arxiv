    "in his nowadays classical studies on the kinetic theory of gases , the danish physicist m. knudsen experimentally observed that , no matter how an inert gas was injected into a pipeline , the direction in which a molecule rebounds from the pipeline s solid wall is asymptotically independent of its initial trajectory .",
    "that is , the fraction of particles leaving the surface in a given direction is proportional to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the angle that such a particle s trajectory defines , measured with respect to the normal to the surface ( @xcite ) .",
    "this behaviour is referred to as the * _ knudsen s ( cosine ) law _ * ever since . in the experiment ,",
    "the gas is injected at a very low pressure so that interactions between particles are negligible .",
    "the physical justification of knudsen s law is the following .",
    "first of all , one assumes that particles bounce at the pipeline s wall _ elastically_.",
    "this means that the energy of a particle is preserved in a collision which , in turn , implies the _ refection law _ : the angle that the incident direction forms with the normal to a surface , @xmath2 , equals the angle @xmath3 of the reflected direction , @xmath4 .",
    "it has been proved that this law is valid in a first approximation if we do not take into account thermal effects . since we also assume that particles do not interact with one another",
    ", we must conclude that the microscopic irregularities on the pipeline s surface are responsible for the destruction of any particular pattern in the original gas distribution . indeed , even if we assume that the bounces are perfectly elastic , microscopic holes in the boundary of the pipeline and imperfections in relief are dimensionally comparable to the molecules of the gas and have therefore a disruptive ( i.e. , unpredictable ) effect on particle collisions : after many bounces , we are in the so - called _",
    "knudsen s regime _ in which the reflected direction is independent of the incident one .",
    "however , this argument does not explain by itself why the reflected angles are distributed according to the",
    "_ cosine law_. the theory of _ billiards _ helps clarify this point ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the irregularities of the pipeline surface can be reasonably modelled as cavities or microscopic cells with a dispersive geometry such that , once a particle has entered one of them , it comes out of it with a rather arbitrary direction , even if all the collisions inside that cavity are elastic . if the pipeline is made of a uniform material , we can model one such cell as a billiard table and the pipeline wall as an infinite row of such billiard tables that a particle moving freely enters and exits . with this description , knudsen s cosine law",
    "can be then seen as a consequence of the fact that , for sufficiently dispersive billiard geometries , the liouville measure is the unique measure preserved by the billiard flow ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "unfortunately , this need not be the case for polygonal ( i.e. , non - dispersive ) tables such as fig . [ fig pipeline ] .",
    "so polygonal geometries require a slightly different approach .    since the characteristic size of this cell is infinitely small compared with the diameter of the pipeline , the exact position along the open side of the cell ( dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig pipeline ] ) at which the particle enters a cell coming from the previous one is considered to be randomly distributed with uniform probability . following @xcite , we will refer to these billiards as _",
    "random billiards_. more concretely , the dynamics of a particle bouncing inside the pipeline are given by the _ first return map _ to the open side of a the billiard cell , which defines a markov process .",
    "thus , the dynamics are characterised by a transition operator @xmath5 such that , for any reflected direction @xmath6 $ ] , @xmath7 is the probability that a molecule takes a direction in @xmath8 $ ] after the next rebound .",
    "these concepts will be reviewed in sections [ section preliminaries ] and [ section random billiards ] . in this formalism",
    ", knudsen s law can be mathematically written as follows .",
    "let @xmath9 be the initial angle distribution with which the gas is injected into the pipeline .",
    "that is , if @xmath8 $ ] , @xmath10 represents the proportion of particles that will hit the pipeline s wall for the first time with an incident angle @xmath11 .",
    "denote by @xmath12 the distribution after @xmath13 collisions . in this context",
    ", knudsen s cosine law can be expressed in two different ways .",
    "the * _ strong knudsen s law _ * claims that , for almost any initial distribution @xmath9 , after many collisions @xmath12 converges to the cosine distribution , @xmath14 . \\label{eq strong law}\\ ] ] on the other hand , the * _ weak knudsen s law _ * states that if , after any collision , we count the number of particles reflected with a given angle @xmath1 and then divide by the total number of particles , this quantity is proportional to @xmath15 .",
    "explicitly,@xmath16 obviously ( [ eq strong law ] ) implies ( [ eq weak law ] ) , so the strong knudsen s law implies the weak one .",
    "deterministic dynamical systems can be sometimes understood as idealizations of _ real _ systems , the latter usually subjected to negligible perturbations in a first approximation .",
    "the use of a dynamical approach to study a gas is one such example . in this paper",
    ", we will study the properties of the random billiard obtained as a result of modelling the rough surface of the pipeline by a zig - zag geometry as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig pipeline ] .",
    "our billiard cell is an isosceles triangle with open side @xmath17 defined by an angle @xmath18 .",
    "this model was introduced in @xcite but has not been studied in depth yet . for example , in @xcite nothing is said about the ergodic properties of this billiard table when @xmath19 ( it is shown that it is not ergodic under the liouville measure if @xmath20 though ) . thus it is not at all clear if the dynamics resulting from a random billiard as in fig .",
    "[ fig billiard table ] will in fact follow knudsen s law ( weak or strong ) .",
    "in this paper , we will prove that it is actually the case .",
    "more concretely , the main contributions of our paper are the following :    1 .",
    "little is known about the ergodicity of the flow of deterministic billiards given by irrational polygon tables ( @xcite ) .",
    "remarkably , we show that , for a concrete example , randomising the billiard in a sensible way ( i.e. , choosing the point at which the particle enters the billiard randomly but uniformly distributed on one side of the table ) implies its ergodicity and exactness with respect to the liouville measure . 2 .   unlike other attempts to prove ( weak ) knudsen s law , where one usually assumes very irregular geometries at a microscopic level responsible for the dispersive effects",
    ", we deal with an extremely simple pattern .",
    "this has additional advantages as a simpler model capturing the main features of a system can be simulated and developed more easily .",
    "3 .   in the literature ,",
    "ergodicity of random billiards relies on the ergodicity of the first return map ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we use here a different approach and take advantage of a skew - type representation of random maps recently introduced in @xcite .",
    "the techniques used to prove the exactness of our model can be certainly adapted to study other ( random ) billiard tables and random maps in general .",
    "finally , we prove that the strong knudsen s law holds for our model . as we mentioned before",
    ", even if one assumes dispersive billiard geometries , one will only prove that the first return map is ergodic , i.e. , the weak law .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section [ section model ] we introduce the random billiard behind our model .",
    "we recall some basic definitions and properties of billiards in section [ section preliminaries ] and the concept of random billiard in section [ section random billiards ] . in section [ section random maps ]",
    ", we review the skew - type representation of random maps introduced in @xcite and show the relationship between this representation and the dynamical evolution of absolutely continuous measures .",
    "we prove that this skew - type representation is exact in section [ section exactness of s ] , which uses some auxiliary results presented separately in section [ section ergodicity of ss ] .",
    "finally , in section [ section knudsen s law ] , we illustrate our results with numerical simulations .",
    "suppose we have a gas of non - interacting particles moving freely inside a pipeline .",
    "our model consists of a two dimensional infinite pipeline whose rough walls are modelled as a sequence of cells built as a juxtaposition of a _ fundamental cell _ ( fig .",
    "[ fig billiard table ] ) . in this section",
    ", we are going to fix the geometry of such cell and introduce the main hypothesis behind the dynamics of the particles .",
    "the content of this section is extracted from @xcite .",
    "both the geometry and dynamics of our model are summarised in figure [ fig pipeline ] .",
    "we assume that the walls of the pipeline are not smooth but describe a serrated regular pattern built from a fixed isosceles triangle with an open side .",
    "we characterise that triangle by one of its angles @xmath21 .",
    "the dynamics of a particle moving freely inside the pipeline are as follows : the particle enters one of the cells with some angle @xmath2 and bounces on its sides elastically , that is , according to the reflection law .",
    "the particle eventually comes out of the cell with a given direction @xmath22 , then crosses the pipeline , and reaches another cell on the opposite wall , and the process recurs . since the diameter of the pipeline is several orders of magnitude bigger than the characteristic length @xmath17 of the cell , it is plausible to think that , every time the particle enters a new cell through the open side , it does so at a point uniformly distributed on @xmath17 .        in the literature ,",
    "one encounters examples of particle dynamics on bounded domains where the random perturbation is introduced in the observations of @xmath22 every time the particles bounces off the wall ( see for example @xcite ) , which implies that collisions are no longer elastic .",
    "this perturbation is explained as a consequence of the roughness of the wall .",
    "observe that , in our model , randomness is introduced in a completely different way .",
    "we assume elastic collisions but , instead of considering dispersive geometries responsible for the random bounces , the noise is introduced in a sensible way without modifying the ( rather elementary ) geometry of the problem .    the trajectory that a particle describes after it comes out of a billiard cell until it enters another one on the opposite wall is completely irrelevant for dynamical purposes .",
    "in practice , we can better understand our dynamical system as the closed billiard table obtained by fixing together two triangular cells so that they share the same open side as in figure [ fig billiard table ] .",
    "when the particle crosses that open side , it retains its direction but it is assigned a different position on @xmath17 according to a uniform law .     at a uniformly distributed random point.,width=377,height=181 ]    the * _ incoming angle _ * @xmath2 ( resp . *",

    "this section aims at recalling the main concepts of the theory of ( deterministic ) billiards and one of its key results , namely , that the _ billiard map _ preserves the liouville measure .",
    "the content of this section was extracted from @xcite , which the reader is referred to for an exhaustive exposition on billiards .    a * _ billiard table _ * @xmath34 is the closure of a bounded open domain @xmath35 whose boundary @xmath36 is a finite union of smooth compact curves ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) .",

    "this condition prevents the wall @xmath41 from having inflection points or line segments . a wall such that @xmath44 is called * _ focusing _ * or * _ dispersing _ * if @xmath45 points inwards or outwards @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "otherwise @xmath46 and the wall is called * _ flat_*. in this framework , we consider the dynamics of a point particle moving freely within @xmath34 .",
    "let @xmath47 denote the position of a free particle moving within a billiard table .",
    "we suppose that the particle bounces at @xmath48 * _ elastically_*. that is , if it collides with the wall @xmath49 at a point @xmath50 that is not a corner , the incident angle @xmath2 that the velocity @xmath51 forms with the normal vector @xmath13 to @xmath49 at @xmath50 equals the angle of reflection @xmath3 between @xmath13 and @xmath51 after the collision , i.e. @xmath4 .",
