    "laser spectroscopy is a main research tool to study electronic states of materials , across research fields ranging from atomic physics to cellular biology . in modern optics ,",
    "nonlinear behavior of a medium is of primary interest , often studied with multiple laser fields which spatially overlap . in such cases , the presence of a strong control laser field makes it challenging to extract the signal from a weak probe field , in particular when further constraints enforce co - propagation of these fields . in practice",
    "one can not always rely on spectral or polarization filtering ( for example in cryogenic measurement volumes @xcite ) and in these cases low - frequency intensity modulation combined with lock - in detection techniques provides a means to separate a signal from co - propagating fields .",
    "such modulation techniques , otherwise known as _ optomodulation spectroscopy _",
    "@xcite , also improve the signal to noise ratio @xcite , as signals become less sensitive to external light and @xmath0 noise sources .    with this modulation technique applied to a nonlinear medium ,",
    "the susceptibilities as seen by the control and probe fields become time dependent .",
    "this yields cross - modulation , where modulation of the incident intensity of one field influences the transmitted intensity of another field , giving rise to so - called differential transmission signals .",
    "notably , for this paper the notion of differential transmission refers to this slow modulation of a susceptibility with continuous - wave lasers , effectively comparing two different steady - state conditions .",
    "the modulation timescale is orders of magnitude slower than the intrinsic electronic dynamics of the medium ( that can be directly studied in pump - probe experiments with ultrafast pulsed lasers @xcite , sometimes called _ transient differential spectroscopy _ ) .",
    "low - frequency intensity modulation has already been applied in a variety of optical experiments with differential signals from transmission , reflection or luminescence .",
    "textbooks on nonlinear spectroscopy qualitatively discuss the benefits of studying crosstalk signals from modulation techniques in saturation spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "generically , the advantages lie in enhancing the visibility of weak transitions , and it was applied in experimental work on quantum wells@xcite , donor centers in semiconductors @xcite , quantum dots @xcite , and other atomic - like systems @xcite .",
    "however , a detailed analysis of the differential signals is mostly not presented , despite the fact that this is essential for optimal design of these experiments , interpretation of the results , and insight into systematic errors that may occur .",
    "we present here an analysis of the signals from differential transmission spectroscopy ( dts ) on a medium with three - level lambda systems , based on both model calculations and experimental results .",
    "we show how dts can dramatically enhance the spectroscopic visibility of weakly absorbing transitions , and how this enhancement depends on the involved optical dipole moments .",
    "we also investigate how the method can provide quantitative information about these dipole moments ( which are key ingredients if one also wishes to unravel the combined dts signal from two co - propagating fields into the separate transmission components ) .",
    "further , our analysis shows how in two - laser experiments ( where one laser is fixed and one is used for spectroscopic scanning ) choosing which laser is modulated makes a key difference for being robust against unintentional intensity variations in the applied fields .",
    "similarly , we show how the spectroscopic lines of a transition can show an apparent frequency shift .",
    "we show quantified results for this shift and describe the best approach for minimizing this systematic error .",
    "the relevance of our analysis is demonstrated with spectroscopy experiments on donor - bound exciton centers in si - doped insulating gallium arsenide .",
    "while our experiments and part of our calculations thus focus on one particular material system and experimental arrangement , the analysis and methods that we present here are of generic value for spectroscopy experiments on media with multi - level systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : simu ] presents simulations of dts on a three - level lambda system medium .",
    "we introduce a model to calculate differential signals and describe it both at the macroscopic scale of the measurement setup and in terms of the microscopic electron dynamics .",
    "subsequently , this model is used to analyze the benefits of differential transmission and how possible disadvantages can be minimized .",
    "section  [ sec : expsigaas ] provides experimental results of dts on silicon donor centers in gallium arsenide , demonstrating the effects described by our model .",

    "if the probed medium has nonlinear components in the susceptibility , _ i.e. _ the susceptibility depends on the presence of laser fields , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are in general not equal .",
    "consequently , the transmittance of the constant field is time - dependent with frequency @xmath2 in the form of amplitude modulation of its transmission .",
    "this transfer of amplitude modulation from one field to another via the susceptibility will be called cross - modulation , and the contribution of the constant field to the transmission at frequency @xmath2 will be called differential transmission . the frequency component at @xmath2 of the total transmitted power",
    "thus consists of two parts and is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) is the power of the modulated ( constant ) field , and where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are incident on the medium while @xmath22 is measured after the medium .",

    "<S> we analyze theoretically and experimentally how nonlinear differential - transmission spectroscopy of a lambda system medium can provide quantitative understanding of the optical dipole moments and transition energies . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the situation where two optical fields spatially overlap and co - propagate to a single detector . </S>",
    "<S> nonlinear interactions give cross - modulation between a modulated and non - modulated laser field , yielding differential transmission signals . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows how this approach can be used to enhance the visibility of relatively weak transitions , and how particular choices in the experimental design minimize systematic errors and the sensitivity to changes in laser field intensities . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , we demonstrate the relevance of our analysis with spectroscopy on the donor - bound exciton system of silicon donors in gaas , where the transitions from the two bound - electron spin states to a bound - exciton state form a lambda system . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is , however , of generic value for many spectroscopy experiments on solid - state systems in small cryogenic measurement volumes where _ in - situ _ frequency or polarization filtering of control and signal fields is often challenging . </S>"
