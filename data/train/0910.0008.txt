    "cosmological probes of neutrinos are therefore complementary to direct experiments and provide some of the tightest constraints on both the number of relativistic species present in the early universe and the sum of neutrino masses @xcite . however , up to date , these constraints were dependent on the assumed cosmological model .",
    "for example , bounds on the sum of the neutrino masses could be relaxed by , for example , allowing coupling in the dark sector @xcite or allowing hadronic axions @xcite . in this paper",
    "we summarize how cosmic neutrinos affect cosmic history , examine how recently improved cosmological measurements of the low redshift universe can help constrain these neutrino properties , and scrutinize the impact of our assumptions about the cosmological model .    in the standard model for particle physics",

    "as @xmath22 is extremely well constrained , @xmath20 can be used to constrain neutrino properties ; deviations from @xmath19 would signal non - standard neutrino features or additional relativistic relics .",

    "these constraints rely on physics at the time of big - bang nucleosynthesis ( @xmath25 mev ) , and in several non - standard models the energy density in relativistic species can change at later time ( e.g. at the last scattering , @xmath26 ev ) .",
    "free - streaming relativistic particles affect the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) through their relativistic energy density , which alters the epoch of matter - radiation equality , and through their anisotropic stress @xcite .",

    "massive neutrinos suppress the linear power spectrum , but because @xmath35 corresponds to the mass scale to which maxbcg is most sensitive , the impact of the alteration in power spectrum shape is minimal on the final constraints . in principle , massive neutrinos also alter growth in the nonlinear regime . ref .",
    "@xcite shows that power suppression is enhanced in the nonlinear regime for massive neutrinos , implying that the upper bound reported in the present paper is robust .",
    "therefore , since the range of total neutrino mass we explore in this paper is well below @xmath55 ev , we can safely apply the maxbcg constraint . in the case of massive neutrinos",
    ", we also study the maxbcg constraint in combination with wmap5 for a @xmath2cdm model including spectral index running .",
    "when we evaluate the spectral index @xmath56 for all @xmath57/mpc from the wmap5 constraints in this model , the value falls between @xmath58 and @xmath55 for 68% of the time .",
    "this range satisfies the stated maxbcg tolerance to variation in the spectral index , and therefore we may apply the maxbcg constraint unaltered in the models we study including massive neutrinos .",
    "the maxbcg analysis did not directly address models in which @xmath24 is varied .",
    "however , we have verified that within the space of parameters allowed by wmap5 and the @xmath9 constraint of @xcite in a @xmath2cdm+@xmath24 model , the impact of @xmath24 on the shape of the linear power spectrum can be compensated by a change in @xmath59 that is within the maxbcg stated tolerances .",

    "the mcmc chain we produce for the the dark coupling model of @xcite uses the same parameters , but replaces @xmath63 with the parameter @xmath64 , the ratio of the approximate sound horizon to the angular diameter distance , which is used by cosmomc @xcite .    for a more `` frequentist '' statistic ,",
    "the profile likelihood can be computed from the mcmc chain @xcite .",
    "since we have 7 or more uninteresting parameters and only one parameter for which we want to report constraints ( say , @xmath65 ) , for each value of @xmath65 we find the maximum likelihood value @xmath66 , regardless of the values assumed by other parameters .",
    "we then consider @xmath67 as a function of the model parameter @xmath65 , or function thereof ; here @xmath68 is the maximum likelihood over the entire chain .",
    "we examine the profile likelihood for both @xmath34 ( section [ profilelike ] ) and @xmath24 ( section [ neffprofilelike ] ) .",
    "as long as the posterior distribution is singly peaked , this profile should be independent of the bayesian priors ; but note that the profile likelihood will become noisier as @xmath69 decreases , since the mcmc method means the chains do not densely sample low @xmath69 regions .",

    "we now consider constraints on the effective number of neutrino species : in this case we assume that neutrino masses are negligible and in the analysis we keep @xmath34 fixed to @xmath88 . while in principle both @xmath11 and @xmath34 should be varied simultaneously , in practice the two",
    "are no longer degenerate , and so the assumption @xmath12 does not change the constraints much @xcite .",
    "equation [ zequal ] defines the major degeneracy between @xmath11 and @xmath27 in the wmap5 data . with the strict assumptions of a @xmath2cdm cosmology",
    ", the measured angular diameter distance can only be recovered if @xmath9 varies with @xmath11 , while the @xmath45 and @xmath133 constraints do not relax when @xmath11 is allowed to vary .",
    "this explains the strong degeneracy between @xmath11 and @xmath9 in the wmap5 posterior distribution .",
    "there is also a weaker degeneracy between @xmath11 and @xmath59 .",
    "while wmap5 tightly constrains the amplitude of fluctuations on very large scales , @xmath134 mpc@xmath40 , within the wmap5 degeneracy and assuming a power law primordial spectrum , the allowed linear @xmath109 pivots about @xmath62 as @xmath11 varies , so that the amplitude of power near the peak at @xmath135 mpc@xmath40 ( and beyond ) increases with @xmath11 .",
    "this tilt causes the degeneracy between @xmath11 and @xmath35 , and can be constrained both by measuring the galaxy power spectrum shape and constraints on the cluster mass function .",
    "finally , since @xmath45 and @xmath133 are both tightly constrained , the variation of @xmath9 with @xmath11 induces a degeneracy between @xmath11 and @xmath136 .",
    "this could be probed through gas fractions in clusters or eventually through the amplitude of the bao signal in large scale structure data .",
    "these well - defined one - dimensional degeneracies would degrade in a less - restricted model of the expansion history , so that further geometrical constraints would be needed to constrain @xmath11 and other parameters like @xmath7 and @xmath6 simultaneously .",
    "figure [ fig : h0vsneff ] shows the degeneracies in the wmap5+@xmath129 posterior distribution between @xmath11 and both @xmath9 and the maxbcg - constrained parameter @xmath70 ; the results are qualitatively the same when the @xmath129 constraints are excluded .",

    "both the maxbcg and updated @xmath9 measurement reduce the error on @xmath11 significantly in all three cases . when both of these constraints are taken together , additional data sets other than wmap5",
    "do not shift the mean value of @xmath11 or reduce its error : @xmath138 . therefore the maxbcg and @xmath9 constraints are sufficient to break the key degeneracies in the wmap5 data in this model . since the geometrical constraints from bao and sn",

    "@xcite result that the posterior of @xmath11 only approaches a gaussian distribution when several datasets are combined . in figure",
    "[ fig : profilelikenrel ] this skewness is evident in the profile likelihood for @xmath163 .",
    "a gaussian provides a reasonable fit to the profile likelihood only when both @xmath9 and maxbcg constraints are included .",
    "therefore , the `` frequentist '' constraints reported in the lower half of table [ table : neff2 ] are only meaningful for the last column , which includes @xmath9 and maxbcg constraints . in that case",
    ", there is good agreement with the bayesian 95% confidence interval .",
    "table [ table : neffother ] shows constraints on @xmath11 from other data in the literature . while wmap5 provides robust evidence for a lower bound on @xmath11 , by itself it can not provide an upper limit .",
    "the strong correlation between @xmath11 and @xmath9 in the @xmath2cdm model makes direct probes of @xmath9 and @xmath111 the most effective way to constrain @xmath11 with low redshift observations .",
    "the new hst constraint clearly provides a significant improvement over wmap5 in combination with previously available geometrical constraints ( wmap5+bao+sn+hst ) .",
    "the additional constraints on the expansion history from @xcite improve even further , with the wmap5+@xmath9 error on @xmath11 of 1.0 being reduced to 0.5 with the combination wmap5+@xmath9+@xmath111 .",
    "the ly-@xmath107 constraints are also quite promising as a probe of the power spectrum amplitude at large @xmath100 , but should be reevaluated with the new data and in the context of the possible systematics .",
    "comparison of measured isotope abundances with bbn calculations provide still the tightest and completely independent constraints on @xmath11 .    [",

    "in this paper we have demonstrated that probes of the cluster mass function and increased precision on the hubble constant can break key degeneracies with cmb observations and yield excellent constraints on both the number of species and sum of the masses of cosmological neutrinos .",
    "when the expansion history is fixed to @xmath2cdm , current constraints on @xmath9 @xcite and the cluster mass function @xcite constrain @xmath3 ev at 95% confidence . this bound relaxes to 0.5 ev in the two extended models we considered : wcdm , and the dark coupling model of @xcite , which allowed curvature , @xmath6 , and coupling strength @xmath8 to vary . probing the mass function using x - ray clusters , ref .",
    "@xcite combines x - ray cluster data with wmap5+bao+sn and finds @xmath102 ev in a @xmath6cdm cosmology , though the systematic errors still must be clearly quantified .",
    "the optimistic upper bound available from current data , @xmath164 ev , almost excludes the scenario in which the neutrino masses are quasi - degenerate .",
    "the constraint on the number of relativistic species @xmath11 from probes of the cluster mass function has not been widely explored so far .",
    "we find that the combination of wmap5 , @xcite @xmath9 , and the maxbcg cluster mass function constraint provides an excellent constraint : @xmath138 .",
    "however , we point out that this constraint does not improve when bao and sn data are also included ; those data sets have been shown to have excellent constraining power on both @xmath7 and @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we may expect that the constraint on @xmath11 will not relax dramatically if we allow for these additional parameters but include all of these datasets , particularly because of the complementarity of the growth of structure and expansion history constraints we have employed .",
    "these constraints are not competitive with the most optimistic errors from bbn @xcite , but provide an important consistency check using probes significantly after the bbn epoch .",
