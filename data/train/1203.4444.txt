    "one important feature of quantum mechanics is the superposition principle .",
    "this fundamental characteristic for pure states can be summarized by the quantum entanglement phenomenon @xcite .",
    "it is believed that such a property can give to the quantum world the advantage of processing information in a more efficient way than its classical counterpart @xcite . however , in a realistic scenario , decoherence destroys the superposition of states leading the system state to a statistical mixture @xcite .",
    "a number of methods has been proposed to circumvent this difficulty ; among them we highlight the quantum error - correcting codes @xcite , decoherence - free subspaces in collective systems @xcite , and dynamical decoupling methods @xcite . differently from the methods cited above",
    ", the engineering reservoir technique @xcite makes use of incoherent control of markovian reservoirs to drive the system state to a desired superposition of pure states in the asymptotic limit @xcite .",
    "therefore , the effective interaction between the system and reservoir must be carefully engineered to drive the system to equilibrium with the reservoir .",
    "recently this theme received a great deal of attention in order to obtain pure entangled protected states @xcite .",
    "besides the recent generalization of the engineering reservoir technique to protect nonstationary superposition states @xcite , two important applications of this technique have emerged : ( i ) the construction of robust quantum memories @xcite and ( ii ) the implementation of quantum computation via dissipation ( qcd ) @xcite . in the former case",
    "the quantum information can be stored for long times at the nodes of a quantum network , while in the later case the quantum processor is insensitive to external perturbations or decoherence .",
    "particularly , in ref . @xcite it was shown that qcd is universal and can efficiently simulate a given quantum circuit .",
    "one of the clearest demonstration of the power of quantum processing is the quantum solution for the deutsch problem @xcite .",
    "later improved by deutsch and jozsa @xcite and by collins , kim , and holton @xcite , the optimized version of the deutsch algorithm is able to decide wheter a binary function is constant or balanced with a single measurement , while in the classical case two measurements are required .",
    "the deutsch problem was proved using different experimental setups , such as nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite , optical systems @xcite , circuit quantum electrodynamics architectures @xcite , trapped ions @xcite , the nitrogen - vacancy defect center @xcite , and quantum dots @xcite .    in this work",
    "we investigate the protection of superposition states in a physical system composed by two asymmetric quantum dots coupled by tunneling under the application of laser fields , where the interplay of the optical field and the tunneling creates a structure of two excitonic levels : direct and indirect , as described in ref .",
    "the results obtained here generalize the result obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a robust state of the indirect exciton was found . through the protection of an arbitrary coherent superposition of the ground and excited ( indirect exciton ) states",
    ", we propose the implementation of the optimized version of the deutsch algorithm @xcite using qcd . in general , the proposals for implementing quantum computing protocols make use of coherent control of quantum systems . in contrast , our proposal to solve the deutsch problem has the advantage of being controlled incoherently by the reservoir , becoming immune to decoherence processes .",
    "the manuscript is divided as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we obtain analytically the protected asymptotic state of the system which is parametrized on the bloch sphere .",
    "such a state is used to solve the deutsch problem in sec .",
    "conclusions and perspectives for this work are presented in sec .",
    "iv . in the appendix",
    "we deduce the effective master equation leading to the protected state .",
    "we consider two asymmetric quantum dots coupled by tunneling , which under the application of a static electric field along the growth direction can be simplified to a three - level system @xcite : the ground state @xmath0 ( no excitation on the system ) , the exciton state @xmath1 ( one electron - hole pair in the same dot ) , and the indirect exciton state @xmath2 ( the electron in one dot and the hole in another ) . the exciton state can be created from the ground state by the application of a laser field with right the frequency and the indirect exciton from the exciton state by tunneling of one electron , as experimentally demonstrated in ref .",

    "we tune the gate voltage to have @xmath8 and @xmath9 . @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the frequency and phase of the laser field , respectively .",
    "@xmath12 is the dipole coupling between the excitonic transition , with @xmath13 being the electric dipole moment and @xmath14 the incident electric field of the laser @xcite .",
    "according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the dominant decoherence processes can effectively be described by spontaneous emission from states @xmath1 to @xmath0 and @xmath2 to @xmath15 with decay rates @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "this approximation remains valid if we consider that ( i ) the system is at very low temperatures so that the pure dephasing induced by acoustic phonons does not modify significantly the system dynamics @xcite ; ( ii ) the creation of the lower energy exciton state is made by the application of a resonant laser field , which inhibits transitions mediated by phonons @xcite ; ( iii ) the optical phonon effects are negligible because they have quite different frequencies ( @xmath18 mev ) compared with that of our system ( see the main text ) @xcite .",

    "note that the eigenvector @xmath53 is composed only by @xmath54 states",

    "@xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) @xmath73 : in the opposite scenario where @xmath74 the protected asymptotic state is the ground state of the system @xmath75 .",

    "the control of the laser relative phase @xmath11 will enable us to implement the deustch algorithm , as shown below .",

    "differently from the original solution to the deutsch problem @xcite , which is probabilistic , we present here a deterministic algorithm due to collins , kim , and holton @xcite . besides being deterministic , the approach to the deutsch problem used in ref .",
    "@xcite is interesting because only one query to the oracle is made and auxiliary qubits are unnecessary .    to implement the deutsch algorithm we use the protected state @xmath82 with the laser phase @xmath11 being @xmath83 or @xmath84 . in order to clarify the execution of the algorithm",
    ", we make the correspondence between the function domain @xmath85 and the states of the system @xmath86 so that @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "we define next the parameter @xmath89 , which can take the values @xmath90 .",

    "the oracle is the laser phase @xmath11 programmer .",
    "the last part of an algorithm is the readout of the solution .",
    "this is made here , first , by replacing the current laser field by another one with amplitude @xmath98 , relative phase @xmath99 , and frequency @xmath100 resonant to the transition @xmath101 . in this new configuration",
