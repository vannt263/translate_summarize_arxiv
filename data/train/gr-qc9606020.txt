    "scheel , shapiro and teukolsky@xcite have numerically shown that oppenheimer - snyder collapse in brans - dicke theories of gravity produces black holes that are identical to those of general relativity in the final stationary stage , but behave quite differently during dynamical evolution .",

    ", however , they found that there are some initial epochs in oppenheimer - snyder collapse during which not only the apparent horizon passes outside the event horizon , but also the surface area of the event horizon decreases in time .",
    "thus , the area increase theorem for black holes in general relativity does not hold in brans - dicke theory . as mentioned briefly in ref .",
    "@xcite , these different behaviors are possible because the null convergence condition , i.e. , @xmath3 for all null vectors @xmath2 , is violated for a dynamical black hole in brans - dicke theory . at the present paper , we investigate how the behavior of the auxilliary scalar field @xmath4 in brans - dicke theory causes this violation and the oscillatory behavior of the surface area in detail",
    ".    one may think that the violation of the area theorem for black holes in brans - dicke ( bd ) theory causes some problem to the black hole thermodynamics in bd gravity since the black hole entropy in einstein gravity is propotional to the surface area of the horizon and so the area theorem automatically serves as the classical second law in black hole mechanics .",
    "we show that there exists a certain quantity defined on the event horizon which never decreases during any classical process in bd gravity . moreover , this quantity coincides with the entropy in the case of stationary black holes in bd theory .",
    "thus , the black hole thermodynamic second law in bd theory is established . since bd theories of gravity are dynamically related to other theories of gravity such as higher curvature theories of gravity and dilaton gravity , the results for black holes in bd theory also give some insights for those in other theories of gravity .    in sec .",

    "let us consider the change of the total surface area of the horizon of any black hole along the null congruence of the horizon generators orthogonal to the spacelike cross - section @xmath6 : = _ h d^2x = _ hd^2x ( ) [ darea ] where @xmath7 is the affine parameter of null geodesics whose tangents are @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the expansion of the horizon generators .",
    "one can easily see that , if @xmath10 everywhere on the horizon and at any point in @xmath7 , @xmath11 and so the surface area is non - decreasing always . otherwise , it either still increases or decreases depending on the value of integration of @xmath12 over the whole event horizon@xcite .",

    "it , therefore , shows @xmath11 proving the area theorem : _ the total surface area never decreases in any classical process . _    for black holes in einstein gravity ,",
    "the null convergence condition is equivalent to the null energy condition since field equations are r_ab - rg_ab=8gt_ab . for black holes in bd gravity , however , @xmath20 becomes _ indefinite _ as follows ; _ bd = ( r- _ a^a)+l_matter .",

    "in other words , @xmath5 is initially positive near the unit . now",
    "the question is whether or not there is a cauchy surface in the future evolution where the field @xmath5 passes zero and becomes negative .",
    "as can be seen in field equations ( [ feqbd ] ) , it implies a curvature singularity unless the total energy - momentum tensor on the right hand side cancels this singular behavior .",
    "therefore , @xmath80 corresponds to a naked singularity on the event horizon or outside the horizon , violating the assumption of cosmic censorship in bd theory which we used in the proof . to see whether the dynamics of the field @xmath21 can prevent this singular behavior ,",
    "let us examine the relationship between bd theory @xmath67 and einstein gravity @xmath79 .",
    "in the theory @xmath79 , @xmath87 corresponds to @xmath88 . in general , the dynamics of the field @xmath89 is determined by the potentials coming from couplings with matter lagrangian as well as @xmath73 .",

    "since @xmath95 could be negative in general , the potential could fall exponentially , leading to @xmath96 and so @xmath80 .",
    "as far as we know , however , we have not found any physical system in the literature which shows vanishing of @xmath5 .",
    "numerical simulation for the case of oppenheimer - snyder collapse in fig .",
    "[ phibd ] also shows that the scalar field @xmath5 is always positive during its evolution .",
    "finally , let us extract some general feature of the proof shown in sec .",
    "one of the most important behaviors of expansion @xmath12 used in proving many global properties of spacetime such as singularity theorem and area theorem is that @xmath12 reaches @xmath18 within some finite affine parameter if @xmath12 is negative at some point and convergence condition(i.e .",

    "[ bhabdt ] briefly .",
    "in general relativity the convergence condition is satisfied if some suitable energy condition for matter fields is assumed . in other theories of gravity , however , this is not true any more as seen , for instance , in sec .",
    "[ bhabdt ] .",
    "thus , it is not clear whether or not some global theorems in general relativity or modified forms of them where the convergent behavior of @xmath12 is used for proof still hold in other theories of gravity . in this paper we have shown that a modified  expansion \" @xmath40 plays the same role as @xmath12 under same energy conditions for matter fields .",
    "for example , one may define a modified  trapped \" surface as a compact , two dimensional , smooth spacelike surface where all  ingoing \" and  outgoing \" null geodesics orthogonal to it have negative @xmath40 , instead of having negative @xmath12 .",
    "in fact , for bd theory , this @xmath40 is nothing but the expansion in the conformally related einstein frame with an overal multiflication factor .",
    "however , the general feature of the proof in this paper may still be applicable to other class of gravity theories which are not conformally related to einstein gravity .",
    "in addition , it also gives some hints on investigating how robust many global properties of spacetime in general relativity are under the change of dynamics of gravitational fields .",
    "in other words , by using the convergent behavior of @xmath40 , we may extend the validity of many global results in general relativity to other theories of gravity as done for the area theorem in this paper .",
