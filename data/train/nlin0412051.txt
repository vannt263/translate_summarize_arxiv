    "in the past few years , there has been a dramatic increase of interest in the behavior of solitary waves and intrinsic localized modes ( ilms ) in dynamical lattices ; see e.g. , @xcite for a number of recent reviews .",
    "one of the key reasons for this focus of interest has been the ability of such modes ( which are ubiquitous in nonlinear lattice models ) to localize the energy and transfer it in a targeted way @xcite .",
    "an additional , related feature of these modes is the important role they play in the conduction of heat ( or equivalently transport of energy ) along such dynamical simple lattices and how this relates to fundamental macroscopic laws of thermodynamics such as fourier s law of heat conduction ; see e.g. , @xcite for a recent review .",
    "another application may be found in modelling the deformation and fracture behaviour of continuous structured media with internal degrees of freedom .",
    "some initial model equations in this direction can be found in @xcite .    on the other hand , an increasingly important theme in nonlinear physics concerns the interplay between nonlinear dynamics and geometry , especially in lattice settings .",
    "the relevant contexts vary from long - range interactions on a fixed curved substrate @xcite , to substrate - feedback models @xcite and coupled atomic chains @xcite , and from junctions between lattices with different masses @xcite to semi - circular polymer - like chains @xcite and models of geometrically nontrivial dna @xcite .",
    "the unifying principle in all these situations is that the geometry can significantly affect the static properties of excitations in the lattice ( e.g. , multi - stability ) , as well as dynamical ones ( e.g. , a variety of outcomes in the interaction of intrinsic localized modes with curvature ) .",
    "motivated by these two emerging themes of nonlinear lattice dynamical systems , we propose in this work a mechanical example , in which even though the underlying interactions of the system consist of _ linear _ springs , the geometry renders the interactions nonlinear .",
    "this , in turn , leads to complex features of the straightforwardly realizable ( in a mechanical experiment ) system at hand .",
    "such examples are manifested in the coherent structures of the system ranging from the familiar kinks to the more exotic rotobreathers @xcite ( or other structures such as domain walls or kinks with embedded defects @xcite ) .",
    "they are also evident in the resonant energy transport features of the model that relate the energy conduction with the moving intrinsic localized modes ( ilms ) that are present in the model ( see below ) .",
    "we touch upon each of the above aspects to give a flavor of the rich and diverse properties that such a `` geometrically - induced nonlinearity '' model is endowed with .",
    "the mechanical example that we examine consists of masses ( `` beads '' ) that slide on _ fixed _ rings of radius @xmath0 ( even though the radius can be variable from ring to ring , we will here consider it to be fixed ) .",
    "furthermore , the centers of the rings are at distance @xmath1 between them . the chain of beads moving azimuthally along their respective rings is coupled through linear , elastic strings of a natural length @xmath2 ; see fig .",
    "[ dfig1](a ) for a schematic .",
    "there are two interesting subcases .",
    "the rings can be in the same plane or they can be in different planes . while the latter case is also of interest ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to the former ( coplanar rings ) in what follows .",
    "then , @xmath3 and the distance between adjacent particles is given by : @xmath4 the model hamiltonian for linear , elastic interactions reads : @xmath5 .",

    "the resulting equations of motion read : @xmath10 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & l_0 l \\sin(\\theta_n ) \\left(\\frac{1}{r_{n , n+1 } } - \\frac{1}{r_{n-1,n } } \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & - & l_0 \\left ( \\frac{\\sin(\\theta_{n+1}-\\theta_n)}{r_{n , n+1 } }                   - \\frac{\\sin(\\theta_{n}-\\theta_{n-1})}{r_{n-1,n } } \\right ) , \\label{eqofmotion}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath11 $ ] . for convenience ,",
    "we introduce the notation @xmath12 .",
    "_ ground states . _ the model of eq .",
    "( [ eqofmotion ] ) supports numerous complex structures ( a number of which we will examine below ) , but there are only three types of the ground state structures bearing a very simple form .",
    "the parameter space @xmath13 is naturally divided into three regions , depending on the corresponding types of ground state structure .",
    "we now summarize these structures ( see also fig . [ dfig1](b ) ) .    for @xmath14 , we are in regime i , where the lowest energy structure is @xmath15 for constant @xmath16 .",
    "note that from static considerations , structures with any @xmath16 are in indifferent equilibrium , but in the presence of dynamic perturbations , only structures with @xmath17 are stable .",
    "the physical origin of the instability for @xmath18 can be easily understood considering the situation with all particles being at rest with @xmath19 and one particle oscillating with a finite amplitude near the equilibrium position .",
    "taking into account higher order anharmonic terms , one can demonstrate an asymmetry in the torques acting on the particle with respect to deviation from the right versus deviation from the left .",
    "this asymmetry gives rise to the force driving the particle toward the closest stable position , namely @xmath20 or @xmath21 , where the symmetry is restored .",
    "there are two more symmetric structures corresponding to @xmath22 and @xmath23 , but they are unstable",
    ". to illustrate this issue , for the chain of @xmath24 particles , we set the initial conditions @xmath25 , @xmath26 , with different magnitudes of @xmath16 and @xmath27 being a random number homogeneously distributed on @xmath28 $ ] . in fig .",
    "[ dfig1](c ) we plot the time evolution of @xmath29 .",
    "one can see that there are two stable positions ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) with respect to dynamic fluctuations .",
    "we thus restrict our considerations to the stable equivalent structures , @xmath17 . in this case , the dispersion relation reads : @xmath30 in the limit @xmath31 , the linear spectrum collapses to a single point ( in this case @xmath32 ) .",
    "such geometrically induced limits where the linear spectrum collapses to a single point for all @xmath33 are an interesting feature of the present model ( see below ) and will be called _",
    "purely anharmonic _",
    "( pa ) limits , as the harmonic linear part of the spectrum is eliminated in this case .",
    "this is a situation that bears some resemblence to the anti - continuum limit of models of ilms @xcite .",
    "regime ii is defined by @xmath34 , where structures of the form : @xmath35 , \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\sin^2\\phi=\\frac{l_0 ^ 2-l^2}{4 } , \\label{type2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] have zero energy ( all springs have their natural length ) ; @xmath36 . in this case , the linear spectrum is of the form : @xmath37 which for @xmath38 becomes @xmath33-independent ( pa limit ) , @xmath39 . the spectrum of eq .",
    "( [ spectrum2 ] ) vanishes at @xmath31 which is the border between the type i and type ii regimes .    finally , regime iii consists of the natural lengths such that @xmath40 , when the ground state structure is @xmath41 in this case , the linear spectrum is given by @xmath42 one can see that for @xmath43 , the width of linear spectrum vanishes ( pa limit ) , @xmath44",
    ".    having discussed the ground states , we now give representative examples of the interesting nonlinear behavior that is possible in each of the regimes highlighted above .",
    "regime i supports an interesting rotobreather with one rotating particle .",
    "such an example is shown in fig",
    ". [ dfig2](a ) , where the particle @xmath45 rotates with angular velocity @xmath46 at @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "we show the stroboscopic picture of motion with intervals @xmath49 ( where @xmath50 is the period of the solution ) .",
    "particles with positive and negative @xmath51 are practically at rest at their respective positions .",
    "the neighbors of @xmath45 particle can be at rest in the positions where the averaged ( over a period ) torque acting from the moving particle is equal to zero . for a large rotobreather frequency ,",
    "the angular velocity of the @xmath45 particle is almost constant and , hence , the averaging over time can be substituted by averaging over angle @xmath52 .",
    "thus , an approximate rotobreather solution can be given as follows : @xmath53 i.e. , the 0th particle moves with constant angular velocity @xmath54 while all other particles are at rest at the positions defined through the angle @xmath55 , which is a root of @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the torque acting on the particle @xmath58 from the neighboring particles under the assumption that @xmath59 and @xmath52 is arbitrary . while the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ integral ] ) with @xmath60 lead to unstable configurations , the root lying in the interval @xmath61 leads to a stable rotobreather which very accurately captures our numerical findings ( see the caption of fig .",
    "[ dfig2](a ) ) .    note that in the case of roto - breather presented in fig .",
    "[ dfig2](a ) , dynamic fluctuations are absent .",
    "introduction of such fluctuations would result in the appearance of a weak forces driving the particles with @xmath62 to the position @xmath63 and particles with @xmath64 to the positions with @xmath65 [ see fig .",
    "[ dfig1](c ) ] .",
    "an equilibrium state in this case would look similar to what is presented in fig .",
    "[ dfig2](a ) only in the vicinity of the roto - breather , but more distant particles would approach the positions which are stable against dynamic fluctuations .",

    "the asymmetry in the displacements of particles renders this structure less tractable analytically",
    ". we will give a very simple analytical approximation for the ilms ( standing and moving ) in regime iii where the displacements are symmetric .",
    "however , we believe that the mechanism of ilm propagation in the regime ii is the same as in the regime iii , i.e. , the relay - like resonant energy exchange between particles .",
    "_ standing and moving ilms . _ regime iii supports ilms which , depending on model parameters , can be moving or standing .",
    "we have also found that the existence of standing ilms precludes the existence of moving ones and vice versa . to better understand this phenomenon we first solve an auxiliary problem of resonant energy transfer and then give some simple analytical estimates for standing and moving ilms .",

    "equation ( [ eqofmotionsmal ] ) does not take anharmonicity into account .",

    "the dynamics of the chain with one forced particle differs qualitatively for hard and soft anharmonicity . for @xmath94 , when the free particle has maximum amplitude , it oscillates in phase with the forced particle , and its amplitude excceeds @xmath89 in the resonance regime while for @xmath93 it does not because the particles oscillate out of phase . in other words , efficient inter - particle energy exchange occurs only for hard anharmonicities . for the chain with soft anharmonicity ,",
