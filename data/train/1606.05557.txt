    "one possible approach to motivating a geometrical theory of gravity is to compare the geodesic equation of differential geometry with newton s force law .",
    "this suggests the identification of the gravitational forces with the components of the christoffel symbols which in turn yields the identification of the gravitational potentials with the metric . assuming a geometrical framework with a metric compatible covariant derivative without torsion gives the building block of einstein s theory of general relativity",
    ", one can speak of the metric approach .    soon after the original formulation of this geometrical theory of gravity , it was noted that there exits an alternative geometrical formulation which is based on a globally flat geometry with torsion .",
    "the key mathematical result to this approach goes back to weitzenbck who noted that it is indeed possible to choose a connection such that the curvature vanishes everywhere .",
    "this formulation gives equivalent field equations to those of general relativity and we refer to this as the teleparallel formulation .",
    "this naming convention stems from the fact that the notion of parallelism is global instead of local on flat manifolds , see for instance @xcite and reference therein .",
    "one of the basic equations of general relativity and its teleparallel equivalent is @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the ricci scalar , @xmath2 is the torsion scalar and @xmath3 is a total derivative term which only depends on torsion . clearly",
    ", the einstein - hilbert action can now be represented in two distinct ways , either using the ricci scalar or the torsion scalar , and consequently giving identical equations of motion .",
    "a popular modification of general relativity is based on the lagrangian @xmath4 and can be viewed as a natural non - linear extension that results in fourth order field equations @xcite . on the other and , one could consider the lagrangian @xmath5 which gives second order field equations @xcite . however , this theory is no longer invariant under local lorentz transformations because the torsion scalar @xmath2 itself is not invariant @xcite .",
    "neither is the total derivative term @xmath3 but the particular combination @xmath6 is the unique locally lorentz invariant choice , see also  @xcite .",
    "hence , @xmath4 gravity and @xmath5 gravity and not equivalent and correspond to physically different theories .",
    "now , considering the more general family of theories based on @xmath7 one can establish the precise relationship between these theories and it turns out that @xmath4 gravity is the unique locally lorentz invariant theory while @xmath5 gravity is the unique second order theory .",
    "the principal aim of this paper is to extend these results to take into account the gauss - bonnet term and its teleparallel equivalent .",
    "the gauss - bonnet scalar is one of the so - called lovelock scalars @xcite which only yields second order field equations in the metric , hence in more than four dimensions the study of the gauss - bonnet term is quite natural . in four dimensions , on the other hand ,",
    "the gauss - bonnet term can be written as total derivative and its integral over the manifold is related to the topological euler number .",
    "however , it should be emphasised that topological issues in teleparallel theories are not well understood yet .",
    "the only known torsional topological invariant is the nieh - yan term , see @xcite , and in particular @xcite in the context of teleparallel theories .",
    "the teleparallel equivalent of the gauss - bonnet term was first considered in @xcite who studied a theory based on the function @xmath8 . as is somewhat expected ,",
    "the gauss - bonnet term differs from its teleparallel equivalent by a divergence term .",
    "hence , as in modified general relativity , it is possible to formulate modified theories based on the gauss - bonnet terms or its teleparallel equivalent in such a way that both theories are physically distinct .",
    "the link between these theories comes from the divergence term which needs to be taken into account when establishing the relationship between the different possible theories .",
    "we also allow our action functional to depend on the trace of the energy - momentum tensor since this is a popular modification that has been investigated in recent years @xcite .",
    "there exits a large body of literature dealing with the various modified theories of gravity that have been investigated , see for instance the following reviews @xcite    _ our conventions : _ greek indices denote spacetime coordinates , latin indices are frame or tangent space indices .",
    "@xmath9 stands for the tetrad ( 1-form ) , while @xmath10 denotes the inverse tetrad ( vector field ) .",
    "the minkowski metric is @xmath11 with signature @xmath12 . where possible",
    "we follow the conventions of  @xcite .",
    "the teleparallel formulation of general relativity is well known and provides some interesting insight into this theory .",
    "the fundamental objects of this formulation are the tetrad fields @xmath13 and inverse tetrad fields @xmath14 which satisfy the orthogonality relations @xmath15    the standard ( metric ) formulation of general relativity is based on the metric tensor which is uniquely defined by given tetrad fields .",
    "the metric @xmath16 , the inverse metric @xmath17 , and the tetrads and inverse tetrads are related by @xmath18 the determinant of the tetrad @xmath19 is denoted by @xmath20 and corresponds to the volume element of the metric which means we have @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the determinant of the metric tensor .",
    "the starting point of the teleparallel formulation of general relativity is the object @xmath23 from which we can define the torsion tensor @xmath24 we note that this is the skew - symmetric part of @xmath25 . in terms of spacetime indices",
    "the torsion tensor is @xmath26 in geometries with torsion the connection can be decomposed into a levi - civita part and an additional part due to the presence of torsion .",
    "the complete connection which we call the weitzenbck connection decomposes as follows @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the levi - civita connection and @xmath29 is the contortion tensor .",
    "the contortion tensor can be expressed using the torsion tensor as follows @xmath30 we note that the contortion tensor @xmath31 is antisymmetric in its last two indices , this follows from the skew - symmetry of the torsion tensor in its last two indices , see ( [ eq : tor ] ) .",
    "contracting the torsion tensor over the first and second index gives the so - called torsion vector @xmath32    considering a globally flat manifold means that the riemann tensor vanishes identically @xmath33 , which is always possible by choosing the weitzenbck connection .",
    "next , we can decompose the riemann tensor into a levi - civita part and another part due to torsion .",
    "the levi - civita part of this tensor can then be expressed in terms of the contorsion tensor as follows @xmath34 where @xmath35 stands for the covariant derivative with respect to the leci - civita connection .",
    "if we contract the first and third index of the riemann tensor , we obtain the decomposition of the ricci tensor @xmath36 finally , by using ( [ kt ] ) and contracting once more , one arrives at the well - known formula @xmath37 here @xmath38 stands for the metric or levi - civita ricci scalar , see also  @xcite .",
    "the main implication of the previous rewriting is that it is hence possible to express the metric ricci scalar entirely in terms of torsion @xmath39 this result can also be written in the following way @xmath40 where the tensor @xmath41 is defined as follows @xmath42 its form in spacetime coordinates can be written as @xmath43 frequently the specific combination @xmath44 is referred to simply as the torsion scalar @xmath2 so that eq .",
    "( [ riccis ] ) can be written very nicely as @xmath45 recalling that the einstein - hilbert action of general relativity is based on the ricci scalar , we are now able to formulate a theory equivalent to this based on torsion by simply using the right - hand side of ( [ riccit ] ) as our lagrangian instead of the left - hand side . in either case one",
    "considers variations with respect to the tetrad fields .",
    "since we will study the boundary term in some detail we introduce the notation @xmath46 so that ( [ riccit ] ) can simply be written as @xmath0 .    an important consideration is the behaviour of the above quantities under local lorentz transformations .",
    "it is clear from ( [ eq : tor ] ) that the local lorentz transformation @xmath47 will change the torsion tensor as the lorentz transformations @xmath48 are local and hence functions of space and time so that derivatives of @xmath48 appear . therefore the torsion tensor does not transform covariantly under local lorentz transformations , see also @xcite",
    "note that this is a direct consequence of the teleparallel approach and the combination @xmath49 is the only combination of @xmath2 and @xmath3 which is locally lorentz invariant .",
    "in contrast to the standard teleparallel approach , complete lorentz invariance is preserved when considering metric - affine theories @xcite in which the metric and torsion and are treated independently , see also @xcite .",
    "consequently , the torsion scalar @xmath2 and the boundary term @xmath3 are both lorentz scalars in this approach .",
    "the metric - affine framework has inspired the recent covariant formulation of @xmath5 gravity @xcite which is based on the idea of allowing the spin connection to be a dynamical variable in addition to the tetrad fields .",
    "this is an interesting alternative treatment to teleparallel theories of gravity which could in also be applied to investigate gauss - bonnet extensions .",
    "teleparallel geometries have been well - understood for many decades .",
    "perhaps more surprising is the fact that the gauss - bonnet term was not studied in this context until quite recently  @xcite .",
    "the gauss - bonnet term is a quadratic combination of the riemann tensor and its contractions given by @xmath50 which plays an important role of connecting geometry to topology .",
    "it is well known that the addition of the gauss - bonnet to the einstein - hilbert action does not affect the field equations of general relativity , provided one works in a four dimensional setting .",
    "this fact implies that the topology of the solutions is unconstrained . in more than four dimensions",
    "the addition of the gauss - bonnet term affects the resulting gravitational field equations .    following the procedure outlined in the above",
    ", we can again compute the ( complete ) gauss - bonnet term using the connection ( [ eq : connection ] ) and decompose this result into a levi - civita part and an additional part depending on torsion only . understandably , this process is quite involved .",
    "it can be shown , see  @xcite , that the gauss - bonnet term can be expressed in a fashion similar form to ( [ riccit ] ) which simply reads @xmath51 the teleparallel gauss - bonnet term @xmath52 is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the generalised kronecker delta which in four dimensions is equivalent to @xmath55 .",
    "this term depends on the contortion tensor and its first partial derivatives , and it is quartic in contortion .",
    "this is expected as curvature in general is quadratic in contortion , and the gauss - bonnet term is itself quadratic in curvature .    on the other hand",

    "equivalently , by using ( [ relation ] ) , this term can be rewritten depending only on the contorsion tensor as follows @xmath58\\ , .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when discussing the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity we briefly touched upon the issue of lorentz invariance .",
    "as before , it is clear that for instance @xmath52 can not be a lorentz scalar . to see this , one notes that the final term in the definition  ( [ eq : deftg ] ) contains a partial derivative .",
    "therefore this term will contribute second partial derivatives of the local lorentz transformations which can not be cancelled by any other term in @xmath52 .",
    "since the gauss - bonnet term @xmath59 is a lorentz scalar , these second derivative terms must be cancelled by terms coming from @xmath56 .",
    "consequently the combination @xmath60 is the unique lorentz invariant combination which can be constructed .",
    "this fact becomes important when considering modified theories of gravity based on the teleparallel equivalent of the gauss - bonnet scalar .",
    "in the following we will show some simple examples of the gauss - bonnet term and its teleparallel equivalent .",
    "let us begin with the the flrw metric and the diagonal tetrad given by @xmath61 using spatial cartensian coordinates .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that @xmath62 these three quantities display some of the key properties important in this context .",
    "firstly , we note that @xmath52 and @xmath56 depend on the euclidean distance from the origin while the gauss - bonnet term @xmath59 is independent of the cartesian coordinates .",
    "the unique linear combination @xmath63 is independent of position .",
    "secondly , in case of a spatially flat universe these terms are absent and the term @xmath56 identically vanishes .",
    "the terms depending on the spatial coordinates can be changed be working with a different tetrad , or in other words , these terms are affected by local lorentz transformations .",
    "finding a tetrad for which @xmath52 and @xmath56 are both independent of the spatial coordinates is a rather involved tasks , however , following the approach outline in @xcite we will show that a tetrad with this property can be constructed . before doing so",
    ", we discuss another example with different symmetry properties .      in this example we consider static and spherically symmetric spacetimes and work with isotropic coordinates @xmath64 to avoid coordinate issues with the tetrads . including time dependence is straightforward , however , the resulting equations are too involved .",
    "we choose @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the euclidean distance from the origin .",
    "the metric takes the isotropic form @xmath67 the first three quantities of interest @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are given by @xmath68 a direct calculation verifies that indeed @xmath0 as we expected .",
    "next , we will state the explicit forms of @xmath59 , @xmath52 and @xmath56 which are @xmath69 which indeed satisfies the required identity @xmath70 we note that the expressions are considerably more complicated than in the previous case .",
    "the tetrads used in ( [ eq : badflrw ] ) and ( [ eq : badsss ] ) serve as simple examples which are useful to compute the relevant quantities .",
    "however , in the context of extended or modified teleparallel theories of gravity , such tetrads should be avoided .",
    "the construction of a suitable static and spherically symmetric tetrad in @xmath5 gravity , for instance , is rather involved , see  @xcite . in general the choice of a suitable parallelisation is a subtle and non - trivial issue , the interested reader is referred to @xcite .      let us next consider flrw metric in spherical coordinates given by @xmath71\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 is the scale factor of the universe and @xmath73 is the spatial curvature which corresponds to flat , close and open cosmologies , respectively .",
    "the simplest tetrad field which yields the above metric is the diagonal @xmath74 however , when this tetrad is used in @xmath5 gravity it implies an off - diagonal field equation which is highly restrictive , namely the condition @xmath75 .",
    "such a theory is equivalent to general relativity and hence not a modification . in order to avoid this issue",
    ", one can follow the procedure outlined @xcite which allows for the construction of tetrads which result in more favourable field equations .",
