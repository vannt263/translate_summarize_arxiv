    "recent technological advances in microfabrication bring growing interests in studying exciton condensation in different bilayer physical systems such as the semiconductor electron - hole bilayers @xcite and graphene bilayers @xcite .",
    "a number of novel physical phenomena are obtained in these systems , such as the bcs - bec crossover @xcite as well as the subtle phase transition in the crossover region induced by the density imbalance @xcite , the dark and bright excitonic condensation under spin - orbit coupling @xcite , anomalous exciton condensation in high landau levels in magnetic field @xcite , room - temperature superfluidity in graphene bilayers @xcite , etc .",
    "the conventional electron - hole bilayers are fabricated with semiconductor heterostructures such as gaas / algaas / gaas .",
    "the character of the semiconductor electron - hole bilayers is that the electron and hole bands are quadratic ones with different effective masses , which means missing particle - hole symmetry in these kinds of systems and small superfluid density .",
    "hence , in semiconductor electron - hole bilayers , the excitonic condensation needs very low temperature .",
    "another better candidate for electron - hole bilayers is graphene , which has a two - dimensional ( 2d ) massless linear dirac - band structure in low energy limit .",
    "however , the coupling between different dirac - cone structures in the same brilliouin zone brings flaw to graphene to fabricate electron - hole bilayers @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "another growing interest in condensed matter physics is the very recent theoretical prediction @xcite and experimental verification @xcite of the topological insulators @xcite ( tis ) with strong spin - orbit interaction .",
    "several three - dimensional ( 3d ) solids , such as bi@xmath3sb@xmath4 alloys , bi@xmath0se@xmath1-family crystals , have been identified @xcite to be strong tis possessing anomalous band structures .",
    "the energy scale for the surface states of these 3d tis is dominated by the @xmath5-linear spin - orbit interaction .",
    "especially , the strong tis surface has single dirac - cone band structure which is also different from graphene . as a result",
    ", it is expected that the excitonic condensate of these topological surface states probably have new characters .",

    "@xcite , a gated double ti layers separated by an insulating spacer . using this tib model",
    ", we numerically study the excitonic condensation of ti surface states .",
    "we find that the system also presents bcs - bec crossover along with the change in carrier densities in zero temperature limit .",
    "however , there are two characters different from those of conventional excitonic condensation in semiconductor bilayer systems .",
    "the first is that the bcs phase of tib is more robust than that of the semiconductor bilayer systems ; the second is that the superfluidity of the tib is more sensitive to the electron - hole density imbalance than that of the semiconductor bilayer systems .",
    "these two characters physically root in the @xmath5-linear band dispersion of the tib . moreover , by putting this tib model in bi@xmath0se@xmath1-family material , we investigate the excitonic condensation and only find the bec phase occurring due to the values of the parameters of the material .",
    "the critical temperature of excitonic condensation in bi@xmath7se@xmath1-family tib is also calculated in the self - consistent mean - field ( scmf ) approximation ( @xmath8 @xmath9 k ) , which is found to be higher than that in the traditional semiconductor electron - hole bilayers .",
    "more interestingly , we can expect this relative high - temperature excitonic condensation since our calculated scmf critical temperature is approximately equal to the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transition temperature .",
    "the tib system is schematically illustrated in the left panel in fig .",
    "two ti films are separated by an insulating spacer of thickness @xmath10 , and the electron ( hole ) density can be independently tuned by the external gate voltage @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the linear dispersions of the tis around dirac point are cartoonishly depicted in the right panel in fig .",
    "the grand - canonical hamiltonian describing this tib system can be written as @xmath13 here , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are 2d wave vectors in the layers , @xmath17 is the quantization volume .",

    "note that @xmath25=@xmath26 and @xmath27=@xmath28the surface states of the strong ti film have the linear dispersion : @xmath29=@xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 is the fourier transform of the coulomb interaction : the intralayer coulomb repulsive interaction @xmath32(@xmath33)=@xmath34 , and the interlayer coulomb attractive interaction @xcite @xmath35=@xmath36 , which indicates that on the one hand , in the limit of @xmath37 , the interaction between electron and hole becomes that in monolayer ; on the other hand , in the large thickness limit @xmath38 , the interactions between the electrons in upper layer and holes in lower layer should vanish . here , @xmath39 is the background dielectric constant .",
    "furthermore , for the present tib system , the two ti films are separated by an inulating spacer such as sio@xmath0 , and the spin - orbit interaction in the spacer is obviously negligible .",
