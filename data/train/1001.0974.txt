    "the dynamics of matter or classical waves in periodic potentials subjected to external dc or ac forces is strongly influenced by bragg scattering , which is responsible for such important effects as bloch oscillations ( bos ) and dynamic localization ( dl ) .",
    "dynamic localization was originally proposed by dunlap and kenkre @xcite as a suppression of the broadening of a charged - particle wave packet as it moves along a tight - binding lattice driven by a sinusoidal ac electric field .",
    "dl was then explained in terms of quasienergy band collapse @xcite , and the general conditions of dl beyond the nearest - neighboring tight - binding ( nntb ) approximation used by dunlap and kenkre were subsequently investigated in ref.@xcite .",
    "the interest on dl has been recently renewed since the first experimental observations of dl have been reported for matter waves trapped in dynamical optical lattices @xcite , and for light waves in curved waveguide arrays @xcite . matter or light waves may also interact with complex potentials .",
    "complex crystals for matter waves emerge , for instance , in the near resonant interaction of light with open two - level systems @xcite , whereas in optics complex crystals are realized by waveguide arrays that include gain and/or loss regions @xcite .",
    "as compared to ordinary crystals , complex crystals exhibit some unique properties , such as violation of the friedel s law of bragg scattering and nonreciprocal diffraction @xcite . a special class of complex crystals is provided by complex potentials possessing parity - time ( @xmath0 ) symmetry @xcite .",
    "an important property of @xmath0 crystals is to admit of an entirely real - valued energy spectrum below a phase transition ( symmetry - breaking ) point , in spite of the non - hermiticity of the underlying hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "a recent study on bos in @xmath0 crystals @xcite has shown that the common wisdom of coherent quantum transport in a crystal is greatly modified when dealing with a complex crystal .",
    "+ it is the aim of this work to investigate the coherent motion of wave packets in a complex @xmath0 crystal driven by an ac - like force . in particular",
    ", it is shown that in the unbroken @xmath0 symmetry region time reversal symmetry of the ac - like force preserves the reality of the quasienergy spectrum , and that a full band collapse , corresponding to dynamic localization , occurs within the single - band and nntb approximations like in ordinary crystals",
    ". however , the transport properties of the lattice are deeply modified at the @xmath0 symmetry breaking , where bragg scattering in the crystal becomes highly non - reciprocal . in the following analysis , we will consider specifically wave packets in a photonic lattice system @xcite , however the results can be applied to other lattice realizations , such as to matter wave tunneling in dynamic complex optical lattices .",
    "in optics , the coherent motion of charged quantum particles in periodic potentials driven by an ac electric field can be mimicked by the propagation of light waves in a periodically - curved photonic lattice @xcite . in the scalar and paraxial approximations ,",
    "light propagation at wavelength @xmath1 in the lattice is described by the schrdinger - type wave equation @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the reduced wavelength , @xmath4 is the substrate refractive index , @xmath5 is the potential , @xmath6 is the refractive index profile of the lattice ( spatial period @xmath7 ) , and @xmath8 is a fictitious refractive index gradient proportional to the local waveguide axis curvature which mimics the action of a driving force @xcite . in particular ,",
    "a sinusoidal ac - like force is simply mimicked by a sinusoidal bending profile of the waveguides @xcite . in a complex lattice , the refractive index is complex , and the @xmath0 symmetry requirement @xmath9 corresponds to suitable combinations of optical gain and loss regions in the lattice as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the potential are denoted by @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , where @xmath12 is a dimensionless parameter that measures the anti - hermitian strength of @xmath13 .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath13 turns out to be real - valued for @xmath14 , where @xmath15 corresponds to the transition from unbroken to broken @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "numerical studies generally show that for @xmath16 the spectrum is composed by bands separated by gaps like in an ordinary crystal , whereas for @xmath17 band merging is observed with the appearance of pairs of complex - conjugate eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "for instance , for the potential defined by @xmath18 one has @xmath19 @xcite",
    ". + in this section we consider the unbroken symmetry phase , i.e. the case @xmath20 .",
    "as recently shown in ref.@xcite , for @xmath20 the motion of a bloch particle in presence of an external dc force @xmath21 can be described following the same lines as in ordinary crystals by expanding the field @xmath22 as a superposition of bloch - floquet eigenfunctions @xmath23 of @xmath13 , where the wave number @xmath24 varies in the first brillouin zone , i.e. @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the bragg wave number , @xmath27 is the band index , and @xmath28 is the periodic part of the bloch - floquet eigenfunction . after setting @xmath29 and assuming normalized eigenfunctions such that @xmath30 with @xmath31 , the evolution equations for",
    "the spectral coefficients @xmath32 read @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the energy of @xmath35 [ with @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the off - diagonal elements @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) in eq.(3 ) are responsible for interband transitions , i.e. zener tunneling ( zt ) .",
    "if bands @xmath27 and @xmath40 are separated by a large gap and the ac force @xmath41 is small enough such that @xmath42 in the entire brillouin zone , zt is negligible as in ordinary lattices and one can make the single - band approximation by setting @xmath43 for @xmath44 in eq.(3 ) . in the single - band approximation one thus obtains @xmath45 c(\\kappa , z)\\ ] ] where we omitted , for the sake of simplicity , the band index @xmath27 and set @xmath46 . because of the symmetry of @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 have well defined and opposite parity under the inversion @xmath50 ; this implies that @xmath51 is a real - valued function of @xmath24 , vanishing for a real potential ( i.e. for @xmath52 ) .",
    "as previously shown in @xcite , when a dc force @xmath21 is applied to the crystal , from eq.(4 ) it follows that the energy spectrum is described by a complex - valued wannier - stark ladder .",
    "the non - reality of the energy spectrum comes from the extra - term @xmath51 in eq.(4 ) and is physically due to the fact that the external dc force @xmath21 breaks the @xmath0 symmetry of the full hamiltonian @xmath53 . for an ac - like force with period @xmath54 , because of the @xmath55-periodicity of the hamiltonian its energy spectrum is replaced by a quasi - energy spectrum .",
    "moreover , in the single - band approximation dl corresponds to a complete collapse of the quasi - energy band like in an ordinary crystal @xcite . according to floquet s theorem of periodic systems ,",
    "the quasi - energy @xmath56 for the @xmath27-th lattice band can be readily calculated by looking for a solution to eq.(4 ) of the form @xmath57 $ ] with @xmath58 .",
    "one obtains @xmath59\\ ] ] where we have set @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "let us assume that the ac forcing @xmath41 is an odd function with respect to some point @xmath62 , i.e. that @xmath63 for some @xmath62 in the oscillation cycle .",
    "this condition is satisfied , for instance , for the important case of an harmonic ( e.g. sinusoidal or cosinusoidal ) ac driving force , originally considered by dunlap and kenkre @xcite and that will be assumed in the following . owing to this additional temporal symmetry on the driving force , which is absent for the bo problem @xcite , a real - valued quasi - energy spectrum for the non - hermitian time - periodic hamiltonian @xmath64",
    "is obtained .",
    "in fact , in this case the imaginary term on the right hand side of eq.(5 ) vanishes after integration because @xmath41 and @xmath65 have opposite parity for the inversion @xmath66 .",
    "the quasi - energy spectrum is thus real - valued and its expression takes the usual form as in a conventional crystal .",
    "dl corresponds to a collapse of the quasienergy band @xmath56 , i.e. to @xmath67 . for most driving fields like a sinusoidal field",
    ", dl can be attained exactly solely in the nntb approximation , i.e. when the band shape @xmath68 is sinusoidal @xcite , @xmath69 . in this case , assuming for the sake of definiteness a sinusoidal ac - like force @xmath70 , the explicit form of the quasi - energy reads @xcite @xmath71 band collapse , leading to dl , is thus attained when @xmath72 @xcite .",

    "figure 1 shows a typical example of band diagram below the phase transition point @xmath86 ) , numerically computed by a spectral analysis of the hamiltonian @xmath13 .",
    "note that the lowest band of the array is with excellent accuracy approximated by a sinusoidal curve and turns out to be separated by a large gap from the second band .",
    "dl is thus expected to occur provided that the lattice is excited in its lowest order band .",
    "figures 2(a ) and ( b ) show a typical spreading ( discrete diffraction ) of a gaussian wave packet @xmath87 in the absence of the external force , for either a broad gaussian beam that excites at normal incidence a few lattice sites at @xmath88 [ @xmath89 , fig.2(a ) ] , and a narrow gaussian beam that excites at normal incidence a single well of the lattice [ @xmath90 , fig.2(b ) ] . in both cases ,",
    "the lowest band of the array is mainly excited , as discussed e.g. in @xcite .",
    "after application of the sinusoidal force [ figs.2(c - f ) ] , suppression of beam diffraction and self - imaging effects are clearly observed when period and amplitude of forcing satisfy the condition @xmath91 ( first zero of bessel @xmath92 function ) , as shown in figs.2(e ) and ( f ) .",
    "as @xmath93 is increased to reach and cross the @xmath0 symmetry - breaking point @xmath94 , gap narrowing till band merging , associated to the appearance of pairs of complex - conjugate eigenvalues , is observed @xcite .",
    "for instance , for the potential defined by eq.(2 ) , at the transition point the band diagram is given by the free - particle energy dispersion curve @xmath95 , periodically folded inside the first brillouin zone @xcite ( see the dotted curve in fig.1 ) . in this case , as previously noticed for bos @xcite , wave packet transport is deeply modified and can not be described by means of the canonical model ( 3 ) introduced in the previous section . from a physical viewpoint , this is related to the highly non - reciprocal behavior of bragg scattering in the crystal and violation of friedel s law of bragg diffraction for crystal inversion @xcite . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we limit here to consider the dynamical behavior of a broad wave packet in the complex lattice defined by eq.(2 ) at @xmath78 , i.e. @xmath96 , which enables a rather simple analytical and physical analysis . as opposed to ref .",
    "@xcite , we assume here an ac - like force , namely @xmath70 .",
    "figure 3 shows a few typical examples of wave packet dynamics as obtained by a numerical analysis of eq.(1 ) when the lattice is excited at @xmath88 with a broad gaussian beam @xmath87 for a fixed value of the ac modulation period @xmath54 and for increasing values of the amplitude @xmath97 . for a small amplitude @xmath97 ,",
    "it turns out that the wave packet propagates as if the lattice were absent [ fig.3(a ) ] , following an oscillatory path as predicted by the semiclassical analysis of eq.(1 ) with @xmath98 .",
    "owing to the external force , the mean wave packet momentum varies periodically according to @xmath99 .",
    "as the forcing @xmath97 reaches and crosses the critical value @xmath100 , new wave packets , arising from first - order bragg diffraction , periodically bifurcate from the primary beam at propagation distances @xmath55 satisfying the bragg condition @xmath101 [ see figs.3(b ) and 3(c ) ] .",
    "the mean momentum of the first - order diffracted wave packets differs from that of the primary wave packet by an additional term @xmath102 , which explains the refraction of the first - order diffracted beams at the angle @xmath103 observed in figs.3(b ) and 3(c ) . at stronger forcing , namely for @xmath104 , additional wave packets bifurcate from the first - order wave packets at propagation distances @xmath55 such that @xmath105 , as shown in fig.3(d ) .",
