    "the recent measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy and polarization from experiments as wmap @xcite , acbar @xcite and boomerang @xcite have confirmed the theoretical predictions of the standard cosmological model based on inflation , dark matter and a cosmological constant .",
    "this not only permits to place stringent constraints on several parameters of the model but also to use it as new laboratory where to test physical processes in a environment not achievable otherwise .    in particular",
    ", there is a remarkable agreement between the theoretical description of the recombination process , occurring at @xmath1 , and cmb data , a circumstance that severely constrains new sources of ionizing photons , and more in general any deviation from standard recombination @xcite , as recently shown by several groups of authors ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . most of the recent literature has analyzed the modified recombination by means of a phenomenological approach , parameterizing in a model independent way the modifications to the recombination process . here , we focus instead on the constraints that can be placed on the properties of dm particles , under the assumption that recombination is modified _ only _ by dark matter annihilation . with respect previous studies @xcite",
    ", our analysis includes more recent data ( wmap 5-year data ) , and it concentrates on a new class of dm models that have been recently proposed to explain the observed anomalies in cosmic ray data .",
    "in fact , the attempt to explain the high energy positron and electron rise seen by pamela @xcite and atic @xcite in terms of dark matter ( dm ) annihilation has prompted the proliferation of new dm candidates with very large annihilation cross - section . in particular , in models with a `` sommerfeld '' enhancement of the annihilation cross - section @xmath2 , the efficent exchange of force carriers at low relative particle velocities leads to a velocity - dependent @xmath2 , which behaves roughly as @xmath3 for high @xmath4 , and saturates below a critical @xmath5 ( typically smaller than the local velocity dispersion , @xmath6 , see below ) , that depends on the ratio between the masses of the force carrier and the dm particle .",
    "a nice feature of these models is that they can be made naturally consistent with standard thermal freeze - out .",
    "in fact , dm freezes out typically with @xmath7(1 ) , and @xmath2 will grow from this minimum value as the universe cools and expand . then , when the first gravitationally bound structures form , dm virializes within the gravitational potential of the host halo , thus leading for milky way ( mw)-like galaxies at z=0 to virialized velocities of order @xmath8 .",
    "smaller velocities , thus a larger @xmath2 can be achieved in dm haloes with low velocities such as mw subhaloes@xcite or small haloes at high redshift@xcite .",
    "although it is unclear whether the annihilation flux can be boosted enough to explain the pamela and atic data without being in conflict with other measurements , such as the anti - proton or gamma - ray fluxes towards the galactic center ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .    when recombination occurs , around @xmath91000 , the relic wimps have not yet formed sizable gravitationally bound structures and are cold enough for the sommerfeld mechanism to produce substantial enhancement of the annihilation cross - section with respect to the thermal value ( after kinetic decoupling dm particle temperature evolves adiabatically as t@xmath10 , so @xmath11 , for a @xmath12(100gev / c@xmath13 ) mass wimp ) . as we will see below",
    ", the actual enhancement is model - dependent , because different dm models lead to a different behaviour of @xmath14 , but in general we expect that for large enough cross - sections , dm annihilation will significantly modify the recombination history , thus leaving a clear imprint on the angular power spectra of cmb anisotropy and polarization .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in the next section we describe the effects of annihilating dark matter on primordial recombination and the characteristic imprints on the cmb angular spectra . in section iii",

    "the latter boosts the population at @xmath40 , increasing the rate of photoionization by the cmb from these excited states .",
