    "the observed temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) strongly suggested that our universe might experience an accelerated expansion , more precisely , inflation  @xcite , at a seminal stage of evolution .",

    "therefore , the bicep2 result is in disagreement with the _ planck _ result . to reduce the inconsistency between planck and bicep2 experiments , we need to include the running of the spectral index @xmath10 . with the running of the spectral index , the 68% constraints from the _",
    "planck_+wp+highl data are @xmath11 and @xmath12 with @xmath13 at the 95% confidence level .",
    "thus , the running of the spectral index needs to be smaller than 0.008 at the 3@xmath14 level for any viable inflation model .",
    "because different inflationary models predict different magnitudes for the tensor perturbations , such large tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath2 from the bicep2 measurement will give a strong constraint on the inflation models . also , the inflaton potential is around the grand unified theory ( gut ) scale @xmath15  gev , and",
    "hubble scale is about @xmath16  gev . from the naive analysis of lyth bound  @xcite ,",
    "a large field inflation will be experienced , and then the validity of effective field theory will be challenged since the high - dimensional operators are suppressed by the reduced planck scale .",

    "also , gravity is critical in the early universe , so it seems to us that supergravity theory is a natural framework for inflation model building  @xcite .",
    "however , supersymmetry breaking scalar masses in a generic supergravity theory are of the same order as the gravitino mass , inducing the reputed @xmath19 problem  @xcite , where all the scalar masses are of the order of the hubble parameter because of the large vacuum energy density during inflation  @xcite .",
    "there are two elegant solutions : no - scale supergravity  @xcite , and shift - symmetry in the khler potential  @xcite .",
