    "nuclei comprise 99.9% of all baryonic matter in the universe and are the fuel that burns in stars @xcite .",
    "the rather complex nature of the nuclear forces among protons and neutrons generates a broad range and diversity in the nuclear phenomena that we observe .",
    "experiments indicate that developing a comprehensive description of all nuclei and their reactions requires theoretical and experimental investigations of rare isotopes with unusual neutron - to - proton ratios that are very different from their stable counterparts .",
    "these rare nuclei are difficult to produce and study experimentally since they can have extremely short lifetimes .",
    "the goal of a comprehensive description and reliable modeling of nuclei represents one of the great intellectual opportunities for nuclear physics in the coming years .",
    "key scientific themes being addressed by the physics of nuclei and nuclear astrophysics communities are captured by five overarching questions :    * what is the nature of the nuclear force that binds protons and neutrons into stable nuclei and rare isotopes ? * what is the origin of simple patterns in complex nuclei ?",
    "* what is the nature of neutron stars and dense nuclear matter ?",
    "* what is the origin of the elements in the cosmos ?",
    "* what are the nuclear reactions that drive stars and stellar explosions ?",
    "these questions align well with the drivers of rare isotope science as recently summarized in a report of the u. s. national academies of science rare isotope scientific assessment committee ( risac ) @xcite .",
    "one primary aspect of the first and second question concerns testing the predictive power of models by extending experiments to new regions of mass and proton - to - neutron ratio and identifying new phenomena that will challenge existing many - body theory .",
    "one of those challenges concerns the concept of nuclear shell structure and magic numbers .",
    "understanding the origin of the classic , stable , nuclear magic numbers earned goeppert - mayer and jensen the 1963 nobel prize . at the time , there were no data on very neutron - rich nuclei ; however , theoretical predictions and experimental discoveries in the last decade indicate that nuclear shell structure is a rather fluid concept .",
    "for example , experimental data indicate that the magic numbers at n=20 and 28 fade away with neutron number , and the new magic numbers at n=14 , 16 , and 32 seem to appear ( see , for example ref .",
    "nuclei far from stability also exhibit unusual properties as compared to their stable cousins .",
    "for example , the radial extension of the two - neutron halo in @xmath0li ( where @xmath1li acts as a core ) is the same as that of @xmath2pb .",
    "we can conclude from just these two examples that nuclear structure is changing in the exotic environment .",
    "since nuclei are self - bound , they generate their own mean field which determines how shell orbitals are filled .",
    "the experimental evidence indicates the way orbits are being filled is changing in neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "furthermore , many - body correlations such as pairing superfluidity become crucial when the binding energy becomes small .",
    "these correlations also affect the open - shell character of nuclei , since the continuum of scattering states lies very close to the bound state .",
    "one of the interesting features of nuclear physics today is the overlaps and synergy between the physics of nuclei and nuclear astrophysics .",
    "the changes in nuclear structure occurring away from the valley of beta - stability do affect nucleosynthesis pathways .",
    "we have initial evidence of this on the measurements of the lifetime of @xmath3ni @xcite and its impact on r - process nucleosynthesis .",
    "other examples involve the impact of electron capture on the core collapse mechanism of type - ii supernovae @xcite and the challenge of obtaining a nuclear equation of state that can quantitatively be used in predictions of neutron star properties @xcite .",
    "a robust theoretical capability is required if we want to understand stable and exotic nuclei that are the core of matter and the fuel of stars .",
    "i will devote the remainder of this proceedings to a discussion of some of the issues that remain in building this capability .",
    "the nuclear many - body problem spans nuclei from a=2 ( the deuteron ) to the superheavy region , and different theoretical techniques are pursued in different regions of the chart of nuclei .",
    "this is depicted in fig . 1 where the current reach of various theoretical methods is interposed in the chart of nuclei .",
    "the challenges for theory can be viewed broadly as : determining the nuclear interaction , calculating ab initio nuclei , including the continuum , and finding an appropriate energy density functional for a nuclear density functional theory approach .",
    "i will briefly discuss these areas in the following subsections , drawing from some of the work in which i have been involved .    .",
    "for heavy nuclei , the density functional theory based on self - consistent / mean - field theory ( blue ) is the tool of choice . by investigating the intersections between these theoretical strategies ,",
    "one aims to develop a unified description of the nucleus.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    [ fig1 ]      the forces among nucleons determine how nuclei behave .",
    "these forces arise from qcd .",
    "while there is some effort to extract directly from lattice calculations @xcite the nuclear scattering , there have also been important developments in the application of a chiral effective field theory ( eft ) to the nuclear problem @xcite .",
    "an eft was developed for nuclei from a chiral lagrangian that maintains all the symmetries of qcd and treats as fundamental particles the pions and nucleons .",
    "a power - counting scheme was developed so that the expansion could be carried out in a systematic way using as a small parameter of expansion the momentum transfer in nucleon - nucleon scattering divided by the qcd energy scale ( 1 gev ) .",
    "this expansion has been carried out to fourth - order ( known as n@xmath4lo ) @xcite .",
    "the resulting nucleon - nucleon potential fits all scattering phase shifts up to the cut - off used in the eft .",
    "an interesting feature of the eft is that three - nucleon interactions arise naturally at the third order ( n@xmath5lo ) .",
    "chiral three - body forces have been known for a long time , but their systematic computation was not known until recently .",
    "nuclear spectroscopy using three - body interactions from the eft expansion improve when compared to calculations with two - body forces alone @xcite .",
    "this is also to be expected since it has long been known that two - body forces alone do not reproduce the correct binding in @xmath6he .",
    "thus , our starting point is a hamiltonian of the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the kinetic energy operator and @xmath9 is the center - of - mass operator ( so that the kinetic energy maintains translational invariance ) and the @xmath10 and @xmath11 represent the two - body and three - body nuclear potentials . the three - body interaction can actually be written in normal - ordered form as @xmath12 where @xmath13 represents a matrix element of the three - body interaction , @xmath14 denote the hole states , @xmath15 denote the particle states , @xmath16 denote all states , and @xmath17 denotes the residual three - body hamiltonian @xmath18 this notation will be useful in what follows .",
    "@xmath10 is often modeled with a very repulsive short distance interaction . in the case of av18 @xcite ,",
    "the central repulsion at @xmath19 is approximately 3 gev ; in n@xmath4lo , it is 500 mev @xcite . in order to use these interactions efficiently in a framework where one expands the many - body wave function in a basis , it is desirable to renormalize these interactions .",
    "this can be done in several ways , including the @xmath20-matrix approach @xcite and similarity transform methods @xcite .",
    "more recently , work in the direction of renormalization group ( rg ) @xcite techniques has been used to evolve the nucleon - nucleon interactions from high momentum to low momentum while preserving the nucleon - nucleon phase shifts up a given momentum .",
    "these interactions can then be projected onto the appropriate basis states for computation .",
    "these approaches offer promise with a price : the resulting two - body interactions do not recover the binding energy that would be obtained from a pure two - body calculation , and one must indeed include a three - body force in the calculations .",
    "furthermore , the rg interactions tend toward overbinding both in nuclei @xcite and in nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "the cure to this problem is the introduction of three - body forces which naturally occur in the rg approaches .",
    "another possibility is to adjust the three - body force that comes from eft to obtain the experimental binding of @xmath6he @xcite .      for light nuclei with mass numbers",
    "@xmath21 , both green s function monte carlo methods @xcite and no - core shell - model calculations @xcite using a basis - state expansion provide almost converged benchmarks for selected two- and three - body hamiltonians .",
    "the agreement with experimental data for many light nuclei is quite reasonable in these calculations .",
    "gfmc techniques do not need to utilize renormalized interactions , but they can only use local potentials , and the main group involved uses one two - body potential ( av18 , @xcite ) and an appropriate three - body potential fitted to experimental data in light nuclei @xcite . the ncsm approach can use any potential , but in most cases uses renormalized ones in order to obtain converging calculations .",
    "both methods exhibit exponential scaling with the number of particles ( to reach the same accuracy as in @xmath6he with the same methods ) .",
    "recently , we have seen a movement of these methods into the realm of light nuclear reactions .",
    "for example , the gfmc approach was used to describe @xmath22 scattering @xcite while the ncsm was used to calculate the @xmath23be(@xmath24)@xmath25b s - factor @xcite .",
    "recent progress has also been made in ab initio inelastic four - body scattering problems @xcite .",
    "coupled - cluster theory @xcite represents another approach to ab initio calculations of nuclei . along with collaborators , including computational chemists , we have developed the theory and methods  @xcite to the point where we can calculate nuclear properties in medium - mass nuclei .",
    "nuclear coupled - cluster theory exhibits polynomial scaling with the size of the basis state and number of particles , and is size - extensive .",
    "this very important property means that no unlinked diagrams enter into the theory .",
    "coupled - cluster theory starts with the simple assertion that the correlated ground - state wave function can be described by applying an exponentiated correlation operator to an uncorrelated slater determinant that naively describes the nucleus : @xmath26 the correlation operator @xmath27 induces various @xmath28p-@xmath28h ( particle - hole ) correlations ( up to the number of nucleons , @xmath29 , in the nucleus ) : @xmath30 the energy of the ground state is given by @xmath31 where the subscript @xmath32 means that only connected diagrams enter into the expressions .",
    "the @xmath33 operators take the form ( as is the case here for the two - body excitation operator ) @xmath34 where @xmath35 are the @xmath36-@xmath37 correlation amplitudes .",
    "one must compute the correlation amplitudes through equations that left - project @xmath38 onto the space of excited slater determinants .",
    "for example , if the theory only contains @xmath39 and @xmath40 operators , then the equations to solve for the coefficients @xmath41 and @xmath35 are @xmath42 and so on .",
    "( [ energy ] ) is exact ; however , the power of the coupled - cluster theory is its highly accurate computation of the energy even when one limits to lower order the number of @xmath33 operators in the theory .",
    "for example , at the @xmath39 and @xmath40 levels ( coupled clusters in singles and doubles , or ccsd ) , approximately 90% of the correlation is obtained , while with approximate triples corrections ( denoted ccsd(t ) ) , nearly all of the correlation energy is obtained @xcite .",
    "this contrasts sharply to truncated shell - model calculations where the truncation introduces unlinked diagrams causing growing errors with particle number @xcite .",
    "a certain amount of benchmarking of methods is necessary in order to understand their regions of validity . for coupled - cluster theory ,",
    "this has recently been performed in the triton and @xmath6he .",
    "we also performed extremely large basis - set calculations to which other methods can compare when they reach the technical capability to do so @xcite .",
    "we summarize our coupled - cluster results for the binding energies of @xmath6he , @xmath43o , and @xmath44ca in table  [ tab : corr_energy ] , which gives the extrapolated correlation energies @xmath45 and @xmath46 , relative to the uncorrelated energy @xmath47 .",
    "we find that for @xmath6he , @xmath43o , and @xmath44ca , the triples corrections are a factor of @xmath48 , and @xmath49 smaller than the ccsd correlation energies . from this",
    ", we estimate the missing correlation energy from quadruples , pentuplets , and so on to be of the order of @xmath50  mev for @xmath44ca .",
    "we note that @xmath43o is overbound by about @xmath51  mev , and @xmath44ca by about @xmath52  mev when compared to the experimental binding energies .",
    "this is not surprising and points to the importance of 3nf for nuclear structure calculations and to its apparently large role in the rg prescriptions .",
