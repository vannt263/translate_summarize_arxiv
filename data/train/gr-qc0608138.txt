    "the space - based gravitational wave ( gw ) mission lisa @xcite  laser interferometric space antenna  consists of three identical space - crafts forming an equilateral triangle of side @xmath1 km following heliocentric orbit trailing the earth by @xmath2 .",
    "the plane of lisa makes an angle of @xmath3 with the plane of the ecliptic .",
    "each space - craft completes one orbit around the sun as well as in lisa plane in one year .",
    "the mission is aimed at detecting and analyzing the low frequency gw signals in the frequency range of @xmath4 .",
    "the astrophysical sources for the lisa include galactic binaries , super - massive black - holes ( bh ) , extreme mass ratio inspirals , intermediate mass bhs .",
    "due to lisa s rotational as well as orbital motion , a fixed source in the barycentric frame appears to follow a specific track in its sky .",
    "this introduces amplitude modulation , frequency modulation , and phase modulation in the 6 doppler data streams .",
    "a large number of interferometric configurations , having different frequency and angular response , can be constructed from these data streams which makes lisa not just a single detector but a network of interferometers .",
    "the choice of the combination of the data streams depend on the which question one wishes to address . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we addressed the question of directional optimality in lisa i.e. for a given sky location , which lisa data stream gives maximum snr .",
    "it was shown that the directional optimality condition gives three data streams : ( 1 ) @xmath5  with maximum directional snr , ( 2 ) @xmath6  with minimum directional snr , ( 3 ) @xmath7  with zero directional snr .",
    "it was shown that the data stream @xmath5 optimally tracks the source motion ( in the lisa sky ) of a fixed source in the barycentric frame . here , _",
    "tracking _ involves appropriate choice of data combinations ( switch combinations as source moves ) which gives maximum snr in that direction .",
    "tracking known monochromatic binaries with such streams could give information about the source distance , polarizations .",
    "for an unknown distant source , it would amount to looking in a specific direction in a particular frequency band .",
    "in this work , we study the beaming property of the optimal data streams ( in particular , @xmath5 ) for a monochromatic source tracked for a year .",
    "we show that @xmath8 are beamed , i.e. they are sensitive towards the tracking direction .",
    "the beam - width depends on the frequency under consideration .",
    "we study the nature of this dependence .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec [ sec : ii ] , we review the tdi . in the first half of sec . [ sec : iii ] , we summarize the main results of ref.@xcite pertaining to the directionally optimal tdi streams . in the later half of sec [ sec : iii ] , we discuss the beaming properties of the directional streams followed by conclusion in sec .

    "the 6 lisa doppler data streams @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , [ see fig.[fig : lisa ]    of @xcite ] ] are obtained by letting the laser beams from each space - craft to travel towards two other space - crafts and are beaten with the on board laser .",
    "@xmath11 corresponds to the arm index and ( @xmath12)@xmath13 indicates the laser beam traveling in the ( anti-)clockwise direction .",
    "these doppler data streams contain the phase fluctuation noise of the master laser ( @xmath14 ) which is several orders of magnitude higher than the lisa designed sensitivity level of @xmath15 .",
    "using tdi technique , @xmath9 can be combined by appropriately delaying them with time delay operators to construct laser noise - free data streams ref .",
    "the tdi scheme is based on the principle of sagnac interferometry  the light - beam is split and made to travel along two paths in opposite direction of equal length which are then subtracted to remove the laser noise . in tdi ,",
    "equal path difference is achieved by adding doppler - streams with appropriate time delay operators which are then added ( or subtracted ) to obtain laser noise free data stream .",
    "any laser noise - free data combination can be written as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 are polynomials of time - delay operators @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the laser phase noise fluctuation at the space - craft @xmath11 . the sagnac tdi combinations @xmath20 in terms of @xmath21 are given by @xmath22 the @xmath23 combination is termed as symmetrized sagnac due to its symmetric structure and is insensitive to gw at low frequency @xmath24 mhz ( @xmath25 sec . ) .",
    "the noise vector for any combination @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 where the polynomials @xmath28 are defined as @xmath29 .",
    "the rest @xmath30 can be obtained by cyclic permutations .",
    "the @xmath31 and the @xmath32 are the one - sided power spectral densities ( psd ) of the proof - mass noise and optical - path noise respectively @xcite . in the frequency domain @xmath33 .    for simplicity , throughout this work , we assume the three arms of lisa to be equal i.e. @xmath34 .",
    "this helps in simplifying the expressions of tdi streams and are exact for low frequencies .",
    "however for higher frequencies , the above simplification leads to small discrepancies .",
    "nevertheless , one can easily extend this for unequal - arm interferometry .",
    "a set of tdi data streams which diagonalizes the noise covariance matrix @xmath35 are @xcite : @xmath36 @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are known as e , a and t in the lisa literature .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the three @xmath40 s give different frequency as well as angular response .",
    "a large number of tdi data streams @xmath41 with different angular and frequency responses can be constructed from them .",
    "the choice of a combination depends on the question one wishes to address . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we asked the following question : if one wants to observe a particular sky location @xmath42 , in a given frequency bin , which @xmath43 tdi data stream would be optimal ( maximum snr ) ?",
    "we first briefly summarize the results of ref .",
    "the gw response of @xmath40 expressed in frequency domain is @xmath44 where , the antenna pattern functions @xmath45 in terms of the transfer function of each doppler data stream is @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the direction vector to the source in the lisa frame , @xmath48 , @xmath49 appears in the accumulated phase due to gw oscillation as the laser travels from one space - craft to another ( anti-)clockwise direction , @xmath50 is the normal vector from lisa centre to each arm @xmath11 and @xmath51 are the responses of each arm to the two gw polarizations .",
    "the snr maximization for a particular direction is a constrained optimization problem .",
    "the data combinations are obtained from the eigen - vectors of the snr squared matrix ( averaged over the polarizations ) @xmath52    where @xmath53 , @xmath54 is the average signal energy over the gw polarization and @xmath55 is the noise psd of @xmath40 .",
    "the eigen - values are the instantaneous squared snr for the optimal data streams .",
    "the 3 eigen vectors are given by : @xmath56 where the coefficient @xmath57 and @xmath58   % \\,,\\no \\\\ % % % = { \\rm snr}_+^2 - | \\fx|^2 = -({\\rm snr}_\\times^2 - | \\f+|^2 ) \\ , .",
    "% c_\\times & = & \\fx^ { * } \\cdot \\f+\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the orthogonal pair of @xmath59 is obtained by the linear combination of @xmath60 and @xmath61 and hence lie in @xmath62  polarization  plane . the @xmath63 matrix which transforms @xmath62 to @xmath59",
    "is traceless - hermitian .",
    "naturally , the direction orthogonal to this plane contains no signal , i.e. a data stream obtained from @xmath64 ( orthogonal to @xmath65 plane ) is a null stream .",
    "hence , the triplet @xmath66 gives complete directional information of the gw signal .",
    "the tracking coefficients for the optimal data streams are @xmath67 . in summary , the data stream ( i ) @xmath68 gives maximum directional snr i. e. @xmath69 , ( ii ) @xmath70 gives the smallest non positive snr i. e. @xmath71 and ( iii ) @xmath72    gives zero directional snr . at low frequency , @xmath73 and @xmath5 tracks the @xmath13 polarization while @xmath6 tracks the @xmath74 polarization of gw , hence their subscripts @xcite .

    "[ fig : ant_pat50 ]    one would expect that beam - width of the optimal streams is a monotonically decreasing function of frequency .",
    "however , we find super - imposed oscillations on the monotonically decreasing behavior in the beam - width[see , figs . [",
    "fig : ant_pat50](b),[fig : sky_res ] ] ( maximum snr ) to track the source at different frequencies .",
    "this is because , it is shown in fig.[fig : snrrat](b ) , , for @xmath75 mhz , @xmath5 contributes more than @xmath76 to net@xmath77 . ] .",
    "below , we summarise the features of fig . [",
    "fig : sky_res ] : at low frequencies ( @xmath78 mhz ) , the overall beam - width of @xmath5 decreases monotonically and is dominated by @xmath79 . at frequencies above @xmath80 mhz , one observes modulation pattern in the beam - width ( with frequency @xmath81 ) .",
    "more importantly , at @xmath82 , @xmath39 contributes a large fraction to snr@xmath83 as compared to the other two @xmath84 s , see fig.[fig : snrrat](a ) .",
    "hence , the beam - width of @xmath5 is expected to carry the features of @xmath39 . as we know , @xmath39 is completely symmetric between the 3 arms .",
    "its angular response is insensitive in the neighborhood of lisa s zenith as well as its equatorial plane whereas it is sensitive in the polar window of @xmath85 .",
    "a source at @xmath86 follows a circular track in lisa sky with @xmath87 , see fig.[fig : sens](a ) .",
    "hence , the source s track coincides with the sensitive part of @xmath39 beam - pattern which explains its maximum integrated sensitivity along @xmath86 . as frequency increases , especially near @xmath88 , due to the symmetry of @xmath39",
    ", for all @xmath89 , the integrated antenna pattern of @xmath39 becomes invariant to azimuth @xmath90 , see fig.[fig : ant_pat10](b),[fig : ant_pat50](a ) which results in increase in the beam - width .",
    "this explains the sudden increase of solid angle at @xmath91 in fig.[fig : sky_res ] .    from fig.[fig :",
    "sky_res ] , one can estimate the number of non - overlapping patches ( templates ) required to cover the entire sky . for instance , at @xmath92 mhz ,",
    "one requires @xmath93 such patches whereas at @xmath94 mhz , this number goes to @xmath95 .",
    "in this work , we have studied the beaming properties of directionally optimal data streams @xmath5,@xmath6 and @xmath7 which contain the complete information of the gw signal in a particular direction .",
    "we have shown that they are beamed ( after tracking the source for a year ) and could be useful in eliminating certain sky directions or for consistency checks in lisa data analysis .",
