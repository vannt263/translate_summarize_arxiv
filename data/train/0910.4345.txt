    "one of the promising applications  @xcite of semiconductor quantum dots ( qds )  @xcite for quantum cryptography is the generation of entangled photon pairs ( epps ) on demand  @xcite .",

    "an excitonic fine structure for a model system with 2d - like anisotropic ho confining potential is considered .",
    "it is found that in the case of isotropic potential , the  bright \" exciton splitting vanishes . within the formalism of our effective excitonic hamiltonian , the effects of the lateral electric field on the excitonic fine structure were considered .",
    "it is found that the excitonic structure can be tuned with lateral electric field and that the magnitude of the exchange splitting is reduced but never to zero .",
    "the origin of this reduction is the separation of electron - hole pairs .",
    "finally , size - dependence of the  bright \" exciton splittings for the ground and excited state excitons was investigated and it was found that the size scaling of  bright \" exciton splitting can be different from the laws established using normalization conditions .",
