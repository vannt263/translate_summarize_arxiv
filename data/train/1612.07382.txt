    "the phenomenon of turbulence has been confirmed in almost all astrophysical systems , such as solar wind , accretion disks , galaxy clusters , interstellar medium and intracluster medium @xcite . since astrophysical scales",
    "are typically much larger than dissipative scales , these systems are all characterized by high values of reynolds numbers , @xmath0 ( of a characteristic length scale @xmath1 , characteristic velocity @xmath2 and a kinematic viscosity @xmath3 ) , which is a necessary condition for the establishment of turbulence . therefore , in general , if the matter of the universe is in a state of movement , turbulence will tend to develop .",
    "since most of the visible matter in the universe is in the state of plasma , characterized by a high conductivity and permeated by magnetic fields , this turbulence will be described by the set of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) equations , consisting of maxwell , navier - stokes and continuity equation .",
    "it is generally accepted that magnetic fields are present on all scales of the observable universe @xcite and it seems thus natural to assume that they were also present in the early universe .",
    "indeed , a large class of models trying to explain the observed magnetic fields assumes that they have a cosmological origin @xcite .",
    "it also seems plausible to characterize the early universe by a non - vanishing velocity field , coming from potential first - order phase transitions @xcite or density perturbations @xcite .",
    "it then follows that mhd turbulence could be an important phenomenon not only in astrophysical , but also in the cosmological context . in accord with this reasoning ,",
    "numerous studies have shown the role that mhd turbulence can have on the evolution of cosmological magnetic fields and the growth of their correlation length @xcite . + for temperatures higher than the temperature of the electroweak transition , the electroweak symmetry is restored and the description of turbulence should come from considering hypermagnetic ( @xmath4 ) and hyperelectric ( @xmath5 ) fields .",
    "hyperfields introduce the chiral coupling to fermions , coming from the chern - simons anomaly in the field lagrangian .",
    "this chiral coupling is related to the change in the fermion number before the electroweak symmetry breaking , given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 , with @xmath8 being the weinberg angle . in the case of charged carriers",
    "this gives raise to the effective current which should be added to the standard maxwell equations . above the electroweak transition ,",
    "turbulence therefore needs to be properly studied in the context of modified mhd equations , where this effective contribution and its evolution equation are also considered . unlike the standard mhd equations , this description leads to the coupling between velocity , hyperfields and the particle content of the theory .",
    "this framework can thus be important not only for a better understanding of the evolution of magnetic fields in the early universe , but also from the perspective of various baryogenesis models .",
    "baryogenesis and leptogenesis in the context of modified mhd equations around the electroweak transition were extensively studied , but all of these contributions ignored the potential role of turbulence @xcite . + for temperatures below the electroweak symmetry breaking , where hyperfields are replaced by the ordinary electric and magnetic fields , the chiral coupling will not lead to a change in the fermion number , but  if the lepton mass can be ignored  the anomaly leads to a change in the difference between left and right lepton number densities .",
    "it was therefore argued that the usual system of mhd equations should be extended to take into account the effect of the chiral anomaly for high enough temperatures@xcite .",
    "the presence of a chiral asymmetry will lead to an effective electrical current that will also appear in the mhd equations : @xmath9 where @xmath10 stands for the magnetic field and @xmath11 is the difference between chemical potentials associated with the left- and right- chiral electrons , respectively .",
    "chiral transport phenomena associated with chiral anomaly were recently studied theoretically and experimentally in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "this effect was also explored in the early universe , for temperatures higher than @xmath12 mev @xcite and around the electroweak transition @xcite . in the astrophysical context ,",
    "the suggestion that it may potentially act as a cause of magnetic field enhancement in magnetars @xcite , neutron stars @xcite and even in quark stars @xcite has been studied , as well as the role it might have in neutrino energy transport in core - colapse supernovae @xcite . some of these objects such as core collapse supernovae , reach high temperatures which makes studies of the chiral magnetic effect in such objects and in the early universe technically similar . in @xcite",
    "the formalism was extended to the case of spatially dependent @xmath13 , and in @xcite it was demonstrated that these inhomogeneities do not prevent the anomaly - driven inverse cascade .",
    "again , in all the approaches it was assumed that there are no velocity fields and therefore no turbulence occurring , although even some simple estimates seem to show that it could play a potentially important role both in the early universe @xcite and in neutron stars @xcite .",
    "velocity contributions to the mhd equations together with the chiral anomaly and the chiral vortical effect , in the framework of the early universe , were studied in @xcite . however the velocity distribution of @xcite was assumed a priori to be given by a standard kolmogorov spectrum , in general important advection term @xmath14 was neglected , and the equation guiding the fluid dynamics was not solved .",
    "recently , scaling laws  based on the scaling symmetries of the chiral mhd equations  were proposed in @xcite , but a proper understanding of the chiral mhd turbulence requires further work in the direction of obtaining concrete analytical and numerical solutions . + motivated by the above arguments , our aim will be to analytically investigate the general interplay between the chiral anomaly and mhd turbulence .",
    "we will address this important issue by solving the modified mhd equations in specific limits and discuss the general properties of the obtained solutions .",
    "this work is organized in the following manner : in  [ sec : modmhd ] the mhd equations in the presence of the chiral anomaly are reviewed and introduced ; in  [ sec : invcasc ] the behavior of the magnetic helicity is studied ; in  [ sec : perturb ] we specify regimes for the velocity field and chiral anomaly and obtain solutions to the evolution of fields in the presence of a chiral asymmetry .",
    "above the electroweak transition , for high enough temperatures where the chirality flipping processes can be ignored , one can define the chemical potential @xmath15 , associated with the approximately conserved number of right - handed electrons , @xmath16 . for lower temperatures , but still higher than the electroweak scale , one can then perturbatively add the rate of chirality flipping processes to the equations .",
    "the number of right - handed electrons is never exactly conserved due to the already mentioned abelian anomaly .",
    "taking these contributions into account we can write its change in time as @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 , is the hyper - helicity density , @xmath19 is the vector potential of the hyper - magnetic field , and @xmath20 is the chirality flipping rate before the electroweak symmetry is broken . in the standard model",
    "this leads to a chemical potential for right - handed electrons of the following form @xcite @xmath21 on the other hand if the temperature is lower than the electroweak scale  but high enough such that electron mass can be neglected  one can approximately neglect the difference between the helicity and chirality operators and introduce the density of left / right chiral electrons and respective chemical potentials , @xmath22 .",
    "these temperature conditions are also satisfied in the case of the core of a proto - neutron star . in this way",
    ", the effect of the chiral anomaly leads to the time change of the chiral chemical potential given by @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the rate comprising the chirality flipping processes of the system in question below the electroweak scale , @xmath25 is the magnetic helicity density , and @xmath26 is the vector potential . if one considers the change of energy associated with this anomaly induced chirality flow , it can in fact be shown that it corresponds to the effective electrical current [ current ] . in this work",
    "we will assume that fields are slowly varying so that chemical potentials can be treated as space - independent quantities .",
    "since the evolution equations have mathematically the same form , apart from different coefficients and flipping rates , we introduce the following notation to keep the discussion general and independent of a specific system @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the conductivity that characterizes the system of interest . taking into account",
    "the contribution of anomaly induced effective currents to the mhd equations in the resistive approximation @xcite , we can write the modified mhd equations in lorentz - heaviside units , where we have also used ohm s law , as @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31= - \\nabla p + \\left[\\sigma \\textbf{e}\\times \\textbf{b } + ( \\textbf{v } \\times \\textbf{b } ) \\times \\textbf{b}\\right ] , \\label{vel}\\ ] ] @xmath32 @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the matter density , @xmath35 is the total chirality flipping rate , and we have also added a possible source term , @xmath36 , to take into account possible processes which generate a chiral asymmetry @xmath37 in a given system . @xmath38 and @xmath39 denote from hereon both hyper and ordinary electric and magnetic fields , respectively .",
    "this approximation of the mhd equations assumes high conductivity , as well as the global neutrality of plasma , i.e. @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and the displacement current is neglected .",
    "these equations will have the same form on curved spacetime , which is of interest in the cosmological context , as long as time is replaced by conformal time and all the physical quantities are scaled with the conformal factor @xcite . in this work we will concentrate on the case of the incompressible fluid , where the continuity equation reduces to the condition @xmath42",
    ". this condition will be physically satisfied if the ratio between the fluid velocity and the speed of sound in the fluid is much smaller than unity , and we will moreover assume that the bulk flow velocity is non - relativistic .    one can easily see that if there are no initial chiral asymmetry and magnetic helicity present , then the system described by the equations - will just evolve according to the standard decaying mhd turbulence description .",
    "on the other hand , if the fields are initially helical with initially vanishing chiral asymmetry , a finite @xmath13 will in general be generated ( and vice versa ) @xcite , which implies that the evolution for later times will be different from the standard mhd description .",
    "apart from the already mentioned kinetic reynolds number , @xmath43 , it is also useful to define the magnetic reynolds number @xmath44 .",
    "a turbulent mhd regime typically corresponds to @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the analysis of equations - is mathematically simpler decomposing the ( hyper-)fields into fourier components @xmath47 focusing our attention on the evolution of statistically homogeneous and isotropic magnetic fields we obtain the condition @xcite where @xmath48 is the unit vector of @xmath49 , and @xmath50 and @xmath51 denote the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the correlator , respectively .",
    "using we can write the magnetic energy density , @xmath52 and helicity density , @xmath53 , in the volume @xmath54 as @xmath55 @xmath56    where we have introduced the spectral magnetic energy and helicity @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively . the maximal value for helicity density is achieved if all the magnetic energy is stored in one circularly polarized mode @xcite , and thus @xmath59 .",
    "this configuration of magnetic field is called maximally helical .    as usual ,",
    "the fluid part of turbulence is characterized by the kinetic energy , @xmath60 .",
    "the relative importance of kinetic over magnetic effects in turbulence will be measured by the ratio between the respective energy densities , @xmath61 , which will in general be a function of time .",
    "turbulence will develop on scales between the dissipation scale , where the reynolds number becomes small and turbulence stops due to dissipation processes , and the scale of the largest magnetic eddies .",
    "the latter is modeled by the magnetic correlation length @xmath62 and the kinetic correlation length can be defined in a similar fashion .",
    "non - linear turbulent phenomena are dominant in the inertial interval  the interval between the scales where injection and dissipation effects become relevant .",
    "since we are interested in the evolution of turbulence in the inertial interval , far enough from the dissipation scale , we can neglect the dissipation term @xmath63 in eq . .",
    "moreover , following the approach of @xcite and @xcite , we assume that the navier - stokes equation can be quasi - linearized neglecting the term @xmath64 , which is justified as long as the ratio between the fluctuating and average part of the velocity is much smaller than @xmath65 .    in order to study the evolution of magnetic energy and helicity in different regimes ,",
    "let us write the evolution of the magnetic field , described by and , in fourier space    where @xmath66 and @xmath67 . from here on",
    "we denote the integral term containing the velocity field as @xmath68    the time evolution of the power spectra @xmath69 and @xmath70 defined in and can then be derived from the magnetic field evolution by multiplying and its the complex conjugate by @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "analogously , the evolution of is obtained by multiplying by the vector potential complex conjugate .",
    "this leads to the following expressions for the spectral evolution @xmath73 @xmath74 where @xmath75 $ ] and @xmath76 $ ] .",
    "magnetic helicity , which measures the global topology of field lines by describing their linking and twisting , is an important quantity for the analysis of different mhd flow structures , and it is known to be conserved in ideal mhd , i.e. when @xmath77 .",
    "conservation of helicity can also be shown in the chiral case .",
    "starting from the definition of helicity density , as in , one has @xmath78 , and with and , it follows @xmath79.\\ ] ] using for the current @xmath80 and introducing the effective chiral current @xmath81 , eq .   can be put in a form that resembles the corresponding equation for standard mhd : @xmath82 .",
    "this means that in the limit @xmath83 , there can be no change of @xmath13 due to the chiral anomaly , even if one has an initially present chiral asymmetry .",
    "similarly , using once more eqs . and , and applying the stokes theorem , we obtain that the change of magnetic flux , @xmath84 , is given by @xmath85 therefore , in the case of ideal chiral mhd , magnetic flux will also be conserved , while in the case of finite conductivity , flux changes  corresponding to cut and reconnection of field lines ( that are no longer frozen in the plasma )  will be enhanced by the chiral anomaly .",
    "apart from the well known hydrodynamical direct cascade  energy transfer from large to small scales mhd turbulence can also undergo an inverse cascade .",
    "this energy transport of a conserved quantity from small to large scales represents an important process of self - organization of turbulent structures ( effectively measured by the correlation length ) , therefore leading to the development of order from initial chaotic conditions @xcite .",
    "helicity is known to play an important role in the establishment of inverse cascades . since , for high conductivities",
    ", helicity is a quasi - conserved quantity , short - scale modes can not be significantly washed out , and their magnetic helicity gets transferred to large scale modes .",
    "but whether the presence of helicity is a necessary condition for the development of inverse cascade is still not completely resolved . while some previous analytical @xcite and numerical @xcite analysis concluded that there is no inverse cascade for non - helical fields , some recent findings @xcite seem to show that inverse cascades may be possible even if the fields are non - helical .",
    "it was also argued that non - helical inverse cascades can exist due to scaling symmetries of the mhd equations @xcite .",
    "one of the difficulties with this issue is that in principle it may be hard to distinguish between inverse cascade and selective decay ( discussed by son in @xcite ) especially since helicity is not an exactly conserved quantity for finite conductivities . in any case",
    ", it seems obvious that the presence or absence of helicity will have an important impact on the evolution of mhd turbulence since it will strongly support an inverse cascade  even if it is not a necessary condition for it .",
    "it is essentially at this point that the chiral anomaly effect can lead to important changes in the turbulent mhd evolution , due to its property of creating helical magnetic fields from non - helical ones .",
    "we give here a general analytical discussion on the influence of the anomaly on mhd turbulence in the following manner .",
    "let us initially , starting from a time @xmath86 , consider only the non - helical mhd turbulence . according to the analytical results in ref .",
    "@xcite , which seem to be consistent with the result of numerical simulations in refs .",
    "@xcite , in this regime we consider that the magnetic energy density scales like @xmath87 such that the total magnetic energy density , @xmath52 , scales like @xmath88 .",
    "this scaling can also be introduced using simple analytical arguments , as done in ref .",
    "@xcite . using , we see that the correlation length then grows as @xmath89 .",
    "if now , at some later time @xmath90 , a finite @xmath13 is created due to some particle processes , it will then , according to , lead to a change in helicity . after some short time interval , @xmath91 there will be a finite helicity created according to @xmath92 concentrating now on the case where @xmath93 , so that the second integral can be neglected , we assume that @xmath94  obtained by solving  can be written as a power - law solution , @xmath95 ( and in fact , on a small interval @xmath96 , it can always be approximated by a power - law expansion ) .",
    "the total anomaly induced helicity density is then given by @xmath97 so that the time evolution of the induced helicity , @xmath98 , is determined by the evolution of @xmath94 .",
    "on the other hand , in the special case of @xmath99 one gets a logarithmical scaling with time @xmath100 the helicity density growth will approximately follow @xmath101 or @xmath102 as long as the term in eqs . and containing @xmath103 remains much smaller than the term containing the energy density .",
    "when the induced helicity reaches a level where it is comparable to the magnetic energy term , the above approximation can no longer be applied and one needs to consider the full set of coupled differential equations for energy end helicity density . in that regime ,",
    "even a qualitative understanding of the interrelationship between mhd turbulence and the chiral anomaly effect is not so simple , since on the one hand chiral anomaly also leads to inverse cascade @xcite , but on the other hand mhd cascade is supported by the conservation of helicity , while the anomaly effect is based on the change of helicity , as discussed above .",
    "it therefore seems natural that a system will tend to approach the state where one of the effects  either mhd turbulence or the chiral anomaly  dominates and determines the main features of its dynamics , while the other one has a minor role , which can be treated as a correction .",
    "we can first concentrate on the case where anomaly effects remain so small that the only significant contribution from the chiral anomaly is the afore discussed creation of helicity , after which helical magnetic fields follow essentially the same evolution as in standard mhd .",
    "we expect this to happen in systems characterized by high conductivities , suppressing the change of total helicity , and when the chirality flipping rates are strong compared to the source term for @xmath13 . in this regime",
    "we have the approximated scaling @xmath104 using a kolmogorov - like reasoning , i. e. assuming a constant energy transfer rate proportional to the eddy - turnover rate in the inertial interval , where the dissipation effects can be neglected , we can write @xmath105 where @xmath106 . this can be further expressed as @xmath107 \\sim - \\frac{\\rho_{m}^{5/2}\\gamma^{1/2}(1 + \\gamma)}{h_{ind}}.\\ ] ] if @xmath65 is independent of time ( which will be the case if the ratio between kinetic and magnetic energy asymptotically approaches a constant value ) the resulting scaling will be @xmath108 . therefore , even the presence of a weak chiral anomaly effect in initially non - helical mhd turbulence will tend to change the time evolution of the magnetic energy from @xmath88 to @xmath108 . this comes as a result of the anomaly induced helicity according to ( [ helind ] ) , which then plays the role of a ( quasi-)conserved quantity , leading to a slower decrease of the magnetic energy , to a faster growth of the correlation length and additionaly supports the inverse cascade .",
    "if one would use the scaling solution proposed in @xcite , a causal tail at large scales , @xmath109 , corresponds to @xmath110 and @xmath111 , then the difference induced by the chiral anomaly effect would be even larger .    at later times in the system s evolution , this initial anomaly induced helicity , @xmath112 will then lead to the realization of maximally helical fields  since magnetic fields with initial fractional helicity become maximally helical due to standard mhd turbulence @xcite .",
    "we thus conclude that the chiral mhd turbulence , when anomaly effects are small compared to the velocity and magnetic field terms , will tend to create maximally helical fields from non - helical fields .",
    "when this maximally helical state is reached , then using , we have @xmath113 , which implies @xmath114 .",
    "this represents a growth of organized turbulent structures faster than the already discussed scaling associated with .",
    "turning to the other regime , where chiral anomaly effects can not be neglected after the helicity was induced , we assume that all violation to helicity conservation comes from the time change of the anomalous chemical potential : @xmath115 , where @xmath116 . for simplicity , we will here consider only the cases where the variation of the temperature can be neglected , but this treatment can be easily extended .",
    "such is the case when the chirality flipping and source rates are either both small or compensate each other .",
    "when this is not the case , we can use the same logic that will be presented , but taking the complete eq . .",
    "it is still possible to define a magnetic integral scale , as in , at a given instance in time , but this scale will be time dependent .",
    "it now follows @xmath107 \\sim - \\frac{\\rho_{m}^{5/2}\\gamma^{1/2}(1 + \\gamma)}{\\kappa_{t } \\mu_{5 } } \\ , .\\ ] ] assuming once more that @xmath65 approaches a constant value and that @xmath13 can be approximated by a power law ( @xmath95 ) we obtain @xmath117 .",
    "if the maximally helical regime is reached , then @xmath118 .    as previously discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , when the advection term in the mhd equations is discarded , @xmath13 will have an attractor solution with @xmath119 . taking this specific value , we get @xmath120 . for this regime",
    ", we have hence independently confirmed the scaling laws recently proposed in @xcite , which were there derived using symmetry arguments .",
    "+ finnaly , we discuss the case where initially helical mhd turbulence reached inverse cascade regime with @xmath121 and then , at time @xmath90 , finite chiral asymmetry is generated due to to the particle processes .",
    "we will argue that chiral turbulence will then in general tend to develop to eather anomaly dominated or turbulence dominated regime . in the inverse cascade regime @xmath122 and therefore @xmath123 . in the case of @xmath124 asymmetry",
    "will be washed out fastly and system will evolve according to the standard mhd picture . on the other hand , when @xmath125 chiral asymmetry chemical potential will exponentially grow until it becomes significant enough that helicity can no longer be treated as constant and system exits turbulent inverse cascade regime .",
    "so , depending on the relative strength of source and flipping term , turbulence will tend to support or wash out the anomaly , as a result of helicity conservation in the inverse cascade regime .",
    "in the last section we have considered the regime of chiral mhd turbulence with no initial helicity , as well as the weak and strong anomaly regimes , in general  based on qualitative arguments .",
    "we next turn to the weak anomaly regime of the chiral mhd turbulence in more detail , i.e. when @xmath126 , with the aim of obtaining concrete solutions for the evolution of magnetic fields .",
    "we expect that the overall dynamics will in this regime be determined by the usual mhd terms ( i.e. @xmath127 case ) , and that anomaly effects will have the role of a correction to this results .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that in this case the time scale will also be determined by purely mhd considerations .",
    "namely , one can introduce typical time scales : alfvn time scale , @xmath128 , eddy time scale , @xmath129 and anomaly growth time scale , @xmath130 . here",
    "@xmath131 @xcite , with @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 and @xmath135 are the length intervals in the parallel and perpendicular directions to the magnetic field .",
    "thus , in this regime it follows @xmath136 where the last equality between the alfvn time scale and eddy time scale comes as a result of the critical balance condition in the goldreich - sridhar model of standard mhd turbulence @xcite . we can then treat the anomaly contribution to magnetic energy and helicity as a small perturbation to the standard background mhd solutions , which we label as @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "we then have @xmath139 , @xmath140 .",
    "we now add this perturbation to the equations - around @xmath141 and @xmath121 and ignore all the terms higher than the first order in perturbation .",
    "thus , to zeroth order one obtains : @xmath142 @xmath143 and to first order : @xmath144 @xmath145 where we assumed that the coupling between the chiral asymmetry , @xmath13 , and velocity can be neglected .",
    "this will for instance be the case for systems where @xmath146 , such that velocity contributions to the perturbation equation can be neglected .",
    "henceforward we focus on this regime . both equations above , for @xmath147 and @xmath148 , have a general analytical solution , namely @xmath149 and @xmath150 where @xmath151 and @xmath152 .    in order to proceed we need some analytical model for the background solutions , that is , for the standard mhd turbulence .",
    "we will therefore follow the approach proposed in @xcite .",
    "the first assumption is that the lorentz force per volume , @xmath153 , is the responsible mechanism for turbulence to occur and we therefore take @xmath154 on large scales . using the fluid - response time per unit mass @xmath155 @xcite , we simplify the velocity field to @xmath156 . based on the scaling properties of the induction equation @xcite , the drag time",
    "can be taken as @xmath157 $ ] , where @xmath158 is the initial eddy turnover time associated with a specific scale @xmath159 , @xmath160 and @xmath161 is a constant .",
    "using these approximations , and assuming gaussianity and using wick s theorem @xcite , one obtains the following equations for the background magnetic energy and helicity @xmath162 @xmath163 with @xmath164 and @xmath165 . in the case of magnetic fields with fractional helicity ,",
    "i.e. , where the initial helicity is a fraction of maximal helicity , we have @xmath166 , with @xmath167 , the solutions are @xmath168 , \\label{background1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath169 , \\label{background2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we introduced @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the evolution of this background helical field will undergo two different regimes : first , selective decay , in which modes of larger wavenumbers decay faster , and thereupon inverse cascade . in the following we focus on the influence of chiral effects in the latter , due to it being more physically significant .",
    "we consider three cases to illustrate the impact of the chiral anomaly on the field evolution , namely : a constant chiral asymmetry , @xmath172 , an asymmetry which has an attractor solution  motivated by @xcite and our discussion in ",

    "when anomaly effects are small compared to the standard mhd terms , this manifests as a slower decrease of the magnetic field with time , @xmath108 , and as a faster growth of the correlation length , @xmath187 , when compared to the evolution of initially non - helical fields predicted by the standard mhd description ( i.e. @xmath121 ) .",
    "+ we then focused on the regime where anomaly effects can not be neglected after helicity was induced . analysing the evolution of magnetic energy and correlation length in the inertial interval , using a kolmogorov - like reasoning",
    ", we obtained their scaling with time . if @xmath188 we have @xmath117 and @xmath189 .",
    "taking the special case of an attractor solution , @xmath119 , we independently confirm the scalings recently proposed in @xcite .",
    "+ we then considered the weak anomaly regime in more detail . assuming that the overall dynamics is determined basically by the standard mhd",
    ", we treat the anomaly contribution to magnetic energy and helicity as a small perturbation to the standard mhd background . ignoring all the terms higher than the first order in perturbation",
    ", we obtained general analytical solutions for the anomaly induced helicity and magnetic energy . using the analytical approximation for the background fields as previously proposed in the literature @xcite",
    ", we obtained specific solutions for the weak anomaly chiral mhd turbulence in the inverse cascade regime .",
    "the obtained solutions demonstrate how chiral effects support the inverse cascade and the growth of the correlation length in this regime .",
    "the details of such an evolution significantly depend on the scaling of the chiral asymmetry potential , @xmath13 , with time  which is determined by the relationship between source and chirality - flipping terms . in the case of @xmath13 growing with time",
    ", the induced magnetic energy and helicity also grow until the assumption of the weak anomaly regime is no longer valid .",
    "+ the chiral mhd turbulence description leads to important differences in the evolution of magnetic fields and chiral asymmetry , with respect to both standard mhd turbulence and the anomaly studies where turbulence effects are ignored .",
    "the enhanced growth of the correlation length and the suppressed decay of magnetic energy that come as a result of the interplay between turbulence and anomaly effects could thus have important consequences for different systems .",
    "therefore , the chiral mhd turbulence description could be relevant for our understanding of different open questions , such as the evolution of cosmic magnetic fields , the baryon asymmetry of the universe and the creation of magnetic fields in magnetars .",
