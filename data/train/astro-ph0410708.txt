    "the magellanic clouds , the nearest moderate sized galaxies to our own milky way , fortuitously lie in a direction well out of the plane and are relatively free of foreground extinction . as a result , they present a unique opportunity to study the process of star formation in a galaxy other than our own .",
    "n159 is a group of hii regions cataloged by @xcite who gave separate letters to distinguish between the clumps of nebulosity found within the complex .",
    "the first extragalactic protostar was discovered in the n159 complex @xcite , as well as the the first extragalactic type  i  oh maser @xcite , and the region contains an h@xmath3o maser @xcite .",
    "radio observations of the lmc with the molonglo synthesis telescope ( most , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) revealed high surface brightness , optically thin , thermal radio emission characteristic of hii regions powered by ionizing photons from ob stars .",
    "a higher resolution radio map by @xcite confirm the morphology seen in the most maps .",
    "co observations @xcite reveal a very high concentration of molecular gas at the location of n159 .",
    "@xcite searched n159 at broadband _",
    "k _ ( 2.2  ) looking for very red objects that might be the analog of sources such as bn in the milky way .",
    "they found such an object , with @xmath4  mag color and no detectable br@xmath5 emission at 2.16  @xmath6 , which they suggested was a protostar .",
    "subsequently , @xcite found a candidate protostellar object in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) while @xcite found a second candidate in the n159 complex .",
    "our understanding of ysos has advanced considerably since these discoveries ( for a discussion of low mass ysos , see @xcite and for high mass ysos , see @xcite ) .",
    "currently ysos are classified in an evolutionary sequence from class 0 to iii .",
    "class 0 stars , the youngest , show no near infrared ( near - ir ) counterpart and are detected primarily at sub - mm wavelengths .",
    "such objects will be impossible to find in n159 at present because of beam confusion with current far - ir and sub - mm facilities .",
    "class i ysos , however , typically peak in the mid - ir and have detectable near - ir flux @xcite . a class i yso may , or may not , depending on mass and evolutionary stage , be producing ionizing radiation @xcite .    the first far - ir detection of n159 was made with the air force geophysics laboratory ( afgl ) survey @xcite and a single beam observation from the _ kuiper airborne observatory _",
    "( kao ) was made by @xcite .",
    "@xcite mapped several hii regions , including n159 , using the kao at 40  resolution and found very close correspondence between the far - ir and most maps , as expected for dusty hii regions .",
    "h@xmath7 observations of n159 have revealed locations with high surface brightness that were studied by @xcite in n159a and by @xcite in n159 - 5 ( the papillon ) .",
    "the stellar content associated with n159a was studied at optical wavelengths by @xcite while the stellar content around the papillon was studied at near - ir ( _ jhk _ ) wavelengths by @xcite .",
    "there are three questions regarding star formation in n159 we wish to explore using infrared array camera ( irac , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) images obtained with the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "( _ spitzer _ , * ? ? ?",
    "first is the nature of the two protostars discovered by @xcite and @xcite . in light of our new measurements and a more contemporary understanding of very young stars , how should the two protostars in n159 be classified ? is there any evidence for additional protostars missed in the earlier near - ir surveys ?",
    "a second question we wish to address is the nature of the upper end of the initial mass function ( imf ) in the lmc .",
    "based on far - infrared ( far - ir ) observations of giant lmc hii regions , @xcite suggested n159 was producing more ionizing photons for its luminosity than it should , given their estimate of the total luminosity .",
    "perhaps the imf was weighted to producing more very massive stars than is the case in the milky way .",
    "subsequent studies in the optical , in particular @xcite , argue that the lmc has a normal imf at the extreme high mass end .",
    "our _ spitzer _ observations fill in a portion of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) missing from the earlier study by @xcite enabling a more accurate assessment of n159 s luminosity .",
    "thirdly , we seek to understand the morphology of n159 , which is larger in physical size ( @xmath8  pc ) than typical for galactic hii regions .",
    "since there is a significant reservoir of molecular gas in the vicinity of n159 , the individual components of the complex may be unrelated and simply the product of randomly initiated star formation at locations of dense molecular gas .",
    "alternatively , the morphology and stellar content may suggest a scenario where the star formation within n159 was triggered by a single , relatively recent event less than 2  myr ago .",
    "in this paper we present _ spitzer _ images of n159 using the four channels of irac with band centers at @xmath9 and @xmath10 . in ",
    "2 we describe the observations and data reduction . in ",
    "3 we examine the general morphology of the nebula and make comparisons to observations at other wavelengths . in  4 we study the point sources seen in the irac maps , including the two protostars .",
    "finally , we discuss the global properties and evolutionary state of the n159 complex and present a scenario for wind driven star formation on 50  pc scales .",
    "observations were made using all four bands of irac on _ spitzer _ as part of a guaranteed time observing program ( program i d 124 ) conducted by _",
    "science working group member r.  d. gehrz .",
    "the band centers are at 3.548 , 4.492 , 5.661 and 7.87  .",
    "the adopted zero magnitude fluxes were 277.9  jy ( band  1 ) , 179.5  jy ( band  2 ) , 116.6  jy ( band  3 ) and 63.1  jy ( band  4 ) as described in table 5.1 of the irac data handbook v1.0 .",
    "the irac images contain an off - target field of comparable area on the sky and we were able to make use of this extra data for computing star counts in band  1 ( see  4.2 ) .",
    "the raw _ spitzer _ data were processed with version 9.5.0 of the spitzer science center ( ssc ) pipeline .",
    "post - bcd processing was carried out using the 2004 june 6 linux version of the ssc legacy mopex software .",
    "four steps of mopex were implemented : cosmetic fix , background matching , mosaicker , and astronomical point source extraction ( apex ) .",
    "the cosmetic fix eliminated column pull - down and mux - bleed artifacts associated with 3.5   and 4.5  data .",
    "background matching was performed by minimizing the pixel differences in overlapping areas with respect to a constant offset computed by the program .",
    "cosmic rays and other outliers were detected and eliminated with mosaicker .",
    "the cosmetic , background matching , and cosmic ray corrections were all applied to mosaics created for each channel by the mosaicker .",
    "apex detected point sources in each basic calibrated data ( bcd ) image and computed point - spread functions ( psfs ) and aperture fluxes for each source .",
    "the psfs were created in - flight using observations of a bright star taken during in - orbit checkout ( ioc ) of the spacecraft .",
    "the n159 region contains considerable nebulosity and this often caused confusion in apex for fainter sources .",
    "we dealt with this problem by visually examining the band  1 mosaic image and eliminating any apex source that was not clearly a point source .",
    "we also set a cutoff in our point source data set at [ 3.5 ] = 16.0  mag ( corresponding to 110.6  @xmath11jy ) for this study .",
    "we made a check of the apex results by directly measuring the psf for bright sources in all four bands and comparing the area under our psf fit with the apex values .",
    "agreement was better than 3%  rms for bands  1 and 2 and about 5% for bands  3 and 4 .",
    "there were very few point sources in bands  3 and 4 since the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) for stars is falling rapidly at these longer wavelengths .",
    "several objects returned by apex as point sources were actually slightly extended in one or more bands and these are discussed in the text (  [ hii ] ) .",

    "<S> we identify two other sources that may also be class i ysos . </S>",
    "<S> one component , n159an , is completely hidden at optical wavelengths , but is very prominent in the infrared . </S>",
    "<S> the integrated luminosity of the entire complex is l @xmath0  l@xmath1 , consistent with the observed radio emission assuming a normal galactic initial mass function ( imf ) . </S>",
    "<S> there is no evidence for a red supergiant population indicative of an older burst of star formation . </S>",
    "<S> the n159 complex is 50  pc in diameter , larger in physical size than typical hii regions in the milky way with comparable luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that all of the individual components are related in their star formation history . </S>",
