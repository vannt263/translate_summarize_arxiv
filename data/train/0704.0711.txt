    "the research programme for nuclear forces , outlined more than fifty years ago by taketani , nakamura , and sasaki @xcite , treats pions and nucleons as basic degrees of freedom .",
    "this insight proved to be very fruitful . on the one hand",
    ", it implies the interconnection of all nuclear processes , both among themselves and with a class of free reactions . on the other",
    ", it determines a close relationship between the number of pions involved in a given interaction and its range . as a consequence ,",
    "the outer components of nuclear forces are dominated by just a few basic subamplitudes , describing either single ( @xmath3 ) or multipion ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , ... ) interactions .",
    "nevertheless , it took a long time for a theoretical tool to be available which allows the precise treatment of these amplitudes . nowadays , owing to the development of chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) in association with effective lagrangians @xcite , the roles of pions and nucleons in nuclear forces can be described consistently .",
    "the rationale for this approach is that the quarks @xmath7 and @xmath8 , which have small masses , dominate low - energy interactions .",
    "one then works with a two - flavor version of qcd and treats their masses as perturbations in a chiral symmetric lagrangian .",
    "the systematic inclusion of quark mass contributions is performed by means of chiral perturbation theory , which incorporates low - energy features of qcd into the nuclear force problem . in performing perturbative expansions ,",
    "one uses a typical scale @xmath9 , set by either pion four - momenta or nucleon three - momenta , such that @xmath10 gev .",
    "nuclear forces are dominated by two - body @xmath11 interactions and leading contributions are due to the one - pion exchange potential ( opep ) , which begins @xcite at @xmath12 .",
    "the two - pion exchange potential ( tpep ) begins at @xmath13 and , at present , there are two independent expansions up to @xmath14 in the literature , based on either heavy baryon @xcite or covariant @xcite chpt .",
    "the tpep is closely related with the off - shell @xmath15 amplitude and , at this order , two - loop diagrams involving intermediate @xmath16 scattering already begin to contribute .    in proper three - nucleon ( @xmath17 ) interactions ,",
    "the leading term is due to the process known as tpe-3np , in which the pion emitted by a nucleon is scattered before being absorbed by another one .",
    "it has been available since long @xcite , involves only tree - level interactions and has the longest possible range .",
    "this contribution begins at @xmath2 and consistency with available @xmath18 forces demands the extension of the chiral series for the 3np up to @xmath14 .",
    "however , the implementation of this programme is not straightforward , since it requires the evaluation of a rather large number of diagrams . with the purpose of exploring the magnitude of @xmath14 effects , in this work we concentrate on the particular subset of processes which still belong to the tpe-3np class .",
    "our presentation is divided as follows . in section [ sec : formulation ] we display the general relationship between the tpe-3np and the @xmath15 amplitude , in order to discuss how it affects chiral power counting in the former . the @xmath15 amplitude relevant for the @xmath14 potential",
    "is derived in section [ sec : pin - amplitude ] and used to construct the three - body interaction in section [ sec : tpe - p ] .",
    "we concentrate on numerical changes induced into both potential parameters and observables in sections [ sec : coefficients ] and [ sec : results ] , whereas conclusions are presented in section [ eq : conclusions ] .",
    "there are also four appendices , dealing with kinematics , @xmath15 subthreshold coefficients , loop integrals and non - local terms .",
    "potentials to be used into non - relativistic equations can be derived from field theory by means of the @xmath19-matrix . in the case of three - nucleon potentials ,",
    "one starts from the non - relativistic transition matrix describing the process @xmath20 , which includes both kernels and their iterations .",
    "the former correspond to proper interactions , represented by diagrams which can not be split into two pieces by cutting positive - energy nucleon lines only , whereas the latter are automatically generated by the dynamical equation .",
    "therefore , just the kernels , denoted collectively by @xmath21 , are included into the potential .",
    "the transformation of a @xmath19-matrix into a potential depends on both the dynamical equation adopted and conventions associated with off - shell effects .",
    "the latter were discussed in a comprehensive paper by friar @xcite .",

[ 2.9 ] the former contribution depends on just two observables , namely the nucleon mass @xmath34 and the @xmath46n coupling constant @xmath47 , as prescribed by the ward - takahashi identity @xcite .",
    "the calculation of these quantities in chiral perturbation theory may involve loops and other coupling constants but , at the end , results must be organized so as to reproduce the physical values of both @xmath34 and @xmath47 in @xmath48 @xcite .",
