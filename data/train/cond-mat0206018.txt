    "the problem of ferromagnetism in the double - exchange ( de ) model @xcite , which appears due to the hund exchange coupling between the core spins and the mobile carriers , has a long history ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) . frequently the modeling deals with the case of infinite hund exchange . in this approximation",
    "the ground state of the system is always ferromagnetic ( fm ) . to describe possible non - fm ground states of such a system one has to introduce direct antiferromagnetic exchange between the core spins",
    "however , the finite hund exchange by itself generates effective antiferromagnetic exchange , thus destroying ferromagnetism in a part of the system parameter space .    in our previous publication @xcite on the basis of dmfa we obtained the closed formula for the ferromagnet - paramagnet ( fm - pm ) transition temperature @xmath1 for the double - exchange system for arbitrary relation between hund exchange coupling and electron band width . in this paper",
    "we present a detailed study of of the boundary between fm and non - fm ground state of the system found from that formula , and , independently , from comparison of energies of the saturated fm and pm states .",
    "in addition , from the double - exchange hamiltonian with classical localized spins in the limit of large but finite hund exchange coupling we obtain the classical version of the @xmath0 model .",
    "consider the de model with random on - site energies .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model is @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the electron hopping , @xmath4 is the effective exchange coupling between a core spin and a conduction electron , @xmath5 is the vector of the pauli matrices , and @xmath6 are spin indices .",
    "we express the localized ( classical ) spin by @xmath7 with the normalization @xmath8 . to take into account the chemical disorder introduced by doping impurities , which is generic for the manganites and many other de systems , we consider the case random on - site energy @xmath9 .    in a single electron representation",
    "the hamiltonian can be presented as @xmath10 the first is translationaly invariant , the second describes quenched disorder , and the third - annealed disorder .",
    "the dmfa , as applied to the problem under consideration , is based on two assumptions .",
    "the first assumption is that the averaged , with respect to random orientation of localized spins and random on - site energy @xmath11 , locator @xmath12 where @xmath13 can be expressed through the the local self - energy @xmath14 by the equation @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the bare ( in the absence of the disorder and exchange interaction ) locator .",
    "thus introduced self - energy satisfies equation @xmath17 the system of equations ( [ local ] ) and ( [ cpa ] ) is very much similar to the well known cpa equations ( see @xcite and references therein ) , as generalized to the case when the quantities @xmath18 and @xmath19 are @xmath20 matrices in spin space @xcite .",
    "the system of equations however , is not yet closed .",
    "the averaging with respect to annealed disorder is principally different from the averaging with respect to quenched disorder .",
    "the second assumption of the dmfa is the prescription for the determining , in our case , the probability of a spin configuration self - consistently with the solutions of the eqs .",
    "( [ local ] ) and ( [ cpa ] ) . to formulate the dmfa equation for this probability , taking into account both kinds of the disorder ,",
    "let us start from the general formula for the partition function @xmath21 where @xmath22 ; @xmath23 is the matsubara frequency and @xmath24 is the chemical potential .",
    "the averaging over @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 all observables , in particular thermodynamic potential @xmath27 , should additionally be averaged over the realizations of the quenched disorder ; in particular @xmath28 the dmfa approximates the multi - spin probability @xmath29 as a product of one - site probabilities in such a way , that @xmath30 the result for the one - site probability reads ( for details of the calculation see ref .",

    "( [ prob2 ] ) , is a complicated non - linear functional of @xmath34 .",
    "however , if we are interested only in the transition temperature @xmath35 , the problem can be reduced to a traditional mean field ( mf ) equation . in linear with respect to magnetization @xmath36 approximation eq .",
    "( [ prob2 ] ) takes the form @xmath37 non - trivial solution of the mf equation @xmath38 can exist only for @xmath39 , where @xmath40 .",

    "this closed formula which takes into account both finite value of hund exchange and quenched disorder was obtained and studied by us for the first time @xcite . according to this formula the boundary between the fm and non - fm ground states",
    "is found from equating @xmath1 to zero , which reads @xmath61de=0 ; \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the fermi energy @xmath62 is found from the equation @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the number of electrons per site .",
    "thus found @xmath1 is the temperature at which the paramagnetic state became unstable with respect to small spontaneous magnetic moment .",
    "this becomes especially obvious , if we obtain the equation for the @xmath1 by constructing landau functional @xcite .",
    "independently , one may consider another approach to the same problem based on the comparison of the energies of the saturated fm state and pm state .",
    "the energy of the pm state is found from the equation @xmath65 the energy of the saturated fm state and the appropriate fermi energy are found from the equations : @xmath66\\;de\\nonumber\\\\ n=-\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\int_{-\\infty}^{e_f^{(f)}}{\\rm im}\\;[{\\rm im}\\ ;   g_{\\uparrow}(e_+)+ { \\rm im}\\ ; g_{\\downarrow}(e_+ ) ]   de,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the fm locator @xmath67 is given by the equation . @xmath68",
    "the boundary of the ferromagnetic region at the phase diagram can be found from the equality between the two energies : @xmath69 .",
    "we thus use an alternative to the second assumption of the dmfa .",
    "the boundary of the fm ground state of the system in case of no quenched disorder is presented on fig .",
    "1 .    = 2.5truein    the diagram agrees with those obtained on the basis of numerical calculations @xcite and from qualitative reasoning @xcite .    to consider the influence of chemical disorder we consider the model in which @xmath70 with the probability @xmath71 , and @xmath72 with the probability @xmath73 , thus @xmath71 being the concentration of impurities . in this model",
    "we consider the number of electrons @xmath64 and the concentration of impurities @xmath71 as two independent parameters . solving equation for the locator we obtain the boundaries which are presented on figs . 2 - 4 .",
    "it is interesting that ferromagnetism is now precluded in much larger region of the @xmath74 plane .",
    "= 2.5truein    = 2.5truein    = 2.5truein    the boundaries between the phases make sharp bends for static disorder strong enough to create a gap between conduction and impurity bands both in ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases @xcite . in this case",
    "the number of states in the impurity band is equal to the concentration of impurities , and for @xmath75 the fermi energy is in the gap . to emphasize this fact we plot the density of states both for fm and pm phases at the values of parameters @xmath76 , @xmath71 and @xmath77 which correspond to the sharp bends on figs . 3 and 4 .",

    "we express the localized ( classical ) spin by a unit vector whose orientation is determined by polar angle @xmath80 and azimuthal angle @xmath81 . in a single electron representation",
    "the hamiltonian can be presented as @xmath82 we consider the case of strong exchange : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the electron band width . in this case",
    "we should first diagonalize the exchange part of the hamiltonian .",
    "this is done by choosing local spin quantization axis on each site in the direction of @xmath85 . in this representation",
    "the hamiltonian is @xcite @xmath86 where @xmath87 the transformation to local spin quantization axis including an additional euler rotation angle , which leads to a more involved effective hamiltonian than [ hamlocquant ] , was introduced by nagaev @xcite .",
    "the next step , like it is done in the derivation of the @xmath0 model from the hubbard model @xcite , is to apply a canonical transformation @xmath88+\\frac{1}{2}[s[s , h]]+\\dots\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which excludes all band - to - band transitions .",
    "this can be achieved if we chose the operator @xmath89 in the form @xmath90 we have @xmath91_{nn'}=t_{nn'}\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}0 & b_{nn'}\\\\ b_{n'n}^ * & 0\\end{array}\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ \\left[s,[s , h^{ex}]\\right]_{nn } = 2\\sum_{n''}j_{nn''}\\left(\\begin{array}{cc }   -|b_{nn''}|^2 & 0\\\\ 0 & |b_{nn''}|^2\\end{array}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath92 .",
    "keeping terms up to the second order with respect to @xmath93 ( and only site - diagonal part of the second order terms ) we obtain @xmath94    in the second quantization form the hamiltonian ( [ hamlo ] ) has the form ( ignoring the constant term ) @xmath95 where for the case of hole doping @xmath96 is the operator of creation ( annihilation ) of the hole , and for the case of electron doping it is the operator of creation ( annihilation ) of the electron .",
    "looking at the hamiltonian obtained , we see that large but finite hund exchange dynamically generates antiferromagnetic exchange ( the second term in eq .",
