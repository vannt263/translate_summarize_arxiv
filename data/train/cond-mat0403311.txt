    "it has been argued that the phase transition at a critical applied magnetic field in certain spin systems with an excitation gap @xmath2 as for example integer - spin antiferromagnetic chains @xcite , weakly coupled two - leg ladders @xcite or three - dimensional dimer systems @xcite may be regarded as a bose condensation . in these systems",
    "the lowest excited state is a triplet of massive bosons .",
    "a magnetic field @xmath3 causes a zeeman splitting of the triplet with the lowest mode crossing the ground state at a critical field @xmath4 .",
    "the ground state for @xmath5 then becomes a bec of this low - energy boson .",
    "the density @xmath6 of the boson mode is directly related to the magnetisation per site @xmath7 . in principle , spin - gap compounds offer therefore the exciting possibility to study bec in a system where the density @xmath6 is tunable by the external magnetic field which acts as a chemical potential for the bosons .",
    "however , as the triplet excitations ( magnons ) interact via a hard - core repulsion a description as a weakly interacting bose gas is only meaningful if the average distance between the magnons @xmath8 is much larger than the s - wave scattering length @xmath9 which is the characteristic length scale representing the influence of the repulsive potential .",
    "this implies that @xmath10 so that the magnons have to be dilute . in this case",
    "the well - established gas approximation @xcite which involves a systematic expansion in terms of the small parameter @xmath11 is applicable and even the finite temperature properties of the interacting bose gas can be studied analytically @xcite .",
    "a dilute magnon gas is realized in the spin dimer system tlcucl@xmath1 in magnetic fields @xmath12 t and considerable interest has focused onto this compound within recent years @xcite .",
    "tlcucl@xmath1 has an excitation gap @xmath13  mev in zero magnetic field and a bandwidth @xmath14  mev @xcite .",
    "the dimers in this compound are formed by the @xmath15 spins of the cu@xmath16 ions and superexchange interactions are mediated by the cl@xmath17 ions .",
    "the crystal structure can be considered as two - leg ladders formed by these dimers .",
    "however , inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) @xcite has revealed that the magnons show a considerable dispersion in all spatial directions indicating that the interladder interactions are strong .",
    "tlcucl@xmath1 therefore has to be considered as a three - dimensional ( 3d ) interacting dimer system . for fields",
    "@xmath18  t a long - range magnetic ordering below some critical temperature @xmath19 has been detected .",
    "it has been shown that this transition and the overall shape of the magnetisation curves as a function of temperature can be qualitatively described as the bec of magnons @xcite .",
    "recently , the excitations for @xmath5 have been measured by ins and the lowest mode has been interpreted as the gapless goldstone mode characteristic for a bose condensed phase @xcite .    in the first part of this letter",
    "we will show how to include antisymmetric spin interactions or a staggered component of the @xmath0 tensor into a hartree - fock - popov ( hfp ) treatment @xcite of an interacting dilute bose gas .",
    "such terms will in general break the axial @xmath20 symmetry of the system so that a goldstone mode no longer exists .",
    "furthermore the condensate density becomes nonzero for all temperatures so that no phase transition occurs .",
    "these findings are in agreement with @xcite where the same type of anisotropy in a haldane spin chain has been considered .",
    "we will discuss the differences to the effect of crystal field anisotropies which can also break @xmath20 symmetry and affect bose condensation @xcite .",
    "our analysis will allow us to investigate the effects of such anisotropies on the magnon density in 3d dimer systems at finite temperatures quantitatively and we present a detailed study of the field - induced magnetic ordering in tlcucl@xmath1 along these lines in the second part of this letter .",
    "we want to restrict ourselves here to 3d spin-1/2 systems where the spin gap is due to some kind of explicit dimerisation .",
    "a useful approach to describe the excitations in such systems is the bond operator representation for spins introduced in @xcite .",
    "the starting point is the strong coupling ground state @xmath21 where each dimer at site @xmath22 is in singlet configuration @xmath23 .",
    "it is then natural to introduce operators @xmath24 which create local triplet excitations @xmath25 with @xmath26 , @xmath27 . due to hopping between the dimers",
    "the three triplet components acquire a dispersion @xmath28 with a band minimum @xmath29 at momentum @xmath30 depending on microscopic details of the exchange interactions .",
    "the triplets are subject to a hard - core constraint which can be taken into account by introducing an infinite on - site repulsion @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "note that the renormalisation of the triplet dispersion @xmath33 due to the two - particle scattering vertex @xmath34 corresponding to the interaction ( [ eq4 ] ) can be calculated exactly in the dilute limit by a summation of ladder diagrams @xcite . for magnetic fields @xmath35 and temperatures @xmath36 it is sufficient to take only the lowest triplet mode ( @xmath37 ) into account . in this case",
    "only particles near the band minimum at @xmath30 are excited so that the generally energy and momentum dependent @xmath34 can be replaced by a constant @xmath38 . with the definitions @xmath39 and @xmath40 the hamiltonian for the lowest mode",
    "is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "here we want to consider a perturbation linear in @xmath43 , @xmath44 @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a small parameter .",
    "this term respects parity and time reversal symmetry and will therefore be non - zero in general if not forbidden by additional crystal symmetries .",
    "clearly its effect will be _ non - perturbative _ at fields @xmath47 because it mixes the singlet ground state and the triplet soft mode .",
    "physically such a term can originate from _ dzyaloshinsky - moriya ( dm ) interactions _",
    "@xmath48 between spins at sites @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the dm vector . for illustration",
    "we consider the two - leg spin - ladder shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_ladder ] .    in the limit @xmath51",
    "the triplet dispersion for this model is given by @xmath52 and has a minimum at @xmath53 .",
    "consider now the additional antisymmetric exchange @xmath54 where indices @xmath55 label the two spins within the dimer as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_ladder ] . using the identity @xcite @xmath56 with @xmath57 this",
    "is easily transformed into @xmath58 .",
    "using spiral instead of cartesian indices we find in momentum space @xmath59 where @xmath43 denotes now the lowest triplet mode ( @xmath37 ) as in ( [ eq6 ] ) .",
    "this is exactly of the proposed form ( [ eq10 ] ) with the triplet operators @xmath60 acting at the band minimum .",
    "it can be shown by an exact transformation that the considered dm interaction produces an effective staggered field if a uniform magnetic field is applied @xcite .",
    "a staggered magnetic field can also originate directly from a staggered @xmath0 tensor @xcite .",
    "both effects are induced by spin - orbit coupling and can contribute to ( [ eq10 ] ) .",
    "note , however , that the interaction ( [ eq10 ] ) _ itself _ is forbidden by symmetry if there is an inversion center in the middle of each dimer irrespective of the origin of this term .",
    "next we diagonalize ( [ eq6 ] ) with the perturbation ( [ eq10 ] ) included , treating the interaction between non - condensed magnons in the one - loop ( hfp ) approximation .",
    "we want to emphasize again that taking only these diagrams into account is not an uncontrolled approximation but instead the first order in a systematic expansion in the gas parameter @xmath6 .",
    "first , we introduce new operators @xmath61 by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a real number . the density of condensed magnons per dimer @xmath64 is then given by @xmath65 . ignoring a momentum independent term , the hamiltonian splits into 2 parts @xmath66 with @xmath67 where @xmath68 denotes the density of non - condensed magnons per dimer and @xmath69 here @xmath70 with the normal self - energy @xmath71 whereas the anomalous self - energy is given by @xmath72 . by a bogoliubov transformation we find the quasiparticle spectrum @xmath73 .",
    "additionally we have to demand that @xmath74 vanishes @xmath75 to stress the differences between bec with and without @xmath76 we first briefly summarise the case @xmath77 which is the usual bec scenario for a weakly interacting bose gas in the hfp approximation . in this case",
    "we have to distinguish further between the case @xmath78 , i.e. , no magnons are condensed and the case with nonzero condensate density @xmath79 . for @xmath80 the subcondition ( [ eq14 ] )",
    "is identically fulfilled , the anomalous self - energy @xmath81 vanishes and the quasiparticle spectrum is identical to the bare triplet spectrum with an effective chemical potential @xmath82 . the density of magnons in this phase is therefore given by the usual bose distribution @xmath83^{-1}$ ] .",
    "bec occurs when the chemical potential @xmath84 vanishes so that the density @xmath85 at the critical point is given by @xmath86 . at temperatures below the critical point ( @xmath87 ) @xmath63 will be nonzero and the condition ( [ eq14 ] ) for @xmath88 becomes equivalent to the _ hugenholtz - pines _",
    "theorem @xcite @xmath89 and guarantees the existence of a goldstone mode , i.e. , the quasiparticle spectrum @xmath90 is gapless .",
    "the number of non - condensed magnons @xmath68 in this phase is given by @xmath91 whereas the number of condensed magnons can be determined from eq .",
    "( [ eq14 ] ) which has to be solved self - consistently together with ( [ eq8 ] ) .",
    "now we want to compare this with the case @xmath92 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq14 ] ) it follows immediately that this changes the situation qualitatively _ irrespective of the magnitude of @xmath46 _ because @xmath63 must be nonzero for all temperatures so that there will be always condensed magnons and no phase transition will occur . furthermore there is no longer a hugenholtz - pines theorem and consequently the quasiparticle spectrum @xmath93 is gapped .",
    "this is expected because the component of the dm interaction perpendicular to the applied field @xmath3 breaks the @xmath20 symmetry so that there is no longer a goldstone mode .",
    "using the spectrum ( [ eq15 ] ) , the non - condensed magnon density @xmath68 can be again calculated by eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) with @xmath94 being replaced by @xmath95 .",
    "the condensed density is determined by eq .",
    "( [ eq14 ] ) so that there are again two equations which have to be solved self - consistently .",
    "finally we want to discuss the difference between the perturbation ( [ eq10 ] ) originating from dm interactions or a staggered @xmath0 tensor and single - ion anisotropies @xmath96 $ ] .",
    "( exchange anisotropies have the same effect as single - ion anisotropies ) in terms of triplet operators a single - ion anisotropy produces a perturbation _ bilinear _ in the triplet operators @xmath97 ) which results from the @xmath98-term provided that the magnetic field is along the @xmath99-axis . here",
    "@xmath100 is again a small parameter and we assume @xmath101 without loss of generality . consequently the condition for the vanishing of the linear terms now becomes @xmath102 and @xmath103 does not imply @xmath104 as before . therefore a phase transition will still occur and @xmath105 for @xmath106 . the quasiparticle gap will vanish exactly at the critical point , however , it will reopen again below @xmath19 .",
    "additionally , the critical point itself will be slightly shifted .",
    "although in both cases the quasiparticle spectrum is gapped for @xmath107 , the gap only weakly depends on the condensate density for the single - ion anisotropy case contrary to what was found before ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) ) .",
    "for tlcucl@xmath1 detailed magnetisation measurements have been performed for magnetic fields @xmath35 with typical magnon densities @xmath108 @xcite satisfying the condition of diluteness .",
    "this compound is therefore particularly suited to test the predictions of the bec theory within the hfp approximation even quantitatively .",
    "this is the purpose of the remainder of this letter .",
    "tlcucl@xmath1 crystallises in the space group @xmath109 with two dimers per unit cell formed by the @xmath15 spins of the cu@xmath16 ions @xcite .",
    "because the centre of each dimer is an inversion centre , the interaction ( [ eq10 ] ) is forbidden by symmetry making , apparently , a description as a usual bec valid .",
    "to do so it is not sufficient to use a magnon dispersion of the form @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "although a quadratic dispersion is indeed expected close to the band minimum its applicability is restricted to small excitation energies and we find that this simplification here is only justified for temperatures @xmath111  k which is well below the experimental temperature range . with @xmath112 is therefore not astonishing because this exponent is a direct consequence of a quadratic dispersion . ]",
    "matsumoto _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have successfully applied the afore mentioned bond - operator technique to describe the real triplet dispersion in tlcucl@xmath1 .",
    "however , we have found that the mean - field treatment of the hard - core constraint ( [ eq4 ] ) used in @xcite is not sufficient for a quantitative comparison with the magnetisation measurements in @xcite .",
    "we therefore have calculated the renormalisation of the dispersion due to the constraint in a systematic way by a summation of ladder diagrams @xcite . doing",
    "so we find a considerable renormalisation of the superexchange parameters compared to ref .",
    "@xcite . in particular",
    "this treatment allows us to calculate the scattering amplitude @xmath113 directly and we find @xmath114 mev @xcite .",
    "additionally we note that the gap can not be determined very accurately from the ins data so that we have used @xmath115 t and @xmath116 @xcite which yield @xmath117 mev .",
    "this value was used as a constraint when calculating the renormalised dispersion .",
    "having the renormalised spectrum and @xmath113 at hand we can calculate the magnon density and therefore the magnetisation as a function of temperature within the standard bec picture .",
    "as we are interested in temperatures @xmath118 we can treat @xmath113 as temperature independent .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a .",
    "quite obviously the calculated magnetisation curves do not agree with the experimental data .",
    "we want to point out that although the jump in the magnetisation at the transition point is known to be an artefact of the hfp treatment , this approximation is reliable for a dilute bose gas apart from the small temperature interval @xmath119 @xcite where we find @xmath120 .",
    "especially the huge overestimation of the magnetisation at @xmath121 is definitely not due to an invalid approximation .",
    "taking @xmath113 as a fitting parameter we can obtain good agreement with experiment up to the minima of the magnetisation curves with @xmath122 mev yielding the best result shown in fig .",
    "a renormalisation of @xmath113 up to this value is by no means implausible as our calculation of @xmath113 takes only magnon - magnon interactions ( [ eq4 ] ) into account .",
    "raman spectroscopy , however , has revealed that low - energy optical phonons exist in tlcucl@xmath1 which interact with the spin system @xcite . as a consequence a reduction of the bare magnon bandwidth @xmath123 due to polaronic effects",
    "is expected so that @xmath113 , which is basically given by @xmath123 , might be in fact much larger .",
    "a reduction of the bandwidth by a factor 2 - 3 is not exceptional and known in polaron physics for a long time @xcite .",
    "however , even when using @xmath124 mev the theoretically calculated magnetisations are still about 50% too large at @xmath121 .",
    "more important , the standard bec scenario always predicts a sharp increase of the magnetisation below @xmath19 which _ qualitatively _ disagrees with experiment where only a slight and smooth upturn is visible .    in recent esr measurements @xcite",
    "a direct singlet - triplet transition has been observed which would be usually forbidden by spin conservation .",
    "this yields some indication that a small perturbation of the form ( [ eq10 ] ) is still present .",
    "the reason might be small static distortions which violate the exact inversion symmetry within a dimer so that @xmath76 , although certainly tiny , becomes nonzero .",
    "we therefore tried to fit the measured magnetisation curves using the outlined bec theory with @xmath76 included . because any magnetic field will then cause a finite magnetisation",
    ", @xmath125 is no longer well defined .",
    "however , fixing the gap in a range consistent with the ins data we can still use @xmath126 as a formal definition . with @xmath127  mev , @xmath128  mev and a dm interaction @xmath129  mev we can obtain excellent agreement with experiment as shown in fig .",
    "most important , even this extremely small perturbation yields smooth minima and a slow increase of the magnetisation at temperatures below the minima consistent with experiment .",
    "if @xmath46 is indeed nonzero we expect a gapped quasiparticle spectrum . in fig .",
    "[ fig1]d we therefore compare the spectrum ( [ eq15 ] ) with the ins data taken from ref .",
    "@xcite . at low excitation energies",
    "our result is in perfect agreement with these data .",
    "the deviations at higher energies are expected because our approximation @xmath130 in eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) is then no longer justified .",
    "the predicted gap @xmath131 mev is only a factor 2 smaller than the lowest measured excitation energies making it perhaps accessible in future studies .",
    "we also mention that in systems where dm interactions are allowed by symmetry they are typically of the order @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the isotropic superexchange @xcite . for a dm interaction within a tlcucl@xmath1 dimer",
    "this estimate yields @xmath134  mev which is two orders of magnitude larger than the term considered here supporting our statement that tiny violations of inversion symmetry are sufficient .",
    "however , a nonzero anisotropy term raises questions about the orientation of the dm vector @xmath50 . if @xmath50 would be oriented along a specific axis throughout the crystal as in our example in fig .",
    "[ fig_ladder ] it would be possible to restore @xmath20 symmetry by applying the magnetic field along the same axis . in this configuration a sharp phase transition would be visible .",
    "however , such dependencies on field direction have not been reported for tlcucl@xmath1 .",
    "another possibility would be that small static distortions lead to domains with different orientations of @xmath50 . in this case",
    "a component perpendicular to @xmath3 could exist for each field direction .",
    "provided that indeed no anisotropy with respect to the field direction exists we believe this is the most probable scenario taking the tininess of the needed dm term into account . in principle",
    "it is also allowed by symmetry to construct a dm term from the magnetic field itself , i.e.  it is possible that the magnetic field induces the anisotropy and therefore determines the orientation of @xmath50 .",
    "finally we want to discuss a single - ion or exchange anisotropy term as an alternative possible perturbation .",
    "as already mentioned before a sharp phase transition will still occur with such a term included .",
    "additionally , the quasiparticle gap in the condensed phase will be almost independent of @xmath64 and small for a small perturbation .",
    "we therefore do not expect any qualitative change for the magnetisation curves .",
    "explicit calculations indeed show that such a term basically yields a small shift of the critical temperature leaving the shape of the magnetisation curves otherwise unchanged ( data not shown ) .",
    "in summary , we have studied how a term @xmath76 caused by antisymmetric spin interactions and/or a staggered @xmath0 tensor affects bec in spin - gap systems .",
    "this interaction directly mixes the singlet with the triplet soft mode so that its effect is non - perturbative at magnetic fields @xmath47 . treating the magnon - magnon interaction in the one - loop approximation",
    "we have found a gapped quasiparticle spectrum compared to the gapless spectrum without @xmath76 and a nonzero condensate density for all temperatures consistent with findings in ref .",
    "@xcite for haldane spin chains .",
    "differences to the case of crystal field anisotropies have also been discussed .",
    "we have then performed a detailed quantitative study of the field induced magnetisation process in tlcucl@xmath1 and found that the scattering amplitude @xmath113 seems to be much larger than expected from magnon - magnon interactions alone . we see this as a further confirmation that spin - phonon coupling is important in this compound . finally we have pointed out that even in tlcucl@xmath1 where @xmath76 is expected to be tiny due to symmetry it seems to remain crucial to obtain a quantitative correct description of the experimental data .",
