    "the detection of isocyanic acid ( hnco ) and its isomers in different astrophysical environments is difficult to explain with current gas phase models , which suggests that these species could be formed in ice mantles and desorb to the gas phase ( quan et al .",

    "the fragmentation pattern can be used to obtain information about the spatial arrangement of the atoms in the molecule .",
    "we are mainly interested in the temperature range after water desorption has occured , when the ocn@xmath3nh@xmath24 salt , formed by an acid - base reaction , is expected to desorb as nh@xmath1 + hnco and hocn , and there is no contribution of the h@xmath0o mass fragments in the measurements .",
