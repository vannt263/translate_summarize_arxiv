    "however , as shown in fig.[fig_dos](a ) , there is a very narrow band at around the fermi energy for small @xmath42 . within the framework of the static mean - field approximation [ eq.([eq_gap ] ) ] , the narrow band can be regarded as a flat band when @xmath142 becomes larger than the bandwidth of @xmath73 ( see appendix [ sec_a_eff_fbs ] ) . to effectively explain such phenomena , we redefine the singularity weight @xmath10 as a function of the other parameters : @xmath143 .",
    "figure[fig_dos](d ) shows that , for @xmath144 , @xmath131 for @xmath47 rapidly increases from zero without a jump , which can be phenomenologically explained by an increase in @xmath10 from zero to a finite value as discussed above .",

    "we conclude that the unusual behavior @xmath160 at @xmath43 and @xmath47 results from @xmath170 , meaning that the renormalization effects greatly reduce the weight of fermions in the flat ( very narrow ) band at the fermi energy . on the other hand , as discussed above , until @xmath142 becomes comparable to @xmath171 , we can expect @xmath172 , which is consistent with what is shown in the inset of fig.[fig_double ] .",

    "generally speaking , the singularity yields @xmath236 depending on @xmath2 and also @xmath10 .    with the fbs ,",
    "the universal ratio is given by @xmath239 we find that @xmath240 ranges from @xmath241 to @xmath242 depending on @xmath2 and @xmath10 . for @xmath243 , we obtain @xmath244 @xmath245 and @xmath246 @xmath247 .",
    "this jump of @xmath240 results from the divergent term @xmath107 in the arguments of lambert functions . on the other hand , for the vhs , we obtain @xmath248 for @xmath249",
    ", we find @xmath250 for any @xmath10 .",
    "these findings indicate that the effects of the fbs ( vbs ) on the magnetism are strong ( weak ) .",
    "we should note that , for @xmath95 , the universal ratio depends only on the types of singularities , and does not depend on the weight @xmath10 .",
    "thus , we can stress that the universal ratio for @xmath251 characterizes the strength of the singularity effects .",
    "in this section , we explain why the narrow bands can be regarded as the origin of the fbs within the framework of the gap equation .",
    "we now consider a two - uniform - band ( tub ) model , whose dos is described as @xmath252 , where @xmath253 is the bandwidth of the narrower band @xmath254 scaled by that of the wider band @xmath5 .",
    "this dos is naturally regarded as the simplified dos of the 3d layered lieb lattice shown in fig.[fig_dos](a ) for @xmath47 .    as an example",
    ", we consider the gap equation for @xmath0 , which is given by @xmath255 when both @xmath256 and @xmath257 are satisfied , given @xmath207 for @xmath208 , the gap equation produces : @xmath258 this form is qualitatively equivalent to the non - singular form @xmath259 , where @xmath260 .    if @xmath261 and @xmath262 are satisfied , by using another relation @xmath263 for @xmath264 , we obtain @xmath265 .",
    "this gap equation is the same as that for the fbs as shown above in appendix [ sec_a_fbs ] , which leads to @xmath266 .",
    "thus , when the interaction strength becomes greater than the narrower bandwidth , @xmath267 , we find the linear-@xmath2 behavior of @xmath0 .",
    "we should note that here we use a relation @xmath268 .",
    "consequently , we can conclude that the very narrow band can be regarded as the origin of the ( remaining ) fbs as mentioned in sec . [ sec_weaklyinteracting ] .    here",
    ", we should comment that the above discussion is based on the static mean - field approximation .",
    "thus , we miss some effects caused by the interactions , such as the mass renormalization and the creation of the hubbard bands .",
    "simply put , the above gap equation can not be used for the strongly interacting ( heisenberg ) region , and thus , this approach may overestimate the region in which @xmath8 behavior can be obtained . note that the dmft calculations properly capture the effects mentioned above , and the dmft calculations confirm that @xmath8 behavior is obtained for small @xmath269 .    by extending the simple gap equation",
    ", we can discuss the above phenomena effectively . here , we redefine @xmath10 as a function of other parameters : @xmath143 .",
    "for example , we can expect that @xmath10 the quasi - particle weight of the fermions in the narrow band will decrease owing to the renormalization effects .",
    "this phenomenological approach can explain the characteristic behavior of thermodynamic quantities as shown in fig.[fig_double ] in the main text .",
