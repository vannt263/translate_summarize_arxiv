    "quadcopters are small rotary crafts that can be used in various environments , where they are able to maintain hover capabilities like a conventional helicopter , but are mechanically simpler and can achieve higher maneuverability .",
    "they use 4 fixed pitch propellers to control lift and a combination of propeller torques to control roll , pitch , and yaw .",
    "early designs had poor performance due to very high pilot workload .",
    "current day control techniques and small sensors have increased the popularity of the quadcopter as an autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle ( uav ) platform .",
    "the quadcopter is initially an unstable and underactuated plant with highly coupled and non - linear dynamics .",
    "these features make it an attractive experimental set - up and a system for controller design methodologies .",
    "there are 6 degrees of freedom to be controlled by 4 motor inputs and modeling the dynamics of the quadcopter is essential to understand its performance . for better understanding of plant behaviour , linearization of the nonlinear quadcopter model through analytical equations",
    "is essential , as investigated in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "another aspect of the problem is the system identification portion which has been studied in @xcite and @xcite and they form the basis for controller design and analysis .    in existing literature , there are many valuable works conducted on quadcopter analysis , and numerous practical applications of quadcopters ranging from disaster zone surveilence to photography , and so on . in this paper",
    ", we aim to provide a genuine approach in build and design of a prototype quadcopter purely based on low - cost , off - the - shelf products and arduino controllers .",
    "another unique aspect of this study is we provide a modified architecture of arduino mega software code , and through several modifications , we make it possible to implement many more advanced control methodologies on arduino mega controllers ( such as adaptive , robust , optimal , sliding mode and many more ) . even though existing pid based controllers on arduino mega boards work just fine , this removes the restriction of the code , and makes it possible to use this prototype test - bed as a research platform for the demonstration of any desired control algorithm .",
    "as it is well known from literature , due to unstable nature of quad - copter dynamics , stabilization of the quadcopter requires moving or adding stable poles in the s - plane as discussed in @xcite .",
    "popular control techniques include classical proportional integral derivative ( pid ) controllers and are studied in @xcite and @xcite",
    ". moreover , linear quadratic regulator ( lqr ) controllers are investigated in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "once a stable plant is obtained , a linearized quadcopter model is used to design desired control ( gains ) which are then applied to the actual plant dynamics . generally speaking ,",
    "the nominal position for a quadcopter is in hover mode , where the deviation from hover is calculated using inertial measurement units ( imu ) and fed back into the system for control .",
    "modern quadcopters are heavily dependent on sensor measurements but have become more popular than ever due to the improvements in imu and global positioning systems ( gps ) and their great potential for control applications . due to heavy dependency on gps and imu measurements ,",
    "complementary and kalman filtering techniques are heavily used to adjust the gps and imu measurements to provide consistent values for the controller as shown in @xcite . in some cases , depending on the assigned mission requirements , it is also possible to complement the sensor measurements with vision based tracking using live video during flight , where further details of such approach are provided in @xcite . however , robust controllers are required to stabilize the quadcopter from disturbances in an outdoor environment , as discussed in @xcite , or in fast moving references , as shown in @xcite .    in the light of these cases ,",
    "this paper discusses the integration , development , build and analysis of a quadcopter platform that is aimed to operate autonomously on pre - programmed missions .",
    "the unstable , non - linear quadcopter dynamics are stabilized using a conventional ( pid ) controller . included",
    "is the extraction of the linear model using analytical equations and system identification for comparison .",
    "but more importantly , with this study , we suggest a novel arduino based architecture that enables the use and implementation of advanced level control strategies ( such as adaptive control , robust multivariable control , optimal control , nonlinear control and so on ) with the simple ( yet effective ) architecture of arduino hardware . with this set - up",
    ", we demonstrate a fully functional and operational experimental research platform that is capable of executing autonomous guidannce and control strategies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section-[sec : modeling ] modeling of the quadcopter dynamics is explained .",
    "integration and the corresponding hardewares platforms are discussed in further detail in section-[sec : integration ] .",
    "section-[ssmsa ] explains the state space modeling of the plant dynamics .",
    "system identification is investigated in section-[sec : systemid ] and obtained models are verified in section-[sec : validation ] . with the section-[sec : conclusion ] paper is concluded .",
    "a quadcopter model consists of a cross beam structure with 4 motors on each end and collection of sets of electronic equipment .",
    "the 4 motor torques are the only inputs for a 6 degrees of freedom ( dof ) system which define the quadcopter as an underactuated system . without a controller to compensate for underactuation , there are 2 states that can not be directly commanded .",
    "this , eventually , will cause a drift to undesired values over time .",
    "the motors are stationary and do not have any mechanical linkages to change the blade pitch . in that sense ,",
    "the quadcopter utilizes a combination of the four motor torques to control all the states .",
    "the testbed is designed using the x - formation shown in diagrams of figure [ fig : quaddyn ] .",
    "one pair of propellers ( @xmath18 and @xmath20 ) rotate clockwise ( cw ) while the other pair of propellers ( @xmath19 and @xmath21 ) rotate counter - clockwise ( ccw ) .    to command throttle",
    ", all four propellers must rotate at the same speed which provides a vertical force in the z - axis .",
    "if each propeller provides a quarter of the weight in thrust , the quadcopter will hover .",
    "rolling motion is generated by either increasing or decreasing the torque in pair of motors on the left side ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) while applying an opposite increase or decrease to the right pair of motors ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) .",
    "this produces a torque in the x - axis which creates the rolling motion .",
    "pitching motion is generated by increasing / decreasing the front motors ( @xmath18 and @xmath21 ) while applying the opposite action ( increase / decrease ) to the rear motors ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) .",
    "this combination produces a torque in the y - axis which creates a pitching motion .",
    "yawing motion is generated by increasing / decreasing the cw motor pair while applying the opposite action ( increase / decrease ) to the ccw motor pair .",
    "this combination produces a torque in the z - axis which creates a yawing motion .",
    "the quadcopters non - linear , coupled equations of motion ( eoms ) have been analyzed extensively in literature and are summarized below for convenience , where further detailed derivations are provided in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these eoms are derived by applying newton s @xmath25 law to the quadcopter body .",
    "some of the basic assumptions include that i ) the quadcopter is a rigid body and ii ) it is symmetrical along the x and y axes .",
    "@xmath26    the outputs of the eoms are translational velocities u , v , w ; rotational velocities p , q , r ; positions x , y , z ; and the attitude angles @xmath22 , @xmath24 , and @xmath23 .",
    "these outputs are calculated by integrating the eoms , given in eq .. the inputs of the eoms are the propeller speed inputs where @xmath27 are associated with throttle , roll , pitch and yaw respectively . here , @xmath17 is the sum of the propellers rotational speed .",
    "these inputs are functions of the propellers rotational speed @xmath28 , where lift and drag factors of the propeller blade ( b and d respectively ) and length l. here , lift and drag factors of the propeller blade ( b and d respectively ) are calculated from the blade element theory @xcite . from the quadcopter dynamics discussed in section [ motordynamics ] , the inputs can be expressed as shown in eq.([motoreqns ] ) .",
    "@xmath29      a linearized model of the eoms are desired to analyze quadcopter behavior at an operating point where all states are effectively zero . for the quadcopter",
    ", the operating point is selected as the hover condition where the motors provide enough thrust to counteract the force of gravity .",
    "matlab is used to linearize the model dynamics ,     equation , where the remaining equations follows the same . ]    where figure [ fig : udotsimulink ] demonstrates one of the 6 non - linear eoms that are modeled in simulink .",
    "the function block contains the @xmath30 equation .",
    "this block is integrated twice to obtain the velocity u and position x. the control system toolbox embedded linmod function is utilized to extract the linear state space model ( ssm ) .",
    "the same procedure is repeated for the remaining equations .",
    "the quadcopter testbed is built and assembled from scratch . a standard thrust to weight ratio of 2 and above",
    "is kept for maneuverability of the quadcopter .",
    "this directly results in a desire for small , lightweight components .",
    "utilization of low cost components is one important figure of merit but the reliability of each part is also taken into account extensively .",
    "the total cost of the quadcopter is around $ 388 ( without a gopro camera ) and a breakdown of the off - the - shelf components can be seen in table [ table.cost ] .",
    "the testbed ( in its current condition ) can be seen in figure [ fig : quadphoto ] .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table.pidgains ]    the goal is to use these values as a starting point to achieve a stabilized closed - loop system .",
    "the pid gains are further tuned to the pilot s preference to perform sweeping maneuvers for system identification .",
    "although the quadcopters eoms are coupled , pid controllers for the other states ( such as translation ) are not necessary because the disturbances are relatively small compared to the roll and pitch angles .",
    "the closed loop response of the quadcopter system with the pid values from table [ table.pidgains ] are shown in figure [ fig : pid ] .",
    "it is clear from figure [ fig : pid ] that roll , pitch , and yaw responses are stable and return back to the trim value at zero within a second . since there is no closed loop control on position , translational motion(x , y , z ) of the quadcopter will have small steady state errors , which are relatively small and therefore negligable .",
    "as stated in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , it is well known that system identification can be used to develop a linearized ssm using experimental flight data .",
    "this involves mapping a known input signal to the flight data response in the frequency domain to obtain the transfer function of the corresponding state .",
    "once this is achieved for all 6 states of the system , the model structure can be built from the estimated transfer functions for further theoretical / simulational analysis .",
    "the goal is to compare and verify the system identification model with actual quadcopter experimental data .",
    "the identification process starts with retrieving frequency domain sweep data via a chirp signal .",
    "a chirp signal is essentially a sinusodial function which starts at a low frequency and slowly increases to higher frequencies to cover ( and excite ) all the different modes of the system .",
    "the sweep , in our case , is implemented manually through a pilot input and is applied to roll , pitch , and yaw states with the output data for angles and rates being logged for analysis in @xcite .",
    "a sample sweep in roll from the pilot input is shown in figure [ fig : sweep ] .",
    "the magnitude and frequency of the sweep command vary since a pilot input is not perfect , but it still provides valuable data for analysis .     of a set of sweep data .",
    "]      for system identification analysis , the student version of @xcite ( comprehensive identification from frequency response ) is utilized .",
    "it is an identification software that is designed to use time domain test data to extract frequency domain models in the form of transfer functions and/or state space models . in this study ,",
    "only angular modes were able to be analyzed because the translational measurements were not precise enough for analysis .",
    "the resulting identified siso transfer functions for roll and pitch are shown in eq.s ( [ equation.rolltf ] ) - ( [ equation.pitchtf ] ) .",
    "@xmath31    @xmath32    @xmath33    where associated time delays are @xmath34,~~ \\tau_2 = 0.2[sec],~~ \\tau_3 = 0.0592[sec]\\ ] ]    the transfer functions obtained from automated sweeps are acceptable as determined by the coherence shown in figure [ fig : coherence ] .",
    "all three figures show that the coherence varies around 0.8 to 1 .",
    "this also shows a large improvement in using automated chirps compared to using manual pilot chirps .",
    "the manual chirp coherence for roll can be seen in figure [ fig : coherencemanual ] which shows that lower frequencies are adequate but at higher frequencies , the sweep data is not consistent enough past @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "the coefficient in the exponential term represents the time delay from the input to output .",
    "following to identification results , derived dynamics are compared with the actual flight data to verify the accuracy of the model dynamics .",
    "the input signals are manual piloted doublets and the results are compared with actual flight data .",
    "the result of roll and pitch doublets are shown in figure [ fig : doublet ] using the transfer function from equations [ equation.rolltf ] and [ equation.pitchtf ] .     transfer function.,title=\"fig : \" ]   transfer function.,title=\"fig : \" ]   transfer function.,title=\"fig : \" ]    it can be seen that the time delay of the transfer function matches up with the actual system very well .",
    "the roll angle transfer function doublet magnitude also matches up with flight data but the pitch angle transfer function does reach the correct magnitude , even though the high coherence implies that they should match .",
    "the reason for lower magnitude is because the transfer function that @xmath0 extracts is a lower - order equivalent system ( loes ) .",
    "this siso transfer function can be used as an initial model , but it does not account for the quadcopter dynamics that may be of a higher order and involve coupled dynamic behavior .",
    "a complete ssm is desired so that it can be used as for analytic modeling and verification .",
    "however , a complete ssm could not be extracted due to a lack of consistent measurements .",
    "the problem lies in gathering correlatable off - axis chirp data .",
    "identification of a ssm model requires accurate measurements for off - axis state to account for the coupling dynamics .",
    "it can be seen from the previous section that on - axis data has high coherence , but the off - axis coherence is contaminated with noise , or woud have low coherence at certain frequencies due to using filtered data .",
    "the only set of data that @xmath0 did not error on was the yaw input to yaw rate output which had low coherence in the 20s .",
    "different filter values and chirp magnitudes were tested for multiple flight tests but almost all trials resulted in a low coherence in the ssm identification .",
    "in this study , we provided a process of assembling an autonomous , low - cost , off - the - shelf product based quadcopter platform from scratch .",
    "we designed control laws to stabilize it using an arduino mega .",
    "the eoms for a quadcopter have been studied and a linear state space model was extracted for analysis .",
    "the quadcopter testbed was assembled and programmed using the arduino mega to be flown using a dx-6 controller .",
    "one novelty we presented in this paper is that we provide a modified , novel version of arduino code which is not restricted to pid controllers only , and can be extended to more advanced control methodologies due to its modular and highly flexible structure . for state measurements , the imu and gps have been calibrated with a many different types of filters .",
    "a closed loop pid is designed in simulink using the state space model to stabilize non - linear plant dynamics .",
    "the closed loop controller has also been coded into the arduino mega . with this design ,",
    "flight data is recorded on the micro sd card for analysis .",
    "transfer functions for roll and pitch were identified and verified using doublet data from real flight .",
    "ssm extraction becomes problematic due to problems with low signal - to - noise ratio and low coherence of off - axis data , and is currently and on - going search where the results will be reported in another study .",
