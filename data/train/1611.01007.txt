    "one of the areas of application of these less well known conservation laws is envisioned to be the manipulation of chiral matter with chiral light @xcite .    in this article , and motivated by the growing number of interesting conservation laws , we develop a unified theory for the analysis and engineering of the transfer of properties from the electromagnetic field to material systems .",

    "it seems physically justified to restrict the measurable properties of the field to those in which the exchange @xmath16 is real valued .",

    "changes that are more substantial than translations and rotations may also happen , for example , if the field deforms the object significantly . in many situations we expect that the time scale in which @xmath0 changes will be much longer than the time needed for reaching a steady state in the outgoing flux . as long as the two time scales are distinct enough , a piece - wise steady state can be assumed and the methodology applied with a constant @xmath0 .",
    "then , after some period of time , a new @xmath0 operator may be considered taking into account the changes that the field has produced in the object , and so on .",
