    "unique electronic , mechanical and structure properties of  carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) continue to be a focus of extensive investigation to date ( see refs .   and as well as the references therein ) . for one ,",
    "it is considered to be the ultimate system for continued `` scaling '' beyond the end of the semiconductor microelectronics roadmap.@xcite at the same time , recent studies  @xcite drew attention to other important applications of cnts .",
    "their crystalline properties with low or no impurity incorporation allow the injection and use of electrons with polarized spin as an added variable for computation .",
    "thus , cnts are an ideal medium for the development of the new emerging field of spintronics .",
    "@xcite further , the anticipated long spin relaxation times allows coherent manipulation of electron spin states at an elevated temperature , opening a significant opportunity for spin - based quantum information processing .",
    "@xcite clearly , spin dependent properties of cnts warrant a comprehensive investigation with the spin relaxation times / processes as one of the most crucial .",
    "recently , electron spin relaxation in the cnts was examined theoretically by considering the hyperfine interaction ( hfi ) with nuclear spins @xmath1 of @xmath2c isotopes ( with the natural abundance of @xmath3 ) .",
    "@xcite the hfi is thought to be the most important spin relaxation process with the role of spin - orbit coupling routinely dismissed on the ground of its weakness in the carbon - based structures .",
    "however , the calculation result predicts the electron spin relation time of the order of one second ; a number much longer than that experienced experimentally .    in the present work ,",
    "we reexamine the role of spin - lattice interaction on electron spin relaxation in semiconducting cnts .",
    "although the @xmath4-tensor anisotropy caused by the spin - orbit coupling does not lead to spin relaxation , it can provide an effective mechanism when combined with specific thermal vibrations of the cnt ( namely , the flexural phonon modes ) . indeed , any bending of the cnt is accompanied by local rotation of the tube axis and , thus , the principle axes of @xmath4-tensor .",
    "consequently , the electron zeeman energy under a magnetic field will be affected by thermal vibrations through the local angular displacement of the tube axis , leading potentially to electron spin relaxation .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the spin - phonon interaction hamiltonian is derived in terms of flexural vibrations and the cnt @xmath4-tensor components . in secs .",
    "iii and iv , this hamiltonian is applied to the problem of spin - flip relaxation in a magnetic field for electrons localized in a finite segment of a cnt ( analogous to a quantum dot ) and for delocalized electrons . finally , sec .",
    "v discusses the numerical results through comparison with the hfi - induced spin - flip processes .",
    "a range of parameter space is identified where the proposed mechanism may provide a dominant contribution .",
    "consider an electron under a magnetic field @xmath5 .",
    "the zeeman hamiltonian in an undisturbed cnt can be written in the frame of reference with the axis @xmath6 directed along the tube as @xmath7where @xmath8 is the bohr magneton , @xmath9 an electron spin , @xmath10 and @xmath11 with the principal values of electron @xmath4-tensor @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 . in the presence of flexural thermal vibrations ,",
    "the system loses the axial symmetry .",
    "if the curvature induced by flexural deformation is small ( compared to the cnt diameter ) , one can introduce local cartesian axes @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 at each point along the cnt ( fig .",
    "the angle between the @xmath6 and @xmath17 axes is defined as @xmath18 .",
    "then , the zeeman hamiltonian in the presence of flexural vibrations can be expressed in the local coordinate system ( denoted as @xmath19 ) by simple substitution @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 in eq .",

    "the angular displacements @xmath32 and @xmath30 are immediate from the transversal deformation @xmath37 , so that    @xmath38    in turn , the @xmath39 can be expressed in terms of flexural modes .",
    "the latter are the two transversal acoustic modes that have orthogonal polarizations @xmath40 @xmath41 ( we fix their direction along @xmath20- and @xmath21- axes correspondingly ) and possess a quadratic dispersion for mode frequency @xmath42with wave number @xmath43 and polarization @xmath44.@xcite parameter @xmath45 in eq .",

    "the diagonal matrix elements can also be responsible for the phase spin relaxation providing the finite phonon lifetime,@xcite we however skip this possibility assuming that phase spin relaxation is conditioned by spin - flip processes .",
