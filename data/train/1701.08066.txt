    "the karlsruhe tritium neutrino ( katrin ) experiment aims at determining the neutrino mass in a model independent way from the kinematics of tritium @xmath1-decay .",
    "the observable in this case is an  average electron anti - neutrino mass  given by the incoherent sum of neutrino mass eigenstates weighted by the squared elements of the mixing matrix .",
    "the experiment combines a windowless gaseous tritium source ( wgts ) and a high resolution electrostatic retarding spectrometer ( mac - e filter ) to measure the spectral shape of @xmath1-decay electrons close to the endpoint energy at 18.6  kev with an unprecedented precision .",
    "katrin s sensitivity to the neutrino mass will be 0.2  ev / c@xmath0 ( at 90% c.l . ) after 3 years worth of data taking  @xcite .",
    "an observed mass signal of 0.35  ev / c@xmath0 will have a @xmath2 significance at the expected level of statistic and systematic uncertainties . in order to reach the desired sensitivity ,",
    "all systematic effects of the measurement must be well under control with the major systematic uncertainties being allowed to contribute no more than @xmath3 to the systematic error budget .",
    "an overview of the katrin experiment is shown in figure  [ fig : katrin ] .",
    "the experiment starts with the wgts where    , scaledwidth=95.0% ]    molecular  gas is injected at the center of the source and removed at both ends by turbo - molecular pumps .",
    "the  gas is kept at a constant temperature of 30  k within the source that is operated at a column density of @xmath4 .",
    "the operational parameters of the source cryostat are monitored by a complex sensor network and a dedicated calibration and monitoring section at the rear of the source system  @xcite . about @xmath5 @xmath1-decay electrons",
    "are emitted per second into the accepted forward solid angle with pitch angles less than @xmath6 and are guided magnetically through the transport section to the spectrometer tandem consisting of pre- and main - spectrometers .",
    "the task of the transport section made up of a differential pumping section and a cryo - pumping section is to suppress the flow of  molecules into the direction of the spectrometers by at least a factor of @xmath7 in order to reduce experimental background from tritium decays within the spectrometers .",
    "a first energy discrimination is performed by the pre - spectrometer which rejects the low energy part of the @xmath1 spectrum ( up to 300  ev below the endpoint ) and thereby reduces the rate of electrons going into the main spectrometer to approximately  @xmath8 . like the pre - spectrometer the main spectrometer operates as a so - called mac - e filter  @xcite and has the task to perform a precise energy analysis of the decay electrons .    in a mac - e filter electrons",
    "are guided magnetically against an electrostatic retardation potential that can only be surpassed by electrons with sufficiently high longitudinal energy with respect to the electric field . here",
    "the longitudinal energy is given by @xmath9 with @xmath10 being the kinetic energy of the electron and @xmath11 being the angle between electron momentum and magnetic field direction .",
    "the transverse energy is accordingly given by @xmath12 .",
    "the spectrometer acts as a high pass filter with a transmission function describing the observed electron rate as a function of the electron surplus energy ( see section  [ sec : resp ] ) . to reduce the amount of transversal energy of the electrons that is not analyzed by the spectrometer",
    ", the technique of magnetic adiabatic collimation is used .",
    "the idea is that the magnetic guiding field drops by several orders of magnitude from the entrance of the spectrometer to the analyzing plane , where the electric potential reaches its maximum .",
    "if the gradient of the magnetic field is small enough , such that the field is approximately constant along one cyclotron loop of the electron movement , the magnetic moment of the cyclotron motion @xmath13 ( non - relativistic ) is constant , and as @xmath14 drops the transversal energy of the electrons is converted into longitudinal energy @xmath15 that can be analyzed by the spectrometer . by varying the electric potential of the spectrometer",
    "it is then possible to scan the relevant region around the endpoint energy of tritium @xmath1-decay and accumulate a spectrum .",
    "electrons with sufficient energy to pass the spectrometer are finally detected by a 148 pixel silicon pin detector  @xcite at the end of the setup .    among the main systematical uncertainties of the experiment",
    "are energy losses from inelastic scattering of electrons in the source , fluctuations of the source density , fluctuations of the spectrometer analyzing potential , uncertainties in the transmission function and uncertainties in the final state distribution of the daughter molecules left after the decay reaction",
    ". a sophisticated calibration and monitoring system is being set up to keep the aforementioned systematic effects under control . while there is some information on the energy loss of 18.6  kev electrons in gaseous tritium or",
    "quench condensed deuterium from the former neutrino mass experiments in troitsk and mainz  @xcite , precise experimental information on energy losses of electrons with energies near the endpoint of the tritium @xmath1 spectrum are only available for molecular hydrogen as target gas  @xcite .",
    "a measurement of the energy differential scattering cross section of 18.6  kev electrons off molecular tritium is therefore highly desirable .",
    "such a measurement can be performed using a monoenergetic source of electrons mounted upstream of the wgts to determine the response function of the overall experiment at different column densities of the source .",
    "a deconvolution method suitable to extract the energy loss function from the data will be presented in the following sections .",
    "once the energy loss function for tritium is known with sufficient accuracy , the same measurement setup can be used for an independent check of the column density of the wgts during intervals between the regular measurement cycles of the katrin experiment  @xcite .",
    "the processes contributing to the energy loss of electrons traversing the molecular tritium gas within the wgts are excitation of rotational and vibrational states of the t@xmath16 molecules , excitation of electronic molecular states , dissociation and ionization of the molecules .",

    "@xcite report on measurements of energy losses of electrons in gaseous tritium and in quench condensed deuterium films .",
    "because of the limited energy resolution of a few ev the shape of the energy loss spectrum was not directly extracted from the data in their analysis , but approximated by a gaussian representing electronic excitations and dissociation and a one - sided lorentzian curve representing the continuum caused by ionization of the molecules .",
    "the parameters of the two functions were then adapted to fit the observed integral energy spectra obtained with an 18.6  kev mono - energetic electron source for gaseous tritium or from 17.8  kev mono - energetic conversion electrons from a @xmath17kr film covered by various thicknesses of d@xmath16 absorbers . in both cases , energy losses caused by rotational and vibrational excitations of the molecules without electronic excitation",

    "it is then equal to the analytical transmission function of the spectrometer @xmath37 convolved with a function @xmath38 describing the energy spread and angular distribution of the electron source @xmath39 in the simulations , the energy spread of the source is described by a gaussian smearing of the energy setpoint with a width of @xmath40  ev .",

    "if we further take into account that the magnetic field at the location of the electron source will be lower than the field within the wgts , the starting angles have to be transformed according to @xmath55 resulting in angles @xmath11 of electron momenta relative to the magnetic field direction within the wgts .",

    "secondly this equation also assumes a homogeneous distribution of tritium molecules in transverse direction within the wgts .",
    "compared to scattering probabilities extracted from the simulations accounting for scattering angles in elastic and inelastic scattering described in section  [ sec : mc ] the deviations to the results calculated with  [ eq : pnav ] were found to be on the @xmath58 level , however .",

    "two different algorithms to deconvolve the energy loss function from the single scattering function extracted from the measurements have been tested : firstly , the so - called singular value decomposition ( svd ) , and secondly , the stabilized biconjugate gradient ( bi - cgstab ) method as an example of an iterative algorithm . both methods allow to obtain an approximation of the real energy loss function with varying levels of detail and of numerical fluctuations in the deconvolved result . the numerical noise can be dampened in the case of the svd algorithm by setting an appropriate threshold value for the suppression of small singular values and in the case of the bi - cgstab algorithm by filtering the deconvolved function . when applying the deconvolved energy loss function to the analysis of simulated integral @xmath1 spectra , we find that the svd method delivers usable results that induce a systematic error below the error budget of @xmath147 allocated for this contribution in the katrin design report . the bi - cgstab method , however , significantly exceeds the limit , both for the direct and for the filtered result of the deconvolution .",
    "an option to improve the result from svd deconvolution that has been looked at during simulations is to split the energy loss function into several energy intervals and perform a sectionwise deconvolution of the data . in this way it is possible to choose lower threshold values in the regions of rotational and vibrational states and of inelastic electron excitations where",
    "more structure is expected and to dampen numerical fluctuations by higher threshold values in between these regions and in the ionization tail , where we know that the curve is smooth .",
    "with such an approach it was indeed possible to get a closer approximation of the fine structure observed in the input model of the energy loss function . however , the energy loss function deconvolved in this manner led to larger systematic errors in the fits of the neutrino mass spectra and was therefore discarded .",
    "further improvements of the deconvolved results are possible by increasing the statistics of the response function measurements . in the simulations",
    "we have assumed to collect 10 million events at each voltage step of the measurements .",
    "assuming an event rate of 25  khz this would result in about 10 days measurement time plus overhead , e.g. , for switching between voltage settings during the measurements and for changing the column density of the wgts in between runs .",

    "however , also this action comes at the cost of increased measurement time , as this would require to measure at yet an additional , higher column density setting of the source .",
    "finally it could be investigated if going beyond the present precision might be possible by applying bayesian methods as used to reconstruct spectral functions in lattice qcd  @xcite .",
