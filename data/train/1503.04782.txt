    "polyominoes are two dimensional objects which are originally rooted in recreational mathematics and combinatorics .",
    "they have been widely discussed in connection with tiling problems of the plane . typically , a polyomino is plane figure obtained by joining squares of equal sizes , which are known as cells . in connection with commutative algebra ,",
    "polyominoes are first discussed in @xcite by assigning each polyomino the ideal of inner 2-minors or the _ polyomino ideal_. the study of ideal of @xmath0-minors of an @xmath1 matrix is a classical subject in commutative algebra .",
    "the class of polyomino ideal widely generalizes the class of ideals of 2-minors of @xmath1 matrix as well ass the ideal of inner 2-minors attached to a two sided ladder .",

    "we denote by @xmath4 , the polyomino ideal attatched to @xmath2 , in a suitable polynomial ring over @xmath3 . the residue class ring defined by @xmath4 denoted by @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "it is natural to investigate the algebraic properties of @xmath4 depending on shape of @xmath2 .",
    "the classes of polyominoes whose polyomino ideal is prime has been discussed in many papers . in @xcite",

    "in @xcite they introduced the class of _ balanced _ polyominoes and proved that polyomino ideal of balanced polyominoes are prime . later in @xcite",
    "it is shown that simple polyominoes are balanced . in @xcite , independently from @xcite , it is proved that polyomino ideal of simple polyominoes are prime by identifying them with toric rings of edge rings of graphs .",
    "very recently , in @xcite it is shown that polyomino ideal of polyomino of the shape `` rectangle minus convex '' is prime by using localization argument on the attached rings of those polyominoses .    in this paper",
