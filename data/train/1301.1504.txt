    "examples of quantum computing processors performing quantum - gate operations typically involve superconducting qubits @xcite that couple strongly to electromagnetic fields . to couple the memory and computing units , previous proposals normally considered a common transmission line resonator as the quantum data bus and employed either electric - dipole or magnetic - dipole interactions @xcite .",
    "magnetic interactions are more desirable due to the sufficiently long coherence times achieved in systems with spin states storing quantum information .",

    "the eigenstates of the flux qubit are superpositions of clockwise and counterclockwise persistent current states , and the energy levels are typically separated by a few ghz @xcite .",
    "an nv center has an @xmath6 ground state with zero - field splitting @xmath7 ghz between the @xmath8 and @xmath9 states . by introducing an external magnetic field along the crystalline axis of the nv center",
    ", an additional zeeman splitting between @xmath9 sublevels occurs .",
    "thus , a two - level system with sublevels @xmath8 and @xmath10 [ see fig.[fig1 ] ( b ) ] can be isolated .",
    "we will first derive the hamiltonian of the hybrid system consisting of a flux qubit and an nve [ see fig.[fig1 ] ( a ) ] , and then obtain the total hamiltonian of the proposed hybrid quantum circuit in fig.[fig1](c ) .      in the memory unit proposed here , the nv center can be described by the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the ground - state zero - field splitting , @xmath13 are the usual pauli spin-1 operators , @xmath14 is the ground - state strain - induced splitting coefficient , @xmath15 is the ground state @xmath16-factor , and @xmath17 is the bohr magneton . in this paper , we set @xmath18 .",

    "these two persistent - current quantum states of the flux qubits give rise to different anti - aligned magnetic fields : @xmath23 .",

    "when @xmath90 , the system state will remain unchanged with time .",
    "thus , the quantum storage process , @xmath91 can be realized perfectly in the resonant interaction case . in order to further explicitly show the generation of high - fidelity quantum storage , we plot in fig.[fig2 ] the quantum - storage - fidelity versus the dimensionless time @xmath57 . here the fidelity is defined as @xmath92 ( here @xmath93 is the target state of quantum storage ) and this figure shows that the quantum storage process can be deterministically realized at an appropriate time . in other words ,",
    "the maximum fidelity for implementing quantum storage can reach up to one in the parameter regime : @xmath62 , and @xmath94 .",
    "notice that the above discussion is in the ideal situation , where the corresponding undesired transitions from the computation basis to other subspace are neglected and the frequencies of the flux qubits are fixed .",
    "experimentally , the above quantum storage is implemented by tuning the frequencies of the flux qubits .",
    "first , the flux qubit @xmath69 is initially resonant with the nve , but largely detunes from the flux qubit @xmath68 , i.e. , @xmath95 . in this situation ,",
    "the interactions between the flux qubits @xmath69 , @xmath68 and the nve are negligible when flux qubit @xmath69 and the nve are sufficiently apart from each other .",
    "second , we prepare the flux qubits @xmath69 , @xmath68 and the nve to their initial states , and bring the flux qubit @xmath68 in resonance with flux qubit @xmath69 and the nve during a ramp time @xmath33 using a pulse , i.e. , @xmath96 ( the ideal situation corresponding to @xmath97 ) . see the inset of fig.3 .",
    "finally , we wait for a specific time as shown above , and then bring the qubit @xmath68 back to the initial detuned position with another pulse @xcite .    summing up the above discussion , the ideal parameter regime , i.e.",
    ", @xmath97 , @xmath62 , and @xmath94 , is necessary in order to obtain the perfect quantum storage process .",
    "however , the idea parameter conditions could not be satisfied exactly in practical situations . in order to study the influences of parameter mismatches on the fidelity of quantum storage , we plot @xmath98 against the ramp time of pulse @xmath33 , detunings @xmath99 , @xmath100 and the coupling mismatch @xmath101 in figs.[fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] .",
    "figure[fig3 ] shows that the quantum - storage - fidelity is robust with the ramp time @xmath33 , and high - fidelity quantum storage can still be obtained even for a finite ramp time .",
    "for example , by choosing the flux - nve coupling strength @xmath102 mhz , the fidelity of quantum storage can still reach up to @xmath103 when the ramp time @xmath104 ns and the initial frequency detuning @xmath105 mhz .",
    "furthermore , it is clearly shown from fig.[fig4 ] that the quantum - storage - fidelity is insensitive with respect to the fluctuations of parameters @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath106 . as a result",
    ", the quantum storage process can still be realized with high fidelity even though the ideal parameter conditions could not be satisfied exactly in practical situations .    here it should be noticed that the quantum storage process can also be realized in a single flux - qubit - nve system @xcite",
    ". however , in the single flux - qubit - nve system , it is necessary to apply additional pulse sequences on the memory ( or computing ) unit in order to eliminate the influence of the quantum computing process on the quantum memory .",
    "this requirement increases the difficulty of experimentally realizing a high - fidelity quantum storage .",
    "next , we will show that the above problem can be solved by separating the quantum computing and memory units in our proposal ( see fig.[fig1](c ) ) .    as shown in fig.[fig1](c ) , an external current @xmath3 is used to perform the quantum computing process .",
    "the magnetic field strength at a distance @xmath107 away from the external current @xmath3 is @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the permeability of the vacuum . to estimate the coupling strength @xmath110 between the external magnetic field and the flux qubit c",
    ", we note that @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the magnetic dipole of the flux qubit induced by the circulating persistent current of magnitude @xmath113 and @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the area of the flux qubit c. when the frequency of the external magnetic @xmath116 is resonant with the transition frequency @xmath117 , this coupling hamiltonian can be written as @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the rabi frequency .",
    "similarly , the interaction of the external magnetic field @xmath120 with the nv center can be written as @xmath121 , where @xmath122 , @xmath15 and @xmath17 have the same meaning as in section ii .",
    "considering the magnetic field @xmath120 along the @xmath123 axis ( perpendicular to the crystalline axis of the nv center ) and applying the rwa , the interaction hamiltonian between the external magnetic field and the nve can be written as @xmath124 , where @xmath125 here the resonant condition between the flux qubit c and the nv - center has been used .",
    "based on the above discussion , it should be noticed that the external magnetic field will influence the quantum memory unit ( nve ) when a single qubit rotation is applied on the quantum computing unit ( flux qubit c ) . as an example",
    ", we consider that a single qubit operation ( rotating @xmath126 angle ) on the flux qubit c is firstly implemented by the external current @xmath3 , and then the generated quantum state of the flux qubit c is transferred into the nve . in particular , a small quantum state rotation for the nve , @xmath127 will occur when single quantum rotation @xmath128 is applied on the flux qubit c. as shown in eq.([eq13 ] ) , the rabi frequency @xmath129 decreases , when increaseing the distance @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , the influence of single - qubit - rotations on the memory unit could be effectively suppressed by separating the quantum memory and computing units because @xmath130 when @xmath131 . a more detailed study on this",
    "will be presented in section v by numerically simulating the quantum - storage - fidelity using typical actual experimental parameters .    before ending this subsection",
    ", we would like to point out another advantage of our proposal . here , the coupling between two flux qubits can be easily controlled by an external dc magnetic field .",
    "thus , we can cutoff ( or turn on ) the connection between the quantum computing and memory units by a dc magnetic field when quantum gate operations ( or quantum information transfer ) are implemented .",
    "this property ensures that the reversible quantum storage process can be easily realized in our proposal without needing any additional operations applied on either the computing or memory units .",

    "we show that the flux qubit c and nve will exchange energy by virtually exciting the qubit m , which could effectively avoid the losses induced by qubit m. so , in the dispersive interaction case , the goal of quantum storage , that is , @xmath139 can also be realized perfectly at the appropriate time @xmath140 , for the ideal parameter conditions : @xmath141 and @xmath94 .    in order to show the validity of the above discussion",

    ", we also present the influences of the system parameters on the quantum - storage - fidelity in the dispersive - interaction case .",
    "figure[fig6](a ) shows that the frequencies of the computing and memory qubits still need to be close , i.e. , @xmath142 , in order to obtain high fidelity .",
    "it can also be seen from fig.[fig6](b ) that the fidelity of the quantum storage is robust with respect to the system parameter @xmath106 for large detuning .",
    "notice that the interference fringe in fig.[fig6 ] comes from the detuning - induced frequency - shift on the computing and memory qubits when we adiabatically eliminate the degrees of the flux qubit m.",

    "figures 7(a , b ) and ( c , d ) correspond to the case of resonant and dispersive interactions , respectively .",
    "it is clearly shown from figs.[fig7](a ) and ( c ) that the influence of the quantum computing process on the quantum memory can be effectively suppressed by separating the computing and memory units . in addition , we also clearly show in figs.[fig7](b ) and ( d ) the dependence of the quantum - storage - fidelity on the distance @xmath5 , and thus , a high - fidelity quantum storage process can be achieved in our proposal by choosing a proper distance ( @xmath145@xmath146 m ) between two flux qubits .",
    "the present numerical results are consistent with the qualitative conclusion obtained in section iii , and clearly show the feasibility of our proposal when using experimental parameters .",
    "we list the following experimental conditions required by our proposal : ( i ) the flux qubits m and c should be connected with a tunable coupling strength , and have a long coherence time of the order of a microsecond ; ( ii ) the density of the nve should be high enough to realize the required coupling strength between the nve and the flux qubit m ; ( iii ) in order to implement a quantum memory with high fidelity , the quantum computing ( flux qubit c ) and memory ( nve ) units should be separated by an appropriate distance .",
    "first , it is possible to couple two flux qubits with a tunable coupling strength @xmath2 by using a squid or ancilla flux qubit .",
    "experimentally , there are several methods for realizing this tunable coupling .",

    "here the value of @xmath16 is much larger than the decay rate of the flux qubit ( @xmath149 1 mhz ) . with technical advances ,",
    "the increasing number of the nv centers in each ensemble ( or the larger size of the flux qubit ) will further enhance the coupling strength . in our proposal",
    ", we consider a flux qubit m with size @xmath150 @xmath146 m and a density of nv centers @xmath151 @xmath152 @xcite .",

    "in addition , the dephasing and decay times of the flux qubits made so far are usually order of 1 to @xmath155s .",
    "the nv center sample has relatively long decay and dephasing times @xmath156 1 ms and @xmath157 ms .",
    "therefore , in our proposal , the quantum - storage - operation time @xmath154s is much shorter than the coherence times of flux qubits and nv centers .",
    "however , it should also be noticed that the decoherence of the nve increases when the density of the nv centers increases .",
    "thus , in order to obtain a high - storage - fidelity , it is still required to suppress the decoherence of the nve .",
    "this decoherence is normally induced by the dipole interaction between the redundant nitrogen spins and the nv centers , which is due to the low nitrogen - to - nv conversion rate .",
    "fortunately , this problem could be overcome by applying an external driving field to the electron spins on the redundant nitrogen atoms , which leads to an increased coherence time of the nve if the nitrogen spins are flipped by the spin - echo pulses on a time scale much faster than the flip - flop processes @xcite .",

    "it is shown there that the quantum - storage - fidelities @xmath98 are robust regarding decoherence of the hybrid system .",
    "high - fidelity quantum storage can still be realized even when the decay rate @xmath162 mhz ( 200 khz ) in the case of resonant ( dispersive ) interaction .",
    "finally , as shown in our numerical calculations ( fig.[fig7 ] ) , it is necessary to separate the quantum computing ( flux qubit ) and memory ( nve ) units with an appropriate distance ( @xmath163 @xmath164 m ) , in order to obtain high quantum - storage - fidelity .",
    "according to related experiments on coupled - flux qubits @xcite , the above condition is feasible with current technology . for our case",
    ", we can choose an ancilla flux qubit with a length of 5 @xmath146 m to connect the flux qubits m and c. together with the sizes of the flux qubits m and c , the condition @xmath145 @xmath146 m can be satisfied .",

    "we have shown that this proposal can provide high - fidelity quantum storage under realistic conditions , both in the resonant and the dispersive - interaction cases .",
    "we argue that our proposal can effectively eliminate the mutual influence between the quantum computing and quantum storage processes by separating the computing and memory units .",
    "thus , high - fidelity quantum storage can be realized in our proposal without needing any additional control pulses on the computing or memory units .",

    "<S> we propose how to realize high - fidelity quantum storage using a hybrid quantum architecture including two coupled flux qubits and a nitrogen - vacancy center ensemble ( nve ) . </S>",
    "<S> one of the flux qubits is considered as the quantum computing processor and the nve serves as the quantum memory . by separating the computing and memory units , </S>",
    "<S> the influence of the quantum computing process on the quantum memory can be effectively eliminated , and hence the quantum storage of an arbitrary quantum state of the computing qubit could be achieved with high fidelity . furthermore the present proposal is robust with respect to fluctuations of the system parameters , and it is experimentally feasibile with currently available technology . </S>"
