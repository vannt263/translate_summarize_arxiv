    "<S> we implement a double - pixel , compressive sensing camera to efficiently characterize , at high resolution , the spatially entangled fields produced by spontaneous parametric downconversion . </S>",
    "<S> this technique leverages sparsity in spatial correlations between entangled photons to improve acquisition times over raster - scanning by a scaling factor up to @xmath0 for @xmath1-dimensional images . </S>",
    "<S> we image at resolutions up to @xmath2 dimensions per detector and demonstrate a channel capacity of @xmath3 bits per photon . by comparing the entangled photons classical mutual information in conjugate bases , we violate an entropic einstein - podolsky - rosen separability criterion for all measured resolutions . more broadly , our result indicates compressive sensing can be especially effective for higher - order measurements on correlated systems . </S>"
