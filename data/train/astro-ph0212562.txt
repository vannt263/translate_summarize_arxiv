    "the galaxy luminosity function ( hereafter lf ) , which describes the number of galaxies per unit volume as a function of luminosity , is a fundamental tool for testing theories of galaxy formation and interpreting observations of galaxies at high redshift for evidence of evolution .",
    "furthermore , precise and accurate measurements of the lf in different environments have the potential to provide important clues as to the role of ` environmental ' processes ( e.g. , dynamical interactions in rich clusters ) in determining the properties of the present - day galaxy population .",
    "one of the main legacies of the numerous redshift surveys that have been undertaken in the last decade or more is the wealth of lf measurements for galaxies in the low density ` field ' environment .",
    "a compilation and comparison of these various measurements was recently published by @xcite .",
    "this work showed that while the data were adequately represented by a schechter function , there were serious discrepancies between the various measurements , with the lfs differing by as much as a factor of 2 at the @xmath7 point , and with a scatter of a factor of 10 at @xmath8 .",
    "these differences are due to a combination of surface brightness selection , colour , aperture effects and local density variations among others .",
    "these problems have now been overcome in the recent analysis of large redshift surveys such as the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs : folkes et al .",
    "1999 , madgwick et al .",
    "2001 , norberg et al . 2002 ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss : blanton et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "rich clusters of galaxies provide the other extreme in environment , representing the highest density regions inhabited by galaxies .",
    "it is generally easier to derive lfs in clusters , since they provide rich ensembles of galaxies all at the same distance , whose over - density with respect to the surrounding field is sufficiently high to efficiently identify members either photometrically , through the statistical removal of foreground and background galaxies ( e.g. , driver et al .",
    "1998a and references therein ) or spectroscopically @xcite    these techniques have been used to measure lfs for individual clusters , which in many cases have been combined to form a ` composite ' lf to improve statistics ( particularly at the brightest luminosities ) and average out systematic uncertainties @xcite . however , these studies have not been unanimous on the exact form of the lf , with some claiming there to be significant differences between the lfs from cluster to cluster and between cluster and field @xcite , while others finding no differences and concluding that galaxies in all environments appear to be drawn from a single , ` universal ' lf @xcite .",
    "a summary of the schechter function fits from some of these previous studies ( all of which are based on the technique of background subtraction , unlike the present work which uses spectroscopic identifications of cluster members ) is given in table 1 .",
    "we have transformed magnitudes to @xmath9 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 but we have not changed their cosmology .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the error ellipses for the schechter function fits to all these lfs are compared in fig .",
    "we only show the 3@xmath10 contour for field galaxies as the errors are small .",
    "error ellipse for the field data .",
    ", width=317 ]    the @xmath11 comparison shows that the overall cluster and field lfs differ at more than 3@xmath10 , and this conclusion is also borne out by a comparison of the error contours presented in fig .  5 .",
    "in terms of the individual lf parameters , the overall cluster lf is 0.3 magnitudes brighter in @xmath12 and 0.1 steeper in @xmath13 than the overall field lf .",
    "we note here that although the ` field ' lf is actually the total lf for all environments , clusters do not contribute to the field sample to any great extent , as cluster members are only 3% of the total number of galaxies in the survey ; even for bright galaxies this fraction is less than 6% .",
    "significant differences are also found when the field and cluster lfs for the different spectral classes are compared .",
    "for ease of comparison , fig .",
    "6 shows type - dependent lfs for both field and cluster galaxies ; the the field lfs are normalized so that the overall field lf matches the overall cluster lf at @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath11 tests show that the lfs for type 1 cluster and field galaxies are different over their entire range .",
    "this is due to the fact that the type 1 lf in clusters is both brighter and much steeper than in the field .",
    "the lfs of type 2 galaxies also differ , but fig .",
    "6 both shows that the difference is primarily due to the steeper faint - end slope ; the @xmath11 fit shows that , to @xmath15 , the two lfs match adequately .",
    "finally , the lf of star - forming galaxies ( types 3 and 4 ) are essentially identical in clusters and the field .",
    "these differences in the shapes of the types - specific lfs , and the different contributions from each type ( as shown in fig .  1 ) ,",
    "account for the differences between the overall cluster and field lfs .",
    "the steeper faint - end slopes for type 1 and type 2 galaxies in clusters may lead , at magnitudes fainter than those covered by our sample , to an upturn of the effective lf slope , such as has been claimed to exist in some clusters @xcite .",
    "one caveat concerns the assumption implicit in equation  9 , that the galaxies without spectral types have the same type distribution as those for which types could be determined . in order to test the importance of this issue , we have computed lfs for each of the spectral types without any completeness correction .",
    "we find that @xmath12 is hardly changed whereas @xmath13 is flattened by about 0.1 ; nevertheless , the lfs of type 1 and 2 galaxies remain steeper than in the field whereas types 3 + 4 are consistent with the field lf .",
    "incompleteness in spectral type comes from two sources : galaxies which were not observed and therefore have neither redshift nor spectral type and which are therefore an unbiased sample , and galaxies whose spectra have too low a signal - to - noise to yield a redshift or a spectral type .",
    "the untyped galaxies are roughly divided evenly between these two categories .",
    "it is only the latter one that may suffer from bias , in that galaxies of a specific type may be preferentially misidentified .",
    "we have therefore adopted a ` maximal correction ' where all of these galaxies are assigned to each type in turn .",
    "this effect is small for types 1 and 2 but may be significant for types 3 and 4 .",
    "this is shown in fig",
    "however , no matter what correction is applied , cluster galaxies of all types have lfs with faint - end slopes as steep or steeper than their counterparts in the field .",
    "these differences between the type - dependent lfs in the cluster and field samples appear to be inconsistent with previous claims for a universal type - dependent lf @xcite .",
    "however , it needs to be noted that these earlier studies are concerned with morphological types , which are only moderately well correlated with our spectral types ( fig .  1 )",
    ", so that a given spectral type may include a range of morphological types .",
    "it is instructive at this stage to compare lf parameters for field and cluster galaxies , divided by spectral type .",
    "7 shows that , progressing from late to early types , the cluster lfs have brighter @xmath12 and flatter @xmath13 , as observed in the field lfs @xcite . the trend in the value of @xmath12 with type",
    "is stronger in clusters than in the field , with a similar value of @xmath12 for type 3 + 4 galaxies but a significantly brighter @xmath12 for type 1 galaxies .",
    "however the trend of @xmath13 with type is weaker for cluster galaxies than for field galaxies  at faint magnitudes the type 3 + 4 lf is steeply rising ( @xmath16 ) in both clusters and the field , but the type 1 lf in the field is actually falling at faint magnitudes ( @xmath17 ) while in clusters it is merely flat ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "this trend of @xmath13 with environment for type 1 galaxies is apparent even within the cluster sample : the type 1 galaxies in richer clusters have a lf with a steeper faint end than those in poorer clusters , which in turn have a steeper lf than type 1 galaxes in the field ( see table  3 and fig .  7 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the trend for star formation rate to be broadly anticorrelated with the faint - end slope , which has been observed by @xcite for galaxies in groups identified within the 2dfgrs 100k release .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite claim similar variations in their samples .",
    "we have also compared subsamples of clusters chosen according to velocity dispersion , richness , bautz - morgan type and likelihood of containing substructure : similarly , we also considered samples of galaxies within and outside two king core radii from the cluster centre .",
    "these results are summarized in table  3 .",
    "we find that the values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 for each pair considered ( e.g.  low and high velocity dispersion ) do not differ at more than 1.5@xmath10 in all cases .",
    "the only possible exception is for the case of clusters containing substructure , where @xmath13 appears to be steeper . in all cases ( again , excepting clusters with likely substructure ) the derived lf parameters are consistent with those of the total lf within about 1.5@xmath10 .",
    "this is in contrast with @xcite , who provided weak evidence for differences in the lfs of clusters with high and low @xmath10 , and with @xcite , who suggested differences between rich and poor clusters .",
    "the difference in the lf of clusters with substructure is potentially interesting , as it is generally believed that substructure is an indicator of recent or ongoing cluster merging .",
    "however an examination of the confidence contours for the fitted schechter function parameters , shown in fig .",
    "4 , shows that when the correlated nature of the parameters is considered , the fits to the lfs of the clusters with and without substructure are in fact consistent at better than 2@xmath10 .",
    "the similarity of the lfs for the various subsamples is confirmed by two - sample @xmath11 tests , which indicate that the probabilities that the pairs of contrasted subsamples have consistent lfs are : 99.3% for early and late bautz - morgan clusters , 35.6% for high and low @xmath10 clusters , 50.0% for rich and poor clusters , 27.1% for clusters with and without substructure and 0.9% for galaxies within and outside of 300 kpc from the cluster centre .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "4 shows that the lfs of galaxies in the inner 300 kpc and the outer regions of clusters differ in detail ; in particular , the inner region lf is a poor fit to the schechter function , with a deficit of @xmath19 galaxies and an excess of brighter objects .",
    "this is reminiscent of the galactic cannibalism scenario of @xcite and @xcite , where @xmath19 galaxies are preferentially destroyed to fuel the growth of giant ellipticals , d and cd galaxies .",
    "an alternate approach to quantifying the differences between lfs is to calculate the dwarf to giant ratio ( d / g ) .",
    "we define giants as galaxies with @xmath20 and dwarfs as galaxies with @xmath21 , as in @xcite .",
    "these ratios are tabulated in table  3 for all the lfs we consider . in general , our cluster samples have d / g ratios comparable with those of moderately rich systems in @xcite . the d / g ratios for the contrasting pairs of subsamples only differ at the @xmath221@xmath10 level , except for clusters with and without substructure ( 1.5@xmath10 ) and the inner and outer regions of clusters ( 2.2@xmath10)in no case is the difference in d / g ratio highly significant .",
    "the overall impression is therefore one of broad universality of the lf over a range of cluster properties .",
    "this is surprising if one considers the very considerable differences between the lfs of the various spectral types in the field @xcite , since different mixtures of types would lead to different lfs .",
    "for instance , the morphology - density relation might lead one to expect that rich and massive clusters would be more elliptical - rich than poor , low - mass clusters ; likewise , early b - m clusters should be dominated by ellipticals , while late b - m type clusters should be spiral - rich . mixing the field lfs of the different morphological mixes in these differing proportions would lead to clusters with significantly different lfs .",
    "the reason this does not appear to be the case is that the lfs of the different types are more similar in clusters than they are in the field , so that changing the mixture of types within clusters has less effect than one might have expected .",
    "the main conclusions of our analysis are as follows :    \\(i ) we have determined the composite lf of galaxies in clusters from the 2dfgrs .",
    "the lf is well - fitted by a schechter function with parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "this is significantly different to the field lf of @xcite , having a characteristic magnitude that is approximately 0.3  mag brighter and a faint - end power - law slope that is approximately 0.1 steeper .",
    "\\(ii ) there is no significant evidence for variations in the lf across a broad range of cluster properties ; the lf appears similar for clusters with high and low velocity dispersions , for rich and poor clusters , for clusters with early and late bautz - morgan types , and for clusters with and without substructure .",
    "however the core regions of clusters differ from the outer parts in having an excess of very bright galaxies .",
    "\\(iii ) breaking down the lf by spectral type , the same trends are apparent in clusters as in the field : the lfs of earlier - type galaxies , with lower star - formation rates , have brighter characteristic magnitudes and shallower faint - end slopes ; the lfs of later - type galaxies , with higher star - formation rates , have fainter characteristic magnitudes and steeper faint - end slopes .",
    "the trend in faint - end slope , which is the dominant difference between the lfs of the various spectral types in the field , is much less pronounced in clusters .",
    "the smaller differences between the lfs of different spectral types in clusters explain why variations in cluster properties giving rise to significant variations in the mixture of types do not lead to significant differences in the cluster lfs .",
    "\\(iv ) a comparison between the field and cluster lfs of each spectral type reveals that while the lf of late - type , star - forming galaxies is very similar in clusters and the field , the lf of early - type galaxies with low star - formation rates is both brighter and steeper in clusters than in the field ; intermediate types in clusters have an lf with a similar bright end but a steeper faint end than their field counterparts . as",
    "early and intermediate spectral types are predominant in clusters , the overall cluster lf is also brighter and steeper than the overall field lf .",
    "the above results may be compared with two recent redshift - based studies of galaxy clusters .",
    "@xcite derived the @xmath25-band lf of galaxies in the inner 25  arcmin of the coma cluster from a 100%-complete sample of members , and found that the cluster s lf is indistinguishable from the general field lf .",
    "@xcite use a redshift survey of 6 clusters ( with a redshift completeness of 2050% ) to derive @xmath26-band lfs for both the cluster members and the field galaxies in the fore- and background of the clusters .",
    "they also find that the @xmath26-band field and cluster lfs are very similar .",
    "these results are for samples selected in red and infrared passbands , and are therefore less sensitive to star formation , to which our @xmath27-selected sample is more closely correlated .",
    "in contrast to these results , we find that there _ are _ small but statistically significant differences between field and cluster galaxies , with the blue - selected cluster lf being both brighter and steeper than that in the field .",
    "the similarity between the field and cluster lfs in the red and near - infrared passbands suggests that field and cluster galaxies with the same total stellar mass have similar integrated star - formation histories , while the difference between the field and cluster lfs in the blue simply means that the star - formation rate is significantly affected by the cluster environment .    up until now it has been possible to claim that the observed differences between cluster and field lfs were due in large part simply to the different proportions in which supposedly universal type - specific lfs were mixed in the two environments .",
    "this explanation is now precluded by the finding that the type - specific lfs differ significantly with environment ( in fact , as fig .",
    "5 shows , the difference between clusters and the field is less for the overall lf than for some of the type - specific lfs ) .",
    "another way to understand the differences between the field and cluster lfs is to consider a simple ` closed box ' model . in this model",
    "one considers the type - specific field lfs to be the initial lfs within the volumes which today have collapsed to form the clusters .",
    "the relative normalizations of the lfs are based on the observed relative numbers of the different types in the field and in clusters ( types 1:2:3 + 4 in the proportions 0.36:0.32:032 in the field and 0.54:0.24:0.22 in clusters ; see fig .  1 ) and the assumption that the total number of objects in the initial and final lfs is the same ( i.e.  neglecting mergers within the closed - box volume ) .",
    "evolution from the initial ( field ) lfs to the final ( cluster ) lfs occurs almost entirely through processes which suppress star - formation as the cluster collapses and becomes denser @xcite , converting galaxies from later types to earlier types . in the simplest version of this model",
    ", this suppression of star - formation does not affect the galaxies luminosities .",
    "8 shows the initial ( field ) and final ( cluster ) lfs of each spectral type in this naive model , and compares these lfs to the observed cluster lfs .",
    "this model has some successes : it is consistent with the fact that the type 3 + 4 cluster lf has the same shape but a lower normalization than the field lf , and it does cause the initial field lfs of the type 1 and 2 galaxies to evolve towards the forms they are observed to have in clusters .",
    "however this passive steepening of the lfs , achieved by shifting galaxies from the steeper lfs of later types to the shallower lfs of earlier types , fails to steepen the lfs sufficiently to reproduce the observed clusters .",
    "a more successful model requires both passive steepening as galaxies shift from later to earlier types and also active steepening due to luminosity - dependent fading .",
    "in such a model , the suppression of star - formation affects about a third of type 3 + 4 galaxies , independent of luminosity .",
    "the affected galaxies instantaneous star - formation rate decreases , lowering the strength of their @xmath28 emission so that they become type 2 galaxies .",
    "this leaves the shape of the type 3 + 4 lf the same , but reduces the numbers of these strongly star - forming galaxies .",
    "when type 2 galaxies undergo further suppression of their star - formation rate , this has the effect of decreasing their @xmath27 luminosities and eventually converting them to type 1 , where further fading may occur .",
    "this fading must be greater for brighter galaxies in order to actively steepen the lf slopes and reproduce the observed cluster lfs .",
    "in addition , some merging ( or cannibalism ) is required to explain the small number of very bright type 1 galaxies in clusters which are not present in the field lfs , and may also help explain the deficit of bright type 2 and @xmath19 type 1 cluster galaxies .",
    "this is consistent with the conclusions of @xcite , who find that the only difference between the @xmath26-band lfs of cluster and field galaxies is an excess of bright non - starforming galaxies .",
    "however the higher dwarf - to - giant ratio in the lfs of earlier - type galaxies in clusters indicates that star - formation suppression is more important than mergers in shaping the cluster lf .",
    "it should be noted that the field lf is in fact the mean lf of the entire galaxy population , and is therefore dominated by galaxies belonging to groups .",
    "thus our results therefore imply that suppression of star - formation is the dominant effect in evolving from the typical group environment to the rich cluster environment .",
    "merger effects are expected to be more important in groups , however , and this will be investigated in a future paper based on the group catalogue derived directly from the 2dfgrs .",
    "the closed - box model is over - simplified in a variety of ways , and can only serve as a qualitative guide to understanding the processes shaping the lf of cluster galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , a quantitative interpretation of our results is hampered by the fact that few theoretical studies have considered the evolution of the lf and its dependence on environment , and most have been limited to the brighter cluster members ( e.g.  malumuth & richstone 1984 ) .",
    "detailed semi - analytic models are clearly required to explore the relative importance of the various mechanisms that may be driving the evolution of galaxies in clusters .",
    "these models will need to be complemented by more stringent observational constraints to distinguish the effects of the different processes involved .",
    "it will be particularly important to obtain the near - uv and near - ir lfs for large spectroscopic samples of cluster galaxies .",
    "these will yield both the instantaneous star - formation rate and the total stellar mass of the galaxies , and reveal where galaxies are evolving due to mergers and where they are undergoing changes in their star - formation rate .",
