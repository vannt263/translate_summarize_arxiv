    "supersymmetry is at present one of the most favored ideas for physics beyond the standard model  ( sm )  @xcite .",
    "a particularly attractive implementation of the idea of supersymmetry is the minimal supersymmetric standard model  ( mssm ) obtained by introducing the supersymmetric partners of the of the sm states , and introducing an additional higgs doublet , with opposite hypercharge to that of the sm higgs doublet , in order to cancel the gauge anomalies and generate masses for all the fermions of the standard model  @xcite .",
    "supersymmetry must obviously be a broken symmetry . in order for broken supersymmetry to be effective in protecting the weak scale against large radiative corrections ,",
    "the supersymmetric partners of the sm particles should have masses of the order of a few hundred gev .",
    "their discovery is one of the main goals of present and future accelerators . in particular , a @xmath4 linear collider with a high luminosity @xmath5 fb@xmath6 , and a center - of - mass energy of @xmath7 gev in the first stage ,",
    "will be an important tool in determining the parameters of the low energy supersymmetric model with a high precision  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , polarization of the electron ( and positron ) beam can enhance the capability of such a linear collider  @xcite in unravelling the structure of the underlying supersymmetric model .    in the minimal supersymmetric standard model",
    "the fermionic partners of the two higgs doublets  ( @xmath8 ) mix with the fermionic partners of the gauge bosons to produce four neutralino states @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and two chargino states @xmath11 , @xmath12 in the mssm the lightest neutralino is favored to be the lightest supersymmetric particle , and assuming , @xmath13-parity  ( @xmath14 ) conservation , is absolutely stable . the neutralino states of the minimal supersymmetric standard model with @xmath14 conservation have been studied in great detail , because the lightest neutralino , being the lightest supersymmetric particle  ( lsp ) , is the end product of any process involving supersymmetric particle in the final state .    there are alternatives to the mssm , an elegant one being the model with an additional chiral electroweak gauge singlet higgs superfield @xmath15 which couples to the two higgs doublet superfields @xmath16 and @xmath17 via a dimensionless trilinear term @xmath18 in the superpotential .",
    "this model can solve the the @xmath19 problem of the mssm in a natural manner . when the scalar component of the singlet superfield @xmath15 obtains a vacuum expectation value , a bilinear term @xmath20 involving the two higgs doublets is naturally generated .",
    "furthermore , when this scalar component of the chiral singlet superfield @xmath15 acquires a vacuum expectation value of the order of the @xmath21 breaking scale , it gives rise to an effective value of @xmath19  ( @xmath22 ) of the order of the electroweak scale .",
    "however , the inclusion of the singlet superfield leads to additional trilinear superpotential coupling @xmath23 in the model , the so called nonminimal , or next - to - minimal  @xcite , supersymmetric standard model  ( nmssm ) .",
    "the absence of @xmath24 term , and the absence of tadpole and mass couplings , @xmath15 and @xmath25 in the nmssm is made natural by postulating a suitable discrete symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the nmssm is attractive on account of the simple resolution it offers to the @xmath19 problem , and of the scale invariance of its classical action in the supersymmetric limit  @xcite . since no dimensional supersymmetric parameters are present in the superpotential of nmssm , it is the simplest supersymmetric extension of the standard model in which the electroweak scale originates from the supersymmetry breaking scale only .",
    "its enlarged higgs sector may help in relaxing the fine - tuning and little hierarchy problems of the mssm , thereby opening new perspectives for the higgs boson searches at high energy colliders  @xcite , and for dark matter searches  @xcite .",
    "in the nonminimal supersymmetric standard model the mixing of fermionic partners of higgs and gauge bosons  @xcite produces five neutralino states @xmath9 , @xmath26 , and two chargino states @xmath11 , @xmath12 furthermore , because of the presence of the fermionic partner of the singlet higgs boson , the neutralino states can have an admixture of this @xmath21 singlet fermion , thereby affecting the phenomenology of the neutralinos in the nonminimal supersymmetric standard model .",
    "the lightest neutralino state  ( @xmath27 ) of mssm or nmssm , being typically the lsp , is stable and therefore , a possible dark matter candidate  @xcite .",
    "since the neutralinos are among the lightest particles in low energy supersymmetric models , they are expected to be the first states to be produced at the colliding beam experiments . at an electron - positron collider , such as the international linear collider  ( ilc )",
    ", the lightest neutralino can be produced in pairs @xmath28 this process proceeds via @xmath29 boson and selectron exchange  @xcite . in collider experiments the lightest neutralino escapes detection .",
    "in such a situation the production of the lightest neutralino pair ( [ pairneuts ] ) is invisible .",
    "therefore , we must look for the signature of neutralinos in the radiative process @xmath30 despite this process being suppressed by the square of the electromagnetic coupling , it might be the first process where the lightest supersymmetric states could be observed at the @xmath31 colliders .",
    "the signal of the radiative process ( [ radiative ] ) is a single high energy photon with the missing energy carried away by the neutralinos .",
    "the process  ( [ radiative ] ) has been studied in detail in the minimal supersymmetric standard model  @xcite .",
    "some of these studies underline the importance of longitudinal  @xcite , and even transverse beam polarizations .",
    "on the other hand , the signature `` photon plus missing energy , '' that arises in the process ( [ radiative ] ) has been studied in detail by different lep collaborations  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the radiative neutrino process @xmath2 in the sm is the leading process with this signature , for which the cross section depends on the number @xmath32 of light neutrino species  @xcite .",
    "the lep collaborations have found no deviations from the sm prediction , and , therefore , only bounds on the masses of supersymmetric particles have been set  @xcite . for a review of the experimental situation , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "most of the theoretical studies on radiative neutralino production in the literature have been carried out in the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard model .",
    "this includes calculations relevant to ilc with a high center - of - mass energy , high luminosity and longitudinally polarized beams , as well as study of the sm background from the radiative neutrino production @xmath33 and the supersymmetric background from radiative sneutrino production @xmath34 the discovery potential of ilc may be significantly enhanced  @xcite if both beams are polarized , particularly if other susy states like heavier neutralino , chargino or even slepton pairs are too heavy to be produced at the first stage of the ilc at @xmath7  gev .    in a previous paper",
    "( referred to as paper i ) we have carried out a detailed study of the radiative process  ( [ radiative ] ) in the nonminimal supersymmetric model and compared the predictions with those of the minimal supersymmetric standard model  @xcite .",
    "this study was carried out for unpolarized electron and positron beams . in this paper",
    "we continue this study and consider the radiative process  ( [ radiative ] ) in the nonminimal supersymmetric standard model with polarized electron and positron beams to understand in detail if the signal can be enhanced by the use of polarized beams .",
    "furthermore , the sm background photons from radiative neutrino production process  ( [ radiativenu ] ) with beam polarizations will have to be taken into account for a proper analysis of the radiative neutralino production process  ( [ radiative ] ) .",
    "beam polarizations could enhance the signal photons for the process  ( [ radiative ] ) for nmssm and reduce those from the sm background at the same time , which could lead to the enhancement of the statistics .",
    "we will also consider supersymmetric background photons from radiative sneutrino production process  ( [ radiativesnu ] ) with polarized beams .",
    "this is important if sneutrino production is kinematically accessible and if the sneutrino decay is invisible",
    ". we will compare and contrast the results obtained for nmssm with those for the minimal supersymmetric standard model with polarized beams .",
    "this will include the signal for the radiative neutralino process , and the dependence of the cross sections on the parameters of the neutralino sector .",
    "this comparison will allow us to assess the feasibility of observing the radiative neutralino process for the most popular low energy supersymmetric models at a @xmath31 collider .",

    "this is done by using various theoretical and experimental constraints on the parameter space of nmssm . in particular , we constrain the values of the trilinear superpotential parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 which enter the neutralino mass matrix of the nmssm .",
    "we also describe the phase space for the signal process as well as the cuts on outgoing photon angle and energy that we use to regularize the infrared and collinear divergences in the tree level cross section .",
