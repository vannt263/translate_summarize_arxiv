    "this paper is organized as follows . in the first section",
    "we discuss bilinear restriction estimates , and show how one can pass back and forth between these estimates and the standard restriction estimates .",
    "we also generalize the @xmath5 bilinear restriction estimate of @xcite to higher dimensions .    in the second section",
    "we give analogues of the above results for the kakeya operator .",
    "in particular we give a bilinear improvement to wolff s kakeya theorem in arbitrary dimension .    in the third section",
    "we give applications of these bilinear estimates in three dimensions .",
    "for example , we are able to improve the @xmath6 exponent in wolff s restriction theorem to @xmath7 .",
    "we are also able to prove a sharp @xmath3 restriction theorem which improves on the classical @xmath8 tomas - stein theorem , and also give some concrete progress on a bilinear restriction conjecture of klainerman and machedon .",
    "we also give a non - bilinear approach to these estimates , which gives weaker results but is more direct and probably has a wider range of application .",
