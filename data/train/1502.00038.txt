    "a function of a biological motor might result in the generation of large pulling force .",
    "for example , active force from myosin generates substantial mechanical stress on structures of the sarcomere @xcite .",
    "mechanical forces can also be generated within the biological system .",
    "for example , leukocytes that patrol the blood flow in search of pathogens , need to generate internal force to squeeze into in and pass through connective tissues @xcite .",
    "in addition to biochemical stimuli , cellular processes involving the cytoskeleton can be modulated in response to external force @xcite .",
    "structural arrangements of proteins have evolved in response to the selection pressure from biological forces .",
    "the three - dimensional structures often exhibit a modular architecture composed of discrete structural regions .",
    "these include semi - static structures such as actin filaments and microtubules , and flexible structures such as muscle protein titin and fibrin clot @xcite .",
    "titin , a giant @xmath3 protein formed by linked immunoglobulin and fibronectin domains defines the structure and elasticity of muscle sarcomere @xcite .",
    "proteins that form or interact with the extracellular matrix ( ecm ) have modular or multidomain architecture @xcite .",
    "these include fibronectin fibrils , which form meshworks around the cell , and integrins , which link the cell external and intracellular environment @xcite .",
    "fibrin polymerization in blood results in formation of branched network called a fibrin clot , which must sustain large shear stress due to blood flow @xcite .",
    "protein shells of plant and animal viruses ( capsids ) are often made of multiple copies of a single structural unit ( capsomer ) .",
    "for example , the capsid of cowpea chlorotic mottle virus is an icosahedral shell comprised of @xmath4 copies of a single ( @xmath5 amino acid ) protein @xcite .",
    "physical properties of proteins have adapted to biological forces . in ecm assembly , fibronectin subunits change conformations from compact to extended .",
    "the extent of assembly is controlled by cell contractility through actin filaments @xcite .",
    "hence , tissue tension regulate matrix assembly .",
    "virus capsids should be stable enough to protect encapsulated material ( dna or rna ) , yet , unstable to release the material when invading their host cells @xcite .",

    "cell adhesion and migration rely on reversible changes in mechanical properties of cells .",
    "spatial distribution of internal tension in cell remodeling , derived from dynamic regulation of contractile actin - myosin networks , correlates cell shape and movement @xcite .",

    "for example , tissue deformation during mechanical stimulation alters the conformation of ecm molecules .",
    "filamins involved in mechanotransduction alter their structure in response to external tension @xcite .",
    "proper communication between structural regions in multidomain proteins is important for regulation .",

    "single - molecule experimental techniques such as atomic force microscopy ( afm ) @xcite and optical trap @xcite , have made it possible to study life processes at the level of individual molecules .",
    "these experiments , which utilize mechanical force to unfold proteins or to dissociate protein - protein complexes , have made it possible to probe the unfolding or unbinding transitions one at a time @xcite . in",
    "the context of protein forced unfolding , grabbing the molecule at specific positions allows one to select specific region(s ) of the molecule and to define the unfolding reaction coordinate .",
    "mechanical manipulation continues to provide a unique approach to quantify the unfolding transitions in terms of the measurable quantities - the unfolding forces ( constant velocity or force - ramp experiment ) and the unfolding times ( constant force or force - clamp experiment ) .",
    "consider a force - clamp experiment on a multimeric protein @xmath6 formed by head - to - tail connected identical domains ( @xmath7 s ) . the protein is subjected to the external pulling force , and each unfolding transition causes an increase in the chain length , @xmath8 . as a result , the total length of the polypeptide chain @xmath9 shows the characteristic pattern of stepwise increases ( @xmath8 s ) , which mark sequential unfolding transitions in protein domains .    the goal of statistical analysis and modeling of force spectroscopy data is to obtain accurate information about the physical characteristics of protein domains . yet ,",
    "due to inherent limitations in the current experimental resolution , there is no direct way of attributing the times of transitions to the protein domains or structural regions where these transitions have occurred .",
    "we only have partial or incomplete observation of the system .",
    "said differently , it is not possible to determine which specific domain has unfolded at any time since any domain can unfold at any given time .",

    "there are two possible scenarios of unfolding . in the first pathway ,",
    "the first domain ( @xmath10 ) unfolds first and the second domain ( @xmath11 ) unfolds second . in the second pathway , the order of unfolding is reversed . in an experimental measurement , what is being recorded is the first unfolding time ( @xmath12 ) and the second unfolding time ( @xmath13 ) in a sequence of two observations , and it is impossible to tell which domain has unfolded first or second .",
    "hence , the first unfolding times ( @xmath12 ) and the second unfolding times ( @xmath13 ) involve contributions from the first domain @xmath10 , which unfolds at time @xmath14 , and the second domain @xmath11 , which unfolds at time @xmath15 .",
    "can we obtain domain - specific information from the experimental data ?",
    "the first step is to understand the nature of the random variables measured . in a constant force experiment on an @xmath16-domain protein ( @xmath17@xmath1@xmath18@xmath1@xmath19@xmath6 ) ,",
    "individual domains unfold one after another but any domain can unfold at any given time .",
    "the observed unfolding times are ordered , i.e. they comprise a set of ordered time variates , also known as order statistics @xcite .",

    "<S> cooperativity is a hallmark of proteins , many of which show a modular architecture comprising discrete structural domains . detecting and describing dynamic couplings between structural regions is difficult in view of the many - body nature of protein - protein interactions . by utilizing the gpu - based computational acceleration </S>",
    "<S> , we carried out simulations of the protein forced unfolding for the dimer @xmath0@xmath1@xmath0 of the all-@xmath2-sheet @xmath0 domains used as a model multidomain protein . </S>",
    "<S> we found that while the physically non - interacting identical protein domains ( @xmath0 ) show nearly symmetric mechanical properties at low tension , reflected , e.g. , in the similarity of their distributions of unfolding times , these properties become distinctly different when tension is increased . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the uncorrelated unfolding transitions at a low pulling force become increasingly more correlated ( dependent ) at higher forces . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the applied force not only breaks `` the mechanical symmetry '' but also couples the physically non - interacting protein domains forming a multi - domain protein . </S>",
    "<S> we call this effect `` the topological coupling '' </S>",
    "<S> . we developed a new theory , inspired by order statistics , to characterize protein - protein interactions in multi - domain proteins . </S>",
    "<S> the method utilizes the squared - gaussian model , but it can also be used in conjunction with other parametric models for the distribution of unfolding times . </S>",
    "<S> the formalism can be taken to the single - molecule experimental lab to probe mechanical cooperativity and domain communication in multi - domain proteins . </S>"
