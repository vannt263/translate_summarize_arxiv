    "those couplings above differ in the manner how they are inserted into the dirac equation @xcite .",
    "the minimal coupling ( [ ca ] ) is useful for studying the dynamics of a spin-1/2 charged particle in a magnetic field .",
    "for example , using this model , we can study landau levels book.1981.landau , aharonov - bohm effect @xcite , hall effect @xcite , and other effects associated with magnetic field .",

    "in other words , we can say that , for vector coupling , the potential couples to the charge . in the context of the dirac equation , this coupling has been used , for example , to study the influence of a harmonic oscillator on the aharonov - casher problem epjc.2013.73.2402 , the aharonov bohm effect for a spin-1/2 particle in the case that a @xmath2 potential is present @xcite , effects of nongauge potentials on the spin-1/2 aharonoh - bohm problem prd.1993.48.5935 , quasiclassical theory of the dirac equation with applications in the physics of heavy - light mesons @xcite and confining potentials with pure vector coupling @xcite . in the schrdinger theory , it also has important applications , such as , in the dynamics of an electron in a two - dimensional quantum ring prb.1996.53.6947,jmp.2012.53.023514 , quantum particles constrained to move on a conical surface @xcite and effect of singular potentials on the harmonic oscillator @xcite .    in the case of the scalar coupling ( [ cc ] )",
    ", it is added to the mass term of the dirac equation and , therefore , it can be interpreted as an effective , position - dependent mass and , furthermore , it also acts equally on particles and antiparticles .",

    "aop.2014.341.153 , the authors have not taken into account the term that depends explicitly on the spin in the pauli equation of motion . we have revisited the dynamics of the system in detail and show that the correct approach should involve the spin element . in this order",
    ", we have derived the pauli equation and studied the dynamics of the system taking into account exact symmetry spin and pseudospin limits . because of the equation of motion includes a @xmath112 function ,",
    "we have used the self - adjoint extension method to specify the proper boundary conditions at the origin .",
    "the analytical solutions of the model allow a calculation of expressions for the energy eigenvalues and wave functions for both symmetry limits .",
    "we verify that the presence of the spin element in the equation of motion introduces a correction in the expressions for the bound state energy and wave functions , a fact that does not occur in ref . @xcite .",
