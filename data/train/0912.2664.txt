    "<S> chiral symmetry of the 2-dimensional chiral gross - neveu model is broken explicitly by a bare mass term as well as a splitting of scalar and pseudo - scalar coupling constants . </S>",

    "<S> our main motivation for considering the lagrangian ( [ a1 ] ) is to study the competition of two different mechanisms of explicit chiral symmetry breaking , both of which are well understood in isolation . </S>",

    "<S> the second one is dynamical  breaking chiral symmetry through the interaction term while preserving parity . </S>",
    "<S> this seems to have no analogue in pure gauge theories . in the present work we do not attempt a complete solution of the model ( [ a1 ] ) which would require extensive numerical computations . to get a first overview of its physics content , we focus on the vicinity of the chiral limit at zero temperature , where everything can be done in closed analytical form .    </S>",
    "<S> following t  hooft @xcite , the large @xmath0 limit is implemented by letting @xmath3 while keeping @xmath4 and @xmath5 constant . </S>",
    "<S> as is well known , this justifies the use of semiclassical methods @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thereby the euler - lagrange equation of the lagrangian ( [ a1 ] ) gets converted into the dirac - hartree - fock equation , @xmath6 where the scalar and pseudo - scalar mean fields are related to condensates ( ground state expectation values ) through @xmath7 further simplifications arise if we concentrate on static problems in the vicinity of the chiral limit , where the potentials are slowly varying in space . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to invoke a systematic expansion in derivatives of @xmath8 and @xmath9 without assuming that the potentials are weak @xcite . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , we arrive at an effective bosonic field theory in which the hartree - fock potentials appear as complex scalar field ( written here in polar coordinates ) , @xmath10 note that this method can only handle full occupation of single particle levels at present . </S>",

    "<S> regularization and renormalization require only a straightforward extension of previous works . </S>",
    "<S> we replace the 3 bare parameters ( @xmath15 ) by physical parameters ( @xmath16 ) via @xmath17 the @xmath18 dependence is mandatory to ensure that the ultraviolet divergence in the sum over single particle energies is cancelled by the double counting correction . in the last line of eq .  </S>",

    "<S> we assume furthermore that the radius @xmath20 is fixed at the dynamical fermion mass and that the chiral angle field @xmath21 is slowly varying . these assumptions can be justified by looking at higher order terms of the derivative expansion , but they also have a very simple physical basis : close to the chiral limit , the would - be goldstone field @xmath21 ( the  pion \" field ) is the only one which can be modulated at low cost of energy @xcite . the renormalized ground state energy density ( including the vacuum contribution ) corresponding to lagrangian ( [ a1 ] ) then reads @xmath22 fermion number is given by the winding number of the chiral field @xcite @xmath23 . \\label{a9}\\ ] ] all we have to do is to minimize the energy @xmath24 classically . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , we will get information on the vacuum and its symmetries , as well as on light mesons and baryons in the vicinity of the chiral limit . </S>",
    "<S> for a homogeneous vacuum , the truncated derivative expansion is exact since the condensates are spatially constant . </S>",

    "<S> a non - trivial vacuum angle signals a non - vanishing pseudoscalar condensate and hence a breakdown of parity . </S>",

    "<S> expanding expression ( [ a24 ] ) around the vacuum angle @xmath50 to 2nd order in @xmath66 , we can simply read off the pion mass as follows :    * phase i ( @xmath67 ) @xmath68 * phase ii ( @xmath69 ) @xmath70    the last lines of eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ a26],[a27 ] ) may be regarded as the generalized gor relations in our model .    </S>",

    "<S> there is a unique stable minimum at @xmath38 , accompanied by small oscillations of frequency @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> if one increases @xmath73 , this minimum stays stable at first , but the frequency decreases like @xmath78 until it vanishes at the critical value @xmath79 . at this point , </S>",

    "<S> the gravitational field and the uniform rotation are two distinct mechanisms of breaking the original so(2 ) symmetry of the circle . </S>",
    "<S> the mapping of this mechanical problem onto our field theory model is obvious : u(1 ) chiral symmetry corresponds to the rotational symmetry of the circle , the bare mass plays the role of gravity , the difference in coupling constants corresponds to the uniform rotation , the pion masses to the frequencies of small oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> we only have to identify @xmath82 to map the two problems onto each other quantitatively . in principle , the regime @xmath33 could also be modeled by assuming that the particle is charged and invoking an additional constant magnetic field , but in the absence of a phase transition this is less instructive .    </S>",

    "<S> starting from a critical strength of the coupling ( @xmath69 ) , two symmetric minima appear together with scalar and pseudoscalar condensates ; parity is spontaneously broken . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanical model of a particle on a rotating circle in the gravitational field illustrates nicely the concomitant pitchfork bifurcation . </S>",
    "<S> the two ways of connecting two minima along the chiral circle are reflected in two baryons whose baryon numbers add up to 1 . </S>",
    "<S> these chirally twisted baryons are mathematically well known from studies of the double sine - gordon equation and quite different from another type of twisted bound state specific for the chiral limit @xcite . in our case , </S>",
    "<S> the baryons are stabilized by topology . </S>",
    "<S> shei s bound state is stabilized by partially filling the valence level and does not carry baryon number as a result of a cancellation with induced fermion number @xcite . in many respects </S>",
    "<S> the limits @xmath126 and @xmath127 are atypical so that previously explored 2-parameter versions of the present model can not convey the full picture of chiral symmetry breaking in 4-fermion models . in view of the rich structure of the 3-parameter model </S>",
    "<S> , it seems worthwhile to pursue its study , in particular to explore the fate of the symmetries at finite temperature and chemical potential . </S>"
