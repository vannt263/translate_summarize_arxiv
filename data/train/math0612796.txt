    "we will be interested in immersions of @xmath1 into @xmath5 .",
    "smale in s has surprised geometers when showing that any two immersions of @xmath1 in @xmath5 are regularly homotopic . since then immersions of @xmath1 ( and other closed surfaces ) into @xmath5 have been studied in many respects .",
    "one direction is asking about the various subconfigurations that may appear in such immersion .",
    "banchoff in b asked how many triple points may occur in a generic immersion of a closed surface @xmath6 into @xmath5 .",
    "his answer was that the number of triple point may be any number which is equal mod 2 to @xmath7 .",
    "li in l asked what are the possible graphs in @xmath5 that may appear as the intersection set of such immersion .",
    "his answer was that any daisy graph appears for some surface @xmath6 , and any daisy graph having an even number of arcs in each transverse component appears for some orientable @xmath6 .",
    "in this work we will be interested in the following question .",
    "given an immersion @xmath8 , its self intersection dissects @xmath1 into a collection of planar surfaces , and we ask what are the possible collections that may so appear .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath0 be a generic immersion .",
    "then the self intersection set of @xmath2 is composed of double lines and triple point .",
    "let @xmath9 be the multiplicity set of @xmath2 ( i.e. the inverse image of the intersection set ) , then @xmath10 is a graph , and we are interested in the connected components of @xmath11 . unless @xmath2 is an embedding , each such connected component is a planar surface .",
    "denote by @xmath12 a planar surface with @xmath13 boundary components , i.e. @xmath12 is the planar surface satisfying @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath15 be the number of components of @xmath11 which are of type @xmath12 .",
    "so we ask , what sequences @xmath16 may appear in this way .",
    "given a generic immersion @xmath17 , let @xmath4 be the number of triple points of @xmath2 , which is indeed even by b. the graph @xmath18 has @xmath19 vertices , and since each such vertex is of degree @xmath20 , @xmath10 has @xmath21 edges , and @xmath10 may also include some number @xmath22 of smooth circles .",
    "and so it is seen that @xmath23 .",
    "denote the connected components of @xmath11 by @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath25 be a regular neighborhood of @xmath10 , and let @xmath26 be a slightly diminished @xmath27 .",
    "then @xmath1 is obtained by gluing @xmath28 and @xmath26 along circles , and so @xmath29 . we see then that the sequence @xmath30 satisfies the linear equation @xmath31 we will refer to this restriction as ( e ) for _ equation_. furthermore , if @xmath32 , i.e. there are no triple points , then @xmath10 is a union of an even number @xmath22 of smooth circles , and so the number of components @xmath33 must in this case be odd .",
    "we will refer to this second restriction , which appears only when @xmath34 , as ( p ) for _ parity_.    in this work we prove the following .",
    "a sequence @xmath35 of non - negative integers may be realized by an immersion @xmath36 with @xmath4 triple points , iff it satisfies the restrictions ( e ) and ( p ) .",
    "in this section we show that our problem may be reduced to the problem of constructing immersions with a given number of triple points , satisfying ( e)(p ) , which dissect @xmath1 into pieces which are all discs , or all discs with one annulus .    given @xmath3 ,",
    "let @xmath40 be a sequence satisfying ( e)(p ) with @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath41 be the largest @xmath13 for which @xmath42 .",
    "note first that by ( e ) , necessarily @xmath43 . if @xmath44 , let @xmath45 be the sequence obtained from @xmath40 by subtracting 1 from @xmath46 , adding 1 to @xmath47 and then subtracting 2 from @xmath48 ( so if @xmath49 then @xmath50 ) .",
    "if @xmath51 satisfied ( e)(p ) then so does @xmath52 . by induction",
    "there is an immersion @xmath2 ( with @xmath4 triple points ) realizing the sequence @xmath53 , and note @xmath54 , i.e. there is at least one piece @xmath55 of type @xmath56 .",
    "change @xmath2 in a disc @xmath57 , to the immersion appearing in figure f1a , obtaining an immersion with sequence @xmath40 .",
    "so we may assume @xmath58 , i.e. we may use only discs and annuli . if @xmath59 , then let @xmath45 be obtained from @xmath40 by subtracting 2 from @xmath60 .",
    "if @xmath51 satisfied ( e)(p ) then so does @xmath52 . by induction",
    "there is an immersion @xmath2 ( with @xmath4 triple points ) realizing @xmath45 . by ( e )",
    "@xmath61 so there is at least one piece @xmath55 which is a disc . change @xmath2 in @xmath55 to the immersion appearing in figure f1b to obtain an immersions realizing @xmath40 .",
    "we assume from now on that @xmath62 and @xmath38 for all @xmath39 .",
    "if @xmath32 , then @xmath63 by ( e ) and so @xmath64 by ( p ) . this is realized in figure 1c .",
    "and so we also assume from now on that @xmath65 .",
    "we are left with the following problem : given @xmath65 we need to construct an immersion @xmath36 with @xmath4 triple points which dissects @xmath1 into @xmath66 discs and one annulus , and another immersion dissecting @xmath1 into @xmath66 discs only .",
    "we start with the case @xmath67 , and so there must be 8 discs and 1 or 0 annuli .",
    "start with three spheres , each embedded , and intersecting each other with two triple points , as in figure 2a .",
    "they are dissected into 12 pieces , which are all discs .",
    "a small neighborhood of one of the two triple points is as appears in figure 2b .",
    "the 12 different regions appearing in this neighborhood , belong to the 12 different discs into which the three spheres are dissected . in the figure , three of these regions are hidden .",
    "we now attach two tubes to the three spheres , merging them into one sphere .",
    "we add the tubes as in figure 3a to obtain 8 discs and 1 annulus , and as in figure 3b to obtain 8 discs only .",
    "we now explain the two figures . each piece shown in the three figures 2b , 3a ,",
    "3b is marked with a number .",
    "we will refer to each piece in a figure by both its number and the label of the figure , e.g. piece number 3 in figure 2b will be named piece 3 - 2b .",
    "the vertical tube appearing in figures 3a,3b will be called tube a , and the horizontal tube , tube b.    to obtain figure 3a from figure 2b , tube a is added as to connect discs 1 - 2b and 3 - 2b , and the tube is otherwise disjoint from the spheres .",
    "tube b on the other hand , connects the two vertical sheets , but it is half way above and half way below the horizontal sheet .",
    "the discs 1 - 2b , 2 - 2b , and an inner part of 3 - 2b have now merged via tube a and the upper half of tube b , into the one annulus 1 - 3a .",
    "discs 4 - 2b,5 - 2b have merged via the lower half of tube b into one disc 3 - 3a . and finally , tube b has opened a path in the horizontal sheet , which merges discs 6 - 2b,7 - 2b into the one disc 4 - 3a .",
    "the three discs hidden in figure 2b have not been touched , and are still hidden in figure 3a , and so we now have one annulus and eight discs .    to obtain figure 3b from figure 3a , we push tube a to the right so it will be half to the left and half to the right of the right hand vertical sheet . the annulus 1 - 3a has now turned into the disc 1 - 3b , and a new little disc 5 - 3b appeared .",
    "the right hand side of tube a now merges disc 4 - 3a and 6 - 3a into the one disc 4 - 3b . and",
    "the path opened by tube a in the right hand vertical sheet merges discs 3 - 3a and 5 - 3a into the one disc 3 - 3b . together with the three hidden discs we now have precisely eight discs .",
    "this completes the case @xmath67 .    for general @xmath3 ,",
    "start with @xmath68 embedded spheres , where one of the original three spheres of figure 2a is now replaced by @xmath3 concentric spheres as appears in figure 4 , for the case @xmath69 . at one of the triple points of the innermost sphere , we add two tubes as for the case @xmath67 , as in figure 3a or 3b , depending on whether we would like to end up with one or no annuli .",
    "each subsequent sphere in the family of concentric spheres is attached to the previous configuration by another tube , as in figure 5 , which depicts the case @xmath69 and no annuli . near the triple point in the back",
    "we see the original two tubes , and near the triple point in the front we see the new tube , which we name tube c , connecting the new sphere to the previous configuration . before adding tube c",
    ", the new sphere has added 8 new discs to the configuration .",
    "the upper half of tube c merges two of them into disc 1 - 5 , the lower half merges two of them into disc 3 - 5 , and the path it opened merges a new disc with an old disc into the disc 2 - 5 .",
    "a new disc is also created , disc 4 - 5 , so all together 6 new discs are added and nothing more , as needed ."
