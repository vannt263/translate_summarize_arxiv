    "in frustrated quantum spin lattices the interplay of quantum and frustration effects causes interesting physics , see e.g. the recent reviews [ ] .",
    "special attention was focused on the problem of the ground state ( gs ) nature of the heisenberg antiferromagnet ( hafm ) on the two - dimensional ( 2d ) kagom lattice . in the classical limit",
    "the gs of the hafm on the kagom lattice exhibits a huge non - trivial degeneracy ( see , e.g. refs . ) .",
    "intensive work over the last decade on the spin half quantum version of the model @xcite led to the conclusion that for the quantum hafm the gs is most likely a short - range ordered spin liquid without any kind of long - range order ( lro ) .",
    "however , we mention that the gs properties in the quantum case are far from being fully understood , yet .",
    "most of the conclusions are drawn from finite - lattice results of up to @xmath0 sites .",
    "very recently , the rotation - invariant greens - function method introduced by kondo and yamaji@xcite has been successfully applied on the spin - half hafm on the 2d kagom lattice@xcite . in the framework of",
    "this approach one obtains also a spin - liquid gs with an energy per spin @xmath1 which agrees well with the best available results obtained by other methods like the exact diagonalization @xcite ( @xmath2 ) and the coupled - cluster method @xcite ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "note that additional second - neighbor couplings may lead to a magnetically ordered gs phase @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that the dimensionality is crucial for the existence of order .",
    "roughly spoken one can say , the higher the dimensionality of the spin system the more the influence of quantum or thermal fluctuations is suppressed . for the gs of quantum spin systems",
    "one finds several examples , where the physical properties change basically going from one to two dimensions or from two to three dimensions .",
    "for instance , the transition from the linear - chain to the square - lattice hafm was studied in refs . .",
    "another example is the frustrated @xmath4-@xmath5 hafm , which exhibits a magnetically disordered quantum paramagnetic gs phase around @xmath6 for the 2d square lattice ( see , e.g. refs .",
    "and references therein ) but does not show this kind of quantum phase for the 3d body - centered cubic lattice @xcite . moreover , we know from the mermin - wagner theorem @xcite that the interlayer coupling in quasi-2d heisenberg magnets is crucial for magnetic ordering at finite temperatures .",
    "the role of the interlayer coupling in quasi-2d systems becomes particularly interesting if the decoupled layers themselves are magnetically disordered , e.g. due to strong frustration .",
    "though this question is relevant for real 3d solids with a layered arrangement of magnetic atoms it has been less studied yet . in this paper",
    "we address this question for the hafm on a congruently stacked kagom lattice .",
    "for such a system it is not known , whether an appropriate interlayer coupling may lead to a semi - classically ordered magnetic gs .",
    "however , one can expect that in the special limit of infinite ferromagnetic interlayer coupling the physics of the classical @xmath7 kagom antiferromagnet is obtained ( see sec .",
    "[ ferro ] ) .",
    "we emphasize , that the lanczos exact diagonalization of finite lattices being the most powerful method to study the hafm in the pure 2d kagom case is inappropriate in 3d .",
    "therefore we will discuss this question in our paper by the above mentioned spin - rotation - invariant greens - function method , having in mind that this method was successfully applied to the pure 2d case .",
    "in particular , we will calculate the correlation functions and the correlation lengths .",
    "in addition , we will discuss the linear spin - wave theory ( lswt ) for comparison .",
    "we consider congruently stacked kagom layers shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the vertices of this stacked lattice are occupied by @xmath8 spins one - half interacting via the heisenberg exchange coupling @xmath9 where the sum runs over all unit cells ( labeled by @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) and all spins within a unit cell ( labeled by running indices @xmath12 and @xmath13 , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "one unit cell contains three spins , therefore the number of cells is @xmath14 .",
    "the exchange coupling @xmath15 is non - zero for nearest neighbors ( nn ) , only .",
    "we introduce two different exchange parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 according to @xmath18 .",
    "since we are interested in the stacked kagom hafm , we consider @xmath19 but allow both signs for @xmath17 .",
    "we start with a brief discussion of the classical ground state ( gs ) of ( [ eq1 ] ) . because there is no additional frustration caused by @xmath17 ,",
    "the classical gs within a certain layer is not modified , and the nontrivial huge degeneracy due to corner - sharing triangles @xcite is not lifted .",
    "the only effect of a ferromagnetic ( antiferromagnetic ) interlayer coupling @xmath17 is the parallel ( antiparallel ) orientation of interacting spins of adjacent layers .",
    "thus for a certain classical gs the spin configurations in all layers are identical .",
    "two particular variants for the classical gs , namely the so - called @xmath20@xmath21@xmath20@xmath22 state and the so - called @xmath23 state ( see e.g.  fig .  17 in ref .  ) , are often used for discussing possible magnetic lro in the kagom lattice .",
    "these two particular planar states can also be considered as variants of possible gs ordering for the stacked kagom lattice .",
    "let us remind the reader of the fact , that starting from the @xmath20@xmath21@xmath20@xmath22 state as well as from the @xmath23 state the linear spin - wave theory ( lswt ) for the pure 2d kagom hafm @xcite leads to one flat zero mode and two degenerate modes producing divergent integrals in the sublattice magnetization , which might be taken as a hint on the absence of semi - classical magnetic order .",
    "for the stacked ( 3d ) system we start also from both the @xmath20@xmath21@xmath20@xmath22 state and the @xmath23 state and perform the lswt as usual . taking into account that we have three spins per unit cell we have to introduce three different kinds of magnons . as in the 2d case@xcite",
    "the spin wave spectrum is equivalent for all coplanar classical gs configurations because the directional cosine of in - plane neighbors is always @xmath24 while the directional cosine of out - of - plane neighbors is either @xmath25 or @xmath26 depending on the sign of @xmath17 .",
    "for @xmath27 we obtain for the spin - wave dispersions @xmath28 with @xmath29 for @xmath30 we find @xmath31 with @xmath32 the quantity @xmath33 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq2a ] ) , ( [ eq2 ] ) , ( [ eq3a ] ) , ( [ eq3 ] ) is the spin quantum number which can be considered as parameter of the model ( [ eq1 ] ) within the lswt .",
    "if @xmath17 goes to zero , the known flat zero mode as well as the both degenerate modes@xcite are recovered .",
    "but even for non - zero @xmath17 we have a flat zero mode @xmath34 and degenerate @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the @xmath37 plane for certain @xmath38 . for @xmath27",
    ", @xmath34 is a flat zero mode at @xmath39 , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 become degenerate at any @xmath40 for @xmath41 . for @xmath30",
    ", @xmath34 becomes a flat zero mode in the @xmath37 plane for @xmath42 , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are degenerate at any @xmath40 also for @xmath42 .",
    "thus , in both cases there is no finite sublattice magnetization due to the resulting logarithmic divergencies in the involved integrals .",
    "we conclude , that the lswt yields very similar behavior for the pure 2d and the 3d stacked case .    for completeness",
    "we give the expression for the gs energy per spin @xmath43 : @xmath44 where the @xmath45 are the respective spin wave dispersions from eqs .",
    "( [ eq2a ] ) , ( [ eq2 ] ) or ( [ eq3a ] ) , ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "the green s function method is one of the most powerful techniques for the investigation of quantum many - body systems and was successfully applied to spin systems over many decades .",
    "the rotation - invariant decoupling scheme was introduced by kondo and yamaji @xcite to study the one - dimensional heisenberg antiferromagnet and ferromagnet at finite temperatures .",
    "this decoupling scheme was developed to improve the description of magnetic short - range order and allows to describe magnetic order - disorder transitions driven by quantum fluctuations as well as by thermal fluctuations .",
    "later on the spin - rotation - invariant greens - function theory was used to discuss several two - dimensional models , for example the pure hafm@xcite , the frustrated @xmath4-@xmath5 hafm@xcite and the spatially anisotropic hafm on the square lattice @xcite as well as the doped square - lattice hafm ( @xmath46-@xmath47-model ) @xcite .",
    "the quasi - two - dimensional and the three - dimensional hafm have been investigated , too @xcite .",
    "let us outline the main ideas of this method based on the equation - of - motion technique . to evaluate the relevant correlation functions we have to calculate a set of fourier - transformed green s functions @xmath48 which are related to the dynamic spin susceptibilities by @xmath49 .",

    "furthermore , we have @xmath53 , i.e. it is sufficient to calculate @xmath54 to know all components of the correlation function @xmath55 .",
    "going beyond the rpa decoupling@xcite we consider in a second step the equation of motion for @xmath56 , @xmath57_{-}\\right\\rangle + \\left\\langle\\left\\langle -\\ddot{s}^{+}_{{\\bf{q}}\\alpha};s^{-}_{-{\\bf{q}}\\beta}\\right\\rangle\\right\\rangle_{\\omega}. \\label{eq6}\\ ] ] the combination of eqs .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) yields @xmath58_{-}\\right\\rangle + \\left\\langle\\left\\langle -\\ddot{s}^{+}_{{\\bf{q}}\\alpha};s^{-}_{-{\\bf{q}}\\beta}\\right\\rangle\\right\\rangle_{\\omega}. \\label{eq7}\\ ] ] the operator @xmath59,h]$ ] contains products of three spin operators along nn sequences .",
    "those operator products were treated in the spirit of the decoupling scheme by shimahara and takada @xcite .",
    "this decoupling is performed in the site representation of the green s functions .",
    "for example , the operator product @xmath60 is replaced by @xmath61 , where @xmath62 represent spin sites .",
    "the quantities @xmath63 are vertex parameters introduced to improve the approximation scheme . in the minimal version of the theory",
    "we introduce just as many vertex parameters as independent conditions for them can be formulated . because there are just two such conditions ( see below ) we consider two different parameters @xmath64 and @xmath65 attached to intralayer and interlayer correlators , respectively . after the decoupling we write",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) in a compact matrix form omitting the running indices @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the frequency and momentum matrices , respectively .",
    "since the unit cell contains three spins , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are @xmath70-matrices .",
    "for the sake of brevity we do not give the lengthy expressions for the matrix elements of @xmath67 and @xmath68 but give their eigenvalues , only .",
    "both matrices are hermitean and commute with each other .",
    "hence , the solution of ( [ eq8 ] ) in terms of the common set of normalized eigenvectors @xmath71 of @xmath69 reads @xmath72 for the eigenvalues @xmath73 of @xmath68 and @xmath74 of @xmath67 we find @xmath75 where @xmath76 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ dq ] ) .",
    "the correlators @xmath77 have to be determined self - consistently ; their indices correspond to a vector @xmath78 connecting two spins , i.e. @xmath79 . using the nn correlators @xmath80 and @xmath81 the gs energy per spin @xmath43 is given by @xmath82 the eqs .",

    "the relation between the correlators and the corresponding green s functions is given by the spectral theorem@xcite .",
    "its application to the correlators @xmath77 leads to six equations , a seventh one is the sum rule @xmath87 .",
    "one additional equation is obtained requiring that the matrix of the static susceptibility @xmath88 is isotropic in the limit @xmath89 @xcite , i.e. @xmath90 . from that constraint we obtain @xmath91 for the discussion of the magnetic gs ordering we consider the spin - spin correlation functions @xmath55 .",
    "a possible magnetic lro in the system is described via @xmath92 at large distances @xmath93 .",
    "more precisely , we consider , as in refs . , a condensation term @xmath94 in the fourier transformation @xmath95 of @xmath92 according to @xmath96 where * q * is the corresponding wave vector of the magnetic order and @xmath97 is given by @xmath98 the existence of @xmath99 is accompanied by a diverging static susceptibility @xmath69 at the magnetic wave vector @xmath100 .    to describe the magnetic order in a short - range ordered phase we use in addition to the spin - spin correlation functions the correlation length @xmath101 along a certain direction @xmath102 . to calculate @xmath101 we apply the procedure illustrated in refs . .",
    "we expand that eigenvalue of the static susceptibility @xmath69 , which is largest at the magnetic wave vector @xmath100 around this point @xmath103 .",
    "the relevant magnetic wave vector @xmath100 in the short - range ordered phase is that vector , where the largest eigenvalue of the static susceptibility has its maximum .",
    "then the square of the correlation length along @xmath102 is given by the factor in front of the square of the corresponding component of the @xmath104-vector @xmath105 .",
    "for illustration we give the expression for the intralayer correlation length @xmath106 in the pure kagom limit ( @xmath107 ) , @xmath108 , and omit the lengthy general expressions for the inter- and intralayer correlation lengths .",
    "solving the set of the eight self - consistency equations we find that there is no solution with a non - zero condensation term .",
    "therefore we conclude that within the applied rotation - invariant green s function decoupling scheme there is no indication of magnetic lro for the stacked 3d kagom hafm with antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling .",
    "this remarkable result is in accordance with the findings within the lswt ( see sec .",
    "[ lswt ] ) . to study the influence of the interlayer coupling on the gs magnetic short range order we calculate the spin - spin correlation functions and the correlation lengths . for convenience",
    "we set @xmath109 . in fig .",
    "[ cor_afm ] we show several first , second and third neighbor correlation functions .",
    "the strongest change is seen in the strengths of the interlayer correlators which increase in the interval @xmath110 , for @xmath111 their values are already close to those of the pure linear chain .",
    "the change in the intralayer correlators is small .",
    "while the nn intralayer correlator shows some decrease in strength , the second and third neighbor correlators are weakly increased for small @xmath17 .",
    "remarkably , already for @xmath112 the interlayer correlators become stronger than the intralayer correlators .",
    "note that in the limit @xmath113 our values for the gs energy as well as for the correlators coincide with available results reported in refs . .",
    "as illustrated above , to calculate the inter- and intralayer correlation lengths @xmath114 and @xmath106 we have to expand the extreme eigenvalue of the static susceptibility around @xmath103 , which is @xmath115 for all @xmath116 .",
    "the results for the intra- and interlayer correlation lengths are shown in fig .",
    "[ length_afm ] .",
    "the intralayer correlation length is of the order of the nn separation @xmath117 in the pure 2d limit .",
    "it increases up to a maximal value of about @xmath118 for @xmath111 and goes to zero for @xmath119 .",
    "the increase of the interlayer correlation length is stronger .",
    "though we expect a diverging @xmath120 for the isolated chain , it remains finite for any @xmath121 .",
    "this behavior is a drawback of the greens - function decoupling , which is not able to describe the critical gs with a power - law decay of the correlation functions of the linear - chain hafm .",
    "now we turn to the case @xmath30 which appears to be more complicated from the numerical point of view . starting from @xmath113 we find a solution of the self - consistency equations with zero condensation term until @xmath123 .",
    "that means we can conclude that for ferromagnetic interlayer coupling there is no indication for magnetic lro for @xmath124 , too . beyond this point",
    "our numerical procedure fails because of numerical instabilities in the @xmath104 space integrals .",
    "the reason for that consists in the specific behavior of the dispersion relations @xmath125 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq10aa ] ) , ( [ eq10b ] ) and ( [ eq10 ] ) .",
    "increasing the strength of the ferromagnetic interlayer coupling beyond @xmath126 we find that @xmath34 becomes more and more a flat zero mode in the @xmath127-@xmath128 plane at @xmath129 , and at the same time @xmath35 and @xmath36 become more and more degenerate leading to divergent terms in @xmath104 integrals .",
    "this behavior of the @xmath125 is in coincidence with our findings within the lswt , where we have found a flat zero - mode and two degenerate modes in the @xmath37-plane at @xmath42 ( see sec . [ lswt ] ) .",
    "we believe , that the physical interpretation of this behavior is connected with the classical limit ( large quantum number @xmath33 ) of the pure 2d kagom hafm . in the large @xmath33 limit",
    "the results of the lswt theory become reliable . in the 3d stacked kagom lattice with ferromagnetic @xmath17",
    "the spins along the chains become stronger coupled with increasing @xmath130 and can be considered as large @xmath33 ( quasi - classical ) composite spins .",
    "these quasi - classical spins are coupled kagom - like with each other , thus we are most likely faced with the classical hafm on the kagom lattice with its huge non - trivial degeneracy of the gs .",
    "though we do not have rigorous statements on the zero - temperature correlation functions of the classical kagom hafm , presumably at @xmath131 the average of the spin - spin correlation over the set of all ground states does not exhibit magnetic lro .",
    "@xcite hence we may conclude that the zero - temperature spin - spin correlation functions within a kagom layer do not exhibit lro for any ferromagnetic @xmath17 .",
    "however , the subtile interplay between the tendency to form large @xmath33 ( quasi - classical ) composite spins and the still remaining ( weak ) quantum fluctuations may lead to order by disorder effects . as it was argued in refs . for",
    "the pure 2d classical hafm on the kagom lattice at low temperatures @xmath132 , the entropy of fluctuations may lead to different relative boltzmann weights of the classical ground states this way favoring planar ordered ground states .",
    "presumably there is a nematic lro but an algebraic decay of the spin - spin correlation for @xmath132 @xcite .",
    "hence , for the stacked system considered in this paper at @xmath131 and for @xmath133 , due to remaining quantum fluctuations a nematic order accompanied by an algebraic decay in the intralayer spin - spin correlation functions is possible .    to describe the magnetic gs in more detail we present , similarly to the case @xmath134 , the spin - spin correlation functions and the correlation lengths in figs .",
    "[ cor_fm ] , [ length_fm ] . due to",
    "the above mentioned numerical problems our data are restricted to @xmath135 .",
    "several first , second and third neighbor correlation functions are shown in fig.[cor_fm ] . again",
    "the change in the intralayer correlators is very small , whereas the strengths of interlayer correlation functions increase with growing @xmath136 and become larger than those of intralayer correlation functions except for the nn correlation .",
    "the correlation lengths for @xmath137 belong to @xmath138 .",
    "we show the intra- ( @xmath106 ) and interlayer ( @xmath114 ) correlation lengths in fig .",
    "[ length_fm ] .",
    "@xmath106 and @xmath114 increase in the parameter region shown but are still of the order of the nn separation @xmath139 . obviously , the increase in @xmath114 ( i.e. along the chains ) is significantly stronger .",
    "we expect that @xmath114 diverges for large @xmath140 .",
    "as discussed above , also a diverging @xmath106 for @xmath141 would be possible indicating an algebraic decay of the correlation functions .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the gs of the stacked three - dimensional kagom spin half heisenberg antiferromagnet for ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling . to study the magnetic gs order",
    "we have applied a second - order green s function decoupling scheme going beyond the rpa .",
    "though one could expect that an increase in the dimension from two to three would stabilize magnetic order , we find some evidence that the interlayer coupling is not able to create magnetic lro within the antiferromagnetic kagom layers .",
