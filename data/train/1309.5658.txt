    "epitaxial growth is characterized by the deposition of new material on existing layers of the same material under high vacuum conditions .",
    "this technique is used in the semiconductor industry for the growth of thin films  @xcite .",
    "the crystals grown may be composed of a pure chemical element like silicon or germanium , or may either be an alloy like gallium arsenide or indium phosphide . in case of molecular beam epitaxy",
    "the deposition takes place at a very slow rate and almost atom by atom .",
    "the goal in most situations of thin film growth is growing an ordered crystal structure with flat surface .",
    "but in epitaxial growth it is quite usual finding a mounded structure generated along the surface evolution  @xcite .",
    "the actual origin of this mounded structure is to a large extent unknown , although some mechanisms ( like energy barriers ) have already been proposed . attempting to perform _ ab initio",
    "_ quantum mechanical calculations in this system is computationally too demanding , what opens the way to the introduction of simplified models .",
    "these have been usually developed within the realm of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics , and can be of a discrete probabilistic nature or have the form of a differential equation  @xcite .",
    "discrete models usually represent adatoms ( the atoms deposited on the surfaces ) as occupying lattice sites .",
    "they are placed randomly at one such site and then they are allowed to move according to some rules which characterize the different models . a different modelling possibility is using partial differential equations , which in this field are frequently provided with stochastic forcing terms . in this work",
    "we will focus on rigorous and numerical analyses of ordinary differential equations related to models which have been introduced in the context of epitaxial growth .",
    "we hope that a systematic mathematical study will contribute to the understanding of this sort of processes , which are relevant both in pure physics and its industrial applications , in the long term .",
    "the mathematical description of epitaxial growth uses the function @xmath0 which describes the height of the growing interface in the spatial point @xmath1 at time @xmath2 . although this theoretical framework can be extended to any spatial dimension @xmath3 , we will concentrate here on the physical situation @xmath4 .",
    "a basic modelling assumption is of course that @xmath5 is an univalued function , a fact that holds in a reasonably large number of cases  @xcite .",
    "the macroscopic description of the growing interface is given by a partial differential equation for @xmath5 which is usually postulated using phenomenological and symmetry arguments  @xcite .",
    "a prominent example of such a theory is given by the kardar - parisi - zhang equation  @xcite @xmath6 which has been extensively studied in the physical literature and it is currently being investigated for its interesting mathematical properties  @xcite .",
    "it has been argued however that epitaxial growth processes should be described by some equation coming from a conservation law and , in particular , that the term @xmath7 should not be present in such an equation  @xcite . to this end , among others , the conservative counterpart of the kardar - parisi - zhang equation was introduced  @xcite @xmath8 this equation is conservative in the sense that the first moment @xmath9 is constant if the appropriate boundary conditions are used .",
    "it can be considered as a higher order counterpart of the kardar - parisi - zhang equation , and it poses as well a number of fundamental mathematical questions  @xcite .    in this work we will focus on a variation of the last equation . its formal derivation will be presented in the following section .",
    "the remainder of this work will be devoted to clarify the analytical properties of the radial stationary solutions to the model under consideration .",
    "herein we will adopt a variational formulation of the surface growth equation , which has been postulated as a simple and yet physically relevant way of developing growth models  @xcite . in order to proceed with our formal derivation",
    ", we will assume that the height function obeys a gradient flow equation with a forcing term @xmath10.\\ ] ] the functional @xmath11 denotes a potential which describes the microscopic properties of the interface and , at the macroscopic scale , it is assumed that it can be expressed as a function of the surface mean curvature only  @xcite @xmath12 where the presence of the square root terms models growth along the normal to the surface , @xmath13 denotes the mean curvature and @xmath14 is an unknown function of @xmath13 .",
    "we will furthermore assume that this function can be expanded in a power series @xmath15 and subsequently formally apply the small gradient expansion , which assumes @xmath16 .",
    "this is a classical approximation in this physical context  @xcite and it is basic in the derivation of the kardar - parisi - zhang equation  @xcite among others . in the resulting equation , only linear and quadratic terms in the field @xmath5 and its derivatives are retained , as higher order nonlinearities are assumed not to be relevant in the large scale description of a growing interface  @xcite .",
    "the final result reads @xmath17 which is , as well as  ( [ ssg ] ) , a conservative equation in the sense that @xmath9 is constant if appropriate boundary conditions are used .",
    "we note that powers of the mean curvature higher than the cubic one in expansion  ( [ expansion ] ) do not contribute to equation  ( [ parabolic ] ) as they imply cubic or higher nonlinearities of the field @xmath5 or its derivatives .",
    "the terms in equation  ( [ parabolic ] ) have a clear geometrical meaning .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath18 is the result of the minimization of the zeroth order of the mean curvature , that is , it corresponds to the minimization of the surface area .",
    "its functional form simply reduces to standard diffusion .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath19 comes from the minimization of the mean curvature and actually it is the determinant of the hessian matrix , which is nothing but the small gradient approximation of the surface gaussian curvature .",
    "so we see that , through the small gradient approximation , _ a gradient flow pursuing the minimization of the mean curvature leads to a evolution which favors the growth of the gaussian curvature_. the term proportional to @xmath20 comes from the minimization of the squared mean curvature . a functional involving the squared mean curvature is known as willmore functional and it has its own status within differential geometry  @xcite .",
    "the bilaplacian accompanying @xmath20 is the corresponding linearized euler - lagrange equation of the willmore functional when looking for flat minimizers , and it has already appeared in the context of mathematical elasticity  @xcite .",
    "finally the term proportional to @xmath21 comes from the minimization of the cubic power of the mean curvature and it involves a nonlinear combination of laplacians of the field .",
    "we note that from a more puristic geometrical viewpoint one would retain only even powers of the mean curvature in expansion  ( [ expansion ] ) , which would give rise to a symmetric solution to the corresponding simplification of equation  ( [ parabolic ] ) ( i. e. , a solution invariant to the transformation @xmath22 ) .",
    "however , from a physical viewpoint , we are seeking for a solution to a partial differential equation which represents the interface between two different media ( solid structure and vacuum in the present case ) so this symmetry is not guaranteed a priori , and we need to retain the odd powers of the mean curvature in expansion  ( [ expansion ] ) .    for our current purposes we will focus on the associated stationary problem to a simplification of equation  ( [ parabolic ] ) . such an equation can be obtained employing well known facts from the theory of non - equilibrium surface growth .",
    "we may invoke classical scaling arguments in the physical literature to disregard the last term as a higher order correction which will not be present in the description of the largest scale properties of the evolving surface  @xcite .",
    "this practically reduces to setting @xmath23 in equation  ( [ parabolic ] ) . in epitaxial growth",
    "one may phenomenologically set @xmath24 , and we will assume so for the rest of this work .",
    "the underlying physical reason is that the diffusion proportional to @xmath18 is triggered by the effect of gravity on adatoms , and this effect is negligible in the case of epitaxial growth  @xcite .",
    "the resulting equation reads @xmath25 this partial differential equation can be thought of as been an analogue of equation  ( [ ssg ] ) .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that this equation might constitute a suitable description of epitaxial growth in the same sense equation ( [ ssg ] ) is so , and it even shows more intuitive geometric properties  @xcite .",
    "so , at the physical level , we can consider equation  ( [ parabolic2 ] ) as a higher order conservative counterpart of the kardar - parisi - zhang equation . at the mathematical level we can consider it as a sort of gaussian curvature flow  @xcite which is stabilized by means of a higher order viscosity term .",
    "furthermore , this viscosity term , as we have seen , has a clear geometrical meaning .",
    "as we explain above , in this work we are concerned with the stationary version of ( [ parabolic2 ] ) , which reads @xmath26 after getting rid of the equation constant parameters by means of a trivial re - scaling of field and coordinates .",
    "our last assumption is that the forcing term @xmath27 is time independent .",
    "this type of forcing is known in the physical literature as columnar disorder , and it has an actual experimental meaning within the context of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics  @xcite .",
    "the constant @xmath28 is a measure of the intensity of the rate at which new particles are deposited , and for physical reasons we assume @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "we will devote our efforts to rigorously and numerically clarify the existence and multiplicity of solutions to this elliptic problem when set on a radially symmetric domain .",
    "we start looking for radially symmetric solutions of boundary value problem  ( [ pro0 ] ) with @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the radial coordinate , and homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "we set the problem on the unit disk .",
    "that is , we look for solutions of the form @xmath33 where @xmath34 by means of a direct substitution we find @xmath35 ' \\right\\ } ' = \\frac{1}{r } \\ , \\tilde{u } ' \\tilde{u } '' + \\lambda f(r),\\ ] ] where @xmath36 , and the conditions @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 ; the first one imposes the existence of an extremum at the origin and the second and third ones are the actual boundary conditions .",
    "the fourth boundary condition is technical and imposes higher regularity at the origin .",
    "if this condition were removed this would open the possibility of constructing functions @xmath41 whose second derivative had a peak at the origin .",
    "this would in turn imply the presence of a measure at the origin when calculating the fourth derivative of such an @xmath41 , so this type of function can not be considered as an acceptable solution of  ( [ fullradial ] ) whenever @xmath42 is a function . throughout this section",

    "so far we have proven the existence of at least two solutions to both dirichlet and navier problems . in this section",
    "we will clarify the nature of these solutions by means of numerically solving the boundary value problems employing a shooting method .",

    "the results of the numerical experiments are plotted in figure  [ shooting2 ] .",

    "we have analyzed a differential equation appearing in the physical theory of epitaxial growth . we have started formally introducing the corresponding partial differential equation and then we have focused on radial solutions to its stationary counterpart .",
    "the resulting equation has been posed in the unit disk in the plane subjected to two different sets of boundary conditions .",
    "we have proven the existence of at least two solutions to both boundary value problems for small enough data . in each problem",
    "we have observed both solutions numerically and identified one of them with the local minimum of our `` energy '' functional and the other one with a mountain pass critical point . due to the qualitatively similar results in both cases , the following assertions , and in particular the conjectures , refer to both boundary value problems .",
    "our numerical simulations have revealed that the solutions are ordered in the sense that the one corresponding to the minimum lies strictly below ( except for the boundary point @xmath204 ) the one corresponding to the mountain pass critical point .",

    "we also conjecture the mountain pass solution is dynamically unstable .",
    "we have numerically observed both solutions become closer for @xmath28 approaching the critical value separating existence from nonexistence , so we conjecture that the transition from existence to nonexistence as we vary the parameter @xmath28 is a saddle - node bifurcation for the corresponding evolution problem .",

    "if the forcing were stochastic the equilibrium state would become metastable . for a large forcing term",
    "there are no equilibrium states , so the system will keep on evolving forever in a genuine nonequilibrium fashion . in the theory of nonequilibrium growth ,",
    "in which the forcing is normally assumed stochastic , it is known that these features affect both morphology and dynamics of the evolving interface  @xcite . in the case of existence of a local minimum",
    "this would imply in turn the existence of transient behavior , as found in different models of epitaxial growth  @xcite .",
    "nonexistence of this state would mean that the asymptotic state is rapidly achieved .",
