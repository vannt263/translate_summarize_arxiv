    "here , we summarize the essential points of our response to halatek and frey . a detailed response can be found below .",
    "+ halatek and frey  @xcite contest our claim that a two - dimensional effective model of min - protein dynamics accounts for geometry sensing by self - organized patterns  @xcite .",
    "our model notably includes transient binding of mine to the membrane , a process that to our knowledge was first suggested by meacci and kruse  @xcite and then studied in context of mine - ring formation by derr et al .",
    "the impact of mine membrane binding on min - protein patterns in a cellular geometry was first studied subsequently by arjunan and tomita  @xcite .",
    "hsieh et al . initially suggested direct membrane binding of mine , which has been attributed to positively charged residues located at positions 10 - 12 of mine  @xcite .",
    "in loose et al , we mutated these residues and found that the corresponding mutant mine ( c1 ) still supports dynamic instability of the min system in vitro , but fails to displace minc from mind  @xcite .",
    "in a subsequent structural study by park et al .",
    "@xcite a nascent amphipathic helix at the extreme n - terminus of mine was identified , which allows mine to directly interact with the membrane .",
    "in contrast to the study by hsieh et al , the residues involved in membrane binding were found to be located at positions 3 - 8 . park et al . suggested that residues 10 - 12 might still contribute to membrane - binding , but are more important for the interaction with mind since mutations here impair mine s ability to displace minc from mind . in light of this more recent data , we conclude that the mine c1 mutant we tested still has some affinity to the membrane .",
    "so far , we have not been able to study the effect of mutations of residues 3 - 8 in our in vitro assay , however it was found they lead to erratic oscillations in vivo ( j. lutkenhaus personal communication ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that mine membrane binding is required for the formation of regular min protein patterns and consequently geometry sensing .",
    "in contrast to the allegations by halatek and frey the mechanism studied in ref .",
    "does account for the observed minde protein patterns .",
    "this holds for a two- dimensional as well as for a three - dimensional implementation , see below .",
    "the parameters presented in ref .   were unfortunate in that the corresponding solutions depended on the size of the gold layer implemented in the simulations .",
    "as the data presented below show , however , this is not a short - coming of either the mechanism nor the model .",
    "furthermore , the purpose of our model was to show that accounting for transient mine membrane binding allows us to reproduce the effect of geometry sensing observed in experiments .",
    "parameters were not optimized to yield quantitative agreement with experiments or to reproduce the exact form of the density profiles .",
    "more importantly and in contrast to all other published models , however , the mechanism we studied is able to qualitatively reproduce all hitherto observed min - protein patterns .",
    "the two - dimensional model studied in ref .   is an effective description of the min - protein dynamics in three dimensions .",
    "solving the corresponding model equations in three dimensions can also produce patterns similar to those observed in experiment . although a formal mapping between the three - dimensional and the two - dimensional model is still lacking , we find that there is a correspondence between the patterns generated by both models .",
    "this feature highlights the robustness of the mechanism that we propose to explain the essential features of the min - protein dynamics observed in vivo and in vitro .    in conclusion , while our choice of parameters might have been unfortunate in some respects , we maintain our claim that transient membrane binding of mine is able to reproduce the experimentally observed geometry sensing .",
    "in our work  [ ] , we presented experimental data showing that spontaneous surface waves of min proteins on supported lipid bilayers can be guided by lateral confinement . in these experiments binding of the min proteins to the surface",
    "was restricted to membrane patches of different shapes and sizes by covering the rest of the surface with a passivating gold layer .",
    "the patches were either arranged in arrays or isolated , separated by about 50 @xmath0 m from each other .",
    "we analyzed the min - protein waves on the membrane patches by using an effective two - dimensional description of the protein dynamics on the surface . in this effective model",
    ", we accounted for persistent binding of mine to the membrane .",
    "while this property had already been proposed to be important for the formation of the so - called e - ring [ ] - [ ] , an accumulation of mine at the rim of the polar mind zone in vivo , experimental evidence for this assumption has only been available recently .",
    "our model describes the evolution of the densities @xmath1 and @xmath2 of mind and mine not bound to the membrane and of the densities @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 of membrane - bound mind , minde complex , and mine , respectively , using a meanfield approach . in our deterministic ,",
    "effective two - dimensional description , the densities are all surface densities .",
    "the densities @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are restricted to the regions of the membrane patches .",
    "the complete system , however , is larger and comprises also regions corresponding to the gold layer .",
    "the latter regions are only accessible to mind and mine in solution .",
    "explicitly , the equations read @xmath6 for the diffusion currents of mind and mine not attached to the membrane , we apply periodic boundary conditions at the system s boundaries .",
    "the membrane patches do not affect diffusion of the unbound proteins .",
    "in addition , we apply zero flux conditions on the currents for the membrane - bound densities perpendicular to the patch boundaries .",
    "the various constants @xmath7 denote the diffusions constants for species @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "the values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 parameterize binding of mind to the membrane , @xmath15 binding of mine .",
    "dissociation of minde complexes is described by @xmath16 and @xmath17 giving unbinding of mind with mine staying on the membrane or not , respectively . finally , @xmath18 is the maximal protein density on the surface .",
    "let us point out that this description does not account for possible intermolecular interactions between membrane - bound molecules .",
    "there is some experimental evidence for such interactions  @xcite and they have been shown to be able to trigger a dynamic instability that leads to pattern formation of min proteins  @xcite . however , these interactions have not been characterized experimentally and their molecular nature is presently unknown .",
    "we thus refrain at this point from making any ad hoc assumptions .",
    "as we will see below , these suggested interactions are not necessary to comprehensibly describe the influence of the geometry on the min - protein patterns nor for giving a comprehensive description of all min - protein patterns observed in vivo up to date  @xcite .",
    "they are presumably important , though , to get a quantitative agreement of the wave form and the residence times of the min proteins on the membrane as we will see below .    the solutions to these equations we presented in ref .",
    "[ ] were obtained for parameter values that present certain shortcomings . however , as we show here , these shortcomings are indeed linked to the parameter values and not to the model per se . since a comprehensive numerical study of parameter space is prohibited by limited computer power .",
    "further quantitative experiments are needed to provide constraints on parameters . for the time",
    "being it seems appropriate to focus on certain features of the min - protein patterns .",
    "we will come back to this point in the discussion at the end of this article .",
    "we will now give a point - to - point response to the issues raised by halatek and frey .",
    "for convenience of the reader , the points of halatek and frey are copied in this text .      _",
    "_ + in contrast to the allegations by halatek and frey , the computational data were obtained from the dynamic equations given above and in the article .",
    "our model includes the densities @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which describe mine bound to the membrane either in a complex with mind or alone .",
    "the figures presented in ref .  [ ] show patterns similar to the ones observed in the corresponding experiments . in ref .",

    "we considered an effective 2d model as has been done in several studies before our work .",
    "the relation between the full three - dimensional model and the effective 2d model is not obvious and remains to be worked out . for the time being we can say , though , that both models produce similar patterns for the membrane - bound protein densities .",
    "below , we give results that show that the mechanism studied by our computational analysis in 2d and 3d yields patterns similar to the experimental patterns . in our 3d calculations we used a bulk height of 90@xmath0 m and we observed that the cytosolic concentrations were essentially homogenous above a height of about 15@xmath0 m . furthermore , as shown in fig .",
    "s1 in the appendix of ref .",
    "[ ] , the protein patterns are indeed confined to a narrow region above the membrane above which the corresponding fluorescence intensitiy appears to be homogenous . + _ _",
    "+ we are not sure , what halatek and frey have in mind here . in our two - dimensional computational model",
    "we can not study the effect of the bulk volume on the patterns formed , because we do not have an exact mapping of the 3d model to 2d .",
    "we show below that in a full three - dimensional model of the same mechanism as used for the two - dimensional model in ref .",
    "[ ] , the bulk volume does not affect the membrane patterns as long as it is higher than 15@xmath0 m .",
    "+ for the parameter sets given below for the calculations in 2d and 3d , our computational model produces all observed patterns , see figs .",
    "[ fig : aspectratios2d]-[fig : aspectratio3d ] . in the 3d calculations ,",
    "the total mind and mine densities correspond to the values used in ref .",
    "+ _ _ + as shown in figures [ fig : aspectratios2d ] and [ fig : rightangle ] below , our computational model ( or rather the molecular processes implemented in the model ) can reproduce the experimentally observed patterns on patched membranes in a robust way and independently of the boundary conditions chosen for the gold layer . in figures  [ fig :",
    "aspectratios2d ] and [ fig : rightangle ] , we present numerical solutions that were obtained for patches surrounded by an inert region of sizes 1.625mm@xmath191.625 mm and 2.303mm@xmath193.290 mm , using the parameter set given in table  [ tab : parametersinvitro ] for the 2d model defined above .",
    "solutions were obtained by using comsol multiphysics 4.1^^. far away from the patch , the densities @xmath1 and @xmath2 are essentially homogenous and the size of the surrounding gold layer can be increased further without affecting the pattern on the patch . while we agree that the parameter set used in ref .",

    "_ + transient membrane - binding by mine was first suggested in ref .",
    "[ ] to underlie mine - ring formation and was then studied in this context by derr et al .",
    "arjunan and tomita studied a system , in which mine could directly bind to another membrane - bound mind after inducing detachment of a membrane - bound mind  @xcite . in difference to the model presented in ref .",
    "[ ] , though , these authors only considered mine dimers forming a complex with mind to stay on the membrane ; in absence of mind , mine could not stay bound to the membrane .",
    "the work by arjunan and tomita was the first to numerically study a stochastic model for min - protein dynamics in a cellular geometry incorporating this feature .",
    "it nicely demonstrated the formation of a mine - ring in this setting .",
    "+ _ _ + halatek and frey falsely claim that experiments by park _",
    "_ disprove our finding that membrane binding is required or responsible for geometry sensing . in their paper , park _ et al .",
    "_ identified the mine double - mutant mine@xmath20 , which does not bind to the membrane _ in vivo _ and is supposedly consecutively activated for mind binding . while it is true that cells with this mutant show similar colonies on agar plates as with the wildtype protein , park _ et al",
    "_ make no comment about cell morphology , cell length distributions nor the dynamics of the min proteins _ in vivo_. therefore , ",
    "assuming that the mine@xmath20 mutant most likely restores pole - to - pole min oscillations ( hence , geometry sensing ) without requiring membrane binding  as halatek and frey do in their letter is unfounded .",
    "in fact , this mine mutant could even fail to induce oscillations but lead to a static min protein distribution to regulate cell division as seen in _",
    "b. subtilis_. to conclude , instead of making assumptions about how proteins might behave , it is important to test these mine mutants for their ability to initiate protein pattern formation _ in vivo _ as well as _ in vitro_.    _ _ + it would be interesting to test experimentally whether mine membrane binding is required for pattern formation or not . in any case , we do not see a contradiction in the two statements ( mine membrane binding is required for pattern formation and mine membrane binding is necessary for geometry sensing ) .",
    "furthermore , using other models we did not find geometry sensing in the absence of mine membrane binding , so we maintain our claim that mine membrane binding is necessary for geometry sensing .",

    "only steric interactions are captured by the maximal protein density on the membrane .",
    "in contrast to the experimental findings reported in ref .",
    "[ ] , the diffusion constant of membrane - bound mind and mine does thus not change within the wave the diffusion constant of individual molecules was measured , whereas , in our meanfield description , the chemical diffusion constants are used . ] .",
    "furthermore , in our description the residence time of mind on the membrane decreases as the rear of the wave is approached .",
    "this is simply due to an increase in the concentration of membrane - bound mine towards the rear of the wave .",
    "this is again different from the experimental findings reported in ref .",
    "[ ] , where the residence time of mind increased towards the rear of the wave . as mentioned in that work , this observation suggests that intermolecular interactions become more likely at the rear of the wave .",
    "these interactions could then stabilize the membrane - bound state of mind .",
    "+ _ _ + unfortunately , we do not know the results of halatek and frey s simulations nor the parameters they used to comment meaningfully on the discrepancy they mention here .",
    "concerning the propagation velocity of the waves , which is the quantity discussed here , the relevant concentrations of mind and mine are those at the trailing edge of the wave .",

    "[ ] were read of the density profiles at the position , where the mine concentration has reached 85% of its maximum value .",
    "furthermore , we note that only mine was labeled in the corresponding experiment , such that it remains obscure to us , how halatek and frey obtained the ratio of membrane - bound mine to membrane - bound mind from the published experimental data .",
    "in summary , we maintain that the mechanism encoded in the dynamic equations given above is able to reproduce the patterns observed on membrane patches reported in ref .",
    "the mechanism is also able to reproduce the in vivo patterns as we describe in ref .",
    "it furthermore predicts the existence of traveling waves in sufficiently long cells , which we found also experimentally .",
    "this supports the important role of the persistent interaction of mine with the membrane as we concluded in ref .",
    "[ ] . as supported by the findings by park et al .",
    "this persistent interaction of mine is most likely due to direct , though transient membrane binding of mine via an n - terminal amphipathic helix .",
    "a detailed analysis of the model and notably of the relation between the effective description in two spatial dimensions and the model in three spatial dimensions remains to be done .",
    "furthermore , more experimental input will be needed to constrain parameter values , notably those describing interactions between membrane - bound proteins , such that a meaningful quantitative comparison between the model calculations and experimental observations will be possible . in this context , one should note , in particular , that  to our knowledge  none of the models presented prior to the one introduced in ref .",
    "[ ] had been reported to qualitatively reproduce all observed min - protein patterns _ in vivo _ as well as in reconstitution experiments , whereas the model of ref .",
    "[ ] does  @xcite .",
    "we are thus convinced that our model is a good starting point for attempting also a quantitative description .",
    "obviously , as we learn more about the system , further modifications of the equations might be necessary and parameter values will be optimized . as stated above , notably , intermolecular interactions could account for some features of the dynamics of membrane - bound min proteins .",
    "independently of possibly necessary changes of the model equations , limited computational resources and/or the lack of sufficient experimental constraints currently prohibit the identification of a parameter set that would reproduce at the same time , wave forms , speeds , lengths , and protein residence times .",
    "the aim of the theoretical part of ref .",
