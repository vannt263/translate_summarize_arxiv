    "complex systems  together with their dynamical behavior known as complexity  are thought to pervade much of the natural , informational , sociological , and economic world @xcite .",
    "complex systems are probably best defined in terms of a list of common features which distinguish them from ` simple ' systems , and from systems which are just ` complicated ' as opposed to being complex . a list of complex system ` stylized facts ' should include : feedback and adaptation at the macroscopic and/or microscopic level , many ( but not too many ) interacting parts , non - stationarity , evolution , coupling with the environment , and observed dynamics which depend upon the particular realization of the system .",
    "casti has argued that @xcite ` .... a decent mathematical formalism to describe and analyze the [ so - called ] el farol problem would go a long way toward the creation of a viable theory of complex , adaptive systems ' .",
    "the rationale behind this statement is that the el farol problem , which was originally proposed by brian arthur @xcite to demonstrate the essence of complexity in financial markets involving many interacting agents , incorporates the key features of a complex system in an everyday setting .",
    "very briefly , the el farol problem concerns the collective decision - making of a group of potential bar - goers ( i.e. agents ) who repeatedly try to predict whether they should attend a potentially overcrowded bar on a given night each week .",
    "they have no information about the others predictions .",
    "indeed the only information available to each agent is global , comprising a string of outcomes ( ` overcrowded ' or ` undercrowded ' ) for a limited number of previous occasions .",
    "hence they end up having to predict the predictions of others .",
    "no ` typical ' agent exists , since all such typical agents would then make the same decision , hence rendering their common prediction scheme useless . with the exception of ref .",
    "@xcite , the physics literature has focused on a simplified binary form of the el farol problem called the minority game ( mg ) as introduced by challet and zhang @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present a theoretical framework for describing a class of complex systems comprising competitive multi - agent populations , which we refer to as b - a - r ( binary agent resource ) systems .",
    "the resulting crowd - anticrowd theory is not limited to mg - like games , even though we focus on mg - like games in order to demonstrate the accuracy of the approach .",
    "the theory is built around the correlations or ` crowding ' in strategy - space .",
    "since the theory only makes fairly modest assumptions about a specific game s dynamical behavior , it can describe the dynamics in a wide variety of systems comprising competitive populations @xcite .",
    ", each agent decides between action @xmath0 and action @xmath1 based on the predictions of the @xmath2 strategies that he possesses .",
    "a total of @xmath3 $ ] agents choose @xmath0 , and @xmath4 $ ] choose @xmath1 .",
    "agents may be subject to some underlying network structure which may be static or evolving , and ordered or disordered ( see refs .",

    "( e.g. a bar customer , a commuter , or a market agent ) decides whether to enter a game where the choices are action @xmath1 ( e.g. attend the bar , take route a , or buy ) and action @xmath0 ( e.g. go home , take route b , or sell ) .",
    "the global information available to the agents is a common memory of the most recent @xmath6 outcomes , which are represented as either 0 ( e.g. bar attendance below seating capacity @xmath7 ) or 1 ( e.g. bar attendance above seating capacity @xmath7 ) .",
    "hence this outcome history is represented by a binary bit - string of length @xmath6 . for general @xmath6",

    "a strategy consists of a predicted action , @xmath0 or @xmath1 , for each possible history bit - string .",
    "hence there are @xmath14 possible strategies .    , together with some example strategies ( left ) .",
    "the strategy space shown is known as the full strategy space ( fss ) and contains all possible permutations of the actions @xmath0 and @xmath1 for each history .",

    "the strategy space shown is known as the full strategy space ( fss ) and contains all possible permutations of the actions @xmath0 and @xmath1 for each history . as such there are @xmath15 strategies in this space .",

    "their net effect on the excess demand @xmath22=n_{+1}[t]-n_{-1}[t]$ ] ( which is an important quantity in a socio - economic setting such as a financial market ) therefore cancels out at each timestep , regardless of the history .",
    "hence they will not contribute to fluctuations in @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "uncorrelated_. for example , any two agents using the strategies @xmath23 and @xmath20 respectively , would take the opposite action for two of the four histories , and the same action for the remaining two histories .",
    "if the histories occur equally often , the actions of the two agents will be uncorrelated on average .",
    "note that the strategies in the rss can be labeled by @xmath24 .",
    "the strategy allocation among agents can be described in terms of a tensor @xmath25 describing the distribution of strategies among the @xmath26 individual agents .",
    "this strategy allocation is typically fixed from the beginning of the game , hence acting as a quenched disorder in the system .",
    "the rank of the tensor @xmath25  is given by the number of strategies @xmath2 that each agent holds .",
    "we note that a single @xmath27 ` macrostate ' corresponds to many possible ` microstates ' describing the specific partitions of strategies among the agents .",
    "hence the present crowd - anticrowd theory retained at the level of a given @xmath27 , describes the set of all games which belong to that same @xmath27 macrostate .",
    "we also note that although @xmath27 is not symmetric , it can be made so since the agents do not distinguish between the order in which the two strategies are picked .",

    "this implies a particular @xmath43 , and hence the time - averagings within the crowd - anticrowd theory must be carried out for that particular choice of @xmath43 .",
    "however this problem can still be cast in terms of the crowd - anticrowd approach , since the averagings are then just carried out over some sub - set of paths in history space , which is conditional on the path along which the complex system is already heading .",
    "we have been discussing a complex system based on multi - agent dynamics , in which both deterministic and stochastic processes co - exist , and are indeed intertwined .",
    "depending on the particular rules of the game , the stochastic element may be associated with any of five areas : ( i ) disorder associated with the strategy allocation and hence with the heterogeneity in the population , ( ii ) disorder in an underlying network . both ( i ) and ( ii )",
    "might typically be fixed from the outset ( i.e. , quenched disorder ) hence it is interesting to see the interplay of ( i ) and ( ii ) in terms of the overall performance of the system @xcite . the extent",
    "to which these two ` hard - wired ' disorders might then compensate each other , as for example in the parrondo effect or stochastic resonance , is an interesting question .",
    "such a compensation effect might be engineered , for example , by altering the rules - of - the - game concerning inter - agent communication on the existing network .",
    "three further possible sources of stochasticity are ( iii ) tie - breaks in the scores of strategies , ( iv ) a stochastic rule in order for each agent to pick which strategy to use from the available @xmath2 strategies , as in the thermal minority game , ( v ) stochasticity in the global resource level @xmath104 $ ] ( e.g. bar seating capacity ) due to changing external conditions . to a greater or lesser extent",
