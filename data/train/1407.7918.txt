    "the problem we address in the present paper is a complete characterization of the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic scenario for the symmetric simple exclusion process ( ssep ) with slow boundary .",
    "the ssep is described by particles that move as independent random walks in @xmath8 , under the exclusion rule , which says that two particles can not occupy the same site at the same time ( the so - called _ fermions _ in physics ) .",
    "let us describe this process in terms of clocks : at each bond we associate a different poisson clock with parameter @xmath3 , and suppose all of them are independent . when a clock rings , either the occupation at the sites connected by the corresponding bond are exchanged , if one of the sites is occupied and the other is not , or nothing happens if both sites are occupied or both are empty .",
    "the parameters of the poisson clocks are called _ exchange rates_. by _ slow boundary _ we mean that particles can enter or leave the system at the site @xmath3 with rate equal to @xmath9 or @xmath10 , respectively , while at the site @xmath11 particles can also enter or leave the system with rate equal to @xmath12 or @xmath13 .",
    "we consider the parameters @xmath14 in @xmath15 and @xmath1 .",
    "[ fig:1 ]    if one wants to produce mass transfer between two infinite reservoirs of particles with different densities , one way to do that is by connecting them .",
    "this connection will allow particles to change reservoirs and produce the desired mass transfer .",
    "there are many works that consider similar models .",
    "for example , in @xcite the authors consider a model where deaths can only happen in an interval around the left boundary and births in an interval around the right boundary .",
    "their model has some similarity with the case @xmath6 described above .",
    "two other similar models are presented in @xcite : they correspond to the case @xmath16 , which means that there is no slow boundary .",
    "namely , in @xcite they study the ssep in @xmath17 with births and deaths occurring only in the sites @xmath3 and @xmath11 with fixed rates : in the left boundary particles are born with rate @xmath18 and die with rate @xmath19 , while in the right boundary this rates are @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "in @xcite the ssep is defined in @xmath22 and the boundary is free , in a sense that particles can be born or die in different sites , depending on the current configuration . in that work",
    "there is no slow boundary either .",
    "finally , we also have the work @xcite , where there are no reservoirs , but it is worth to be mentioned here , because it presents a `` battery effect '' that produces a current of particles through the system .",
    "such a system takes place in the discrete torus @xmath23 , with @xmath2 points , and the `` battery effect '' is due to a single modified bond @xmath24 , where the jump rates to the right and to the left are different .    in the present paper ,",
    "our goal is to understand the collective behavior of the time evolution of the microscopic system described above . in order to do this",
    ", we study the limit of the time evolution of the spatial density of particles , when we re - scale the time and the space in a suitable way .",
    "this scaling procedure limit leads to the so - called _ hydrodynamic limit _ , which is usually characterized by the weak solution of some partial differential equation ( pde ) called the _",
    "hydrodynamic equation_.    we observe that the model analysed here was motivated by a process considered in @xcite , the ssep with slow bond . in these three papers",
    "the authors consider the ssep in the discrete torus , @xmath23 , with @xmath2 points , where an usual bond has an exchange rate equal to @xmath3 and an unique bond ( the slow bond ) has a rate proportional to @xmath25 .",
    "the papers @xcite show different hydrodynamic behaviors depending on the range of @xmath20 . in all of them",
    "the hydrodynamic equation is the heat equation , and boundary conditions vary depending on the value of @xmath20 , comprising three different boundary conditions .",
    "the intuitive idea is that if we `` open '' the discrete torus in the slow bond , then this bond will behave like a `` boundary '' . in the case",
    "@xmath26 , the boundary conditions found in @xcite show a connection between the extremes @xmath27 and @xmath3 .",
    "this motivates us to study the model considered in the present paper , where the boundary is disconnected . in the paper",
    "@xcite three different behaviors ( depending on the value of @xmath20 ) are obtained for the fluctuations of the model studied .",
    "the study of the fluctuations for the ssep with slow boundary is an open question .",
    "now , let us concentrate on the results of the present paper : as in @xcite , the model we study here has three different hydrodynamical behaviors , depending on the range of @xmath4 : the first case is @xmath5 , where we obtain as hydrodynamic equation the heat equation with dirichlet boundary condition : @xmath28 we notice that the case @xmath29 has already been considered in @xcite .",
    "here in our paper the rate in the slow boundary is smaller than in the case @xmath16 , but not small enough to modify the hydrodynamic equation , and the system behaves in the same way , with the same dirichlet boundary condition obtained in @xcite .",
    "we observe that our techniques can also be used in the case @xmath16 .",
    "however , when we analyse the second case , where the parameter @xmath4 belongs to the set @xmath30 , the rate in the boundary is much smaller than in the previous case , and this makes births and deaths of particles rare . in the macroscopic level , the boundary is isolated , and we get neumann boundary condition : @xmath31 we also have a third case , which is the critical value : @xmath6 . as in @xcite",
    ", here we have an interesting case , where the model has a scale that produces a different macroscopic behavior , given by the heat equation with the following robin boundary condition : @xmath32    as we already observed , the model analysed in @xcite has some relations with our model , but while they consider a case where the rate of births and deaths in the vicinity of the boundary corresponds to our case @xmath6 , they obtain a dirichlet boundary condition , which is different of the robin boundary condition we have here .",
    "this is not a contradiction , because the models are different : in @xcite there is only entrance of particles in the right side of the boundary and leaving in the left side , while in ours we have both entrance and leaving in each side , but with different rates .    also ,",
    "the boundary condition in shows that the rate of mass transfer through each side of the boundary in our model depend only on what is happening in that side of the boundary .",
    "this is a different behavior when compared to the boundary condition obtained in the case @xmath26 for the slow bond ( see @xcite ) , where the boundary condition is @xmath33 .",
    "we stress the fact that in the slow bond model the two sides of the boundary are connected , which is not what happens in the case considered here",
    ".    there is another important difference between the slow bond and the slow boundary processes .",
    "this difference is that in the ssep with slow bond the bernoulli product measure is an invariant measure , but , here , for the ssep with slow boundary , the bernoulli product is only an invariant measure if @xmath34 . in the general case , @xmath35 , the invariant measure is given in @xcite .",
    "as one can think , in the proof of the hydrodynamic limit the main difficulty is in the characterization of the limit points , and this difficulty is caused by the boundary terms .",
    "we overcome this difficulty using replacement lemmas and energy estimates .",
    "however , as we already said , our model differs from the one considered in @xcite by the fact that in our model the invariant measure is not the bernoulli product measure .",
    "even if the bernoulli product measure is not an invariant measure in the general case ( @xmath36 ) , we use it to prove the replacement lemma and energy estimates .",
    "the use of another measure instead of the invariant measure has some cost , but fortunately this cost is small and vanishes in the limit . for the replacement lemma in the case @xmath5 , we need to be more careful when we take the bernoulli product with a slowly varying parameter as in the work @xcite .    in order to understand the behavior of these invariant measures",
    ", we look at the profile associated to them . this is what we mean by hydrostatic limit . even though @xcite gives a characterization for these measures ,",
    "we choose to follow a different way that does not rely on their explicit expression .",
    "as it is expected , the invariant measures are associated to the initial conditions of the hydrodynamic equations , which have solutions that are stationary in time .",
    "the unexpected case is @xmath37 , where the profile @xmath38\\to { \\mathbb{r}}$ ] is linear with @xmath39 and @xmath40 . here",
    ", it is possible to observe the influence that each side of the boundary creates .",
    "the case @xmath16 has been considered in @xcite , where the authors proved fluctuations for the model .",
    "we get , for @xmath41 , a profile limit which is equal to theirs : it is linear with @xmath42 and @xmath43 . if @xmath44 the profile is constant equal to @xmath45 .",
    "the present work is divided as follows . in section [ s2 ]",
    ", we introduce the notation and the main results . in section [ s3 ] , we prove the hydrostatic behavior stated in theorem [ t1 ] . the remaining of this paper is dedicated to the proof of theorem [ t2 ] . in section [ s4 ] ,",
    "we prove tightness for any range of the parameter @xmath4 . in section [ s5 ]",
    ", we prove the _ replacement lemma _ and we establish the energy estimates , which are fundamental steps towards the proof . in section",
    "[ s6 ] , we characterize the limit points as weak solutions of the corresponding partial differential equations . finally , uniqueness of weak solutions is refereed to section [ s7 ] .",
    "for any @xmath46 , let @xmath47 be a subset of @xmath48 with @xmath49 points .",
    "the sites ( points ) of @xmath50 will be denoted by @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , while the macroscopic variables ( points of the interval @xmath54 $ ] ) will be denoted by @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",

    "analogously , we have the same behavior in the right border ( site @xmath11 ) , with rate of leaving @xmath13 and rate of entering @xmath67 . the parameters @xmath68 and @xmath69 are fixed constants .",
