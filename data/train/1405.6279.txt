    "a neutron halo is one of the most attractive phenomena found in some unstable nuclei near the neutron dripline , and has attracted much attention since the discovery of the large matter radius of @xmath2li  @xcite .",
    "typical two neutron halo nuclei are , e.g. , @xmath3he",
    "@xcite , @xmath2li , @xmath4be  @xcite , and the recently observed @xmath5c  @xcite",
    ". a common feature of these nuclei is a small two - neutron separation energy ( @xmath6 ) that leads to a large matter radius .",
    "it is known that such weakly bound systems exhibit large @xmath0 strength at the low - energy region as often studied through coulomb breakup reactions  @xcite . as a unique phenomenon in the neutron rich nuclei ,",
    "the possibility of the sdm has for a long time been discussed as a vibration of the halo neutrons against the core  @xcite , which is a variant of the macroscopic picture of the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) such as goldhaber - teller  @xcite and steinwedel - jensen  @xcite models .",
    "these days low - lying @xmath0 strength in medium- and heavy - mass nuclei has been studied extensively in its relationship to neutron - skin thickness and neutron matter in a neutron star  @xcite .",
    "the low - lying strength is observed in neutron - proton unbalanced nuclei and it is often called a pygmy dipole resonance ( pdr ) because its strength is much smaller than that of the gdr . however , its excitation mechanism is still controversial concerning whether the mode is sdm , collective or single - particle excitation .    in this paper , we study the @xmath0 response of @xmath1he up to the gdr region , focusing on the possibility of the sdm as well as other @xmath0 excitation modes .",
    "the low - lying @xmath0 strength of @xmath3he was observed by the coulomb breakup experiment of @xmath3he  @xcite , which found a broad peak in the low - energy region just few mev above the @xmath7 threshold .",

    "figure  [ tdens.fig ] plots the proton and neutron transition densities of the most prominent peaks at about 3 , 7 , 18 , and 33mev . in the lowest prominent peak at 3.0 mev ,",
    "the transition densities of proton and neutron coincide up to about 1.7 fm , which corresponds to the peak of the ground state neutron density ( see fig .  [ dens.fig ] ) .",
    "the neutron transition density deviates from the proton one beyond 1.7 fm , showing in - phase oscillation in the interior region , @xmath155 fm , and out - of - phase oscillation in the external region @xmath156 fm .",
    "furthermore , the neutron transition density is very much extended beyond 10 fm .",
    "these observations agree with what we expect from the relationship  ( [ np.tr.density ] ) for an ideal sdm and are consistent with the classical interpretation of the sdm discussed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "as the energy increases up to 18 mev , the proton transition density gradually shrinks but its basic pattern is still kept .",
    "this shrinkage is due to the fact that the @xmath154 of the neutron transition density vibrates more and more rapidly with an increase of the number of nodes of oscillation .",
    "though the penetration of the valence neutrons into the internal region grows gradually , the internal structure characteristic of the sdm does not change so much as shown in figs .",
    "[ tdens.fig ] ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "the oscillatory behavior becomes even stronger at 17.7 mev , showing little distortion of the core .",
    "the neutron transition density reaches a maximum at 3.4 fm .",
    "the protons follow the motion of the neutrons , and the resulting proton transition density exhibits a destructive pattern .",
    "such neutron oscillation leads to the smaller @xmath0 strength than that of the lowest - lying peak .    at the higher peak with 33mev",
    ", the transition densities clearly show the out - of - phase oscillation in the whole region , which is typical of the gdr .",
    "the proton transition density shows somewhat broader distribution than those of the low - lying states .",
    "this suggests the strong distortion of the core due to the dipole field , which can never be described by @xmath7 three - body models with an inert core . as an example of the ideal gdr , we plot in fig .",
    "[ tdens4he.fig ] the transition densities of the most prominent strength of @xmath38he at 31.8 mev .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ e1disc4he.fig ] . both the proton and neutron transition densities show the identical distribution with opposite phases .",
    "they are peaked at 1.9 fm , which is further inside than those of the gdr of @xmath3he .",
    "we also investigate the excited modes of @xmath3he at about 40 mev and find that their transition densities are similar to that of the gdr but have more oscillations and smaller amplitudes .      to examine how good the three - body model of @xmath7 is for @xmath1he , we study the cluster sum rule  @xcite as a qualitative measure .",
    "we rewrite the @xmath0 operator ( [ e1.eq ] ) as @xmath157 if the system has a core plus two - nucleon structure , the first term on the right - hand side of the above equation does not contribute to the @xmath0 strength , which leads to the non - energy - weighted cluster sum rule  @xcite @xmath158 we calculate a cumulative sum of the @xmath0 strength , @xmath159 , and find that the cumulative sum exceeds the @xmath160 value of 5.44@xmath142@xmath26 at @xmath161mev .",
    "therefore the cluster sum rule occupies about 75% of the non - energy - weighted sum rule  ( [ newsr ] ) and its strength appears below the excitation energy of 25mev . since the gdr appears above 30mev , we conclude that the sdm and gdr are well separated and the low - lying strength is understood with the @xmath7 three - body structure .    the above conclusion is further confirmed by calculating the proton - proton rms distance , @xmath127 , of the state @xmath134 because @xmath127 can be a measure of whether or not the @xmath9 core exists in @xmath3he . by selecting those states that have 1/1000 of the @xmath0 sum rule value , we plot in fig .",
    "[ pp.fig ] the ratio of @xmath127 of @xmath3he to that of @xmath17he .",
    "the ratio is unity up to the excitation energy of about 20 mev that corresponds to the excitation energy of the first excited @xmath70 state of @xmath17he ( 20.21 mev  @xcite ) .",
    "this indicates that the core is not virtually excited , and thus the three - body picture holds very well in the low - energy region below 20 mev . as discussed in sec .",

    "no such core swelling effect is found , however , in the low - lying @xmath138 states . in the @xmath138 states the valence neutrons are further away from the core and receive essentially no interaction from the core . beyond the excitation energy of 20 mev , the ratio suddenly increases and reaches a maximum at the gdr region , indicating a large distortion of the core .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the two peak structure of the @xmath0 strength function of @xmath1he is discussed from the isospin decomposition to @xmath39 and 2 states .",
    "the low - lying peak is dominated by the total isospin @xmath39 state , and above @xmath16220 mev the @xmath163 component contributes as well .",

    "the core excitation often plays an important role in enhancing the low - lying @xmath0 strength of two - neutron halo nuclei .",

    "the large enhancement of the low - lying @xmath0 transition in the two - neutron halo nuclei is mainly due to the weak binding feature of the valence nucleons , but a special care about the structure of the core is needed for understanding its origin .",
    "we examine another @xmath0 mode , the so - called compressional @xmath0 ( @xmath170 ) mode  @xcite .",
    "the operator for the mode is defined as @xmath171 according to a simple harmonic - oscillator shell model , the @xmath170 mode appears at the high - energy region because it requires at least 3@xmath172 excitations from the @xmath173 ground state .",
    "however , if the ground state contains some amount of correlated components , the mode may appear at the low - energy region by coupling with higher oscillator shells that are already incorporated in the ground state wave function .",
    "the matrix element of @xmath174 is given by the proton transition density as @xmath175 the matrix element for the isoscalar ( is ) compressional dipole ( @xmath176 ) mode is calculated as @xmath177 since the transition is not necessarily induced by the electromagnetic interaction but the nuclear one , we omit @xmath24 from the matrix element .",
    "figure  [ compe1.fig ] displays the @xmath170 strengths as a function of the excitation energy .",
    "similarly to the normal @xmath0 operator , two peak structure is found but the low - lying peaks are more concentrated and enhanced .",
    "the sdm is more characterized by the @xmath170 mode rather than the @xmath0 one by the additional @xmath178 factor of the operator . as eq .",

    "it is found that the @xmath0 non - energy - weighted sum rule is fully accounted for by our model space .",
    "the @xmath0 strength function exhibits two - peak structure at around 3 and 33 mev excitation energy .",
    "the lower peak is well understood in the framework of the @xmath7 structure and its excitation mechanism is consistent with the classical interpretation of the soft dipole mode ( sdm ) , in which in - phase proton - neutron oscillation occurs in the internal region whereas out - of - phase oscillation occurs in the surface region . beyond the surface region",
