    "the @xmath2 meson showing up as a broad resonant intermediate state in reactions in which two pions are involved @xcite may be understood as a @xmath20 , @xmath21 core state in a confining potential , coupled to a @xmath22 di - pion state in the continuum , where the two pions are in a relative @xmath23-state with isospin @xmath24 .",
    "this coupling lowers the average mass as compared to the confined core state and leads to a broad mass distribution .",
    "this dual aspect of the @xmath2 meson leads to two different predictions for the @xmath0-channel contribution , @xmath1 , of the difference of the electric and magnetic polarizability of the nucleon which have been shown @xcite to agree with each other and with the experimental result . in the present work",

    "the @xmath25-channel d.o.f . are those degrees of freedom of the nucleon which also show up in photoabsorption experiments on the nucleon .",

    "the result is @xmath162 mev . in the second case @xcite the bosonized version of the njl model",
    "is applied and the regularization scheme makes use of dimensional scaling , _",
    "i.e. _ no cut - off parameter @xmath64 is present so that the integrals extends to infinity . instead ,",
    "use is made of the fact that the difference of the diverging integrals for the constituent - quark mass @xmath142 and the pion decay constant @xmath17 is finite .",
    "the result is @xmath97 mev .",
    "it is remarkable and has not been pointed out before that these two completely different treatments of the njl model perfectly lead to the same result .",
    "this gives us confidence that conclusions based on this number for the @xmath2 meson mass are on a sound basis . in case of the two - photon decay width @xmath161 the njl model is used to justify the neglect of couplings of the @xmath2 meson to two photons via meson loops .",
    "such additional couplings follow from the l@xmath2 m .",
    "if taken into account the additional couplings would partly destroy the good agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "therefore , the argument delivered by the njl model is important .",
    "a further new results obtained is the calculation of the two - photon decay width @xmath161 of the @xmath85 meson .",
    "this calculation is based on a @xmath163 structure of the @xmath85 meson and leads to agreement with experimental results .",
    "we consider this as an argument that indeed the @xmath85 meson and the @xmath2 meson have a @xmath8 core and not a @xmath164 structure as suggested in other approaches @xcite .",
    "this result is important for the present investigation as well as for the physics of scalar mesons in general .",
    "in addition , for the first time the contribution of the @xmath85 meson to @xmath1 has been calculated . a further new result are arguments in favor of positive decay amplitudes @xmath165 and @xmath166 which formerly were believed to be negative .    via the two representations of @xmath1 a quantitative link",
    "is obtained between the @xmath2 meson as the particle of the @xmath2 field and the @xmath2 meson as showing up as an extremely shortlived intermediate state in reactions where two pions are involved .",
    "this observation may be exploited to get insight into the structure of the @xmath2 meson by constructing a model which makes the relation between the graphs b ) and c ) in figure [ poleandcutgraphs ] transparent .",
