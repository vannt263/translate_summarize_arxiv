    "despite large observational , theoretical and numerical efforts over decades , supernovae explosions are not fully understood .",
    "standard stellar evolution theory predicts that stars with initial mass @xmath0 end their short life in core - collapse supernovae explosions , while long - lived stars of mass less than @xmath1 eject most of their outer layers , leaving a @xmath2 carbon oxygen ( c - o ) white dwarf ( wd ) that cools slowly by radiation , possibly for billions of years . if such a c - o white dwarf accretes mass from a companion star and crosses the chandrasekhar mass limit , @xmath3 ( chandrasekhar  1931 ) , at which the pressure of its degenerate electron gas can no longer balance the gravitational pressure , it undergoes a gravitational collapse .",
    "its temperature rises sharply and triggers a runaway thermonuclear explosion ( hoyle and fowler 1960 ) where no central object is left over , most of the nuclear binding energy release is converted to kinetic energy of the debris of a supernova ( sn ) type ia , while its observed bolometric light - curve is powered mainly by the decay of the long - lived end - product radioactive elements that were synthesized in the explosion .",
    "as the progenitors of core - collapse sne are much more luminous than wds , they have been identified from archival images on multiple occasions smartt 2009 , while there have not yet been any direct observations of the wd progenitor of an sn ia . however , the above paradigm of the origin of sne ia is strongly supported by several observational facts ( see , e.g. , astier 2012 and references therein ) such as :    * sne ia are the only type of sne observed in old stellar environments such as elliptical galaxies .",
    "wd are produced by long - lived stars of less than @xmath1 that eject most of their outer layers , leaving a @xmath2 c - o wd that cools slowly by radiation , for billions of years . * the fast exothermic nuclear fusion reactions , starting with helium capture by @xmath4c and @xmath5o ,",

    "the fast exothermic nuclear fusion reactions end with the near center production of @xmath6ni whose radioactive decay chain @xmath7 seems to power the light - curves and explain the late appearance of iron group elements spectral lines . * the kinetic energy of the debris , the bolometric light - curve , the spectrum and the spectral evolution of sne ia",
    "are roughly those expected .",
    "many impressive hydrodynamical codes with radiation transport that calculate the light - curves and spectra of sne have been developed in the past two decades .",
    "such codes require as an input the initial distribution of density , chemical composition , velocity , temperature and angular momentum in the sn ejecta .",
    "these , in principle should have been provided by the numerical simulation of the initial explosion .",
    "however , so far such explosion codes starting with configurations obtained from standard stellar evolution calculations have not been able to produce consistently supernovae explosions of any type .",
    "nevertheless , it is widely believed that such elaborate codes are necessary in order to reproduce the light - curves and spectra of sne of all types during their photospheric and early nebular phases ( see , e.g. , frey et al .",
    "2012 and references therein ) .",
    "this is because of the enormous complexity of sn explosions and the large diversity of their light - curves , complex spectra and spectral evolution .    despite the complexity of sn explosions , sne ia light - curves and spectra display an approximate standard candle behaviour ( see , e.g. , branch & tammann1992 ) with simple correlations between various photometric properties such as peak luminosity , color and decline rate following peak luminosity ( e.g. , phillips  1993 ; riess et al .",
    "1996 ; tripp  1998 ) .",
    "these correlations were used to standardize sne ia and have allowed to improve the precision of cosmic distances estimated from sne ia observations that led to the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe ( riess et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al .  1999 ) .",
    "the nearly standard properties of sne ia , however , suggest that perhaps the bolometric light - curves and other general properties of sne ia can be derived directly from a simple model , despite the complexity of sne ia explosions and the details of the complex radiation transport in the ejecta .",
    "semi - analytic approaches have been pioneered by colgate and mckee  ( 1969 ) , arnett  ( 1979 ) , and colgate , petschek and kriese  ( 1980 ) . improved analytic solutions for the conversion of radioactive decay energy into the light - curves of sne ia",
    "have been proposed more recently , e.g. , by pinto and eastman  ( 2000 ) . here",
    ", using an even simpler analytical model , we derive the main standard properties of sne ia during their photospheric phase .",
    "in particular , we derive simple closed form expressions that well describe their bolometric and photometric light - curves during their photospheric and early nebular phases . in a following paper",
    "we extend that to the main types of core - collapse sne , sne iip , sne iil , sne ib / c , super luminous sne of types i and ii ( see , e.g. , gal - yam  2012 and references therein for the current classification of sne ) , which are powered mainly by the radioactive decay of @xmath6ni and/or by the interaction of their ejecta with their environments .",
    "we adopt the current paradigm of sne ia explosions , where a carbon - oxygen ( c - o ) white dwarf accretes mass from a companion until it reaches a critical mass @xmath8 ( @xmath9 , the chandrasekhar mass limit ) and undergoes a gravitational collapse that rapidly raises its temperature and triggers thermonuclear reactions that produce intermediate mass elements ( ime = si , ca , s , ... ) via deflagration ( nomoto et al .",
    "1976 , 1984 ) followed by a transition to detonation that converts a fraction @xmath10 of them to @xmath11 whose decay chain powers the bolometric light - curves of sne ia ( colgate & mckee1969 ; colgate et al .  1980 ; kuchner et al .  1994 ) .",
    "this fraction @xmath10 probably depends on the unknown initial conditions ( such as distributions of mass , composition and angular momentum in the wd progenitor when its mass crosses @xmath8 ) , and will be treated as a free adjustable parameter .",
    "we assume spherical symmetry and ignore environmental effects produced , e.g. , by a companion star or a common envelope .    *",
    "( a ) the kinetic energy of the explosion : * the nuclear binding energy release per nucleon in the explosion when a c / o nucleus is synthesized into ime is @xmath12 mev or @xmath13 mev if the c - o is synthesized into @xmath6ni .",
    "a negligible fraction of these energies escapes through photons and neutrinos and most of it is converted to the kinetic energy of the explosion .",
    "morover , when the mass of an accreting wd crosses @xmath8 , the sum of the gravitational binding energy and free energy of the degenerate electron gas is @xmath14 , independent of radius .",
    "consequently , the kinetic energy @xmath15 of the explosion at @xmath16 is approximately the nuclear binding energy released in the synthesis of ime and @xmath6ni , @xmath17\\ , { \\rm mev}\\ ,       \\label{ek}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the baryon number of the c - o wd progenitor . for @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 ergs .    *",
    "( b ) the expansion velocity : * we neglect angular momentum and enviromental effects and assume an homologous expansion of the sn fireball , i.e. , a uniform spatial density throughout the fireball at any moment .",
    "this implies that the expansion velocity @xmath22 at distance @xmath23 from the center satisfies @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the radius of the fireball and @xmath26 is its expansion rate at @xmath25 .",
    "consequently , the total kinetic energy of the explosion is @xmath27 . substituting that into eq .",
    "( 1 ) yields @xmath28 where the effective mass of a baryon in @xmath29ca and @xmath6ni is @xmath30 . hence , the expected initial expansion velocity is roughly @xmath31 km / s _ independent of the value of @xmath8_. because of the typical low density of the surrounding medium where sne ia explosions take place , the deceleration of the expansion due to swept - in mass is negligible during the photospheric and early nebular phases , unless the explosion takes place inside a common envelope of a close binary . note that as long as the sn fireball is opaque to its black body radiation , the observed photospheric velocity @xmath32 is roughly the expansion velocity at a depth where the optical opacity satisfies @xmath33 , i.e. , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the optical depth to the center of the fireball .    * ( c ) the bolometric luminosity : * let @xmath36 be the time of shock break - out .",
    "the typical environment of sne ia has too low a density to slow down the expansion of the sn fireball .",
    "consequently , for @xmath37 the radius @xmath25 of the sn fireball expands homologously with practically a constant @xmath38 .",
    "the bolometric light - curves of sne ia are powered by trapping the energy of the gamma rays and positrons from the radioactive decay chain @xmath39 near the center . throughout the photospheric phase ,",
    "the sn fireball is highly opaque to radiation and the energy input is mainly through compton scattering of the gamma - rays .",
    "the thermal energy density @xmath40 is dominated by black body radiation , i.e. , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 , and the total thermal energy of the sn fireball is @xmath43 . during the photospheric phase , the sn fireball loses energy mainly by expansion , at a rate @xmath44 ( for a constant @xmath26 ) , and by emission of photons , which are transported to the surface by a random walk .",
    "the photon emission yields a bolometric luminosity @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the mean diffusion time of photons to the surface by a random walk , @xmath47 is their mean free path and @xmath48 is the fireball opacity where the summation extends over all particles in the fireball ( ions , neutral atoms and free electrons ) with density @xmath49 and effective cross section @xmath50 .",
    "roughly @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
