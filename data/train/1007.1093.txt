    "the current method for detecting infall in pre - stellar cores and young stellar objects ( ysos ) involves observing an optically thick line , such as cs j=2@xmath11 and 3@xmath12 , along with an optically thin line , such as n@xmath2h@xmath0 j=1@xmath10 ( both of which are tracers of dense gas ) towards the selected core ( lee et al .",
    "if the optically thick lines exhibit a double peaked profile , with the blue - shifted peak stronger than the red - shifted peak ( i.e. a _ blue asymmetry _ ) , and the optically thin line is single peaked with a central velocity that lies inbetween the two peaks of the optically thick transition ( to verify that the double peak does not arise from two separate dense clouds along the line of sight ) , then it is a strong , but not unambiguous , indicator that the core is collapsing .",
    "the blue asymmetry is not unique to a particular collapse model ( leung & brown 1977 ) , although many astronomers interpret their observations of both spectral line and continuum emission by comparison with the inside - out collapse model of shu ( 1977 ) ( e.g. zhou et al 1993 ; motte & andre 2001 ) . the inside - out collapse model is also widely used in theoretical studies of collapsing cores ( e.g. tsamis et al . 2008 ; rawlings & yates 2001 ; rawlings et al .",
    "1992 ; evans et al .",
    "1994 ; weidenschilling et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "however , there are several theoretical arguments and observational studies which indicate that the inside - out collapse model may be inappropriate .",
    "for example , @xcite found that the class 0 protostar iram 04191 shows evidence of extended inward motions , which are inconsistent with the model of shu ( 1977 ) , which predicts that the outer parts of the core should be static .",
    "the inside - out collapse model of @xcite describes the protostellar phase , and begins from a singular isothermal sphere .",
    "preceding this is the pre - protostellar phase ( often referred to as the pre - stellar phase for breivity ; @xcite ) .",
    "it has been suggested that during this time a diffuse core evolves quasi - statically into a more centrally condensed pre - stellar core via the process of ambipolar diffusion . in this paper , we model the line profiles of various transitions of the commonly used infall tracers cs and hco@xmath0 produced by two different models of collapsing cores : ( i ) a new ambipolar diffusion model ( stace & rawlings 2010 , in preparation ; hereafter sr10 ) and ( ii ) the standard inside - out collapse model ( shu 1977 ) .",
    "the ambipolar diffusion model covers the pre - stellar phase , but by @xmath3  yr it extends into conditions similar to the protostellar regime , reaching a density of @xmath4  @xmath5 at a distance of @xmath6  cm ( @xmath7au ) from the core centre , which is actually higher than that estimated for the protostellar core iram 04191 at such a distance @xcite at this time , one of the main differences between these two models is that the inside - out collapse model has a static envelope , whereas in the ambipolar diffusion model there are extended low - velocity inward motions .",
    "an important aspect of this work is that we couple the dynamical models to a large chemical network , in order to predict more accurate abundance profiles of each molecule .",
    "these abundance profiles are then used as an input to a radiative transfer model , along with the density and velocity profiles appropriate for each collapse model .",
    "we focus on how the chemical evolution of the cores affects the resulting line profiles shapes , and we find that the chemical distribution can be an important factor in determining whether or not the blue - asymmetry is seen .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ models ]",
    "we describe dynamical collapse models studied in the paper , and in section  [ sec : chemmod ] we describe the chemical model , the results of which are given in section  [ chemdisc ] . in section  [ glp ]",
    "we describe the radiative transfer model used and how the line profiles were generated , and in section  [ rad ] we present the resulting line profiles , and also discuss their sensitivity to the temperature profile of the cores . in section  [ collapse_disc ]",
    "we present a discussion of the results , considering their sensitivity to the conditions chosen in the chemical model .",
    "the conclusions are summarised in section  [ conc ] .",
    "ambipolar diffusion controlled collapse occurs in magnetically subcritical cores , where the magnetic field is strong enough to support the core against gravitational collapse .",
    "it is estimated that a core is subcritical if the core mass to magnetic flux ratio , @xmath8 , is less than @xmath9 ( in cgs units ) , where @xmath10 is the gravitational constant ( mouschovias & spitzer 1976 ) . in such cores",
    ", the neutral species do not directly feel the effect of the magnetic field , and therefore drift towards the centre of core , being impeded by the drag force exerted by the ions which are tied to the magnetic field .",
    "eventually , in the centre of the core , enough mass builds up so that the core becomes supercritical and begins to collapse on a dynamical timescale .",
    "we have taken preliminary results from the dynamical model from sr10 to couple with our chemical model .",
    "the model will be described in detail in sr10 , but the following is a brief summary :    the dynamical model follows the spherically symmetric collapse of a core composed of 100 concentric shells of gas and dust .",
    "the core is embedded in a cylindrical magnetic field , which evolves throughout the collapse , although its geometry always remains cylindrical .",
    "there is no mass transfer between the shells .    at each time step",
    ", the code calculates the total force exerted on each shell of gas , taking into account the gravitational force , the gas pressure and the drag force exerted on the neutral species by the ions and charged dust grains .",
    "these drag forces depend on the number density of charged particles , and on the drift velocity between ions and neutrals , which is related to the magnetic field strength . to calculate the magnetic field at each step",
    ", it is assumed that the magnetic field is frozen into the plasma .",
    "the code also calculates the visual extinction for each shell , which increases during the collapse due to the increase in the density of dust grains . a relationship between visual extinction and temperature is assumed , so the radial temperature profile also evolves throughout the collapse , which affects the gas pressure . the temperatures in the core ranges from 6.5  k to 13.5  k , although since in our chemical model it is not yet possible to include a time dependent chemistry , we have assumed a constant gas temperature of 10  k. the chemical abundances are not significantly affected by this simplification ; running the chemical model at temperatures of 6.5  k and 13.5  k results in differences in the cs and hco@xmath0 abundances of @xmath11% .",
    "in the model of sr10 , account is taken of how the changing chemical composition of the core affects the collapse dynamics ; chemical reactions and freeze - out of ions onto dust grains affect the overall ionisation fraction of the gas , which therefore alters the drag force experienced by the neutrals .",
    "the rates of the chemical reactions depend on the density , visual extinction and temperature calculated by the dynamical equations . sr10 have coupled the chemical and dynamical equations to build a self - consistent model of ambipolar diffusion controlled collapse .",
    "we have used the results for a core of mass 6.80  @xmath12 , radius @xmath13  cm and magnetic field strength 4 @xmath14 g , leading to a mass to flux ratio of @xmath15  g  g@xmath16  @xmath17 .",
    "this is @xmath18 times the critical value calculated by @xcite , consistent with observations of molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "although this is a ` supercritical ' core according to the @xcite criterium , the magnetic field is still strong enough to significantly retard the collapse .",
    "the initial density distribution of the core is uniform , with @xmath19  @xmath5 .",
    "the data we have taken from this model are : ( i ) radius as a function of time , and ( ii ) density and velocity as a function of time and radius , for the set of 100 infalling shells making up a collapsing core .",
    "we run chemical models for six of these shells , spanning the entire core radius .",
    "we derive the chemical evolution of the shells with starting radii of @xmath13  cm , @xmath20  cm , @xmath21  cm , @xmath22  cm , @xmath23  cm and @xmath24  cm respectively .",
    ".table showing the initial radius ( @xmath25 ) and density ( @xmath26 ) for each collapsing shell for which we derive the chemical evolution , for the ambipolar diffusion and inside - out collapse models .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ bluepeaks3 ]",
    "it has been demonstrated in the previous section that the abundance profile of the molecules across the core ( in particular whether or not there is depletion ) can have a significant impact upon the line profiles .",
    "we therefore first discuss the sensitivity of the models to different chemical conditions .      we have assumed that , in each of our models , the core begins its collapse from atomic initial conditions ( apart from hydrogen which is initially 90% molecular ) .",
    "this , however , might not be accurate , especially for the inside - out collapse model which starts from a more evolved state .",
    "this has been recognised in previous studies .",
    "for example , rawlings et al .",
    "( 1992 ) assume that the core is initially at a uniform density of @xmath27  @xmath5 , with the initial abundances taken from a previous model by @xcite , and then allow modified free - fall collapse to the isothermal sphere configuration , where the inside - out collapse eventually begins . in rawlings & yates ( 2001 ) , they also consider the possibility that once the core has reached the isothermal sphere state , it can remain in pressure - balanced equilibrium prior to the inside - out collapse .",
    "it is debatable what the initial abundances for such collapse models should be , since the pre - stellar core lifetime is not yet well determined @xcite .",
    "we have therefore investigated the effect on the line profiles for both models of keeping the core static for a period of time , @xmath28 , ranging from @xmath29 to @xmath30  yr , allowing the chemistry to reach a more evolved state before the collapse is initiated .",
    "the drawback of this investigation for the inside - out collapse model is that it may be unrealistic that a core would be static in the isothermal sphere configuration preceding the onset of the cew .",
    "instead , it is more likely that it is contracting from lower densities , and therefore the chemical timescales could be longer than those presented here .    , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 for the ambipolar diffusion model at @xmath33 yr ( solid line ) , @xmath34 yr ( dotted line ) and @xmath35 yr ( dashed line ) . in this model",
    "the core has been static for @xmath36  yr before it begins collapsing.,width=340 ]     for transitions @xmath37 and @xmath38 for the ambipolar diffusion model at @xmath33 yr ( solid line ) , @xmath34 yr ( dotted line ) and @xmath35 yr ( dashed line ) . in this model",
    "the core has been static for @xmath39  yr before it begins collapsing.,width=340 ]    for the ambipolar diffusion model , we find that there is no effect on the line profiles presented in figure  [ all_ad ] for @xmath40  yr . for @xmath36",
    "yr , there is an effect on the cs line profiles , shown in figure  [ cs_1e5 ] . in figure",
    "[ all_ad ] , the peak intensities of the cs(@xmath41 ) and ( @xmath42 ) lines increase as the core evolves from @xmath43  yr to @xmath44  yr , but for @xmath36  yr we find that those lines reach their maximum peak intensity at @xmath43  yr , and then they decrease by @xmath44  yr .",
    "this is because for @xmath45 , cs reaches its peak abundance between @xmath46  yr ( for the inner shell ) and @xmath47  yr ( for the outer shell ) , but for @xmath36  yr , the peak abundance is reached at slightly earlier times of @xmath48 to @xmath49  yr .",
    "therefore for @xmath36  yr , by a collapse time of @xmath44  yr , the cs abundance in all shells is already past its peak , resulting in a lower abundance across the core compared to @xmath45 .    for @xmath50",
    "yr , cs is severely depleted , so the peak intensities are very much reduced .",
    "for @xmath51  yr , cs becomes undetectable .    for hco@xmath0 ,",
    "the line profiles are not affected until @xmath52  yr . for this @xmath28 ,",
    "the initial hco@xmath0 abundance for the collapse stage is very high ( @xmath53 compared to @xmath54 for @xmath45 ) , resulting in much higher peak intensities for the earlier collapse times ( @xmath55 and @xmath43  yr ) , compared to those with @xmath45 .    for @xmath39  yr ,",
    "shown in figure  [ hcop_1e7 ] , the initial abundance of hco@xmath0 is even higher ( @xmath56 ) , and line intensities increase even further compared to @xmath45 .    by @xmath57",
    "yr , however , hco@xmath0 begins to deplete before the collapse begins ( the initial hco@xmath0 abundance for the collapse stage is now only @xmath58 ) , and the line intensities decrease compared to @xmath39  yr .",
    "for transitions @xmath37 and @xmath38 for the inside - out model at @xmath59 yr ( solid line ) , @xmath60 yr ( dotted line ) , @xmath33 yr ( dashed line ) and @xmath61 yr ( dot - dashed line ) . in this model",
    "the core has been static for @xmath36  yr before it begins collapsing . ,",
    "width=340 ]    for the inside - out collapse model , there is no effect on the cs or hco@xmath0 line profiles until @xmath36  yr . for this @xmath28 ,",
    "even for a collapse time of @xmath62  yr , the cs becomes severely depleted in the inner shells ( for the three innermost shells the abundances of cs are @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 for @xmath36  yr , compared to @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 for @xmath45 ) .",
    "this results in large decrease in the line intensity during the collapse for all the cs lines considered .",
    "this effect is particularly severe for the cs(@xmath69 ) which traces the innermost parts of the shell ; for a collapse time of @xmath62  yr the line intensity reduces from 1.2 for @xmath45 to 0.12 for @xmath36  yr .    for hco@xmath0 , for @xmath36 ( plotted in figure  [ hcop_cew_1e5 ] ) , at all times during the collapse the abundances in the outer parts of the core are greater than the abundance in the same shells for @xmath45 .",
    "however , at this @xmath28 , the inner shells are more depleted .",
    "because of this , for @xmath36  yr , the hco@xmath0(@xmath41 ) lines ( which trace the inner parts of the core ) have lower peak intensities than for @xmath45 , and the hco@xmath0(@xmath70 ) lines ( which trace the lower density outer material ) , show higher peak intensities for @xmath36  yr .    by @xmath52",
    "yr , the cs lines have practically disappeared because of depletion , and even the hco@xmath0(@xmath70 ) lines start decreasing in intensity as the hco@xmath0 depletion starts to affect larger radii .    as with the ambipolar diffusion model , keeping the core static for a period of time affects the cs and hco@xmath0 lines differently . for both models , including a static period tends to weaken the cs lines due to depletion , but for moderate values of @xmath28 ( @xmath3  yr for the ambipolar diffusion model and @xmath71  yr for the inside - out collapse model ) , the hco@xmath0 intensities can increase .",
    "this is because , as explained in section  [ chemdisc ] , hco@xmath0 is a ` depletion enhanced ' molecule .",
    "the cs : hco@xmath0 intensity ratios could therefore be a useful indicator of the initial state of chemical evolution of a collapsing core .",
    "the inside - out collapse model results indicate that for cs to be detectable during the collapse phase , the core can not have been static with the isothermal sphere density configuration for more than @xmath44  yr .      in our models we have assumed that the cores are sufficiently embedded within a larger molecular cloud such that the visual extinction at the edge of the envelope is @xmath72  magnitudes , practically suppressing all of the direct photoreactions .",
    "it is possible , however , that photoreactions play a more significant role in the chemistry , particularly at larger radii where the material is less shielded .",
    "this is particularly likely in cases where the parent molecular cloud has been dispersed ( eg . the pre - stellar core b68 @xcite and the class 0 object b335 @xcite ) .    to test the importance of these effects we have re - run our chemical model for the shells at the outer edges of the envelopes for both collapse models .",
    "we find that , for @xmath73  mag , the abundances of cs and hco@xmath0 are significantly reduced . for cs",
    ", this is because it is directly destroyed by photons .",
    "the higher ionisation level suppresses hco@xmath0 through dissociative recombination .",
    "these effects lead to reduced molecular abundances in the outer parts of the core , resulting in steeper gradients in the abundance profiles , and thus changing the line profile shapes .",
    "for example , in the ambipolar diffusion model , we suggested that the blue asymmetries in cs and hco@xmath0 lines are caused by the redshifted material at the front of the envelope preferentially absorbing the red emission from further inside the cloud .",
    "if there was less material in the outer envelope there would be less absorption , and we therefore expect a less pronounced blue asymmetry .",
    "in section  [ adcoll ] we mentioned that the ionisation fraction predicted by our chemical model is @xmath74 times less than the ionisation fraction predicted by the model of sr10 at late times ( @xmath44  yr ) , for large radii ( @xmath75  cm ) . since the dynamics of sr10 s model , which we used as an input to our chemical model , depend on the ionisation fraction , it is possible that , to be consistent with our chemical model , the outer parts of the core ( @xmath76  cm ) should be less strongly coupled to the magnetic field and could therefore have larger infall velocities .    to understand what effect this would have ,",
    "we have recalculated the cs line profiles for a collapse time of @xmath44  yr , but doubled the infall velocity for @xmath76  cm .",
    "we find that even for such high infall velocities in the outer parts of the core , the blue - shifted peak of the cs line profiles is almost completely unaffected .",
    "the red - shifted peaks , on the other hand , show a decrease in peak intensity , and for the cs(@xmath42 ) line the red - shifted peak is shifted further to the right ; in the original spectrum the peak intensity is 0.51  k at 0.26  km  s@xmath16 , but with the increased velocities in the outer core , the peak intensity decreases to 0.26  k at 0.31  km  s@xmath16 .",
    "this is the expected behaviour , since the higher velocity red - shifted material at the front of the core ( i.e. closest to the observer ) is now more strongly radiatively coupled with the red - shifted high velocity material in the core centre , and therefore can absorb more of the red - shifted emission from the core centre .",
    "note also that in this ` high - velocity ' model , the infall velocities are similar to those of @xcite ( @xmath77  km  s@xmath16 ) , and the blue - to - red peak intensity ratios for the cs(@xmath42 ) line predicted by both models are now in very good agreement with each other ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "in this paper we have modelled and compared the line profiles of several transitions of cs and hco@xmath0 at various times for cores undergoing ( a ) ambipolar diffusion regulated collapse and ( b ) inside - out collapse . rather than assuming a constant abundance for each molecule , we have coupled a chemical model to the dynamical models to try to generate realistic , time dependent abundance profiles , which are then used as an input to the radiative transfer code to calculate the line profiles .",
    "we have found four important conclusions :    1 .   for the inside - out collapse model to exhibit the blue asymmetry it is necessary to suppress freeze - out _ and _",
    "impose a negative temperature gradient on the core , whereas the ambipolar diffusion model exhibits the blue asymmetry even when there is significant freeze - out , and for all the kinetic temperature profiles tested .",
    "this conclusion is important because , for example , cs has been observed to be significantly depleted within dense cores ( e.g. bergin et al .",
    "2001 ; pagani et al . 2005 ) , and yet exhibits the blue asymmetric line profile ( e.g. mardones et al . , 1997 ; lee et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "zhou et al ( 1993 ) found that their observations of cs in b335 were very well fitted by the inside - out collapse model , but in these studies the cs abundance was assumed to be constant across the core .",
    "given the strong evidence for depletion of cs in such cores , it may be worth investigating in more detail the cs abundance profile in this core using interferometric observations , and seeing if the inside - out model is still able to reproduce the cs observations with a realistic abundance profile .",
    "note that belloche et al .",
    "( 2002 ) also found that the inside - out collapse model could not reproduce the blue asymmetry observed towards the class 0 protostar iram 04191 unless the collapse expansion wave radius is very large ( @xmath78 10 000 au ) , but then this resulted in very high velocities at small radii , giving rise to excessively large linewidths .",
    "they estimated that cs is depleted by a factor of @xmath79 in the centre of this core . since they took into account this depletion in their radiative transfer model , this could explain why their inside - out collapse model failed to reproduce the observations .",
    "the fact that a negative kinetic temperature gradient is required in the inside - out collapse model but not in the ambipolar diffusion model is due to the different line formation processes : in the ambipolar diffusion model the blue asymmetry arises because the foreground absorbing material is also infalling and redshifted , but for the inside - out collapse model it is because the blue emission originates from the central regions of the core where the excitation temperature is relatively high , whereas the red emission originates from further away from the centre where there is relatively lower excitation temperature .",
    "there are marked differences between the two models in the line strengths , asymmetries and time - dependencies of the line profiles .",
    "for the ambipolar diffusion model , the cs(@xmath42 ) and ( @xmath41 ) line profiles are strong and demonstrate a blue asymmetry ( with an absorption trough that is not at zero velocity ) .",
    "the cs(@xmath69 ) line is not detectable .",
    "the hco@xmath0(@xmath41 ) line is only detectable after @xmath80 years , whilst the ( @xmath70 ) line strength strongly increases with time . for the inside - out model ,",
    "all three cs lines are strong from the earliest stages , but decline with time .",
    "the hco@xmath0(@xmath70 ) line is also strong at all times , but the strength of the ( @xmath41 ) line steadily declines .",
    "thus , subject to caveats about possible degeneracies , these various characteristics may be useful in determining the dynamical structure and evolutionary status of low - mass infall regions .",
    "the initial molecular abundances in collapsing cores affect the evolution of the line profiles .",
    "in particular , if the core is held static for a period of time before the collapse , the peak intensity ratio between the cs and hco@xmath0 lines can be strongly affected .",
    "this is a major source of uncertainty in the theoretical interpretation of observed line profiles .",
    "this work demonstrates that the inside - out collapse model of @xcite , often referred to as the ` standard ' infall model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , has difficulty reproducing the blue asymmetry in the line profiles when the chemical evolution of the core is taken into account , due to depletion in the core centre and a lack of extended inward motions .",
    "the ambipolar diffusion model does not suffer from this problem , because even when the core has reached an advanced , centrally condensed state , there are still extended inward motions .    before using line profiles as diagnostics of a particular collapse model ,",
    "it is essential to investigate the abundance profile of the tracer molecule , in particular to see if there is any evidence for depletion .",

    "<S> we have coupled a chemical model with two dynamical models of collapsing low mass star - forming cores to predict abundances across the core of the commonly used infall tracers , cs and hco@xmath0 , at various stages of the collapse . </S>",
    "<S> the models investigated are a new ambipolar diffusion model and the ` inside - out ' collapse model . </S>",
    "<S> we have then used these results as an input to a radiative transfer model to predict the line profiles of several transitions of these molecules . for the inside - out collapse model , </S>",
    "<S> we predict significant molecular depletion due to freeze - out in the core centre , which prevents the formation of the blue asymmetry ( believed to be the ` signature ' of infall ) in the line profiles . </S>",
    "<S> molecular depletion also occurs in the ambipolar diffusion model during the late stages of collapse , but the line profiles still exhibit a strong blue asymmetry due to extended infall . for the inside - out collapse model to exhibit the blue asymmetry it is necessary to impose a negative kinetic temperature gradient on the core and </S>",
    "<S> suppress freeze - out . since freeze - out </S>",
    "<S> is observed in several class 0 protostars which are thought to be collapsing , this presents a major inconsistency in the inside - out collapse model of star formation .    </S>",
