    "new large - scale chandra data on the core of the perseus cluster , a426 , are presented here .",
    "they follow our earlier 900  ks acis - s image which covered a 8x8 arcmin region centred on the nucleus of the dominant galaxy ngc1275 ( fabian et al 2000 ; fabian et al 2006 ; sanders & fabian 2007 ) .",
    "that image , with hints from neighbouring ccd chips , indicated that bubbles , filaments and other fine - scale structure extended over a wider field .",
    "the new data extend the area imaged in detail to a region over 30  arcmin by 15  arcmin .",
    "xmm observations of the perseus cluster , of lower spatial resolution but covering an even wider area than that discussed here , have been presented and discussed by churazov et al ( 2003 ) .",
    "the perseus cluster is the x - ray brightest cluster in the sky ( forman et al 1973 ) , having peaked emission first resolved with the copernicus satellite ( fabian et al 1974 ) .",
    "einstein x - ray imaging showed a dip in the x - ray emission to the nw of the nucleus of the central galaxy , ngc1275 , ( branduardi - raymont et al 1981 ; fabian et al 1981 ) .",
    "rosat hri data ( bhringer et al 1993 ) showed that this dip was an outer bubble in the hot x - ray emitting gas and resolved two inner bubbles coincident with the fri radio source , 3c84 ( pedlar et al 1990 ) .",
    "churazov et al ( 2000 ) showed that the bubbles are inflated by the radio jets and rise buoyantly in the surrounding hot gas .",
    "the nw bubble was formed a few @xmath1 ago and is now moving outward .",
    "estimates of the likely energies and timescales indicated the power in the bubbling process to be of the order of @xmath2 .",
    "chandra images resolve the bubbles in detail ( fabian et al 2000 ) and show subtle ripples centred on the inner bubbles which are interpreted as weak shocks or sound waves produced by the bubbles ( fabian et al 2003a ) .",
    "the shape of the nw bubble resembles the cross - section of a rising spherical cap bubble in water on earth ( fabian et al 2003b ) , despite being over @xmath3 times larger .",
    "rising bubbles drag out cooler x - ray emitting gas ( as in the virgo cluster , churazov et al 2001 ) from the centre and cold gas ( the h@xmath4 filaments of ngc1275 : lynds 1970 ; conselice et al 2001 ; fabian et al 2003b ; fabian et al 2008 ) .    in this paper",
    "we present evidence for further structures along the bubbling axis which may be older , outer bubbles , or merged bubbles .    the cluster is assumed to have a redshift of 0.0183 , corresponding to an angular scale of 0.37 kpc arcsec@xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the new acis - i images have been mosaicked together into a single image 0.57  kev shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the average at each radius has been subtracted for display purposes .",
    "the central structure is associated with the bubbles formed by the radio jets from the active nucleus and is detailed in our earlier work .",
    "the separate acis - i chips are 16x16 arcmin and the whole image is 35.5 arcmin from n to s ( 788  kpc ) .        we have added the earlier 900  ks acis - s images to make the final composite , fig .  2 .",
    "the nucleus of most member galaxies of the perseus cluster are detected ( see santra et al 2007 ) . the point source in the image to the wsw of",
    "the nucleus of ngc1275 ( about halfway to the edge ) corresponds to the nucleus of the optically second - brightest cluster galaxy , ngc1272 ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "it sits on a rim of x - ray bright cluster emission .",
    "this rim is seen as a step at 67 armin radius from the nucleus of ngc1275 in fig .  4 and 5 , and is roughly circular in shape with a centre displaced 1  arcmin to the nw of that nucleus .",
    "we return to the large scale structure to the w in section 6 .    fig .  3",
    "right was produced with the 0.5  m telescope at the blackbird observatory , located in the south central sacramento mountains of new mexico usa . the image represents over 31  hr of cumulative exposure time through broadband clear , red , green , blue and 6  nm narrow band filters .",
    "each sub - exposure was reduced following standard procedures for bias correction and flat fielding . master dark and bias frames were created by combining 10 dark sub - exposures each produced at the same exposure length and camera temperature settings used for the luminance and the filtered images .",
    "a master flat was produced by combining 10 separate sky flat exposures for each filter .",
    "the clear , red , green , blue and 6 nm narrowband filtered exposures were separately combined ( using a median procedure ) to produce individual master data sets .",
    "each master data set was then projected into a gray scale image , intensity scaled , assigned to its appropriate primary color then digitally combined with the other data sets to produce a full color picture .",
    "the 6  nm narrowband data set was used to supplement the intensity of the red broadband color channel ; the clear data set was used to intensify luminance information for the combined data sets .",
    "post processing methods that resulted with the final image followed standard procedures that are also employed to create hubble heritage images ( rector et al 2007 ) .",
    "overlays of the new composite x - ray image with the h@xmath4 filaments around ngc1275 and deep radio data at 49  cm ( sijbring 1993 ) are shown in figs . 7 and 8 . as noted by fabian et al ( 2006 )",
    "there is a looplike x - ray structure at the end of the long northern h@xmath4 filament .",
    "this could be fallback of the outer parts of the cooler gas dragged out to the n by earlier bubbles , when the optical filament was created .",
    "further structures to the n are then expected and indeed observed .",
    "the radio image shows an extension at the end of the optical filament above which there is a spur leading to a dark patch in the x - ray image , corresponding to a drop in flux , which we call the northern trough .",
    "( burns et al 1994 published a deep 330  mhz vla radio image of perseus which shows similar outer structure , lending credence to the details being real . )",
    "just to the w of the radio spur lie two elliptical - shaped dips in the x - ray image which we identify as old outer bubbles .",
    "the outer of these was found originally on an outer chip of the deepest acis - s observations ( sanders & fabian 2007 ) .",
    "these structures are indicated in fig .  9 and shown in profile in fig .  10 .",
    "a bay is seen to the sse of ngc1275 ( fabian et al 2006 ) , along the bubble axis ( figs .  8 and 9 ) .",
    "the radio contours indicate a coincident minimum in radio flux .      the n trough ( structure labelled a in fig .",
    "6 ) lies 9 arcmin ( 200  kpc ) n of the nucleus .",
    "we have studied it through profiles made by spectral analysis along a sector to the n ( fig .",
    "it is about 10 percent deep in surface brightness and likely lies along , or close to , an equipotential .",
    "it is also along the main jet axis to the n where within the inner 40  kpc or so there is a pronounced optical h@xmath4 filament ( figs .  3 and 7 ) .",
    "if such a filament has been dragged out by rising large bubbles ( see fabian et al 2003 ; hatch et al 2006 ) then it is plausible that the trough could be the remains of those bubbles remains along the nnw - ssw direction . ] .",

    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we can start to explore a bubble origin by comparing the volume of the trough with that of one of the observed bubbles near the centre .",
    "a rough estimate of the volume of the trough can be made assuming that it is a ellipsoid with its major axis , of length 2.5 arcmin , i.e. 55 kpc , in the plane of the sky and radius 0.7 arcmin , i.e. 15.5 kpc .",
    "this provides a 10 per cent dip in surface brightness , as observed , if the integrated depth along the line of sight is equivalent to the central value multiplied by the radius from the nucleus .",
    "this volume is about @xmath7 , or about 21.5 times that of the inner n bubble , which has a radius of 8.5  kpc .    the external pressure drops by a factor of 3 between the centre and 10 arcmin radius where the trough resides ( fig .",
    "12 ) , which is a pressure of about @xmath8 .",
    "adiabatic expansion then gives a factor of about 2 increase in volume , so we are looking at the accumulation of about 11 bubbles similar to the present inner ones ( assuming the contents are preserved during the rise ) .",
    "the energy content of the trough , @xmath9 .",
    "this is one and two orders of magnitude smaller than the events that have occurred in the hydra a ( nulsen et al 2005 ) and ms0735.6 + 7421 ( mcnamara et al 2009 ) clusters , respectively .",
    "the possibility arises that the trough represents the accumulation of the last 500 myr or so of bubbles ( a similar structure is discussed for a2204 by sanders , fabian & taylor 2009 ) .",
    "bubbles rise and are trapped at some radius , in this case at about 220  kpc .",
    "perhaps they become neutrally buoyant there due to mixing with surrounding gas , or the magnetic structure ( possibly azimuthal there ; quataert et al 2008 ) traps them .",
    "there also seems to be an overall structure at and just within that radius to the w , possibly due to motion of the core relative to the outer cluster gas ( see e.g. churazov et al 2003 ) .",
    "the two x - ray surface brightness dips to the sw of the trough ( figs  9 and 10 ) , which we identify as rising bubbles , have volumes of approximately @xmath10 each , corresponding to about twice that of the current inner bubbles .    the bay to the south may result from the accumulation of southward rising bubbles in analogy to the northern trough .",
    "it has a sharp , curved northern edge and the interior is hotter than the outer parts ( fig .",
    "perhaps there has been some mixing and heating taking place between the relativistic and thermal intracluster gases .",
    "it lies much closer to the nucleus of ngc1275 .",

    "bubbles blown by a jet are not rayleigh - taylor unstable because the upper surface of the bubble is not at rest relative to the hot gas above them .",
    "the expansion of the bubbles means that the hot gas continuously flows around them .",
    "the growth time of the kelvin - helmholtz instability is comparable to the flow time .",
    "whether they break up or not depends on the amplitude and scale of velocity perturbations in the hot gas .",
    "the stability of a large gas bubble rising through liquid has been studied by batchelor ( 1987 ) .",
    "rising air bubbles in water can be surprisingly large .",
    "the scale size of disruptive perturbations depends on surface tension ( which in the case of cluster bubbles means magnetic field ) , viscosity and gravitational acceleration .",
    "lyutikov ( 2006 ) has proposed that magnetic draping can provide a surface tension .",
    "reynolds et al ( 2005 ) have discussed and simulated the role of viscosity in rising bubbles .",
    "higher viscosity leads to stable , long - lived , bubbles .",
    "diehl et al ( 2008 ) show that the bubbles seen at larger radii in several clusters tend to be much larger than those at smaller radii .",
    "larger even than expected by adiabatic expansion . in hydra",
    "a , where 3 pairs of expanding bubbles are identified ( wise et al 2007 ) there is a progressive steep increase of bubbles radius with distance from the nucleus ( see also randall et al 2011 for a sequence of bubbles in an elliptical galaxy ) .",
    "diehl et al ( 2008 ) discuss bubbles which are continuously fed energy from the nucleus , which seems unlikely for perseus .",
    "we note that if the rising speed of a bubble depends on its size and if a merger always occurs if two bubbles meet , then a sequence of bubbles of slightly varying size will at larger radii become a set of fewer larger bubbles .",
    "the radius at which this happens will depend on the steepness of the bubble size - speed relation and the initial size variation amplitude",
    ". it will happen both if larger ones are faster or slower .",
    "this could well explain our observations of the outer perseus bubbles .",
    "it is not clear what is happening to the s of the nucleus .",
    "the early observations showed an inner and an outer bubble there . at larger radii",
    "there is a sharp edge to part of an elliptical - shaped structure which we term the bay .",
    "this could represent the end point for bubbles rising in that direction .",
    "the temperature there ( fig .",
    "11 ) is hotter .",
    "this could either be because there is hotter gas at that radius , or it could be because relativistic plasma has displaced gas and we are only seeing the projected outer hotter intracluster gas .",
    "the pseudo - pressure maps ( fig .  13 and 14 ) do however peak in this region so the first option is preferred . the energy in this cavity , assuming it contains only thermal gas and a prolate - ellipsoidal shape , is @xmath11 , slightly more than for the northern trough .",
    "the new data have been contour - binned ( sanders 2007 ) into regions each with 22,500 counts ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the spectra within each bin have been fitted separately resulting in the temperature and metallicity maps shown in fig .",
    "the higher metallicity gas does stretch to the n in the direction of the trough , but no more detailed correspondence is evident .",
    "we also show a psuedo - pressure map ( obtained from the square root of the mean surface brightness in each region multiplied by the temperature ) .",
    "a semicircular cold front is seen to the w. across this front the temperature jumps from 5.5 - 6  kev to 7 to 8  kev , and the metallicity drops from 0.55 - 0.6 to 0.4 - 0.45 .",
    "the pressure declines relatively smoothly across the region ( see also figs .  16 and 17 in the appendix ) . the smooth pressure change",
    "while the temperature jumps is characteristic of a cold front ( see section 6 for further discussion ) .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "14 shows the temperature and pseudo - pressure maps obtained when the mean value at that radius ( from the nucleus of ngc1275 ) has been subtracted , to highlight small differences .",
    "minihaloes such as 3c84 are rare ( ferrari et al 2008 ) and may be due to turbulence ( gitti et al 2004 ) .",
    "there is a possible association between minihaloes and gas sloshing ( zuhone & markevitch 2011 ) in cluster cores ( mazzotta & giacintucci 2008 ) . the swirl seen in the temperature maps is indicative of gas sloshing , perhaps induced by an off - axis merger or at least the close passage of a stripped group core ( churazov et al 2003 ; ascasibar & markevitch 2006 ; roediger et al 2011 ) .",
    "we have noted interesting correlations between structures in the radio and x - ray maps ( fig .",
    "while there might be small scale turbulence in the hot gas , we doubt that there is considerable hydrodynamic turbulence due to the straightness and ordered structures of the h@xmath4 filaments .",
    "indeed the 4050  kpc long northern filament shows little evidence for turbulent flow .",
    "the large scale linearity of the bubble structures shown in fig .  8 , apart from the northern trough , is evidence against significant large scale flows or rotation of the core gas .",
    "if we conservatively take a minimum transverse motion of 50  kpc ( the semi - ajor axis of the trough ) over the time to make the structures , say @xmath13 , we obtain a maximum transverse velocity of @xmath0 .",
    "the w edge , rim and semi - circular structure seen in figs  1 , 2 , 5 , and 6 appears to separate the inner agn - dominated region from the outer cluster .",
    "as outlined in section 4 , the temperature rises sharply to the w of the structure , whereas the psuedo - pressure shows no abrupt change ( figs  13  16 ) .",
    "it therefore appears to be a cold - front ( for a review see markevitch & vikhlinin 2007 ) , and is probably related to a past subcluster merger ( churazov et al 2003 and section 5 ) .",
    "mergers producing slopping / sloshing / bathtub / seich - modes in the core of the perseus cluster have been discussed for decades ( see e.g. allen et al 1992 ) , since einstein observatory imaging showed the overall emission to be lop - sided ( branduardi - raymont et al 1982 ) .",
    "such modes can persist for a considerable time ( gyrs ) .",
    "cold fronts can form in the process ( e.g. birnoboim , keshet & herquist 2010 ) .",
    "tangential flows below the front and magnetic fields amplification are expected ( keshet et al 2010 ) .",
    "once again we note the lack of evidence for significant transverse flows in the relatively straight h@xmath4 filament system or indeed in the nnw  ssw bubble axis , so any cold front flows do not penetrate far .",
    "radial velocity measurements of the h@xmath4 filaments show smooth laminar flow ( hatch et al 2006 ; salom et al 2011).the radio mini - halo does end abruptly at the front .",
    "the metallicity also undergoes a sharp change ( fig",
    ".    the perseus cluster will be an excellent target for high resolution x - ray spectroscopy , such as anticipated with astro - h ( takahashi et al 2010 ) .",
    "this will resolve the velocities flows along the line of sight .",
    "both the central region where the bubbles form ( heinz et al 2010 ) and the w cold front will of great interest .",
    "( see eqn .  1 ) and total energy associated with the observed substructure @xmath14 ( eqn .  2 ) .",
    "the ratio of these quantities is plotted in the middle panel .",
    "the top panel shows an estimate of power ( eqn .",
    "3 ) needed to support the observed non - radial substructure .",
    "the horizontal dashed line shows an estimate of the central agn mechanical power , while the vertical line schematically divides the cluster into `` agn - dominated '' and `` merger - dominated '' parts .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.8% ]      in order to assess the energy associated with large scale structures in the perseus cluster , we have characterized the energy / power needed to produce observed substructure ( non - radial part ) in the icm ( e.g. fig .  6 ) .    in order to cover a large radial range we use xmm - newton data .",
    "while not providing a high resolution view on the perseus core , they extend to larger radii than the existing chandra data .",
    "we first made a deprojection analysis of the data in four wedges ( 90 deg each ) and for each wedge we calculated pressure in several radial shells spanning the range from few to 700 kpc .",
    "the thermal pressure @xmath15 was evaluated in each radial bin and root - mean - square variation of pressure between wedges was calculated as @xmath16 . the ratio of this quantity to the mean pressure at the same radius @xmath17 can be used as a crude characteristic of the magnitude of the substructure ( non - radial part ) in the cluster .",
    "we then calculated the total thermal energy @xmath18 of the icm within given radius @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the gas density and temperature at a given radius and estimated the energy associated with the substructure @xmath14 as @xmath22 the values of @xmath18 and @xmath14 and their ratio are plotted in the two bottom panels in fig .  15 . in the top panel",
    "the energy associated with substructure @xmath14 is divided by the sound crossing time of the region @xmath23 , where @xmath24 .",
    "the quantity @xmath25 can be regarded as an estimate of the power needed to maintain the observed non - radial substructure .    clearly these are order of magnitude estimates . by construction",
    "they are sensitive only to non - radial part of the substructure and only to the low angular modes .",
    "even more uncertain is the estimate of power ( top panel in fig .",
    "15 ) which uses the radial sound crossing time as an estimate of the time needed to dissolve the substructure .",
    "nevertheless , taken at face value this figure suggests that the cluster can be broadly divided into two zones at about 100 kpc .",
    "( the bright rim to the w of the nucleus is at a radius of @xmath26 , see figs .",
    "2 and 6).the estimates of the mechanical power of the central agn in ngc1275 gives values of order @xmath2 over the period of @xmath27 ( fabian et al 2006 ) .",
    "if the same estimate is applicable to the mean power during the last gyr , then the central agn is not capable of producing the asymmetry outside the central @xmath28 region .",
    "instead the most promising explanation for the substructure beyond 100 kpc is the merger of the perseus cluster with smaller galaxies / group along the chain of bright galaxies to the west of the core . at yet larger radii beyond 1  mpc and out to the virial radius , the intracluster gas appears to become become intrinsically clumpy ( simionescu et al 2011 ) .",
    "our wider image has revealed several structures consisting of dips in surface brightness along the nnw  sse axis which are plausibly outer rising bubbles .",
    "the two new ones are not much larger in pressure - corrected volume than the inner bubbles whereas the large trough to the north is an order of magnitude larger .",
    "bubbles must be long - lived and we suggest that they may grow in size by merger with other , slower , rising bubbles .    a roughly semi - circular cold front is see to the w of the nucleus of ngc1275 . the metallicity of the gas drops abruptly across the front .",
    "we suspect that the trough and a bay to the south are where rising bubbles have accumulated .",
    "the s bay is distinctly hotter than its surroundings so the relativistic plasma may have mixed with the intracluster gas there , unlike the situation of the n or the inner bubbles .",
    "both the n trough and the s bay lie along a continuation of the w cold front .",
    "the other structures seen at radii or 100 - 150  kpc are likely associated with a subcluster merger ( churazov et al 2003 ) .",
    "the merger also accounts for the e  w asymmetry in surface brightness across the image ( figs .  2 , 4 , 14 ) .    the energy in substructure peaks at small radii , where it is dominated by activity induced by the agn , and at larger radii , where it is dominated by the merger",
