    "the compton scattering of coherent light on an object is one of the most elementary processes of physics . in a general way , by measuring the angular and energy distributions of the scattered light information , the internal structure and the shape of the probed object can be accessed . with the advent of intense multi - gev lepton beam facilities , it has become possible to experimentally study the compton scattering at the smallest dimensions of matter : the nucleon at quark and gluon level , where it is called deep virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) .",
    "the term virtual here has the meaning that the incoming photon is radiated from a lepton beam , which presents the additional advantage of varying its 3-momentum independently of its energy .",
    "dvcs process @xmath8 , where the virtuality of the initial photon @xmath9 is much large compared to the squared momentum transfer @xmath10 , provides a valuable probe to the structure of the proton .    within the framework of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) ,",
    "we intercept such reaction at the partonic level through the concept of generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) @xcite .",
    "they are experimentally accessed through the overlap of dvcs and beith - heitler process as well as exclusive vector meson production @xcite .",
    "several experiments , such as , h1 collaboration @xcite , zeus collaboration @xcite and fixed target experiments at hermes @xcite have finished taking data on dvcs .",
    "experiments are also being done at jlab , hall a and b @xcite and compass at cern @xcite to access gpds .",
    "gpds not only allow us to access partonic configurations with a given longitudinal momentum fraction , similar to deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , but also at specific ( transverse ) location inside the hadron .",
    "gpds depend on three variables @xmath11 , where @xmath0 is the fraction of momentum transferred , @xmath5 gives the longitudinal momentum transfer and @xmath12 is the square of the momentum transfer in the process .",
    "however , it has to be realized that only two of these variables @xmath5 ( fully defined by detecting the scattered lepton @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the bjorken variable used in dis ) and @xmath12 ( fully defined by detecting either the recoil proton or meson ) are accessible experimentally .",
    "gpds are much richer in content and carry much more information about the hadron structure than ordinary parton distributions . in the forward limit of zero momentum transfer , the gpds reduce to ordinary parton distributions .",
    "the gpds give interesting information about the spin and orbital angular momentum of the quarks and gluons in the nucleon .",
    "it is well known that @xmath5 represents the longitudinal momentum transfer in the dvcs process and in particular @xmath15 represents the momentum transfer only in the transverse direction . in ref .",
    "@xcite , gpds have been studied for @xmath16 and it has also been shown that fourier transform of gpds w.r.t @xmath17 at @xmath16 gives ipdpdfs ( impact parameter dependent parton distribution functions ) . since , in the dvcs process , the transformation of a virtual photon into real photon requires a finite transfer of longitudinal momentum and the experiments always probe @xmath18 , it becomes desirable to develop a deeper understanding of gpds at @xmath18 .",
    "the situation for @xmath19 also has an important difference from @xmath16 because as the proton loses longitudinal momentum its transverse position is shifted by an amount which is proportional to @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "further , the `` transverse position '' of the proton is the vector sum of the transverse positions of its partons weighted by their longitudinal momentum fractions .",
    "therefore , when the proton loses its momentum its transverse position get shifted from its original place . even though the polynomiality conditions have to be satisfied by the gpds with @xmath18 , it is very difficult to obtain a suitable parametrization of higher fock states of the wave functions in certain models .",
    "this is possible only if one considers the light front wave functions ( lfwfs ) of simple spin 1/2 objects like dressed quark or a dressed electron in theory .",
    "gpds can be expressed as overlaps of lcwfs of the target hadron in light front gauge @xcite .",
    "we have generalized the framework of qed by assigning a mass @xmath20 to external electrons in the compton scattering process , but a different mass @xmath21 to the internal electron line and a mass @xmath22 to the internal photon line @xcite .",
    "the idea behind this is to model the structure of a composite fermion state with a mass @xmath20 by a fermion and a vector constituent with respective masses @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "these are off - forward overlaps in general and one requires not only particle conserving @xmath23 overlap similar to forward pdfs but also @xmath24 overlap .",
    "therefore , a spin 1/2 system can be represented as a composite of a spin 1/2 fermion and spin 1 vector boson with arbitrary masses @xcite .",
    "this one loop model is self consistent since it has correct correlation of different fock components of the state as given by light front eigen value equation .",
    "this model has been used to calculate the spin and orbital angular momentum of a composite relativistic system as well as the gpds in impact parameter space and it also gives the schwinger anomalous magnetic moment and the corresponding dirac s and pauli form factor including the vanishing of the anomalous gravitomagnetic moment b(0 ) .",
    "it provides a template for the wave function of an effective quark - diquark model of the valence fock state of the proton lfwf .",
    "we would like to emphasize here that this is extremely difficult to achieve in phenomenological models .",
    "in particular , two or three body fock components can be obtained analytically from qed .",
    "further , by taking the fourier conjugate @xmath25 ( impact parameter ) of the transverse momentum transfer @xmath17 , the gpds can be expressed in impact parameter space . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the model with simulated bound state has been discussed .",
    "it is clear from these calculations that without involving the simulated bound state of the wave functions , one has to introduce the cut off on the momenta in the integrals for the expressions of gpds . but",
    "differentiating the wave function w.r.t bound state mass @xmath26 improves the behavior of wave functions near the end points of @xmath0 as well as at high @xmath27 . differentiating the wave function w.r.t .",
    "@xmath26 produces a meson like behavior but it does not represent a model for meson . even though some work has been done in the simulated model of lfwfs @xcite where gpds were discussed in impact parameter space i.e. by considering @xmath28 but no work has been done so far for the case of @xmath19 .",
    "there are three distinct regions in @xmath0 . in the domain where @xmath29 , there are diagonal @xmath30 overlap contributions for both helicity non - flip @xmath31 and helicity flip @xmath32 . the gpds @xmath33 and @xmath34 vanishes in the domain @xmath35 . in the domain @xmath36 , we have contribution from non diagonal @xmath24 overlap .",
    "since the differentiation of the single particle lfwf gives a vanishing result , this contribution vanishes in this model .",
    "it has also been shown that the dvcs amplitude expressed in terms of the variable @xmath37 show diffraction pattern analogous to diffractive scattering of a wave in optics where the distribution in @xmath37 measures the physical size of the scattering center in a 1-d system @xcite .",
    "the finite size of the @xmath5 integration of the fourier transform acts as a slit width and produces the diffraction pattern .",
    "therefore , it becomes interesting to study the gpds and the fourier transform ( ft ) of the gpds in the transverse as well as longitudinal position space .    in the present work ,",
    "we have calculated the @xmath38 and @xmath39 for non zero skewness . to understand the significance of the momentum fraction carried by the quarks in the process , we have considered the cases for fixed @xmath0 and different values of @xmath5 as well as for fixed @xmath5 and different values of @xmath0 .",
    "both gpds @xmath38 and @xmath39 are studied in longitudinal and transverse position space by taking fourier transform w.r.t . @xmath5 and @xmath17 giving the distribution of partons in the longitudinal position space and the distribution in the transverse position space respectively .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we present the essential kinematics of deeply virtual compton scattering @xcite ^*(q ) + p(p ) ( q ) + p(p ) .",
    "the frame is specified by choosing a convenient parametrization of the light - cone coordinates for the initial and final proton : p & = & ( p^+ ,  _ ,   ) , + p^ & = & ( ( 1-)p^+ ,  - _ , ) , where @xmath20 is the proton mass .",
