    "it is well known that information on the nucleon internal structure is contained in the electromagnetic structure functions or in the one photon exchange cross section , @xmath7 , for the deep inelastic lepton scattering off nucleons .",
    "however , a determination of the one photon cross section from the data , which is a goal of electroproduction ( i.e.  electron and muon scattering ) experiments , demands excluding contributions from other electroweak processes .",
    "these processes account for a large fraction of the measured cross section , especially in the low @xmath0 and high @xmath1 region .",
    "they can not be discarded from the measured cross section on the event  by  event basis ; the measured differential cross section can instead be multiplied by a correction factor calculated theoretically .",
    "this is called a radiative correction procedure .",
    "the first radiative correction scheme was created in the sixties by l.w .",
    "mo and y.s .",
    "tsai @xcite ( mt scheme ) in connection with the early slac electron scattering experiments .",
    "another approach , originally formulated for the cern muon scattering experiment planned by the bcdms collaboration , was suggested by the dubna group in the seventies @xcite and upgraded later @xcite(d scheme ) . in the analysis of the data from the deep inelastic electroproduction experiments ,",
    "both schemes were extensively used ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) , the mt scheme often in the exact ( i.e.  no ` peaking approximation ' ) and upgraded version . however , the precision of the recent experiments is so high , see  e.g.@xcite , that also the radiative correction procedure has to be based on more precise theoretical calculations .",
    "therefore understanding similarities and differences in the two radiatiative correction schemes is of ultimate importance for concluding about consistency of results coming from different experiments .",
    "the goal of this paper is to compare analytically as well as numerically the most upgraded versions of the two approaches .",
    "our experience with the radiative correction procedure in the deep inelastic experiments carried out at cern by the emc , nmc and bcdms collaborations allows to point out the problems encountered during the application of this procedure in the data analysis .",
    "the previous comparisons between the two considered methods were limited to analysing the numerical results of the early versions of the schemes @xcite or only dealt with a subset of the radiative processes @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "the deep inelastic kinematics and cross sections are defined .",
    "sections 3 and 4 , together with appendices a and b contain a description of the mt and d schemes respectively .",
    "a complete set of formulae is given for each scheme using the original notation .",
    "only minor simplifications and changes are introduced for the sake of clarity .",
    "useful relations between the respective notations are given in the appendix c. the schemes are then compared in sections 5 ( theoretical ideas ) and 6 ( numerical results ) and finally a summary is given in section 7 .",
    "as mentioned above , a goal of electroproduction experiments is to extract the differential cross section in the one photon exchange approximation ( fig .",
    "1a ) from the data .",
    "this cross section can be expressed in the following way by the structure functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 of the target : @xmath10\\ , .",
    "\\label{basic}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this equation @xmath11 is the fine structure constant , @xmath12 is the electron ( muon ) mass , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the square of the four  momentum transfer between the incoming and outgoing lepton , @xmath15/@xmath16 the bjorken scaling variable , @xmath17 is taken as the proton mass , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the lepton s incident energy and energy transfer in the proton rest frame and @xmath20 .    the one photon exchange process described by the eq .",
    "( [ basic ] ) , is a part of the lowest order ( or born ) electroproduction cross section , @xmath21 .",
    "the other part of @xmath21 proceeds from the @xmath22 boson exchange .",
    "the two contributions can not be separated experimentally . however in the present fixed target experiments the involved virtualities ( i.e.  the @xmath23 values ) are small comparing to the @xmath22 mass squared and therefore eq.([basic ] ) is a good approximation of the born cross section .",
    "the @xmath22 contribution will be discussed later in more detail .",
    "the differential cross section ( 1 ) can also be expressed in terms of structure functions @xmath9 and @xmath24 : @xmath25\\ , \\label{basicp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is defined as : @xmath27 @xmath28 and @xmath29 denote the cross sections for the longitudinally and transversally polarised virtual photon respectively .",
    "as mentioned earlier the radiative events account for a large fraction of the measured cross section , @xmath30 .",
    "these effects may lead to a wrong interpretation of the measured event kinematics .",
    "for example an elastic scattering from the target can be mistaken for a deep inelastic event if it is accompanied by an energetic bremsstrahlung photon not measured in the experiment .",
    "the magnitude of the radiative effects in the measured cross section will be characterized by the so called radiative correction factor , @xmath31 , defined as follows : @xmath32 this factor is used in the data analysis @xcite and will also be employed in comparing results of calculations between different radiative correction schemes .",
    "finally we have to stress that in the most of the deep inelastic experiments only the inclusive measurements are performed .",
    "this means that only incident and scattered leptons are measured and kinematics of the reaction is defined by the leptonic observables .",
    "however the kinematics of radiative events can not be defined by leptonic variables only , e.g.  a bremsstrahlung photon emission by the lepton results in a _ measured _ @xmath23 different from the _ actual _ one .",
    "therefore , when appropriate , we shall make a clear distinction between the hadron and lepton  defined variables .",
    "in the original mt scheme @xcite the following processes were considered to contribute to the measured electron  proton inelastic cross section : real photon bremsstrahlung from an initial and final electron ( fig .",
    "1b ) , vertex correction ( fig .",
    "1c ) and vacuum polarisation correction ( fig .",
    "1d ) . in the latter one",
    "only the electron and muon loops were originally considered .",
    "the proton structure was accounted for through the two unspecified structure functions .",
    "the mt scheme formulation is thus model independent .",
    "the mathematical formulation of the mt is non - covariant .",
    "corrections depicted by the diagrams in fig .",
    "1 can be divided into two groups : emission of real photons ( fig .",
    "1b ) with energy larger than @xmath33 and those with energy smaller than @xmath33 ( fig .",
    "1b ) together with virtual corrections ( fig .",
    "contributions from the soft photon emission and from the vertex correction _ separately _ are infrared divergent but the divergences cancel when the contributions are considered jointly @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath33 may have a meaning of the energy resolution or in another words a maximal energy of the emitted photon which is still not detectable in the experiment .",
    "it is often called the ` infrared cut  off ' parameter .",
    "this interpretation implies that @xmath33 may not be too large .",
    "too small @xmath33 must also be avoided since it may cause numerical instabilities in the computation of the soft photon contribution .",
    "the numerical results of the calculations should not depend on @xmath33 .    in the mt approach",
    "the measured cross section can be expressed as follows ( see appendix a for the definitions of variables used in mt publications ) : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a residuum of the cancellation of the infrared divergent terms and takes into account all soft photon emissions in the lowest order of @xmath11 . it is a well known fact that the infrared divergencies cancel in each order in @xmath11 @xcite and therefore it is possible to sum up contributions from all soft photon emissions @xcite .",
    "the exponential factor , @xmath36 , in eq.([mtmaster ] ) is a result of this summation .",
    "the function @xmath37 contains all @xmath38independent terms : @xmath39 where given here is the full formula . the approximation @xmath40 holds for @xmath41 ( see e.g.  eqs  5 and a1 from ref .",

    "the integration over @xmath51 in eq.([mtails ] ) means that all the final hadronic states contribute to the cross section measured in a kinematical point @xmath52 , fig .  2 , so called ` radiative tails ' : elastic ( @xmath53 ) , resonance production ( @xmath54 ) ... and deep inelastic tails , i.e.  tails from the continuum .",

    "in the dubna scheme the calculations of the deep inelastic processes are based on a mixed approach which uses both a model independent and the quark parton model treatment of the radiative corrections .",
    "the radiative corrections to the leptonic current ( fig .",

    "( [ master ] ) , the weak loop correction contribution is also present in the d formulation .",
    "it is calculated within the qpm framework ; details are given in @xcite .",
    "second , the @xmath117 corrections ( @xmath118 contributions to the cross section ) not shown explicitely , were also implemented . for the elastic radiative tail",
    "they were calculated completely in the first paper of ref .",
    "@xcite , while for the inelastic continuum they were implemented in an approximate way , described in the second paper of ref . @xcite .",
    "results of deep inelastic experiments were analysed using either mt or d radiative correction schemes .",
    "therefore it is of ultimate importance to understand the differences and similarities between the two approaches . in this section",
    "we shall make a brief summary of theoretical ideas in the two schemes ; numerical comparison will be presented in the next section .",
    "to faciliate the comparison , the relations between the variables used in the mt and d formulae are given in appendix c.    the d scheme is formulated in a covariant way and its model dependent part is based on the quark parton model .",
    "the covariant formulation means that all formulae are expressed in terms of the lorentz invariants and are thus independent of the choice of the reference frame .",
    "this also means that the d scheme is explicitly independent of the infrared cut  off parameter @xmath33 , cf .",
    "( [ master ] ) .",
    "the @xmath38 independence was obtained through a special mathematical procedure .",
    "the mt scheme is not covariantly formulated .",
    "it should also be @xmath38independent which formally means that the derivative over @xmath33 of the right hand side of eq.([mtmaster ] ) should be equal to zero .",
    "the calculations show that this does not hold and that a certain dependence of the results on @xmath33 should be observed . for not too small @xmath33",
    "this dependence is very weak .",
    "for very small @xmath33 ( apart of numerical instabilities ) , eq.([mtmaster ] ) depends much stronger on the value of @xmath33 which in this case should be calculated separately for every kinematical point ( i.e. for every @xmath119 value ) in order to minimise the dependence .",
    "the elastic and resonance tails ( i.e.  the contribution of the reactions with the elastic and resonance final states ) are calculated in the same way in both schemes .",
    "the inelastic tails ( the contribution of the reactions with the inelastic final states ) originating from the leptonic bremsstrahlung are treated differently but the differences are purely mathematical . the inelastic tail in the mt is calculated with the same formula as the elastic one ( eq .  ( [ mtails ] ) ) where the inelasticity of the process is taken into account through integration over kinematically allowed final state masses .",
    "the corresponding structure functions , @xmath120(see appendix a ) , are not specified ; in practical applications the electromagnetic structure functions are used . the leptonic inelastic tail in d is also calculated with arbitrary structure functions while tails originating from the hadronic bremsstrahlung were calculated within the quark parton model framework .",
    "the usage of the parton model in the d scheme allows to calculate the hadron current corrections in the inelastic case as well as a double photon exchange process ; they are calculated up to @xmath121 .",
    "the hadron current corrections can not be calculated in the mt approach and therefore such corrections were not taken into account .",
    "the @xmath57 loop is also naturally present in the vacuum polarisation process in the d scheme while in the mt it was only added later .",
    "the same is true for the weak interactions contributions ( @xmath22 exchange and the @xmath122 interference ) .",
    "the weak contributions are however very small as compared to the present experimental resolution .",
    "finally the @xmath118 lepton current corrections were partially taken into account in the d scheme but not in the mt .",
    "a tremendous increase of the accuracy of deep inelastic electroproduction experiments demands a similar increase of the accuracy of the radiative corrections calculations .",
    "therefore the early versions of these calculations have constantly been improved . at the same time comparisons between the two considered schemes",
    "were made , @xcite . in the analysis of the recent very precise mesurements by the nmc @xcite both schemes",
    "were used in their most upgraded versions and applied for nucleon and nuclear targets .",
    "the mt code , named ferrad35 , apart of the processes contained in the eqs ( [ mtmaster])([mtails ] ) included also the tau lepton and quark loops and the photon@xmath123-boson interference .",
    "the tails were treated in an exact way in contrast to the peaking approximation @xcite applicable for the electron deep inelastic scattering , a detailed input information ( structure functions , form factors , nuclear structure models , etc ) was introduced @xcite .",
    "the d code , named terad86 , was in principle used in the same version as sketched by the formulae ( [ master ] )  ( [ alfa ] ) and employed in the dedicated bcdms experiment @xcite , except that the ferrad35 input information was supplied . in this section",
    "we shall compare the ferrad35 and terad86 results on the radiative correction factors , @xmath124 , as well as on the elastic radiative tails .",
    "comparisons will be done in the kinematical region of the nmc positive muon ",

    "the input information in the calculations was as follows : gari and krmpelman proton form factor parametrisation , @xcite structure function @xmath127 as measured and parametrised by the nmc , @xcite , and finally for the @xmath24 the parametrisation of slac was taken for all @xmath0 and @xmath1280.35 gev@xmath4 . for smaller @xmath23 the value of @xmath26",

    "the main numerical problem in the radiative correction programs is an integration of the radiative tails .",
    "for example , the integrand of eq .",
    "( [ mtails ] ) changes by 27 orders of magnitude within the integration interval .",
    "it is obvious that this function should be integrated either by a high accuracy routines ( e.g.  the cernlib gauss routine demands an accuracy parameter @xmath130 @xmath131 ) or by dividing the integration interval into many small sections .",
    "it seems however that the best method would be to change the integration variable from @xmath132 to log@xmath133 but also in this case high accuracy of the integrating routines is needed .",
    "this method was used in terad86 while in ferrad35 dividing the @xmath132 integration interval into many sections was normally employed ( logarithmic integration in ferrad35 was also tried and gave the same results ) . due to the subtraction procedure in d",
    "the integrands in eqs  ( [ dtails ] ) and ( [ dir ] ) are fairly smooth and do not demand any extreme precision of integration .",

    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "4 . in the region of low @xmath0 and large @xmath1 where the radiative correction factor @xmath135 is largest , the results are only weakly dependent on @xmath134 for @xmath136200 mev .",

    "the agreement between the results of the two schemes is better than 2@xmath2 , cf .",

    "however the @xmath139 and @xmath57 loop contributions in the vacuum polarisation process ( fig.1.d ) , absent in the original version of the mt scheme and included in ferrad35 , give up to 2@xmath2 contribution to the radiative correction factor in most of the kinematic region ( fig.6 , open symbols denote results of calculations _ without _ those contributions ) .",
    "fluctuations visible in the high @xmath0 part of the curves in fig.6 come from numerical instabilities of ferrad35 in that region .",
    "the two existing schemes of radiative correction procedure , the mo and tsai and the dubna ones are differently formulated and are ( partially ) based on a different physics approaches . both were extensively used in analysing the high energy experimental data . in this paper",
    "we presented the two schemes in detail and compared them analytically and numerically from the point of view of their effect on the results of the deep inelastic positive muon scattering from a proton target at 280 gev . to this aim",
    "we used the latest version of the d and the upgraded version of the mt programs .",
    "the latter included the @xmath140 and @xmath57 loops in the vacuum polarisation and the virtual photon@xmath123 boson interference terms , all absent in the original formulation .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath141 interference the quark loop contribution turned out to be quite substantial , changing the total radiative correction by about 2@xmath2 in the measured region .    the mt scheme contains the ` infrared cut  off ' parameter , @xmath33 .",
    "the results should not depend on its value ( provided it is not too large and not too low ) and indeed it is approximately so when @xmath33 is equal to about 0.1@xmath2 of the beam energy value .",
    "the covariant formulation of the d scheme excludes the existence of such parameter .",
    "the overall radiative correction reaches 50@xmath2 at low @xmath0 and high @xmath1 . calculated from the two schemes the corrections agree to better than 2@xmath2 in this region .",
    "differences are thus insignificant over the most of the phase space covered in the fixed target dis experiments .",
    "they are of the order of other systematic errors in the data analysis @xcite .",
