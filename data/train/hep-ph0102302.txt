    "it is the purpose of the present work to provide an estimate of the pcac corrections which enter in the evaluation of the two photon decay rates of the pseudoscalars under the sole assumptions that the v - a - a vertex is given by the quark triangle graph in the deep euclidean region and that the main contribution to su(3)@xmath21su(3 ) breaking arises from the energy interval @xmath25 of the @xmath24 continuum .    in section",

    "little is known about the integrand over the cut which consists of the contribution of the axial - vector @xmath58 and pseudoscalar @xmath59 intermediate states.the contribution of the low energy region(the three pion states ) is suppressed by loop factors and amounts to little @xcite .",
