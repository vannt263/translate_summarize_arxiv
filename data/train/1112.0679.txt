    "the optical continuum variability of quasars has been recognized since their first optical identification ( matthews & sandage 1963 ) , and it has been proposed and utilized as an efficient method for their discovery ( van den bergh , herbst , prit- + chet 1973 ; hawkins 1983 ; hawkins & veron 1995 ; ivezi et al .",
    "2004a ; rengstorf et al .",
    "the observed characteristics of the variability can then be used to constrain the origin of their emission ( e.g. , kawaguchi et al .",
    "1998 ; trevese , kron & bunone 2001 , and references therein ) .",
    "the variability of quasars has typically been quantified using a structure function ( sf ) analysis ( e.g. , hughes et al .",
    "1992 ; collier & peterson 2001 ; bauer et al .",
    "2009 ; kozowski et al .  2010b ; welsh , wheatley , & neil 2011 ) , where the sf is the root - mean - square ( rms ) magnitude change ( ) as a function of the time lag ( @xmath3 ) between measurements ( similar to an auto - correlation function ) .",
    "it is fairly well established that quasar variability properties depend on physical properties such as the quasar luminosity , wavelength , time scale , and the presence of radio emission . however , despite the considerable observational effort invested over last few decades , many conflicting claims about various correlations exist in the literature ( see giveon et al .",
    "1999 for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "the traditional method for studying variability has been to monitor a small , select sample of quasars over a long time baseline ( e.g. , hawkins 2002 ; giveon et al .",
    "1999 ; rengstorf et al .",
    "2004 ) . in this case",
    ", it is possible to compute the sf for each quasar , which can later be sample - averaged or studied individually .",
    "an alternative , utilized in more recent studies based on sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) and palomar observatory sky survey ( poss ; minkowski & abell 1963 ) data , is to compute a single sf for all quasars in a particular wavelength or luminosity range .",
    "this approach , mandated by the fact that typically only a few epochs were available per object , only measures _ ensemble _ properties and _ assumes _ that all quasars selected from a narrow range of physical properties vary in the same way . nevertheless , this approach enabled studies of quasar optical variability based on tens of thousands of objects and several hundred thousand photometric observations , as well as explorations of the long - term variability ( vanden berk et al .",

    "2005 ; de  vries , becker , white , & loomis 2005 , hereafter dv05 ; sesar et al .",
    "2006 , hereafter ses06 ) .",
    "for example , the size and quality of the sample analyzed by vb04 ( two - epoch photometry for 25,000 spectroscopically confirmed quasars ) allowed them to constrain how quasar variability in the rest frame optical / uv regime depends upon rest frame time lag ( up to @xmath42 years ) , luminosity , rest wavelength , redshift , the detection of radio or x - ray emission , and the presence of broad absorption line systems . by comparing sdss and poss measurements for 20,000 quasars spectroscopically",
    "confirmed by the sdss , ses06 constrained the optical quasar variability on time scales from 10 to 50 years ( in the observer s frame ) .",
    "they report that there is a characteristic time scale of order 1 year in the quasar rest frame beyond which the sf flattens to a constant value .",
    "the sdss has also facilitated both individual- and ensemble - based approaches by providing a large multi - epoch sample of quasars over the northern galactic cap and well - sampled light curves in the southern stripe 82 ( s82 ) survey .",
    "it is reassuring that the two approaches lead to similar sfs , as discussed by dv05 .",
    "a test of this assumption is also described in macleod et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , who show that indeed the _ mean _ behavior is the same . with such large samples , the ensemble sf ( ) slopes",
    "are well - constrained , and the values suggest that accretion disk instabilities are the most likely mechanism causing the observed optical variability ( vb04 ; kawaguchi et al",
    ".  1998 ; see also lyubarskii 1997 ) .",
    "however , attempts to constrain physical models using the ensemble sf are invalid as soon as one realizes that the ensemble sf ( ) is a weighted sum of individual quasars with different structure functions ( macleod et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "while studies have traditionally examined `` non - parametric '' statistical measures of variability such as the sf , a major challenge has been to describe the variability of individual quasars in a compact way .",
    "recently , the introduction of a damped random walk ( drw ) model has provided a way to mathematically characterize quasar light curves in terms of a characteristic time scale ( @xmath5 ) and an amplitude ( @xmath6 ) which are then correlated with the physical properties such as luminosity and black hole mass .",
    "kelly et al .",
    "( 2009 , hereafter kbs09 ) modeled a sample of 100 quasar light curves as a drw and suggested that thermal fluctuations driven by an underlying stochastic process such as a turbulent magnetic field may be the dominant cause for the optical flux fluctuations .",
    "kozowski et al .",
    "( 2010a ; hereafter koz10 ) applied the drw model to the well - sampled optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) light curves ( udalski et al .",

    "2008 ) of mid - infrared - selected quasars behind the magellanic clouds from kozowski & kochanek ( 2009 ) .",
    "their analysis shows that the drw model is robust enough to efficiently select quasars from other variable sources , despite the large surface density of foreground magellanic cloud stars ( see also butler & bloom 2011 ; macleod et al .",
    "2011 ; kozowski et al .",
    "2011a ) .    in macleod",
    "et al .  ( 2010 , hereafter mac10 ) , we applied the drw model to the light curves of 10,000 quasars in s82 and found a correlation between @xmath6 and black hole mass which is independent of the anti - correlations with luminosity and wavelength ( see also ai et al .  2010 ; meusinger et al .  2011 ) .",
    "we also found that @xmath5 increases with increasing wavelength , remains nearly constant with redshift and luminosity , and increases with increasing black hole mass ( see also kbs09 ; koz10 ) . in kelly et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , it was shown that a similar stochastic model but with multiple time scales for a single object can accurately reproduce the x - ray variability of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and microquasars .",
    "an inhomogeneous accretion disk model , where the temperature fluctuations throughout the disk are driven by a drw process , can explain the disk sizes derived from microlensing light curves ( see morgan et al .",
    "2010 ) while matching the observed level of optical variability , and predicts seds which are in better agreement with observations than standard thin disk models ( dexter & agol 2011 ) .    one defining feature of the drw model for a _ single _",
    "quasar is that it predicts a gaussian distribution of magnitude differences for a given . on the other hand , the observed  distribution in the optical for an _ ensemble _ of quasars observed at two times separated by  deviates strongly from a gaussian but is well fit by an exponential distribution ( i04 ) .",
    "this conflict represents an important puzzle for understanding the drw model and its applicability to quasar light curves . also , the high likelihood of extreme values of  has important implications for the interpretation of observations of transients .",
    "for example , vanden berk et al .  (",
    "2002 ) reported the detection of an orphan gamma - ray burst afterglow based on the 2.5 magnitude decrease in optical flux .",
    "such a large flux change was inconsistent with a quasar based on a gaussian model for their variability , but the source was nevertheless confirmed to be a highly variable quasar ( gal - yam et al .",
    ". an accurate statistical description of the two - epoch photometry for ensembles of quasars will be important for transient detection in large surveys , where quasars represent a major contaminant .",
    "our goal here is to produce a unified view of ensemble and individual optical variability in the context of the drw model . in this study , we show that the differences in shape between the ensemble sf and the drw sf are well - explained by averaging over the properties of individual quasars .",
    "we also show that the exponential distributions of magnitude changes for ensembles of quasars at fixed time lag are naturally constructed by summing the intrinsically gaussian distributions of magnitude changes produced by individual quasars .",
    "there are several residual issues which we discuss as part of the comparison .",
    "an overview of the sdss and poss data used in this study is presented in section  [ data ] . in section  [ ov ]",
    ", we describe the observed ensemble quasar variability in terms of the sf as a function of wavelength and time lag in the observer s frame .",
    "we then convert to rest - frame quantities and compare the data to a model ensemble sf based on our previous drw analysis of s82 light curves . in section  [ lt ] , we combine the constraints on short - term quasar variability based on sdss data with the constraints on long - term variability derived from matching the sdss and poss catalogs . in section  [ fs ] , we discuss the implications our results have on transient identification , with a focus on future time - domain surveys such as the palomar transient factory and the large synoptic survey telescope .",
    "our results are discussed and summarized in section  [ disc ] .",
    "in this section , we briefly summarize the relevant sdss and poss data .",

    "the dr7 sky coverage results in photometric measurements for about 357 million unique objects .",
    "astrometric positions are accurate to better than 0.1 arcsec per coordinate ( rms ) for sources brighter than 20.5  mag ( pier et al .",
    "2003 ) , and the morphological information from the images allows robust star - galaxy separation to 21.5  mag ( lupton et al .",
    "2001 ) . a compendium of technical details about the sdss can be found in stoughton et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "the sdss offers an unprecedented photometric accuracy for such a large scale optical survey .",
    "not only are the photometric errors generally small , but they are accurately determined by the photometric pipeline ( _ photo _ , lupton et al .",
    "2001 ) and can be reliably used to estimate the statistical significance of measured magnitude differences .",
    "this ability is of paramount importance for a robust statistical study of variable objects .",
    "this error behavior is illustrated in figure  2 in ivezi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . throughout our analysis",
    ", we assume the sdss photometric errors to be @xmath14  mag in @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 bands , and 0.04  mag in @xmath8 and @xmath12 ( see also figure  1 in sesar et al .",
    "the photometric errors are assumed to be independent of magnitude due to the bright sample limit of @xmath15 ( see next section ) , and for simplicity when accounting for photometric errors in the sf calculations .",
    "the sdss imaging data are obtained by imaging the sky in six parallel scanlines , each 13.5 arcmin wide ( a `` strip '' in sdss terminology ) .",
    "the six scanlines from two adjacent scans are then interleaved to make a filled `` stripe '' .",
    "because of the scan overlaps , and because the scans converge near the survey poles , 40% of the sky in the northern survey is essentially surveyed twice .",
    "in addition , 290 deg@xmath13 of the southern survey area lies along stripe 82 ( s82 ) and has been observed about 60 times on average to search for variable objects and , by stacking the frames , to go deeper ( frieman et al .  2008 ; annis et al .",
    "this valuable subsample contains well - sampled light curves for 9,258 spectroscopically confirmed quasars whose variability properties are analyzed in mac10 , and it can be used to verify some of the results inferred from the analysis of two repeated observations .",
    "overall , the sdss has obtained multi - epoch data for 4,000 deg@xmath13 of sky , with time scales ranging from 2 hours to over 9 years , and with a wide range of galactic latitudes extending all the way to the galactic plane .",
    "we define a quasar as any object listed in the sdss catalog of spectroscopically confirmed quasars ( the `` dr7 quasar catalog '' , schneider et al .",
    "its most recent fifth edition lists the sdss dr7 best photometry for 105,783 quasars from 9,380 deg@xmath13 . for a description of the spectroscopic target selection for quasars , see richards et al .",
    "we note that the quality of photometry is good for the objects in the dr7 quasar catalog . in total , there are 33,881 spectroscopically confirmed quasars with at least two observations .",
    "we provide a catalog of all the sdss repeated imaging of quasars online ( see the appendix for a detailed catalog description ) .",
    "the sky distribution of repeatedly imaged quasars is shown in figure  [ radec ] .",
    "when we compare pairs of observations , we use the secondary imaging observation with the largest time lag from the primary imaging observation listed in the dr7 quasar catalog , for a total of two observations per quasar .",
    "we define @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the magnitude observed at a later epoch than @xmath18 .",
    "we omit the s82 quasars since we do not wish to test our model on the same sample of objects from which the drw model parameters were derived .",
    "the dr7 quasar catalog is spectroscopically complete to @xmath15 in the quasar region of color space .",
    "therefore , unless otherwise noted , we require that the primary observation for the remaining 24,627 quasars has @xmath19 in order to be consistent with the flux limit of the quasar sample , for a total of 14,939 quasars . given the sdss limit of @xmath422  mag , we further restrict the magnitude differences in each band to @xmath20  mag in order to reduce the amount of contamination by poor photometry , for a total of 80,000 pairs of sdss measurements ( summed over all bands ) .",
    "finally , we adopt the redshifts and absolute magnitudes listed in the schneider et al .",
    "( 2010 ) spectroscopic quasar catalog , and the black hole masses as measured from emission lines by shen et al .",
    "all magnitudes are corrected for galactic extinction using schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "while sdss s82 obtained measurements with time differences of up to 10 years , longer time scales of up to 50 years can be probed by comparing the sdss and poss catalogs .",
    "ses06 have addressed the problem of large systematic errors in poss photometry by recalibrating several publicly available poss catalogs ( usno - a2.0 , usno - b1.0 , dposs and gsc2.2 ) .",
    "a piecewise recalibration of the poss data in 100 arcmin@xmath21 patches ( one sdss field ) generally resulted in an improvement of photometric accuracy ( rms ) by nearly a factor of two compared to the original data ( poss - i magnitudes can be improved to @xmath40.15 mag accuracy , and poss - ii magnitudes to @xmath40.10 mag accuracy ) .",
    "in addition to the smaller core width of the error distribution , the tails of the distribution become much steeper after the recalibration .",
    "these improvements are mostly due to the very dense grid of calibration stars provided by the sdss , which rectifies the intrinsic inhomogeneities of schmidt plates .",
    "the much longer time lags between the palomar observatory sky surveys ( poss - i and poss - ii ) and the sdss ( up to @xmath450 years ) than spanned by the available sdss data make it easier to detect deviations of the sf from a simple power - law . dv05 and",
    "ses06 compared the sdss and poss data for over 10,000 quasars from the sdss data release 2 in order to constrain the long - term quasar variability . as discussed by ses06 , the dv05 and ses06 measurements of the sf agree within a @xmath22 uncertainty of the ses06 measurements . here",
    ", we use results from both the dv05 and ses06 studies . we also make use of data from the digitized palomar observatory sky survey ( dposs ; djorgovski et al .",
    "1998 ) that overlap 8,000  deg@xmath13 of sky from the sdss data release 5 .",
    "these dposs data were recalibrated following the procedure outlined by ses06 .",
    "there are 81,189 sdss dr7 quasars with dposs observations in the @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 bands , and we provide their 2-epoch photometry at the same website ( see footnote 12 ) . for our analysis in section  [ lt ] , we use the primary sdss observations as listed in the dr7 quasar catalog when comparing sdss  dposs magnitudes .",
    "we calculate synthetic poss @xmath26 magnitudes from the sdss photometry , require @xmath15 , and impose various quality cuts following ses06 . in total , we have 56,732 sdss  dposs  measurements .",
    "for our sf analysis , we examine the behavior in both the observer s and the quasar rest frames because the former is informative for data interpretation ( e.g. , transients in large surveys ) and the latter constrains quasar physics . the sf behavior in the observer s frame",
    "is discussed in section  [ of ] , and we convert to rest - frame quantities in section  [ rf ] . we handle various trends with observed properties by taking narrow ranges of the relevant quantities , in particular , the time lag and wavelength in each frame .",
    "the luminosity , mass , and redshift information are utilized in section  [ rf ] , where we test whether the scalings with these physical parameters derived from individual light curves in s82 can reproduce the ensemble variability of the two - epoch sample .",
    "assuming that the observed variability reflects the physics in the accretion disk , the behavior in the observer s reference frame will be a convolution of rest - frame variability over redshift , luminosity , and other parameters . while this convolution will obscure important physical scalings , quasar variability in the observer s reference frame is still of major interest when interpreting survey data , in particular when distinguishing between quasars and other variable sources such as transients , or in using variability to select quasars .",
    "therefore , we start by considering quasar variability in the observer s frame .",
    "figure  [ cumulative ] shows the cumulative distribution of  in the sdss @xmath8 , @xmath10 and @xmath12 bands for four different  ranges .",
    "the thin lines show the predicted distributions based on gaussian ( dotted ) and exponential ( dashed ) analytic functions with the same rms as the data .",
    "the photometric errors are taken into account by adding a gaussian component of width @xmath14  mag in @xmath10 and 0.04  mag in @xmath8 and @xmath12 .",
    "the exponential curves predict a much higher probability of large magnitude changes than the gaussian curves , and the data follow this prediction ( we only show the data for bins with more than 10 points ) .",
    "the data points become increasingly unreliable in the tails of each distribution due to small sample sizes , and this fact may cause the large discrepancy with the exponential curve for small @xmath28 in the @xmath10 and @xmath12 bands .",
    "figure  [ dmhistobs ] shows the differential  distributions for each sdss band and for two slices of observed - frame time lag .",
    "the distribution width ( i.e. , the sf value ) increases with time lag and decreases with wavelength .",
    "the wings of the distributions are also closer to exponential ( more accurately , a double - exponential or laplace dis- +    tribution ) than to gaussian .",
    "figure  [ dchistobs ] shows similar distributions for the changes in color for two slices in time lag .",
    "the color changes are smaller than for the individual magnitudes at the same time separation . in the bottom six panels ,",
    "the color changes are plotted against each other as well as against the @xmath10-band differences .",
    "although the scatter around these relationships is quite large , quasars tend to get bluer as they brighten on average ( bottom four panels ) , in accordance with previous results ( e.g. , giveon et al.1999 ) .",
    "an analogous correlation was found recently by schmidt et al.(2011 ) , who analyzed individual light curves .",
    "their study showed the slope @xmath29 between the @xmath10-band and @xmath9-band variations , as in @xmath30 , is on average around @xmath31 , indicating that quasars get bluer as they brighten .",
    "this value corresponds to a slope of 4 in the bottom - right panel of figure  [ dchistobs ] ( equating @xmath32 to ) , shown by the solid line , which approximately follows the observed , two - epoch distribution .",
    "next , we quantify the quasar variability using a sf analysis .",
    "although several definitions can be found in the literature , the sf essentially measures the rms magnitude difference as a function of time lag between magnitude measurements .",
    "we compute the structure function as @xmath33 where iqr is the 25%  75% interquartile range of the @xmath34 distribution , and @xmath35 is the number of  values .",
    "this approach is insensitive to outliers in the data which may result from poor data quality and is especially effective at short time lags where the sf is small .",
    "this value is equivalent to the rms if the distribution is gaussian . when stated , the photometric errors are taken into account by subtracting @xmath36 in quadrature from the sf .",
    "two other definitions of the sf are found in the literature . following bauer et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , we refer to them as sf@xmath37 and sf@xmath38 : @xmath39 @xmath40 for a gaussian distribution , the ratio of the form adopted here to the other two forms is @xmath41 , while for an exponential ( laplace ) distribution , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",

    "a model @xmath27 value is drawn from a gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of sf@xmath73 , the gaussian distribution expected from the drw model . to account for photometric errors ,",

    "this procedure results in one model  value per quasar based on the expectations from the drw model .",
    "we then repeat this 1000 times for each quasar in the sample .",

    "the observed distribution is very similar to the model distribution ( solid line ) , in which each quasar is assigned a model @xmath27 value drawn from a particular sf@xmath73 , as described above . the exponential distribution for large @xmath92 results from a superposition of many gaussians ( dashed lines ) corresponding to different values of sf@xmath73 .",
    "the range in sf@xmath73 is caused by differing @xmath5 and sf@xmath71 values , which can be attributed to a range in quasar luminosity and black hole mass plus intrinsic scatter .",

    "the observed and predicted sf@xmath73 values ( @xmath93 ) are listed to the right and left of each histogram , respectively .",
    "the model and data distributions agree well , showing that _ the exponential distributions seen in the statistics of ensembles of quasars naturally result from averaging over quasars that are individually well - described by a gaussian drw process .",
    "_ there are two systematic discrepancies , however .",
    "first , while the exponential tails can be reproduced at large rest - frame time lags ( @xmath94 days ) , the value of the observed sf is systematically higher . since there are no known intrinsic differences in the physical properties of the s82 quasars and the two - epoch sample studied here , the discrepancy is likely due to biases in estimates of the drw variability parameters for the s82 quasars .",
    "secondly , at small time lags ( @xmath95 days ) , the model over - predicts the data rms by 10% , while the statistical uncertainty is 1% assuming a perfect gaussian distribution of  and no other systematic errors . this discrepancy may be due to some systematic effect that was not accounted for when computing the error bars ( or when correcting forthe sdss photometric errors ) .",
    "alternatively , the discrepancy could result if the drw model is inaccurate on these time scales ( 1200 days ) .",
    "these discrepancies are discussed further in section  [ compare ] .",
    "now that we understand and can reproduce the shape of the distribution of magnitude changes  between two times , we can simply consider the sf ( i.e. , the width of this  distribution ) as a function of physical quantities such as @xmath51 and @xmath52 and test the model prediction .",
    "figure  [ sfdt ] shows the sf as a function of @xmath51 . here ,",
    "the measured sf is not corrected for the sdss photometric accuracy .",
    "again , it is apparent that the model predicts a systematically lower sf for time lags less than 200 days .",
    "however , the stochastic model predicts a systematically higher sf for the longest time lags . this suggests the model sf may be biased low at long time lags , and the bias seems to be most prominent at shorter wavelengths ( figure  [ sfw ] ) .",
    "note    that the measurements at long rest - frame time lags and short rest wavelengths are dominated by the @xmath8 band , so there may be biases simply from the fact that the 14% of @xmath8 and @xmath12 light curves which were dominated by noise were omitted from the analysis in mac10 .",
    "we investigate such biases further in section  [ compare ] .    in figure",
    "[ cellmedianpanel ] , we show the observed ensemble sf without correction for the sdss photometric errors .",
    "we also show the signal - to - noise ratio for each bin ( top - right panel ) . in the bottom - left panel ,",
    "we show the model expectation including the estimated photometric errors .",
    "the bottom - right panel shows the ( data    model ) residuals .",
    "overall , the results are excellent , with a median difference of only 0.02  mag and a median absolute difference of 0.03  mag .",
    "we see a slight decrement at @xmath96  days in the residuals at wavelengths coincident with the 2800  mgii emission line .",
    "this decrement is expected based on the results of reichert et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , where the mgii emission line is less variable and lags the continuum fluctuations by almost 10 days . in figure",
    "[ fig : resdip ] , the time axis is collapsed onto the wavelength axis ( using the weighted mean ) so that the dip in the residuals is emphasized . due to the excellent sdss photometry and large sample size",
    ", we are able to resolve this feature .",
    "note that the large width of the decrement may be due to the fact that the rest wavelengths are approximated from the fixed effective wavelengths of the sdss bands .",
    "not accounting for the variation of the effective wavelength with the shape and redshift of the quasar spectrum sampled limits the accuracy of the approximated rest wavelengths .",
    "thus , any line feature will be weakened and smoothed by the broad bandpasses of the sdss filters .",
    "the exponential distribution analysis in section  [ rf ] is sensitive to both sf@xmath71 and @xmath5 through the better determined combination defined by @xmath97 .",
    "however , for the long - term sdss ",
    "poss data , the  distribution is mainly sensitive to sf@xmath71 or @xmath5 at fixed @xmath87 .",
    "it is then of interest to see whether the  distribution remains exponential at large @xmath92 and if we can reproduce the ensemble sf ( ) on these long time scales .",
    "therefore , we repeat the analysis in section  [ rf ] using the 81,189 sdss quasars that are also observed in dposs .",
    "we only use the dposs data for the  analysis because the errors for poss - i are significantly larger . after applying the data quality cuts",

    "figure  [ fig : epochs ] shows the distribution of time lags in the observed and rest frames .",
    "dposs  distributions are shown in figure  [ fig : dmhistrestframe_poss ] . due to the larger photometric errors , these distributions appear more gaussian than those restricted to sdss observations . in some panels ,",
    "the peak is also offset from zero towards positive  values .",
    "this is likely due to the malmquist - like bias discussed in dv05 , where many objects that were fainter at the time of the dposs observation were then lost and not included . in general , the model curves ( solid lines ) are able to reproduce the shape of the distributions but underestimate the rms , even when accounting for the estimated photometric errors of @xmath98  mag .    finally , figure  [ sfall ] shows the sf over a large range of rest - frame time lag , including the sdss ",
    "poss data as measured in ses06 .",
    "we find an overall characteristic time scale of @xmath99  days with @xmath100  mag .",
    "note that in dv05 , the sf reaches @xmath101  mag at 40 years in the rest frame for the @xmath9 and @xmath10 bands combined .      in figure  [ sfall ]",
    ", we show our model sf as described in section  [ model ] .",
    "we again see that the model is biased to higher values of the sf between 1 and 200  days .",
    "we attribute this discrepancy to one or both of the following :    1 .   at short , the errors in our",
    "measured sf are underestimated , and some source of systematic error , such as an inaccurate correction for sdss photometric errors , causes the measured sf to appear smaller than what the model predicts .",
    "the drw model is inaccurate at short  and therefore overpredicts the ensemble sf .",
    "however , this is unlikely given that the results using stripe 82 light curves as well as densely - sampled ogle light curves ( zu et al .",
    "2012 ) show the drw model to be a good fit on time scales between 5 and 200 days .",
    "nevertheless , our measured slope of the sf seems well - constrained .",
    "we again see that beyond 200  days , the model is biased to lower values of the sf .",
    "the difficulty to exactly reproduce the long - term variability amplitudes suggests that the distributions of long - term amplitudes and/or time scales used in our model underestimate the true distributions .",
    "this bias may result from the following :    1 .   a bias in the measured @xmath5 ( and thus sf@xmath71 ) values for s82 quasars due to insufficient light curve lengths . since @xmath102",
    ", @xmath86 is the most strongly constrained quantity on time scales shorter than @xmath5 .",
    "that is , on a grid of @xmath103 versus @xmath104 , the best - fit values will be scattered due to fitting errors along lines of constant @xmath87 , but much less perpendicular to it ( i.e. , along lines of constant @xmath105 ) .",
    "therefore , as the light curve length decreases , the mean best - fit @xmath87 will not vary significantly , while the best - fit parameters @xmath5 , @xmath106 , and @xmath89 will become biased ( see koz10 ; mac10 ; macleod et al .",
    "2 .   a bias in the deterministic model ( eq .  [ eq : form ] ) . due to the finite length of the s82 survey ,",
    "22% of the s82 sample was excluded from the analysis in mac10 due to indeterminately long time scales . in this case , the measured parameters @xmath5 and sf@xmath71 are accurate for the remaining 78% of the s82 sample , but eq .  [ eq : form ] is only accurate for the lower values of @xmath5 ( @xmath107 ) and sf@xmath71 from which the correlations are derived .    in principle , both effects will lead to lower overall @xmath5 and sf@xmath71 in the distributions for s82 quasars , which will in turn cause the model ensemble sf to flatten at @xmath108  days as seen here .",
    "indeed , the excluded 22% of the sample will mostly contribute power to the long - term rather than the short - term sf given their indeterminately long time scales . however , when simply including an additional population of long-@xmath5 objects to fill in the missing 22% , we are unable to quantitatively reproduce the last sdss data point at @xmath109  days unless all the additional objects have @xmath110  days in the rest frame ( while keeping the same distribution of @xmath87 as observed ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if we double all the @xmath5 values in our model ( instead of adding an extra population of quasars at long @xmath5 ) , while keeping @xmath87 fixed so that the sf@xmath71 values are multiplied by @xmath70 , we are able to reproduce the observed long - term sf , as shown by the agreement between the green lines in figures  [ sfall ] and [ sfdt ] to the data points at long @xmath51 . in summary , the best - fit @xmath111 coefficients from eq .  [ eq : form ] need to be altered upwards by 0.15 dex in the case of sf@xmath71 , and by 0.30 dex in the case of @xmath5 , in order to explain the long time scale constraints provided by the sdss ",

    "at least half of these corrections can be understood as due to a fitting bias towards shorter @xmath5 ( see figure  7 in mac10 and figure  15 in macleod et al .",
    "another effect could be due to uncertain behavior for long time scales .",

    "we also show the best - fit broken power law to our data with the break fixed to 42 days , and we find power law indices at short and long  of 0.53 and 0.40 , respectively . while our 2-epoch sdss data are consistent with the shallower slope of 0.33 , our results do not support the conclusion of a much steeper sf ( ) for small  found by voevodkin ( 2011 ) for either the s82 or 2-epoch data sets .",
