    "a fascinating issue in general relativity and string theory is to study time - dependent brane solutions .",
    "the time evolution of them is intimately related to the d - brane dynamics in string theory and also there are some potential applications to cosmology and black hole physics .",
    "we are concerned here with colliding brane solutions .",
    "the original colliding brane solutions have been found by gibbons _ et al_. @xcite . for some generalizations of the solutions , see .",
    "a remarkable point is that the solutions are time - dependent but still exact and analytic .",
    "the colliding brane solutions are constructed basically by generalizing static brane solutions in supergravities . as a general property ,",
    "the solutions give rise to friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universes typically by regarding a homogeneous and isotropic part of the solution as our four - dimensional spacetime .",
    "also , some colliding solutions may provide black holes in a frw universe when three of the transverse directions to the d - branes are regarded as the three spatial directions of our world .",
    "although the colliding brane solutions have interesting aspects , there are some problems . as a feature of the colliding solutions , for example , a warp factor in the metric",
    "is a linear function of time for a nontrivial dilaton .",
    "hence , even in the case of the fastest expansion , the power is too small to exhibit a realistic expansion law as in the matter dominated era or in the radiation dominated era .",
    "a possible resolution is to include some additional matter fields .    as another application of time - dependent solutions",
    ", one may consider condensed matter systems .",
    "an example is a lifshitz point @xcite .",
    "the static solutions dual to a lifshitz point have originally been shown in @xcite .",
    "the embedding of them into string theory has been carried out in @xcite .",
    "there exist d3-brane solutions that give rise to the lifshitz space as a near - horizon geometry @xcite . in the previous work @xcite ,",
    "we have considered a time - dependent generalization of the solution found in @xcite . then dynamical lifshitz - type solutions @xcite have been constructed with a compactification @xcite .",
    "the solutions describe the time evolution from the lifshitz space to an ads space and it may be interpreted as an aging phenomenon in condensed matter systems .    in this paper , we first generalize the d3-brane solutions constructed in @xcite to _ multicenter _ d3-brane solutions with",
    "_ multiple _ waves .",
    "then we consider a t - dual picture of the generalized d3-brane solutions ( without the compactification to the lifshitz space ) . with a slight extension ,",
    "we obtain a brane system composed of dynamical f - strings intersecting d2-branes . in the six - dimensional space transverse to both f - strings and d2-branes (",
    "called the overall transverse space ) , the positions of the d2-branes are fixed at some points while f - strings are dynamical and tend to approach each other with time .",
    "in general , a singularity appears before collision .",
    "an exceptional case is that the f - string charges are the same and five directions of the overall transverse space are smeared out .",
    "we also discuss some cosmological aspects of the solutions towards building a realistic cosmological model .",
    "the possible models are classified based on compactifications of the internal space .",
    "all of them give rise to the frw universe with a power - law expansion .",

    "section [ conclusion ] is devoted to conclusion and discussion .",
    "let us present time - dependent d3-brane solutions with multicenters and multiple waves in type iib supergravity .    we restrict ourselves to the solutions that contain the dilaton @xmath2 , the axion @xmath3 and the self - dual five - form field strength @xmath4 .",
    "then the relevant field equations are given by here @xmath5 is the hodge operator in ten dimensions .",
    "now let us suppose the following ansatz : the two - dimensional metric @xmath6 and the six - dimensional metric @xmath7 depend only on @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively",
    ". then @xmath10 and @xmath11 are constant .",
    "the volume two - form @xmath12 is given by the constant @xmath11 is interpreted as the momentum of wave on the d3-branes in our later discussion .",
    "the above ansatz reduces the field equations to the following form : where @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the laplace operators on y and z spaces , respectively .",
    "from now on , we shall focus upon a special case by imposing the conditions , where @xmath15 , @xmath16 are the two- , six - dimensional euclidean metric , respectively .    then , by solving the field equations , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are given by where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are constant parameters ; @xmath25 is the asymptotic string coupling constant ; @xmath26 is the string length , related to the string tension @xmath27 as @xmath28 ; @xmath29 is the radius of @xmath30 ; and @xmath31 is the volume of y. here @xmath32 are masses of traveling waves located at @xmath33 and @xmath34 are masses of d3-branes located at @xmath35 and the @xmath30 direction is compact with period @xmath36 .",
    "the distances in the six - dimensional space with @xmath37 are defined as the solutions with ( [ d3p : solution - w : eq ] ) and ( [ d3p : solution - h : eq ] ) describe @xmath38-center d3-branes with @xmath39 waves .",
    "the directions along which the d3-branes and the waves extend are listed in table [ d3p ] .",
    "the time - dependent d3-brane solutions found in @xcite correspond to the case with @xmath40 .",
    "it is worth noting a relation to other solutions by considering a special case of the solution with ( [ d3p : solution - w : eq ] ) and ( [ d3p : solution - h : eq ] ) .",
    "let us impose the conditions , then we can obtain simpler solutions given by @xcite here @xmath42 is a constant parameter .",
    "the positions of wave and d3-branes are represented by @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "then the distance in the two - dimensional space with @xmath45 and @xmath46 is defined as thus the solutions with ( [ d3p : solution - w : eq ] ) and ( [ d3p : solution - h : eq ] ) can be regarded as a generalization of the solution found in @xcite .",
    "we shall consider a t - dual picture of the solutions presented in sec .  [ wave ] .",
    "the t - dualized solutions describe a brane system which consists of dynamical f - strings intersecting d2-branes .",
    "we also discuss collision of f - strings and the near - horizon geometries .",
    "the starting point is the d3-brane solutions with ( [ d3p : solution - w : eq ] ) and ( [ d3p : solution - h : eq ] ) . to perform a t - duality along the @xmath30 direction",
    ", we have to set @xmath47 .",
    "hence @xmath48 does not depend on @xmath30 .",
    "the t - duality relations from type iib to type iia are given by @xcite where @xmath30 is the coordinate to which the t - duality is performed .",
    "the indices @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 denote the other coordinates .    with the relations in ( [ t :",
    "duality : eq ] ) , the type iia metric is given by here @xmath52 is the ten - dimensional metric with the einstein frame",
    ". then @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the neveu - schwarz - neveu - schwarz two - form , the ramond - ramond ( rr ) one - form and the rr three - form , respectively",
    ". the field strengths of them are defined as @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the resulting metric describes a brane system composed of dynamical f - strings intersecting d2-branes .",
    "the directions along which the f - strings and the d2-branes extend are listed in table [ d2f1 ] .",
    "let us check the equations of motion as a consistency check and consider a further generalization .",
    "first of all , the bianchi identities for @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are automatically satisfied due to the t - duality relations in ( [ t : duality : eq ] ) .",
    "then the equation of motion for @xmath59 is decomposed into a set of the five equations as follows : note that the second and the fourth equations in ( [ t : h3 - 1:eq ] ) are trivially satisfied because there is no @xmath30 dependence now .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath60 is reduced to where @xmath12 and @xmath62 denote the volume forms , defined as    now that @xmath63 is assumed , the condition ( [ t : f2:eq ] ) leads to the constraint @xmath41 .",
    "this means that @xmath64 .",
    "this is consistent with the equation of motion for @xmath59 given in ( [ t : h3:eq ] ) . finally ,",
    "from the field equation for @xmath61 , we obtain the following equation :    let us suppose that @xmath65 .",
    "then , from ( [ t : h3 - 2:eq ] ) , we obtain the relation , @xmath66 .",
    "the solutions of @xmath18 and @xmath17 are given by , respectively , here the lengths are defined in ( [ d3p : z : eq ] ) , and the volume of five - sphere with the unit radius is given by @xmath67 .",
    "the parameters @xmath22 are constant",
    ". then @xmath32 and @xmath68 are mass parameters of f - strings and d2-branes , respectively . the f - strings ( d2-branes )",
    "are located at @xmath69 (  @xmath35 ) .",
    "note that we allowed the solution @xmath17 ( [ t : hw : eq ] ) to depend on @xmath30 again .",
    "in fact , this generalization is possible .",
    "the second and the fourth equations in ( [ t : h3 - 1:eq ] ) are also satisfied .",
    "thus we will discuss a t - dual picture of the d3-brane solutions with a slight generalization .",
    "let us next see the behavior of the solutions with ( [ t : hw : eq ] ) and ( [ t : h : eq ] ) .",
    "first of all , the solutions are time - dependent .",
    "it is obvious from the expression of the metric . by putting @xmath17 ( [ t : hw : eq ] ) into the metric ( [ t",
    ": metric : eq ] ) , the following metric is obtained : where the function @xmath70 is defined by the time dependence appears through the function @xmath17 .",
    "hence the next task is to study the time evolution of the solutions carefully .",
    "here we shall consider it by focusing upon collision of f - strings .    here",
    ", in order to decrease the number of transverse dimensions to d2-f1 brane effectively , let us smear out some of the directions in the z space .",
    "when the number of the smeared direction is given by @xmath71 , the functions @xmath70 and @xmath18 are rewritten as , respectively , hereafter , we will use the smeared solutions .",
    "let us see here the asymptotic behavior of the solutions",
    ". the harmonic function @xmath70 dominates in the limit of @xmath72 ( near a position of f - strings ) and the time dependence can be ignored .",
    "thus the system becomes static . on the other hand , in the limit of @xmath73",
    ", @xmath70 vanishes .",
    "then @xmath17 depends only on time @xmath74 in the far region from f - strings and the resulting metric is given by    the metric becomes singular at @xmath75 or @xmath76 .",
    "therefore the spacetime is regular when it is restricted inside the domain specified by the conditions , here the function @xmath70 is defined in ( [ t : w2 - 2:eq ] ) .",
    "the spacetime can not be extended beyond this region because the spacetime evolves into a curvature singularity .",
    "note that the regular spacetime with two f - strings ends up with the singular hypersurfaces .",
    "the dynamics of the spacetime depends on the signature of @xmath20 .",
    "the system with @xmath77 has the time reversal one of @xmath78 . in the following",
    ", we will study the case with @xmath78 .",
    "then the function @xmath17 is positive everywhere for @xmath79 and the spacetime is nonsingular . in the limit of @xmath80 , the solution is approximately described by a time - dependent uniform spacetime ( apart from a position of branes , near which the geometry takes a cylindrical form of infinite throat ) .",
    "let us study the time evolution for @xmath81 .",
    "at the initial time @xmath82 , the spacetime is regular everywhere and has a cylindrical topology near each brane .",
    "as time slightly goes , a curvature singularity appears as @xmath83 .",
    "the singular hypersurface cuts off more and more of the space as time goes further .",
    "when @xmath74 continues to increase , the singular hypersurface eventually splits and surrounds each of the f - string throats individually .",
    "the spatial surface is composed of two isolated throats . for @xmath79 , the time evolution of the spacetime",
    "is the time reversal of @xmath81 .    for any values of",
    "fixed @xmath84 in the regular domain , the metric ( [ t : sufrace2:eq ] ) implies that the overall transverse space tends to expand asymptotically like @xmath85 .",
    "thus , the solutions describe static intersecting brane systems composed of f - strings and d2-branes near the positions of the branes . on the other hand , in the far region as @xmath86 ) , the solutions approach frw universes with the power law expansion @xmath85 . the emergence of frw universes is an important feature of the dynamical brane solutions .",
    "we shall argue whether two f - strings can collide or not .",
    "we put the two f - strings at @xmath87 and @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is a constant parameter .",
    "in addition , we suppose that @xmath39 d2-branes are sitting at a point , namely @xmath90 and introduce the total mass of the @xmath39 d2-branes as @xmath91 it is helpful to introduce the following quantity : then the proper distance at @xmath92 between the two f - strings is represented by this is a monotonically decreasing function of time . here",
    "@xmath42 is the mass of the d2-brane .",
    "the behavior of the proper distance is different depending on the number of the smeared directions @xmath71 .",
    "we shall consider it for each of the values of @xmath71 below .",
    "let us consider the case with @xmath93 .",
    "the proper distance is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] for the cases with @xmath94 ( left ) and @xmath95 ( right ) .",
    "both plots mean that a singularity appears before the proper distance becomes zero .",
    "hence the singularity between two f - strings develops before collision .",
    "the two f - strings approach very slowly , and then the singular hypersurface suddenly appears at a finite distance . after that , the spacetime splits into two isolated brane throats",
    ". therefore one can not see collision of the f - strings in these examples .",

    "the solutions can also be obtained from supersymmetric static solutions by replacing a constant in the harmonic function with a linear function of time .",
    "this procedure is applicable universally to construct a class of time - dependent brane solutions .",
    "it is worth commenting on the time dependence of the solutions .",
    "the solutions admit f - strings to be dynamical , but d2-branes have to be static .",
    "the origin of this restriction is that the ansatz we imposed is too restrictive .",
    "in fact , in recent works on similar systems , both harmonic functions may depend on time @xcite .",
    "we have also discussed collision of f - strings .",
    "two f - strings approach each other with time .",
    "in general , a singularity appears before collision .",
    "an exceptional case is that five directions in the overall transverse space are smeared out .",
    "the dynamical solutions give rise to a singularity when @xmath186 .",
    "the appearance of the singularity indicates the two possibilities : ( 1 ) the ansatz is simply wrong or ( 2 ) just the supergravity approximation is not valid and it is necessary to include some stringy corrections from @xmath187 or @xmath25 .",
    "it is difficult to decide which of them applies to the present case only from the supergravity perspective",
    ". it would be interesting to consider some generalizations to include stringy corrections .",
    "we have also argued cosmological models obtained from the solutions by compactifying the internal space . the resulting frw universes exhibit a power - law expansion .",
    "however , the power of the scale factor is less than @xmath188 and hence it is too small to realize a realistic expansion . to obtain a realistic expanding universe such as an inflationary scenario or matter or a radiation dominated era",
    ", we have to include additional matter fields .",
    "thus it is interesting to try to construct a cosmological model by studying a more complicated setup .",
    "after all , the solutions constructed here do not give a realistic cosmological model .",
    "however , we believe that more elaborated construction along this line would open a new window to realize realistic cosmological expansions in the context of string theory .                                                                        c.  p.  burgess , c.  nunez , f.  quevedo , g.  tasinato and i.  zavala , `` general brane geometries from scalar potentials : gauged supergravities and accelerating universes , '' jhep * 0308 * ( 2003 ) 056 [ hep - th/0305211 ] ."
