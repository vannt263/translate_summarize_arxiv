    "2009 , hereafter ds09 ; plotkin et al .",
    "2010 ) . by virtue of their largely featureless spectra",
    ", the redshifts of these sources can be determined reliably only from the onset of the ly@xmath5 forest or the presence of a lyman limit system .",
    "subsequent multiwavelength observations of several sources of this class have shown that they are unlikely to be high - redshift galaxies with apparent quasar - like luminosities due to gravitational lensing amplification , dust - obscured quasars , or broad - absorption line quasars ( e.g. , shemmer et al .  2006 ;",
    "ds09 ) . furthermore , based on their relative radio and  weakness , shemmer et al .",
    "( 2009 , hereafter s09 ) have argued against the possibility that such sources may be the long - sought , high - redshift bl lacertae objects ( e.g. , stocke & perrenod 1981 ; see also ds09 ) .",
    "instead , s09 suggested that these sources are unbeamed quasars with extreme properties .",
    "high - redshift quasars with weak or undetectable uv emission lines ( hereafter weak - emission line quasars , or wlqs ) are defined as quasars having rest - frame equivalent widths ( ews ) of for the emission - line complex ( ds09 ) .",
    "this ew threshold marks the @xmath6 limit at the low - ew end for the ew distribution in a sample of @xmath7 sdss quasars at @xmath8 with no broad absorption lines . instead of the @xmath9 quasars",
    "statistically expected to lie below this threshold ( assuming the ew distribution is lognormal ) , 56 wlqs are included in that sample , and there is no corresponding excess of ` strong - lined ' quasars beyond the @xmath6 limit at the high - ew end ( ds09 ) .",
    "the reason for this excess of quasars with extremely weak uv emission lines is not yet understood .",
    "spectroscopic monitoring of four wlqs further suggests that it is unlikely that the weakness of their lines can be explained by microlensing that temporarily and preferentially amplifies the continuum relative to the broad - emission lines ( ds09 ) .",
    "this result supports the idea that the uv emission lines in wlqs are intrinsically weak .",
    "intrinsically weak uv emission lines in quasars may be a consequence of a peculiar continuum - source spectral energy distribution ( sed ) that has a relative deficiency in high - energy photons .",
    "for example , a combination of large black - hole mass ( @xmath10 ) and extremely high accretion rate may result in a relatively narrow , uv - peaked sed ( e.g. , leighly et al .",
    "2007a , b ; vasudevan & fabian 2007 ) .",
    "in such a scenario , prominent high - ionization emission lines , such as , are suppressed relative to low - ionization emission lines such as h@xmath1 , which are not affected to the same extent .",
    "the peculiar spectral properties of the nearby , high - accretion rate quasar  may be explained by this effect .",
    "this quasar exhibits ( within the range observed for wlqs ; ds09 ) , while h@xmath1 , for example , has a more typical , but still relatively weak , quasar value of ( leighly et al .",
    "at least one additional quasar at , e.g. , (;",
    "mcdowell et al .  1995 ) , may also be similar to .",
    "alternatively , wlqs may have abnormal broad - emission line region ( belr ) properties such as a significant deficit of line - emitting gas in the belr or a low belr covering factor . in this scenario ,",
    "their low - ionization emission lines are expected to be weak as well .",
    "it has also been suggested that the belrs in wlqs may be in an early stage of formation ( hryniewicz et al .",

    "the widths of the narrow gaussians were tied to the same value and the [ ] lines were constrained to have the theoretical ratio .",
    "the emission template was broadened by convolving it with a gaussian profile whose width was free to vary within the velocity range used for the broad h@xmath1 .",
    "our fitting results are summarized in table  [ properties ] , where error bars are given at a 90% confidence level , and the best - fit models appear in fig.[niri_spectra ] .",
    "upper limits on were determined by assuming a gaussian profile with embedded in random noise at the observed signal - to - noise level ( @xmath26 ) and looking for the weakest such feature that would have been detected in our spectra ( see , e.g. , shemmer et al .",
    "2004 ) .    in both sources we detect unusually weak broad h@xmath1  lines as well as prominent emission ( cf . netzer & trakhtenbrot 2007 ) .",
    "since [ ] lines are undetected , we consider the centroids of the best - fit h@xmath1  lines for determining the systemic redshifts of the sources ( table  [ log ] ) .",
    "these redshifts are larger by than those determined from the sdss spectra ( ds09 ) .",
    "this indicates that the sdss redshift determination may be biased towards somewhat lower values , since the onset of the ly@xmath5 forest is not easily detectable at .",
    "the rest - frame spectra in fig .",
    "[ sdss_spectra ] were corrected by @xmath28 .",
    "we note that the broadening of the templates required gaussian profiles that are significantly narrower than those of their corresponding h@xmath1  lines ( table  [ properties ] ) , which is not uncommon if most of the emission is considered to originate in an ` intermediate - line region ' ( e.g. , hu et al .",

    "( 2007 ) whose luminosities are comparable to those of our wlqs .",
    "the sources from the comparison sample all have ; the maximum is and the mean is .",
    "thus , our two wlqs lie at the tail of an ew(h@xmath1 ) distribution for high - redshift quasars , although this result is not as significant as the deviation of wlqs from the lognormal distribution of in high - redshift quasars (  [ introduction ] ) .",
    "we obtained  imaging spectroscopy of with _ xmm - newton _  ( jansen et al .",
    "2001 ) on 2008 june 27 ( dataset ) .",
    "the data were processed using standard _ xmm - newton _  science analysis system v8.0.0 tasks .",
    "the event files were filtered in time to remove periods of flaring activity in which the count rates of each mos ( pn ) detector exceeded 0.35 ( 1.0 ) for events having ; the net exposure times were 19.7  ks and 16.7  ks for the mos1/mos2 and pn detectors , respectively . for each detector ,",
    "source counts were extracted using a circular aperture with centered on the source , and background counts were extracted from a nearby source - free region that was at least as large as the corresponding source region .",
    "the spectrum from each detector was grouped with a minimum of 20 counts per bin .",
    "the net source counts in the band were 81 , 128 , and 333 for the mos1 , mos2 , and pn detectors , respectively .",
    "joint spectral fitting of the data from all three detectors was performed with ( arnaud 1996 ) , considering only observed - frame energies above 0.44kev .",
    "this energy range corresponds to rest - frame energies above 2kev , where the underlying power - law hard  spectrum is less prone to contamination due to any potential absorption or soft excess emission .",
    "we fitted the spectrum with a power - law model and a galactic - absorption component , which was kept fixed during the fit with a column density of obtained from dickey & lockman ( 1990 ) .",
    "the power - law model consisted of a single photon index for all three detectors , while the power - law normalizations were free to vary .",

    "the  spectrum and its best - fit model and residuals appear in figure  [ xmm_spectrum ] . based on an",
    ", we find that adding an intrinsic , neutral - absorption component to the above model does not improve the fit significantly and hence is not warranted by our data .",
    "the upper limit on the column density of such intrinsic neutral - absorption component is ( at 90% confidence ) .",
    "finally , we do not detect  variability between the _ xmm - newton _  and shallow _ chandra _  observations of this source reported in s09 .",
    "we find that at least two wlqs exhibit extremely weak uv as well as h@xmath1  emission lines that place them at the tail of the corresponding ew distributions in type  1 agn .",
    "on the other hand , a wealth of multiwavelength observations of a sub - set of wlqs have shown that , unlike their optical - uv emission - line properties , their broad - band continua are consistent with those observed in the general quasar population at the corresponding redshifts and luminosities ( e.g. , ds09 , s09 ) . such observations already question the leading hypothesis that wlqs are quasars with extremely high accretion rates ( i.e. , ) , which has been motivated mainly by the peculiar properties of  ( leighly et al .  2007a , b ;  [ introduction ] ) .",
    "this quasar shows unusually weak uv emission lines and it has , derived from an h@xmath1-based , virial determination of @xmath10 .",
    "the properties of  can also be viewed as an extreme case of the anticorrelation between uv - line ( e.g. , ) strength and @xmath3  ( baskin & laor 2004 ) .",
    "based on the very small ews ( or ew upper limits ) of wlqs ( ds09 ) , and assuming this anticorrelation extends to their relatively high luminosities , the implication is for all wlqs .",
    "such a range of @xmath3  constitutes the high - end tail of the @xmath3  distribution in @xmath29 sdss quasars ( shen et al .",
    "2008 ) , and this may be analogous to the excess of wlqs with respect to the lognormal distribution of uv - line ews in high - redshift quasars (   [ introduction ] ) .",
    "we determine virial @xmath10  and corresponding @xmath3  values for our wlqs from their derived optical properties ( tables  [ log ] and [ properties ] ) , utilizing the empirical belr size - luminosity relation of kaspi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) modified by bentz et al .",
    "this results in the following expressions for @xmath10  and @xmath3 :    @xmath30^{0.5}\\left[\\frac{{\\rm fwhm}({\\rm        h}\\beta)}{10 ^ 3\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}}\\right]^2\\ ] ]    @xmath31^{0.5}\\left[\\frac{{\\rm fwhm}({\\rm        h}\\beta)}{10 ^ 3\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}}\\right]^{-2},\\ ] ]    where we have employed equation  21 of marconi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) to obtain @xmath32 , the luminosity - dependent bolometric correction to , which is 5.7 for both sources .",
    "the resulting @xmath10  and @xmath3  values ( table  [ properties ] ) are well within the ranges observed in recent quasar surveys ( e.g. , shen et al .",
    "2008 ) , and there are no indications for extremely high accretion rates in our wlqs . in other words , although the @xmath10  uncertainty associated with a virial-@xmath10  determination is typically on the order of a factor of @xmath33 , given the luminosities of our wlqs , would imply ( according to eq .",
    "[ eq : lledd ] ) , which is significantly lower than observed .",
    "the weakness of the h@xmath1  lines in our wlqs , resulting in unusually high ratios in these sources ( thus implying extremely high @xmath3  values ; table  [ properties ] ) , may appear inconsistent with the rather ` normal ' @xmath3  values we derive ( e.g. , netzer et al .",
    "2004 ) . however , we note that several sources , mainly at , are known to have high ratios and yet have ( e.g. , netzer & trakhtenbrot 2007 ) .",
    "it is therefore possible that our wlqs constitute high - redshift outliers from the empirical anticorrelation of netzer et al .",
    "we note that the absence of [ ] emission lines in our wlqs is consistent with their high ratios ; furthermore , @xmath34% of high - redshift quasars have [ ] lines that are as weak as those we measure(netzer et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "another accretion rate indicator in luminous quasars is the slope of the hard-  spectrum ( e.g. , shemmer et al .  2008 ; risaliti et al .",
    "2009 ) . for",
    ", we measure a hard-  photon index of , which is typical of luminous , high - redshift rqqs .",

    "2008 ) , corrected for the belr size - luminosity relation used here . , for comparison , has ( leighly et al .",
    "2007a ) , consistent within the errors , with the prediction from this correlation given its .",
    "however , a more pronounced difference between  and lies in their seds , since the former has been found to be times  weaker than expected from its optical luminosity ( corresponding to deviation ; steffen et al .  2006 ; gibson et al .",
    "2008 ) while the latter is  _ brighter _ than expected by a factor of @xmath35 ( corresponding to deviation ; see s09 ) .",
    "the extreme  weakness of  has been attributed to its extremely high @xmath3  ( leighly et al .",
    "we find no  indication for unusually high @xmath3  in , consistent with the virial-@xmath10  determination .",
    "this result is consistent with the s09 findings in which there is no evidence of an exceptionally high photon index in a joint  spectral fit of  11  wlqs .",
    "based on the spectra of two wlqs , we find that the weakness of their emission lines is not a consequence of unusual continuum source properties . alternatively ,",
    "our results suggest that the weakness of both low- and high - ionization potential belr lines in our two wlqs may be a consequence of unusual belr physical properties . for example",
    ", weak ( or ` anemic ' ) belr lines across the spectrum may be due to gas deficit in the belr manifested by a low belr covering factor .",
    "we note that ` anemic ' emission - line regions in agns have also been suggested to be a result of exceptionally _ low _",
    "@xmath3   ( e.g. , nicastro 2000 ) , but this scenario does not apply to wlqs that are significantly more luminous than the so called ` optically - dull agn ' found mainly in the local universe ( e.g. , trump et al .",
    "the key to understanding the belr in wlqs is to investigate the relationship between their high- and low - ionization belr lines ( e.g. , and h@xmath1 ) by additional nir spectroscopy ( to measure low - ionization lines ) coupled with detailed photoionization modeling .",
    "we present new @xmath0-band spectra of two wlqs at and an _ xmm - newton _  spectrum of one of them . the @xmath0-band spectra allowed measurement of the spectral properties of the h@xmath1  lines and the emission complex , and the placement of tight upper limits on the strengths of the [ ] lines .",
    "the broad h@xmath1  lines in both sources are significantly weaker than those observed in typical quasars with similar luminosities and redshifts , but they still enable reliable determinations of @xmath10  and @xmath3 .",
    "the results of our and  spectra do not support the idea that the weakness of the high- as well as low - ionization belr lines in our two wlqs can be accounted for by extremely high accretion rates . instead",
