    "in recent years , there is an intensive interest in studying the casimir interactions between two objects due to the success in experimental verification of the casimir effect @xcite and the advent in the field theoretical method for computing the casimir interactions @xcite .",
    "the casimir interactions between spheres , between cylinders , between a plane and a sphere and between a plane and a cylinder , have been extensively studied . however , most of the studies only considered the zero temperature interactions .",
    "nevertheless , the finite temperature corrections have started to gain more attention recently @xcite . in this letter",
    ", we study the finite temperature casimir interaction between two concentric cylinders .",
    "the zero temperature casimir interaction between two concentric cylinders has been considered in @xcite .",
    "here we consider the finite temperature correction .",
    "of particular interest is the asymptotic behaviors of the casimir interaction when the separation between the spheres is small . in @xcite ,",
    "the asymptotic behavior at zero temperature has been obtained for two concentric perfectly conducting cylinders . here",
    "we would consider both scalar fields and electromagnetic fields with different combinations of boundary conditions , which include dirichlet - dirichlet ( dd ) , neumann - neumann ( nn ) , dirichlet - neumann ( dn  dirichlet on the smaller cylinder and neumann on the larger cylinder ) and neumann - dirichlet ( nd ) for scalar fields ; and perfectly conducting - perfectly conducting ( pc - pc ) and perfectly conducting - infinitely permeable ( pc - ip ) for electromagnetic fields .",
    "in fact , for cylinders , the results for electromagnetic fields can be easily derived from the results for scalar fields .",
    "consider two concentric cylinders with radii @xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "let @xmath1 be the separation between the cylinders . at zero temperature ,",
    "the casimir interaction energy between the two cylinders is given by @xcite : @xmath2where @xmath3 is the length of the cylinders and @xmath4with @xmath5depending on whether dirichlet or neumann condition is imposed on the cylinder with radius @xmath6 . here",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath8 are modified bessel functions .    using matsubara representation ,",

    "is the so - called high temperature expansion of the casimir free energy and is the so - called low temperature expansion .",
    "the latter shows manifestly the thermal correction to the casimir free energy , which is given by @xmath14    for electromagnetic field with perfectly conducting ( or infinitely permeable ) condition on both cylinders , the casimir free energy is the sum of the casimir free energies for dd and nn boundary conditions .",
    "if one cylinder is perfectly conducting and one is infinitely permeable , then the casimir free energy is the sum of the casimir free energies for dn and nd boundary conditions .    in the following ,",
    "we derive the asymptotic expansions of the casimir free energy when the separation between the cylinders is small compared to the radii of the cylinders .",
    "we consider the low temperature region where @xmath15 and the high temperature region where @xmath16 . in the low temperature region ,",
    "the dominating term of the casimir free energy is the zero temperature term , whereas in the high temperature region , the dominating term is the classical term : @xmath17 whose matsubara frequency is zero .",
