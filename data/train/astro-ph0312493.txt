    "accreting black holes in our galaxy show a large variety of x - ray properties , which can be classified into distinct spectral states ( tanaka & lewin 1995 ; mcclintock & remillard 2003 , hereafter mr03 ) . in the high / soft state ,",
    "typically seen at luminosities above @xmath2 per cent of eddington , the energy spectrum is dominated by a soft thermal component of temperature 0.4 1.5  kev .",
    "this is well described by the standard accretion model of emission from an optically thick and geometrically thin disc ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 , hereafter ss73 ) . where the source varies , the temperature and luminosity of this disc component change together in such a way as to indicate that the size of the emitting structure remains approximately constant i.e. @xmath0 ( ebisawa  1991 ; 1994 ; kubota , makishima & ebisawa 2001 ; kubota & makishima 2004 ; hereafter km04 ; gierlinski & done 2004 ; hereafter gd04 ) .",
    "excitingly , this gives an observable diagnostic of the mass and spin of the black hole , assuming that this constant size scale is set by the innermost stable orbit around the black hole .",
    "these results are actually very surprising in the context of the ss73 disc equations .",
    "the predicted disc structure is violently unstable at such luminosities , where radiation pressure dominates , yet these disc dominated spectra show very little short time - scale variability .",
    "also , the disc spectrum should _ not _ be a simple sum of blackbody spectra at these high temperatures , as electron scattering dominates over true absorption . in the x - ray band ,",
    "this difference in spectral shape can be roughly described as a standard disc spectrum , but of a higher temperature than the effective ( blackbody ) temperature ( shimura & takahara 1995 ; merloni et al .",
    "however , this colour temperature correction factor can change with luminosity , so is _ not _ predicted to produce a simple @xmath0 relation ( gd04 ) .",
    "real discs are then observed to be much simpler than the ss73 predictions , pointing to the inadequacies of the _ ad hoc _ @xmath3 viscosity prescription and motivating further studies of the disc structure which results from the physical ( magnetic dynamo ) viscosity mechanism in radiative discs ( e.g. turner 2004 ) .",
    "this observed simplicity is reserved only for the high / soft state data , where the disc spectrum is dominant .",
    "accreting black holes can also show a rather different type of spectrum at high luminosities , the so - called very high state termed the steep power - law state by mr03 ) , characterized by a very strong ( roughly ) power - law component ( miyamoto 1991 ) .",
    "this is normally steep , with photon spectral index @xmath4 , rather different to the standard low / hard state spectra seen usually at much lower luminosities ( e.g. the reviews by tanaka & lewin 1995 ; mr03 ) . in this very high state ,",
    "the constant area inferred from the relation between observed temperature and disc luminosity breaks down ( ebisawa 1994 ; kubota 2001 ; km04 ; mr03 ) .    to some extent",
    "this breakdown is expected .",
    "the strong high energy emission shows that a large fraction of the accretion energy is dissipated in some non - disc structure ( corona / jet ? ) , so the disc structure should be different to that seen when the emission is dominated by the thermal disc spectrum ( e.g. svensson & zdziarski 1994 ) .",
    "also , the intense x - rays may illuminate the disc , again changing its structure ( e.g.  nayakshin , kazanas & kallman 2000 ) .",
    "however , kubota et al ( 2001 ) showed that for very high state spectra where the high energy emission was less than @xmath5 per cent of the total flux ( which they termed the anomalous spectra ) , then the constancy of disc area could be ( approximately ) recovered by careful modelling of the spectrum , and by correcting the observed disc luminosity to include the compton scattered photons ( km04 ) .    here",
    "we investigate the extremely comptonised very high state spectra from the 1998 outburst of xte j1550 - 564 , where the steep power law tail dominates the total emission .",
    "this source has a superluminal jet ( hannikainen 2001 ) and is a confirmed black hole with mass of 8.411.2 @xmath6 , at a distance of 5  kpc and binary inclination angle of @xmath7 ( orosz  2002 ) .",
    "we show that these extremely comptonised very high spectra are qualitatively and quantitatively different to the spectra with a weaker comptonised tail .",
    "they are not easily compatible with a simple comptonising corona above an untruncated disc , though such a geometry may be possible with a complex corona , with strong radial gradients in the optical depth . however",
    ", the simplest solution is that the disc in these compton dominated spectra is truncated at larger radii than the minimum stable orbit around the black hole .",
    "the transient black hole binary xte  j@xmath1 was discovered on 1998 september 7 by _ rxte _ asm ( smith 1998 ) and _ cgro _ batse ( wilson 1998 ) .",
    "this source showed four subsequent outbursts since its discovery , but the first outburst was the brightest and best covered by _ rxte _ pointing observations .",
    "the data were analyzed by many authors including sobczak  ( 1999 ; 2000ab ) , wilson & done ( 2001 ) , homan ( 2001 ) , and km04 .",
    "figure  [ fig : asm ] shows the 1.512  kev light curve and hardness ratios of the first outburst , obtained with _ rxte _",
    "asm , together with the frequency of the main qpo ( where seen ) from remillard ( 2002 ) .",
    "clearly the source hardness changes dramatically during the outburst , as does the qpo frequency .",
    "these are generally correlated , so that spectral states can be defined either from spectral or power spectral characteristics ( van der klis 2000 ; mr03 ) .",
    "here we briefly summerise the main features of the source behaviour .",
    "the marked softening of the spectrum in the first 5 - 10 days after the source was detected is associated with a state transition from the low / hard state ( first five days ) into the very high state ( wilson & done 2000 ; cui 1999 ; sobczak 1999 ) . for about a month ( between days 552 : fig .  1 ) ,",
    "the source showed strong qpos and a strong hard spectral component ( e.g. , sobczak 2000a ) , so can be classified as in the very high state during the whole of this time .",
    "the qpo frequency changes quite dramatically during the first @xmath8 40 days of the outburst , but then stabilizes from day 40 - 52 .",
    "the type of qpo also changes at day 40 ( from c / c to b : see remillard  2002 ) .",
    "after the day 52 , the luminosity and hardness both decreased as the source made a transition to the classic high / soft disc dominated ( termed thermal dominated : mr03 ) state . generally the qpo is not seen , but when it is detected , it is of different type ( a , very weak : remillard 2002 ) to that seen previously .",
    "most of the time until the end of this first outburst , the source stayed in this disc dominated high / soft state as the luminosity changed , giving progressively higher / lower disc temperatures and so higher / lower hardness ratios .",
    "there is just one section ( days 180 - 200 ) where the hard power law flux again increased relative to the disc emission to a level comparable to that seen towards the end of the first very high state ( days 40 - 52 ) and where the qpos ( mainly type b ) reappear .",
    "hence homan ( 2001 ) identify these data as very high state .",
    "the luminosity and temperature of the disc component from day 40 onwards is always consistent with optically thick material extending down to the last stable orbit around the black hole ( km04 , see also figs 4b - d ) . in this paper , we concentrate our discussion on the very high state spectra where the coronal luminosity is @xmath9 50% of the total i.e. days 540 of the outburst",
    ". we will show that these data are most easily described if the inner disc does not extend down to the last stable orbit , as also indicated by the qpo frequency .",
    "hereafter , we distinguish these data from the other very high states in which the power law component is weaker ( days 4052 , 180200 ) , and call it the `` strong very high state '' . in table  [",
    "tab : name ] , we summarize the correspondence of the spectral states we used in this paper to the state defined in other literatures .",

    "good pca and hexte data were selected and processed , following the same procedures as in km04 and wd01 , respectively .",
    "for the pca data reduction we used top and mid layer from all available units , using standard exclusion criteria ( target elevation less than @xmath14 above the earth s limb , pointing direction was more than @xmath15 from the target , data acquired within 30 minutes after the spacecraft passage through south atlantic anomaly ) .",

    "the 320  kev data are used in this paper , since there is sometimes residual structure in the 2035 kev range associated with the xe - k edge at @xmath830  kev .",

    "since one detector on cluster 1 of the hexte has lost its spectral capability , we use only _ standard mode _ data from cluster 0 .",
    "the hexte background was subtracted by sequential rocking of the two clusters on and off of the source position .",
    "we used the software package called _ hxtback _ for splitting the data and the background .",
    "the hexte data below @xmath17  kev were not used in the spectral fit because of response uncertainties associated with the xe - k edge .",
    "systematic errors of 0.5% are also added to each spectral bin of the hexte , though these are much smaller than statistical errors of the hexte data in the range of 30200  kev so make no difference to the spectral fits .",

    "in order to briefly characterize the spectral behavior throughout the outburst , we performed spectral fitting to the 320  kev pca data with the canonical multicolour disc model ( hereafter mcd model , diskbb in xspec ; mitsuda 1984 ) plus a power - law model .",

    "fig : uspec ] ) , so details of how it is modeled become important .",
    "a power law approximation for the comptonised spectrum is inadequate , as real compton spectra show a low energy turnover close to the seed photon energy ( km04 ; done , zycki & smith 2002 ) .",
    "we replace the power law with a proper thermal comptonisation model ( thcomp in xspec : zdziarski , johnson & magdziarz 1996 ) which is parameterized by asymptotic power law index , @xmath25 , and electron temperature , @xmath21 .",
    "we assume that the seed photons are from the observed mcd component , so @xmath21 is the only additional free parameter compared to the previous power law fits .",
    "we use the pca and hexte data in order to better constrain @xmath21 , but this broad bandpass shows that the spectra are rather more complex than a single thermal comptonisation component ( and its reflected emission ) . while the data below 20 kev can be dominated by the disc and a cool thermal compton component , the higher energy data show a quasi - power law tail ( gierlinski 1999 ; zdziarski 2001 ; wd01 ; kubota 2001 ; gierlinski & done 2003 ; km04 ) .",
    "we follow km04 and model this additional component as a power law with photon index @xmath20 fixed at 2.0 which is the average index of the high energy emission in the standard high / soft state ( e.g. fits to hexte data : sobczak 2000b ) , and fit all the pca+hexte data with this three component continuum model ; mcd plus thermal comptonisation ( thcomp ) plus power law , with the gaussian line and smeared edge to mimic reflection .",
    "all the model parameters are constrained to be the same between the pca and the hexte data except for a normalization factor .",
    "this three component model successfully reproduced all the spectra , and the electron temperature of the comptonised component was found at 1030  kev in all the very high state data , except for that at the peak ( day 13 ) where the temperature is considerably higher at @xmath89  kev .",
    "this means that the thermal rollover in the spectrum is not so obvious in the pca - hexte bandpass .",
    "nonetheless , the complex continuum model ( thermal plus non - thermal ) is still strongly preferred by the data compared to a single comptonised component .",

    "fig : t - l]b ) .",
    "this looks very promising for models in which the disc structure remains rather stable in all the high state spectra , with constant apparent inner disc radius .",
    "however , the comptonised luminosity is indeed very large compared to that of the disc in the very high state , making it likely that the corona covers a fairly large fraction of the disc . in this case",
    "the corona is in the line of sight and intercepts some of the disc photons , so the observed disc luminosity underestimates the intrinsic disc luminosity , @xmath90 .",
    "the energy transfer by compton scattering can be characterised by the compton @xmath91 parameter , which is @xmath92 ( e.g. , rybicki & lightman 1979 ) .",

    "figure  [ fig : t - l]c shows this luminosity plotted against @xmath94 . as shown by km04 this puts the weak very high state ( anomalous regime ; days 4052 ) data onto the same constant radius line as the standard regime data , while the strong very high state lies significantly above these points .    for the strong very high state ,",
    "the compton energy boost is _ not _ negligible .",
    "instead , we estimate @xmath90 by conservation of photon number , as the photons in the comptonised spectrum came originally from scattering of seed photons from the disc .",

    "it is clear that the weak very high state ( anomalous regime ) data are now easily consistent with the same constant @xmath105 seen in the standard high / soft data , but the strong very high state , where the comptonised luminosity is more than @xmath5% of the total flux , are well above the line .",
    "this is _ highly unlikely _ to be due to a changing colour temperature correction , as it requires a _ smaller _ colour temperature correction than that in the standard high / soft state ( see  6 ) .",

    "we use the same three continuum component model and fitting conditions as above , except that the value of @xmath106 is now a free parameter .",

    "the best fit value of @xmath108  kev is much more tightly constrained , and its central value is slightly shifted to lower temperature than @xmath56  kev derived from the _ rxte _ data alone .    in order to check the results with a more physical model ,",
    "we replace the phenomenological line and smeared edge spectral features with the full reflection code included in the thcomp model ( zycki , done & smith 1998 ) .",
    "we fix the inclination and iron abundance at @xmath7 and solar abundance , respectively .",
    "these fit results are shown as model ( b ) in table  [ tab : asca - rxte ] .",
    "the derived reflection parameters look somewhat unphysical , with a large amount of mostly neutral reflection .",
    "this is probably due to limitations of the reflection modelling for an ionized disc in thcomp , which is based on the pexriv reflected continuum calculations ( magzdiarz & zdziarski 1995 ) .",
    "these codes calculate the ionisation balance in a very simplistic way ( done 1992 ) , assumming it to be constant throughout the disc rather than varying as a function of height ( nayakshin 2000 ; ballantyne , ross & fabian 2001 ) .",
    "another issue is that these models assume that compton upscattering is negligible below 12  kev .",
    "however , for ionised material this can be very important in determining the iron line and edge structure observed ( ross , fabian & young 1999 ) . while more accurate ionised reflection models are available for spectral fitting ( nayakshin et al .",
    "2000 ; ballantyne , iwasawa & ross 2001 ) , they assume a very simple continuum form ( power law , or power law with exponential cutoff ) which means they can not accurately describe the complex spectral shape observed in these very high state data .",
    "instead , we estimate the impact of this uncertainty in the reflection modelling by removing the iron line and edge region ( 512  kev ) and refitting the data with the thcomp reflected continuum with an ionization parameter , @xmath109 , fixed at @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 , ( models ( c ) , ( d ) and ( e ) respectively in table 2 ) .",

    "[ fig : t - l]b  d ) .",
    "these show the range of systematic uncertainties present from the spectral modelling . however , _ all _ of the fits detailed in table 2 have an even lower disc temperature than that derived from fits to the pca+hexte data , but with a similar luminosity .",
    "these show even more clearly that the strongly comptonised spectra are _ not _ easily consistent with an untruncated disc . for the simple corona geometries of fig .",
    "[ fig : geo1 ] , then in order to explain the high inferred intrinsic disc luminosity , @xmath114@xmath115 , with the same disc radius as seen in the standard high / soft state requires @xmath116  0.850.9  kev .",
    "by contrast , the 99.9% upper limits ( @xmath117 for dof of 186188 ) of the disc temperature from the asca - pca - hexte data is @xmath118  kev for all the models ( a  e ) in table 2 .",
    "fixing @xmath119  kev results in completely unacceptable fits ( @xmath120 = 4.65.6 ) .    more conservatively , even when the systematic errors of the pca data and the hexte data increased to 1  % , the 99.9  % upper limit is still lower than 0.69  kev . since deviations between the modeled and measured crab spectrum",
    "do not exceed 1  % as noticed by many authors including revnivtsev  ( 2003 ) , @xmath121  kev can be considered as the securest upper limit of the disc inner temperature .",
    "it is clear that the low disc temperature derived in the strong very high state spectra from the pca+hexte fits are _ not _ due to lack of pca coverage of the disc spectrum , or the spectral modelling of the reflection emission .",
    "we have shown that the strong very high state spectra really do have a rather low temperature disc for its luminosity .",
    "these observations suggest that the disc is truncated at larger radii than the last stable orbit in the strong very high state .",
    "however , this is based on the assumptions that ( 1 ) the correction factor of color to effective temperature is kept approximately constant , and ( 2 ) the corona fully covers the disc as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : geo1 ]      figure  [ fig : evolution2]c represents the time history of the apparent inner radius @xmath105 , as derived from the temperature and luminosity values given in fig .  [ fig : t - l]d .",
    "the true inner radius @xmath122 is related to @xmath105 as @xmath123 , where @xmath88 is the colour temperature correction . for constant @xmath88 , the observed variability of @xmath105",
    "is just caused by change of the inner radius .",
    "however , a change in the colour temperature correction could be expected as a function of disc luminosity ( merloni 2000 ; gd04 ; kawaguichi 2003 ) , and illumination of the upper layers of the disc ( nayakshin 2000 ) and/or conductive heating could also lead to an increase in @xmath88 .",
    "close inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig : t - l]d shows that the data points corresponding to the weak very high state ( anomalous regime ) are slightly lower than the solid line denoting constant @xmath105 .",
    "although this is not very significant , it could perhaps indicate a constant radius disc with slightly higher colour temperature correction .",
    "conversely , the disc in the strong very high state requires a _ decrease _ in colour temperature correction by a factor of @xmath89% i.e. @xmath124 .",
    "this would imply that the observed colour temperature was the same as the effective disc temperature , which is only possible when true absorption opacity dominates over electron scattering .",
    "this _ can not _ be the case at the observed @xmath80.5  kev temperatures .",
    "changing @xmath88 can not explain the strong very high state spectra with the disc with a constant radius .",
    "the above discussion assumed that the disc spectrum can be described by a simple colour temperature correction .",
    "plainly this may not be the case , and the disc spectrum could be completly distorted , for example if the inner disc colour temperature correction were much higher than at outer radii .",
    "the spectrum would then look like a low temperature disc with some fraction of the emission at much higher temperature .",
    "this is exactly what these strong very high state spectra look like , so we examine the effect of comptonization as a function of radius on the disc spectrum below .",
    "so far , we assumed the corona fully covers the disc as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : geo1 ] .",
    "however several other geometries can be considered , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : geo3 ] . if the corona is out of our line of sight to the disc e.g. a small inner region , perhaps physically representing an inner jet or bulk comptonisation of the infalling material ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : geo3]a and b ) , then the compton scattering does not affect the observed disc flux , so the correction used above _ overestimates _ the intrinsic disc emission .",
    "the problem of such a geometry is that the comptonising region would see many fewer disc photons than an observer , in conflict with the data ( see tables 2 and 3 ) . even without this problem ,",
    "the best that such a geometry could do is reduce the estimated intrinsic disc luminosity to that observed ( i.e. where none of the disc photons in our line of sight are intercepted ) .",
    "this puts us straight back to fig .",
    "[ fig : t - l]b , where the asca+pca+hexte data show a much lower temperature disc than expected for its luminosity in the very high state .",
    "alternatively , the corona could be patchy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : geo3]c ) , or cover only the inner disc ( fig .",
    "[ fig : geo3]d ) . in both these geometries",
    "the corona is in the line of sight to the disc , so again this predicts that the compton scattered photons we see are removed from the observed disc emission .",
    "the intrinsic disc emission should still be estimated as in fig .",
    "[ fig : t - l]d . while the patchy corona could take photons uniformly from the whole disc , the inner corona ( fig .",
    "[ fig : geo3]d ) would preferentially take only the inner disc ( highest temperature ) photons , perhaps leading to an underestimate of the disc temperature .",
    "this is analogous to having a variable colour temperature correction with radius ( see above ) .",
    "we model this by switching the seed photons in thcomp to blackbody ( rather than the mcd ) , and allow the temperatures of the observed inner disc and seed photons to be different .",
    "this gives a very strong upper limit on the seed photon temperature for the asca - pca - hexte data of @xmath125  kev , showing that the low disc temperature is _ not _ an artifact of the seed photon distribution assumed .",
    "however , the existence of the corona _ changes _ the disc temperature structure . in the limit of a corona that covers the whole disc",
    "then this has little effect as both the disc luminosity and temperature are reduced ( svensson & zdziarski 1994 ) , but for an inner disc corona the behaviour is more complex . only the inner disc temperature and luminosity are reduced , but these form the seed photons for the compton scattering . for a fraction @xmath126 of the total accretion power dissipated in the corona , the inner disc temperature is reduced by a factor @xmath127 ( svensson & zdziarski 1994 ) .",
    "this is an underestimate of the inner disc temperature as it intercepts and reprocesses a large fraction ( up to a half ) of the coronal flux .",
    "we will do more detailed modelling of this in a subsequent paper , but estimate that the size of this effect is not enough to make the temperature and luminosity consistent with the standard high / soft state radius disc .",
    "the discussion above shows that there are no easy alternatives to the conclusion that the inner disc is truncated in the strongly comptonised very high state spectra .",
    "if so , then there must be some overlap between the inner hot region and the truncated disc in order for it to intercept enough seed photons , but the larger radius disc can trivially produce the lower observed disc temperature at high luminosity .",
    "this geometry is rather similar to the truncated disc / hot inner flow inferred for the low / hard state , so would give a physical basis for the well known similarities between the very high state spectra and the intermediate state spectra ( seen towards the very end of the low / hard state ; belloni 1996 ; mendez 1997 ) .",
    "it could also explain the lower frequency qpo seen in the very high state ( e.g. the review by van der klis 2000 ; di matteo & psaltis 1999 ) .    a schematic picture for the whole disc evolution during the 1998 outburst of xte  j@xmath1 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geo2 ] .",
    "the outburst starts in the low / hard state , with a truncated disc , and hot inner flow ( panel a ) .",
    "the increase in mass accretion rate increases the optical depth of the inner flow before the inner disc has time to form , leading to an optically thick , cooler inner flow and truncated disc ( the strongly comptonised very high state , panel b ) on @xmath8day 5 ( wd01 ) . during days  530 ,",
    "the fraction of energy dissipated in the corona to that from the disc is kept almost constant ( fig .  [",
    "fig : evolution2]f ) , while @xmath21 and @xmath25 of the corona changed with time ( fig .",
    "[ fig : evolution2]d and e ) . through this period ,",
    "the x - ray flux reached at the peak ( day  13 ) .",
    "the radio flare was observed at this time with a continuance of 5  days , and vlba image showed evolving structure ( hannikainen  2001 ) .    during days",
    "3040 the inner disc is able to form at progressively smaller radii , perhaps due to the correlated decrease in fractional power dissipated in the corona ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : evolution2]f ) which reduces the coronal heating / irradiation .",
    "the disc finally reaches the last stable orbit at around day  40 , causing a noticeable change in disc temperature behaviour despite little change in luminosity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : evolution2]b ) .",
    "the power dissipated in the corona continues to drop , leading to more weakly comptonised spectra above the untruncated disc ( the weak very high state , anomalous regime ; days 40 - 52 ) .",
    "this eventually becomes a small ( @xmath128  20% ) fraction of the total power , giving the standard high / soft state ( after day 52 , panel e ) .",
    "this is similar to the geometry for the spectral states proposed by esin ( 1997 ) , except that the strongly comptonised very high state spectra corresponds here to a truncated disc .",
    "while this gives a good overall description of the properties of xte  j@xmath1 during its outburst , the remaining problem is what makes the truncated disc with the strong compton corona .",
    "advection dominated accretion flows can not be maintained at such high luminosities ( e.g. esin 1997 ) , although these are only an approximation to the complex nature of the optically thin , hot flow which is predicted from numerical simulations ( hawley & balbus 2002 ) .",
    "physically , such truncation could arise from disc overheating ( beloborodov 1998 ) , or by strong conduction / irradiative heating from the corona , or , perhaps most attractively , by disruption of the inner disc by jet formation .",
    "however , the total mass accretion rate can not be the trigger for this behaviour since ( apart from the peak ) the very high state spectra have total luminosity which is similar to that in the disc dominated regime seen in days 100180 .",
    "therefore some other parameters are required to drive the structural changes in the disc ( see e.g. van der klis 2001 ; homan  2001 ; mr03 )      the type of qpo seen is roughly consistent with the changes in geometry shown in fig .",
    "10 , and with the spectral state ( table  1 ) as suggested by homan  ( 2001 ) based on the spectral hardness ratio . since the qpo frequencies are thought to reflect the size of the comptonising region and the disc inner radii , it is meaningful to compare evolution of the qpo frequencies with that of disc inner radii estimated by the spectral analyses . as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : asm ] , through day  1830 , the frequency of the low - frequency qpo increased from @xmath129  hz , and after the day  30 , it was almost kept constant at @xmath130  hz .",
    "this is very consistent with the decrease in @xmath105 derived from the spectra through days 540 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : evolution2]c .",
    "indeed , homan  2001 suggested almost the same scenario of evolution of the accretion disc based on the qpo behavior .",
    "however , there is some inconsistency between the timing and the spectral behavior before day  18 .",
    "on one hand , the low - frequency qpo increased to @xmath131  hz around the peak ( day  13 ) .",
    "this frequency is _ higher _ than the @xmath130  hz which was observed after days  3040 , suggesting that the disc extends closer to the black hole during the peak . yet",
    "the x - ray spectra imply that the disc extends down to the last stable orbit during days 3040 and truncates at _ larger _ radii during the peak(fig .",
    "[ fig : evolution2]c ) .",
    "moreover , the high - frequency qpo which is sometimes seen in the very high state data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : asm ] ) shows rather different behaviour . in fig .",
    "[ fig : t - l ] , we marked the data points which have high - frequency qpos with big open diamonds .",
    "some green open squares showed both the characteristics of large inner radius by the spectral fits and the high frequency of the qpos .",
    "therefore , the qpo and the spectral behavior are not easily consistent , pointing either to a lack of understanding of how qpos and/or disc spectra relate to the inner radius .    as a brief comment",
    ", the strong very high state data with high frequency qpo and the low - frequency qpos of the higher frequencies may be considered to be relate to the jet ejection . as described in   4.2 , the radio flux was observed to increase suddenly at day 13 , the peak of x - ray flux ( wu  2002 ) , and the extending radio jet was reported on day 15 by hannikainen  ( 2001 ) . in fig.[fig : t - l ] , the data points which show strong radio emission were also marked with big circle plus cross .",
    "thus , the data with high - frequency qpo can be understood to have some relation to the jet ejection .",
    "the disc dominated high / soft state of galactic black holes can be well modelled by a disc of constant inner radius and colour temperature correction .",
    "this most probably indicates that the disc extends down to the innermost stable orbit around the black hole .",
    "this is clearly seen in the 1998 outburst of xte  j@xmath1 .",
    "however , the strongly comptonised very high state spectra seen at the start of the outburst do not follow this trend .",
    "careful modelling of these spectra show that the disc temperature is somewhat lower than expected for the observed disc luminosity for a constant radius disc . correcting the disc luminosity for the effects of compton scattering in a disc - corona geometry make this discrepancy much more marked .",
    "we discuss the effects of changing colour temperature corrections , and different geometries , but none of these can convincingly reproduce the observed disc temperatures and luminosities .",
    "we will model the effects of a more complex coronal geometry ( e.g. one with strong radial gradients in optical depth : fig .",
    "[ fig : geo3]d ) in a subsequent paper , but the simplest solution is that the inner disc is truncated in the strong very high state .",
