    "sunspot light - bridges are bright lanes of material that divide the umbra .",
    "their appearance signifies the reestablishment of the granulation within the spot , and often indicates the beginning of fragmentation of the spot itself @xcite .",
    "observations from the swedish solar telescope @xcite by @xcite showed for the first time that dark central lanes are common features of strong light - bridges . the magnetic field within light - bridges has been observed to be both weaker and more inclined than in the surrounding umbra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and their increased brightness relative to the surrounding umbra is a clear indication that the plasma temperature in this region is higher .",
    "it has also been noted that light - bridges often show enhanced chromospheric activity , with h@xmath0 surges and chomospheric jets reported in a number of cases @xcite .",
    "@xcite also found a constant brightness enhancement above a light - bridge in trace 1600   observations , while @xcite found that light - bridge formation was spatially and temporally coincident with the heating of @xmath1 1 mk loops as observed by trace .",
    "light - bridges thus seem important for releasing magnetic energy stored in the spot as well as in its decay . in this work",
    "we investigate the extent to which the presence of a sunspot light - bridge affects the overlying transition region and corona .",
    "ar 10953 was observed by hinode during the period 28 april 2007 to 3 may 2007 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and by stereo euvi @xcite .",
    "sot observed with the broad - band filter imager ( bfi ) and in the g - band , h@xmath0 and ca ii h passbands .",
    "the spectropolarimter ( sp ) performed fast maps of the region obtaining the full - polarization states of the fe lines at 630.15 and 630.25 nm at 0.32@xmath2 resolution .",
    "eis @xcite observed between 28 apr 07 to 2 may 07 , first with the 266@xmath2 slot in the fe xv 284   line with 20s cadence .",
    "the fe xv line is free from blends over the slot dispersion , and thus represents monochromatic emission at approximately 1.6 mk . during the remainder of the observing period ,",
    "eis produced rasters with both the 1@xmath2 and 2@xmath2 slits .",
    "here we focus on the he ii 256.32  si vii",
    "275.35  fe xii 195.12   and fe xv 284.16   lines that provide broad temperature coverage from the chromosphere to the corona .",
    "standard calibration procedures were applied to the eis data and cross - correlation techniques used to remove the orbital variation and spacecraft jitter that affects the 266 @xmath2 slot images .",
    "line - of - sight velocity maps were derived from the eis raster data using a single gaussian fit ( _ mpfit _ ) .",
    "he ii 256.32 is substantially blended with fe xiii 256.42 , fe xii 256.41 and si x 256.37 , but for disk observations of an active region such as this the he ii contribution should contribute 80% or more to the blend @xcite .",
    "data from the sp were corrected for dark current , flat - field and cosmic rays with standard solarsoft routines and then inverted using the full atmosphere inversion code lilia ( socas navarro , 2001 ) .",
    "the intrinsic 180-degree azimuth ambiguity was resolved using the non - potential magnetic field calculation ( npfc ) method by @xcite .",
    "standard calibration procedures were applied to the euvi data and co - alignment between sot , eis and euvi was achieved through first co - aligning sot h@xmath0 images with eis he ii 256   and euvi he ii 304   .",
    "we concentrate on periods of good eis data coverage to study the coronal counterpart ( if any ) of the light - bridge , and thus focus here on the 30 april 2007 during which eis was performing raster scans of the region .",
    "sot sp performed several scans during this period .",
    "figure 1 shows an sot continuum image of the sunspot and light - bridge ( left ) and a close up of the light - bridge showing photospheric doppler velocities within the structure .",
    "figure 2 shows the coronal emission within the active region and its relationship to the chromospheric ca ii emission .",
    "light - curves of the intensity within the light - bridge and its immediate vicinity form ca ii and euvi 171 data show no clear relationship between variations in the corona and the chromosphere .",
    "supersonic downflows have been reported in the light - bridge on 1 may 2007 by @xcite , and we note that enhanced ( not supersonic ) velocities are also seen on 30 apr 2007 ( fig.1 ) . @xcite suggest the supersonic downflows provide evidence of chromospheric reconnection , since a good ( not perfect ) correlation is seen with ca ii jets from the light - bridge . in the eis data we see that the light- bridge is located in regions that show significant outflows ; the largest ( @xmath340 km / s ) being seen in he ii .",
    "figure 3 shows a series of eis intensity images from 30 april 2007 on the top row , with temperature of formation increasing from left to right ( he ii , fe viii , fe xii and fe xv ) . beneath each intensity image",
    "is the corresponding relative velocity map derived from a single component fit .",
    "we caution that the he ii line is a complex blend including contributions from si x and fe x on the red - side and that we have not fitted the blends .",
    "however , the dominant blends are to the red , and thus more likely to produce enhanced downflows rather than upflows .",
    "we find evidence for increased intensity above the light - bridge in stereo euvi 171  data , in eis he ii ( 256   ) and fe xii ( 195   ) rasters , and also in the eis 266@xmath2 fe xv 284   slot images , but not in si vii 275   raster images .",
    "there are some puzzling inconsistencies , but nevertheless indications that enhanced heating above light - bridges extends higher than previously thought into the corona .",
    "enhanced upflows are seen with eis in the regions above the light-bridge.these upflows are strongest in the he ii 256   line , and are also located in the vicinity of the outflows that have been identified as potential contributors to the slow solar wind ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "a more detailed presentation of this work will appear in a forthcoming paper .",
