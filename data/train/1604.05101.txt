    "codes @xcite have attracted notable interest for their ability to provably achieve the symmetric capacity of discrete memoryless channels with low complexity decoding as the code length tends to infinity . the originally proposed successive cancellation ( sc )",
    "decoding could attain this performance with computational complexity @xmath0 , with @xmath1 being the code length .",
    "computational complexity and latency are two major bottlenecks when dealing with long codes .",
    "hence , shorter codes are practically of interest , especially for low complexity and resource constrained applications e.g. massive machine - to - machine communication or wireless sensor networks , or latency sensitive applications e.g. mission critical machine - type of communication for steering and control . moreover , in most of such applications only short packets are used .",
    "however , sc decoder performs poorly for short codes since the polarization effect can not be fully utilized when the code length is not long enough .",
    "this has lead to invention of several encoding and decoding algorithms for polar codes that require a slightly higher complexity and rate compromise in exchange for improved performance .",
    "it is shown that concatenated with other codes such as reed - solomon ( rs ) @xcite and @xcite , ldpc @xcite , bch and convolutional @xcite codes , short polar codes can perform much better .",
    "additionally , it was noticed that systematic polar codes have a significant advantage in terms of bit error rate compared to the original non - systematic codes @xcite .",
    "list decoding @xcite was proposed to improve the performance of the sc decoder with complexity @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the list size .",
    "the idea is to keep a list of the recent @xmath3 most likely decoding paths while moving on the decoding graph instead of moving only on a single path .",
    "only the codeword with the highest probability is selected at the end .",
    "although it can approach the maximum likelihood performance , it was still behind the state - of - the - art ldpc and turbo codes @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , cyclic redundancy check ( crc)-assisted systematic polar coding with sc - list decoding performs similarly , or can even outperform these codes , provided that a sufficiently large list size is used for decoding@xcite . in this approach originally presented in @xcite ,",
    "a crc checksum is used to find the actual codeword in the list instead of selecting the most likely one .    a typical physical layer ( phy ) frame consists of multiple codewords . for successful delivery of the packet ,",
    "all should be decoded correctly . hence",
    ", the computational complexity of list decoding of @xmath4 codewords with list decoding would be @xmath5 at best , i.e. when the efficient and numerically stable implementation in @xcite is used .",
    "we consider the idea originally presented in @xcite and later in @xcite for rs - polar concatenated codes to relax the requirement of a list for each codeword and instead deploy multiple sc decoders in parallel when a frame of multiple polar codewords is decoded .",
    "there are several advantages in doing so .",
    "most importantly , the total required number of operations can be reduced down to @xmath6 .",
    "in addition to the parallelized design , one can benefit from more capable forward error correction ( fec ) codes instead of the crc error detection codes to achieve this objective . in @xcite",
    "the code parameters are derived to achieve a target frame error rate .",
    "however , the tradeoffs between the code lengths as well as the rates of the concatenated codes for a given frame length have not been addressed .",
    "frame length is often designed according to several different factors such as maximum latency , sampling rate , hardware limitations , multiple access and collision probabilities , etc . in realistic applications and",
    "is not arbitrarily selected to achieve a target frame error rate .",
    "obviously , the polarization effect can be utilized more effectively in longer polar codes .",
    "it is not yet clear whether e.g. a low - rate , long polar code combined with a high rate short fec code can perform better or the opposite combination , i.e. , when a strong fec code is used with less polarized codewords .",
    "we will address these tradeoffs in this paper by taking into consideration the effective throughput of the transmission protocol in use .",
    "since the concatenation of the polar codes only rises for short codes ( long polar codes can already achieve the channel capacity ) , we focus only on short code lengths ( i.e. not more than several hundred bits ) .",
    "this section provides the preliminaries of polar codes and the background on code concatenation .",
    "polar codes are the first linear block codes that can provably achieve the symmetric capacity of discrete memoryless channels .",
    "consistent with the original definition of the polar codes @xcite , for a polar code of length @xmath1 assume the generator matrix @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a permutation matrix known as the bit - reversal , @xmath9 is the polarization kernel , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the @xmath12th kronecker power of @xmath13 . assume the column vector @xmath14^\\top$ ] of length @xmath1 , where `` @xmath15 '' is the vector transpose symbol . to construct a polar code of rate @xmath16 , first a subset of size @xmath17 of indices in @xmath18 denoted by @xmath19 and referred to as``frozen '' bits",
    "are set to predefined values known for the decoder .",
    "these values are denoted by @xmath20 .",
    "the remaining @xmath21 elements referred to as the `` information '' bits belong to the set @xmath22 which is called the information set . in this way",
    ", @xmath21 message bits can be substituted in the bit positions identified in @xmath22 .",
    "the corresponding codeword @xmath23^\\top$ ] can be given by @xmath24 an interesting feature of the polar codes is that different elements of the information set have different levels of reliability .",
    "more explicitly , every element in the information set @xmath25 can be seen as a channel with a unique capacity .",
    "hence , each one is often called a separate _",
    "bit channel_. due to the polarization effect , some bit channels are more _ degraded _ ,",
    "i.e. the capacity of those channels is less and some bit channels become upgraded , i.e. their capacity improves .",
    "the frozen bits are usually selected from the most degraded bit channels while the information bits are mapped to most upgraded channels .",
    "for simplicity , we define a polar code @xmath26 of rate @xmath27 with a six - tuple @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the code and message lengths , @xmath31 is the vector of bit channel indices sorted from the most to the least degraded , and @xmath32 is the vector of error probabilities corresponding to each bit channel . to illustrate this , the error probabilities of different bit channels of a length-8 polar code",
    "are calculated by simulation and are plotted in fig.[fig_ber8 ] for various code rates and signal - to - noise - ratio ( snr ) equal to 5 db .",
    "the dashed line represents the bit error probability corresponding to hard - decision decoding of a binary phase shift keying ( bpsk ) system .",
    "note that all bit channels are not available at every rate .",
    "hence , the number of bars are different across the bit channels ( for instance , the first bit channel is only available at rate @xmath33 ) .",
    "consider the polar code of rate @xmath33 ( i.e. the one with no frozen bits ) .",
    "it can be seen that the most and least degraded bit channels are the bit channels `` 1 '' and `` 8 '' respectively . however",
    ", none of the bit channels can be considered upgraded in comparison with a single use of the channel with uncoded transmission ( i.e. the bpsk system ) .",
    "this is due to the propagation of error in the decoder to the next bits after a false decoding of the preceding bits . when the code rate increases , the degraded bits are omitted from the decoding procedure since they are categorized as the frozen bits",
    ". therefore , the probability of error will reduce . also note that the order of the bit channels according to their degradation is @xmath34 .",
    "it can be observed that only the reliability of the bit channels of code rates below and equal to 1/2 is better than that of uncoded transmission .",
    "decoding of the polar codes is successively performed on a decoding graph such that when an information bit is decoded , it can disentangle the dependencies in a way that the next bits can be decoded with the knowledge of the decoded bit .",
    "hence , it is called successive cancellation decoder .",
    "a high - level presentation of sc decoding of a desired bit in a polar codeword is given in algorithm [ alg_sc_decode ] .",
    "assume a codeword @xmath35 of length @xmath1 is transmitted using binary antipodal signaling through an additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel with noise variance @xmath36 . at the receiver side , denote the received signal by @xmath37 .",
    "the relationship between @xmath38 and @xmath39 can be seen through a synthesized vector channel with transition probabilities denoted by @xmath40 .",

    "]    although the decoding complexity is only @xmath0@xcite , the performance of sc decoder for short and moderate codes is not promising .",
    "therefore , many improved decoding schemes are proposed .",
    "most notable is the sc - list decoder @xcite with complexity @xmath45 that can approach performance of the maximum likelihood decoder .",
    "a sc - list decoder is essentially a sc - decoder that keeps track of the best @xmath3 decoding paths on the decoding graph and keeps the list updated with the best new @xmath3 paths after each hard decision is made . at the end , only the most likely path is selected .",
    "exact calculation of the error probabilities of various polar bit channels is computationally prohibitive due to the exponential complexity of density evolution .",
    "instead , there are efficient schemes that can estimate these probabilities with less complexity .",
    "most notable is the gaussian approximation ( ga ) which is based on the fact that the log - likelihood ratio of the received bits are normally distributed .",
    "this approach is proposed in @xcite and @xcite , and is used in this paper to calculate the error probabilities of various bit channels .",
    "namely , the average value of the log - likelihood ratio can first be approximated by the following recursion @xcite @xmath46}_n\\right)= \\begin{cases }   \\phi^{-1}\\left(1-{\\left(\\phi \\left ( \\operatorname{e}(l^{[(b+1)/2]}_{n/2 } ) \\right)\\right)}^2 \\right ) , & \\text{if } b \\text { is odd } \\\\   2\\operatorname{e}(l^{[b/2]}_{n/2 } ) , & \\text{if } b \\text { is even } ,    \\end{cases}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath47 denotes expectation and @xmath48 can be fitted with the exponential model @xcite @xmath49 and the termination rule is @xmath50}_{1})=2/{\\sigma^2}$ ] .",

    "the idea of concatenating two different codes was first introduced and analyzed by forney in his doctoral thesis @xcite .",
    "it was a method to yield the performance of long codes by breaking the decoding complexity into segments of shorter concatenated codes .",
    "he proved that in this way the probability of error vanishes exponentially while the decoding complexity grows algebraically with the length of the shorter segments .",
    "however , it is required that the code length of the inner code be logarithmic with the length of the outer code which can considerably reduce the effectiveness of polarization when the polar codes are used as the inner code .",
    "concatenation of polar codes has shown its potential to approach the channel capacity with low complexity and several schemes have been proposed .",
    "another important difference between the presented fec assisted decoding of polar codes and the conventional decoding of concatenated codes is that the decoding of the inner code is performed sequentially , where one of the outer codewords are decoded in each step . in the conventional approach",
    ", all inner codewords are decoded first to come up with the outer codewords .",
    "we consider a point - to - point packet - based communication system .",
    "the frame construction at the the medium access control ( mac ) and phy layer is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_enc ] .",
    "data of interest is first encoded by an error detection code at the mac layer and then the frame along with the checksums undergoes a concatenated encoding at the physical layer . essentially , a @xmath52 linear block code ( lbc ) @xmath53 is exploited for fec - assisted decoding of the inner polar code @xmath26 , where @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 are the code and message lengths ( in bits ) and the correction capability of the outer lbc , respectively . instead of using the whole frame for one concatenation , one can also devide the frame to a number of super - segments ( for instance @xmath57 ) and perform this procedure on each super - segment just like in fig .",
    "[ fig_enc ] .",
    "note that different bit channels of the polar code have different levels of reliability and hence require different levels of protections .",
    "although we can allocate different rates of the outer code for each bit channel , at the end we need to pad the remaining bits with zeros to fill the empty segments which will lead to the same number of redundant bits of the fixed allocation .",
    "therefore , we assume outer codes with equal rates for all polar bit channels to fully utilize the available frame .",
    "the frame construction procedure is presented in algorithm [ alg_construction ] .",
    "divide the frame @xmath58 to @xmath57 super - segments @xmath59 + merge all encoded super - segments @xmath60 to form the encoded frame @xmath61    due to several advantages of bch codes such as simple decoding and the precise control over their correction capability of multiple bits , we focus on binary bch codes for the outer lbc .",
    "it is shown that the decoding complexity of the binary bch codes can be reduced to @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "the crc code is traditionally used to verify the integrity of the frame after decoding at the receiver side .",
    "the frames with failed checksums are discarded and should be retransmitted .",
    "divide @xmath63 to @xmath57 super - segments @xmath64 + merge all decoded super - segments @xmath65 to form the frame @xmath58      the key fact to consider is that in any level of decoding if a faulty hard decision is made by the sc decoder , it can propagate to the next levels and with a high probability the decoded message include several bit errors .",
    "therefore , it is very important to first make sure the decisions made by the sc decoder are correct and then proceed to the next levels .",
    "this is the basis for the fec - assisted decoding where an outer block code can be used to protect different bit levels against false decisions . in the traditional decoding of the concatenated codes",
    "the inner code is first completely decoded and then the outer decoder uses the result to reconstruct the message .",
    "however , in the fec - assisted decoding procedure illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_dec ] , the decoding of the inner polar code is not a one - time procedure but a successive one . at first ,",
    "only the first information bit is decoded . however , the first information bit of _ all _ the codewords are decoded in _ parallel_. after this point , all the parallel sc decoders halt and pass the decoded column to the outer decoder for fec correction .",
    "the corresponding bits of the corrected outer codeword are then passed again back to each of the sc decoders and now they all can proceed to decode the second information bit .",
    "this procedure continues until all information bits are decoded .",
    "the computational complexity of this approach is the number of the outer codewords times the complexity of the sc decoder ( plus the complexity of the outer code ) .",
    "a sequential implementation of the fec - assisted decoding is given in algorithm [ alg_sec_dec ] .",
    "an important question in designing the concatenated codes is how to optimally design the code parameters of the outer and the inner code .",
    "we first assume single concatenation which means the frame is not divided into smaller segments before concatenation .",
    "identically , in this section we look for the best combinations of the codes , regardless of the frame length .",
    "we denote the total number of concatenations in the frame by an integer @xmath57 .",
    "[ fig_enc ] represents the case with single concatenation @xmath66 .",
    "when @xmath67 , the frame can be divided into @xmath57 super - segments where each segment can again be represented similarly to fig .",
    "[ fig_enc ] .",
    "we will discuss the case with @xmath67 in the next section and consider @xmath66 here .",
    "assume a polar code @xmath26 of length @xmath68 is given .",
    "consider the set @xmath69 of bch codes of length @xmath70 over integer @xmath71 values that can be concatenated , where @xmath72 is the highest possible length of the outer code .",
    "note that the total number of parallel sc decoders is given by the length of the outer code .",
    "hence , it is practically required to assume a maximum value for @xmath54 . in order to find the best combination , we focus on the effective throughput of the transmission protocol defined as @xmath73 where @xmath74 , @xmath27 , and @xmath75 is the frame success rate in a given snr denoted by @xmath76 .",
    "@xmath75 is calculated by averaging the number of correctly delivered frames to the total sent frames .",
    "an optimization problem can be formulated as follows @xmath77 the outer code can be found using algorithm [ alg_con_np ] .",
    "algorithm [ alg_findoptimal ] considers the error probabilities of different bit channels of the polar code to find the optimal codes @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",

    "the concatenation of polar and the outer code can be designed based on different objectives . in the first scenario",
    "we look for the optimal design that maximizes the effective throughput with a single concatenation ( @xmath66 ) .",

    "the resulting optimal effective throughput is almost the same but the optimal rates of the outer and the polar code are slightly different .",
    "it is noted that in a given polar code length the maximum achievable throughput depends on the length of the outer code .",
    "the higher code lengths lead to higher values .",
    "however , a form of saturation can be observed in the sense that the performance improvement is not considerable when the outer code lengths greater than @xmath130 are used .",

    "we first observe the performance of the concatenated codes with respect to various @xmath57 and @xmath95 values in fig .",
    "[ fig_phy_a ] .",

    "it is seen that the achievable effective throughput will reduce if we divide either of the outer code or the polar code into @xmath67 smaller segments and repeatedly perform the concatenation for each segment .",
    "the achievable throughput versus the rate of the polar code is also depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_phy_c ] and the optimal values are tabulated in table [ tab_phy ] .",
    "generally speaking , the optimal throughput can not exceed more than @xmath131 , regardless of the frame length .",
    "the specific value will depend on the snr though .",
    "of course this limit is reached through different code combinations and @xmath57 values in various frame lengths .",
    "the only difference that the frame length can make is the total number of feasible codes which can be seen from the density of the points in the figure .",
    "the vertical lines in the figure correspond to short polar codes since the rate of the code has a coarse granularity .",
    "for instance , with @xmath132 only four different rates are possible ( excluding zero ) .",
    "the possible combinations of the outer code contribute to different values of the effective throughput ( i.e. vertical shifts ) for each rate .",
    "a special case in this figure is when @xmath133 , i.e. the polar code does not perform any error correction and only the correction capability of the outer code is utilized . in such cases , usually with a very small @xmath29 ( e.g. 4 ) and a large @xmath57 an effective throughput up to about @xmath134 is possible .",
    "it is improved by more than two orders of magnitude when the rate of the polar code is reduced and the polarization takes effect",
    ". however , only one frozen bit would be enough ( at this specific snr ) since in all cases the @xmath135 polar code can achieve the highest throughput when concatenated with the appropriate outer code .",
    "a similar simulation is performed at @xmath136 db and the results are given in table [ tab_phy ] .",
    "it can be seen that while still @xmath66 has the best result , more polarized bits ( i.e. lower code rate with longer code lengths ) are preferred at such low snrs .",
    "the impact of the outer code length on the effective throughput is illustrated in fi .",
    "[ fig_phy_c ] . a direct relationship between the length of the outer code and the maximum achievable throughput can be inferred .",
    "however , a form of saturation in the effective throughout can also be identified for @xmath137 at this snr .",
    "this is actually due to the fact that the number of codewords in the frame is equal to the length of the outer code which is more elaborated in the sequel .    similar simulations were accomplished for the constrained mac frame length scenario which is represented in table [ tab_mac ] .",
    "the final optimal design corresponding to the target fsr scenario is very close to the constrained mac frame length for practical target fsr values .",
    "however , it is not always the case .",
    "for instance , with @xmath138 a @xmath139 outer code with a @xmath140 polar code can achieve @xmath141 with a target fsr @xmath142 at @xmath91 db using a shorter phy frame length .",
    "although the optimal values of @xmath57 are higher than one , other codes with @xmath66 can also reach very close to the same throughput . therefore , it is concluded that under all scenarios no performance benefit ( in terms of the effective throughput ) can be made by dividing the frame to @xmath67 super - segments and applying multiple concatenations .    in the sequel we study the impact of increasing the length of the frame on the achievable throughput . in the classic systems ,",
    "each frame is composed of several codewords .",
    "longer frames are composed of more codewords .",
    "it is more likely to have one or more false decoded codewords in longer frames , hence frame error probability is higher .",
    "the reason is that all codewords should be decoded correctly to deliver the frame successfully . in fig [ fig_t_l_phy ] ,",
    "the performance of polar coding with sc decoder rate - optimized for each frame length is compared with that of fec - assisted scheme , assuming @xmath143 and for various phy frame lengths and snrs .",
    "it is shown that the achievable throughput corresponding to the sc decoding drops with increasing the phy frame length .",

    "<S> it is shown that the divide - concatenate strategy for long frames does not lead to any considerable gain . </S>",
