    "the hamiltonian has the usual `` supersymmetric '' properties of the rk point : its ground state is exactly known and given by the equal - amplitude superposition of all possible states,@xcite and the quantum mechanics can be mapped onto a classical stochastic dynamics in imaginary time.@xcite we further consider the hole term @xmath4 as a perturbation in @xmath5 , @xmath6 . to simplify the formulae",
    ", we assume @xmath7 , but our results are trivially extendable to @xmath8 .    in the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath9 , the position of the hole @xmath10 is a static parameter .",
    "we consider the hole on the infinite lattice ( or , equivalently , on a large finite lattice far from the boundary ) .",
    "in such a setup there are two degenerate ground states of @xmath9 for each hole position .",
    "they correspond to two disconnected ( topological ) sectors @xmath11 of the hilbert space , characterized by the values @xmath12 of the vison operator @xmath13 for some contour @xmath14 connecting the hole position @xmath10 to infinity ( in a finite system to the boundary ) .",
    "@xcite the corresponding ground states are given by the sums over all dimer coverings in the respective topological sector and are denoted as @xmath15 .",
    "note that while the labeling @xmath16 of the two sectors @xmath11 depends on the choice of the contour @xmath14 , the sectors themselves do not . changing the contour @xmath14 amounts to possible interchanges @xmath17 and , therefore , @xmath18 .",
    "this ambiguity reflects the z@xmath0 degree of freedom in labeling the topological sectors , and it will play an important role in the motion of the hole with a trapped vison . technically , this z@xmath0 gauge may be fixed by specifying ( arbitrarily ) , for each @xmath10 , a reference dimer covering which belongs to @xmath19 .",
    "the two topological sectors @xmath11 differ by the parity of the dimer intersection at infinity and hence are indistinguishable by any local operator ( since all correlation functions are short - ranged in the rk model on the triangular lattice  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , for excitations obtained from the ground states by local operators ( in the vicinity of @xmath10 ) , one can establish a one - to - one linear mapping between the states in @xmath20 and in @xmath21 .",
    "taking odd and even combinations of the corresponding states @xmath22 , we obtain the decomposition of the hilbert space into even and odd sectors @xmath23 .",
    "those even and odd sectors correspond to the non - vison and vison sectors of excitations , respectively , introduced in ref .  .",
    "the key observation for our discussion is that the hamiltonian [ eq .  ] preserves the decomposition into @xmath23 at every point @xmath10 .",

    "hence , the excitations of the moving hole can also be classified into two branches : the non - vison branch [ contained in @xmath27 and the vison branch [ contained in @xmath28 .",
    "this splitting into even ( non - vison ) and odd ( vison ) branches is a generic feature of any perturbative mixing of topological sectors in quantum dimer models .",

    ", the problem of the moving hole maps onto the tight - binding model with the hopping amplitude @xmath30 for nearest - neighbor @xmath10 and @xmath26 ( here and in the following we always assume normalized states ) . this amplitude may be converted into an expectation value in the rk model with a static hole , @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the numbers of dimer coverings with one site and one three - site triangle removed , respectively .",
    "the ratio @xmath34 is well defined in the limit of the infinite system and can be computed numerically with a suitable method .",
    "we have calculated this coefficient with a monte carlo simulation similar to that in refs .",
    "and ( using clusters of toroidal geometry with up to 17@xmath3517 sites ) , with the result @xmath36 .",
    "taking into account the potential term in @xmath4 and performing the fourier transformation in @xmath10 , the dispersion of the hole without a vison takes the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 are the projections of the vector @xmath41 on the three lattice directions ( with @xmath42 ) .     and",

    "the hopping of a hole with a trapped vison is more complicated .",
    "the phases of the odd - sector ground states , @xmath44 , can not be synchronized invariantly for all @xmath10 , which reflects the frustration of the vison motion .",
    "@xcite the freedom of the z@xmath0 gauge [ the contours @xmath14 in eq .   or , equivalently , the reference dimer configuration for each @xmath10 ] corresponds to the choice of the overall sign for the states in @xmath46 .",
    "regardless of the chosen z@xmath0 gauge , the hopping amplitude vanishes to first order , @xmath47 for nearest - neighbors @xmath10 and @xmath26 .",
    "this can be seen as the cancellation of the two types of hopping processes from @xmath10 to @xmath26 , corresponding to two possible dimer flips ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "each of those dimer flips maps each of @xmath48 into one of @xmath43 .",
    "the change in topological sector depends on the chosen gauge , but the correspondence between the two sectors @xmath48 and the two sectors @xmath43 is opposite for the two types of flips .",

    "the nonvanishing second - order terms are ( c ) on - site and ( d ) next - next - nearest - neighbor hoppings . ]    similarly to the cancellation of the nearest - neighbor hopping amplitude to first order in perturbation , one can show the cancellation to second order of the hopping processes @xmath54 connecting nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor sites [ processes ( a ) and ( b ) in fig .  [ fig2 ] ] .",
    "one can verify that , in those cases , processes symmetric with respect to the line @xmath55 exactly cancel each other .",
    "the only nontrivial hopping in the second order occurs for trajectories @xmath56 involving two links along the same direction [ i.e. , for the on - site energy correction and for the next - next - nearest - neighbor hopping , processes ( c ) and ( d ) in fig .  [ fig2 ] ] .",
    "the corresponding next - next - nearest - neighbor hopping amplitude [ fig .",
    "[ fig2](d ) ] to second order in perturbation [ eq .  ] may be expressed via dynamic correlation functions in the rk model with a static hole at position @xmath26 , @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 the dynamic correlation function @xmath60 is well defined in the limit of infinite system size and does not depend on the topological sector in this limit .",
    "it may be computed with a classical monte carlo method as in ref .  .",

    "one can show that this local gauge convention for any two sites separated by two lattice periods can be consistently extended to a global gauge on the sublattice of such sites ( with the period of this sublattice equals twice that of the original lattice ) .",
    "there are four such sublattices ( fig .  [ fig3 ] ) , and the hole - vison excitation hops on each of them independently , without a possibility to cross over to another sublattice .",
    "the resulting dispersion relation is that of the tight - binding model with the doubled lattice constant and the hopping amplitude given by eq .",
    ", @xmath66 the on - site energy @xmath67 is equal to that in the non - vison sector in eq .  .",

    "the hole - vison excitations with dispersion are quadruply degenerate ( by sublattice ) for each value of @xmath41 in the brillouin zone of the doubled lattice .",
    "while we have explicitly demonstrated this degeneracy to second order , it can be extended to all orders of perturbation theory .",
    "in fact , this degeneracy is determined by the symmetries of the original hamiltonian [ eq .  ] in the vison sector and can thus be promoted from a perturbative argument to the exact spectrum .",
    "the exact degeneracy can be proven using the translational invariance of the hamiltonian , together with the symmetry under point inversion ( rotation by @xmath70 ) and time reversal .",
    "physically , this degeneracy can be understood as the cancellation of virtual processes for the flux - carrying excitation on the frustrated triangular lattice .    finally , let us note that , while our derivation of the vison - hole spectrum was formally done at the rk - point , its form and degeneracy are the same in the whole liquid phase away from the rk point ( estimated to extend to the region @xmath71 in ref .  ) , provided the hole hopping is small .",
    "only the numerical coefficients in the hopping amplitudes @xmath72 and @xmath64 get modified in this case . furthermore",
    ", our results equally apply when more than one hole is present in the system as long as the holes are sufficiently far apart and do not interact with each other .",
    "in this paper , we have calculated the dispersion of a single mobile hole in the rvb liquid phase of the doped rk quantum dimer model on the triangular lattice .",
    "we find two branches of excitations : one for the bare hole and the other for a hole - vison bound state . the effective motion of the hole - vison state is strongly modified by the z@xmath0 flux associated with the vison .",
    "interference effects due to lattice frustration reduce the bandwidth of this type of excitation and lead to additional degeneracies .",
    "these are general properties , which should be observed in any doped z@xmath0 rvb liquid on frustrated lattices .    in our specific model",
    "[ eq .  ] , the energy of a _ static _",
    "( @xmath73 ) vison - hole bound state equals that of a hole without a vison . in other words ,",
    "the vison does not cost any energy if placed in a hole ( while in the bulk , its energy is a finite fraction of @xmath74 , see ref .  ) . in the limit of a small hopping amplitude @xmath68 ,",
    "the energy of a static excitation is split , with the bandwidth proportional to @xmath68 for the bare hole and to @xmath75 for the hole - vison bound state . as a result ,",
