    "the h and he resonance lines have a strong diagnostic potential .",

    "the prominence is represented by a 1d vertical plane - parallel slab .",
    "we consider 2 types of prominence atmospheres : constant temperature and pressure within the prominence , or with a prominence - to - corona transition region ( pctr ) . in the latter case",
    "the temperature and pressure profiles are of the same type as proposed by anzer & heinzel ( 1999 ) .",
    "the top plots on fig .",
    "[ fit6 ] show each line profile observed by sumer and the theoretical profile which best fits the observed profile . we obtain a different model for each line ( see tab .",
    "[ results ] ) .",
    "each one of the three selected models is isothermal and isobaric .",
    "the pctr models considered here can not reproduce the observed profiles for this prominence .",
    "we also searched for a unique model that simultaneously reproduces the three line profiles .",
    "the result is shown on the three bottom panels of fig .",
    "the selected model is the same as the one which best fits the observed he  i 584 line alone ( our model # 3 ) , but it fails to reproduce the ly@xmath0 line .",
    "there is a long - standing problem regarding the ly-@xmath0 line ( see , e.g. , patsourakos & vial 2002 ) .",
    "some possible explanations are : * 1 ) * we may need a different type of temperature profile for this particular prominence . *",
    "2 ) * the fine structure of the prominence should be incorporated in the modelling . *",
    "3 ) * the incident radiation illuminating the structure is strongly affected by the presence of several active regions on the disk seen on mdi images of the same day .",
