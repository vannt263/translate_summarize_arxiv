    "precise predictions for hard strong - interaction processes require transcending the standard next - to - leading order ( nlo ) approximation of perturbative qcd . resummations of large logarithms may be sufficient for specific processes , but generally full next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) calculations are called for . for electron ",
    "proton scattering and proton(anti-)proton colliders this demands both partonic cross sections and parton distribution of nnlo accuracy .",
    "the former quantities are presently available only for the structure functions in deep - inelastic scattering ( dis )  @xcite  which provide the backbone of our knowledge of the proton s parton densities and are among the quantities best suited for measuring  @xmath4  and the total cross section for the drell - yan process  @xcite  which in the form of @xmath6 and @xmath7 production is an excellent candidate for an accurate luminosity monitor at tevatron and the lhc  @xcite .",

    "we discuss the resulting improvement  @xcite of our approximations of the splitting functions in @xmath1-space  @xcite , and compare , in the extended range @xmath0 of safe applicability , the resulting approximate nnlo flavour - singlet evolution and its scale stability to the nlo results .",
    "we also briefly re - address @xcite the question to what extent the leading small-@xmath1 contributions to the splitting functions and coefficient functions dominate the small-@xmath1 evolution .",
    "taking into account the fast convergence of the splitting - function series shown in section 2 , the next - to - next - to - next - to - leading order ( n@xmath2lo ) corrections for the dis structure functions can be effectively derived at @xmath8 using available partial results  @xcite for the three - loop coefficient functions .",
    "the effect of the nnlo and n@xmath2lo terms is discussed in section  3 for the scaling violations of the non - singlet structure function @xmath9 and the resulting determination of @xmath4  @xcite .",

    "knowing the leading @xmath28 term  @xcite is clearly instrumental in constraining the small-@xmath1 behaviour of @xmath12  something not efficiently done by a small number of @xmath29 integer moments ( [ eq1b ] ) . however , even at @xmath30 where the non-@xmath18 parts contribute less than 10% to both approximations ` a ' and ` b ' , this term does not sufficiently dominate over the ( so far uncalculated ) subleading @xmath31 contribution in eq .",

    "note that the spikes close to @xmath37 do not represent large nnlo corrections , instead they derive from zeros of the denominators .",
    "in fact , the nnlo corrections are very small ( except for the quark evolution at small  @xmath1 ) , much smaller than their nlo counterparts not shown in the figure ( except for the gluon evolution at small @xmath1 , where already the nlo corrections are rather small ) .",
    "consequently , as illustrated in figs .",
    "2(b ) and 2(c ) , the renormalization - scale stability of the prediction is considerably improved over the full @xmath1-range .",
    "if measured over the conventional range @xmath38 , the @xmath39 dependence of @xmath40 amounts to less than @xmath41 at large @xmath1 and @xmath42 small @xmath1 , that of @xmath43 to less than @xmath5 and @xmath41 , respectively .",

    "2(a ) reaches about @xmath45 for @xmath40 and @xmath46 for @xmath43 at @xmath47 and @xmath48 corresponding to @xmath49 . in view of the also enhanced nlo scale dependence",

    "the large nnlo corrections at very large @xmath1 originate in the non - singlet part of the two - loop quark coefficient function .",
    "note , however , that the ( positive ) gluon contribution to @xmath52 at nnlo still amounts to 5% at @xmath53 ( 40% more than at nlo ) , and falls below 1% only above @xmath54  @xcite .",
    "this effect is large enough to jeopardize analyses applying a non - singlet formalism to the proton s @xmath9 in the region @xmath55 .",
    "the negative nnlo corrections to @xmath9 at small @xmath1 arise from the two - loop gluon coefficient function @xmath56 .",

    "we conclude this section by examining the dominance of the small-@xmath1 terms of the nnlo splitting functions and coefficient functions for the small-@xmath1 convolutions . in fig .",
    "4 the results for @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath56 obtained by keeping only the @xmath62  terms of @xmath63 are compared , down to @xmath64 , with the ( for @xmath10 approximate ) full results .",
