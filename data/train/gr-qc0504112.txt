    "the laser interferometric space antenna ( lisa ) is a space mission jointly proposed to the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) and the european space agency ( esa ) .",
    "its aim is to detect and study gravitational waves ( gw ) in the millihertz frequency band",
    ". it will use coherent laser beams exchanged between three identical spacecraft forming a giant ( almost ) equilateral triangle of side @xmath0 kilometers . by monitoring the relative phase changes of the light beams exchanged between the spacecraft , it will extract the information about the gravitational waves it will observe at unprecedented sensitivities @xcite .    the astrophysical sources that lisa is expected to observe within its operational frequency band ( @xmath1 hz ) include extra - galactic super - massive black - hole coalescing binaries , stochastic gravitational wave background from the early universe , and galactic and extra - galactic coalescing binary systems containing white dwarfs and neutron stars .",
    "recent surveys have uniquely identified twenty binary systems emitting gravitational radiation within the lisa band , while population studies have concluded that the large number of binaries present in our own galaxy should produce a stochastic background that will lie significantly above the lisa instrumental noise in the low - part of its frequency band .",
    "it has been shown in the literature ( see @xcite for a recent study and @xcite for earlier investigations ) that these sources will be dominated by detached white - dwarf  white - dwarf ( wd - wd ) binaries , with @xmath2 of such systems in our galaxy .",
    "the detached wd - wd binaries evolve by gravitational - radiation reaction and the number of such sources rapidly decreases with increasing orbital frequency . although it is expected that , above a certain frequency cut - off ( @xmath3 ) , we will be able to resolve individual signals and remove them from the lisa data , it is still not clear how to further improve the lisa sensitivity to other gravitational wave signals in the region of the frequency band below the wd - wd background frequency cut - off .",
    "although two promising data analysis procedures have been proposed @xcite for attempting to subtract the galactic background , considerable work still needs to be done to verify their effectiveness . in this context , simulating the lisa response to the wd - wd background will be particularly useful for verifying present and future data analysis `` cleaning '' algorithms .",
    "a realistic simulation will also quantify the effects of the lisa motion around the sun on the overall amplitude and phase of the gw signal generated by the background in the lisa data .",
    "the directional properties of the lisa response and its time dependence introduced by the motion of lisa around the sun , together with the non - isotropic and non - homogeneous distribution of the wd - wd binary systems within the galactic disk as seen by lisa , imply that the magnitude of the background observed by lisa will not be a stationary random process .",
    "as a consequence of the one - year periodicity of the lisa motion around the sun , there exist relatively long ( @xmath4 months ) stretches of data during which the magnitude of the lisa response to the background will reach an absolute minimum @xcite .",
    "our simulation shows this minimum to be less than a factor of two larger than the level identified by the lisa secondary noises , suggesting the possibility of performing searches for gravitational radiation from other sources located in regions of the sky that are away from the galactic plane .",
    "the lisa sensitivity to such signal in fact will be less limited by the wd - wd background during these periods of observation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ lisa_res ]",
    "we provide the analytic expression of one of the lisa time - delay interferometric ( tdi ) responses to a signal radiated by a binary system .",
    "although all the tdi responses to binary signals were first given in their closed analytic form in @xcite , in what follows we will focus our attention only on the unequal - arm michelson combination , @xmath5 . in section [ wd_pop ]",
    "we give a summary of how the wd - wd binary population was obtained , and a description of our numerical simulation of the @xmath5 response to it . in section [ simu ]",
    "we describe the numerical implementation of our simulation of the lisa @xmath5 response to the wd - wd background , and summarize our results .",
    "in particular , in agreement with the results by seto @xcite , we find the amplitude of the galactic wd - wd background in the lisa @xmath5-combination to be modulated in time , reaching a minimum when the sun - lisa direction is roughly oriented towards the autumn equinox .",
    "furthermore , we show the amplitude of the background at its minimum to be a factor less than two larger than the level identified by the lisa noise for a time period of about two months , suggesting that lisa could search ( during this time period ) for other gravitational wave signals incoming from regions of the sky that are away from the galactic plane .    the time - dependence and periodicity of the magnitude of the wd - wd galactic background in the lisa data implies that it is not a stationary but rather a cyclostationary random process of period one year . after providing a brief summary of the theory of cyclostationary random processes relevant to the lisa detection of the wd - wd galactic background",
    ", we apply it to three years worth of simulated lisa @xmath5 data .",
    "we find that , by measuring the generalized spectral components of such cyclostationary random process , lisa will be able to infer key - properties of the distribution of the wd - wd binary systems present in our own galaxy .",
    "the overall lisa geometry is shown in figure ( [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "there are six beams exchanged between the lisa spacecraft , with the six doppler measurements @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) recorded when each received beam is mixed with the laser light of the receiving optical bench . the frequency fluctuations from the six lasers , which enter in each of the six doppler measurements , need to be suppressed to a level smaller than that identified by the secondary ( proof mass and optical path ) noises @xcite in order to detect and study gravitational radiation at the predicted amplitudes .",
    "since the lisa triangular array has systematic motions , the two one - way light times between any spacecraft pair are not the same @xcite .",
    "delay times for light travel between the spacecraft must be accounted for depending on the sense of light propagation along each link when combining these data as a consequence of the rotation of the array . following @xcite ,",
    "the arms are labeled with single numbers given by the opposite spacecraft ; e.g. , arm @xmath8 ( or @xmath9 ) is opposite spacecraft @xmath8 , where primed delays are used to distinguish light - times taken in the counter - clockwise sense and unprimed delays for the clockwise light times ( see figure ( [ fig2 ] ) ) .",
    "also the following labeling convention of the doppler data will be used .",
    "explicitly : @xmath10 is the one - way doppler shift measured at spacecraft @xmath11 , coming from spacecraft @xmath8 , along arm @xmath12 .",
    "similarly , @xmath13 is the doppler shift measured on arrival at spacecraft @xmath8 along arm @xmath14 of a signal transmitted from spacecraft @xmath11 . due to the relative motion between spacecraft , @xmath15 in general . as in @xcite",
    ", we denote six further data streams , @xmath16 ( @xmath7 ) , as the intra - spacecraft metrology data used to monitor the motion of the two optical benches and the relative phase fluctuations of the two lasers on each of the three spacecraft .",

    "@xcite for a detailed discussion .",
    "the contribution @xmath17 due to gw signals was derived in ref .",
    "@xcite in the case of a stationary array , and further extended to the realistic configuration @xcite of the lisa array orbiting around the sun .",

( [ eq : x1 ] ) by permutations of the spacecraft indices . the semicolon notation shown in equation ( [ eq : x1 ] ) emphasizes that the operation of sequentially applying two or more delays to a given measurement is non - commutative as consequence of the time dependence of the light - times @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) , and a specific order has to be adopted to adequately suppress the laser noises @xcite . specifically : @xmath25 ( units in which the speed of light @xmath26 ) .    the expressions of the gravitational wave signal and the secondary noise sources entering into @xmath27 will in general be different from those entering into @xmath5 , the corresponding `` first generation '' unequal - arm michelson observable derived under the assumption of a stationary lisa array @xcite . however , the magnitude of the corrections introduced by the motion of the array are proportional to the product between the time derivative of the gw amplitude and the difference between the actual light travel times and those valid for a stationary array . at @xmath12",
    "hz , for instance , the larger correction to the signal ( due to the difference between the co - rotating and counter - rotating light travel times ) is two orders of magnitude smaller than the main signal . since the amplitude of this correction scales linearly with the fourier frequency , we can completely disregard this effect ( and the weaker effect due to the time dependence of the light travel times ) over the entire lisa band @xcite .",
    "furthermore , since along the lisa orbit the three armlengths will differ at most by @xmath28 1%2% , the degradation in signal - to - noise ratio introduced by adopting signal templates that neglect the inequality of the armlengths will be of only a few percent .",
    "for these reasons , in what follows we will focus on the expressions of the gw responses of various second - generation time - delay interferometry ( tdi ) observables by disregarding the differences in the delay times experienced by light propagating clockwise and counterclockwise , and by assuming the three lisa armlengths to be constant and equal to @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "these approximations , together with the treatment of the moving - lisa gw response discussed in @xcite are essentially equivalent to the _ rigid adiabatic approximation _ of ref .",
    "@xcite , and to the formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "these considerations imply that the second generation tdi expressions for the gravitational wave signal and the secondary noises can be expressed in terms of the corresponding first generation tdis . for instance",

[ fig : spec_comp],width=377 ]    , width=377 ]    our analysis has shown that the lisa data will allow us to compute @xmath307 independent cyclic spectra ( the @xmath258 complex cyclic spectra @xmath317 and the real spectrum @xmath318 ) of the wd - wd galactic background , @xmath308 of which can be expected to be measured reliably .",

    "<S> lisa ( laser interferometer space antenna ) is a proposed space mission , which will use coherent laser beams exchanged between three remote spacecraft to detect and study low - frequency cosmic gravitational radiation . in the low - part of its frequency band </S>",
    "<S> , the lisa strain sensitivity will be dominated by the incoherent superposition of hundreds of millions of gravitational wave signals radiated by inspiraling white - dwarf binaries present in our own galaxy . in order to estimate the magnitude of the lisa response to this background </S>",
    "<S> , we have simulated a synthesized population that recently appeared in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> our approach relies on entirely analytic expressions of the lisa time - delay interferometric responses to the gravitational radiation emitted by such systems , which allows us to implement a computationally efficient and accurate simulation of the background in the lisa data . </S>",
    "<S> we find the amplitude of the galactic white - dwarf binary background in the lisa data to be modulated in time , reaching a minimum equal to about twice that of the lisa noise for a period of about two months around the time when the sun - lisa direction is roughly oriented towards the autumn equinox . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that , during this time period , lisa could search for other gravitational wave signals incoming from directions that are away from the galactic plane . </S>",
    "<S> since the galactic white - dwarfs background will be observed by lisa not as a stationary but rather as a cyclostationary random process with a period of one year , we summarize the theory of cyclostationary random processes , present the corresponding generalized spectral method needed to characterize such process , and make a comparison between our analytic results and those obtained by applying our method to the simulated data . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , by measuring the generalized spectral components of the white - dwarf background , lisa will be able to infer properties of the distribution of the white - dwarfs binary systems present in our galaxy . </S>"
