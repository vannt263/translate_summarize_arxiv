    "an important and difficult problem in complex hyperbolic geometry is to determine the generators systems and finite presentations for the lattices in @xmath0 .",
    "the most frequent method is to construct a fundamental domain and use the poincar s polyhedron theorem .",
    "it should be pointed out that , even though fundamental domains of arithmetic lattices are well known to exist , their explicit determination in the context of the non - constant curvature setting of complex hyperbolic space is a difficult task .",
    "there is also a simple algorithm for one to get the generators of some lattices . in particular",
    ", we do not need to know the fundamental domain for the action of lattice on the complex hyperbolic plane .",
    "see the works @xcite . however , it is hard to get more information of the lattices by this method .",
    "there are not so many examples of explicit arithmetic lattices or non- arithmetic lattices of @xmath0 , see , for example , the works of mostow@xcite , falbel and parker@xcite , parker@xcite , deraux , falbel and paupert@xcite , deraux , parker and paupert@xcite .",
    "perhaps the first example for the complex hyperbolic space in two complex dimensions was due to picard @xcite , which we now call picard modular group .",

    "the picard modular groups @xmath9 can be considered as the natural algebraic generalization of the classical modular group @xmath10 .",
    "for @xmath11 the rings @xmath1 have euclidean algorithms and the corresponding groups @xmath12 are the euclidean picard modular groups .",
    "as is to be expected , these are much closer in properties to the modular group than in the non - euclidean cases .",
    "of particular interest are the group @xmath13 and @xmath14 , which are called the gauss - picard modular group and the eisenstein - picard modular group",
    ". however , the explicit algebraic or geometric properties such as generators , fundamental domains and presentations are still unknown in all but very few cases .",

    "we claim that the same feature shared by euclidean picard modular groups is that the quotient @xmath21 has only one cusp .",
    "this is achieved by showing that @xmath15 and @xmath20 has a subgroup with the same finite index .",
    "we will start with finding suitable generators of the stabilizer of infinity of @xmath20 and then construct a fundamental domain for the stabilizer acting on the boundary of complex hyperbolic space .",
