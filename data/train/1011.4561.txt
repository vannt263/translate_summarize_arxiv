    "first of all , one can observe that the solution of ( [ eq : nonlocal ] ) associated with a compactly supported initial datum does not converge , for large times , toward the traveling wave but it converges towards a more complicated structure ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the numerical simulation presented in b ) of figure [ fig : nonlocal1 ] shows that the solution of the evolution equation converges to a pulsating front , that is a function @xmath10 which is periodic in its second variable .",
    "these types of fronts typically arise in the framework of reaction - diffusion equations with periodic coefficients ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in a ) of figure [ fig : nonlocal1 ] , the solution seems to converge to the superposition of a traveling wave and a pulsating front , with two different speeds .",

    "when @xmath9 is small enough or when the fourier transform of the kernel @xmath21 is positive everywhere , the traveling wave connects @xmath0 to @xmath1 . but this leaves open the question to know whether for @xmath9 large , the traveling wave solution of ( [ eq : phi2 ] ) connects the ( dynamically ) unstable state @xmath0 to a stable periodic state or to the turing unstable state @xmath1 .",
