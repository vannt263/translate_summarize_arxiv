    "bundles of fibers , with a statistical distribution of breakdown thresholds for the individual fibers , are simple and interesting models of failure processes in materials .",
    "they can be analyzed to an extent that is not possible for most materials ( for reviews , see @xcite ) .",
    "we consider a bundle with a large number @xmath2 of elastic and parallel fibers , clamped at both ends . when the load on fiber @xmath3 is increased beyond a threshold value @xmath4 , the fiber ruptures .",
    "the breakdown thresholds @xmath4 for the separate fibers are assumed to be independent random variables with a probability density @xmath5 , and a corresponding cumulative distribution function @xmath6 : @xmath7 the mechanism for how the extra stress caused by a fiber failure is redistributed among the unbroken fibers must be specified .",
    "we study here the classical version , the equal - load - sharing model , in which a ruptured fiber carries no load , and the increased stress caused by a failed element is shared equally by all the remaining intact fibers in the bundle @xcite .",
    "if an external load @xmath8 is applied to a fiber bundle , the resulting failure events can be seen as a sequential process @xcite . in the first step all fibers that can not withstand the applied load break .",
    "then the stress is redistributed on the surviving fibers , which compels further fibers to fail , etc .",
    "this iterative process continues until all fibers fail , or an equilibrium situation with a nonzero bundle strength is reached . since the number of fibers is finite , the number of steps , @xmath0 , in this sequential process is _ finite_. in this paper we determine how @xmath0 depends upon the number of fibers and , more importantly , upon the stress @xmath9 , the applied external load per fiber , @xmath10    at a force @xmath11 per surviving fiber , the total force on the bundle is @xmath11 times the number of intact fibers .",
    "the expected or average force at this stage is therefore @xmath12 one may consider @xmath11 to represent the elongation of the bundle , with the elasticity constant set equal to unity .",
    "the maximum @xmath13 of @xmath14 corresponds to the value @xmath15 for which @xmath16 vanishes .",
    "thus @xmath17 we characterize the state of the bundle as _ subcritical _ or _ supercritical _ depending upon the stress value relative to the critical stress @xmath18 above which the bundle collapses completely .",
    "critical properties of fiber bundles have been discussed before , but with a signature different from the one that we use here , and always with the critical point approached from the subcritical side @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath19 that we focus on , however , exhibits critical divergence when the critical point is approached from _ either _ side . as an example , we show in fig .  1 @xmath19 obtained by simulation for a uniform threshold distribution .",

    "the figure is based on 1000 samples , each with @xmath21 fibers .",

    "let @xmath23 be the number of intact fibers at step no .",

    "iii is devoted to subcritical situations .",
    "simulation results are presented for two threshold distributions , the uniform and a weibull distribution , and these are compared with detailed analytic results .",
    "the theoretical analysis is , however , not limited to these special threshold distributions . in sec .  iv we summarize our results and discuss briefly the approximations involved",
    "we investigate first the supercritical situation , @xmath31 , with positive values of @xmath32 and start with the simplest model .      consider a bundle in which the failure thresholds are distributed according to the uniform distribution @xmath33 for this case the load curve ( [ load ] ) is parabolic , @xmath34 with the critical point at @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "simulation results for the uniform threshold distribution are presented in fig .  1 .",
    "the basic equation ( [ n ] ) takes the form @xmath37 this nonlinear iteration can be transformed into a linear one by the following procedure .",
    "introduce first @xmath38 into ( [ ntuni ] ) , with a result that may be written @xmath39 putting @xmath40 we have @xmath41 hence @xmath42 , with solution @xmath43 in the original variable the solution reads @xmath44 where @xmath45 has been used .",
    "( [ ntuni ] ) shows that when @xmath46 obtains a value in the interval @xmath47 , the next iteration gives complete bundle failure .",
    "taking @xmath48 as the penultimate value gives a lower bound , @xmath49 , for the number of iterations , while using @xmath50 in ( [ finaluni ] ) gives an upper bound @xmath51 .",
    "adding unity for the final iteration , ( [ finaluni ] ) gives the bounds @xmath52 and @xmath53 it is easy to show that @xmath54 . in fig .",
    "2a we show that these bounds nicely embrace the simulation results .",

    "the dashed lines represent the theoretical estimates ( [ tu ] ) , ( [ tl ] ) and ( [ estimatew ] ) .",
    "+ note that both the upper and the lower bound behave as @xmath55 for small @xmath56 .",
    "a rough approximation near the critical point is @xmath57      the uniform distribution is amenable to analysis to a degree not shared by other threshold distributions .",
    "therefore we now discuss how to handle other distributions , and we start by a special case , a weibull distribution of index @xmath58 , @xmath59 the critical parameters for this case are @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "simulation results for @xmath19 are displayed in fig .",
    "2b for the weibull supercritical case . the variation with the external stress @xmath9 is qualitatively similar to the results for the uniform threshold distribution .",
    "the interesting values of the external stress are close to @xmath62 , because for large supercritical stresses the bundle breaks down almost immediately .",
    "for @xmath9 slightly above @xmath62 the iteration function @xmath63 takes the form sketched in fig .",
    "3 .        fig .  3 .",
    "the iteration function @xmath64 for the weibull distribution ( [ weibull ] ) .",
    "here @xmath65 , slightly greater than the critical value @xmath66 + the iteration function is almost tangent to the reflection line @xmath67 and a long channel of width proportional to @xmath56 appears .",
    "the dominating number of iterations occur within this channel ( see fig .",
    "the channel wall formed by the iteration function is almost parabolic and is well approximated by a second - order expression @xmath68 here @xmath69 is the fixed point , @xmath67 , of the iteration at @xmath70 . with @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( [ quadr ] )",
    "takes the form @xmath73 with @xmath74 . in the channel @xmath75 changes",
    "very slowly , so we may treat the difference equation as a a differential equation : @xmath76 with solution @xmath77 thus @xmath78 is the number of iterations _ in the channel _ , starting with @xmath79 , ending with @xmath80 .",
    "this treatment is general and can be applied to any threshold distribution near criticality .",
    "although the vast majority of the iterations occur in the channel , there are a few iterations at the entrance and at the exit of the channel that may require attention in special cases .",
    "the situation is similar to type i intermittency in dynamical systems@xcite , but in our case the channel is traversed merely once .    for the weibull distribution",
    "the expansion ( [ quadr ] ) has the precise form@xmath81 where @xmath69 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 . for completeness we must also consider the number of iteration to reach the entrance to the channel .",
    "it is not meaningful to use the quadratic approximation ( [ b1 ] ) where it is not monotonously increasing , i.e. for @xmath85 . thus we take @xmath86 as the entrance to the channel , and add one extra iteration to arrive from @xmath45 to the channel entrance .",
    "( numerical evidence for this extra step : for @xmath70 the iteration ( [ it - w ] ) starts as follows : @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , while using the quadratic function with @xmath90 as the initial value , we get after one step @xmath91 , approximately the same value that the exact iteration reaches after two steps . ) with @xmath92 we obtain from ( [ tf - ti ] ) in the weibull case the estimate@xmath93 with @xmath94 and @xmath83 .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "2b that the theoretical estimate ( [ estimatew ] ) gives an excellent representation of the simulation data . near the critical point ( [ estimatew ] ) has the asymptotic form @xmath95 with the same critical index as for the uniform threshold distribution .",
    "the divergence is caused by the large number of iterations in the narrow channel in fig .",
    "3 . for a general threshold distribution such a channel",
    "will always be present , and therefore the divergence ( [ div ] ) is universal .",
    "moreover , the amplitude of @xmath96 , as well as an excellent representation of the complete @xmath19 function may , for a given threshold distribution , be obtained by the same procedure as used above for the weibull case .",
    "we now assume the external stress to be subcritical , @xmath97 , and introduce the positive parameter @xmath98 to characterize the deviation from the critical point .",
    "also in the subcritical situation a bundle with the uniform threshold distribution ( [ uniform ] ) can be analyzed analytically to a greater extent than for other distributions , and consequently we start with this case .      using a similar method as in the supercritical situation",
    "we introduce into ( [ ntuni ] ) @xmath99 as well as @xmath100 , with the result @xmath101 in this case @xmath102 is the useful substitution .",
    "it gives @xmath103 thus @xmath104 , i.e. @xmath105 starting with @xmath45 , we obtain @xmath106 and hence @xmath107 this corresponds to @xmath108 in the original variable .    apparently @xmath46 reaches a fixed point @xmath109 after an infinite number of iterations",
    ". however , our bundle contains a _",
    "finite _ number of fibers , and therefore only a finite number of steps is needed for the iteration to arrive at a fixed point @xmath110 of the integer iteration ( [ nt ] ) , @xmath111.\\label{intuni}\\ ] ] since @xmath112<x+1 $ ] a fixed point @xmath110 of ( [ intuni ] ) must satisfy @xcite @xmath113 it is interesting to note that ( [ intuni ] ) has in general several fixed points for a given value of @xmath9 . with @xmath21 and @xmath114 , for instance , there are nine fixed points , viz .",
    "@xmath115 , the complete set of integers within the interval ( [ nfix ] ) .",
    "since our iteration starts high at @xmath24 , with steadily decreasing values of @xmath23 , it will stop at the _ upper _ fixed point , the largest integer satisfying ( [ nfix ] ) .    as long as @xmath116 , which is fulfilled in our simulations",
    ", we may take @xmath117 as a good approximation to the upper fixed point ( in the example above ( [ app ] ) gives @xmath118 , compared with @xmath119 ) .    as a consequence we use @xmath120 as the final value in ( [ ntor ] ) .",
    "consequently we obtain the following estimate for the number of iterations to reach this value : @xmath121 we see in fig .",
    "4a that the simulation data are well approximated by the analytic formula ( [ subnorm ] ) .    for very large @xmath2 ( [ subnorm ] )",
    "is approximated by @xmath122 the critical behavior is again characterized by a square root divergence , in this case somewhat modified by a logarithmic term .",
    "again we use the weibull distribution ( [ weibull ] ) as an example threshold distribution .",
    "simulation results for the subcritical weibull distribution are shown in fig .",
    "4b .",
    "simulation results with subcritical stress for ( a ) the uniform threshold distribution , and ( b ) the weibull distribution ( [ weibull ] ) .",
    "the graphs are based on @xmath123 samples with @xmath21 fibers in each bundle .",
    "the dotted lines are the theoretical estimates , eq .",
    "( [ subnorm ] ) for the uniform distribution case , and eqs .",
    "( [ par1]-[par2 ] ) for the weibull case .",
    "+ forgetting for the moment the finiteness of the fiber bundle , the iteration ( [ n ] ) , @xmath124 will reach a fixed point @xmath125 after infinite many steps .",
    "the deviation from the fixed point , @xmath126 , will decrease exponentially near the fixed point @xcite : @xmath127 with @xmath128    for the weibull threshold distribution , in particular , @xmath129 and thus @xmath130 for the weibull case .",
    "if we allow ourselves to use the exponential formula ( [ exp ] ) all the way from @xmath45 , we obtain @xmath131    for a finite number @xmath2 of fibers the iteration will stop after a finite number of steps . it is a reasonable supposition to assume that the iteration stops when @xmath132 is of the order @xmath133 .",
    "this corresponds to take the left - hand side of ( [ fixw ] ) equal to @xmath134 .",
    "the corresponding number of iterations is then given by @xmath135 solving the weibull iteration @xmath136 with respect to @xmath9 and inserting into ( [ twsub ] ) , we obtain @xmath137",
    "these two equations represent the function @xmath19 on parameter form , with @xmath125 running from @xmath69 to @xmath138 . in fig .",
    "4b this theoretical estimate is compared with the simulation data .",
    "the agreement is satisfactory .    for @xmath139 ( [ par1 ] ) shows that @xmath0 is infinite , as it should be . to investigate the critical neighborhood we put @xmath140 with @xmath141 small , to obtain to lowest order @xmath142 this gives ,",
    "once more , the divergence @xmath143    for a general threshold distribution the same procedure may be followed . to use the exponential approach to the fixed point , as we have done ,",
    "may seem to be doubtful .",
    "but the rational is that for small @xmath9 the starting point @xmath45 is already rather close to the fixed point , while for larger @xmath9 it does nt matter much if the first few iterations is not described well by the exponential formula , since in any case the majority of the iterations occur close to the fixed point .",
    "a detailed numerical and analytic study of the relaxation dynamics in finite fiber bundles subjected to external loads is presented .",
    "the relaxation takes place in a number , @xmath19 , of steps : in each step all fibers weaker than the load per surviving fiber burst , and the relaxation proceeds until equilibrium is reached or until all fibers have failed . as function of the initial stress @xmath9",
    "the number of steps , @xmath19 , shows a divergence @xmath144 at the critical point , both on the subcritical and supercritical side .",
    "this is a generic result , valid for a general probability distribution of the individual fiber breakdown thresholds .    on the supercritical side @xmath19 for large @xmath2 ,",
    "is independent of the system size @xmath2 . on the subcritical side",
