    "the origin of these discrepancies could by due to isospin population of break - up fragments , their excitation energy and secondary decay procedure as well , but a pertinent discussion of this issue goes much beyond the limits of present paper .    to summarize , we investigated the possibility of inferring the symmetry energy coefficient from isoscaling observables in multifragmentation reactions .",
    "our results indicate that , in the limit of large systems and high excitation energies where the use of a grandcanonical approach is reasonable , eq .

    "may be interpreted as an effect of surface contributions to the symmetry energy .",
