    "using the parkes multibeam receiver burgay et al . reported the discovery of a 22ms pulsar , psr  j0737@xmath33039a , in a close binary system .",
    "the derived orbital parameters implied that the system consists of two neutron stars .",
    "@xcite , the short orbital period ( roughly 2.4hr ) coupled with the high orbital eccentricity ( 0.88 ) made this system the most rapidly merging neutron star binary yet discovered , with the eventual merger predicted to occur in approximately 85myr .",
    "this discovery was soon followed by the discovery of radio pulsations from pulsar a s binary companion , psr  j0737@xmath33039b , with a pulsation period of 2.8s @xcite .",
    "the fact that both stars are observed as radio pulsars , a kind of system that had not yet been found , further added to this system s uniqueness and allowed very sensitive , and famous , confirmation the predictions of einstein s general relativity using high precision measurements of the orbital motions of the two stars @xcite .",
    "the discovery of pulsed @xmath0-rayradiation from the millisecond pulsar psr  j0737@xmath33039a  @xcite further added to the value of this system as psr  j0737@xmath33039aoccupies a region on the @xmath4relatively devoid of @xmath0-raypulsars .",
    "psr  j0737@xmath33039ais the first mildly recycled millisecond pulsar yet observed to emit in @xmath0-rays .",
    "figure  [ fig : bestfits ] shows the radio and @xmath0-raylight curves ( lcs ) observed for psr  j0737@xmath33039aat 1.4ghz and @xmath50.1gev respectively .",
    "both lcs display a widely - spaced two - peak structure .",
    "note that two rotations of the pulsar are shown in the interest of clarity .",
    "-ray(top ) lcs for psr  j0737@xmath33039awith best - fit solutions for the og ( green ) and tpc ( pink ) geometric models .",
    "the vertical dashed and dash - dotted lines indicate the closest approach to the magnetic axis under the best - fit og and tpc models respectively @xcite.[fig : bestfits],scaledwidth=80.0% ]",
    "the first constraint on the viewing geometry of psr  j0737@xmath33039athat can be obtained from these lcs is that the two radio peaks are most likely associated with opposite magnetic poles as they are separated by about half a rotation in phase .",
    "this means that the inclination angle @xmath1between the magnetic and rotation axes of this pulsar is most likely close to 90@xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , the large radio - to-@xmath0 phase lagsuggests that the radio and @xmath0-rayradiation are produced in different regions of the magnetosphere .",
    "this large radio - to-@xmath0 phase lagis , however , very troublesome when trying to reproduce these lcs through model simulations .",
    "figure  [ fig : bestfits ] shows the best - fit lcs obtained for psr  j0737@xmath33039ausing the outer gap ( og @xcite ) and two - pole caustic ( tpc @xcite ) models for the @xmath0-rayemission alongside an empirical conal model @xcite for the radio emission @xcite . as can be seen in the bottom panel , the biggest difficulty when trying to fit these lcs is reproducing the large radio - to-@xmath0 phase lag , with the leading radio peak in the predicted lcs still lying too close to the trailing peak .",
    "in addition to the radio and @xmath0-raylcs there are also high quality radio polarisation data available for psr  j0737@xmath33039awith which the viewing geometry can be constrained .",
    "fitting these data using a modified rotating vector model @xcite yields a geometry consistent with the one found using the geometric models , with psr  j0737@xmath33039abeing an almost orthogonal rotator ( see table  [ tab : table1 ] ) .",
    "the last estimate of the geometric parameters to mention here is the one obtained by ferdman et al .",
    ", who studied six years of radio observations of psr  j0737@xmath33039a@xcite .",
    "the results of their study agree very well with the results of the other two approaches discussed above .",
    "+ . the green radio lc corresponds to a slot gap extending to a radius @xmath7 , where @xmath8is the light cylinder radius , and the dashed lc corresponds to @xmath9 . in both cases",
    "the large radio - to-@xmath0 phase lagcannot be reproduced . for illustration , we used @xmath10 and @xmath11.[fig : altmodel1],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=90.0% ]    llll method & @xmath1(@xmath6 ) & @xmath2(@xmath6 ) & source + geometic modelling & @xmath12 & @xmath13 & @xcite + polarisation data fitting & @xmath14 & @xmath15 & @xcite + radio analysis & @xmath16 & @xmath17 & @xcite +    the good agreement between the results yielded by the three independent approaches , as is summarized in table  [ tab : table1 ] , increases our confidence in the identification of psr  j0737@xmath33039aas an orthogonal rotator , but simultaneously poses a challenge to the models employed .",
    "neither the og nor tpc @xmath0-raymodels , when coupled with the conal radio model , are able to reproduce the large radio - to-@xmath0 phase lag .",
    "a refinement of the current models is clearly necessary , and we have already made some attempts to rectify the problem .",
    "the first alternative model invoked a low - altitude slot gap geometry for the radio emission ( see @xcite for the original slot gap model ) , coupled with the usual tpc model for the @xmath0-rays .",
    "this geometry is proposed in the context of a radio cone producing radio peaks that lead the caustic @xmath0-raypeaks .",
    "the profiles produced by this model still could not reproduce the radio - to-@xmath0 phase lagsatisfactorily , even though the lc shapes were still reasonable .",
    "figure  [ fig : altmodel1 ] shows fits obtained using this alternative model .    the second alternative model proposed , instead , a conal structure for both the radio and @xmath0-rayemitting regions , with the @xmath0-rayregion lying _ lower _ than the radio region .",
    "this configuration was motivated by the idea that the radio may indeed have a dominating leading peak , with the @xmath0-raylc leading the radio lc .",
    "it was however found that it is not possible to reproduce both the radio and @xmath0-rayprofile shapes simultaneously within the context of this model , leading us to abandon this scenario .",
    "the fits obtained using these preliminary alternate models may not be satisfactory , but they do point to interesting avenues of model refinement , e.g. , the investigation of non - uniform emissivities , such as patchy or one - sided radio cones , or non - aligned radio and @xmath0-raycones . the fact that these lcs are hard to fit using the established geometric models , coupled with the unique characteristics of the system within which this pulsar finds itself , suggests that there may be some form of interaction between the two pulsars , perhaps through their stellar winds . such an interaction may be observable through changes in the lcs at the orbital period , but thus far no such periodic phenomenon has been observed .",
    "it may also be the case that the stellar winds , and specifically the currents they constitute , perturb the usual magnetic field structure of the pulsars , and hence the geometry of the emitting regions .",
    "such perturbations are currently not included in the geometric models employed thus far , and an investigation into how these two pulsars interact may lead to valuable refinements to the current geometric models .",

    "<S> guillemot et al . recently reported the discovery of @xmath0-raypulsations from the 22.7  ms pulsar ( pulsar a ) in the famous double pulsar system j0737 - 3039a / b . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-raylight curve ( lc ) of pulsar a has two peaks separated by approximately half a rotation , and these are non - coincident with the observed radio and x - ray peaks . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the @xmath0-rayemission originates in a part of the magnetosphere distinct from where the radio and x - ray radiation is generated . </S>",
    "<S> thus far , three different methods have been applied to constrain the viewing geometry of pulsar a ( its inclination and observer angles @xmath1and @xmath2 ) : geometric modelling of the radio and @xmath0-raylight curves , modelling of the position angle sweep in phase seen in the radio polarisation data , and independent studies of the time evolution of the radio pulse profile of pulsar a. these three independent , complementary methods have yielded consistent results : pulsar a s rotation axis is likely perpendicular to the orbital plane of the binary system , and its magnetic axis close to lying in the orbital plane ( making this pulsar an orthogonal rotator ) . the observer is furthermore observing emission close to the magnetic axis . </S>",
    "<S> thus far , however , current models could not reproduce all the characteristics of the radio and @xmath0-raylight curves , specifically the large radio - to-@xmath0 phase lag . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we discuss some preliminary modelling attempts to address this problem , and offer ideas on how the lc fits may be improved by adapting the standard geometric models in order to reproduce the profile positions more accurately . </S>"
