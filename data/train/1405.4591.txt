    ", the numbers inside the parentheses are for each antibonding states , usually denoted the @xmath33 and @xmath3 manifolds , respectively .",
    "these bands below 1 ev were fitted by the tight - binding wannier function technique implemented in fplo .",
    "we obtained two important parameters : @xmath31 hopping @xmath34=1.32 ev and direct oxygen - oxygen hopping @xmath35=0.14 ev.@xcite the @xmath35 value is similar to that of baruo@xmath0 , but the value of @xmath34 is about 10% larger than that of baruo@xmath0,@xcite reflecting the wider extension of the @xmath8 orbital than the @xmath36 orbital .",
    "remarkably , in the band structure , there are three nearly dispersionless bands around the @xmath37 point , in addition to a flat band just above @xmath27 along the @xmath38 line , which often appears due to a lack of @xmath39 hopping in conventional perovskites.@xcite the former three bands lead to sharp peaks at 6 ev , 3.5 ev , and @xmath27 in the dos of fig .",

    "this van hove singularity enhances the magnetic instability ( see below ) .    to investigate the effects of soc",
    ", we carried out gga+soc calculations .",
    "the blowup band structure near @xmath27 denoted by ( red ) dashed lines in the bottom of fig . [ band ] shows a strength of soc of @xmath44 ev , as measured near @xmath27 , where soc affects considerably .",
    "this value is largely reduced from the atomic value @xmath21 ev due to the strong @xmath45 hybridization . including soc ,",
    "the flat @xmath31 antibonding band becomes more dispersive and shifts down , leading to making the van hove singularity blunted below @xmath27 , as shown in the pdos in fig .",
    "[ pmdos](c ) .",
    "this system becomes very three dimensional . as a result",
    ", the total dos @xmath46 becomes only a half of that of the gga nm , suggesting that the magnetic instability is significantly diminished by soc , as discussed below .",
    "the nm fermi surfaces ( fss ) colored with the fermi velocity are displayed in fig .",
    "fss of both gga and gga+soc consist of three pieces : two hole - like pieces and a @xmath47-centered spherical electron - like piece . neglecting soc",
    ", fss have more flat regimes in various directions , implying the possibility of a charge or spin fluctuation .",
    "the fss have much lower fermi velocity in the @xmath48 directions , reflecting the fact that bands at @xmath27 are quite dispersionless in the direction .",
    "however , our trials to obtain antiferromagnetic states of three typical types are always converged to nm or fm states in both gga and gga+soc .",
    "this would rule out the possibility of a spin fluctuation .",
    "considering the effects of soc , the most significant change occurs in the open fs surrounding the @xmath47-centered sphere , resulting in being an @xmath37-centered sandglass - like shape . in the fs ,",
    "most flat parts disappear , but some survive in faces toward the @xmath49 point .",
    "the @xmath49-centered fs is shrunk and becomes nearly spherical with a radius of @xmath50 , containing @xmath20.31 holes .",
    "the @xmath47-centered spherical fs becomes more isotropic , although nodules appear in the @xmath48 directions .",
    "the radius of the spherical fs decreases by @xmath210% to compensate for the reduction of the hole - like fss , and attains a radius of 0.9@xmath51 , containing about 0.76 electrons .",
    "transport properties can be studied with the fermi velocity and plasma frequency . for the gga case ,",
    "the root - mean - square of the fermi velocity is @xmath52 cm / s , a typical value for a metal .",
    "the plasma energy @xmath53 , which is proportional to @xmath54 , is 4.55 ev .",
    "the inclusion of soc increases @xmath55 to @xmath56 cm / s , which is consistent with the fact that the bands around @xmath27 become more dispersive .",
    "so , the magnitude of the plasma energies is similar to the case neglecting soc .      within gga , fm with a total moment of 0.85 @xmath15",
    "is energetically favored over nm , but the difference in energy is only 11 mev .",
    "we performed fixed spin moment calculations in gga to investigate the stability of the fm state .",
    "we obtained @xmath570.79 ev , leading to @xmath58 with @xmath59 states / ev - spin for fm .",
    "this value , above unity of the stoner criterion , is close to that of the cubic fm baruo@xmath0   with the similar moment.@xcite    the bottom of fig .",
    "[ band ] displays the enlarged fm band structure in gga , showing that the exchange splitting of the @xmath3 manifold is about 0.4 ev . remarkably , this value is identical to the strength of soc , resulting in a transition from fm to nm in this metallic @xmath1 system .",
    "whenever including soc,@xcite our trials always converge to nm , which is consistent with the experiment .",
    "although the strength of correlation is still unclear in this system , the linear specific coefficient ratio of @xmath60 can be a guide to determine whether correlation is considered . from @xmath46 obtained from gga+soc ,",
    "@xmath617.68 ( in units of mj / mol - k@xmath62 ) , which is consistent with a previous report.@xcite compared with the experiment value of @xmath63,@xcite the ratio of @xmath64 2 implies a moderate correlation strength in baoso@xmath0 .",
    "so , using the gga+u+soc approach , we applied the effective on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath65 to the os ion to inspect whether this system is close to a magnetic ordering .",
    "here , @xmath66 is hund s exchange integral .",
    "the change in the total spin moment is described with varying strength of @xmath67 in fig .",
    "[ mu ] . at @xmath67 as small as 0.6 ev , a magnetic moment emerges . assuming a typical @xmath68 ev for @xmath8 systems , the critical on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath69 is only 1.2 ev , which is obviously within the range of a reasonable @xmath70 value for heavy transition metals .",
    "this fact suggests that this system is in the vicinity of a spin - ordered state , which is consistent with the curie - weiss behavior in the susceptibility.@xcite also , as @xmath67 increases , the moment rapidly increases and reaches to the saturated value of @xmath22 @xmath15 at @xmath71 ev .",
    "however , this system remains metallic even for a very large @xmath72 ev in gga+u+soc , whereas a half - metallic state appears above @xmath73 ev for the case neglecting soc .",
    "a structure distortion of the @xmath74o@xmath7 octahedron from the ideal one reduces the strength of soc .",
    "so , one may expect a magnetic ordering to emerge in the orthorhombic perovskite caoso@xmath0 with relatively small structure distortion,@xcite since the nm ground state of the cubic baoso@xmath0   is purely due to effects of soc . in gga , fm with the moment of 0.82 @xmath15/os has lower energy by 6 mev / f.u .",
    "than nm , which is consistent with our fixed spin moment calculations .",
    "the obtained stoner parameter @xmath75 ev is a little smaller than in baoso@xmath0 , but @xmath76 is almost identical to that of baoso@xmath0 .",
    "this indicates similar magnetic tendencies in both caoso@xmath0 and baoso@xmath0 , when ignoring soc .",
    "figure [ coo_dos ] shows the blowup pdos in both gga and gga+soc , which indicate the exchange splitting of the @xmath3 manifold of about 0.3 and 0.1 ev for gga and gga+soc , respectively .",
    "this reduction of 0.2 ev is almost identical to the strength of soc in caoso@xmath0 , which is only a half of that of baoso@xmath0 .",
    "consistent with this reduction , the inclusion of soc reduces the moment by 50% and leads to a little magnetization energy , by only a few tenths of mev , although fm remains favored .",
    "a stoner parameter in gga+soc can be estimated by @xmath77 , which is a half of the gga value .",
    "our results suggest that the unusual magnetism , observed in the experiment , in the orthorhombic caoso@xmath0 results from emerging magnetic ordering induced by reducing the strength of soc .      through first principles calculations ,",
    "_ suggested that two types of jahn - teller distortions in a cubic and isovalent bafeo@xmath0 , which are related to an antiferroic distortion of either os or o ions along the @xmath78-axis , lead to a magnetic phase transition.@xcite in the cubic baoso@xmath0 , our calculations show that these distortions are energetically unfavored , which is consistent with the phonon dispersion ( see below ) .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , however , the measurement of the specific heat suggested an unusual behavior.@xcite thus , we carried out linear response phonon calculations for our gga optimized and a few compressed volumes , using both gga and gga+soc .",
    "within gga , we obtained several imaginary frequencies throughout all regimes ( not shown here ) .",
    "even for the inclusion of soc , most of these unstable modes still survive , as given in the top of fig .",
    "[ phonon ] .",
    "as often observed in cubic perovskites,@xcite there are unstable modes , corresponding to the tilting of oxygens ( triplet @xmath79 , 36@xmath80 @xmath81 ) and the rotation of in - plane oxygens ( singlet @xmath82).@xcite the latter appears at @xmath83 @xmath81 in the compressed volume .",
    "structure distortions involving these modes have been intensively investigated in several perovskites by amisi _",
    "et al . _ and he _ et al._,@xcite who suggest the gadolinium orthoferrite gdfeo@xmath0-type structural distortion as the stablest one . however , in baoso@xmath0   the gdfeo@xmath0-type distortion is energetically unfavored .",
    "the most unstable modes of doublet 180@xmath80 @xmath81 appear midway of the @xmath47@xmath84 line , and are involved in the transverse acoustic mode , in which a displacement of one of the planar oxygens along the [ 110 ] direction is dominant .",
    "there are a few additional unstable modes along the @xmath37@xmath47 and the @xmath47@xmath49 lines .",
    "the latter is similar to the instability of the transverse acoustic mode observed in the possible charge - density - wave ( cdw ) y@xmath0co .",
    "[ ] however , consistent with the strong three - dimensionality in baoso@xmath0 , no indication of cdw is observed in our calculations .",
    "we also performed these calculations with two compressed volumes , which are 4% and 8% smaller than the optimized value , to investigate effects of pressure on the instability .",
    "the former corresponds to the experimental value . as shown in the top of fig .",
    "[ phonon ] , most of the unstable modes remain nearly unchanged , indicating that volume contraction does not play an important role in the instability .",
    "the complicated phonon instability seems to be of interest , requiring further studies in both theoretical and experimental viewpoints , although this is not an issue covered in this research .    for comparison ,",
    "phonon calculations were carried out in the cubic baruo@xmath0 , which is cubic even at temperature as low as 10 k.@xcite the bottom of fig .",
    "[ phonon ] displays our results , which show very similar behavior to that of baoso@xmath0 .",
    "it is unclear yet why these phonon spectra show serious instabilities , although both the cubic baoso@xmath0  and baruo@xmath0 phases are experimentally stable .",
    "one possible scenario is that quantum fluctuations would stabilize the cubic phase in both systems , as discussed for some cubic perovskites.@xcite this is true , only when the difference in energy between the cubic phase and a distorted phase is very small .",
    "also , the instability may be related to the unusual behavior in the specific heat and the fact that these cubic systems can be synthesized only by a technique of extreme conditions .",
    "comparing the experimental linear specific heat coefficient @xmath85=18 mj / mol - k@xmath62 of caoso@xmath0   with our theoretical values , there is an enhancement of a factor of two to three , implying a moderate correlation . within the gga+soc+u approach",
    ", applying @xmath67 to os ions in caoso@xmath0   leads to an insulating state at @xmath866.8 ev via a half - metallic state at @xmath874 ev .",
    "it may imply that this system is near an insulating state , resulting in the atypical electrical properties of caoso@xmath0 .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the effects of soc on the magnetism of a few metallic @xmath13 systems synthesized recently .",
    "the cubic baoso@xmath0   shows a transition from a stoner - type fm to nm incurred by soc , of which the strength is identical to the exchange splitting of the @xmath3 manifold .",
    "however , at small @xmath41.2 ev in gga+soc+u calculations , a small magnetic moment revives , suggesting that baoso@xmath0   is an incipient magnet . on the other hand ,",
    "our results indicate that the orthorhombic and isovalent caoso@xmath0   is fm , since the structure distortion leads to reducing the strength of soc .",
    "we anticipate this fact to be true for the isostructural and isovalent sroso@xmath0 .",
    "these results are consistent with a spin - ordered state observed very recently in a distorted double perovskite sr@xmath88yiro@xmath7 with @xmath13 ir@xmath89 ions.@xcite our findings indicate that these systems are good examples to investigate the interplay between magnetism , lattice , soc , and correlation .",
