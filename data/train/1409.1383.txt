    "the phenomenon of electron positron pair production in the presence of an electric field was described quantitatively in the classic work of schwinger @xcite .",
    "he wrote down an expression for the probability of particle production ( per unit space time volume ) by solving the dirac equation in a uniform and constant background electric field @xmath5 and obtaining the electron green function .",
    "the expression is @xmath6 with @xmath7    a noteworthy feature is that there is an exponential damping with the mass of the electron which signifies that it is a tunneling phenomenon .",
    "thus for laboratory electric fields the magnitude is negligible and unobservable .",
    "schwinger s derivation treats the electric field as classical and also ignores higher order effects such as the coulomb force between the electrons .",
    "as shown in @xcite the presence of the coulomb potential modifies the solution for large values of the electric field .",
    "it is found that for @xmath8 , ( critical field ) , there is no potential barrier and hence no exponential suppression . in this approximation",
    "the potential has the form @xmath9 @xcite , where @xmath10 is proportional to the electric charge .",
    "when @xmath11    the maximum of the potential is zero and there is no barrier .",
    "it is clear that this is non perturbative in @xmath10 .",
    "one can then pose the same question in @xmath12 super yang - mills theory which is also in the coulomb phase . here in the planar strong coupling limit",
    "one can resort to the ads / cft correspondence and get an exact answer .",
    "again one finds a critical electrical field @xcite .",
    "this is also what one expects from string theory in flat space : an open string in an electric field is a quark - antiquark pair in an electric field .",
    "when the force due to the electric field is stronger than the string tension , the effective string tension becomes zero and one can expect unsuppressed production of quark antiquark pairs from the vacuum .",
    "the signal of this is that the dirac - born - infeld action becomes zero ( and starts to become imaginary ) at the critical electric field .",
    "one can ask whether this effect can be observed in condensed matter systems by its consequences on conductivity @xcite .",
    "the effect of schwinger pair production and its influences on conductivity was shown using holographic calculations in @xcite .",
    "probe branes representing flavor quarks were introduced in an ads - schwarzschild background and placed in an electric field and the conductivity was calculated @xcite .",
    "similar systems were also studied in @xcite .",
    "the electric field induced conductivity was found to be a non - linear function of the electric field , and more importantly the critical field turns out to be zero@xcite . in the bulk calculation the absence of a critical field can be traced to the warp factors .",
    "for an arbitrarily small electric field the warp factors reduce the effective tension of the string and at some value of the radial coordinate @xmath13 , the dbi action threatens to turn complex .",
    "it can be shown then that this unphysical behavior is resolved if one assumes that a non zero current is induced .",
    "this current is present even at zero temperature and can be attributed to the schwinger effect without , however , any exponential suppression . in the boundary theory",
    "this can be attributed to the strong coupling effects which reduce the critical field to zero . in ( [ ecrit ] ) , @xmath14 . ]",
    "it has also been shown that this effect can be described in terms of an effective event horizon at @xmath13 , not in the bulk metric , but in the open string metric on the brane @xcite .",
    "in fact many of the results derived for black hole backgrounds , such as the proof of the fluctuation dissipation theorem @xcite can be shown to be directly applicable in this situation also .",
    "there are situations , such as the one described in the sakai - sugimoto model @xcite , where the branes do not reach as far as @xmath15 . in this case",
    "this effect is not there and the material is insulating even when there is an electric field @xcite .",
    "for the boundary theory this implies that the quarks are too heavy and the strong coupling interactions are not sufficient to remove the barrier .    in the case",
    "that there is no barrier ( due to strong coupling effects ) , the pair production takes place `` classically '' i.e. no quantum mechanical tunneling is involved .",
    "one does nt really need the schwinger formula to calculate conductivity .",
    "this is the situation dealt with in the classical bulk calculations of @xcite .",
    "however one can ask the question whether , in the case where there is a barrier , as in the sakai - sugimoto model , where chiral symmetry breaking induces a quark mass and puts it in an insulating phase @xcite , one can really use the schwinger formula to calculate the conductivity .",
    "schwinger s calculation is a one loop calculation and since the quarks circulating in the loop transform in the fundamental of the color group rather than the adjoint , this is a @xmath16 effect - beyond the planar approximation .",
    "if one includes the schwinger correction ( exponentially suppressed ) to the maxwell action ( as calculated in @xcite ) this would induce corrections to conductivity that is proportional to the electric field .    in this paper",
    "we address this question .",
    "the maxwell action on the brane ( which is the leading term obtained in expanding the dbi action ) is modified by the addition of the one loop effective action , which in the presence of a background electric field has an imaginary part explicitly .",
    "if one calculates conductivity using the kubo formula , from the green s function , which can be evaluated by the usual ads / cft prescription , one expects a non zero real part .",
    "indeed this is what we find .",
    "thus we can conclude that what was thought to be an insulating phase actually has a small conductivity .    whether this is large enough to be observable",
    "experimentally depends crucially on the mass of the fermion . in metals",
    "the role of particle and anti particle is played by fermionic excitations at the fermi surface which is ungapped and one can expect such effects . in ordinary metals",
    "the dispersion relation is non relativistic and the schwinger formula would not be directly applicable although .",
    "moreover external electric fields are screened in metals .",
    "it has been suggested that systems such as graphene one can look for this effect @xcite . in graphene the electrons and holes are effectively massless at the `` dirac points '' and obey a relativistic dispersion relation .",
    "nevertheless the density of states is small enough that screening effect is not strong .",
    "also the rate may be large enough to be measurable @xcite",
    ". the holographic calculation would then be applicable in a strong coupling version of this .",
    "another interesting feature that arises in this calculation is that there are regions where the real part of the conductivity is negative .",
    "while this is unphysical ordinarily and would be a sign that the approximations are breaking down , this need not be so when there is a background electric field , from which energy can be pumped into the system .",
    "thus in semiconductor physics it is well known that , gunn diodes and tunnel diodes display negative differential resistivity in the presence of large external fields .",
    "a holographic calculation showing this phenomena has been done recently @xcite .",
    "our main point of departure is that we are working in a region where the phenomenon is due to a one loop effect in the flavor brane in the bulk .    in supersymmetric bps configurations of branes ,",
    "the low energy action is fixed by the symmetries .",
    "however when supersymmetry is spontaneously broken by finite temperature effects one can expect finite loop corrections .",
    "loop corrections can involve open strings with ( @xmath17 ) both ends on the flavor brane or ( @xmath18 ) with one end on the flavor brane and one end on the colored brane .    in case ( @xmath18 ) the loop diagram with an infinite number of massive modes running around the loop dualizes to a tree diagram involving closed string modes connecting the flavor and color branes ( see figure [ embed1 ] ) .",
    "one can see that they are of @xmath19 .",
    "these are the same class of diagrams that generate the ads background in the first place .",
    "so the question arise as to whether we are double counting .",
    "are these diagrams ( of type ( @xmath18 ) ) to be considered or are they already included when the flavor brane is placed in an ads space",
    "? in general it is the the uv limit of the open string loop that is reproduced by the graviton tree diagram .",
    "the finite part of the open string loop requires all the massive closed string tree diagrams .",
    "this continues to be true in the decoupling limit taken for the ads / cft correspondence . on the open string side ,",
    "on the brane , in the @xmath20 limit only the massless open string particles traverse the loop .",
    "however the closed string side still requires the full string theory and the massive modes also contribute and their effect survives in this limit @xcite .",
    "thus one is tempted to conclude that one has to explicitly calculate the finite part of a gauge theory loop diagram ( with colored particle in the loop ) on the brane placed in an ads background .",
    "the finite contribution in the presence of an electric field has an imaginary part corresponding to schwinger pair production . in situations where the open string metric develops a horizon such effects are seen , in the gravity dual , already at the tree level on the brane .",
    "but in general it is hard to imagine how an imaginary part can develop in an effective action except through loop effects .",
    "we leave the issue of type ( @xmath18 ) diagrams as an open question for the moment .    however diagrams of type ( @xmath17 ) are not included in the dual picture and must be computed - they are of order @xmath21 . as an example if we have two flavor branes separated by a small amount , we have @xmath22 broken to @xmath23",
    ". the effective action for the @xmath23 photon will get corrected by the loop with @xmath24 or its fermionic partners running around .",
    "this kind of symmetry breaking occurs for instance in the holographic description of strong coupling bcs theory @xcite .",
    "the actual calculation of these classes of diagrams is not very different - they differ only by an overall numerical factor which is of @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore while the original schwinger calculation involved only fermions in the loop in the supersymmetric theory there are fermions as well as bosons .",
    "the expressions for arbitrary spin are available in the literature @xcite . in this paper",
    "we are interested in probing the qualitative effects of the schwinger effect , so we restrict ourselves to the fermionic contribution .",
    "having discussed an overview and the motivation for our holographic study of schwinger pair production in strongly coupled system , here we briefly mention about the specific strategies we follow in the subsequent sections .",
    "our aim is to capture the effect of pair production process on the electrical conductivity in the context of sakai - sugimoto model . in section ( [ one ] )",
    ", we briefly discuss the holographic aspects of sakai - sugimoto model .",
    "the bulk gravity theory of sakai - sugimoto model is built on the consideration of @xmath26 number of flavor @xmath27 branes probing the near horizon geometry of type iia supergravity background corresponding to the @xmath28 number of color @xmath29 branes . using the @xmath30 brane picture",
    ", we describe how the model holographically allows a deconfined boundary phase with broken chiral symmetry . in section ( [ two ] )",
    ", we study the response of the sakai - sugimoto model to a constant electric background by turning it on inside the world volume of the probe @xmath27 brane .",
    "the dbi action of the probe @xmath27 brane is modified accordingly .",
    "moreover , we systematically consider some time dependent fluctuation over the constant electric background and construct the associated effective classical lagrangian as a leading maxwell term in the @xmath31 expansion of the modified dbi action .",
    "our aim is to add an one - loop effective action to this classical maxwell action and study the gauge field dynamics governed by the total action .",
    "it is important to mention that the quantum action we are interested in can be obtained by systematically covariantizing the one in four dimensional flat space time .",
    "therefore to accommodate the quantum action we need to dimensionally reduce the classical action to a four dimensional subspace of the @xmath27 world volume .",
    "the systematic recipe for adding the one loop effective lagrangian capturing the physics of schwinger pair production is described in section ( [ three ] ) .",
    "the schwinger pair of our interest is the quark antiquark pair associated with end points of the fundamental string joining either @xmath32 or @xmath33 brane stacks ( modulo the comments of the previous paragraph ) .",
    "furthermore , in section ( [ four ] ) by analyzing the quantum corrected effective lagrangian , we demonstrate the holographic method to compute the conductivity in the strongly coupled boundary theory . for the conductivity computation",
    "we require the information of retarded green s function . in this work",
    "we calculate the green s function using numerical methods .",
    "finally we plot the real part of the conductivity with the frequency of the fluctuating gauge field .",
    "we summarize our results and conclude with some remarks on our analysis in section ( [ five ] ) .",
    "sakai - sugimoto model provides a very successful holographic method to construct the type iia supergravity background , dual to the large @xmath28 qcd theory @xcite .",
    "the iia background includes a stack of @xmath28 color @xmath29 branes wrapping a @xmath34 circle .",
    "in addition to that , within probe approximation , @xmath26 number of flavor @xmath35 branes at two different points on the circle are also considered , accounting no back reaction on the @xmath29 geometry .",

    "the left ( right ) handed fermions come from the spectrum of @xmath38 flavor branes and they transform in the fundamental representation of both the color gauge group @xmath39 and the flavor gauge group @xmath40 .",
    "the above realization of the sakai - sugimoto model is valid at a energy scale far below the kaluza- klein mass scale .    in more detail",
    ", we consider the near horizon limit of the @xmath29 branes in the type iia string theory . if we set the curvature of space time @xmath41 and impose the limit @xmath42 , the metric structure takes the following form , @xmath43 where @xmath44 signifies the supersymmetry breaking scale of the theory , @xmath45 is the circular direction with the periodicity , @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the volume element of @xmath48 .",

    "therefore , in the boundary theory the deconfined phase with broken chiral symmetry turns out to be insulating .    in our work",

    ", it is sufficient for our purpose to keep the terms up to the quadratic fluctuations .    neglecting those terms which are either constant or linear in fluctuation , thus not contributing to the equation of motion and putting everything else together up to quadratic order we get the classical action for fluctuation , @xmath116 our aim is to write @xmath117 obtained by expanding dbi action up to quadratic order of fluctuation in a canonical four dimensional maxwell form .",
    "the motivation for imposing the restriction on space time dimension comes from the fact that at the end we aim to study the effect of schwinger pair production on electrical conductivity in a strong coupling phase by analyzing the dynamics of gauge field fluctuation governed by a quantum corrected action and the quantum contribution for the action we are interested in is originally constructed in @xcite for four dimensional flat space time . therefore to successfully accommodate the quantum correction we need the above mentioned dimensional reduction .",
    "to do so we proceed in the following way .",
    "first , by observing the factors under the square root in equation ( [ eqn1 ] ) we make an ansatz for a modified induced metric @xmath118 .",
    "this modified metric absorbs the extra factor coming due to the presence of constant electric background @xmath5 and reduces to the original one , @xmath107 in the @xmath119 limit .",

    "it is important to note that in doing so we make another assumption that one of the spatial boundary coordinates is wrapped in a circle and introduces another energy scale @xmath125 .",
    "for all subsequent part of this paper we restrict our analysis far below this newly introduced energy scale . redefining the coupling constant in a suitable way we finally land up with a four dimensional effective action in a canonical maxwell form .",

    "finally , we plot the real part of the conductivity with respect to the frequency for both small and large @xmath172 .",
    "for example , figure ( [ condfig11 ] ) and ( [ condfig22 ] ) show the variation of the real part of @xmath254 with respect to frequency for @xmath255 .",
    "we also show the same for @xmath256 in figure ( [ condfig33 ] ) . from both cases it is evident that if we increase the mass , the conductivity is less . on the other hand conductivity",
    "enhances with the external electric field . for large and small @xmath172 , real part of",
    "the conductivity seems to diverge periodically with respect to @xmath257 .",
    "the periodicity of this divergence almost remains constant as we vary the parameters @xmath149 and @xmath5 .",
    "for @xmath255 we observe that the conductivity takes negative value with respect to the higher values of frequency . for @xmath256 , the region of",
    "negative conductivity lies within the lower range of @xmath257 . for higher range of @xmath257",
    "it is positive and always periodically divergent . in fig ( [ condfig44 ] ) we have plotted the conductivity for three different values of @xmath258 keeping the electric field @xmath259 and @xmath260 fixed .",
    "we observe in this plot that for lower values of @xmath261 the real part of the @xmath254 takes negative values . as we increase the @xmath262 the conductivity is always positive .",
    "most importantly , the frequency of the peaks in conductivity plots scales as @xmath263 .",
    "these peaks may arises from the poles of the green s function and the corresponding frequency modes are well known as normal / quasi - normal modes . in the confined phase of sakai - sugimoto model , the normal modes determines the mass of the meson spectrum and the mass parameter turns out to be proportional to the kaluza - klein mass ( @xmath264 ) of the theory .",
    "since @xmath264 scales as the square root of @xmath265 , the period of normal modes also scales as @xmath266 . in our case , we have set the @xmath267 and in the deconfined phase the role of @xmath265 is played by the radius of horizon @xmath268 ( the @xmath269 subspace is a topologically cylinder ) .",
    "therefore the only relevant parameter to set the mass scale is @xmath270 . as we already observe that the periodicity of the frequencies where the conductivity ( evaluated numerically ) seems to diverge scales as @xmath263 .",
    "so it is tempting to conclude that these apparent numerical divergences are in fact poles appearing in the greens s function and actually characterize the quasinormal modes .",
    "in this paper we have discussed the effect of pair production in modifying the conductivity in strong coupling situations .",
    "the strong coupling theory is described holographically by a system of flavor and color branes .",
    "the flavor branes provide flavor quantum numbers to particles .",
    "the one loop schwinger effect modifies the effective action for a photon on the flavor brane . since the coupling constant @xmath271 is small , this one loop calculation is reliable .",
    "the photon is dual to a conserved current in the boundary theory .",
    "the current current correlator in the boundary is modified .",
    "this modifies the conductivity of the boundary theory .",
    "the interesting point is that because the schwinger effect introduces an imaginary part to the effective action , the modified conductivity in the boundary acquires a real part .",
    "thus an insulator starts to have a small real conductivity in the presence of an electric field .",
    "what is doubly interesting is that the differential conductivity for some range of parameters can be _",
    "negative_. this effect is known in condensed matter contexts in semiconductor diodes such as tunnel diodes and gunn diodes although the mechanism of negative differential resistance is specific to the device .",
    "here we have a strong coupling version of this .",
    "this is similar to the effect discussed in @xcite .",
    "the main difference is that in these papers the effect was already there at the classical level on the flavor brane because of the presence of an open string metric horizon . in our case",
    "there is no such horizon and shows up only at one loop",
    ".    it would be interesting to identify experiments analogous to those suggested in @xcite where the schwinger effect would be observable .",
