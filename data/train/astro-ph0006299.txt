    "as discussed in rosenberg et al .",
    "( @xcite , hereafter paper i ) , the heterogeneity of the data often used in the literature for large scale studies of the galactic globular cluster ( ggc ) properties has induced us to start a large survey of both southern and northern ggcs by means of 1-m class telescopes , i.e. the 91 cm european southern observatory ( eso ) / dutch telescope and the 1 m isaac newton group ( ing ) / jacobus kapteyn telescope ( jkt ) .",
    "we were able to collect the data for 52 of the 69 known ggcs with @xmath10 .",
    "thirty - nine objects have been observed with the dutch telescope and the data have been already presented in paper i. the images and the photometry of the remaining 13 ggcs , observed with the jkt are presented in this paper . a graphical representation of the spatial distribution of our cluster sample is given in fig .",
    "[ f : galdist ]    as a first exploitation of this new data base , we have conducted a ggc relative age investigation based on the best 34 cmds of our catalog ( rosenberg et al .",
    "@xcite , hereafter paper iii ) , showing that most of the ggcs have the same age .",
    "we have also used the data base to obtain a photometric metallicity ranking scale ( saviane et al .",
    "@xcite , hereafter paper iv ) , based on the red giant branch ( rgb ) morphology .",
    "there are many other parameters that can be measured from an homogeneous , well calibrated cmd data base : the horizontal branch ( hb ) level , homogeneous reddening and distance scales , etc .",
    "we are presently working on these problems .",
    "however , we believe it is now the time to present to the community the complete data base to give to anyone interested the opportunity to take advantage of it .    in the next section , we will describe the observations collected at the jkt in 1997 .",
    "the data reduction and calibration is presented in sect .",
    "[ dat ] , where a comparison of the calibration of the northern and southern clusters is also discussed for three objects observed with both telescopes . in order to assist the reader , in sect .",
    "[ parameters ] we present the main parameters characterizing our clusters . finally , the observed fields for each cluster , and the obtained cmds are presented and briefly discussed in sect .  [ cmds ] .",
    "the data were collected on may 30-june 2 1997 . for almost 2 nights we had quite good seeing conditions ( fwhm between 0.65 and 0.85 arcsec ) . unfortunately ,",
    "too few standards were observed during this run . in order to ensure an homogeneous calibration , we reobserved all the same cluster fields ( plus numerous standard fields ) in june 24 , 1998 , a night that was photometric and with a stable seeing .",
    "observations were done at the 1 m jacobus kapteyn telescope ( jkt ) , located at the roque de los muchachos observatory .",
    "the same instrumentation was used in both runs : a thinned tektronix ccd with @xmath11 pixels projecting 0.331 arcsec on the sky and providing a field of view of 5.6 arcmin square .",
    "the detector system was linear to @xmath12 over the full dynamic range of the 16 bit analog - to - digital converter .",
    "three short ( @xmath13 ) , two medium ( @xmath14 ) and one large ( @xmath15 ) exposures were taken for one field of each of the proposed objects in each filter .",
    "also a large number of standard stars were obtained during the second observing run .",
    "this was done in order to have all the clusters in exactly the same system , making internal errors negligible .",
    "the data were reduced following the same procedure described in paper i.    the absolute calibration of the observations is based on a set of standard stars of the catalog of landolt ( @xcite ) .",
    "eighteen standard stars were observed ; specifically , the observed fields were pg1525 , pg1633 , mark - a and pg2213 .",
    "at least 4 exposures at different airmasses were taken during the night for each standard field , making a total of @xmath16 individual measures per filter .",
    "thanks to the relatively stable seeing conditions , for the aperture photometry we used for all the standards ( and the cluster fields ) a 12 pixel aperture ( 4 arcsec ) .",
    "the aperture magnitudes were normalized by correcting for the exposure time and airmass . using the standards",
    "observed at different airmasses , we estimated for the extinction coefficients in the two filters : @xmath17 and @xmath18 . for the calibration curves we adopted a linear relation .",
    "the best fitting straight lines are : + @xmath19 ; + @xmath20 .",
    "+ the magnitude differences vs. the standard color are plotted in fig .",
    "[ f : calcurv ] , where the solid lines represent the above equations .",
    "apart from the 13 ggcs presented in the following sections , we re - observed three additional clusters selected from the southern hemisphere catalog presented in paper i. we covered the same spatial region , in order to test the homogeneity of the two catalogs created using the two different telescopes .    in fig .",
    "[ comparison ] the magnitudes of 170 stars ( with photometric error smaller than 0.025  mag and @xmath0 magnitude brighter than 18 ) in ngc  5897 from the jkt and the eso / dutch telescope data sets are compared .",
    "the differences in magnitude and color between the two observing runs are : @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 in @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath24 , respectively . for the other two clusters",
    ", we have : @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 for 163 stars selected in ngc  6093 , and @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 for 249 stars selected in ngc  6171 ( selection criteria as in the case of ngc  5897 )",
    ". moreover , the slopes of the color differences vs. both the magnitude and the color are always @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , the two catalogs must be considered photometrically homogeneous and the measures of the absolute and relative parameters of the cmds perfectly compatible .",
