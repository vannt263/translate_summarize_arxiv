    "in recent years observational evidence has been found for black holes , once considered to be hypothetical astrophysical objects .",
    "an interesting challenge is to find evidence for another type of strange object , the traversable wormhole , a tunnel - like structure connecting different regions of our universe or of different universes altogether .",
    "although just as good a prediction of einstein s theory as black holes , they have so far eluded detection . unlike black holes , holding a wormhole open requires the violation of the null energy condition , an example of which is the casimir effect @xcite . on the cosmological level , phantom dark energy also violates the null energy condition and could therefore give rise to wormholes @xcite .",
    "moving to the galactic level , we are confronted with other peculiar phenomena that can not be explained by the standard model , examples of which are the observed flat rotation curves in galaxies . in particular , the rotation curves of neutral hydrogen clouds in the outer regions can not be explained in terms of ordinary ( luminous ) matter .",
    "these phenomena have led to the hypothesis that galaxies and even clusters of galaxies are pervaded by some non - luminous matter , now called _",
    "dark matter_. dark matter is able to account for these flat rotation curves .",
    "the term _ dark _ refers to the fact that it does not emit electromagnetic waves , nor interact with normal matter .",
    "a number of candidates for dark matter have been proposed over time : new particles predicted by supersymmetry @xcite , massive neutrinos collectively known as wimps ( weakly interacting massive particles ) @xcite , a source of scalar fields @xcite , global monopoles @xcite , brane - world effects of gravitation @xcite , noncommutative geometry @xcite , geometric effects of @xmath1 gravity @xcite , @xmath2 gravity @xcite , etc .    to see how wormholes might fit in with these strange astrophysical phenomena , we begin by noting that navarro et al .",
    "@xcite have used @xmath3-body simulations to search out the structure of dark halos , in particular the density profile of dark halos in the standard cdm cosmology .",
    "their numerical simulations in the @xmath0cdm scenarios led to the density profile of galaxies and clusters of galaxies having the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the characteristic scale radius and @xmath6 the corresponding density .",
    "since this density profile of cdm halos of several masses ( between @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) fits accurately , we will rely on eq .",
    "( [ e : rho ] ) to show that the galactic halo may be able to support traversable wormholes .    in the present work , essentially we are motivated to show that the geometry of the space - time of a galactic halo may be described by a traversable wormhole metric , fitting with the expected density profile predicted by simulations and with the observed flat galactic rotation curves .",
    "while we now have the density profile , other properties of dark matter remain unknown .",
    "we will therefore assume that dark matter has the most general anisotropic energy - momentum tensor given by @xmath9 with @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 being the transverse and radial pressures , respectively .",
    "as noted earlier , the observed flat rotation curves of neutral hydrogen clouds in the outer regions of galaxies indicate the existence of dark matter . in such galaxies",
    "these neutral hydrogen clouds are therefore treated as test particles moving in circular orbits .",
    "the spacetime in the galactic halo is characterized by the line element @xmath13 a more convenient form for later analysis is @xmath14 a flat rotation curve for the circular stable geodesic motion in the equatorial plane yields @xmath15 derived in appendix 1 .",
    "here @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the rotational velocity and @xmath18 is an integration constant .",
    "the observed rotation curve profile in the dark matter region indicates that the rotational velocity @xmath19 is nearly constant .",
    "for example , for a typical galaxy of mass @xmath20 within 300 kpc @xcite , the rotational velocity is @xmath21  ( 300  km / s ) .",
    "so by letting @xmath22 , the spacetime metric becomes @xmath23    as shown in appendix 2 , the einstein field equations @xmath24 now yield @xmath25\\ ] ] and @xmath26 \\nonumber \\\\-\\frac { 8 \\pi \\rho_s r_s^2}{(\\frac{r}{r_s})^3 } \\left[\\ln \\left ( 1+\\frac{r}{r_s } \\right ) + \\frac{1}{\\left ( 1+\\frac{r}{r_s } \\right ) } \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it should be emphasized that this result is based on the two cosmological observations made earlier , the density profile , eq . ( [ e : rho ] ) , and the observed rotation curve profile .",
    "( the expression for the transverse pressures is given in appendix 2 . )",
    "having obtained both @xmath27 and @xmath28 , we are now in a position to examine the spacetime metric more closely . first recall that if the line element , eq .",
    "( [ e : line1 ] ) , is to represent a wormhole , then + 1 ) the _ redshift function _ , @xmath27 ,",
    "must remain finite to prevent an event horizon .",

    "+ 3 ) @xmath32 for @xmath33 .",
    "+    [ cols= \" > , < \" , ]     regarding these requirements , observe that eq .",
    "( [ e : line2 ] ) shows that the spacetime does not have an event horizon . to check the shape function",
    ", we will use a graphical approach by using some typical values of the parameters .",
    "1 ( left panel ) shows the following : the throat is located at @xmath34 , where @xmath35 cuts the @xmath36-axis . also , for @xmath37 , @xmath38 , which implies that @xmath39 , an essential requirement for a shape function .",
    "moreover , @xmath35 is a decreasing function for @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , @xmath41 , so that the the flare - out condition is satisfied .",
    "1 ( middle panel ) also supports this assertion .",
    "so all three conditions are satisfied . for the sake of completeness , observe that for the values in fig . 1 , @xmath42 and @xmath43",
    ", we obtain @xmath44 kpc to four decimal places with @xmath45 .",
    "our final task concerning the wormhole structure is to examine the null energy condition .",
    "this condition must be violated if the wormhole is to remain open @xcite .",
    "judging from fig .",
    "1 ( right panel ) , this is indeed the case since @xmath46 .    for a spacetime to be asymptotically flat",
    ", both @xmath27 and @xmath47 have to approach zero as @xmath48 .",
    "the second condition is satisfied , but not the first , as we can see from eq .",
    "( [ e : line2 ] ) .",
    "so the wormhole can not be arbitrarily large , which also applies to the halo region .",
    "the usual procedure is to cut off the wormhole material at some radial distance and join the solution to an external schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "it is also useful to calculate the active gravitational mass of the wormhole from the throat , @xmath49 ( in kpc ) up to the radius @xmath50 .",
    "this mass is given by @xmath51^r_{r_0}.\\ ] ] observe that the active gravitational mass @xmath52 of the wormhole is positive .",
    "this implies that seen from the earth , we would not be able to distinguish the gravitational nature of a wormhole from that of a compact mass in the galaxy .",
    "the generalized tolman - oppenheimer - volkov ( tov ) equation is @xmath53    according to ponce de len s suggestion @xcite , we rewrite the above tov equation ( 10 ) for the anisotropic mass distribution in the galactic halo , to the following form @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the effective gravitational mass from the throat to some radius @xmath36 and is given by @xmath56 this expression of mass can be derived from the tolman - whittaker formula and the einstein s field equations .",
    "it is quite natural that the modified tov equation ( 11 ) provides the information of the equilibrium condition for the wormhole subject to gravitational ( @xmath57 ) and hydrostatic ( @xmath58 ) plus another force due to the anisotropic nature ( @xmath59 ) of the matter comprising the wormhole .",
    "hence , for equilibrium the above equation ( 11 ) takes the form @xmath60 where , @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 the profiles of @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 for the matter distribution of the galactic halo region are shown in fig .",
    "the figure indicates that equilibrium stage can be achieved due to the combined effect of pressure anisotropic , gravitational and hydrostatic forces .",
    "it is to be noted that value of @xmath57 is too small .",
    "the other two plots reside nearly opposite to each other to make the system balanced .    .",
    "value of @xmath57 is too small .",
    "the minimally coupled massless wave equation in a wormhole background is given by @xmath64 = 0.\\ ] ]    note that for simplicity , we are dealing with minimally coupled scalar waves .",
    "since the wormhole spacetime is spherically symmetric , the equation related to scalar field can be solved by separation of variables , @xmath65 here @xmath66 are the spherical harmonics and @xmath67 is the quantum angular momentum .",
    "the possibility of astrophysical observations now provides the motivation for studying the scattering of scalar waves in our wormhole spacetime .",
    "such observations would be important for research on the gravitational radiation , as well as for determining the possible existence of actual physical wormholes .    using the separable form ( 18 ) in ( 17 )",

    "assuming the time dependence of the wave to be harmonic , one can write @xmath77 using ( 17 ) in ( 20 ) , we get the schrdinger equation @xmath78 \\widehat{u}_{l_0 } ( r,\\omega ) = 0.\\ ] ]    near the throat ( @xmath79 ) , the potential @xmath80 $ ] , which is finite .",
    "since the wormhole proposed here is not arbitrarily large , we assume that the wormhole material extends from the throat @xmath44 kpc to the radius @xmath81 kpc .",
    "for the value of @xmath82 , note that the magnitude of @xmath70 is negligible at @xmath83 kpc .",
    "this means that the solution has the form of a plane wave @xmath84 at the distance @xmath85 kpc .",
    "this result indicates that if a scalar wave passes through the wormhole , the solution would be changed from @xmath86 to @xmath87 .",
    "this confirms that the potential affects the scattering of scaler waves .",
    "we have shown in this paper that the galactic halo possesses some of the characteristics needed to support a traversable wormhole .",
    "the analysis is based on two observational results , the density profile from simulations performed in the @xmath0cdm scenario and the observed flat galactic rotation curves .",
    "the results should provide sufficient incentives for scientists to seek observational evidence for wormholes , all the more since our study is based on the rotational velocity @xmath88  ( 300  km / s ) and a mass of @xmath89 within 300 kpc , making our own galaxy typical enough to be a good candidate .",
    "we have briefly studied here balancing of the forces that provides the equilibrium configuration of the system and also proposed a possible detection of such wormholes by studying the scattering of scaler waves .",
