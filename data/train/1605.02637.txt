    "in other words , there exists an explicit finite procedure which takes as input the totally real field @xmath3 , an ideal @xmath6 ( encoded in bits in the usual way @xcite ) , and an even integer @xmath15 , and outputs a finite set of number fields @xmath16 and sequences @xmath17 encoding the hecke eigenvalues for each eigenform constituent @xmath18 in @xmath7 and @xmath19 .    in this article",
    ", we consider the first and essential case @xmath20 ; we believe it would be an interesting project to extend these efforts to include tabulation of hilbert modular forms of higher weight as well .",
    "the general strategy of the algorithm in theorem [ algthm ] is as follows .",

    "let @xmath33 be an eichler order of level @xmath8 and let @xmath34 .",
    "then by the theorem of eichler - shimura , and shapiro s lemma , we have a further isomorphism of hecke modules @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the @xmath37-eigenspace for complex conjugation .",

    ", these methods overlap when there is a prime @xmath44 which exactly divides the level @xmath8 .",
    "we use this to verify our calculations by computing with both the definite and indefinite method when it applies ; for more , see section 3 .",
    "in this section , we discuss the magma @xcite implementation of the above algorithms .",
    "these methods saw a first implementation over @xmath45 by david kohel , and they rely heavily on code for quaternion algebras over number fields , due to donnelly , markus kirschmer , nicole sutherland , and voight ( documented in work of kirschmer  voight @xcite ) .",
    "our algorithm has 6 main steps :    1 .",
    "precomputation 2 .   computing a basis 3 .",
    "hecke computation via reduction 4 .",
    "decomposition into newforms    we refer to dembl ",
    "voight @xcite for an explicit mathematical description , and here we provide some additional comments about the implementation .",
    "the first step of the algorithm involves precomputation steps that only depend on the field @xmath3 : that is to say , for all levels @xmath8 with @xmath46 , this step need only be performed once .",
    "for the definite method , the precomputation step involves determining a set of representatives for the right ideal classes in @xmath27 up to isomorphism .",
    "* we precompute the theta series of each left order @xmath27 in the set of ideal representatives , recording @xmath47 for a small set of values @xmath48 .",
    "this reduces the number of isomorphism tests of ideals when computing hecke operators below , but at the marginal additional cost of requiring the computation of left orders and representation numbers . * as computing inverses and colon ideals",
    "can also be time consuming , we compute for each representative right ideal @xmath49 a small element @xmath50 and a left ideal @xmath51 of prime power norm such that @xmath52 : then @xmath53 , and @xmath54 generates @xmath55 if and only if @xmath56 generates @xmath57 .    for the indefinite method , we compute a fundamental domain for the shimura curve associated to the maximal order , together with a presentation for the group @xmath58 @xcite .      to compute a basis of forms , we need fast algorithms for working with @xmath28 , and our efficient implementation treats the case where @xmath8 is prime and composite differently : in the latter we index elements @xmath59 \\in { \\mathbb p}^1({\\mathbb z}_f/{\\mathfrak n})$ ] according to divisor @xmath60 . with these representatives in hand , in the definite case",
    "we list orbits of @xmath28 under the action of the stabilizer groups and in the indefinite case we record the permutation action in the coinduced module .",
    "( if we were working in higher weight , and a nontrivial representation @xmath61 , we would put a copy of @xmath61 on each element of @xmath28 . )    for sanity , we also verify the dimension of the space using a dimension formula ( involving class numbers and embedding numbers ) .      for the computation of hecke operators , we use reduction on @xmath28 in the definite case and reduction theory in the fundamental domain in the indefinite case .      with hecke matrices in hand , we now outline the procedures used in our implementation to decompose a newspace as a direct sum of new simultaneous eigenspaces .",
    "let @xmath62 .",
    "we use the following properties .    1 .",
    "the hecke operators @xmath11 for @xmath44 coprime to @xmath8 all commute .",
    "the hecke eigenspaces in @xmath63 have distinct systems of eigenvalues for the operators @xmath11 with @xmath44 coprime to @xmath8 ( `` multiplicity one '' ) .",
    "we have @xmath64 , with the last term omitted if @xmath65 does not divide @xmath8 .",
    "these properties are standard : for ( 2 ) , see for instance work of shemanske and walling ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.6 ) , and ( 3 ) follows from standard facts about degeneracy maps ( the proof is a straightforward generalization of the classical proof ( where @xmath66 ) , and is omitted ) .    using ( 1 ) and standard linear algebra techniques , we decompose the space into hecke constituents corresponding to @xmath45-irreducible subspaces ( a direct sum of eigenspaces ) . as harmless as it may seem , this step is often the bottleneck in computation .",
    "finally , we show how to decompose a space into old and new subspaces . for a prime @xmath12",
    ", the @xmath44-old subspace @xmath67 of @xmath62 is the span of the images of all degeneracy maps @xmath68 .",
    "the old subspace @xmath69 is the sum of the spaces @xmath67 for primes @xmath70 .",
    "the newspaces @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the unique hecke - invariant complements of @xmath69 and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "now suppose we are given two hecke - modules @xmath63 and @xmath73 ( e.g.  @xmath74 and we wish to compute the hecke - submodule @xmath69 of @xmath63 consisting of all the irreducible hecke - submodules ( i.e.  simultaneous eigenforms ) of @xmath63 that arise from @xmath73 via degeneracy maps .",
    "in addition , suppose we know a priori the dimension of @xmath69 , as in property ( 3 ) . for a prime @xmath44 coprime to @xmath8 , the space @xmath69 is contained in the kernel of the characteristic polynomial of @xmath75 evaluated at @xmath76 .",
    "since we know the dimension , we may compute @xmath69 in this manner using finitely many primes @xmath44 , stopping when the intersection has the right dimension .",
    "one could obtain the complement @xmath71 by computing the hecke - invariant complement , requiring extra module - splitting effort .",
    "however , for present purposes , we do not need to know @xmath71 as a particular subspace of @xmath63 ; we merely need the hecke action on @xmath77 , which can be obtained using the quotient @xmath78 .",
    "alternatively , we can compute the degeneracy operators themselves , and then compute the orthogonal complement .",
    "now suppose that @xmath63 is a new subspace of dimension @xmath79 . by ( 1 ) , it contains @xmath79 simultaneous eigenvectors having distinct systems of eigenvalues , which we wish to determine . the hecke algebra @xmath80_{{\\mathfrak n}}$ ] is a commutative @xmath81-algebra which is generated by hecke operators @xmath11 with @xmath44 coprime to @xmath8 . therefore @xmath82 is a direct product of number fields , an tale @xmath45-algebra generated by a single primitive element . for practical purposes , one may find a primitive element by trial and error ( for instance taking simple combinations of the first few hecke operators ) , since the set of non - primitive elements must be sparse .",
    "then the simultaneous eigenspaces of @xmath63 are simply the eigenvectors associated to the primitive element .",
    "we compute for the totally real fields @xmath3 of degree @xmath83 with discriminant @xmath84 . note that if @xmath85 > 6 $ ] then @xmath86 by the odlyzko bounds ; indeed , the totally real field of degree @xmath87 of smallest discriminant is blank .    in this range ,",
    "the discriminant and degree of the field uniquely characterizes the field , with one exceptional pair : in degree @xmath88 , there are two fields of discriminant @xmath89 : one , with minimal polynomial @xmath90 has galois group @xmath91 and the other @xmath92 has galois group @xmath93 .",
    "( the first multiple discriminant for cubic fields is @xmath94 . )",
    "this gives a total of @xmath95 hilbert modular forms in the database . to save space",
    ", we did not include data for conjugate levels ; for consistency across the database , these were later added to the lmfdb , increasing the overall size of the data .",
    "the computation was performed using the vermont advanced computing cluster ( vacc ) .",
    "the odd degree fields , which used the indefinite method , took approximately 4 cpu years to compute .",
    "much of this time is spent computing atkin - lehner involutions and coping with higher class number issues .      as in remark",
    "[ jlrmk ] , in many situations we can employ either the definite or indefinite method . for example , if @xmath3 has odd degree and @xmath46 , then one can apply the definite method with a quaternion algebra @xmath21 ramified at all real places and the prime @xmath44 ; the hecke module computed is then @xmath96 . to compute a single space of forms ,",
    "the definite method runs more quickly than the indefinite method , but for tabulation one must use the indefinite method if one wants to compute with forms of square level ; it is also more efficient to use the indefinite method since for each quaternion algebra used one must repeat the precomputation step .",
