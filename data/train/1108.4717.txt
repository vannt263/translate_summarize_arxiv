    "the concept of squeezing in different systems has attracted significant attention due to its transparent physical meaning , related to the reduction of quantum fluctuations below some given threshold . although most of applications of squeezing are related to the improvement of measurements precision , squeezing intrinsically",
    "reflects the existence of some particular correlations between parts of a quantum system .",
    "since the squeezing parameters contains easily measurable first and second order moments of collective operators , this entails a successful application of squeezing criteria to detect quantum entanglement @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "historically , much attention has been paid to squeezing of the electromagnetic field modes or squeezing in @xmath2 - or spin - like - systems .",
    "recently , more complex experiments on quantum systems having higher symmetries have been proposed , particularly in relation to some possible applications to quantum information processes .",
    "candidate qutrit systems described by the group @xmath3 include bose - einstein condensates and three  level atomic ensembles interacting with quantized fields .    the definition of squeezing , while universal for harmonic oscillator  like systems , is otherwise far from unique . in spin - like systems",
    "there are several approaches used to define a squeezing parameters @xcite .",
    "all parameters compare fluctuations of some suitably chosen observables with a certain threshold given by fluctuations in some reference state ( or family of states ) .",
    "the coherent states of the corresponding quantum system are often taken as the family of reference states .",
    "one of the crucial properties of coherent states is the invariance of the fluctuations of some observables under certain type of continuous transformations .",
    "this property allows the definition of the so - called quantum standard limit @xcite .    in this article",
    "we use this property of coherent states to introduce the concept of squeezing for systems with @xmath1 symmetry ( the extension to systems with @xmath4 symmetry can also be done ) .",
    "the main idea consists in defining the full family @xmath5 of collective operators ( which in practice are some linear combinations of generators of the @xmath0 algebra ) for which the fluctuations evaluated using @xmath1 coherent states are invariant under the same group transformation that leaves invariant the fiducial state used to construct the set of coherent states .",
    "we will show that , for a hilbert space carrying an irreducible representation of @xmath1 of the symmetric type , we can use @xmath6 continuous parameters @xmath7 to label a generic element @xmath8 , but fluctuations of @xmath9 , when evaluated using a suitable @xmath1 coherent state , are isotropic , _",
    "i.e. _ do not depend on @xmath7 .",
    "considering these ( invariant ) fluctuations as defining our threshold , we introduce squeezing as a reduction of fluctuations below the limit of these isotropic fluctuations in coherent states .",
    "since our objective is to show how @xmath1 squeezing can emerge rather than propose a general criterion , we will focus on the deformations of probability distributions resulting from the hamiltonian evolution of an initial coherent state . geometrically , a group transformation obtained by exponentiating a linear combination of generators and acting on a state produces a simple rigid displacement of the associated probability distribution and is not associated with the introduction of correlations .",
    "a deformation of the probability density does mean that quantum correlations between parts of the system are generated ; hence quantum correlations which generate the squeezing can only arise from non - linear interactions .",
    "as the characteristic times needed to produce such correlations are inversely proportional to some power of the dimension of the system , correlations develop very rapidly and the analysis can be done using semi - classical methods . in this article",
    "we will use the @xmath1 wigner function method @xcite to describe a non - linear evolution of a quantum system with the @xmath1 symmetry group .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section ii we briefly recall general ideas on the coherent states for systems with @xmath2 and @xmath1 symmetries and construct the operators with isotropic fluctuations in the corresponding coherent states . in section iii we analyze squeezing generated by a simple non - linear @xmath1 hamiltonian . in section",
    "iv the @xmath1 wigner function formalism is presented and applied to find the evolution of the squeezing parameter under the non - linear hamiltonian .",
    "following the general construction @xcite a coherent state for a system with a given symmetry group @xmath10 acting irreducibly in a hilbert space @xmath11 is defined as a fiducial state displaced by a group transformation in @xmath10 .",
    "we take this fiducial state to be the highest weight state of the irreducible representation carried by @xmath11 .",
    "the highest weight state is invariant ( up to a phase ) under transformation from the subgroup @xmath12 , so displacements of this state are labelled by points @xmath13 on the coset @xmath14 . the latter is known to be the classical phase space of the corresponding quantum system @xcite .",
    "below , we briefly review coherent states for the @xmath2 and @xmath1 groups , focusing only on the symmetric representations . in this case",
    "a coherent state can be considered as a composite state , occurring as a direct product of identical `` single particle '' states of systems with 2 or 3 energy levels , and invariant under permutation of the `` particle '' labels . in other words ,",
    "coherent states can be conveniently thought of as symmetric ( under permutation of particles ) factorized states , thus displaying maximal _ classical _ correlations . given any coherent state we can always find a operator written as linear combination of generators such that the fluctuations of this operator evaluated in the coherent state is invariant with respect to the transformations generated by the stationary subgroup @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , the fluctuations of this operator reach a value determined by the dimension of @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath16 algebra is spanned by @xmath17 , with non - zero commutation relation = s _ , = 2s_z .",
    "a basis for the irrep @xmath18 of dimension @xmath19 is spanned by the states @xmath20 .",
    "the basis states satisfy s_jm = j , m1 , s_zjm = mjm .",
    "the highest weight state is @xmath21 .",
    "it is invariant ( up to a phase ) under the subgroup @xmath22 .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 ranges between @xmath24 and @xmath25 when @xmath26 is even , and between @xmath24 and @xmath27 when @xmath26 is odd .",
    "we can now define a family @xmath28 of observables through = \\{t()s_xt^-1 ( ) } , t()=^-is_z .",
    "a typical element of the family is s()t()s_xt^-1()=s_x+s_y . for any @xmath29",
    "we find , using @xmath21 , that @xmath30 , independent of the element @xmath31 .",
    "the standard set @xmath32 of @xmath2 coherent states of angular momentum @xmath18 is defined as@xmath33where @xmath34 .",

    "@xmath35 is completely specified geometrically through the direction @xmath36 of the mean spin vector @xmath37:@xmath38    a property of coherent states essential to us is the existence of a special tangent plane orthogonal to the direction @xmath39 .",
    "if we define a direction vector @xmath40 as @xmath41 , we find @xmath42 for any @xmath43 .",
    "the observable s_(,;)n_()s = d(,)t ( ) s_xt^-1()d^-1 ( , ) satisfies ( s_(,;))^2=j [ inv_cs ] independent of the angles @xmath44 and @xmath43 when evaluated using @xmath45 .",
    "we will use the condition ( [ inv_cs ] ) to fix the threshold of quantum fluctuations and use this to define spin squeezing as was done by many authors @xcite : a state of angular momentum @xmath18 is squeezed if there is an orientation of @xmath46 in the tangent plane , defined for @xmath47 , for which @xmath48      for @xmath0 we consider symmetric irreducible representations of the type @xmath50 .",
    "the algebra is spanned by the six ladder operators @xmath51 and two cartan elements @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "a convenient realization is given in terms of harmonic oscillator creation and destruction operators for mode @xmath54 by @xmath55 acting on the harmonic oscillator kets @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",

    "the highest weight state @xmath61 is invariant ( up to a phase ) under transformations of the type @xmath62 , which generate a @xmath63 subgroup .",
    "coherent states are labeled by points on @xmath64 .",
    "thus , using @xmath65 as coordinates on @xmath66 , we generate the coherent state @xmath67 in the standard form @xcite as orbit of the highest weight @xmath61 under the action of the displacement operator on @xmath68 @xmath69this coherent state can also be represented as a product of @xmath70 one - qutrit states @xmath71    @xmath67 is completely determined by a `` mean vector '' @xmath39 with ( complex ) components @xmath72(a vector with @xmath73 real components is obtained using @xmath74 and @xmath75 . ) with @xmath76it is easy to verify that the variance of the observable @xmath77where @xmath78 when evaluated using the highest weight state @xmath61 , is @xmath70 and independent of the angles @xmath79 .",
    "hence , the variance of @xmath80when evaluated using the coherent state @xmath81 , is also independent of the `` direction '' @xmath82 in the `` tangent hyperplane '' perpendicular to @xmath83 , and equal to @xmath70 .",
    "thus , we will use @xmath84 as our squeezing threshold and define an @xmath0 state @xmath85 as squeezed if there is an observable of the form @xmath86 for which @xmath87 when evaluated in @xmath85 .",
    "squeezing related to a given algebra of observables is understood to reflect correlations ( commonly called quantum correlations ) between components of a basis of an irrep .",
    "as mentioned before group transformations , obtained by exponentiating linear combinations of elements from the algebra , produce rigid displacements of the basis states .",
    "correlations between basis states can not as a matter of definition be induced by such group transformations .",
    "rather , correlations can be either constructed through a special preparation , or obtained as a result of non - linear ( in terms of the algebra of observables ) transformations ( usually from non - linear hamiltonian evolution ) applied to initially uncorrelated systems .    in the case of large systems",
    ", it is convenient to analyze the evolution using the phase - space approach .",
    "the reasons are twofold : we can not only represent the initial state as a real - valued function and `` draw '' it ( for some appropriately chosen cuts ) in the form a distribution `` covering '' some slices of the phase - space , but more importantly also deduce many qualitative features of the time - evolution of this distribution . for a wide class of quantum systems with a symmetry group @xmath88",
    ", the phase - space functions are defined through an invertible map @xcite , so that we associate to an operator @xmath89 a phase - space symbol @xmath90where the quantization kernel @xmath91 is a hermitian operator defined on the classical manifold @xmath92 and @xmath93 denotes the phase - space coordinates .",
    "a feature of this mapping is that the commutator of two elements @xmath89 and @xmath94 of the lie algebra @xmath95 corresponding to the group @xmath88 is mapped to the poisson brackets of the respective symbols : @xmath96\\propto \\{w_{x},w_{y}\\}_p.\\ ] ] the commutator of two generic operators is in general mapped to the so - called moyal bracket .    for @xmath1 irreps of the type @xmath49 and @xmath97 , and for sufficiently localized initial states in a class dubbed `` semiclassical '' @xcite , @xcite , the short time",
    "dynamics can be well described by the liouville  type equation for the evolution of the wigner function : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the wigner function , _",
    "i.e. _ the symbol of the density matrix @xmath100 of the system , @xmath101 is the symbol of the hamiltonian , and @xmath102 is the so  called semiclassical parameter .",
    "the poisson bracket is in fact , the leading term in an expansion of the moyal bracket in inverse powers of the square root of eigenvalue of one of the casimir operators in the @xmath1 irrep @xmath49 ; we found that , for the mapping defined in @xcite on @xmath103 the semiclassical parameter @xmath104 is @xmath105    the solution of ( [ ee1 ] ) can be written in general form as @xmath106where @xmath107 denotes classical trajectories on @xmath103 .",
    "the approximation of dropping in eqn.([ee1 ] ) higher order terms in @xmath104 describes well the initial stage of the nonlinear dynamics , when self - interference is negligible .",
    "in physical applications , semiclassical states often have the form of localized states ( _ e.g. _ coherent states ) and their `` classicality '' depends on non - invariance under the transformations induced by symmetry subgroups of the ( nonlinear ) hamiltonian ( `` classicality '' is a subtle and delicate question not addressed here ) @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the method of the wigner functions allows us to calculate average values of the observables giving drastically better results than the `` naive '' solution of the heisenberg equations of motion with decoupled correlators . on the other hands , the quantum phenomena which are due to self - interference ( like schrdinger cats )",
    "are beyond the scope of this semiclassical approximation .      from the parametrization of the coherent state of eqn.([su3coherentstate ] ) , we deduce a poisson bracket on @xmath108 , given by @xmath109 where @xmath110 and @xmath111 are any two functions on @xmath103 .    following the prescription of @xcite , we associate to an operator @xmath112 a phase - space symbol @xmath113 according to eq.([map ] ) .",
    "this map is linear on @xmath89 so we only need to consider the phase space symbols of a basis set constructed from @xmath0 tensors @xmath114 , which transforms under conjugation by @xmath115 as the state @xmath116 in irrep @xmath117 transforms under @xmath111 notational details can be found in @xcite .",

    "note that weights in @xmath49 and @xmath125 are multiplicity ",
    "free so the triples @xmath126 and @xmath127 are enough to uniquely identify the states .    for irreps of the type @xmath128 ,",
    "some weights occur multiple times and the label @xmath129 , which specifies transformation properties of the states under @xmath2 transformations generated by @xmath130 , is required to fully distinguish states with the same weights .",
    "the tensors @xmath131 are proportional to the generators of the @xmath0 algebra .",

    "the wigner function corresponding to @xmath137 is given by @xmath138with @xmath139 a legendre polynomial of order @xmath140 .",
    "for @xmath141 , we have found , with much similarity to the @xmath2 case @xcite , that @xmath142 is well approximated by @xmath143where @xmath144 is a constant obtained so that the normalization condition @xmath145is satisfied . the approximate expression ( [ approxwf ] )",
    "does not describes very well the tail of the wigner function , but for our purposes this is not essential .",

    "this choice of @xmath152 is motivated on the following physical grounds .",
    "the operator @xmath153 is invariant under the _ same _ @xmath154 transformations that leave the highest weight invariant . squeezing resulting from its evolution",
    "is thus a pure @xmath1 effect , distinct from @xmath2 correlations that are present in the individual @xmath154 subspaces contained in @xmath49 .",

    ".    typical squeezing times scale as @xmath163 @xmath164 and are much shorter than self - interference times .",

    "we constructed the hamiltonian in a such way that it does not produce a rigid motion of the initial state , so we can use as observables those having uniform fluctuations in a coherent state as a reference to detect squeezing .",
    "although we have not established a general criteria for @xmath1 squeezing , we have shown how quantum correlations ( in the sense described above ) can lead to a reduction of fluctuations , which is reflected through a specific deformation ( `` squeezing '' ) of the initial coherent state .",
