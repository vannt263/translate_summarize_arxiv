    "the temperature of the central stars of planetary nebulae ( pns ) is an essential parameter for evolutionary studies as well as for an analysis of the nebulae themselves .",
    "the different methods for the determination of the stellar temperature and the problems involved were extensively discussed by pottasch ( 1984 ) and kaler ( 1985a , 1989 ) .",
    "the most common method was suggested by zanstra ( 1931 ) and further developed by harman & seaton ( 1966 ) .",
    "the temperature of the ionizing star of a planetary nebula is calculated from the ratio between the flux of a recombination line and the stellar continuum flux at a given frequency .",
    "the zanstra method assumes that all photons above the h ( or the he@xmath2 ) lyman limit are absorbed within the nebula and that each recombination eventually results in a balmer photon .",
    "the total ionizing flux can then be related to the total flux of a recombination line .",
    "the zanstra method yields then two values for the stellar temperature : the zanstra temperature obtained from the intensity of a hydrogen recombination line , t@xmath1(h ) , and the zanstra temperature obtained from a he ii recombination line , t@xmath1(he ii ) . when applied to observed nebulae , t@xmath1(h )",
    "is generally lower than t@xmath1(he ii ) ; the difference can reach values of the order of 60,000 k ( kaler 1983b ) , and the temperature ratio can reach a factor higher than 3 ( kaler 1983b , 1985a ) .",
    "this is the well known zanstra discrepancy , which is stronger for pns with low stellar temperatures .",
    "in fact , many pns with t@xmath1(h ) @xmath3 100,000 k have t@xmath1(he ii ) @xmath4 t@xmath1(h ) while , for higher stellar temperatures , both zanstra temperatures are similar ( pottasch , 1984 ; gathier & pottasch 1988 , 1989 ) .",
    "another important point is that the calculated zanstra temperatures do not reproduce the high temperatures predicted by evolutionary models ( kaler 1985a , 1989 ; stasiska & tylenda 1986 ) .",
    "another interesting feature that could be related to the zanstra temperature issues is the distribution of objects in a log l - log t plane . as noted by shaw & kaler ( 1989 ) ,",
    "when this distribution is based on zanstra temperatures there is a dense crowd of planetary nebula nuclei with temperatures of @xmath5 100,000 k and a strong decrease towards higher temperatures , what these authors call the `` zanstra wall '' .",
    "the causes of the zanstra discrepancy have been discussed by several authors ( pottasch 1984 ; kaler 1985a , 1989 ; henry & shipman 1986;stasiska & tylenda 1986 ; kudritzki & mndez 1989 ; gabler , kudritzki & mndez 1991 ; mndez , kudritzki & herrero 1992 ) and can be related to the following effects : ( 1 ) optical effects , i.e. , nebulae exhibiting a zanstra discrepancy would be optically thin to photons ionizing h yet optically thick to those ionizing he@xmath2 ; ( 2 ) differential dust absorption in the nebula ; ( 3 ) the stellar continuum differing from the usually assumed blackbody spectrum ; for example , an excess of photons with energies beyond the he@xmath2 ionization potential would result in a high he ii zanstra temperature .    objects with a large discrepancy show fainter low - ionization lines , suggesting that the effect 1 is the correct interpretation ( kaler 1983b ) .",
    "simple evolutionary models of planetary nebulae predict t@xmath1(h ) @xmath6 t@xmath1(he",
    "ii ) during the nebula lifetime because of the variation of their optical depth ( tylenda et al . 1994 ; see also sch \" onberner & tylenda 1990 ) . the effect of dust on the calculated zanstra temperature is discussed by helfer et al .",
    "( 1981 ) . for an assumed absorption law",
    "( with a high opacity around 50 ev ) , zanstra temperatures underestimate the actual stellar temperature .",
    "the effect is more intense for t@xmath1(h ) and leads to the zanstra discrepancy .",
    "however , dust appears to be only important in some specific nebulae ( kaler 1985a ) .",
    "departures from the blackbody , in particular an excess of photons beyond the he@xmath2 ionization potential , are suggested by observational studies of many central stars of planetary nebulae ( kaler 1985a ; see also references in henry & shipman 1986 ) .",
    "an ionizing spectrum with an excess of high energy photons ( relative to a blackbody ) , produced by a star with a less than solar atmospheric he abundance , leads to a he ii zanstra temperature higher than t@xmath1(h ) ( henry & shipman 1986 ) .",
    "detailed theoretical analyses , using photoionization models and applied to optically _ thick _ nebulae , are presented by stasiska & tylenda ( 1986 ) and henry & shipman ( 1986 ) .",
    "stasiska & tylenda ( 1986 ) show that for low stellar temperatures ( t@xmath0 @xmath7 100,000 k ) , both zanstra temperatures are similar",
    ". for higher stellar temperatures , t@xmath1(hi ) is larger and t@xmath1(he ii ) is lower than t@xmath0 .",
    "however , this result is opposite to what is obtained from observations .",
    "analyzing only models with t@xmath0 @xmath7 150,000 k , henry and shipman ( 1986 ) conclude that t@xmath1(h ) is a good measure of the stellar temperature .",
    "in fact , for these values of t@xmath0 , t@xmath1(h ) and t@xmath1(he ii ) are similar ( stasiska & tylenda 1986 ) and provide a good stellar temperature estimation _ if the nebula is completely optically thick_.    other methods for determining the stellar temperature include modelling of stellar absorption line profiles , ionic ratios , fitting of model atmospheres , the energy balance or stoy method , stellar uv energy distribution , etc . the results from these different methods were compared with the values given by the zanstra method in order to explain the zanstra discrepancy ; however , these methods give discordant results and have many uncertainties ( see , for instance , kaler 1985a , stasiska & tylenda 1986 , and kaler 1989 ) .",
    "many authors have adopted t@xmath1(he ii ) as representative of the stellar temperature assuming that the zanstra discrepancy is due to an optical depth effect ( kaler 1983b ; gleizes , acker & stenholm 1989 ; kaler , shaw & kwitter 1990 ; kaler & jacoby 1991 ; stanghellini , corradi & schwarz 1993 ) .",
    "however , t@xmath1(he ii ) may not be a good indicator of the stellar temperature since it never reaches values as high as predicted by theoretical stellar evolutionary studies .",
    "usually the discussion of the zanstra discrepancy in terms of an optical depth effect is based on optically thin _ or _ thick nebulae at 13.6 ev or 54.4 ev .",
    "it is also implicitly assumed that the nebula is optically thick at 54.4 ev at a distance to the central star smaller than that corresponding to 13.6 ev .",
    "harman & seaton ( 1966 ) suggest the following criteria for the complete absorption of h@xmath8 , he@xmath8 , and he@xmath2 ionizing - photons : presence of [ oi ] lines , he i images smaller than h i images , and he@xmath9 fractional abundance @xmath7 0.75 , respectively . for pottasch ( 1984 ) the zanstra method must work for @xmath10 @xmath4 1 .",
    "some authors define a criterion to distinguish between optically thin and thick objects using the ratio of the zanstra temperatures , zr = t@xmath1(he ii)/t@xmath1(h ) . for example , for shaw & kaler ( 1985 ) the nebula is optically thick to the h lyman continuum when zr @xmath11 1.2 , while for zr @xmath12 2.5 and he ii @xmath134686/h@xmath14 @xmath12 0.9 it is thin for he@xmath2 lyman continuum photons , t@xmath1(he ii ) being a lower limit for the stellar temperature .",
    "the criterion used by kaler & jacoby ( 1989 ) , based on line intensities of low - ionization lines , states that a nebula is thick when [ o ii ] @xmath133727/h@xmath14 @xmath15 1 and [ n ii ] @xmath136584/h@xmath16 @xmath15 1 .",
    "however , planetary nebulae can present a large range of optical depths , depending on the quantity of matter .",
    "furthermore , even considering the central stellar radiation as a blackbody , different stellar temperatures correspond to different ratios between the number of ionizing photons with energy higher than 54.4 ev and those higher than 13.6 ev . thus , the radial ionic distribution for h and he varies with t@xmath0 , changing the relative sizes of the h@xmath2 and he@xmath9 zones with the nebula optical depth at 13.6 ev and 54.4 ev . as remarked by stasiska & tylenda ( 1986 ) ,",
    "the radiation transfer is much more complicated than assumed by the zanstra method .    in brief , the zanstra temperature is commonly used in the literature for planetary nebula modelizations as well as evolutionary analysis , and low optical depth must be at least a partial explanation for the zanstra discrepancy .",
    "however , a more detailed analysis is required in order to explain the issues listed above . in this paper , a careful analysis of the effect of the nebula optical depth on the determination of the zanstra temperatures is intended .",
    "the effects on the zanstra temperatures due to deviations of a blackbody spectrum and due to an overabundance of he in the nebula are also discussed .",
    "the theoretical models used in our analysis are described in  2 .",
    "the results for the zanstra temperature ratio ( zr ) and its behavior with the stellar temperature and with the nebula optical depth appear in  3 , which also includes a comparison with values derived from pns observations .",
    "an alternative method to estimate the temperature of central stars of planetary nebulae is suggested and discussed in  4 .",
    "the conclusions are outlined in  5 .",
    "models for typical planetary nebulae are generated with the photoionization code aangaba ( gruenwald & viegas 1992 ) .",
    "the physical conditions of the gas are determined by solving the coupled equations of ionization and thermal balance for a spherical symmetric cloud .",
    "several processes of ionization and recombination , as well as of gas heating and cooling , are taken into account .",
    "the transfer of the primary and diffuse radiation fields is treated in the `` outward - only '' approximation . for the radiation - bounded models ( equivalent to completely optically thick nebulae ) , the calculations stop when the fractional abundance h@xmath2/h reaches 10@xmath17 , defining the maximum radius for the ionized nebula , r@xmath18 .",
    "matter - bounded models ( with a nebula radius less than r@xmath18 ) will also be discussed .",
    "the input parameters are the ionizing radiation spectrum , the gas density , and the chemical abundance for the elements included in the calculations ( h , he , c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , cl , ar , and fe ) . a range of input parameters , typical of planetary nebulae ( pottasch 1984 ) , is assumed : t @xmath15 50,000k , l@xmath0 = 30 - 20,000 l@xmath19 and n@xmath20 = 10@xmath21 - 10@xmath22 @xmath23 . in order to discuss the zanstra temperature for very hot stars , which are predicted by evolutionary models , a maximum stellar temperature of 500,000 k",
    "is adopted .",
    "a blackbody spectrum is assumed for the ionizing radiation , but the effects due to departures from this kind of spectrum will also be discussed . concerning the chemical abundances , average values for planetary nebulae , as given by kingsburgh & barlow ( 1994 ) , are assumed . for elements not given by these authors ,",
    "the solar value is adopted ( grevesse & anders 1989 ) .",
    "the he ii @xmath134686 and h@xmath14 fluxes obtained for the theoretical nebulae are used to derive t@xmath1(h ) and t@xmath1(he ii ) by the standard zanstra method .",
    "for each set of input parameters , t@xmath1(h ) and t@xmath1(he ii ) are calculated for different values of the nebula optical depth at the h lyman limit .",
    "in the following section , the assumed energy distribution of the ionizing radiation is fixed ( blackbody ) .",
    "thus , any discrepancy between the temperature adopted for the central star , t@xmath0 , and the derived zanstra temperatures is not due to the assumed spectrum but inherent to the method .",
    "our results show that t@xmath1(h ) reproduces fairly well the stellar temperature for _ optically thick nebulae",
    "_ ionized by a star with t@xmath0 @xmath3 150,000 k , in agreement with henry & shipman ( 1986 ) and stasiska & tylenda ( 1986 ) . for higher stellar temperatures , t@xmath1(h ) is greater than t@xmath0 , and the difference between these two values increases with t@xmath0 .",
    "these results agree with those of stasiska & tylenda ( 1986 ) .",
    "we find , however , that the deviation of t@xmath1(h ) relative to t@xmath0 is slightly smaller .",
    "as already discussed by stasiska & tylenda ( 1986 ) the deviation of zanstra temperatures from the stellar temperature is due to the fact that each he@xmath9 recombination gives more than one photon that ionizes h , and the proportion of photons ionizing he@xmath2 increases with the stellar temperature .",
    "furthermore , a fraction of the high energy photons are in fact absorbed by h and not by he@xmath2 .",
    "a detailed discussion on the generation of h ionizing photons following the he@xmath2 and he@xmath9 recombination can be seen in osterbrock ( 1989 ) .      before discussing the influence of the nebula optical depth on the derived zanstra temperatures ,",
    "it is useful to illustrate how the relative sizes of the h@xmath2 , he@xmath2 , he@xmath9 str \" omgren spheres change as a function of the stellar temperature .",
    "the variation of the fractional abundances of h and he ions with the position in the nebula is shown in terms of r / r@xmath18 in figure 1a ( left panels ) where r is the distance from the center of the nebula and r@xmath18 is the maximum dimension of the ionized region ( see  2 ) .",
    "the results given in figure 1 correspond to models with l@xmath0 = 3000 @xmath24 and n@xmath20 = 10@xmath25 @xmath23 . for low stellar temperatures",
    "the he@xmath9 str \" omgren radius , r@xmath26 , is much smaller than r@xmath27 or r@xmath28 , as expected .",
    "however , as t@xmath0 increases , r@xmath26 approaches r@xmath28 .    for a matter - bounded nebula ( with a total extent less than r@xmath18 ) the emitting zones of h@xmath2 , he@xmath2 , and he@xmath9 can be smaller than their corresponding str \" omgren spheres . in this case",
    ", the emitted line intensities will be lower than those emitted by a radiation - bounded nebula . for a given reduction of the nebula extent ,",
    "the size of the emitting zones of each of these ions will be differently affected , depending on the temperature of the central star .",
    "for nebulae with low stellar temperatures , a reduction of the nebula size affects mainly the h@xmath8 , h@xmath2 , and he@xmath8 zones .",
    "thus , the smaller the nebula radius , the lower t@xmath1(h ) , while t@xmath1(he ii ) may still be a good indicator of the stellar temperature . for increasing stellar temperatures ,",
    "the volumes of the h@xmath2 and he@xmath9 zones tend to be equal ( fig .",
    "1a ) . in this case",
    "a reduction of the nebula size can result in a matter - bounded nebula where the h@xmath2 and he@xmath9 zones are almost equally affected . in this case ,",
    "both t@xmath1(h ) and t@xmath1(he ii ) underestimate the stellar temperature .",
    "the possible underestimate of the stellar temperature , due to the fact that a nebula may not be radiation - bounded , can be discussed as an optical depth effect . if the nebula has not enough material to be radiation - bounded , its radius is smaller than r@xmath18 , and the nebula optical depth at a given frequency will be lower than the optical depth of a radiation - bounded nebula . the reduction of the nebula radius ( creating a matter - bounded nebula ) will differently affect the nebula optical depth of the h@xmath8 , he@xmath8 , and he@xmath2 continua .",
    "the fractional ionic distribution of h and he ions with the optical depth at the h lyman limit ( @xmath10 ) is shown in figure 1b . as seen in  3.1 , for a radiation - bounded nebula with low t@xmath0 the he@xmath9 str \"",
    "omgren radius is much smaller than the h@xmath2 str \" omgren radius .",
    "thus matter - bounded nebulae can have an optical depth at the h lyman continuum , @xmath10 , close to unity , while the optical depth at the he@xmath9 lyman limit , @xmath29 , is much higher .",
    "the object is then optically thin to the h - ionizing photons and optically thick to the he@xmath2-ionizing photons , leading to zr higher than 1 . in this case , t@xmath1(he ii ) provides a better estimate of the stellar temperature . as the stellar temperature increases , the optical depth at the h and he@xmath2 lyman limits tend to have similar values",
    "; both will be reduced if the radius of the nebula is smaller than that of a radiation - bounded nebula . in this case , neither t@xmath1(h ) nor t@xmath1 is a good indicator of the stellar temperature .",
    "the effect of the nebula optical depth on the derived zanstra temperatures is shown in a zr versus t@xmath1(he ii ) plot ( figs .",
    "2a and 2b ) for the same models as in figure 1 .",
    "each solid line corresponds to models with a given stellar temperature ; the nebula optical depth decreases with increasing zr .",
    "the curves are labeled by the stellar temperature in units of 1000 k. the dashed curves connect the results of completely optically thick models ( radiation - bounded nebulae ) with different stellar temperatures ; these results correspond to the minimum zr value for a given stellar temperature .    recalling the ionic distribution shown in figures 1a and 1b ,",
    "the behavior of zr shown by the curves in figure 2 can be easily understood : ( 1 ) for t@xmath0 @xmath3 150,000 k , the he@xmath9 zone is inside the h@xmath2 zone and much smaller .",
    "matter - bounded models with decreasing @xmath10 would result in weaker h@xmath14 emission line , while the he ii @xmath134686 line is unchanged .",
    "thus , starting at the minimum value , corresponding to the optically thick model , zr increases while t@xmath1(he ii ) is practically constant .",
    "when the optical depth is low enough to affect the he@xmath9 zone , zr still increases but t@xmath1(he ii ) decreases and the curves turn to the left ; ( 2 ) for higher stellar temperatures , the decrease of t@xmath1(he ii ) with @xmath10 happens closer to the optically thick value ( the volumes of the h@xmath2 and he@xmath9 zones are similar ) and zr increases slowly . in each of the solid lines in figure 2a ,",
    "the points corresponding to @xmath10 = 1 , @xmath10 = 10 , and @xmath29 = 1 are indicated , respectively , by crosses , triangles , and dots .",
    "notice that for t@xmath0 @xmath4 200,000 k , a nebula can be optically thin for he@xmath2-ionizing photons , even for zr @xmath5 1 , though thick for photons above the h lyman limit .",
    "the theoretical results also show that the zanstra method tends to underestimate the stellar temperature .",
    "the effect is larger for higher stellar temperatures , even for high optical depths .",
    "this may explain the `` zanstra wall '' in the log l - log t plot , since high - temperature stars , predicted by stellar evolutionary models , are penalized by the zanstra method .",
    "values for zr and t@xmath1(he ii ) derived from observations for a large sample of pns are plotted in figure 2b in order to be compared to the theoretical results . for each object",
    "several values of the zanstra temperatures can be found in the literature .",
    "the criteria used to select the objects and the values of the zanstra temperatures plotted in figure 2b are the following : ( 1 ) if the zanstra temperatures coming from different authors are similar ( difference less than 20@xmath30 from the average value ) , their average value is taken ; ( 2 ) if the same author presents discordant data for the same object , the more recent value is taken ; ( 3 ) if all the data for a given object are discordant , the object is not included .",
    "the values for both zanstra temperatures were taken from : martin ( 1981 ) ; kaler ( 1983b ) ; pottasch ( 1984 ) ; reay et al .",
    "( 1984 ) ; shaw & kaler 1985 ; viadana & de freitas pacheco ( 1985 ) ; de freitas pacheco , codina & viadana ( 1986 ) ; gathier & pottasch ( 1988 , 1989 ) ; gleizes at al .",
    "( 1989 ) ; jacoby & kaler ( 1989 ) ; shaw & kaler ( 1989 ) ; kaler et al .",
    "( 1990 ) ; kaler & jacoby ( 1991 ) ; mndez et al .",
    "since we are discussing the standard zanstra method , zanstra temperatures corrected by the stasiska - tylenda effect ( 1986 ) were not included .",
    "most of the observational points for zr and t@xmath1(he ii ) are inside the region defined by the theoretical curves that correspond to ionizing stars with a blackbody spectrum .",
    "our results naturally explain the trend shown by the observational values : for lower h zanstra temperatures ( @xmath7 100,000 k ) many planetaries may have t@xmath1(he ii ) @xmath4 t@xmath1(h ) , i.e. , zr @xmath4 1 , while for higher temperatures the difference between these temperatures is smaller .",
    "such a behavior , referred to as `` strange '' by pottasch ( 1984 ) , induced gathier & pottasch ( 1988 ) to discard the optical depth explanation , since nebulae with higher stellar temperature should be older and optically thinner .",
    "the distribution of zr versus t@xmath1(h ) presents a similar trend .",
    "notice that a decreasing zr ratio with increasing t@xmath1(h ) was obtained by gathier & pottasch ( 1988 ) with a sample including fewer objects .",
    "the variation of the stellar temperatures with the optical depth in figure 2 can solve some problems raised in the literature .",
    "one such problem is the temperature of the ionizing star of ngc 1360 .",
    "the zanstra temperatures for this object ( 34,900 k and 79,300 k , from the references given above ) are much smaller than the temperature obtained from uv measurements ( 100,000 k ; pottasch et al .",
    "1978 ) . in figure 2b",
    "the position of this object is in the region where the lines are crowded ; the nebula is thus optically thin and the star can have a higher temperature than that given by t@xmath1(he ii ) , as suggested by the uv data .",
    "also , the discussion ( kaler & hartkopf 1981 ) regarding a43 ( a thin and high - excitation nebula with a low he ii zanstra temperature star ) and a50 ( medium excitation , thick and high t@xmath1 ) must be reviewed , since , following our results ( figure 2 ) , the central star of a43 can have a temperature much higher than t@xmath1(he ii ) .      in the previous section , using the results from photoionization models corresponding to a given value of the stellar luminosity and gas density and assuming a blackbody spectrum for the ionizing radiation , it was shown that the main issues concerning the zanstra temperatures can be explained by an optical depth effect . in the following discussion",
    "the results for different values for the stellar luminosity and/or the gas density , as well as for an ionizing radiation spectrum deviating from a blackbody shape , are presented .",
    "first , still adopting a blackbody spectrum , we discuss the results corresponding to the whole range of adopted values for the stellar luminosity and gas density .",
    "we verified that , as long as t@xmath0 @xmath3 200,000 k , the behavior of zr with t@xmath1(he ii ) is the same as discussed in   3.1 and 3.2 , for t@xmath0 @xmath15 200,000 k and @xmath10 @xmath4 1 , models with low stellar luminosities ( @xmath7 100 l@xmath19 ) _ and _ low gas density ( @xmath3 10@xmath31 @xmath23 ) can give zanstra temperatures lower than those obtained with the standard models discussed above .",
    "the differences between the zanstra and stellar temperatures increase with increasing t@xmath0 and decreasing values for l@xmath0 and n@xmath20 .",
    "for example , for t@xmath0 = 300,000 k , a maximum difference occurs for @xmath10 @xmath5 10 , l@xmath0 = 10 l@xmath19 , and n@xmath20= 100 @xmath23 , when both zanstra temperatures decrease by @xmath5 20 @xmath30 , increasing the difference between zanstra and effective stellar temperatures",
    ". however , only a few pns would have such low stellar luminosities _ and _ gas densities .",
    "a number of authors explain the zanstra discrepancy by an excess of photons with energy above 54.4 ev in the ionizing spectrum .",
    "this could explain the high values of t@xmath1(he ii ) compared to t@xmath1(h ) .",
    "as discussed by henry @xmath32 shipman ( 1986 ) , observations and models imply an excess of photons beyond the he@xmath2 threshold in numerous planetary nebula nuclei .",
    "such an excess could be produced by a stellar atmosphere with subsolar he abundances and would lead to t@xmath1(he ii ) higher than t@xmath1(h ) when compared with models where a blackbody is assumed .",
    "to show the effect of a spectrum presenting an excess of high - energy photons above 54.4 ev , we discuss the results of photoionization models with an ionizing radiation spectrum of a pure h atmosphere ( wesemael et al .",
    "for example , for a completely optically thick nebula around a 150,000 k star , t@xmath1(he ii ) is 6@xmath30 higher and t@xmath1(h ) is 13@xmath30 lower compared to the corresponding blackbody results . for decreasing optical depths ,",
    "the curves tend rapidly to those corresponding to blackbody models . in brief , only for completely optically thick nebulae an excess of high energy photons will affect ( in a small amount ) the calculated zanstra temperatures .      some objects shown in figure 2b are outside the area covered by the models",
    ". these nebulae can be either above the area limited by the curves or below it .",
    "those above the curves limiting the high values of zr could be explained by an error in t@xmath1(he ii ) of the order of 5 - 10 @xmath30 .",
    "however , checking more carefully , it can be verified that most of these nebulae are abell nebulae , including ngc 246 , the prototype of the class ( abell 1966 ) . observations of the central star of some of these nebulae show characteristics of high stellar temperatures ; furthermore , the nebulae have low surface brightness and large angular diameter ( abell 1966 ) .",
    "these objects are probably in an advanced evolutionary stage .",
    "some of them are known to have very high nebular he abundance in their inner regions ( jacoby & ford 1983 ; guerrero & manchado 1996 ) .",
    "calculations for he - rich nebulae show that abundances up to he / h = 0.25 can explain the positions of the nebulae lying above the limiting curves in figure 2b . results for t@xmath0 = 150,000 k and he / h = 0.20 are shown in figure 3 by the dot - dashed line .",
    "note that for high optical depths the curves for the same stellar temperature but different he abundance are superposed . for t@xmath0 = 150,000 k ,",
    "the curves separate from each other when @xmath10 @xmath3 2.5 .",
    "the reason is that increasing the he abundance , the he@xmath9 zone decreases relative to the h@xmath2 zone by 36@xmath30 in volume for this value of t@xmath0 .",
    "thus , a decrease of the nebula optical depth will only affect the he@xmath9 zone [ and consequently t@xmath1(he ii ) ] when t@xmath1(h ) is very low .",
    "thus , the area covered by the models stretches toward higher zr , including the high zr objects .",
    "large nebulae have been studied in detail by kaler and collaborators ( kaler 1981 , 1983b ; kaler & feibelman 1985 ; kaler et al .",
    "1990 ) . for many of these nebulae the color temperature obtained from uv observations",
    "are well above their zanstra temperatures .",
    "this is consistent with our results ( fig .",
    "2b ) that show that the stellar temperature can be higher than t@xmath1(he ii ) . because of their large diameters , the density in the abell or other large nebulae may be smaller than the one assumed for the standard models",
    ". however , as mentioned above , results for the zanstra temperatures with different densities are similar .",
    "the above results do not necessarily mean that all the nebulae lying above the limiting curves are he - rich , or , inversely , that all he - rich nebulae have positions above the curves plotted in figure 2 .",
    "the same questions can be asked regarding the nebulae size . from the 19 nebulae above the curves ,",
    "14 have calculated or limiting values for the abundance ; from these , only one have he abundance definitively below the average value for planetary nebulae as given by kingsburgh & barlow ( 1994 ) .",
    "however , he - rich nebulae are also found in regions of higher optical depth in the diagrams . regarding the size , all nebulae above the curves , except two ( hu 1 - 2 , with 0.018 pc , and cn 1 - 2 , with no value calculated for the radius ) have radius larger than 0.15 pc ( cahn , kaler , & stanghellini 1992 ) .",
    "but large nebulae are spread everywhere in the diagrams . in brief ,",
    "large and/or he - rich nebulae can be found in any location on the diagram , but most of those above the limiting curves are large and he - rich .    as discussed below , a he - rich atmosphere may provide the explanation for the outsiders with very low zr .",
    "a high he abundance in the inner parts of a nebula can indicate a high he in the upper layers of the star , including their atmospheres .",
    "the energy spectrum of a he - rich atmosphere will show a deficit of high energy ( e @xmath4 54.4 ev ) photons because of the contribution of he to the stellar continuum opacity .",
    "henry & shipman ( 1986 ) discarded a high he abundance in the stellar atmosphere , since they do not explain the zanstra discrepancy shown by most pns ( zr @xmath4 1 ) , concluding that the atmospheres have subsolar he abundance ( and an excess of high - energy photons ) .",
    "our results show that the main effect originating the zanstra discrepancy is the optical effect .",
    "however , photoionization models assuming an ionizing spectrum with a deficit of photons with energy higher than 54.4 ev indicate that zr is less than unity in the optically thick case , lowering the limit defined by the models .",
    "results for models with various stellar temperatures and an ionizing spectrum showing a deficit of a factor of five in the flux of high - energy photons , relative to a blackbody , are shown by the dotted lines in figure 3 .",
    "the corresponding blackbody results are shown by the solid lines .",
    "thus , such ionizing spectrum , presenting a deficit of high - energy photons , may explain the outsiders with low zr .",
    "the results presented in figures 2 and 3 can be used to obtain the nebula optical depth as well as a value for the stellar temperature more accurately than that given by the zanstra temperatures . however , for optically thin nebulae , the curves are crowded up and the temperature is not well defined .",
    "the same occurs for high stellar temperatures , even at high optical depths .",
    "thus , another method for obtaining the stellar temperature is required .",
    "since the optical depth is a major factor of the stellar temperature determination , line intensity ratios produced by ions in different ionization stages can be used to distinguish nebulae with different optical depths . when plotted against t@xmath1(he ii ) , many of these line ratios also show a crowding of the curves corresponding to different models .",
    "the best ratio discriminating the results for different models is the ratio between he ii and he i line intensities . the results for he ii @xmath134686/he i @xmath135786 and he ii @xmath134686/he i @xmath134471 versus t@xmath1(he ii ) are presented in figures 4a and 4b , respectively , for the same models of figures 1 and 2 . notice that , for a given range of t@xmath0 and @xmath10 , particularly for low optical depths , the curves in figure 4 are more widely spaced and provide a better determination of these parameters than the curves shown in figure 2 .    regarding the nebulae in the crowded region of figure .",
    "2b , for which there is an uncertainty in the determination of t@xmath0 , the stellar temperature may be obtained from figure 4 . besides the 19 nebulae above the curves in figure 2b , 28 nebulae are in the region where the results for t@xmath0 are just lower limits .",
    "for all these nebulae , only 20 have measured intensities for he ii and he i lines . with intensities taken from the literature ( torres - peimbert & peimbert 1977 ; aller & czyzak 1979 , 1983 ; jacoby & ford 1983 ; kaler 1983a ; kaler 1985b ; manchado , mampaso & pottasch 1987 ; peimbert & torres - peimbert 1987 ; kaler et al .",
    "1990 ; acker et al . 1991",
    "; de freitas pacheco , maciel & costa 1992 ; stanghellini , kaler & shaw 1994 ; kingsburgh & barlow 1994 ) , the stellar temperatures obtained from figure 4 are higher than t@xmath1(he ii ) by about 10@xmath30 in general but can reach 32@xmath30 . for the selected nebulae , the",
    "maximum observed value for he ii @xmath134686/he i @xmath135786 is 1.85dex for ngc 4361 ( there is also a measured lower limit for its central region of 2.25dex ) . for he",
    "ii @xmath134686/he i @xmath134471 the maximum measured ratio is 2.37dex , for ngc 2022 .",
    "higher ratios , corresponding to lower optical depths , are not measured since he i is too faint to be detected .",
    "notice that for high t@xmath0 ( @xmath4 150,000 k ) , he i can be very faint even for @xmath10 higher than unity , since , as shown in figure 1 , the higher t@xmath0 the smaller the he@xmath2 region .",
    "so , for nebulae with low zr and no detected he i line , the stellar temperature can be much higher than t@xmath1(he ii ) .",
    "as long as the he ii zanstra temperature is known , this alternative method can be used and may be considered as a second - order approximation to the stellar temperature , providing values closer to the real stellar temperature , even for nebulae showing a high he ii / he i line ratio .",
    "one of the problems concerning the understanding of pns and their evolution is the determination of their stellar temperature .",
    "the zanstra method is generally used , although the h and he ii zanstra temperatures may be discrepant and may underestimate the stellar temperature .",
    "many authors suggested that the dominant mechanism explaining the zanstra discrepancy is the optical depth . because t@xmath1(he ii )",
    "is less affected by the nebula optical depth , these authors suggest adopting t@xmath1(he ii ) as the true stellar temperature . besides the importance of a good determination of the stellar temperature of planetary nebulae for the analysis of the emission - line spectrum and the chemical abundance determination of pns , let us recall that the position of the central star of pn on the h - r diagram is a crucial test of evolutionary models from the agb to the white dwarf stages .    here",
    "the nebula optical depth effect is analyzed in detail using photoionization models . from the theoretical h@xmath14",
    "and he ii @xmath134686 line intensities , the zanstra temperatures are calculated and compared to the adopted stellar temperatures for a variety of models with different optical depths .",
    "our results show that the nebula optical depth is the main factor explaining the behavior of the zanstra temperatures with the stellar temperature .",
    "the zanstra discrepancy mainly occurring for low stellar temperatures is clearly explained by the changes induced by the optical depth in the relative ionic distribution in the nebula ( figs . 1 and 2 ) .",
    "another consequence is that even the he ii zanstra temperature underestimates t@xmath0 , mainly for nebulae with high - temperature stars .",
    "the results showing that the stellar temperature can be higher than t@xmath1(he ii ) are consistent with uv data for the central stars of pns ( pottasch et al .",
    "1978 ; kaler & feibelman 1985 ) .",
    "the relation between the zanstra temperature ratio zr and t@xmath1(he ii ) ( fig .",
    "2 ) can be used to obtain a more accurate estimate of the stellar temperature . however , for nebulae with very high stellar temperature and/or small optical depths the theoretical results for different stellar temperatures and optical depths are crowded and the method is uncertain . for these nebulae , a better determination of these parameters can be obtained from a plot of he ii / he i versus t@xmath1(he ii ) ( figs .",
    "an important source of uncertainty is related to the kind of observations used to determine the stellar temperature .",
    "observed line intensities do not always refer to the whole nebula since line ratios are usually obtained from observations with a narrow slit crossing the nebula .",
    "furthermore , the nebula may be inhomogeneous and the optical depth anisotropic .",
    "that is , the nebula can be optically thick in some direction but optically thin in others .",
    "this is a very important point not addressed in this paper .",
    "line intensity ratios obtained with a narrow slit , or in a given position of a nebula , may not correspond to the ratio for the entire nebula ( gruenwald , viegas , & broguire 1997 ; gruenwald & viegas 1998 ) .",
    "cases of very high or very low zr can be explained by the coupled effect of optical depth and over- or under - abundance of he in the stellar atmosphere , which affects the ionizing spectrum .",
    "a nebular overabundance of he relative to solar values and a low optical thickness explain the very high discrepancy shown by some abell planetaries .",
    "on the other hand , zrs less than unity are characteristic of optically thick pns with undersolar he abundance .",
    "stanghellini et al .",
    "( 1993 ) state that since bipolar nebulae have t@xmath1(he ii ) @xmath5 t@xmath1(h ) , they are thicker than other nebulae . however , central stars of bipolar nebulae are known to have high temperatures ( corradi & schwarz 1995 ) . from our results ( figure 2 ) these nebulae are expected to have t@xmath1(he ii ) @xmath5   t@xmath1(h ) , even if they are not completely optically thick .",
    "finally , the `` zanstra wall '' in the log l - log t diagram ( shaw and kaler 1989 ) is related to the fact that the zanstra method underestimates the stellar temperature and this effect is larger for high - temperature stars .",
    "consequently , the lack of high - temperature stars ( predicted by the evolutionary models ) in the log l - log t diagram can be easily understood .",
