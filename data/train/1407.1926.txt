    "flute is a linac - based electron accelerator which is presently being built at the anka synchrotron radiation facility at the karlsruhe institute of technology .",
    "the acronym flute stands for the german expression _ ferninfrarot _ _ linac- und test - experiment _ translated to english as `` far - infrared linac- and test experiment . ''",
    "flute has a design energy of approximately where the baseline machine layout of the first phase is depicted in .    in the current design",
    "the electron source is a 2 1/2 cell photocathode radiofrequency ( rf ) gun with a maximum repetition rate of .",
    "electrons are released by shooting a pulsed ti : sa laser with a fundamental wavelength of on a copper cathode where its third frequency harmonic will be used .",
    "the released electrons are then accelerated to .",
    "the charge of the bunches produced by the gun is planned to range from to . upon leaving the gun",
    "the beam is transversally focused by a solenoid before entering the linac accelerating the electrons to the design energy of approximately . behind the linac",
    "the beam is focused again by a doublet of quadrupole magnets before it enters the bunch compressor consisting of four dipole magnets .",
    "one goal of flute is to produce coherent synchrotron radiation ( csr ) in the terahertz ( thz ) range . to achieve this",
    ", sub - picosecond bunch lengths will be necessary where the aim is to compress bunches to lengths in the femtosecond regime .",
    "for the past few years there has been a growing interest in coherent thz sources due to the various possibilities of using this kind of radiation both in research and in application .",
    "the following list does not claim to be complete but will give some representative examples .    * in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown theoretically that by applying an external oscillating electric field to a sample of graphene , it is possible to produce higher harmonic modes . at room temperature",
    "this effect may occur for frequencies in the thz regime .",
    "therefore it could open the way to graphene devices in thz electronics .",
    "* in a cuprate superconductor a special kind of soliton was excited successfully by using intense and narrow - band thz radiation @xcite .",
    "if the generation , acceleration , and stopping of such solitons is under control , these could be exploited for transporting and storing information in such composites . *",
    "the chemical composition @xmath0 is ferroelectric , i.e. , below some critical temperature it exhibits domains with a spontaneous electric dipole moment .",
    "these domains are separated by domain walls that can be manipulated by applying a strong , external electric field . in ref .",
    "@xcite the physical mechanisms occurring at microscopic scales are investigated and the results are compared with experimental data . if the microscopic mechanisms of moving domain walls are better understood , such ferroelectric materials could be the basis for ultra - fast computer memories .",
    "* by experiment it was shown that the magnetization direction of thin cobalt films can be reversed by short thz pulses , if the magnetization vector lies in the plane of the film @xcite .",
    "some ( but not all ) characteristics of the experimental results can be described by a simple model based on the landau  lifshitz equation",
    ". a better understanding of the physics and a further development of this method could lead to novel devices used for magnetic recording at high data rates .",
    "the dashed line is the trajectory of an electron bunch .",
    "such bunches are produced in a photocathode gun and accelerated by the linac to the design energy of .",
    "the rf of for the gun and the linac is delivered by a klystron .",
    "solenoids and quadrupole magnets are used to focus the beam in the transverse directions .",
    "we plan to place diagnostics at certain positions along the machine to extract information on the transverse and longitudinal beam dimensions .",
    "electron bunches are supposed to be compressed by a bunch compressor consisting of four rectangular dipole magnets . after compressing ,",
    "the bunches produce coherent thz radiation that is coupled out before the electrons hit the beam dump . ]",
    "the applications above have two characteristics in common : they need high electric and magnetic field strengths ( in the order of magnitude of mv / m and several hundred ka / m , respectively ) and they happen on ultra - short time scales ( picoseconds ) . these properties can be provided by pulses of coherent synchrotron radiation in the thz regime ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the first phase of flute the compression of the electron bunches",
    "shall be achieved with a magnetic bunch compressor .",
    "this compressor is a d - shape chicane consisting of four dipole magnets with each of them having the same magnetic field strength value .",
    "the directions of the field in the first and fourth dipole magnet are opposite to the directions in the second and third magnet .",
    "the distances between the first two and the last two magnets are supposed to be equal .",
    "since the electrons travel on curved trajectories inside this chicane they emit synchrotron radiation . if the bunch length is much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation , wave trains emitted from different electrons are in phase with respect to each other and they can interfere constructively .",
    "the radiation produced is then coherent and its intensity grows with the number of radiating electrons squared .",
    "hence , the flute chicane serves the purpose of compressing the bunches and is the place where the coherent radiation will be generated .",
    "due to space charge effects and the self - interaction of bunches with their own coherent radiation field a compression of bunches to a length of several femtoseconds is a challenging task .",
    "that is why a better understanding of the chicane is of paramount importance .",
    "therefore , the scope of the current article is to provide a framework for analytical bunch compression studies for flute .",
    "the analytical results will also be compared to results obtained with the simulation tool astra @xcite .",
    "in the current section analytical results on bunch compression in the flute chicane are obtained , where a draft of the latter is shown in . to make this approach feasible ,",
    "first of all the d - shape chicane is considered to consist of ideal dipole magnets . these are assumed to have a homogeneous magnetic field with flux density @xmath1 inside the poles which immediately drops to zero outside . in the first and fourth magnet",
    "the field is to point along the negative @xmath2-axis , whereas in the second and third magnet it points along the positive @xmath2-axis .     and",
    "@xmath2 ( orthogonal to the drawing plane ) correspond to the two transverse directions and the label @xmath3 corresponds to the longitudinal direction . the chicane is assumed to lie in the @xmath4-@xmath3-place and the @xmath3-axis points along the direction of the electron beam right before the chicane .",
    "the plain ( blue ) curve depicts one possible electron trajectory .",
    "the length of a single chicane magnet is denoted as @xmath5 .",
    "the distance between the first two and the last two magnets is called @xmath6 , whereas the distance between the second and the third magnet is denoted as @xmath7 .",
    "the angle @xmath8 is the bending angle of each magnet and @xmath9 is the bending radius . ]",
    "the bending radius in a chicane magnet is given by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the relativistic electron momentum with the lorentz factor @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the electron rest mass , @xmath14 the electron propagation velocity , and @xmath15 the speed of light . an electron has the charge @xmath16 with the elementary charge @xmath17 .",
    "the bending angle can be computed as @xmath18 .",
    "first of all , space charge effects and the back reaction of the bunch with its csr will be neglected . as a result , all considerations of the current chapter are of geometrical nature .",
    "the reduction of the bunch length within the chicane then essentially results from the path length difference of electrons with different momenta .",
    "the length of the trajectory of an electron traveling with momentum @xmath19 is given by : @xmath20 now the difference between the traveling lengths of two electrons is considered .",
    "the first electron is assumed to travel with the design ( reference ) momentum @xmath19 and the second electron with a momentum that deviates from @xmath19 by @xmath21 . for @xmath22",
    "a taylor expansion can be performed with respect to the dimensionless normalized momentum deviation @xmath23 . due to the limited extension of the beam pipe",
    ", the bending angle @xmath8 must be much smaller than @xmath24 .",
    "this translates to the necessary condition that @xmath25 .",
    "hence , it makes sense to perform a second expansion with respect to the small ratio @xmath26 .",
    "that leads to a transparent result for the path length difference : @xmath27\\delta + \\mathcal{o}\\left[\\delta^2,(l_{\\mathrm{mag}}/r)^4\\right]\\,.\\ ] ] it is evident that @xmath28 for @xmath29 .",
    "this is clear since the bending angle of an electron with a larger momentum is smaller resulting in a shorter path length traveled by the respective particle .",
    "we decided to perform the following calculations throughout the paper for the two extreme cases that were simulated with astra : a bunch with the high charge of and a bunch with the very low charge of .",
    "the longitudinal phase space distribution of electron bunches produced at flute , i.e. , their longitudinal momentum spread @xmath30 as a function of the longitudinal particle position @xmath31 respective the reference particle has certain characteristics directly after the linac .",
    "these are paramount for compression .",
    "in addition to a momentum spread based on statistical uncertainties , the longitudinal phase space shows a correlated momentum spread ( chirp ) .",
    "this means that the average momentum spread as a function of @xmath31 is not zero but depends on @xmath31 ( see for a typical simulated bunch and for a bunch before the chicane ) . in this paper",
    "the bunch length @xmath32 is computed as the root mean square ( rms ) of the @xmath31-values where @xmath33 is related to the @xmath34-th particle : @xmath35 ^ 2}\\,.\\ ] ] the sum runs over all particles , i.e. , @xmath36 is the number of particles in the bunch .",
    "the average particle position is denoted by @xmath37 . from this formula",
    "directly follows the relation @xmath38 meaning that the rms bunch length is given by the square root of the difference between the average of the squared particle positions and the squared average position .",
    "the rms momentum spread @xmath39 of a bunch is computed analogously .",
    "in fact , the greek letter @xmath40 will always indicate an rms quantity .    since the momentum spread is negative at the head of the bunch the corresponding particles travel with a lower velocity compared to the tail of the bunch where the momentum spread is positive .",
    "the distributions in were obtained by simulating electron bunches from their generation at the cathode to the linac exit with the help of astra .",
    "these are the bunches that we intend to use in the framework of the paper .",
    "note that the typical length scale of a @xmath41{nc}$ ] bunch directly before the flute chicane lies in the picosecond regime , whereas the length of the @xmath42{pc}$ ] bunch is several hundred femtoseconds .",
    "now the phase space coordinates of these bunches are tracked through the chicane analytically .",
    "to do so we need the parametric representation @xmath43 of the electron trajectory with respect to the path length @xmath44 traveled .",
    "it consists of four parts of a circle and three straight lines ( plus one line directly before and one directly after the chicane ) and it can be found in . via the bending radius @xmath9 and the bending angle @xmath8 it depends on the electron momentum @xmath19 .",
    "what serves as an input are the bunch phase space coordinates one meter before the chicane ( at @xmath45{m}$ ] ) that were obtained from a simulation of the bunch from the cathode to this position . every electron is then sent along its path through the chicane where @xmath46 gives the spatial coordinates for an electron with momentum @xmath47 after travelling a distance @xmath44 . at the position @xmath48{m}$ ] , which is one meter behind the bunch compressor ,",
    "the @xmath3-coordinate of the reference electron with momentum @xmath19 is subtracted from the @xmath3-coordinate of the electron with momentum @xmath47 .",
    "this gives the position @xmath49 of an electron with respect to the reference particle after the bunch compressor : @xmath50{m}+l(p+\\delta p),p+\\delta p)-z(\\unit[2]{m}+l(p),p)\\,.\\ ] ] herein , @xmath51 is the traveling length through the chicane , which is given by .",
    "hence , the bunch coordinates after the compressor are projected on the @xmath3-axis . with this method particle velocity differences",
    "are taken into account as well .",
    "due to such a velocity difference a particle at the tail of the bunch with larger momentum may further catch up to a particle at the head with lower momentum .",
    "this effect is called velocity bunching .",
    "an additional advantage of the technique described above is that the spatial particle coordinates can be obtained after travelling an arbitrary length @xmath44 inside the chicane .",
    "figure  [ fig : bunch - length - reduction ] shows how the bunch lengths for the and bunch evolve within the bunch compressor . from the range of all electrons within the bunches",
    "we pick two with the initial distances and , respectively ( see the captions of ) .",
    "it is evident that the bunch length is mainly reduced in the regions between the first two and the last two magnets .",
    "hence , a large difference in traveling lengths is achieved with a large bending angle and a big @xmath6 . the drift length between the second and the third magnet leads to a tiny reduction only originating from the velocity difference between the electrons .",
    "because of this , @xmath7 mainly decouples from the bunch length reduction , which can also be seen from .    the rate , which the reduction of the bunch length takes place with , increases in the first magnet until it reaches a constant value when the bunch enters the drift between the first two magnets . in the second magnet the rate decreases by the same amount as it had increased in the first magnet .",
    "the same pattern repeats in the last two magnets because of the symmetry of the chicane and due to the neglect of space charge forces and csr effects , which may become important for bunch lengths in the femtosecond regime .",
    "comparing to the astra output of figure 6 in @xcite ( where space charge effects are taken into account ) reveals that compression is suppressed in the last two bending magnets because of the increasing space charge effects in the compressed bunch . due to the neglect of space charge effects in the time evolutions for both bunch charges",
    "look the same .",
    "after all , the resulting curve then scales only with the initial distance between the two electrons .",
    "the overall bunch compression sensitively depends on the final rate of compression at the end of the first and third magnet , respectively .",
    "if this rate is high it will stay high during the propagation of the bunch between the first two or the last two magnets heavily reducing the bunch length .",
    "so these drift spaces play a major role for compression .",
    "note that the bunch length is decreased by a minor fraction in the drift lengths before , in the middle , and after the chicane as a result of velocity bunching .",
    "since these effects are rather small for a particle energy in the @xmath52{mev}$ ] range , @xmath7 does not play that much a role for compression at flute .",
    "this space can be used rather for beam diagnostics , e.g. , a skew quadrupole , which can give information on the longitudinal bunch profile when combined with a fluorescent screen placed downstream the chicane ( see ) .",
    "besides , the final distances between the two electrons considered are negative for both bunches indicating an overcompression .",
    "however note that considering two electrons with the distance @xmath32 is not equivalent to considering a bunch of many electrons with the bunch length @xmath32 .",
    "hence an overcompression does then not necessarily occur for the bunch as a whole , which can be seen in the subsequent results .",
    "one can say that a minimum distance between two electrons and a minimum bunch length @xmath32 are different optimization criteria .",
    "+    now we are interested in the longitudinal phase space after the chicane for the and the bunches used previously .",
    "sending each electron along its own trajectory leads to the results shown in .",
    "note that the units used for the horizontal axis are now femtoseconds .",
    "the rms bunch length was reduced by a factor of 10.9 for the bunch and a factor of 34.9 for the bunch .",
    "the double - s structure visible in results from the superimposed bumps in the initial distribution shown in .",
    "since all particle positions are reduced by compression this structure is now more evident than it had been in the latter figure .",
    "we see that both the final bunch lengths and the bunch profiles of the analytical calculation in figs .",
    "[ fig : bunch - after - chicane - analytical-3nc ] , [ fig : bunch - after - chicane - analytical-1pc ] agree well with the astra simulation results in figs .",
    "[ fig : bunch - after - chicane - astra-3nc ] , [ fig : bunch - after - chicane - astra-1pc ] . for the bunch",
    "there is a deviation of the final bunch length of approximately 5% and for the bunch it is only 3% .",
    "bunch distributions that are obtained from astra simulations starting at the cathode usually are contaminated by substructures .",
    "these were mentioned at the end of the previous section .",
    "hence , for a theoretical understanding of the compression scheme it is more convenient to use an ideal longitudinal phase space distribution .",
    "an ideal correlated energy spread is described by a straight line connecting the coordinates @xmath53 of the head particle and @xmath54 the tail particle of the bunch . for simplicity",
    "the coordinate @xmath55 of the reference particle shall lie in the center of the bunch .",
    "for the longitudinal phase space these are then given by :    @xmath56    where @xmath32 the rms bunch length , and @xmath39 the rms ( correlated ) momentum spread .",
    "an ideal chirp may then be parameterized by the following straight line : @xmath57\\,.\\ ] ] the chicane transforms the chirp of the bunch . at linear order in the momentum",
    "spread this transformation can be written in matrix notation such that a matrix @xmath9 acts on an initial longitudinal phase space vector @xmath58 producing the final vector @xmath59 : @xmath60 herein @xmath61 and @xmath49 are the longitudinal distances of a bunch particle before and after compression , respectively .",
    "the matrix element @xmath62 relates the longitudinal distance to the normalized momentum spread .",
    "note that in some papers instead of @xmath31 the path length difference @xmath63 respective a reference particle is used directly .",
    "now consider , for instance , the head particle of the bunch .",
    "if @xmath64 , the head particle has traveled a larger distance through the chicane compared to the reference particle .",
    "then the distance with respect to the reference particle reduces by this amount , i.e. , @xmath65 . from",
    "it follows that @xmath66 .",
    "then @xmath62 can be directly extracted from : @xmath67 in light of the previous arguments we have @xmath68 .",
    "is defined to be negative ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the reason is that these authors either use the path length difference @xmath63 instead of @xmath31 in the phase space vector or they define @xmath69 .",
    "none of these procedures will be followed in the current paper . ]",
    "the parameter @xmath62 is also called momentum compaction factor and it contains the main information on bunch compression . the notation used will be explained at a later point within this article . as the momentum spread is not transformed by the chicane , the matrix element at the lower left corner of the matrix @xmath9 vanishes .",
    "this is clear since the bunch compressor solely consists of magnetic fields . in the literature",
    "the following expression for @xmath62 for such a d - shape chicane is used as well ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath70 the latter result is exact and valid for arbitrarily large bending angles @xmath8 . by a taylor expansion with respect to @xmath26",
    "it can be proven that @xmath71 for @xmath25 besides corrections suppressed by @xmath72 .",
    "shows how an ideal chirp is transformed by the chicane .",
    "both panels contain the initial chirp ( blue ) and the final one ( red ) . here",
    "the longitudinal distance was normalized by the rms bunch length , i.e. , it ranges from -1 to 1 .",
    "the left panel shows the result of the transformation given by .",
    "since the transformation is linear the straight line is transformed to a straight line where the bunch length , i.e. , the distance between the head and the tail particle decreases . in case the final chirp is aligned along the vertical axis , the compression is optimal .",
    "this can be characterized by the angle @xmath73 between the initial and the final chirp that can be computed as @xmath74 best compression results for @xmath75 where the associated angle will be denoted as @xmath76 . for the bunch",
    "we obtain @xmath77{nc}}\\approx 2.07^{\\circ}\\,,\\quad \\theta_b|_{\\unit[3]{nc } } \\approx 2.11^{\\circ}\\,,\\quad ( \\theta/\\theta_b)|_{\\unit[3]{nc } } \\approx 0.98\\,,\\ ] ] and for the bunch we compute @xmath78{pc}}\\approx 1.61^{\\circ}\\,,\\quad \\theta_b|_{\\unit[1]{pc } } \\approx 1.62^{\\circ}\\,,\\quad ( \\theta/\\theta_b)|_{\\unit[1]{pc } } \\approx 0.99\\,.\\ ] ] hence , the chicane parameters have evidently been chosen such that the angle @xmath73 lies in the vicinity of the optimum for both bunch charges .",
    "this is even better for the bunch , since its initial chirp is closer to an ideal one  in contrast to the bunch having substructures ( see ) .",
    "the procedure proposed provides a good method of giving a first estimate on the optimum parameters of the bunch compressor .",
    "the right panel of shows the result of the transformation when the full particle trajectory is taken into account as described in .",
    "since this method also includes higher order terms in @xmath30 , the transformation of the chirp is no longer linear .",
    "then the resulting chirp is not a straight line any more but it has a curvature .",
    "based on the transformation given by every point of the chirp is transformed with the same matrix element @xmath62 .",
    "however this does not hold in general , but @xmath79\\,,\\ ] ] where the function @xmath80 involves the phase space vector @xmath81 in a nonlinear way .",
    "so by talking about nonlinearities in this context we mean that an initial ideal chirp being a straight line is not transformed into a straight line any more .",
    "this is the case when the transformation contains higher - order polynomials in @xmath82 .",
    "such a situation can not be described by a matrix multiplication according to .      in the previous considerations",
    "the incoming electron was assumed to only have a longitudinal momentum component .",
    "the resulting chicane trajectory was shown in .",
    "however electrons entering the chicane are expected to have transverse momentum components as well , which lie in the mrad regime for flute .",
    "the transverse momentum components @xmath83 and @xmath84 can be described by two angles @xmath85 and @xmath86 with respect to the @xmath3-axis : @xmath87 in case of nonvanishing angles @xmath85 and @xmath86 the trajectory of the electron through the chicane will be modified .",
    "the parametric representation of the resulting particle trajectory was derived and is given in .",
    "a draft for such a modified trajectory restricted to the @xmath4-@xmath3-plane is shown in , where the unmodified trajectory is drawn as well .",
    "what becomes evident at first is that after the chicane the electron does not turn back to the path it would have traveled without the chicane .",
    "hence there is an offset transverse distance @xmath88 .",
    "the strong deviation off - axis is caused within the distance @xmath6 between the first two magnets , where the electron exits the first magnet under an additional angle .",
    "this leads to a long drift in @xmath4-direction before the electron reaches the second magnet and this propagation is not compensated in the last two magnets .",
    "furthermore , in practice the magnetic field strength values in the chicane magnets can not be assumed to agree all the time .",
    "as every power supply has a current jitter @xmath89 this will result in a jitter @xmath90 of the magnetic flux density : @xmath91 the electron trajectory is modified by such a field jitter and a possible resulting curve is presented in . here",
    "each dipole magnet has a different bending radius , which applies when the magnet power supplies are operated in parallel .",
    "first of all the magnetic field values in all four dipole magnets are assumed to be constant .",
    "we investigate the influence on the bunch length by initial transverse angles @xmath85 with respect to the @xmath3-axis and initial transverse position deviations @xmath92 .",
    "the modified bunch length is obtained for 100 configurations .",
    "talking about a `` configuration '' we mean that the angle @xmath85 is chosen randomly to lie in the interval @xmath93{rad},\\unit[10^{-2}]{rad}]$ ] for each particle .",
    "furthermore , at the same time this is done for the initial transverse deviation @xmath92 that is chosen within the range @xmath93{m},\\unit[10^{-2}]{m}]$ ] .",
    "the probability distributions are taken as uniform for both intervals .",
    "note that these intervals are hypothetical since realistic values are much smaller ; this will be discussed below .",
    "the result is shown in .    as a second step",
    "a magnetic field jitter was considered without any transverse momentum components or offsets .",
    "the modified bunch length due to this jitter can be computed and normalized by the final bunch length that is obtained without any jitter .",
    "this was done for 100 configurations . in that case",
    "a `` configuration '' means that the flux density is chosen independently for each magnet within the interval @xmath94 $ ] , based on a uniform probability distribution .",
    "the result for @xmath95 is presented in .",
    "indicates that the maximum modification of the bunch length due to transverse angles in the @xmath42{mrad}$ ] regime and transverse offsets in the @xmath96{m}$ ] range lies even below one per mill .",
    "realistic transverse deviations are much smaller . for a typical bunch ,",
    "@xmath92 is in the order of @xmath97{m}$ ] and @xmath85 in the order of @xmath98{mrad}$ ] .",
    "hence , the transverse electron coordinates do not seem to have a large influence on bunch compression  at least within this simplified analysis .",
    "besides , it can be shown that for angles @xmath99{rad}$ ] the bunch length increases to a larger degree in comparison to the smaller angles considered before . this may indicate that the transverse offset @xmath88 behind the chicane starts playing a larger role for these values .",
    "however such rather large angles are purely hypothetical and do not appear in typical bunches at flute .",
    "reveals that the bunch length can be modified by a factor of @xmath100 due to a jitter of the magnetic flux density of @xmath95 .",
    "so the uncertainty in the stability of the flux density is directly imposed on the bunch length without becoming larger or smaller .",
    "the conclusion is that there is a linear connection between this uncertainty and the bunch length .",
    "otherwise we would expect a heavily larger or a smaller modification .",
    "it is planned to construct the flute bunch compressor using rectangular dipole magnets .",
    "however for theoretical reasons , in this paper we additionally intend to consider the characteristics of a bunch compressor made up of sector dipole magnets .",
    "a sector dipole is characterized by the property that the reference particle both enters and exits the magnet perpendicularly to its edges .",
    "this is not necessarily the case for a rectangular magnet .",
    "the principle of a chicane constructed with sector dipole magnets is shown in .",
    "the free parameters of such a chicane are the bending angle @xmath8 , the bending radius @xmath9 , and the distances @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we can then derive a parametric representation of the reference trajectory .",
    "the result can be found in . using this representation we compute the path length difference of two trajectories with normalized momentum spread @xmath101 . at first order in @xmath82 and for bending angles @xmath102",
    "we obtain : @xmath103 if the chicane parameters @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath6 are chosen such that they correspond to the parameters of the chicane in , the momentum compaction factor for @xmath104 and @xmath102 is the same for both types of chicanes .",
    "however , note that effects from the fringes of the dipole magnets have been neglected in this derivation .",
    "we will come back to the sector chicane at a later stage of the paper .     and the bending radius is denoted as @xmath9 .",
    "the distance between the exit face of the first / third dipole magnet and the entrance face of the second / fourth dipole magnet that is projected on the longitudinal axis is called @xmath6 .",
    "the distance between the second and the third magnet is @xmath7 . ]",
    "in the previous chapters the flute bunch compressor was investigated analytically by deriving parametric representations for particle trajectories in the compressor .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that all geometrical effects are taken into account .",
    "however this technique also has a number of disadvantages .",
    "first of all , the dipole field strength of the chicane magnets has been assumed to fall off to zero directly outside the magnet , i.e. , we have used a hard - edge model .",
    "this is not the case for real magnets having a nonzero fringe field outside of the iron yoke .",
    "secondly , the calculational time of this method is rather large since the trajectory for each electron has to be computed separately .",
    "this may already take several minutes for 5000 particles , which is the typical number of particles that we use .    for these reasons we are interested in considering an alternative approach in the current section .",
    "in general , each electron within a bunch can be described by a six - dimensional phase space vector @xmath105 , which reads as follows : @xmath106 these components give positions in configuration space and momentum space with respect to a reference particle .",
    "the variables @xmath92 and @xmath107 are the two transverse offsets , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the transverse angles , @xmath31 is the longitudinal distance , and @xmath101 the normalized momentum spread . for typical angles in the mrad - regime",
    "it holds that @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "this makes the description of the particle phase space by the first vector in equivalent to the description by the second vector .",

    "the total radiated power integrated over the whole frequency range is denoted by @xmath398 and @xmath399 is the critical frequency of synchrotron radiation .",
    "all physical constants are put in the prefactor of the spectrum in .",
    "the characteristic function @xmath400 for synchrotron radiation is dimensionless and depends on the dimensionless ratio @xmath401 .",
    "the integrand of @xmath400 is the modified bessel s function @xmath402 .",
    "a plot of the characteristic function is shown in .",
    "it has a maximum at the numerical value @xmath403 and it is characterized by the following further properties : @xmath404     of the synchrotron radiation spectrum as defined in shown in a double - logarithmic plot .",
    "the function is normalized by its maximum value .",
    "the area under the curve is divided by two at @xmath405 . ]",
    "the first of these results means that the total radiated power per unit frequency range is indeed given by @xmath406 .",
    "the second result shows that half of the power emitted is radiated by photons up to the critical frequency @xmath399 .",
    "a plot of the function @xmath400 is shown in .",

    "finally , the spectral photon flux giving the number of photons radiated per unit time and relative bandwidth is then given by : @xmath412 with @xmath413 where @xmath414 is planck s constant .",
    "when the length of a particle bunch lies in the order of magnitude ( or below ) of the radiation wavelength then synchrotron radiation can be emitted such that wave trains originating of different particles are in phase with each other ( see ) . then different wave trains can interfere constructively leading to a vast increase of the radiation intensity .",
    "such kind of radiation is called temporarily coherent or just coherent @xcite .",
    "the power spectrum of coherent synchrotron radiation emitted from a bunch can be obtained from the following equation @xcite : @xmath415 where @xmath416 is the number of radiating electrons , @xmath417 is the single particle synchrotron radiation power spectrum , and @xmath418 is known as form factor of the bunch .",
    "the form factor is the fourier transform of the particle density distribution @xmath419 describing the bunch @xcite : @xmath420 where @xmath274 is the unit vector pointing along the wave vector : @xmath421 with @xmath422 and the frequency @xmath423 of the wave .",
    "the form factor describes what wave numbers ( i.e. frequencies or wavelengths ) contribute to the coherent synchrotron radiation spectrum .",
    "the coherent radiation spectrum given by has certain interesting peculiarities .",
    "first of all , it grows quadratically with the number of particles .",
    "this is due to the fact that amplitudes add up constructively whereby the amplitude linearly depends on the particle number .",
    "the power then results from the amplitude squared .    secondly , since the bunch length is the only physical length scale in the form factor , its inverse appears in the spectrum .",
    "the power spectrum will significantly drop off for radiation wavelengths much smaller than the bunch length .",
    "thirdly , how fast this drop off takes place depends closely on the form factor of the bunch .",
    "this means that not only the bunch length is crucial for the coherent synchrotron radiation spectrum but also the longitudinal particle distribution .      in csrtrack simulations of the flute chicane",
    "it was found that 1d and 3d simulations produce different results for the phase space distribution after compression  as long as the energy is low enough or the beam current high enough @xcite .",
    "this especially was the case for the intended beam energy of approximately . in the framework of a 1d simulation",
    "the particle coordinates are projected on the longitudinal axis .",
    "this procedure is not followed in the 3d calculation where the all coordinates are taken into account .",
    "the 1d and 3d calculations produce similar results before the bunches enter the final chicane magnet .",
    "therefore the main differences between the 1d and the 3d calculation must have the origin at the fourth magnet . in this magnet",
    "the longitudinal bunch length becomes small enough such that the bunch produces a significant amount of coherent synchrotron radiation and experiences space charge effects .",
    "this observation lead the authors to the conclusion that the difference in 1d and 3d simulations for the flute chicane is a measure for space charge and csr effects .",
    "this is also due to the fact that the neglect of transverse coordinates do not properly take these effects into account .    besides ,",
    "in @xcite it was also observed that for a hypothetical beam energy of there was almost no difference between the phase space distribution after compression obtained from 1d and 3d simulations .",
    "based upon the previous conclusion one can infer that for such high energies both csr and space charge effects to not play that much of a role any more .",
    "for the space charge effects this behavior is easy to understand since according to @xcite they are suppressed by @xmath323 where @xmath220 is the lorentz factor ( see also ) .",
    "however according to the total power of synchrotron radiation grows proportional to @xmath424 .",
    "this originates from the behavior of the critical frequency @xmath399 which grows like @xmath425 and for large lorentz factor shifts the maximum of the synchrotron radiation spectrum to high frequencies .",
    "however the behavior of the csr spectrum with respect to the energy of the radiating particles is quite different .",
    "note that contrary to the normal synchrotron radiation spectrum , the csr spectrum involves the form factor , i.e. , the longitudinal shape of the bunch ( see ) .",
    "due to the form factor the radiated power spectrum drops off at frequencies larger than the bunch frequency @xmath426 .",
    "how fast this drop - off takes place , depends on the detail of the bunch shape .",
    "it occurs exponentially for a gaussian shape and only polynomially for a profile with a sharp edge @xcite .",
    "for simplicity we would like to assume that the maximum frequency of the csr spectrum equals @xmath427 and that all frequencies @xmath428 do not contribute to the radiated power .    to obtain the total radiated power , the spectrum should be integrated to the upper limit @xmath429 and not to infinitely high frequencies : @xmath430 in we obtain the value of this integral for @xmath431 .",
    "its result is given by @xmath432{2}\\pi}\\gamma\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\omega_b}{\\omega_c}\\right)^{4/3}+\\mathcal{o}\\left(\\frac{\\omega_b}{\\omega_c}\\right)^2\\,.\\ ] ] the frequency @xmath427 does not increase with the particle energy but depends only on the longitudinal bunch length . since the critical frequency @xmath399 grows with @xmath425 , for high energies @xmath433 is guaranteed .",
    "the total power @xmath398 grows with @xmath424 and this dependence is then cancelled by a factor @xmath434 coming from @xmath435 : @xmath436 this shows that the csr power is independent from the particle energy at leading order and when @xmath431 holds .",
    "since the particle momentum is given by @xmath437 , i.e. , it grows linearly with the lorentz factor the back reaction of csr on the bunch can be assumed to decrease for high energies .",
    "the bunch becomes more stable with respect to perturbations whereas the radiated energy stays the same .",
    "this is exactly the behavior that was observed with the tool csrtrack in @xcite .      in several papers",
    "it was noted that the synchrotron radiation spectrum for an electron moving through a dipole magnet once is different from the radiation spectrum that emerges when an electron performs many revolutions inside a magnet @xcite .",
    "the latter is what was calculated in @xcite and what is usually referred to as synchrotron radiation spectrum . since at flute",
    "we intend to generate csr in the last bending magnet of the chicane but not via an electron performing many revolutions inside a circular accelerator this statement deserves a further study .",
    "equation ( 16 ) in @xcite gives the relativistic , angle - integrated spectrum for frequencies @xmath408 .",
    "it is calculated as an expansion in @xmath438 where @xmath439 is the cyclotron frequency .",
    "the result involves functions @xmath440 and @xmath441 depending on @xmath156 and the bending angle @xmath8 of the radiating particle inside the magnet .",
    "the function @xmath442 gives the contribution at zeroth order in @xmath443 and @xmath444 delivers a contribution at first order in @xmath443 . according to @xcite",
    "there is a criterion upon which can be decided whether or not the radiation spectrum at small frequencies deviates from the standard synchrotron power spectrum .",
    "the equation @xmath445 defines a function @xmath446 , whose plot has been reproduced in .    , which is referred to in the text , as a function of @xmath156 .",
    "the minimal value of @xmath447 ( in the leftmost position ) lies at approximately @xmath448 and @xmath447 steadily increases to about @xmath449 . ]",
    "as long as the bending angle for a certain @xmath450 is larger than @xmath447 , the synchrotron radiation spectrum can be assumed to coincide with also for @xmath451 .",
    "however this is not the case if the bending angle is smaller than @xmath447 . for a particle energy of one",
    "obtains a limiting bending angle of @xmath452 .",
    "since in the flute chicane we have bending angles ranging from @xmath453 to @xmath454 ( for bunch charges of to , see @xcite ) we can expect the synchrotron radiation spectrum to be modified for small frequencies",
    ". however this change is supposed to occur for @xmath455 , where @xmath456{hz}$ ] .. ] this lies several orders of magnitude below the thz radiation regime , which we are interested in at flute . hence using the model above , the changes that are expected to occur for the synchrotron radiation spectrum when",
    "an electron moves through a bending magnet only once , can be safely neglected at flute .",
    "to summarize , analytical studies for bunch compression at the future linear accelerator flute were performed whose results were compared to the simulation output of the tools astra and csrtrack .",
    "the calculations were done for two typical bunches with the extremal charges of and that had been simulated from the cathode to the entrance of the bunch compressor . neglecting both space charge and csr effects ,",
    "the final bunch profiles obtained from mere path length differences agree very well with the simulation results . as a cross check ,",
    "the problem was then treated within the transfer matrix formalism as well .",
    "first order perturbation theory in the momentum spread gives a result for the final bunch length that deviates from the simulation results by several percent .",
    "for this reason considering second order terms is mandatory to give a good agreement .",
    "besides , in this context we obtained some second order coefficients for dipole magnets , fringe fields , and drifts .    to consider space charge effects , a simple model was introduced where the bunch is described by a homogeneously charged cylinder .",
    "the latter generates electric and also magnetic fields when moving .",
    "the equations of motion for a single electron at the surface of the cylinder were obtained and solved numerically . within this model ,",
    "the space charge effects are overestimated for a bunch charge of , whereas for there is a reasonable agreement with the simulations .",
    "it can be deduced that space charge effects are negligible for bunch compression at flute . in a future analysis",
    "the space charge effects could be considered with the help of the more complicated vlasov equation what was done in , e.g. , @xcite .    concerning the backreation of bunches with their own csr",
    "it was proven that the radiated csr power does not scale with the lorentz factor of the bunch but it stays constant .",
    "hence , for high energies a bunch is not sensitive to csr effects any more , which agrees with recent csrtrack simulations referred to in the current article .",
    "a next step could be to compute the energy loss of a typical bunch at flute analytically according to @xcite and to compare with the simulation results .",
    "another issue is that the synchrotron radiation spectrum is different for electrons moving through a bending magnet only once in comparison to circulating electrons .",
    "we were able to demonstrate that the spectral differences occur for frequencies that lie several orders of magnitude below the thz range , whereby this effect does not play any role for flute .",
    "the paper demonstrates how powerful the combination of analytical methods and simulations is to investigate bunch compression .",
    "the techniques presented shall provide a framework for further analytical compression studies .",
    "these can be used for future investigations of flute or they may be modified accordingly for other purposes .",

    "<S> the current article deals with analytical bunch compression studies for flute whose results are compared to simulations . </S>",
    "<S> flute is a linac - based electron accelerator with a design energy of approximately currently being constructed at the karlsruhe institute of technology . </S>",
    "<S> one of the goals of flute is to generate electron bunches with their length lying in the femtosecond regime . in the first phase </S>",
    "<S> this will be accomplished using a magnetic bunch compressor . </S>",
    "<S> this compressor forms the subject of the studies presented . </S>",
    "<S> the paper is divided into three parts . </S>",
    "<S> the first part deals with pure geometric investigations of the bunch compressor where space charge effects and the back reaction of bunches with coherent synchrotron radiation ( csr ) are neglected . the second part is dedicated to the treatment of space charge effects and the third part gives some analytical results on the emission of csr . </S>",
    "<S> the upshot is that the results of the first and the third part agree quite well with what is obtained from simulations . </S>",
    "<S> however , the space charge forces in the analytical model of the second part have the trend to be overestimated for large bunch charges . with this paper </S>",
