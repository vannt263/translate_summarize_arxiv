    "the dynamics of statistical systems quenched from high temperature disordered states to low temperature ordered states has been a subject of interest for several decades @xcite . in typical situations ,",
    "the average length scale @xmath1 of the ordered domain grows in time as a power law @xmath6 , where the growth exponent @xmath7 depends on the dimension of the space and that of the relevant order parameters , in addition to the conserved or non - conserved nature of the latter in the relaxation dynamics @xcite .",
    "usually characteristic topological defects such as vortices or domain walls are generated in the initial disordered state , and the annihilation of these defects provides the main mechanism of coarsening and phase ordering in the system .",
    "the observed self - similarity of these coarsening systems at different time instants , is usually represented by the so - called _ dynamic scaling hypothesis _ of the equal - time spatial correlation function of the order parameter .",
    "dynamic scaling hypothesis has been an important ingredient in deriving the properties of phase ordering in the late time stage .",
    "for example , in combination with the so called energy scaling method @xcite , domain growth laws could be extracted for almost all model systems with purely dissipative dynamics .",
    "previous works on phase ordering focused mostly on the cases where the effect of dissipation dominates the coarsening and the motion of the topological defects . on the other hand , in reality , there exist various interesting systems exhibiting dynamic processes that can not be described solely by dissipative dynamics .",
    "one example can be found in the case of magnetic spin systems , where the spins are influenced by neighboring spins via precession interaction terms that are energy conserving @xcite .",
    "these elements in the dynamics are called reversible ( non - dissipative ) mode coupling .",
    "in fact , among the various model systems ( model @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) classified by hohenberg and halperin@xcite that are known to describe the dynamic critical phenomena , only models @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are based on dissipative dynamics alone , with the remaining models @xmath11 ,",
    "@xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 retaining reversible mode couplings .",
    "hence , it is quite natural to extend studies on the phase ordering dynamics to these model systems .",
    "indeed some works have been carried out along this direction .",
    "a most familiar example is the phase separation dynamics of a binary fluid , in which reversible coupling between the hydrodynamic flow and the relative concentration , advection of the order parameter field by the fluid flow , plays an important role @xcite .",
    "effects of hydrodynamic flow on the phase ordering kinetics and defect dynamics of nematic liquid crystals have been studied @xcite .",
    "influence of precession on the phase ordering of an isotropic heisenberg magnet in three dimensions ( the model j @xcite ) has also been studied @xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting example is the phase ordering kinetics of the bose gas , i.e. , time evolution of the bose - einstein condensation , which was studied via the gross - pitaevski ( gp ) equation in two and three dimensions , demonstrating the importance of the reversible josephson precession term in the dynamics @xcite .",
    "alternative approach to this problem is to use the appropriate stochastic model known as the model @xmath12 @xcite in which the complex order parameter field @xmath16 is ( both statically and dynamically ) coupled to the conserved real field @xmath17 .    in this work",
    ", we investigate the phase ordering process of systems governed by a simpler model , namely , the model e @xcite in which there is no static coupling between @xmath16 and @xmath18 . specifically , we focus our investigation on the effect of the reversible spin precession term on the phase ordering process in the soft spin @xmath0 models in two dimensions .",
    "we especially try to compare the characteristics of the phase ordering dynamics of these model systems with those in the case where dissipative dynamics alone is considered .",
    "the linearized hard spin version of this model was employed by nelson and fisher @xcite to describe the behavior of the spin wave in the two - dimensional anisotropic ferromagnet and the hydrodynamics of the third sound propagation in thin film of @xmath19 . in @xcite ,",
    "the same set of linearized equations was used to demonstrate the crucial role played by the non - dissipative precession term in the phase ordering process of the defect free case in the two dimensional xy model .    in terms of phase ordering dynamics , @xmath0 models in two dimensions are of particular interest because the aforementioned energy scaling method do _ not _ provide a definitive result on the domain growth law . in equilibrium , the two dimensional ferromagnetic _",
    "xy _ model exhibits a berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition at @xmath20 due to the unbinding of vortex - antivortex pairs @xcite .",
    "below @xmath20 , the system has a quasi - ordered phase which is characterized by an algebraic decay of the order parameter correlation function for long distances . the critical exponent governing this power law decay decreases _ continuously _ down to zero temperature .",
    "that is , the system is critical at equilibrium for all non - vanishing temperatures below @xmath20 . therefore , the coarsening dynamics in this model at finite temperatures is expected to exhibit _ critical _ dynamic scaling instead of simple dynamic scaling .    large number of works using the purely dissipative dynamics have been carried out on the coarsening dynamics of the two dimensional xy / o(2 ) models @xcite .",
    "after all these efforts , it is now agreed that , in the phase ordering dynamics of ordinary _ @xmath0 _ models in two dimensions without mode coupling terms and with non - conserved order parameter , the growing length scale exhibits a logarithmic correction to the diffusive growth as @xmath21 . here",
    ", the logarithmic correction can be attributed to a logarithmic divergence ( with the system size ) of the effective friction constant ( or , inverse mobility ) of a moving vortex in the dissipative dynamics with non - conserved order parameter @xcite .    in a related simulation work @xcite on the coarsening dynamics of superconducting josephson junction arrays based on the dynamics of resistively - shunted junction model @xcite",
    ", it was revealed that there is _ no _ logarithmic correction in the growth law , resulting in purely diffusive growth law .",
    "this absence of logarithmic correction was understood in terms of finiteness of the effective friction constant ( or inverse mobility ) of a moving vortex in the limit of large system size , which is due to the particular type of dissipative coupling in josephson junction arrays@xcite .",
    "in addition , the coarsening dynamics of the two dimensional xy model with a purely hamiltonian dynamics @xcite exhibited the growing length scale with an apparent late - time power - law growth as @xmath22 with the exponent @xmath7 _ larger _ than the diffusive exponent @xmath23 .",
    "this kind of ( dynamics - dependent ) non - universal growth law motivated us to investigate further the phase ordering dynamics in related model systems .    actually , in the model e , we find that the growing length scale @xmath1 exhibits an apparent super - diffusive growth as @xmath22 with the `` effective '' dynamic exponent @xmath7 a little larger than the diffusive exponent @xmath23 . this can be contrasted to the case when reversible mode couplings are absent where the apparent growth exponents with values a little smaller than @xmath23 are obtained due to the ( negative ) logarithmic corrections mentioned above .",
    "the apparent super - diffusive exponent in the case of reversible mode coupling may suggest that the asymptotic behavior can be represented as a diffusive growth with a positive logarithmic corrections of the form @xmath24 , as discussed in detail below .",
    "one can extract another growing length scale from the excess energy relaxation .",
    "it is expected that the so - called energy scaling method @xcite can be applied to the present case as well since the reversible contribution does not dissipate energy .",
    "this method gives the relation @xmath25 ( between the excess energy @xmath26 versus a growing length @xmath27 ) .",
    "we find that the length scale @xmath27 derived from the above relation agrees with the growing length scale of the domains @xmath1 in almost the entire time .    in order to understand the characteristics of the length scale growth in the present system",
    ", we noted that the coarsening and the resultant growth of the length scale are determined by the annihilation of vortex - antivortex pairs .",
    "therefore , it is plausible to assume that the time @xmath28 that it takes for the system to grow up to a length scale @xmath1 will correspond to the time that it takes for vortex - antivortex pairs of separation @xmath1 to annihilate .",
    "based on this picture , we devised a simple phenomenological model of dynamics for the annihilation of a vortex - antivortex pair where we incorporate the effect of vortex inertia and logarithmically divergent mobility of the vortex @xcite .",
    "we found that this model can describe closely the simulation results .",
    "we argue that the microscopic mechanism of these coarsening features including the growth law , is closely related to the fact that there exists one conserved quantity in this model .",
    "that is , the @xmath17 field component ( see the next section ) , which is conjugate to the planar spin , is conserved .",
    "this corresponds to the third ( @xmath29- ) component of the spin in heisenberg spin systems with easy plane anisotropy @xcite . due to the conservation of this component",
    ", there appear _ propagating _ spin wave modes at low temperatures below @xmath30 where the vortices and antivortices are neglected . in the case of coarsening dynamics",
    "where there exist a lot of vortices and antivortices in the initial stage , we do not expect that the spin waves are fully propagating .",
    "we expect rather that , due to the interaction of the vortices with the background vortices and antivortices , they propagate only within a short range and then scatter off the vortices ( and antivortices ) in a complicated manner such that the mobility of an isolated vortex is enhanced with a logarithmic depence on the size of the system .",
    "spin autocorrelation function @xmath31 also was calculated which is expected to be related to the growing length scale @xmath1 through a new exponent @xmath3 as @xmath32 .",
    "we could extract the value of @xmath3 in the long time limit as @xmath4 .",
    "this result may be interpreted as @xmath33 for the present case . .",
    "we note that this value is quite distinct from the corresponding value of @xmath5 for the case of no reversible mode coupling which was calculated both theoretically as well as numerically @xcite .",
    "we consider the ordering kinetics of the soft spin model known as the model @xmath11 whose hamiltonian is given by @xmath34   = \\int d^2 r \\ , \\big [ \\frac{1}{2 } ( \\nabla \\vec{\\phi})^2 +   \\frac{1}{4 } ( \\vec{\\phi}^2 -1)^2 + \\frac{k}{2 } m^2 \\big ] \\la{eq2.1}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the two - component vector order parameter @xmath36 and @xmath17 is the third component conjugate to spin @xmath35 ( which corresponds to the @xmath29-component of the three - dimensional magnetization in heisenberg spin systems with easy plane anisotropy ) .",
    "when @xmath37 is set to zero , the above hamiltonian becomes equivalent to that of @xmath0 ginzburg - landau model .",
    "therefore , the order parameter has @xmath0 rotational symmetry on @xmath38-space and the equilibrium average of @xmath39 is zero .",
    "the model-@xmath11 hamiltonian , ( [ eq2.1 ] ) , does not contain static couplings between the order parameter @xmath35 and the @xmath39 field .",
    "( on the other hand , the model @xmath12 does contain such a static coupling . ) however , as can be seen below , _ dynamic _ couplings between these two fields arise from reversible mode coupling terms .",
    "the two fields @xmath35 and @xmath17 satisfy the following poisson bracket relations @xcite \\ { _ 1 ( r ) , m ( r^ ) } & = & -g _ 2 ( r ) ( r - r^ ) , + \\ { _ 2 ( r ) , m ( r^ ) } & = & g _ 1 ( r ) ( r - r^ ) , + \\ { _ 1 ( r ) , _ 2 ( r^ ) } & = & 0 where @xmath40 denotes the strength of the mode coupling that is an analog of the gyromagnetic ratio of the spins .",
    "these poisson bracket relations generate the reversible mode couplings in the equations of motion , which cause spin precession .",
    "they play a key role in the critical dynamics @xcite .",
    "note that the order parameter @xmath35 is not a conserved quantity . instead , conserved quantity in this system is the @xmath17 component which causes the precession of the order parameter @xmath35 in the @xmath41 plane of the spin space @xcite .",

    "@xmath52 is the poisson bracket of two generic dynamic variables @xmath8 and @xmath9 as defined above ( [ eq2.2 ] ) . with ( [ eq2.2 ] ) and the above relation ,",

    "we can see again that , in the limit of @xmath55 , the order parameter and @xmath17 are decoupled , resulting in the equation of motion for the order parameter equivalent to that of the time - dependent ginzburg - landau equation for @xmath0 model . the equation for @xmath17 in ( [ eq2.6 ] ) can be written in the form of a continuity equation & = & - _ m , + _ m & & g ( _ 2 _ 1 - _ 1 _ 2 ) - d k m + ( , t ) where @xmath56 is the corresponding current density .",

    "an important physical element brought on by the reversible mode coupling term is the existence of the propagating spin wave especially when we can neglect the existence of vortices and antivortices . in reference",
    "@xcite , in the quench dynamics of gross - pitaevskii equation , a linear growth of @xmath61 was found , which was conjectured to be due to the existence of propagating spin waves . here in the case of model @xmath11 ,",
    "however , we find only a minor enhancement with logarithmic correction to a diffusive growth .",

    ", we chose @xmath67 .",
    "the simulation results were the same for smaller time intervals .",
    "two main quantities of interest in phase ordering kinetics of this system are the equal - time spatial correlation of the order parameter defined by @xmath68 and the spin autocorrelation function @xmath31 defined as @xmath69    the equal - time spatial spin correlation function satisfies the simple dynamic scaling ( fig .",

    "this can be contrasted to the conventional purely diffusive case ( @xmath55 ) where the effective growth exponents obtained numerically are invariably smaller than @xmath23 .",
    "now , in order to understand this behavior , we construct a simple phenomenological model of coarsening of the system as follows . to begin with , we note that the coarsening of the system is dominated by the annihilation of vortex - antivortex pairs .",

    ", we assume that we can simplify the whole coarsening process ( corresponding to the growth of the length scale up to @xmath78 ) by the annihilation of _ single _ vortex - antivortex pair of size @xmath78 with suitably defined interaction potential and other dynamical parameters .    from previous works on the dynamics of a vortex in the related model systems of anisotropic heisenberg spin systems ( which is based on a collective variable approach ) @xcite",
    ", we might assume that the vortex acts like a small particle with finite mass moving under the influence of an external force with some ( length - scale dependent ) mobility .",
    "then the distance @xmath79 between a vortex and an anti - vortex would be described by the following equation of motion",

    "we will set @xmath85 .",
    "one important remaining question is how we set the functional form of the @xmath86 and @xmath87 . from the apparent superdiffusive behavior of the growing length scale obtained from the simple power law fit with an exponent a little larger than @xmath23",
    ", we guessed that the growing length scale might be represented , at least in the late time regime , as @xmath24 .",
    "if we neglect the mass term , this kind of positive logarithmic correction can be obtained by assuming a logarithmically divergent vortex mobility @xmath82 .",
    "similar phenomenon of logarithmically divergent mobility was also found in the quasi - two - dimensional diffusion of colloids @xcite or diffusion of protein molecules on the membranes @xcite under hydrodynamic effect , and also in the vortex diffusion in the anisotropic heisenberg system in two dimensions with spin precession @xcite . as for the form of @xmath86",
    ", we turned to the anisotropic heisenberg model where the effective mass of a vortex with logarithmic dependence on the length scale was derived @xcite .",
    "motivated by these phenomena in analogous systems , we assumed that the effective mass and the mobility are logarithmically dependent on @xmath79 as @xmath88 where @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 are constants and @xmath93 denotes a shortest cutoff length scale in the system ( corresponding to the vortex core size ) .",
    "note that @xmath89 corresponds to the effective mass at the shortest cutoff length scale and similarly for @xmath91 for the vortex mobility .",
    "the way we obtain the growth law from this simple model of vortex - antivortex pair dynamics is as follows .",
    "we first begin with a finite value of the size of vortex - antivortex pair @xmath94 . for convenience",
    ", we also set the initial velocity of the vortex to be zero .",
    "then we numerically solve the model equation of vortex - antivortex pair dynamics , ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) , to obtain the time @xmath95 when the size of the vortex - antivortex pair @xmath79 becomes equal to @xmath93 the lower cutoff length scale . by plotting the resulting relation @xmath96 and @xmath95",
    "we get the growth law of the coarsening dynamics",
    ".    it would be ideal if we could derive the parameters @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 from the full dynamic equations , ( 6 ) in the absence of thermal noise .",
    "but we do not know how to proceed from this equation to calculate these parameters .",
    "we simply tried to fit our simulation results ( especially the dependence of the growing length scale on time ) with the numerical solutions of our simple dynamic model with our tuned values of the parameters such that the two results agree most favorably .    in order to compare the numerical solutions of the simple dynamic model with the simulation results , we plot in fig .",
    "2b @xmath97 versus @xmath28 from which we can check the behavior of the ( multiplicative ) correction to the diffusive growth .",
    "it shows that there exists a smooth crossover from early time ( @xmath98 ) behavior with larger slope to later time behavior with smaller ( slower ) slope . the solid line in fig .",
    "2b represent the results of numerical solutions from the simple model of vortex annihilation where we chose the parameters @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 .",
    "we see that the numerical solution exhibits a reasonable agreement with the full simulation results ( open circles ) . from our numerical solutions to the simple model we see that the early time behavior comes from the effect of the inertial term .",
    "if the mobility of the vortex is assumed to be a constant independent of the size of the vortex - antivortex pair , then the inertial effect ceases to be effective in longer time regime and the correction term would approach a constant plateau .",
    "however , the real simulations of the coarsening exhibits a steady increase in the correction in the late time regime .",
    "that is why we incorporated a length - dependent mobility of the vortex with a logarithmic dependence on the size of the vortex - antivortex pair .",
    "we found that , as the coefficient @xmath92 of the logarithmic term increases , the later time correction with logarithmic behavior gets stronger ( data not shown here ) .    in the long time limit with large separation between vortices and antivortices",
    ", we can expect that the inertial effect would be negligible .",
    "therefore , due to the logarithmic divergence of the vortex mobility , we can analytically get the dominant asymptotic growth law as @xmath102 the numerical solution of ( 13 ) in the long time region , shown in fig .",
    "2b confirms this growth law .",
    "in addition , shown in fig .  3 are the relaxations of the vortex number density @xmath103 and the excess energy density @xmath104 in a log - log plot . from the logarithmic slopes , we get apparent power - law relaxation in time @xmath105 and @xmath106 . in order to understand the relationship between these relaxation behaviors and also this apparent growth exponent ( [ eq3.4 ] )",
    ", we note that there exists the so called energy scaling relation between the excess energy @xmath107 and the length scale @xmath71 of the domain growth for the case of @xmath0 models in two dimensions , i.e. , @xmath108 with @xmath109 denoting a short distance cutoff corresponding approximately to the size of a vortex core .",
    "this was first derived by bray and rutenberg @xcite . since the reversible mode coupling terms satisfy the energy conservation",
    ", this relation should be valid in the presence of mode coupling as well . from the excess energy relaxation ( obtained numerically )",
    "we can extract a length scale @xmath110 through the relation @xmath111 .",
    "we can also extract another length scale @xmath112 from the defect density relaxation that corresponds to the average separation between neighboring defects in such a way as @xmath113 which is based on the assumption that the vortices are uniformly ( and randomly ) distributed in two dimensional space .",
    "these two length scales as well as the numerical sulution to the aforementioned simple model of vortex - antivortex aniihilation , together with @xmath1 are displayed in fig .",
    "this figure shows that the length scale @xmath27 agrees with the growing length scale of the domains @xmath1 in almost entire times , which implies that the above bray - rutenberg relation is valid in the zero - temperature coarsening of the model e. the bray - rutenberg relation , together with the growth law ( [ eq3.7 ] ) , leads to the asymptotic relaxation behavior for @xmath26 as e(t ) & ~ & t^-1 ( 1 + ) figure  4a also shows that there is considerable difference between the length scale @xmath114 and the length scale @xmath1 .",
    "although this discrepancy appears to become smaller in the longer times , their agreement in the long time limit does not seem to be guaranteed .",

    "this value is much larger than the value of @xmath5 for the case of non - conserved @xmath0 model with no reversible mode coupling @xcite .",
    "it appears that the higher mobility of the vortices in the present model causes a faster decay of the autocorrelation and hence larger value of the @xmath3 exponent is ensued compared to the case of @xmath0 model without mode coupling terms",

    "this model was shown to describe closely the positive logarithmic corrections of the simulation data , where the inertial effect dominates in the early time stage , while the positive logarithmic effect of the vortex mobility dominates in the late time stage .",
    "we also investigated the autocorrelation function of the order parameter field . the numerical result on the value of @xmath3 exponent for the present case of the model",
    "@xmath11 is approximately @xmath4 which is quite distinct from the value @xmath119 for the case of purely dissipative dynamics of @xmath0 model without reversible mode couplings .",
    "even though we do not have an analytic proof , it also leads us to conjecture that @xmath120 for the model @xmath11 which seems to be closely related to the higher mobility of the vortices as compared to the case of no mode coupling .",
    "we think that the interaction of propagating spin waves ( generated by the mode coupling ) with the vortices ( and antivortices ) influence the motion of vortices ( and antivortices ) in such a way that the vortex mobility increases logarithmically on the sizes of vortex - antivortex pairs , thereby facilitating the annihilation of the vortex - antivortex pairs in the late time stage of coarsening process with a logarithmic correction to a diffusive growth .",
    "further investigation would be necessary to understand in more detail the interaction between the vortex defects as well as that between the vortices and the propagating spin waves .    in this work , we only considered the phase ordering kinetics of the model @xmath11 in two dimensions , in which static coupling between the order parameter field and the conserved field @xmath17 is ignored . in view of the recent surge of interest in the phase ordering kinetics in the ultra - cold atomic gases , it would be worthwhile to extend our study to the coarsening of the model @xmath12 which possess a static coupling between the order parameter field and the conserved third component . in ref .",
