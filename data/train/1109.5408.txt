    "trapped hff@xmath0 has been identified as a promising candidate for testing fundamental symmetries and extensions to the standard model through an electron electric dipole moment ( eedm ) search @xcite .",

    "the reduction in both the relevant sample number and coherence time can doubly hurt the sensitivity of an eedm experiment .",
    "hence , the state preparation of hff@xmath0 in a single rovibronic , zeeman level is an important but non - trivial task .",
    "the strategy we use to prepare hff@xmath0 in a state - selective manner is the autoionization of rydberg hff molecules excited from ground state hff using the optical - optical double resonance ( oodr ) technique @xcite .",

    "their ion - core is excited and decays after a short time , releasing energy to kick out the rydberg electron .",
    "will the resultant state of the ion have some memory of the state of its parent rydberg molecule ?    in principle",
    ", the above question can be answered by building a model of autoionization based on multichannel quantum defect theory ( mqdt ) @xcite , like that performed for caf @xcite .",
    "this model calculates the quantum defect matrix elements @xmath3 and their derivatives with respect to the internuclear distance @xmath4 and energy @xmath5 , which can then be used to describe the rydberg energy spectrum , dynamics of autoionization and resultant ion states .",
    "however , constructing such a quantum defect model demands extensive knowledge of rydberg levels to provide input parameters ; such knowledge is presently lacking for hff .",
    "alternatively , we tackle the question of rydberg state  ion state branching ratios by experimentally probing the post - autoionization states of hff@xmath0 with laser - induced fluorescence ( lif ) .",
    "ion lif has been reported before by other groups as a tool to examine the states of ions created from resonance - enhanced multiphoton ionization ( rempi ) @xcite , electron - impact ionization @xcite and ion - molecule collisions @xcite .",
    "a slightly different but related form of state detection is the grating - dispersed fluorescence obtained from highly - excited ions formed by photoionization using synchrotron light sources @xcite . in our experiment ,",
    "the ions are formed from a rydberg band at 54  @xmath1 above the lowest ionization threshold .",
    "the upper levels of this rydberg band are energetically allowed to decay only to the @xmath6 vibronic ground state of hff@xmath0 , although the ions could be spread out over as many as @xmath7 distinct @xmath2 rotational - zeeman sublevels .",
    "the ion distribution over the various @xmath2 states remain to be unveiled through their lif intensities .",
    "to predict the ion population distributions , which are connected to the observed fluorescence intensities , we present a simplified model of autoionization that assumes : 1 .",
    "the rydberg molecule has the same electronic ion - core as its autoionization product , and 2 .",
    "the rydberg electron flies off with the same angular momentum as it possessed when it was bound to the molecule , i.  e.  the dynamics of autoionization are radial only .",
    "the first assumption is based on the picture that the rydberg state undergoes vibrational autoionization as opposed to electronic autoionization ; in vibrational autoionization , propensity rules tend to favor a @xmath8 decay process @xcite .",
    "the second assumption means that unlike the quantum defect model , the simplified model neglects the matrix elements of @xmath9 that are off - diagonal in the rydberg electron s orbital angular momentum @xmath10 .",
    "we do not yet understand the hff rydberg spectrum sufficiently well , in fact , to independently test these two assumptions .",
    "instead , the severe lack of information obligates us to propose an initial model that is as simple as possible .",
    "as will be seen , the model can be adjusted to give a good account of the ion rotational distributions , and with no further adjustment it does well predicting the orientation and @xmath11 populations of a particular @xmath12 level .",
    "that said , on the basis of the present work alone , we can not rule out electronic autoionization nor the presence of angular dynamics in the autoionization process .",

    "we have spectroscopically characterized a vibronic band of the autoionization spectrum in hff at 54  @xmath1 above the lowest ionization threshold .",
    "we directly probe the decay of its rydberg states ( @xmath120 ) into various rotational states of the @xmath121 vibronic ground state of hff@xmath0 by performing laser - induced fluorescence on the ions .",
    "the measured fluorescence intensities are fit using a simplified model of autoionization that assumes no angular dynamics and that the rydberg state has the same electronic ion - core as its autoionized state .",
    "the fit parameters imply that the rydberg electron has dominant @xmath95 character with some mixing from the @xmath122 orbitals . using the same rydberg electron character ,",
    "the model predicts qualitative preservation of orientation when the rydberg molecule autoionizes to the @xmath101 state , which was corroborated by fluorescence intensity measurements carried out after excitation by a circularly polarized laser .",
    "thanks to a combination of rotational propensity , parity propensity and preservation of orientation during autoionization , we find that we can create as many as 30% of the hff@xmath0 ions in a single zeeman level of a rovibronic state .",
    "having an initial population of 30% of the ions in a single @xmath2 level could prove to be very advantageous for future experiments such as the eedm search .",
    "we note that although this work has concentrated on one vibronic band of a core - penetrating rydberg state , there is a body of core - nonpenetrating states in hff that has yet to be uncovered with experiment .",
    "core - nonpenetrating states have almost pure @xmath10 character . with @xmath123 for hff ,",
    "the rydberg electron hardly exerts a torque on the ion core rotational states when ejected , which means that the resultant ion rotational states are likely to follow that of the rydberg molecules more closely .",
