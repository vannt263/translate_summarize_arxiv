    "neutrino interactions have been studied in the resonance region in terms of form factors and have been compared with available data  @xcite with considerable success . after the early experiments with larger errors , there is a new generation of experiments that provide more accurate data .",
    "in addition , the oscillation phenomena and the finite mixing angle @xmath3  @xcite require more accurate theoretical predictions in order to decipher properties of oscillations including cp asymmetries .",
    "all these require on the theoretical side estimates of amplitudes that are reliable .    one property of production cross sections is the fact that for @xmath4 and @xmath5 the axial contribution is given by the partially conserved axialvector current ( pcac ) .",
    "we worked out this framework for resonance production  @xcite and for coherent scattering on nuclei it has been reported by two groups  @xcite . in this article we wish to present our results for many reactions , calculate explicitly the energy spectra of the produced pions and point out special properties .",
    "for example , in the production of the delta resonance in the energy region @xmath6 to @xmath7{gev}$ ] the vector squared and the interference contributions are almost equal  @xcite .",
    "they add up for neutrinos and cancel each other for antineutrinos leaving the axial current squared as the dominant contribution in the latter reaction .",
    "this will be tested in the experiments .",
    "it will also be useful for measuring the flux by using this and additional channels in the nearby detector and to predict the yield in the far away detector in order to establish deviations from normal oscillations , like the presence of a cp violating phase .",
    "the above property for antineutrino reactions is especially useful because the flux of the antineutrino beam will be smaller . for antineutrino interactions we find the cross section on a proton target to be smaller than on a neutron .",
    "early qualitative evidence for this ordering is already available for integrated cross sections  @xcite .    in this article",
    "we adopt the neutrino reaction @xmath8 as benchmark for comparing other reactions of charged and neutral currents . for @xmath9{gev}$ ]",
    "the delta resonance dominates and it has been shown that there is only a small background of 10% for other reactions .",
    "we shall assume that the @xmath10 amplitude dominates and thus obtain the antineutrino and neutral current reactions .",
    "later on , we may revisit the topic in order to study the changes brought about when we introduce a small nonresonant background .    in section  [ sec :",
    "energyspectrumandangulardependenceofpions ] we calculate the energy and angular spectrum of the pions for the small region of @xmath11 . for this",
    "we introduce the @xmath12 cross section in the rest frame of the resonance and then transform it to the laboratory frame of the neutrino interaction .",
    "details of the calculation are given in section  [ sec : energyspectrumandangulardependenceofpions ] and in the appendix .",
    "one worrisome aspect concerns the modifications brought about by the subsequent rescattering of pions in nuclei . here",
    "we make the observation that charge symmetry predicts similar corrections for @xmath13 and @xmath14 interactions on isoscalar nuclei .",
    "we shall use this property . for nuclear corrections",
    "we adopt a model for rescatterings which is both simple and transparent  @xcite .",
    "in fact , since some of the neutrino - nucleon reactions are predicted , we can use them to test the accuracy of nuclear corrections .    for isoscalar targets",
    "many structure functions are related by charge symmetry at both steps of the reaction : the initial neutrino - nucleon scattering and the subsequent pion nucleus interactions .",
    "consequently , several relations follow to be tested experimentally .",
    "finally , the results for @xmath15{gev^2}$ ] are useful for matching them to the form factors at higher values of @xmath11 .",
    "the contents of the article are arranged as follows . in section  [ sec : chargedandneutralcurrentreactions ] we define the general method and present charged and neutral current cross sections .",
    "we point out several regularities that are inherent in the cross sections .",
    "results for pion spectra in energy @xmath16 from the axial current are presented in section  [ sec : energyspectrumandangulardependenceofpions ] . for these calculations",
    "we introduce the energy and angular dependence of the reaction @xmath17 in the rest frame of the resonance and transform it to the laboratory frame .",
    "the details of the lorentz transformation are given in the appendix . in section  [ sec : nuclearcorrections ] we compute nuclear corrections for isoscalar targets and pay special attention to find charge symmetric reactions .",
    "the results will be useful for long baseline experiments in which we point out that in our kinematic region products of cross sections @xmath18 nuclear corrections will be very similar for the regenerated @xmath19 and @xmath20 beams .",
    "since the mass @xmath21 of the electron is very small we repeated the calculations with @xmath21 and the results are shown in figure  [ fig : electron ] .",
    "the article closes with a general discussion .",
    "the method can be extended to higher resonances in order to fill the transition region between resonances and deep inelastic scattering .",
    "in fact , another group  @xcite uses a dynamic hadron model for this purpose .",
    "we consider the reactions listed in table  [ tab : isoreactions ] .",
    "we take reaction  ( [ eq : vccp ] ) as a standard where for @xmath22 there is only the @xmath23 amplitude .",
    "the amplitude for @xmath24 is given by the clebsch - gordan coefficient ( cgc ) shown in the fourth column of table  [ tab : isoreactions ] .",
    "the cgc is the same for vector and axial - vector form factors and reduces the cross section by a factor of @xmath25 .",
    "when the subsequent decays to specific pion - nucleus channels are considered , there are additional cgcs .",
    "the results for vector , axial - vector and interference terms were computed in an earlier article  @xcite and the results are shown again in figure  [ fig : pcacold ] .",
    "considering next the reaction @xmath26 we use the same structure functions as for  ( [ eq : vccp ] ) , since they are related by charge symmetry , but the sign of the interference term in the cross section changes .",
    "we note in figure  [ fig : pcacold ] that the vector and interference terms are approximately equal and cancel each other for antineutrinos , leaving the axial contribution alone .",
    ".input quantities and isospin factors for various reactions .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the results of this study point to general properties which may be useful to other investigations . for the determination of oscillation parameters and the observation of cp asymmetries",
    "we need the yields of single pions from nuclear targets which have the same energy dependence for neutrino and antineutrino reactions .",
    "we point out that for isoscalar targets the nuclear corrections for @xmath13 and @xmath14 are equal provided that their energy spectrum at the production vertex are the same .",
    "this requires the production by neutrinos and antineutrinos to be the same .",
    "we pointed out that the structure functions for reactions  ( [ eq : vccp ] ) and  ( [ eq : avcc ] ) are the same by charge symmetry .",
    "the difference in the cross sections comes from the sign in front of @xmath27 .",
    "we remark now that the contribution of @xmath27 to the cross sections diminishes as @xmath28 increases .",
    "this is evident in equation  ( 2.10 ) of reference  @xcite and is apparent in figures  6    8 of reference  @xcite .",
    "the merging together of neutrino and antineutrino cross sections also occurs as @xmath29 .",
    "we pointed this out for neutral currents in figure  [ fig : isospinrelationsnc ] .",
    "it also happens in charged current reactions and we demonstrate it for @xmath30 and @xmath31 by repeating the calculation and replacing the muon mass by the electron mass . in figure  [ fig : electron ] we show the two cross sections together and for various energies .",
    "for the subsequent interaction the nuclear corrections on isoscalar targets will be the same for @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "these remarks suggest to use several reactions in the nearby detector in order to determine the fluxes and at the same time check the shapes and normalizations of pion production .",
    "then measure in the far away detector charge - symmetric reactions .",
    "ratios that follow from charge symmetry should provide checks at every step .",
    "for instance , in the charged current reactions the @xmath13 yield is dominant , but for antineutrinos the @xmath14 yield dominates .",
    "for neutral currents the @xmath32 yield is dominant and the sum @xmath33 is , within 5  % , equal to the @xmath32 yield .    then one can use the determined fluxes of @xmath34 and @xmath35 in order to compute the regenerated , through oscillations , @xmath19 and @xmath20 fluxes far away .    for charge symmetric reactions for which the products cross sections @xmath18 nuclear corrections are the same , the change in the yields at the far away detector should be proportional to the change in the fluxes , coming from the oscillations with or without cp violation .",
    "we carried out an extensive program of calculations in the kinematic region @xmath36 and @xmath37{gev^2}$ ] , where pcac gives the dominant contribution for the axial current .",
    "we give results for charged and neutral current reactions of neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "one interesting result , in the energy range @xmath38{gev}$ ] , is that the axial contribution dominates the @xmath39 reaction . in the calculations we kept the mass @xmath40 which produces the turn over in the differential cross sections @xmath1 as @xmath29 .",
    "the long baseline oscillation experiments will be searching for @xmath30 type reactions where @xmath41 and we repeated the results in figure  [ fig : electron ] .",
    "the pcac limiting point at @xmath42 is now finite .",
    "the energy spectra for the pions are also interesting and measurable . in section  [ sec : energyspectrumandangulardependenceofpions ] we outlined a method and carried out the calculations obtaining the energy and angular spectra of the pions with the help of transformations summarized in the appendix . since our estimates for the axial current are valid for @xmath43{gev^2}$ ] we limited the figures to that kinematic region .    for nuclear corrections we adopted the anp model which is both simple and transparent .",
    "we presented corrections for the incoherent sum of a proton and neutron target .",
    "they can be scaled up for other isoscalar nuclei ( c@xmath44 , o@xmath45 , ... ) by multiplying with the appropriate number of particles in the target and using the appropriate transfer matrix .",
    "then we pointed out that some general properties follow from charge symmetry .",
    "these relations follow from isospin rotations and should hold beyond the kinematic domains introduced by the validity of pcac .",
    "we hope that the method and results can be adopted in oscillation experiments searching for cp asymmetry in the leptonic sector .",
    "one of us ( eap ) wishes to thank drs .",
    "w. bardeen and s. parke for the hospitality at fermi laboratory and the humboldt foundation for a traveling grant .",
    "numerous discussions with dr .",
    "j. morfin and members of the minerva group helped us formulate the physical issues of this work .",
    "we define as center of mass system the frame where the resonance is at rest . in the laboratory the four - momentum of the excited resonance after",
    "the collision is @xmath46 we can bring the resonance to rest by the transformation parameter @xmath47 and the corresponding @xmath48 in the rest frame of the resonance with its invariant mass within its width by @xmath49 , the energy of the pion is @xmath50 with this information we can relate various quantities in the two frames .    the scattering angles of the pion satisfy @xmath51 the differential cross sections are related by @xmath52 and @xmath53 \\label{eq : apb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the jacobian @xmath54 derived from the above equation @xmath55 finally , we obtain @xmath56"
