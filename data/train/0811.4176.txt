    "the detection of temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) provided evidence that large - scale structure formation in the universe was seeded by small density fluctuations generated at early times .",
    "the statistical properties of these seeds are usually modelled with a gaussian random field .",
    "historically the gaussian approximation was introduced for mathematical convenience . in the absence of a solid model for the generation of density fluctuations",
    "the gaussian hypothesis was accepted on the basis of the central limit theorem ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the advent of inflationary models provided further support for gaussianity .",
    "small - amplitude curvature perturbations generated during a standard inflationary phase ( single field , slow roll ) are very nearly gaussian distributed ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , many variants of the inflationary scenario predict appreciable levels of primordial non - gaussianity . in terms of bardeen",
    "s gauge - invariant potential , @xmath7 , most of these models ( but not all , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can be reduced to the form : = + ( ^2-^2 ) , [ deffnl ] where @xmath8 is an auxiliary gaussian random field and @xmath0 quantifies the amount of primordial non - gaussianity .",
    "on subhorizon scales , @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the usual peculiar gravitational potential related to density fluctuations via poisson s equation . the parameter @xmath0 thus has the same sign as the skewness of the density probability distribution function .",
    "this local form of non - gaussianity ( note that equation ( [ deffnl ] ) applies in configuration space ) can be obtained from a truncated expansion of the effective inflaton potential @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 thus encodes information about the inflaton physics .",
    "standard inflation gives @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "however , even in this case , the non - linear evolution of perturbations on superhorizon scales yields an observable @xmath0 of order unity ( which , in reality , should be scale and redshift dependent ; @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "large values of @xmath12 naturally arise in multi - field inflation models ( e.g. @xcite ; for an extensive review see @xcite ) and even in cyclic or ekpyrotic models of the universe with no inflation @xcite .",
    "observational constraints on @xmath0 have been derived studying three - point statistics of temperature fluctuations in the cmb @xcite .",
    "the recent 5-year data from the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( wmap ) give @xmath13 at the 95 per cent confidence level @xcite .",
    "parallel studies on the same dataset give @xmath14 using minkowski functionals ( komatsu et al .",
    "2008 ) and @xmath15 from wavelet decomposition @xcite .",
    "some recent reanalyses of earlier",
    "3-year wmap data claim substantial evidence for positive @xmath0 : @xmath16 from the bispectrum of temperature fluctuations @xcite and @xmath17 from their one - point distribution function @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a study of minkowski functionals on the 3-year data gives @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "higher quality data are needed to improve these constraints .",
    "the upcoming planck satellite should be able to reduce the uncertainty in @xmath0 to @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one might use observational signatures of primordial non - gaussianity imprinted in the large - scale structure ( lss ) of the universe ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "ideally , one would like to use high - redshift probes as the non - linear growth of density fluctuations quickly superimposes a strong non - gaussian signal onto the primordial one so that the latter might then be difficult to recover . for instance , the large - scale distribution of neutral hydrogen in the era between hydrogen recombination and reionisation encodes information on @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this could be probed by detecting the redshifted hyperfine 21-cm transition with very low - frequency radio arrays from space . in principle , an experiment of this kind can limit @xmath0 to @xmath20 ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) . however , it is not clear yet whether such an experiment will ever be possible due to technical complexity and problematic foreground subtraction . at lower redshifts",
    ", @xmath0 can be constrained probing the statistics of rare events , as like as the mass function of galaxy groups and clusters @xcite .",
    "early attempts of using cluster counts to constrain @xmath0 have been rather inconclusive due to low - number statistics ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "even though cluster - mass estimates are still rather uncertain and massive objects are very rare , the observational perspectives look very promising . a number of galaxy surveys encompassing large fractions of the observable universe are being planned ( e.g. ground - based surveys as des , panstarrs , and lsst , and the satellite missions euclid and adept ) and could potentially lead to solid measurements of @xmath0 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]                data in table [ tabbeta ] have an amazing regularity .",
    "apart from a normalisation constant , each column ( row ) shows the same linear trend with @xmath4 ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "this suggests that , within the explored parameter range ( @xmath21 mpc@xmath6 and @xmath22 ) , ( k,)=_0(1-_1 ) ( 1-_2k ) .",
    "[ betafit ] we thus use this equation to fit the original data for the halo bias from gaussian and non - gaussian initial conditions and find @xmath23 at the 68.3 per cent confidence level .",
    "note that we computed the power spectra in finite - sized bins of the wavenumber , so that there is some degree of ambiguity in associating the results with a given value of @xmath4 .",
    "unfortunately the choice plays a role in determining @xmath24 as @xmath25 is a steep function of @xmath4 on the scales of interest . in table",
    "[ tabbeta ] and in equation ( [ betafit1 ] ) , we have used the arithmetic mean of the wavenumbers contributing to a given bin .",
    "if one instead uses the logarithmic center of the bin , @xmath26 is slightly reduced with a best - fitting value of @xmath27 .",
    "the parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 are unaltered . therefore",
    ", a systematic contribution @xmath30 should be added to the error budget of @xmath26 .",
    "equations ( [ deltab ] ) and ( [ deltabcorrected ] ) assume that the gaussian bias @xmath31 is constant with @xmath4 but this is only approximately true in the simulations .",
    "the fit in equation ( [ betafit1 ] ) , the table [ tabbeta ] and the figures ( [ fig_ngb1 ] ) and ( [ fig_ngb2 ] ) have been obtained by identifying @xmath31 with the actual bias measured in the gaussian simulation at each wavenumber . if , instead , the estimate for @xmath31 introduced in section 5.1 is used , one gets @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , slightly improving the goodness of the fit .    the quadratic dependence of @xmath35 on @xmath0 is rather surprising as it can not be straightforwardly derived from the simple models listed above .",
    "it might possibly arise from higher - order terms which have been neglected in the expansion that leads to equation ( [ deltab ] ) .",
    "anyway , it is clearly present in the simulations as it can be seen by looking at the variation of @xmath24 along a given row in table [ tabbeta ] . within the range of @xmath0 of physical interest ,",
    "the effect is rather small : the coefficient @xmath28 only corresponds to a few percent correction .",
    "note that a quadratic term breaks the symmetry in the amplitude of @xmath35 between non - linearity parameters with opposite sign and identical absolute value .",
    "it is hard to directly test this against our simulations as we just have two runs with @xmath36 and both of them correspond to rather small @xmath12 where the uncertainties in @xmath24 are large .",
    "an alternative explanation for a non - vanishing @xmath28 could be that it artificially derives from imposing a linear relation in @xmath37 to data that do not scale linearly for @xmath38 .",
    "indeed , just using datapoints with small values of @xmath31 we derive bigger values of @xmath24 for large @xmath0 ( more or less in line with @xmath39 ) .",
    "therefore , what is robust is that at least one of the scalings with @xmath31 or with @xmath0 is incorrect in equation ( [ deltab ] ) .",
    "we found that a scaling proportional to @xmath40 ( with @xmath41 and @xmath42 two adjustable parameters ) does slightly better ( in terms of reduced @xmath43 ) than @xmath44 , at least for @xmath45 mpc@xmath6 .",
    "however , since the scaling with @xmath37 has a sound theoretical basis @xcite we preferred to quote our results as in equation ( [ betafit ] ) . from the statistical point of view , the parameters ( [ betafit1 ] ) provide an acceptable description of the simulation data to high confidence for all values of @xmath31 .",
    "however , they are particularly accurate for @xmath46 , while @xmath47 ( with the same @xmath26 and @xmath29 ) has to preferred for smaller values of @xmath31 .",
    "the linear correction in @xmath4 should be thought of as the first - order term of a series expansion in the wavenumber .",
    "we attempted to determine the corresponding quadratic term by considering larger values of @xmath4 in the fit ( one bin more , up to @xmath48 mpc@xmath6 ) .",
    "however , values of @xmath35 become small compared with the numerical errors and we found that the quadratic parameter is badly constrained by the data ( @xmath49 ) while the other parameters remain nearly unchanged ( and get larger uncertainties ) . also note that the gaussian bias starts to depart from @xmath31 at @xmath50 mpc@xmath6 and it is not clear whether equation ( [ deltab ] ) should still be expected to hold in this regime . + @xcite derived an expression for @xmath35 which coincides with equation ( [ deltab ] ) but does not include the linear transfer function .",
    "theoretically , this is hard to understand , as non - gaussianity is generated well before matter - radiation equality and one should account for the linear evolution of density perturbations .",
    "anyway , due to the different @xmath4-dependence , their expression for @xmath35 provides a better fit to the simulation data than equation ( [ deltab ] ) when both models are allowed to vary in amplitude with a tunable free parameter . for the model of @xcite and @xmath51 for the model of @xcite ] none of them",
    ", however , provides such an accurate fit to the data as our equations ( [ betafit ] ) and ( [ betafit1 ] ) , which improve the @xmath43 by at least a factor of @xmath52 .",
    "slosar et al . ( 2008 ) have used equation ( [ deltab ] ) to constrain @xmath0 by considering measures of the clustering amplitude of luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) and quasars from the sloan digital sky survey . combining all datasets",
    ", they found @xmath53 at 95 per cent confidence .",
    "how would this result change based on our simulations ? disentangling the different contributions , the strongest constraints to @xmath0 in slosar et al .",
    "( 2008 ) come from the angular power spectrum of quasars with photometric redshifts in the range @xmath54 and a mean bias of @xmath55 .",
    "weaker limits are also contributed from the power spectrum of spectroscopic lrgs and the angular spectrum of photometric lrgs .",
    "( with a bias of @xmath56 at @xmath57 ) .",
    "figure ( [ fig_ngb2 ] ) and table [ tabbeta ] suggest that at the scales of interest ( @xmath58 mpc@xmath6 ) the model given in equation ( [ deltab ] ) tends to overestimate the scale - dependent bias seen in the simulations . therefore , to match an observed @xmath35 ,",
    "a larger value of @xmath12 is required than predicted by the analytic model . when applied to the data by slosar et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , our correction should thus give somewhat looser limits on @xmath0 .",
    "because of the strong @xmath4-dependence of the function @xmath24 it is impossible to give more precise estimates without fitting the power - spectrum data .",
    "note , however , that a steeper @xmath4-dependence potentially makes determinations of @xmath0 even more competitive with respect to studies of cmb anisotropies .",
    "we use a series of high - resolution n - body simulations to study the mass function and the clustering properties of dark - matter haloes arising from gaussian and non - gaussian initial conditions .",
    "in particular , we follow the formation of structure in a universe characterised by the best - fitting parameters from the third- and fifth - year wmap data releases .",
    "we consider non - gaussianity of the local type and we use eight different values of @xmath0 ( @xmath59 ) enclosing the parameter space currently allowed by studies of the cosmic microwave background .",
    "our main results can be summarised as follows .",
    "\\(i ) the mass function of dark - matter haloes varies with @xmath0 .",
    "larger values of the non - linearity parameter correspond to higher abundances of the most massive haloes .",
    "analytical models based on the press - schechter method @xcite are compatible with our simulated results for the ratio of the gaussian and non - gaussian mass functions only if the critical threshold for halo collapse is lowered to @xmath60",
    ". an accurate fit of the gaussian @xmath61 is necessary to derive the non - gaussian mass function from the aforementioned ratio .",
    "\\(ii ) we find that , in perfect analogy with the gaussian case @xcite , the halo mass function assumes an approximately universal form .",
    "this means that , when expressed in terms of suitable variables , its dependence on redshift and cosmology is erased to good precision ( nearly 10 per cent ) .",
    "we parameterise the @xmath0-dependence of the universal mass function and provide an accurate fit for its high - mass end . for @xmath62 and for masses",
    "@xmath63 , the best - fitting parameters for the non - gaussian halo mass function in equation ( [ eq_ourfit ] ) are given in equation ( [ linearfit ] ) and table [ tab_mff_small ] .",
    "this fit reproduces the mass function of friend - of - friends haloes with an accuracy of 5 per cent on top of a systematic contribution ( up to 10 per cent ) due to the non perfect universality . for applications requiring higher precision , an additional formula",
    "is provided : for @xmath64 and @xmath65 the fit in equations ( [ eq_ngmfz ] ) , ( [ eq_ourfit ] ) , and ( [ eq_zandfnlfit ] ) has to be preferred to the universal fit . on the other hand , for higher values of @xmath12 and for higher redshifts ,",
    "the universal fit gives a better and more economic ( in terms of parameters ) description of the data . in the gaussian case",
    ", we extend the fit to a larger interval of halo masses ( @xmath66 ) by combining simulations with different box sizes :  see equations ( [ eq_ourfit ] ) and ( [ eq_bestgaufit ] ) .",
    "our fitting function provides a precious tool to forecast constraints on @xmath0 from future surveys and to analyze current datasets .",
    "\\(iii ) the matter power - spectrum in non - gaussian cosmologies departs from the gaussian one already on very large scales . for values of @xmath0 within the current cmb constraints",
    "these scale - dependent deviations can be as high as two per cent at @xmath67 and increase with wavenumber .",
    "the discrepancy is systematic : models with positive @xmath0 have more large - scale power than the gaussian case and models with negative @xmath0 have less .",
    "this warns against the widespread habit of using the gaussian matter power spectrum to determine non - gaussian bias parameters when high - precision is required .",
    "it also suggests that primordial non - gaussianity modifies the shape and amplitude of the baryonic - oscillation feature in the two - point statistics and the convergence power spectrum in weak - lensing studies .",
    "\\(iv ) we present an accurate fitting formula for the linear bias of dark matter haloes arising from gaussian initial conditions extending previous work to larger mass intervals .",
    "this , together with the mass function fit mentioned above , can be used to constrain parameters of halo - occupation models from clustering data .",
    "\\(v ) finally , using the halo - matter cross spectrum , we confirm the strong @xmath4-dependence of the halo bias on large scales ( @xmath5 mpc@xmath6 ) which was already detected by @xcite . however , we show that commonly used parameterisations based on the peak - background split overestimate the effect for @xmath68 mpc@xmath6 .",
    "the discrepancy increases with the wavenumber and at @xmath69 mpc@xmath6 @xmath35 in the simulations changes sign with respect to the models . on top of this ,",
    "the analytic model for the scale - dependent part of the bias requires corrections which depend on the non - linearity parameter , the wavenumber and , possibly , also on redshift and clustering strength .",
    "equations ( [ deltabcorrected ] ) and ( [ betafit ] ) with the best - fitting parameters listed in ( [ betafit1 ] ) provide a fitting formula which accurately reproduces the outcome of the simulations for @xmath70 mpc@xmath6 and @xmath71 .",
    "this fit should be employed to constrain @xmath0 from future clustering data at low and high redshift .",

    "we acknowledge discussions with robert e. smith and tommaso giannantonio .",
    "while our paper was being submitted , a related work by desjacques , seljak & iliev ( 2008 ) appeared as a preprint .",

    "the initial positions and velocities of the particles in our n - body simulations have been generated using the zeldovich approximation .",
    "this method introduces long - lasting artificial transients in the growth of perturbations which might alter the halo mass function at the high - mass end even at very late epochs @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to start the simulation at a sufficiently high redshift to ensure that all transients have decayed within the cosmic time at which the simulation output is used for science applications .",
    "alternatively , less stringent requirements on the initial redshift are necessary if one uses second order lagrangian perturbation theory to displace particles at the initial time @xcite . the simpler zeldovich approximation ( which only requires the calculation of the gravitational potential ) is much more widespread . in this case , a few authors have investigated how to compute the optimal starting redshift ( see e.g. @xcite ) as well as quantified the effects of the initial redshift on the halo mass function @xcite and on the internal properties of dark matter haloes @xcite .",
    "these studies show that simulations of the concordance cosmology ( and gaussian initial conditions ) with initial redshifts of @xmath73 ( depending on the simulations specifications ) have converged to the correct solution by @xmath74 ( at least for halo masses @xmath75 ) . even though our @xmath76 is in the right ball park , it is important to test that our results are robust against changing initial redshift .",

    "our results show that this holds true also for relatively large values of @xmath0 ( see the right panel in figure a1 where @xmath80 ) : even though non - linearities in the initial conditions are slightly enhanced with respect to the gaussian case , at any given redshift the corresponding density field is also more evolved and the effect of the zeldovich transients on the halo mass function are again erased by @xmath81 .",
    "for this reason this paper only uses data from snapshots at @xmath82 which are accurate to better than 5 per cent ."

    "<S> we extend our fit to a wider range of halo masses ( @xmath3 ) and we also provide a consistent fit of the linear halo bias . we show that , for realistic values of @xmath0 , the matter power - spectrum in non - gaussian cosmologies departs from the gaussian one by up to two per cent on the scales where the baryonic - oscillation features are imprinted on the two - point statistics . finally , using both the halo power spectrum and the halo - matter cross spectrum , we confirm the strong @xmath4-dependence of the halo bias on large scales ( @xmath5 mpc@xmath6 ) which was already detected in previous studies . however , we find that commonly used parameterisations based on the peak - background split do not provide an accurate description of our simulations which present extra dependencies on the wavenumber , the non - linearity parameter and , possibly , the clustering strength . </S>",
