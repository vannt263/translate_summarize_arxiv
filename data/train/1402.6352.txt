    "we use the following notation :    @xmath4 of targets from which the sample is drawn    @xmath5 of targets with exactly @xmath6 candidates , where @xmath6 is a positive integer ; e.g. , @xmath7 of targets with a single planet candidate    @xmath8 of _ kepler  _ targets with one or more candidates @xmath9    @xmath10 of targets with two or more candidates @xmath11 , i.e. , the number of candidate multiple transiting planet systems , so @xmath12    @xmath13 of planet candidates @xmath14    @xmath15 of actual planets among the candidates    @xmath16 of actual planets among the single candidates    @xmath17 of false positives among the candidates , so @xmath18    @xmath19 the number of false positive planet candidates present among the multis    @xmath20 is the fidelity of the sample ( fraction of candidates that are planets )    @xmath21 the fidelity of the sample of single planet candidates    @xmath22 the average number of false positives per target @xmath23 .    as in paper i",
    ", we make the following two assumptions for our statistical estimates of the number of fps in multis :    \\1 ) fps are _ randomly distributed _ among the targets ;    \\2 ) there is _ no correlation _ between the probability of a target to host one or more detectable planets and to display fps .",
    "see sections 5 and 6 of this paper and section 2.2 of paper i for discussions of these assumptions .",
    "paper i used these two assumptions , together with observed values of @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 based on the koi ( _ kepler  _ object of interest ) planet candidate catalog in @xcite with the minor modifications presented in @xcite and an assumed lower bound on @xmath27 , to estimate lower bounds on the fidelity of candidates in various classes of candidate multi - planet systems .",
    "our methodology is similar , except that we assume a lower bound on @xmath28 rather than on @xmath27 and we use a more recent , larger , more uniform and better vetted set of planet candidates for our studies .",
    "assumption ( 1 ) implies that the expected number of targets with @xmath29 false positives , @xmath30 , is given by a poisson distribution of @xmath26 members whose mean is given by @xmath31 .",
    "the expected number of targets with @xmath29 false positives is given by the following formula :    @xmath32    where the approximation in equation ( 1 ) is valid for @xmath33 .",
    "this is clearly a good approximation because the number of planet candidates is less than two percent as large as the number of targets and the number of false positives by definition can not exceed the number of planet candidates ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "we compute below the expected number of _ kepler  _ multis in which at least one candidate is a fp . in some cases ,",
    "we make approximations that yield conservative estimates of the expected numbers of true planets ( i.e. , overestimate the expected number of fps ) .",
    "our results , presented in equations ( [ eq:2fp ] )  ( [ eq:2p2fp ] ) , are given as general formulae ; numerical values for a specified subset of _ kepler  _ candidates and an assumed fraction of the singles that are true planets , @xmath28 , are provided in section 4.1 ( see table [ tab : fpest ] ) .",
    "section 4.2 demonstrates that these formulas correctly estimate the number of identified fps in multis given the identified fp rate for singles ( see table [ tab : stattest ] ) .",
    "equation ( 1 ) yields estimates of the number of targets with two or three false positives :    @xmath35    @xmath36    where @xmath37 provides an upper bound on the number of targets that are classified as multis but actually contain a single planet and at least one false positive .",
    "the expected number of targets with four or more false positives is extremely small and can be neglected for our purposes .",
    "note that the expected number of targets with no planets and a single fp under the same assumptions is @xmath38    the assumed lack of correlation between the propensity of a target to have false positives and true planets implies of the probability of a given target hosting both a planet and one or more false positives is equal to the product of these individual probabilities .",
    "the probability of a target having a single detected transiting planet is bounded from above by @xmath39 , and the probability of it showing a false positive is likewise bounded by @xmath40 .",
    "thus , the estimated numbers of targets with at least one planet as well as one or more false positives are given by :    @xmath41    @xmath42    the expected number of targets with both a planet and three or more false positives is very small and can be neglected for our purposes .",
    "we note that no targets have yet been found to host more than two fps ( table [ tab : stattest ] ) .    to derive an estimate of the expected number of targets with multiple true planets as well as at least one fp , replace the first term in equations ( [ eq:1p1fp ] ) and ( [ eq:1p2fp ] ) , @xmath43 , with a term representing the probability of a given target having a multi - planet system , @xmath44 .",
    "( our use of @xmath44 leads to a slight over - estimate of the number of false positives among the multi - candidate systems , as it assumes all such systems contain at least two real transiting planets . )",

    "targets were imaged on different parts of the focal plane during different orientations .",
    "the data are grouped according to the `` quarter '' year during which observations were made , with the first group labeled q1 and subsequent quarters numbered sequentially : q2 , q3 , .... ] .",

    "( @xmath51 ) the orbital period @xmath52 days .",
    "( @xmath53 ) the transit light curve is u - shaped ( rather than v - shaped ) .",
    "we define a transit to be u - shaped if the best fit to the transit light curve implies that the entire planet is in front of the stellar disk at mid - transit with a confidence exceeding one standard deviation in estimated impact parameter , i.e. , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the impact parameter , @xmath56 is its + 1 standard deviation ( uncertainty ) , and @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the radii of the planet and the star , respectively .    criterion ( @xmath6 ) is employed to minimize bias in identification of singles relative to multis .",
    "criterion ( @xmath48 ) removes most if not all spurious ( non - astrophysical ) events and many signatures that are too noisy to characterize at the level required for validation .",
    "criterion ( @xmath50 ) is used to verify the periodicity of the transits .",
    "we added criterion ( @xmath51 ) because , as shown in figure [ fig : perdist ] , the ratio of the abundance of identified fps to candidate transiting planets in multis is twenty times as large for orbital periods @xmath0 days as it is for @xmath52 days .",
    "this implies that the eb and planet priors input into a statistical analysis to estimate the relative probability of transiting planet and eb sources are skewed towards ebs at short period and towards transiting planets at long periods .",
    "( see appendix b for further discussion of the period distributions of various classes of transit - like signatures . )",
    "while _ bona fide _ planetary transits with high impact parameter can be v - shaped , a far larger fraction of stellar eclipses have this form , inspiring criterion ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "note that the six criteria listed above exclude some well - known _",
    "kepler  _ planets , including the multiples kepler-10 @xcite and kepler-42 @xcite , each of which has only one planet candidate with @xmath52 days , and kepler-47 @xcite , which is a circumbinary system .",
    "( transits of circumbinary planets , i.e. , planets on p - type orbits , are irregularly spaced and of varying shapes , and have not been correctly identified by the _ kepler  _ automated transit search .",
    "we thus exclude circumbinary planets , which can be considered a separate class , with poorly - measured multiplicity because they are not discovered in a standardized manner . )",
    "however , these omissions are acceptable in the context of this work because the vast majority of _ kepler _ s candidate multis meet all six of the above criteria , and our goal is to examine systems that are relatively easy to validate with a high level of confidence rather than to address all viable candidate multiple planet systems .",
    "in order to validate a large sample of _ kepler  _ candidates as planets with a high level of confidence , we need to show that the expected number of fps in said sample is much smaller than the size of the sample .",
    "the statistical analysis presented above treats all _ kepler  _ targets as equally good for searching for planet candidates , and searching for individual candidates is assumed to be independent of the presence of other candidates .",
    "unfortunately , the dataset and search processes are not so simple .",
    "we are thus forced to make certain approximations that can not be rigorously justified . in doing so",
    ", we note that because it is more important to bound the false detections rate from above rather than to estimate its value precisely , we favor assumptions that overestimate the predicted fp rate in comparison to the number of multis included in the sample . according to equations ( [ eq:2fp ] )  ( [ eq:2p2fp ] ) , which we use to compute statistical estimates of the numbers of fps , this means we should avoid overestimating @xmath26 .",
    "paper iii describes the ensemble of planetary candidates . including all viable candidates as well as identified fps and false alarms ( fas , which are kois with s / n @xmath59 7.1 indicating that may well be spurious , i.e. , not astrophysical in origin , or were produced by intrinsic stellar variability or show fewer than three putative transits ; see paper iii for details ) yields a grand total of 466 multis ,",
    "the characteristics of which are presented in table 3 of paper iii .",
    "these active candidates , fps and fas were found by searching through the light curves of a total of 190,751 _ kepler  _ targets observed at some time during q1  q8 . after applying the six criteria listed in section 3",
    ", we have : @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 ( so @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) .    because of variations in photometric noise of a target , stellar size , magnitude and amount of time observed ,",
    "the targets provide a very heterogeneous sample with regards to planet detectability .",
    "thus , even if transiting planets were randomly distributed among the _ kepler  _ targets , we would expect some degree of clustering ( a bit less uniformity , i.e. , perhaps a few more multis , than a random distribution ) in detected planets .",
    "this implies that the appropriate value of @xmath26 for our statistical estimates of the numbers of fps in multis is smaller than 190,751 .",
    "unfortunately , it is not possible to make any sharp cuts in stellar host properties among the planet candidates , but we can examine trends in order to produce a more appropriate estimate of @xmath26 .",
    "table [ tab : targetcount ] lists number of targets and the number of multis as functions of the number of quarters during the q1 ",
    "q8 interval for which the target was observed .",
    "the discovery rate for multis ( broadly defined to include fps and fas ) , given in the last column of table [ tab : targetcount ] , decreases substantially when fewer than five quarters of observations exist .",
    "giant stars ( @xmath69 ) occupy @xmath70 of the _ kepler  _ target list but host only @xmath71 of the planet candidates .",
    "planets transiting giant stars produce smaller transit depths , hence , giant stars are a priori poor targets for transiting planet searches . the fraction of stars listed as unclassified in the _ kepler  _ input catalog ( kic ) that host planet candidates is less than half that of stars classified as dwarfs , suggesting that a majority of the kic unclassified stars are also giants .    to measure photometric suitability of a target for detection of planet candidates , we use the combined differential photometric precision ( cdpp ) , which is a measure photometric noise on timescales related to the transit duration .",
    "a cdpp of 20 ppm for 3-hour transit duration indicates that a 3-hour transit of depth 20 ppm would be expected to have an s / n = 1 @xcite .",
    "we use the 3-hour estimate from a q1  q10 _ kepler  _ pipeline run .",
    "( three hours is a close match to the typical transit duration of our sample . )",
    "figure [ fig : cdppdist ] shows a histogram of the cdpp distribution .",
    "the black line shows the entire _",
    "kepler  _ target q1  q8 sample and",
    "the red line shows the distribution for those targets from the q1 ",
    "q8 planet search with currently viable planet candidates ( singles or multis ) .",
    "we calculate a median cdpp value of 160 ppm for the planet candidate hosts , compared with 175 ppm for all _ kepler  _ targets .    based on our results shown in table [ tab : targetcount ] and figure [ fig : cdppdist ] , as well as the paucity of planet candidates orbiting giant stars , we choose to estimate the effective size of our target pool , @xmath26 , as follows : the median cdpp of targets hosting planet candidates is 160 ppm . we counted 70,008 targets classified as dwarfs ( @xmath72 ) in the kic , observed in the majority of the eight quarters searched , and with cdpp @xmath59 160 ppm .",
    "we then doubled this number so that the median photometric variability within the effective target pool is equal to the median photometric variability of _ kepler  _ planet candidate hosts , yielding @xmath73 .",
    "thus , the value of @xmath26 used for our fp estimates is equal to twice the number of targets that were observed for at least five of the eight quarters searched for transits and that have @xmath72 . note that by excluding unclassified stars , some of which are dwarfs , we slightly underestimate the effective number of targets , which is conservative in the sense of overestimating the numbers of fps in multis because @xmath26 appears in the denominators of equations ( [ eq:2fp ] )  ( [ eq:2p2fp ] ) .",

    "background stars are more common near the galactic plane , leading to a higher probability of finding background eclipsing binaries ( bgebs ) , so chance - alignment blends are not completely random .",
    "the overall effects of this skewed distribution are likely to be small because they average out in the same manner for single fps in multis as for fps among targets with only one identified pattern of transits ( singles ) , but suggest a bit of extra caution when assessing candidate multi - planet systems at low galactic latitude . given the similarity in the latitude distributions of _ kepler  _ targets and planet candidates evident in figure 12 , our incorporation of the concentration of background stars towards the galactic plane into criterion ( @xmath94 ) of our validation protocol presented in section 7 is sufficient to address this concern .",
    "we consider the most likely interlopers in our sample below .    a signal in a _ kepler  _ light curve that is interpreted as a planet candidate could be produced by a variety of processes , which we categorize as follows :    \\(i ) a planet transiting the _ kepler  _ target star    \\(ii ) a planet transiting a stellar companion to the _ kepler  _ target star    \\(iii ) a planet transiting a star not physically bound to the _ kepler  _ target star    \\(iv ) an eclipsing binary star system or other astrophysical phenomenon    \\(v ) false alarms resulting from noise , processing errors , etc .",
    "a multi with all candidates in category ( i ) is a clean planet detection , whereas any candidates in categories ( iv ) and ( v ) are clearly non - planetary fps / fas .",
    "but what of signals in categories ( ii ) and ( iii ) , and of multis composed of mixtures of planets in categories ( i )  ( iii ) ? two key derived properties of an individual planet , size and the radiation flux from its star that it intercepts ( insolation , and hence equilibrium temperature ) , require knowledge of the star being orbited , whereas the orbital period of the planet ( doppler shifted to the rest frame of our solar system , as discussed in @xcite ) does not . the derived age of the planet and distance of the planet from the solar system depend on the stellar system in which the planet orbits , hence mistaking ( ii ) for ( i ) does not affect these quantities .",
    "in contrast , from a planetary dynamics standpoint , the most important issue is whether or not all members of a multi orbit the same star ( see @xcite and section 6 ) , although planetary sizes are also of interest since masses are correlated with sizes . and for _ kepler _ s statistical census , it is critical to identify the star or at least the stellar system to which the planets are bound .",
    "planet validation must demonstrate that the statistically likelihood of a signal being an fp is quite small compared to that of it being produced by a planetary transit .",
    "thus , the probability of each candidate being in category ( iv ) or ( v ) must be very small .",

    ", we expect that few if any of these false alarms are included in our statistical analysis .",
    "our validation protocol also requires inspection of all individual folded light curves in the vicinity of transits ( paper iii ) , so it is unlikely that any such fas contaminate our sample of validated planets .",
    "the worst misidentification would be validating a target for which no signals are of planetary origin as a planetary system .",
    "the primary expected source of such entirely fp multis are pairs of eclipsing binaries , with an expectation value for the entire sample being considered that is given by equation ( [ eq:2fp ] ) to be significantly smaller than unity ( table [ tab : fpest ] ) . validating members of multis",

    "just @xmath100 are chance - alignment blends with transiting planets ( category iii above ) .",
    "thus , planets orbiting physically - associated stars are expected to be an order of magnitude more common among planet candidates than planets orbiting background stars .",
    "in contrast , fps from background eclipsing binaries are expected to be almost as common as those from ebs that are physically associated with the target ( either in a triple or higher multiplicity star system , or a secondary - only occultation by the target star ) , and for planets smaller than neptune , which represent most of the planets that we validate in our study , background ebs dominate bound ebs by more than an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "although the probability of a transit - like signal being produced by a background eclipsing binary is small when averaged over all targets , several factors lead to large variations from target to target .",
    "the fp estimates computed by @xcite and @xcite represent averages over a very heterogeneous sample and do not account for planetary multiplicity .",
    "the _ a priori _ likelihood of a chance - alignment blend for a given target depends on the population of background stars , which is more than an order of magnitude larger at the lowest galactic latitudes observed by _",
    "kepler  _ than at the highest latitudes @xcite .",
    "this likelihood also depends on the magnitude of the target star , depth of the transit signal , and the area around the target to which the transit can be localized , which varies by more than two orders of magnitude .",
    "the above mentioned factors are all positively correlated ( to varying degrees ) among planet candidates of a given target .",
    "such correlations do not affect our estimates of the number of multis that include a single fp , but they imply that the expected number of multiple fps is higher than predicted by equations ( [ eq:2fp ] ) , ( [ eq:3fp ] ) , ( [ eq:1p2fp ] ) and ( [ eq:2p2fp ] ) ) , although the differences from predicted values are not statistically significant . ] .",
    "fortunately , these equations give estimates substantially lower than the corresponding estimates for single fps in multis given by equations ( [ eq:1p1fp ] ) and ( [ eq:2p1fp ] ) , so our general conclusion that the fp rate is very small in multis still holds . _ nonetheless , the huge variations in localization of transit position imply that centroids computed using pixel - level data obtained by _",

    "moreover , this differential is likely to be even larger for multis because magnitude differences are typically larger between chance - alignment blends than between physically - associated stars , which are essentially the same distance from the observer , and most multi - planet systems contain small planets that would be difficult to detect around faint stars @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimate that chance - alignment blends from background transiting planets produce a bit less than @xmath101 of the signals classified as _",
    "kepler  _ planet candidates .",
    "thus , we expect that few if any of the multis that we validate as planetary systems are planetary systems that are not orbiting either the _ kepler  _ target star or a star that is gravitationally bound to the _",

    "moreover , we do not consider them to be false positives because they are true planets and true planetary systems .",
    "note that as we are not requiring spectral analysis of planet - host stars for validation , substantial errors in estimates of planet sizes may be present in our validated planet lists even in cases where the planets orbit the _ kepler  _ target - _ caveat emptor _ !",
    "the most insidious interlopers in our sample of validated planets are likely to involve stars that are physically bound to the _ kepler  _ target . these include planetary systems that orbit a secondary to the target , implying that the planets are significantly larger and intercept significantly less stellar flux than estimated assuming that they orbit the primary , as well as `` split systems '' containing two stars each with transiting planets on s - type orbits or one star with transiting planet(s ) and two ( typically fainter ) companion stars that form an eclipsing binary .",
    "systems of planets all of which orbit a physical companion to the _ kepler  _ target are more difficult to detect than those around the target because their transit signals suffer a dilution exceeding 50% , but nonetheless are likely to be more common than those orbiting chance - alignment , unbound , background stars ( blends ) .",
    "the abundance of split systems containing one or more planets orbiting the _ kepler  _ target together with a binary companion star that has transiting planets of its own or is eclipsed by a third star in the system can be estimated if additional assumptions along the line of those in section 2.4 of paper i are made .",
    "specifically , we assume that :    \\(1 ) half of the _ kepler  _ target stars are binaries , which is approximately correct . according to @xcite",
    "the fraction of star systems that are multiples is 44% , but because of triples and systems of higher multiplicity , the mean number of stellar companions to a given primary star exceeds 0.5 . also , the _ kepler  _ target list is a magnitude - limited sample , so it is somewhat biased in favor of binaries that consist of stars of comparable brightness relative to the volume - limited sample of @xcite .",
    "a counteracting bias is that if the two stars are sufficiently distant from one another to have been viewed as separate objects during target selection , the `` crowding '' may have been cause to reject both from the _ kepler  _ target list .",

    "\\(2 ) planets are as easy to detect ( at s / n @xmath49 10 ) in the _ kepler  _ data around stars in binaries as around single stars .",
    "this yields an overestimate of the number of detectable planets orbiting stars in binaries , both because of dilution and the fact that many of the secondary stars would be too faint and _ a priori _ poor for planet detection to have been included in the _ kepler  _ target list if they did not have a bright companion .",
    "\\(3 ) there is no correlation of the orientations of the two orbital planes of planetary systems orbiting bound stars .",
    "this assumption is expected to underestimate the number of split systems , because there is likely to be some tendency of alignment of orbital planes .",
    "\\(4 ) stars in binaries are equally likely to host planets as are single stars .",
    "we expect this assumption to lead to an overestimate of the fraction of observed transiting planets in binaries , because binary companions destabilize some planetary orbits and , as discussed in section 8 , the sample of _ kepler  _ multis does not show evidence for widespread stellar binarity .    as roughly 50% of solar - mass stars have a stellar companion ,",
    "there are @xmath102 stars being searched for planets and @xmath103 pairs of stars that could possess split systems .",
    "the total number of stars harboring one or more planet candidates is @xmath104 , where the term @xmath105 accounts for the targets with two stars each possessing at least one planet candidate .",
    "it follows that the fraction of all stars surveyed ( including binary companions ) that harbor at least one planet candidate is @xmath106 .",
    "the estimated fraction of binary stars for which each of the stellar components harbor a close companion whose eclipse , transits or occultations produce a planet candidate is the square of this fraction , assuming uncorrelated occurrence of planets around the two stars .",
    "thus the number of binary stars , @xmath105 , having a planet candidate around each stellar component is given by :    @xmath107    solving equation ( [ eq : bp ] ) iteratively yields @xmath108 mixed systems . for @xmath74 , 80% of such split systems with two planet candidates and more than 90% with three or more planet candidates are composed entirely of planets .",
    "we employ an alternative methodology to estimate the number of such split systems containing an eb fp , again neglecting any possible correlations in orbital planes .",
    "we first estimate the number of false positives caused by ebs for targets in triple ( or higher multiplicity ) star systems , @xmath109 , by summing the contributions identified in @xcite and @xcite and multiplying by 2357/2222 to account for the larger size of the sample of planet candidates that we are analyzing , yielding the estimate @xmath109 = 27 .",
    "the expected number of such contaminants is given by :    @xmath110    numerical estimates based on equations ( [ eq : bp ] ) and ( 10 ) suggest that @xmath79 4 or 5 mixed planetary systems and @xmath111 combinations of a bound eb and a planetary system ( the latter being included in eqs .",
    "[ eq:1p1fp ] and [ eq:2p1fp ] ) are present in the sample of _ kepler  _ multis .",
    "thus , under the four assumptions above , mixed planetary systems are estimated to represent @xmath71 of the sample and bound ebs occur in @xmath112 .",
    "but note that if orbital planes are correlated , or if planet occurrence is correlated , the number of split systems could be much greater than estimated from these statistical considerations alone .    according to @xcite and @xcite , who neglected planetary multiplicity ,",

    "kepler  _ targets are expected to be @xmath113 times more common among planet candidates than transit signals from ebs that are physically bound to the target ( implying a triple or higher multiplicity star system ) , and for candidate planets smaller than 6 @xmath114 , which represent an overwhelming majority of the planets that we validate in our study ( section 7 , especially criterion @xmath115 ) , the likelihood of planets orbiting a companion star exceeds bound ebs by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "these results of @xcite reinforce our general conclusions that the number of such stellar triple interlopers ( with one planet candidate being an eclipsing binary star system and therefore by all accounts an fp ) is likely to be quite small , but the number of split systems composed of true planets with different ( albeit bound ) stellar hosts is expected to be larger .    in sum , the percentage of ebs in multis is expected to be far smaller than that in singles .",
    "the percentage of transit signals in multis that result from planets orbiting stars other than the nominal _",

    "kepler_. nonetheless , these planetary interlopers are likely to be far more common than ebs in multis .",
    "@xcite estimated the number of `` split - multis '' , i.e. , multis that do not represent planets orbiting the same star , which include chance alignment blends as well as the physically - bound split systems discussed above .",
    "their study employed a statistical analysis of the number of candidate multis with orbital periods that , together with masses estimated from observed sizes , imply instability for planets orbiting the same star .",
    "they noted that two multis in the @xcite cumulative catalog , the 3-candidate system koi-284 and the 4-candidate system koi-2248 , would clearly be unstable for any reasonable planetary masses , but that all other multis are stable for sufficiently small orbital eccentricities and the assumed empirical mass - radius relationship that we reproduce in equations ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) in appendix d , and estimated the number of split - multis that would produce exactly two cases that appear unstable because of small period ratios .",
    "@xcite found that split planet pairs in multis ( each combination of two planet candidates of the same _ kepler  _ target is considered a single planet pair , so each @xmath6 candidate system has @xmath116 planet pairs ) represent 1.1  13% of the sample of planet pairs in multis presented by @xcite , with the quoted range corresponding to the 95% credible level , analogous to the 2@xmath117 range .",
    "these estimates are well above our estimates for fps in multis , so we consider the population of unstable multis further in this section . note",
    "that split - multis can be composed exclusively of planets , as is the case for koi-284 ( section 9.1 ; see also paper i and bryson et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the candidate pool that we consider for our statistical analysis , i.e. , those satisfying the criteria listed in section 3 , contains no unstable planet candidate pairs apart from the two noted by @xcite , despite the larger size of this new sample ( see appendix d ) .",
    "the koi-2248 system fails our validation criteria because only one of the candidates , koi-2248.01 , both passes our centroid tests for localization of the transit signal on the plane of the sky and has @xmath52 days .",
    "the planet candidate with a period similar to that of 2248.01 , 2248.04 , has too much centroid scatter to clearly distinguish whether its transit signature is from the nominal _",
    "kepler  _ target or a neighboring star that is about 4@xmath118 from the target star and 7% as bright as the _ kepler  _ target in the _ kepler  _ bandpass .",
    "therefore 2248.04 did not even pass the weaker form of transit localization that we would accept for validation of additional planet candidates of targets with two or more candidates that we are validating as planets .",
    "in contrast to koi-2248 , koi-284 passes all of our standard validation tests .",
    "but with only one such system , the population of split - multis among our validated planets does not lend itself to robust results from the type of analysis performed by @xcite .",
    "moreover , since all three candidates in koi-284 appear to be planets , we do not consider the split - multis results of @xcite to cast doubt upon our validation procedure .",
    "our goal is to validate a large number of _ kepler  _ multis as planets and to have few contaminants slip into our validated planet list . in order to achieve these goals , we require that to be validated as planets , at least two of a target star s planet candidates meet all six requirements for the statistical analysis stated in section 3 as well as the following additional criteria :    ( @xmath94 ) centroid analysis @xcite indicates that the location of the transit signal on the plane of the sky is coincident with that of the _ kepler  _ target star within the narrow tolerance ( typically @xmath119 of the area of the _ kepler  _ aperture ) specified in section 5.6 of paper iii and that the probability of the transit signal originating on another star is @xmath120 .",
    "( @xmath121 ) for orbital periods 1.6 days @xmath122 days , the signal - to - noise ratio requirement is increased to s / n @xmath49 15 ( through q14 ) .",
    "this requirement was added to insure a robust measurement of the transit shape because in this period range the ratio of the abundance of ebs to that of transiting planets is larger than it is for longer periods .",
    "( @xmath123 ) periods of neighboring planets are not so close as to suggest that the configuration being validated is dynamically unstable ( see appendix d ) .",
    "( @xmath115 ) the largest estimate of planet size ( 2@xmath117 upper bound ) is @xmath124 .",
    "this criterion is relaxed to @xmath125 if another planet candidate is orbiting sufficiently close that it either would not be in a stable orbit or would have larger transit timing variations than observed if the mass of the @xmath126 object exceeded 13 times the mass of jupiter ( see appendix d ) .",
    "these limits were chosen to exclude stars and brown dwarfs , the minimum size for which is @xmath127 @xcite .",
    "as stated above , we only validate systems in which two or more planet candidates meet all of the above requirements . fewer than 1 in 300",
    "_ kepler  _ targets meet these conditions and are thereby validated as multi - planet hosts by our methods .",
    "the probability that an additional candidate of one of these targets is actually a planet bound to the same host star is quite high , so we relax one of our validation requirements for such planet candidates . specifically , we impose a weaker form of criterion ( @xmath94 ) that allows for a somewhat larger uncertainty in the position of the transit signal on the plane of the sky ( but that nonetheless localizes the transit source to an area @xmath128 that of the _ kepler  _ aperture that includes the target star ; see paper iii ) .",
    "we also validate one candidate that fails one of our standard validation criteria but for which there is strong additional evidence for it being a planet orbiting the same star as six planets validated by our standard techniques ; see sections 11 for details .",
    "our statistical analysis predicts extremely few fps in multis , but astrophysical uncertainties in the planarity of multiple star / planet systems imply that we can not make a good estimate of the numbers of fps that may have passed our tests and contaminate our list of validated planets .",
    "specifically , fp rates from chance - alignment blends of a background signal in combination with a signal from the _ kepler  _ target are a quantifiable unknown . in contrast",
    ", the expected number of fps caused by a combination of one or more planets transiting the _ kepler  _ target and a physical companion pair of eclipsing binary stars can only be quantified if one knows or makes assumptions about correlations between the orbital plane of a planetary system around one star with the plane of a close binary that is physically bound to the planet - hosting star .",
    "if one assumes no such correlations , fps from physical triples can be estimated as a quantifiable unknown ( which has a very low expectation value ; see section 5 ) ; assuming strict coplanarity also gives quantifiable numbers , but an intermediate situation is likely to be correct , leading to an unquantified ( and with our present astrophysical knowledge unquantifiable ) unknown .",
    "similar divides are present among planets that are not all orbiting the target star ( section 5 ) .",
    "we expect the largest contaminants to our ensemble of validated planets presented in this work and in paper iii to be unquantified unknowns , with very small numbers of quantified unknowns ( and also of truly unknown unknowns , but this of course can not be proven ) . despite these caveats , we are confident that more than 99% of the objects that we validate as planets should indeed be true planets , and that in well over 90% of the cases , all of the validated planets that we associate with a given _",

    "the poor detectability of fgk - type companion stars having little doppler offset is due to the absorption lines that overlap .",
    "companions from 3500  6500 k would be detected by this technique , as such stars have strong absorption lines .",
    "this spectroscopic technique only detects companions located angularly within a narrow rectangle of solid angle of size @xmath132 , centered of the primary stars , set by the width of the entrance slit to the spectrometer and the seeing of typically @xmath133 .",
    "this small angular separation implies that most  secondary \" stars found by this technique would be gravitationally bound to the primary , and thus reside at the same distance from earth .",
    "the overwhelming majority of the 259 host stars of multis showed no spectral evidence of a stellar companion to the host star within @xmath134 of the primary star , corresponding to half of the slit - width ( @xmath135 ) of the keck - hires spectrometer .",
    "we find clear evidence for a stellar companion only around koi-2311 .",
    "this companion appears to have a radial velocity relative to the primary star of 13 km / s and is 15%@xmath1365% as bright in the continuum as the primary star .",
    "however , this system fails our validation tests in multiple ways : the longer period candidate , koi-2311.01 , has s / n @xmath137 ( fails criterion @xmath48 ) , so as koi-2311 has only one other candidate , it fails to qualify as a multi for our statistical tests discussed in sections 3 and 4 .",
    "neither planet candidate can be localized in the plane of the sky well enough to qualify for validation ( criterion @xmath94 ) .",
    "furthermore , the transit of the shorter period candidate is very long for its orbital period , and would require a very eccentric orbit to be consistent with the stellar density estimated from spectroscopic classification ; in contrast , the duration of the outer candidate s transit is very short for its orbital period .",

    "the most likely pollutants of systems of higher multiplicity are 1 fp plus two or more planets ; it is unlikely that any of the systems of 3 or more validated planets contains more than one fp , although that possibility can not be strictly excluded .",
    "provided that one does not consider planets transiting a stellar companion to the _ kepler  _ target as fps , the @xcite and @xcite studies suggest an fp rate for singles of only 7% , even after the upward adjustment of their estimates that neglect planetary multiplicity to apply to the subpopulation of singles as described in appendix c. using an fp rate for singles of 7% rather than 10% reduces our estimate of the number of fps in multis by more than 30% .",
    "these estimates are for the entire population of currently viable ( candidate ) multis that satisfy the six criteria listed in section 3 ; the subset of multis validated herein and in paper iii is smaller and so the equivalent estimates are also smaller . the bottom line is that unless orbital planes of planetary systems are highly correlated with those of close binaries that they are bound to within triple ( and higher multiplicity ) star systems , @xmath215 of the objects that we validate should be true transiting exoplanets .",

    "the purple and dashed curves rise rapidly at low galactic latitudes because , to first approximation , they are weighted quadratically in the spatial density of stars ( more precisely , the product of the spatial densities of target stars and background stars ) , whereas the solid curves are only weighted linearly . the spatial density of background stars drops by a factor of 15 from the lowest galactic latitude that _",

    "the combination of statistical uncertainties and unmodeled effects such as the dependance of aperture size on crowding in the star field and distance from the center of the _ kepler  _ field would need to be analyzed in greater detail to determine whether or not there is any significance to the small differences between the curves for targets and planet candidates .",
    "planetary transits and stellar eclipses produce periodic dips in the light curves of thousands of _ kepler  _ targets .",
    "comparing the distributions of periods of various classes of events provides both astrophysical insight and information useful for planet validation .",
    "the ensemble of planet candidates in multis ( pcms ) has a smaller fraction of members with short periods than do the viable single planet candidates found by _",
    "kepler_. identified false positives are even more concentrated at shorter orbital periods than are singles , and detached eclipsing binaries ( that were initially recognized as such and thus were not given koi numbers prior to 2013 ) are the most skewed to shorter periods ( figure [ fig : perdist ] ) .",
    "the curve representing the cumulative period distribution of pcms is concave upwards below periods of 3  4 days , then flattens out and gradually turns over at periods of 8  9 days .",
    "very few pcms have periods @xmath0 days .",
    "we first consider the differences between the distributions of multis and those of fps and ebs , concentrating on their implications for reliability of planets that we validate by multiplicity .",
    "we then turn to differences between single and multiple planet candidates , which may provide clues to the structure of planetary systems .",
    "false positives ( whose light curve signatures look very much like those of transiting planets ) are thought to be primarily caused by eclipsing binaries , so why is the period distribution of fps intermediate between those of ebs and transiting planets at short periods ?",
    "one possibility is that many of the fps are actually transiting planets , albeit perhaps not planets transiting the _ kepler  _ target star .",
    "an alternative , more likely , explanation for at least most of this difference is that a larger fraction of very short period ebs are easier to recognize as such because of the presence of secondary eclipses , tidal distortions , or other effects that more clearly distinguish the light curves of ebs that were not classified as kois ( starting in 2013 , some of these more obvious ebs were given koi numbers , but these numbers are larger than those of the range of kois considered for our study ) from those of transiting planets at short periods .",
    "thus , we expect that the period distribution of recognized fps is a better proxy for the distribution of unrecognized fps that pollute the sample of ( single and multiple ) planet candidates than is the distribution of ebs .",
    "using the period distribution of recognized false positives as a proxy for the distribution of unrecognized fps in the sample of planet candidates , we find that the ratio of the expected abundance of unidentified fps in multis to planets in multis is far larger at short orbital periods than at long ones . as only 1.6% of the pcms have @xmath0 days , compared to 27% of identified fps , the likelihood that a pcm with @xmath0 days is an unrecognized fp is more than an order of magnitude larger than that of a member of a multi with @xmath52 days .",
    "we thus do not consider planet candidates with @xmath0 days to be good prospects for validation by multiplicity .",
    "this is nt to imply that most or even any short - period pcms are not true planets , just that the probability of an fp slipping through our tests , which use a statistical approach that incorporates the relative frequencies of planets and of fps , is too large to consider them validated planets without a more detailed study than we perform .",
    "several factors may contribute to the much larger abundance of single planet candidates relative to that of pcms at very short periods ( @xmath0 days ) .",
    "it is possible that this apparent difference is spurious , either because the detection efficiency of sister planets of transiting short - period planets is very small or the bulk of the singles at these short periods are fps , but neither of these observational biases are likely to be strong enough to explain the magnitude of the difference observed ( @xcite and @xcite ; cf .",
    "thus , it appears that , like hot jupiters ( @xcite , @xcite ) , very hot planets of all sizes are more common in single transiting planet systems than they are in multiple transiting planet systems",
    ".    it may be that very close - in planets truly lack nearby planetary neighbors , as is the case for hot jupiters ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and/or that very close - in planets tend to have substantial orbital inclinations relative to more distant planets in their systems . in either case , tidal forces could be the culprit .",
    "neighboring planets might excite orbital eccentricities enough to lead to tidal decay of orbits into the star or to such short orbital periods that they are not efficienty identified by the _ kepler  _ pipeline . these very hot planets could have been scattered inwards and tidally circularized , with the scattering randomizing orbital planes and removing planets in nearby orbits . or they could have had their orbital inclinations damped to near the equatorial planes of their star , leading to non - planar systems .",
    "in this regard , note that the orbits of the two planets transiting kepler-10 , one of which has a period of 0.8 days , are inclined relative to one another by more than @xmath221 @xcite .",
    "@xcite have noted that few planets with @xmath222 days have neighbors with small period ratios ; this lack of close neighbors may be related to that of the overall deficit of planets with @xmath0 days in multis .",
    "there is also a small deficit of pcms relative to singles at periods above 100 days .",
    "further study is required to determine whether or not this is the consequence of observational factors such as the difficulty in detecting small planets at long periods combined with the tendency for fewer large planets to be seen in multis and differences in the processes of detecting singles and multis . if the difference reflects the true abundances of transiting planets , at least part of the cause is likely to be the smaller geometric probability of transits at longer periods yielding a smaller fraction of those multiple planet systems that lack close - in planets showing a second set of transits given one set being observed",
    "tools that aim to validate planet candidates statistically ( e.g. , blender ; @xcite , and the methods developed by @xcite ) require as input the base rates of the various astrophysical objects being considered , e.g. , abundances of planets vs.  binary stars .",
    "previous studies have assumed base rates for planets ( sometimes referred to as planet abundances or planet priors ) derived from the _ kepler  _ planet candidates observed in systems with both single and multiple planet candidates . when attempting to validate targets with a single transiting planet candidate , a more appropriate base rate would be derived from only the single _",
    "kepler  _ planet candidates . for the @xcite study ,",
    "this planet occurrence rate is about 1/3 less than the values computed using all _ kepler  _ planet candidates , since roughly 1/3 of the _ kepler  _ planet candidates in the @xcite cumulative catalog that formed the basis of the study by @xcite are members of multiple planet ( candidate ) systems .",
    "we caution that this fraction depends strongly on planet size and also somewhat on orbital period .",
    "this implies that the value of @xmath28 ( i.e. , the probability of a single transiting planet candidate being a planet ) is smaller than the estimated values quoted for the planet candidate population as a whole by @xcite .",
    "as @xmath223 , this correction increases the value of @xmath77 by roughly 50% if only eclipsing binaries are considered fps . the required adjustment is smaller in magnitude when one considers planets orbiting the _ kepler  _ target relative to planets orbiting stars other than the target .",
    "nevertheless , an increase in @xmath77 would still be present because the planets would need to be larger if they orbited a fainter star and the fraction of large planets found in multiple planet systems is smaller than that for small planets @xcite .",
    "note also that the required adjustments are smaller in magnitude for larger planet candidates than for smaller planet candidates because of the greater concentration of small planets in multiple planet systems .",
    "as the fraction of planet candidates in multis is higher for more recent catalogs such as the list used for our statistical study and the one presented in @xcite , the magnitude of this correction for singles is also larger if the same methodology is used .",
    "two of our criteria for planet validation require dynamical studies of systems under consideration . criterion ( @xmath123 ) implies that we need to remove systems that would be unstable for reasonable planetary masses .",
    "criterion ( @xmath115 ) allows us to validate objects large enough to be brown dwarfs only if dynamical limits on their masses from upper limits to observed transit timing variations of neighboring planets require them to be of planetary mass . we discuss the dynamical analyses we conduct in support of planet validation in this appendix .",
    "we perform two tests for stability .",
    "since stability depends on planetary masses and most of the planetary candidates do not have measured masses , for both of these tests we adopt a simple mass - radius relation employed by @xcite and @xcite : @xmath224    we use hill s criterion to test for stability of neighboring pairs of planet candidates . the mutual hill radius , @xmath225 , of two neighboring planets ( @xmath29 and @xmath226 ) depends on their masses , @xmath227 and @xmath228 , and their orbital semimajor axes , @xmath229 and @xmath230 , as : @xmath231^{1/3 } \\frac{(a_j+a_{j+1})}{2}. \\label{hillradius}\\ ] ]    hill s stability criterion for coplanar circular orbits is : @xmath232 two multis , koi-284 and koi-2248 , fail this stability test by amounts that can not be explained by any plausible errors in estimates of planetary masses , as noted by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "these two multis are discussed in section 6.2 .",
    "other systems that fail hill s criterion have high estimated impact parameters , which disqualifies them for validation herein , and they probably fail to satisfy equation ( [ hillscriterionforpairs ] ) because their radii and hence their masses are substantially overestimated .",
    "hill s stability criterion does not account for the additional destabilizing influence of multi - planet interactions present in systems with three or more planets . to find kois",
    "whose validity is dubious because of instabilities induced by the interactions of three or more planets , we follow @xcite and perform numerical integrations on systems where three planets are so close that @xmath233 the three multi - planet systems koi-157 ( kepler-11 ) , koi-707 ( kepler-33 ) , koi-806 ( kepler-30 ) have such tightly packed planets , but have been verified by detailed studies and already been tested for dynamical stability .",
    "other candidates that expression ( [ hillscriterionforthrees ] ) calls into question include koi-1831 and koi-1426 , whose candidates have impact parameters so high as to preclude validation by our protocol and thus are not considered further .",

    "we integrate these four systems , assuming initially circular and coplanar orbits and adopting the mass - radius relation given by equations ( 11 ) and ( [ mr - relation ] ) for 1 gyr to test for stability through direct simulations .",
    "our integrations used the hnbody symplectic integrator with 1/30th of the orbit period of the innermost candidate as our timestep @xcite .",
    "each system remained stable for the entire 1 gyr time interval simulated .",

    "our free parameters include the orbital periods at the epoch jd = 2,455,680 and the time of the first transit after this epoch .",
    "we assume coplanar orbits and fix the giant planet masses at @xmath236 .",
    "we also adopt circular orbits at epoch throughout to be conservative in our validation protocol , since nonzero eccentricities typically produce a similar range of simulated ttvs for a lower mass .",
    "we fix the masses of the remaining candidates in each system at values determined by the same mass - radius relation adopted in our stability analysis .",
    "if the simulated ttvs clearly exceed the observed ttvs in the candidate or candidates neighboring the giant , the giant can not be a brown dwarf or secondary star in the same system as the other candidate(s ) , so it passes criterion ( @xmath115 ) and remains eligible for validation .",
    "if the simulated ttvs do not clearly exceed the observed ttvs , we perform another fit to the transit times , letting the mass of the giant float , and we measure the change in @xmath205 per degree of freedom ( d.o.f . ) .",
    "if the measured mass @xmath237 at the best fit solution , and if the lower mass solution improves on the fit by @xmath238 relative to the fit with the giant s mass fixed at @xmath239 , there is evidence at the @xmath240 confidence level that the candidate s mass is too low for it to be considered a brown dwarf or a star and we consider it to have passed criterion ( @xmath115 ) .",
